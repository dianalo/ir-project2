Clauser, a manager at Smith Industries, a manufacturer of commercialaircraft instruments, found that ease of learning should be considered whenassessing a word processor's reliability and performance.andM;&quot;I don't have time to play around with an application that crashers or isbug-ridden,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;I have not encountered any problems withMacWrite.&quot;andM;FullWrite received the lowest scores in both overall reliability andperformance.andM;&quot;I don't want a program that hangs a machine,&quot; said Craig Uytake, aprogrammer for Rockwell Internation Corp., an aerospace company.andP;  &quot;FullWritedoes that.andP;  If it is running out of memory, the program will just hang thereuntil you discover that something is wrong.andP;  Then the file is alreadydisrupted.&quot;andM;&quot;In the beginning, FullWrite could not perform.andP;  It was ver slow,&quot; said JimMcBride, director of planning implementation for General Motors Corp.'sStrategic Planning division.andP;  &quot;The machine would lock up, and you would haveto reboot the system.&quot;andM;Next on the buyers' wish list for word-processing programs wastext-formatting capabilities.andM;&quot;Text formatting is probably what drives most word-processing programs,&quot; saidArco's Mullaney.andM;&quot;Inevitably, someonw will want to change a way that document looks.andP;  If aprogram accommodates these types of changes or demands, then it can easilyincrease the productivity of the worker and make their job easier,&quot; saidGeorge Lindorff, system administrator for Amgen Inc., a pharmaceuticalmanufacturer.andM;Microsoft Word received a score of 83 in text-formatting capability, sevenpoints ahead of its nearest competitor.andM;&quot;Text formatting for Word is ver thorough because it has predefined stylesheets for memos and correspondence,&quot; said MIT's Wolfson.andM;&quot;Word is better [than WordPerfect] at text formatting,&quot; said Mandamp;I DataServices' Blackstone.andP;  &quot;It has a richer command set to format the text.andP;  Inparticular, their tables and style sheets are easty to use.&quot;andM;Buyers were generally dissatisfied with the formatting capabilities offeredby the other programs; WordPerfect for the Mac received the lowest score inthis category--72 points.andM;&quot;WordPerfect on the Mac is lagging behind the PC version in text formatting,&quot;said Amgen's Lindorff.andP;  &quot;It seems like [the PC version] comes with all thefeatures and the Macintosh version is an afterthought.&quot;andM;Gordie Sands, a system manager at Reebok Internationl Ltd., encounteredproblems with WordPerfect for the Mac's text formatting.andP;  &quot;A command wouldwork, but it was dependent on where the cursor was relative to the embeddedcodes,&quot; he said.andM;WriteNow and MacWrite tied for top scores in Macintosh interfaceimplementation.andP;  Again, WordPerfect received the lowest score, a 63, which isfully 24 points lower than both WriteNow and MacWrite.andM;&quot;An interface is important because it makes the program easy to learn,&quot; saidMIT's Wolfson.andP;  &quot;MacWrite is excellent in that category.andP;  It adheres to the[Mac]interface 100 percent.andP;  The more powerful features in Word violate theMac interface.andP;  You have to acces them through the dialogue boxes, which canbe very cumbersome.&quot;andM;Greg Nicoson, a consultant for the University of Iowa, found WriteNows'sinterface easier to understand than Word's.andM;&quot;Mac interface implementation is important because we have a limited staff tosupport all of the students and faculty at the university,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;If theinterface adheres closely to the Macintosh, then there are fewer problems forus.andP;  WriteNow is easier to use and more intuitive.andP;  With WriteNow, we rarelyget a call on our support line.andP;  With Word, we have people calling all thetime.&quot;andM;Disappointing InterfaceandM;Buyers of WordPerfect, however, were disappointed with its implementation ofthe Mac user interface.andM;&quot;In the sense of using the [formatting] codes, WordPerfect is atrocious,&quot;said Reebok's Sands.andM;&quot;While Word use the Mac interface correctly, WordPerfect for the Mac isdisaster,&quot; added Blackstone.andP;  &quot;[The vendor] cried to bring over the DOSinterface.andP;  It has strange little status lines, and frankly, I don't knowanyone who uses it.&quot;andM;Ease of exporting and importing Mac-compatible files tied with clarity ofdocumentation for fourth place among attributes, according to respondents.andM;There was close scoring between Word and MacWrite in ease of exporting andimporting files.andP;  MIT's Wolfson explained the two-points edge to Word by itsbuyers.andM;&quot;You have the capability to import from everything with Word.andP;  MacWrite ismore limited,&quot; he said..andM;However, Niles Public Library's Jackiw was satisfied with MacWrite because itkeeps margins and styles.andP;  &quot;WordPerfect will only accept text and loses allformatting when you convert,&quot; he added.andM;Completeness and organization of documentation were less important to buyers.andM;&quot;Documentation is very important, but hardly anybody reads it,&quot; explained theUniversity of Iowa's Nicoson.andM;Buyers were pleased with the clarity, completeness and organization ofdocumentation offered for Word, WriteNow and MacWrite.andM;&quot;Microsoft offers a getting-started manual.andP;  I really like to see that,&quot; saidNicoson.andP;  &quot;A user can go through one simple book to get going.&quot;andM;WordPerfect and FullWrite documentation received lower scores.andM;Quality of product support was the next issue that buyers consideredimportant.andP;  While WordPerfect place fourth in overall score, it placed firstin quality of product support and accessibility of product support.andO;FullWrite received the lowest scores from its buyers in these categories.andM;&quot;One of the things that is appealing about WordPerfect is their support,&quot;said Amgen's Lindorff.andP;  &quot;In situations in which an operator is working onsomething, it is very easy to call WordPerfect and get help over the phone.&quot;andM;&quot;Of course WordPerfect support is great,&quot; said Mandamp;I Data Services' Blackstone.andO;&quot;Nobody calls them because nobody uses the product.andP;  It's like the Maytagrepairman--they're eager to talk to anybody.&quot;andM;&quot;Generally, Ashton-Tate is less a available than [other word-processingsoftware vendors]&quot; said Arco's Mullancy.andP;  &quot;They are not the easiest to reach,but once you reach them they do know what they are talking about.&quot;andM;Buyers next considered value relative to cost when purchasing aMac-compatible word processor.andP;  It this category, WriteNow placed first withan overall score of 82, while Word received a 78 from its buyers.andP;  Again,FullWrite was on the tail end with a score of 62.andM;&quot;WriteNow is definitely the least expensive software package and has a greatprice/performance,&quot; said Christopher Siegel, MIS director for Robert Seigel andamp;Associates, a real estate consulting firm.andM;&quot;If I were going for a page-layout package, then I may decide to go for Word.andO;But for a basic word-processing package it is too expensive,&quot; he added.andM;&quot;Word costs twice as much as WriteNow,&quot; said Nicoson.andP;  &quot;Word does not evencome close in offering twice as many capabilities for the price difference.&quot;andM;Ease of creating and using macros was rated the least importantcharacteristics, according to surveyed buyers.andM;&quot;You don't really use macros.andP;  They are hard to create, and when you docreate them they don't work out the way that you wanted them to.andP;  None of theprograms come up with a simple [macro] implementation,&quot; said Niles PublicLibrary's Jackiw.andM;&quot;Macros are really for the power user.andP;  Most users do not have a lot of userfor the macros because most documents do not have a lot of reptition,&quot; saidNicoson.andM;According to Arco's Mullaney, &quot;Most people in the Mac world learn with amouse in hard.andP;  Remembering a certain keystroke may take larger than pullingdown the menu bar with the mouse.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
