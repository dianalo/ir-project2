Go-Video has received purchase orders for 30,000 of theVCRs from its distributor, Dandamp;H Distributing Co., Harrisburg,Pa. Go-Video expects to fill those orders before the end ofthe year, said R. Terren Dunlap, chairman.</LP><TEXT>   The dual-deck VCRs, which allow viewers to duplicate tapesor play one while recording another, will retail at stores inthe Northwest, mid-Atlantic and Arizona, including SharperImage and Hammacher Schlemmer. At Hammacher Schlemmer, theVCR will retail for $1,295 and have a five-year warranty.   Go-Video acquired the technology for its VCR by taking agroup of Asian electronics companies to court two years ago,charging that they refused to sell it the technology to makethe decks. Samsung was dismissed as a defendant in that caseafter it agreed to make Go-Video's patented dual-deckrecorder. Litigation in that case is continuing againstseveral other manufacturers, and Go-Video filed a second suitagainst the companies in January, alleging that they havemonopolized the entire consumer-electronics business.
