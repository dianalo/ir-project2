The railway and industrial holding concern had net income of $195 million, or 65 cents a share, compared with $51 million, or 20 cents a share, a year earlier.    A spokesman said the fourth-quarter 80% rise in operating profit stemmed from improved results in bulk shipping and forest products and the reduction of losses from selling Cominco.    Full-year operating profit declined 41% because of lower oil prices and weak results from its rail operations and steel businesses. Operating profit was $150 million, or 50 cents a share, compared with 1985 net of $253 million, or $1.14 a share.    In 1986, a $362 million charge on the write-down of its bulk-shipping, steel and industrial-products investments; the $103 million gain on the Cominco sale, and a $29 million gain on the sale of CP Hotels' flight kitchens resulted in a net loss of $80 million.    There weren't any extraordinary items in 1985, but Canadian Pacific said its results for that year were restated following the retroactive decision by its PanCanadian Petroleum Ltd. unit to write down the value of its non-Canadian oil assets.    The company didn't disclose revenue for 1986. In 1985, Canadian Pacific had total revenue of $15 billion.    Canadian Pacific said 1986 results were hurt by lower profit at PanCanadian Petroleum and at the Algoma Steel Corp. unit, where demand for many of its steel products depends on the oil industry. Canadian Pacific's AMCA International Ltd. unit, a maker of steel products, also showed reduced earnings.    The company also attributed its lower earnings to weak traffic levels at its Canadian rail operation and a restructuring charge at Soo Line Corp., its U.S. rail unit.    Canadian Pacific said that it will report a gain of about $175 million in the current quarter on the previously reported sale of its airline to Pacific Western Airlines, which was completed Jan. 30. </TEXT></DOC>
