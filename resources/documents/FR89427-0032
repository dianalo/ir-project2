In compliance with the filing requirements of andSection; 355.12of the Commerce Regulations (19 CFR 355.12), petitioner alleges that manufacturers,producers and exporters of aluminum sulfate in Venezuela receive subsidieswithin the meaning of section 701 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended(the Act).Since Venezuela is a ``country under the Agreement'' within the meaningof section 701(b) of the Act, Title VII of the Act applies to this investigation,and the ITC is required to determine whether imports of the subject merchandisefrom Venezuela materially injure, or threaten material injury to, a U.S.industry.Petitioner has alleged it has standing to file the petition. Specifically,petitioner has alleged that it is an interested party as defined undersection 771(9)(C) of the Act and that it has filed the petition on behalfof a U.S. industry producing the product that is subject to this investigation.If any interested party as described under paragraphs (C), (D), (E), (F)or (G) of section 771(d) of the Act wishes to register support of or oppositionto this petition, please file written notification with the Commerce officialcited in the <T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT'' </T2>section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">Initiation of Investigation</ITAG>Under section 702(c) of the Act, we must make the determination on whetherto initiate a countervailing duty proceeding within 20 days after a petitionis filed. Section 702(b) of the Act requires the Department to initiatea countervailing duty proceeding whenever an interested party files a petition,on behalf of an industry, that (1) alleges the elements necessary for theimposition of a duty under section 701(a), and (2) is accompanied by informationreasonably available to the petitioner supporting the allegations. We haveexamined the petition on aluminum sulfate from Venezuela and have foundthat most of the programs alleged in the petition meet these requirements.Therefore, we are initiating a countervailing duty investigation to determinewhether Venezuelan manufacturers, producers, or exporters of aluminum sulfate,as described in the ``Scope of Investigation'' section of this notice,receive subsidies. However, we are not initiating an investigation on certainprograms because they were determined not countervailable in <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain ElectricalConductor Aluminum Redraw Rod from Venezuela </T3>(53 FR 24763, June 30,1988) (<T3>Redraw Rod</T3>) and new facts or information on changed circumstanceshas not been provided. If our investigation proceeds normally, we willmake our preliminary determination on or before June 22, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Investigation</ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted to the HarmonizedTariff Schedule (HTS), as provided for in section 1201 et seq. of the OmnibusTrade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawnfrom warehouse for consumption on or after this date will be classifiedsolely according to the appropriate HTS item number(s).The product covered by this investigation is aluminum sulfate from Venezuela,which is used in water purification, in waste water treatment, and forother industrial applications. Prior to January 1, 1989, such merchandisewas classifiable under item 417.1600 of the <T3>Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated (TSUSA). </T3>Thismerchandise is currently classifiable under HTS item 2833.22.00. The HTSitem number is provided for convenience and Customs purposes.
