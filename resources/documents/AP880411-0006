At stake is the future direction of oil prices, which havefallen steadily this year, partly due to increases in supply fromnon-OPEC nations.   Leaders of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesthis week are inviting government representatives from at leastseven independent oil-producing nations to meet with five OPEC oilministers in Vienna, where OPEC keeps its headquarters, on April23. All 13 OPEC members are to meet two days later.   The invitation, announced by a committee of five OPEC oilministers on Saturday, is a clear acknowledgement by the cartelthat it alone no longer can exert enough control over oil suppliesto keep prices up.   OPEC's president, Rilwanu Lukman of Nigeria, said the cartelsimply wanted to discuss ``methods of cooperation'' with non-OPECproducers. But the meeting probably will give rise to talks on oilproduction cuts intended to boost prices.   OPEC has an official target price for its oil of $18 a barrel,but little, if any, of its exports is fetching more than $15 abarrel. The loose association of oil-producing states has in pastyears been unable to prevent many of its own members fromunderselling.   For much of the past six years, OPEC has responded to decliningprices and a buildup of surplus by cutting its production. Althoughthis sometimes has provided a temporary boost to the market, OPECover time has suffered an erosion both of prices and exports.   The lower OPEC's output has fallen, the less influence it hascarried in the market and the more its poorer members, such asNigeria and Indonesia, have suffered.   Now the cartel is hoping that the prospect of further decline inprices this year will move non-OPEC oil producers to cooperate bysharing the financial burden of restraining oil supplies.   Oil production by non-OPEC nations has risen to 28 millionbarrels a day from 22 million a day in 1979. In that time, OPEC'soutput has tumbled from about 31 million barrels daily to 17.5million.   Mexico has indicated it wants to improve cooperation inrestraining oil supplies, but it is unclear how many otherindependent producers _ particularly the larger ones _ want to cuta deal with OPEC.   The United States, the world's second-largest oil producer, isvirtually certain to avoid any sort of cooperation with OPEC, as isBritain, whose North Sea oil makes it a major factor in the market.   The world's No. 1 producer, the Soviet Union, has shown littleinclination to act in concert with OPEC.   Those that have expressed interest recently _ including Egypt,Malaysia, Brunei, Oman and Angola _ are mostly small producers withlittle room to reduce their production.   Two years ago, OPEC held meetings with representatives ofMexico, Egypt and several other smaller producers in a vain attemptto agree on joint production cuts. OPEC was told that it mustreduce its output first before the independents would consider aresponse in kind.   Other independent producers include Norway and China.   The problem for OPEC then and now is that some of its members _notably cartel leader Saudi Arabia _ simply do not want to continuethe tactic of reducing production without firm pledges fromproducers outside OPEC. The Saudis, backed by their allies on theArabian Peninsula, think it's more important to preserve theircurrent share of world oil exports than to defend a fixed oil pricemost OPEC members ignore anyway.   Even so, OPEC has signaled that it is ready to make a freshattempt to change global oil relations by drawing independentproducers into an agreement.   OPEC President Lukman told reporters he saw an importantdifference between the current situation and that of two years ago.   ``The major difference is that non-OPEC have, on their own,realized the need to cooperate ... and they have made approachesvoluntarily ... to get together with us,'' he said.   In this industry of maverick nations, however, many obstaclesremain for an internally divided OPEC trying to bridge differenceswith independents.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Robert Burns has covered OPEC for The AssociatedPress for six years.</TEXT></DOC>
