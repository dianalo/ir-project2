The results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy(XPES) permit to identify the products of chemical interaction on theIn-LTT interface and to make conclusions on mechanisms of their formation.It is shown that combined application of auger- and XPES-spectroscopicmethods permits to obtain more complete data on chemical interactionin near-the-boundary range of metal-semiconductor contact.</TEXT></DOC>
