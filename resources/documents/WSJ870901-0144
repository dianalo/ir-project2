Cros for 4.3 billion pesetas ($35.2 million) and plans to increase its holding of 15% in Union de Explosivos Rio Tinto S.A., Spain's largest chemicals company. Ultimately, it intends to own 30% to 40% of each concern, which would give it a major role in planning the amalgamation of the two companies' fertilizers operations into a joint subsidiary. The proposed amalgamation would create one of Europe's biggest fertilizers producers, with annual revenue of about 100 billion pesetas.    AIR INTER, the state-controlled domestic French airline, has joined Amadeus, the European computer-reservations system founded in June by Air France, Lufthansa, Iberia and Scandinavian Airlines System.

A rival European group, called Galileo, consists of British Airways, Swissair, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, Alitalia, Austrian Airlines, British Caledonian Airways and Allegis Corp.'s Apollo reservations system. </TEXT></DOC>
