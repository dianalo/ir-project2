On the road to Damascus he became the apostle Paul who would carry the gospels of Jesus to a larger world. Christianity, the dominant religion of Western Civilization, was thus first propagated.    Arabia, where Paul secluded himself for a time before starting his Christian ministry, would a few centuries after Paul produce another prophet. Mohammed also was shaped in part by a study of Judaism. Islam would become yet another powerful world force. Judaism itself would survive centuries of blood and tears.    Christmastime reflection on these three great religions that had their origins in the Middle East is a needful reminder that history is an acting out of human visions. Even the great machines of war and peace are products of such visions. Policy makers court failure if they fail to understand how culture and religion shape those inner visions and thus the way men and women view themselves and the world.    In this Christmas week, we once again see on front pages and TV screens the violence of the Middle East. This time, some of it is in Jerusalem itself as Israeli soldiers attempt to subdue Arab rioters. The U.S. government, to express its disapproval of Israeli methods, Tuesday abstained from a Security Council resolution that &quot;strongly&quot; deplores the measures being used by the Israelis. American Jews are fearful of a loss of political support in the U.S. for Israel if the violence and countermeasures continue.    It is not heartening to contemplate the centuries of violence that have afflicted the northwest region of the Arabian peninsula before and since, in Lord Byron's words, the &quot;Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold&quot; in a fruitless effort to wipe out Judah. But we should remember that violence is no stranger to any corner of the globe; the true distinction of the Middle East is the great length and detail of its historical record.    That hardly helps us sort out the sources of Middle East turmoil today, of course. It is just as easy to overrate the importance of religion as to underrate it. Israel's two chief rabbinates bring significant influence to bear on the state, but a majority of citizens say they are not religious. Arabs living within the pre-1967 boundaries have both freedom and representation. Israel's Arab neighbors and Arabs in the occupied territories were early in the postwar period heavily influenced by Arab socialism, a secular movement. But some experts feel that Islam now is reasserting itself in the politics of the region.    The Arab riots in Israel, which come at a time when the country is relatively free of threats from the outside, may have arisen from discontents fanned by the socialist PLO or by fundamentalists, or both. Israel's economic troubles, which are attributable in part to its own forms of socialism, provide fertile ground for such trouble.    There are some thinkers who believe secularism is a remedy for violence. Removal of religious passion engenders rational thought, so the theory goes. There is, however, little consistent evidence to support such a view. Would Sir Isaac Newton have been more creative had he been less religious? Karl Marx thought religion was an opiate and certainly the officially atheist states that today profess to follow his teachings have shown no tendencies to forswear violence. Quite the opposite is true.    Indeed, it could be argued that religious belief is part of the nature of man, something that the state suppresses only with great damage to its social and economic progress. Religion may stir the passions, but it also lifts the spirit, generating aspirations and creativity. The American experience has demonstrated that democracy and minority rights are protections against religious intolerance.    It is a sad thing that conflicts with roots in religion still trouble the lands where Solomon once reigned, St. Paul preached and Mohammed taught. But the fact that this time of year brings celebration, not mourning, tells us something about what the inner voices of men and women tell them about the history their forebears have lived. </TEXT></DOC>
