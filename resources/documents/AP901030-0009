The research, together with a preliminary finding that drinkingboosts the risk of a fatal cocaine overdose about 20-fold in peoplewith severe coronary heart disease, may help explain the puzzlingoverdose deaths in people with surprisingly little of the drug intheir blood at autopsy.   New studies show that this third substance, manufactured in theliver from cocaine and alcohol, can mimic some actions of cocainein the brain. Drinking is frequently combined with cocaine use,according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse.   Researchers spoke in telephone interviews about studies thatwere presented Monday at the annual meeting of the Society forNeuroscience in St. Louis.   The substance is a close chemical cousin of cocaine calledcocaethylene. Further studies of it may give leads for medicationsto treat cocaine addiction by blocking cocaine's effects, saidstudy co-author Deborah Mash, a neuropharmacologist at theUniversity of Miami School of Medicine.   Scientists found that cocaethylene affects a brain-cellcommunication system thought to produce the euphoria that leads tococaine addiction, she said.   Prior research suggests that cocaine produces its high byintervening in this system, in which brain cells signal each otherwith a chemical called dopamine. After a dose of dopamine reachesits target cell, it is supposed to be brought back to its originalhome by molecules called transporters. But cocaine blocks thismechanism by binding to transporters, keeping the signal turned``on'' and producing a sense of pleasure, scientists say.   The new work shows that cocaethylene also binds to thetransporters, suggesting it may boost cocaine's effect, Mash said.In addition, she said, it appears less able than cocaine tomoderate the euphoria through a second brain communication system.   Another possible role of cocaethylene deals with cocaineoverdose deaths in people with severe coronary artery disease.   The overdose study found no elevated risk for people withmoderate or mild coronary disease, said co-author Dr. JamesRuttenber of the federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.   The study included about 240 cases of fatal cocaine overdose anda comparable number of deaths from other causes in people who hadtaken cocaine, Ruttenber said.   Mash said cocaethylene might play a role in the elevated riskbecause it can cling to brain cell sites that are supposed toattract a brain-communication substance called acetylcholine.   This may interfere with the brain's control of the heart pumpingrhythm, she said. If the heart is already affected by heartdisease, the result could be sudden death, she suggested.   Ruttenber said that less than 20 percent of overdose deaths inthe study involved severe heart disease and that it is not clearwhether cocaethylene contributed to the elevated risk.   But if it did, he said, it may also play a role in the morecommon puzzle of overdose deaths in people with surprisingly littlecocaine in their blood.   About 40 percent of overdose deaths in the study fit thatcategory, and it has been noticed before, he said.   For cocaine users, he said, such cases suggests that ``even ifthey are careful about the quantities of cocaine they use, theystill may not be able to ward off a fatal overdose.''   Michael Kuhar, a NIDA neuroscientist who did not participate inthe studies, said the suggested roles for cocaethylene areplausible. It is ``a new entity we don't know much about,'' hesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
