Thwarting the Irish Republican Army operation in the Britishcolony through pooled British, Irish and Spanish intelligence was atriumph for international cooperation against terrorism, but thecircumstances raised questions:   Was it necessary to shoot the guerrillas dead when they wereunarmed? Why did Britain wait 24 hours to declare the falsity ofofficial reports that a car bomb already had been parked at theGibraltar governor's residence?   The guerrillas were shot Sunday. On Tuesday, Spanish policefound a car laden with explosives in a parking lot at Marbella, aresort about 45 miles up the coast of southern Spain from thefortress colony.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's supporters said the discoveryvindicated the army in the shootings.   ``I am delighted,'' said lawmaker Ivor Stanbrook, who heads aParliament committee on Nothern Ireland. ``This confirms all theevidence which showed that the actions of the British securityservices were absolutely justified.''   Two men and a woman were shot down at midday Sunday as theywalked from a car they had parked at the governor's residence,called The Convent. A public changing of the guard ceremony wasscheduled for Tuesday morning, involving a British army unit justtransferred from Northern Ireland.   Men dressed in jeans did the shooting, and were said to bemembers of the elite Special Air Services undercover unit. The SAShas been involved in several operations against the outlawed IRA, amainly Roman Catholic group fighting to drive the British fromProtestant-dominated Northern Ireland.   Protests came from the Irish Republic and from inside Britain.   The mass-circulation press backed Mrs. Thatcher but the DailyTelegraph, usually pro-government in Irish matters, said Britainshould ``give ill-wishers no further grounds to suggest that theauthorities operate a `shoot-to-kill' policy against terrorists.''   In Dublin, the respected Irish Times commented: ``There isemerging a profound difference between British and Irish attitudeson the proper response which is demanded by terrorism.''   Immediately after the shootings, Spanish police and Britishofficials in Gibraltar spoke of a ``gun battle'' and a ``car bomb.''   Then the IRA said early Monday the slain trio were in Gibraltar``on active service,'' reinforcing Britain's contention that thebomb was in place.   Britain's armed forces minister, Ian Stanley, described the carparked near the governor's residence as a ``car bomb'' and Britishpress reports spoke of hundreds of pounds of explosives.   Not until Monday afternoon did Sir Geoffrey Howe, the foreignsecretary, tell a surprised House of Commons there were noexplosives in the car and police were searching for another vehicle.   Official British sources say confusion arose because ofassumptions based on Spanish intelligence and underlined by the IRAreference to ``active service.''   Why the immediate resort to gunfire? The response was thatsecurity forces could not be sure the guerrillas were not armed.   Reporters in London were told Mairead Farrell, an IRA veteran,``fumbled in her handbag,'' and ``could have been going for a gun,for some explosive device, anything.''   On Tuesday, the Irish government said it was ``gravelyperturbed'' that unarmed Irish people ``should have been shot dead... when it appears they could have been arrested.''   This enraged British officials and one said privately: ``A lotof British people are beginning to wonder if they (the Irish) areserious about combating terrorism.''   British officials said the 145 pounds of explosives packed intothe car found at Marbella, timed to explode during the militaryceremony Tuesday, could have killed more than 100 people. Theguerrillas apparently parked the first vehicle to secure a spacefor the car bomb when arrived later.   The shooting came at an awkward moment in Anglo-Irish relations.   Tensions arose in January when Britain announced it would notprosecute Northern Ireland police officers involved in killing sixRoman Catholics, five of them guerrillas but unarmed, in threeincidents at the end of 1982.   Those shootings had ``remarkable similarities'' to that inGibraltar, the Irish Times said.   Soon after the government announcement, a British soldier in awatchtower shot an unarmed Catholic civilian dead at a checkpointon the Irish border. The soldier, who is in custody, said it was anaccident but the Irish government ordered its own inquiry.</TEXT></DOC>
