Students in Seoul and four other cities also demanded therelease of a jailed leader authorities believe sympathizes withCommunist North Korea.   Police estimated the total number of protesters Fridaythroughout the country was 1,800. They reported some arrests, butdid not give figures.   About 250 students shouting ``Yankee go home!'' and ``Drive outthe Yankees who invaded Panama!'' fought riot police who blockedthem from marching off the Dongkuk University campus after a rallyagainst the government and United States.   The students denounced the U.S. invasion of Panama as ``animperialistic show of military force.''   Police fired tear gas to keep the Dongkuk students from marchinginto the streets. There were no reports of arrests or injuries inthe 90-minute confrontation.   The Dongkuk students shouted slogans demanding immediatewithdrawal of U.S. troops from Panama and South Korea. About 43,000American soldiers are stationed in South Korea under a 1954 mutualdefense treaty.   Police raided the Dongkuk campus before dawn Friday and seized30 radical students accused of pro-North Korean activities.   Clashes also took place near a downtown market in Seoul whenhundreds of students from several colleges occupied a section of aneight-lane street. Police firing tear gas dispersed the students,who threw hundreds of firebombs.   Riot police firing barrages of tear gas moved into severalcampuses in the southern cities of Kwangju, Taegu, Pusan and Taejonto crush violent protests demanding the release of radical leaderIm Chong-suk.   Im, 23, leads a radical group called the National Council ofStudent Representatives and police had sought him for six months inconnection with previous violent demonstrations.   He also is accused of sending a woman radical student leader, ImSu-kyong, to a world youth festival in North Korea in July withoutgovernment approval. The two Ims are unrelated.   South Korean citizens are not allowed to visit the North withoutofficial permission.   Three leaders of the largest dissident group, the UnitedNational Democratic Movement, delivered a letter denouncing theU.S. military action in Panama to the U.S. Embassy on Friday. Theembassy said it would have no comment.   Korean radicals are a vocal minority in the nation of 42million, but have little public support because of their extremeviews and actions.</TEXT></DOC>
