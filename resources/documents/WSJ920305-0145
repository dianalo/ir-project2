The service would rely on many low-orbit satellites toreach customers with handheld phones in any part of theworld. The action came earlier this week at the end of theInternational Telecommunications Union's World AdministrativeRadio Conference here.</LP><TEXT>   The decision to set aside a dedicated band -- 1610-1626.5MHz -- for mobile satellite services allows U.S. projects tomove forward. Motorola Inc.'s Iridium unit, TRW Inc., andLoral Corp. have proposed satellite-based mobile telephoneservices. The Federal Communications Commission is expectedto act soon to issue licenses for the new services.   Iridium, for instance, has proposed a $3.5 billionpersonal communications system using 77 low-earth-orbitsatellites. The company plans to begin launching thesatellites in 1994, and the system would be in full operationabout three years later. The company said it will be signingup other members of an operating consortium and will beseeking licenses in countries around the world.</TEXT></DOC>
