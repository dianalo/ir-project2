Theneed for the utility industry to adapt to market forces if it hopes tosurvive and prosper is clear. The US Congress has recognized these challengesand funded a least-cost utility planning initiative intended to ensurethat the public receives reliable, low-cost energy services. Least-costutility planning represents an approach to utility resource planningin which both supply- and demand-side data options are assessed for theirpotential contribution toward providing adequate and reliable energyservices for the lowest cost. As a part of the initiative, the US Departmentof Energy (DOE) received an appropriation to promote least-cost planningwithin the nation's electric and gas utilities. The provisions of thelegislation called for DOE to develop a plan that describes the research,technology transfer, and other activities that DOE will undertake topromote and strengthen least-cost planning practices nationwide. Thispaper presents the major elements of that research plan as well as somethoughts from utility planning experts consulted extensively during developmentof the plan. 1 fig., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
