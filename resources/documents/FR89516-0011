Stahl, Director, TSCAAssistance Office (TS-799), Office of Toxic Substances, Rm.

Thedocument EPA submitted to OFR for publication inadvertently omitted changesin 40 CFR Parts 796 and 798 that were made during the numerous in-houserevision cycles. These changes were not made in the final rule publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, but were apparently nevertheless incorporatedin the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) issued in 1986. Therefore, thereare discrepancies between the toxic substances test guidelines in 40 CFRParts 796 and 798 published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of September 27, 1985, and those codified inthe CFR's of 1986 and 1987.As the original September 27, 1985 daily issue publication is the controllingversion, OFR issued a correction document, published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of December 20, 1988 (53 FR 51099), that conformsthe CFR to the September 27, 1985 <T4>Federal Register</T4> final rule. EPA is issuing these technical amendmentsto 40 CFR Parts 796 and 798 because most of the changes that were inadvertentlyomitted from the <T4>Federal Register</T4> final rule of September 27, 1985 were intendedand should be reinstated in the CFR.Codification of these technical amendments to guidelines does not imposeany regulatory obligation on any person who may be subject to the ToxicSubstances Control Act (TSCA) section 4 test rule. Specific guidelinesdo not become mandatory test standards until they are promulgated as suchin individual section 4 rulemakings. When promulgated in such test rules,the pertinent TSCA guidelines become test standards for only that particularsection 4 rule and do not serve as generic test standards. EPA may proposemodifications to the various guidelines as they are utilized for chemical-specifictest rules. In each chemical-specific rule, the proposed test standardsand any modification will be subject to public comment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Parts 796 and 798</ITAG>Testing, Environmental protection, Chemical fate, Environmental effects,Chemicals.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 8, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Victor J.
