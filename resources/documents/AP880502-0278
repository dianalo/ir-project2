(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Phillips Petroleum Co. said Monday ithas designed a plan it hopes will ease employees' jitters about apossible takeover.   The ``work force stabilization plan,'' approved by the board ofdirectors last week, would provide qualified employees withseverance pay and other benefits should they be terminated withoutcause within two years of a takeover.   Chairman C.J. Silas said the plan had been under considerationfor some time and was not in response to any anticipated takeoverattempt.   ``Phillips has been mentioned frequently as a takeovercandidate, and the board has been concerned that such speculationis affecting our ability to retain and motivate employees, andtherefore how well we're able to perform for our currentshareholders,'' Silas said.   Phillips fought off unfriendly takeover attempts in 1984 and1985. Partly as a result of costs incurred in those battles,Phillips has reduced its workforce by nearly one-fourth.   The protection plan includes enhanced severance pay of up to twoyears based on years of service, retirement benefits, home purchaseprovisions and extension of medical, dental and life insurancebenefits.   The plan covers eligible longtime Phillips employees on U.S.payrolls who are terminated without cause within two years of thetrigger date, or employees who resign after a material loss ofposition, salary or benefits.</TEXT></DOC>
