North's defense by challenging the Iran-Contra prosecutor'scontention that the former presidential aide illegally subvertedCongress' role in foreign affairs.   The department says it is not seeking dismissal of the centralcharge that North, former national security adviser John M.Poindexter, arms dealers Albert Hakim and retired Air Force Maj.Gen. Richard V. Secord conspired to illegally divert U.S.-Iranarms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   But in a friend-of-the-court brief filed Friday in federal court,the department disputed independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh'scontention that North and his co-defendants stymied congressionaloversight ``through deceit and concealment'' of their covertoperation to help the Nicaraguan rebels.   A department official said the brief was filed only after ``muchanguish'' and with ``great reluctance.''   Echoing statements by North and his lawyers, the department said:``This case, in fact, arises in the context of a profound policydispute between the executive and legislative branches with respectto foreign affairs.''   ``A prosecutor acting in the midst of such a dispute mustexercise great caution _ first, to distinguish violations of lawfrom policy disagreements which are the expected and naturalby-product of separated powers, and to make certain that the lawsare applied consistently with the scope of the president'ssubstantial constitutional authority in the area of foreignaffairs.''   Walsh's brief ``does not demonstrate sufficient caution in eitherrespect,'' the department said.   The Justice Department's statement was filed in response to alegal argument Walsh made in a brief last month that ``the entireclandestine program in support of the Contras financed by Northaimed to defeat and obstruct the lawful functions of the Congress.''   Walsh said the defendants conspired to defraud the government by``deceitfully interfering with the constitutional appropriations andoversight functions of Congress, and the policies adopted as aresult of Congress' exercise of those functions.''   Walsh said the defendants violated a number of congressionalrestrictions, including the so-called Boland Amendments' ban on aidto the Nicarauguan rebels, known as Contras. The series of BolandAmendments were enacted as part of spending bills.   The department took no position on whether the Boland Amendmentsapplied to North and other National Security Council aides. But itsaid: ``Congress cannot through its appropriations or other powersinvade any sphere of constitutional authority granted exclusively tothe president.''   The Justice Department argued that Walsh incorrectly assigned toCongress broad powers over foreign affairs not provided by theconstitution.   ``Contrary to the IC's suggestion, there is a sphere ofpresidential activity that could not constitutionally be limited byany congressional enactment,'' said the brief by Assistant AttorneysGeneral Edward S.G. Dennis Jr., head of the criminal division, andDouglas W. Kmiec, head of the office of legal counsel.   Invoking the doctrine of executive privilege, the JusticeDepartment also challenged Walsh's assertion that Congress must bekept informed of covert operations.   ``Because of the doctrine of executive privilege and thepresident's inherent foreign affairs authority, Congress' authorityto compel disclosure of information concerning covert activity isnecessarily subject to formidable constitutional limitations.''   The department did not dispute Walsh's proposition that thecharge covers a conspiracy to violate federal laws and to defraudPresident Reagan by corrupting his efforts to free American hostagesby selling arms to Iran.   Dennis told reporters a court's adoption of the department'sposition would ``not necessarily'' result in dismissal ofallegations in the indictment's first count that the defendantsillegally helped arm the Contras.   Kmiec said ``there's no basis'' to any suggestion that the briefwas filed to create a legal justification for presidential pardonsof North and his co-defendants.   ``The brief is crafted and filed only in response to thememorandum filed by the IC at the end of October,'' he said. It wasfiled ``only after much anguish and with great reluctance.''   Spokesman Loye Miller said: ``the Justice Department has not cometo the defense of Oliver North. The fact that Oliver North is thedefendant involved in the case is coincidental.''   ``If a special prosecutor had taken the same position'' aboutCongress' foreign policy role in another case, ``the issue would bethe same,'' Miller said. ``The executive branch would be veryupset.''   In a statement, Walsh's office said, ``The Justice Department'smemorandum misstates our brief. It is addressed largely tocollateral issues that should obscure the criminal charges in theindictment returned by the grand jury.''   North, who is set to be the first of the four Iran-Contradefendants to stand trial, is also charged with 15 other felonies,including lying to Congress, obstructing a presidentialinvestigation of the Iran-Contra affair and pocketing $90,000 intravelers' checks from the Contras.   No date has been set for his trial.</TEXT></DOC>
