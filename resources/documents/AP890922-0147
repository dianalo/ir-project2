Michel Aoun onFriday accepted an Arab peace plan aimed at ending a blood bathbetween his forces and Syrian troops that has claimed almost 1,000lives in the past six months.   ``We declare to our people, all our people in the liberated aswell as the (Syrian-) occupied areas, that September 23rd is thebeginning of the chance to achieve peace,'' Aoun said in atwo-minute television address.   Syria, which controls 70 percent of Lebanon, and its Lebaneseallies have already accepted the Arab League plan.   Aoun said he agreed to the Arab League plan, which begins with acease-fire, after ``appeals from the international community, allthe Arabs and all the friends, and in line with the Lebanesepeople's desire.''   Immediately after Aoun spoke, a television announcer reportedthat two mortar rounds had crashed into a Christian army positionabove Beirut, but they caused no casualties or damage.   Several previous cease-fires called by the Arab League havefailed to end the fighting, and Aoun has blamed the violations onthe Syrians.   The shrunken population of Beirut appeared to take the call forpeace seriously. Many citizens took to the streets and began firingguns in the air in a traditional expression of joy.   Others drove through streets blanketed with debris, honking theircar horns.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Bouchersaid, ``We hope that this will result quickly in a cease-fire by allthe parties to the conflict.''   Aoun conveyed his acceptance of the plan to Arab League envoyLakhdar Ibrahimi during a meeting in his bunker-office under thebomb-ravaged presidential palace.   After the 40-minute meeting, Aoun told reporters: ``We wishsuccess to the peace plan. We've given peace a chance and, Godwilling, there will be peace.''   ``The results will be positive if the intentions are sincere. Ifnot, we reserve the right to take proper decisions at the propertime,'' he said.   Ibrahimi, assistant secretary-general of the 22-member ArabLeague, said after his meeting with Aoun that the Lebanese ``as ofnow, will be able to reopen their shops, go to schools and return totheir homes.'' About 90 percent of Beirut's 1.5 million people havefled the city.   Ibrahimi, an Algerian diplomat, was asked by an Arab Leaguecommittee to head a security committee to supervise the cease-fireand monitor ships to ensure that no weapons reach Lebanese factions.   Aoun initially said he would not send a representative to such acommittee because it did not include a Syrian member. Aoun saw thatas submitting to Syria's efforts to portray the crisis as one amongLebanese factions, even though Syrian forces in Lebanon are the mainopponent of the Christians.   But France and the United States, traditional backers of theChristians, and several Arab governments voiced support for thepeace plan and urged Aoun to be flexible to avoid further bloodshed.   Ibrahimi arrived in Beirut on Sunday, a day after the peace planwas announced by the Arab committee.   Acting Prime Minister Salim Hoss, a Sunni Moslem who heads aSyrian-backed Cabinet vying for legitimacy with Aoun's Christiangovernment, and Parliament speaker Hussein Husseini, a ShiiteMoslem, have accepted the plan.   Shiite militia cheiftain Nabih Berri and Druse warlord WalidJumblatt _ Syria's main allies in Lebanon _ also endorsed it.   The plan's first six points focus on the cease-fire and steps toenforce it. They include a call for the lifting of blockades onports and the country's only international airport, a halt inweapons imports and propaganda campaigns and a plea to foreigncountries to stop the flow of arms and ammunition to Lebanon.   The last clause calls for a meeting of the 99-seat Parliament onSept. 30, outide Lebanon, to discuss political reforms to statisfyMoslem demands for an equal share of power with the Christians.   Christians have dominated the government, legislature, army andjudiciary since independence from France in 1943, when they were themajority.   Moslems are now believed to make up 55 percent of the populationof 4 million, even though there has been no official census since1932.   Aoun has complained that the Arab plan makes no reference to aSyrian withdrawal from the country, and Ibrahimi made no referenceto that in his statement.   The Syrians maintain 40,000 troops in Moslem regions under a 1976Arab League peacekeeping mandate.   Before Ibrahimi's meeting with Aoun, police reported that twopeople were killed and seven wounded in artillery and rockets duelsin and around Beirut overnight.   That brought the overall toll to 929 killed and 2,738 woundedsince the Christian-Syrian confrontation erupted March 8. It hasdeveloped into one of the most destructive rounds of violence sincethe civil war broke out in April 1975.</TEXT></DOC>
