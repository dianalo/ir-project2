Ogden quit after three stormy years as Continental Illinois Corp.'s No. 2 man, a move expected since last April when he was denied the top job.    The banking concern said the other half of the management team hired by the federal government, John E. Swearingen, chairman and chief executive officer, would assume Mr. Ogden's duties until a new team is found. Mr. Swearingen, who was responsible in April for denying the top job to Mr. Ogden, is also searching for a new chief executive to replace himself. Mr. Swearingen has said he hopes to retire this summer.    Yesterday, Mr. Ogden for the most part refused to discuss reported troubles he had with the gruff Mr. Swearingen, a former chief executive of Standard Oil Co. of Indiana (now Amoco Corp.), and with others at the parent company of Continental Illinois National Bank andamp; Trust Co. of Chicago. He said he plans to remain in Chicago, will clean out his desk by the end of the month, and hasn't yet made any business plans.    &quot;I don't even want to admit that things went wrong,&quot; Mr. Ogden said, sitting in his ornate second-floor office, just a short walk from the chairman's corner suite that he had coveted.    But things did go wrong -- and early on -- for the chain-smoking Mr. Ogden, a former vice chairman of Chase Manhattan Corp. who was hired along with Mr. Swearingen after Continental collapsed and was rescued by federal regulators in a $4.5 billion bailout in 1984. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. installed the two men, both known as autocratic and sometimes difficult to get along with, as supposed equals, with Mr. Ogden chairman of the bank and Mr. Swearingen chairman of the holding company.    A director once called the arrangement a &quot;two-headed monster,&quot; and according to people close to Continental board, Mr. Swearingen in late 1985 was unhappy and decided that the board must name a single chief.    The bank never publicly disclosed that Mr. Ogden's status had changed. But people close to the board said that at a stormy meeting between directors and William M. Isaac, then chairman of the FDIC, Mr. Swearingen won the backing of the board and was named the undisputed chief executive.    &quot;Ogden could have walked, but he didn't,&quot; said one of the people close to the board. &quot;It was a very different deal than he agreed to. He never would have agreed to it in the first place.&quot;    Yet Mr. Ogden, 59 years old, stayed on, still hoping that he would succeed Mr. Swearingen, who is 68. He said yesterday that it wasn't until about two weeks before Mr. Swearingen announced last April that he would look elsewhere for new management that he knew he had been denied the job.    Mr. Isaac wouldn't comment on those events, but said: &quot;From the beginning, Bill Ogden didn't view this as a perfect arrangement. There were one or two occasions when he wanted to leave, but he hung in there. It was courageous.&quot;    Mr. Ogden wouldn't comment on the early struggle. However, he did speak more freely than he has in the past about his sometimes difficult relations with subordinates -- and about Continental's uncertain prospects. &quot;The old culture in this bank was never (to) criticize -- in fact, never inquire,&quot; he said. &quot;I was sort of a shock to that old culture.&quot; Describing himself as tough yet fair, Mr. Ogden said he was &quot;loved&quot; by the &quot;good people,&quot; but that &quot;some of the other people&quot; didn't like his management style. &quot;It exposes them a little,&quot; he said.    Except among some officers he recruited to the bank, Mr. Ogden wasn't greatly popular and the decision to deny him the top job was a well-supported one, Continental officers said.    Mr. Ogden said there's &quot;no doubt&quot; that Continental is poorly positioned to compete with other big banks, having sold off many of its most attractive units to stay afloat in 1984. But he said those who say the bank's recovery has slackened &quot;too quickly and too easily forget what the problems at Continental were. This was the biggest economic failure in the world.&quot; The international run on Continental's deposits reached about $20 billion before its bailout. </TEXT></DOC>
