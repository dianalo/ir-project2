Mostanalysts, however, expect earnings to look somewhat better inthe current quarter.   In the April-June period, net income of 633 majorcorporations fell 25% from a year earlier, a Wall StreetJournal survey shows. After-tax earnings from continuingoperations dropped 25% in the second quarter. This was anespecially sorry performance because the comparison is with aweak quarter in 1990, when net fell 11%.</LP><TEXT>   The results surprised many analysts. Corporate profits areconsidered a leading indicator, usually rising in advance ofthe economy. So the sharp earnings declines weren't widelyexpected in a period when the economy appeared to be rising.   To be sure, there have been some pleasant surprises inindividual company reports, but Melissa R. Brown, who tracksprofits for Prudential Securities, says the negativesurprises have outnumbered the positive ones by about threeto two.   The overall economy wasn't exactly robust in the secondquarter, but the Commerce Department estimated that realgross national product -- the total value of the nation'soutput of goods and services, adjusted for inflation -- roseat an annual rate of 0.4%, the first upturn since the thirdquarter of last year. The 51 economists interviewed monthlyby Blue Chip Economic Indicators now look for real GNP torise at a 2.7% rate in the current quarter and at a 2.9% pacein the final three months of the year.   This would be an unusually slow recovery; in earlierupturns, the gross national product usually has been climbingat annual rates of more than 5% within two quarters after thebeginning of a recovery. Partly as a result, analysts seeonly slow gains in profits. Mickey D. Levy, chief economistof CRT Government Securities, for instance, expects earningsto rise gradually the rest of this year, &quot;with more momentumin 1992 as increases in production costs continue to recedeand product demand picks up.&quot;   Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist of the investment firmof Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., says the profits recession &quot;appearsto have bottomed out and corporate earnings may be startingto recover.&quot; He thinks this will be a &quot;very mild&quot; profitsrecovery. Since profits are needed to finance businessexpansion, he therefore is convinced that the overallrecovery will be sub-par.   Among industry groups, big banks and major oil companiesreported lower earnings. Auto makers posted losses, while theaerospace and defense sector enjoyed a strong quarter andprofits soared for securities firms.   Red ink kept Detroit mired in the blues in the secondquarter. Although demand for new vehicles improved from thefirst quarter, it was still far from robust in the U.S. andmuch of Europe. General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, however,narrowed their losses from the first quarter, thanks toimproved production and cost-cutting. Many auto parts makerscontinued to struggle, reflecting Detroit's woes.   Auto makers now expect a weak recovery in the second half.Barring a sales surge, profits aren't expected until thefourth quarter at the earliest. Meanwhile, the Big Three andseveral Japanese auto makers will be spending heavily to rollout important new models this fall. GM will launch nine newcars; Ford a modestly redesigned Taurus; Honda will introducea redesigned Civic, and Toyota a larger, sleeker Camry sedan.The new products could help rekindle demand in the U.S.   But as the new models hit showrooms, so will hefty priceincreases. Industry executives are eager to rebuildprofitability, and pass on to consumers the costs of newsafety technology and pollution control features. However,consumers remain wary amid widespread corporate job-slashingand slow income growth. With over-capacity in North America,price boosts may not stick, keeping profits under pressure.   The aerospace and defense group posted mostly higherprofits for the quarter, as the huge write-offs that onceplagued the industry were practically absent, andcost-cutting continued to bolster the bottom line. On anoperating-profit basis, almost all defense contractors showedimproved results.   The drop in GenCorp's earnings reflected a nonrecurringgain in the year-before quarter; Sundstrand's earnings weredragged down by a special charge this year, and Lockheed'sprofit fell largely because of an increase in its effectivetax rate. Grumman defied Wall Street's expectations byposting higher net income instead of a decline, and McDonnellDouglas and Boeing also exceeded projections. Analysts expectthe improved earnings to continue in the third quarter.   &quot;In general, I think most aerospace companies are going todo quite well,&quot; says Peter Aseritis, an analyst with FirstBoston. But Prudential Securities analyst Paul Nisbetcautions that aerospace companies with cyclical commercialexposure could be hurt by the sluggish economy.   In the banking industry, most big companies posted lowerearnings. Except for large West Coast firms, however, banksgenerally managed to report higher profits than analysts hadexpected.   Many banks benefited from wider spreads between the ratesthey pay on deposits and receive on loans despite continuedweakness in loan demand. West Coast banks posted sharplylower profits as loan-loss provisions rose substantially.   &quot;Their performance was set back by major provisions forhighly leveraged transaction and commercial real estateloans,&quot; said James McDermott, president of bank-stockspecialist Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc.   Security Pacific and First Interstate, both based in LosAngeles, more than doubled their provision for loan losses.First Interstate, hurt by bad real estate loans and loans tocasino companies in Nevada and a slowdown in theforest-products industry affecting its Oregon subsidiary,increased its loan-loss provisions to $295 million. SecurityPacific boosted its loan-loss provision to $409.3 million,reflecting rising nonperforming loans.   Meanwhile, money-center banks such as ManufacturersHanover, which agreed to merge with Chemical Banking, andChase Manhattan benefited from wider interest margins andcost-cutting. Although Citicorp doubled its loan-lossprovision, it made progress in cutting expenses and thegrowth of its problem loans slowed sharply from the pace ofrecent quarters.   Higher oil prices weren't enough to offset declines inalmost every line of business for the major oil companies.The recession curbed gasoline demand in the normally heavydriving season. As a result, profit margins were slim. Inaddition, the higher price of crude -- the feedstock forgasoline -- also reduced margins. The recession and anoversupply of many chemicals reduced petrochemical profits.The only bright spot for Big Oil was the price of crude,which averaged around $2 a barrel higher than last year.Natural gas prices were dismal, however.   The outlook isn't much changed for the rest of the year,and most analysts expect the second half of 1991 to be weakerthan in 1990. Natural gas prices are expected to remaindepressed. The chemical market isn't expected to turn aroundquickly. And demand for gasoline still seems relatively weak.Of the major oil companies, only Exxon eked out ayear-to-year increase. Occidental had an $85 million gainfrom the sale of an interest in a Chinese coal mine and a $12million tax gain; a year earlier it had $61 million of gains.   Securities brokers, riding a rebound in thestock-underwriting business, had one of their best quarterssince before the 1987 stock-market crash.   Record results were posted at A.G. Edwards, Merrill Lynchand several other brokers. Though brokerage-commissionrevenues slowed from the first quarter's torrid pace, thatdecline was offset by the underwriting boom. There were alsosurprisingly good earnings from trading -- with MorganStanley Group's in-house trading revenue soaring 61% to$323.7 million.   But analysts already see signs that the brokeragebusiness's profits will tail off during the rest of the year.New York Stock Exchange volume has steadily decreased fromthe first quarter's sky-high levels, and there is still nomergers-and-acquisitions activity to speak of.   &quot;Unfortunately, we've probably seen the best results of1991, and perhaps of the next several years,&quot; said A. MichaelLipper, president of Lipper Analytical Securities Corp. Theboom in the new-issue market, in particular, &quot;is showing itsage.&quot;   Here are the second-quarter profits for various industrygroups and comparisons with the year-earlier quarter.

Steelmakers struggled in the appliance, automotiveand construction markets, where recessionary demand droppedshipments and prices. They also were hurt by start-up andmodernization costs, and complained of higher labor expenses.USX's U.S. Steel unit still hasn't regained all the customersit lost in the first quarter when it appeared it might face astrike. Steel processors and finishers with higher-marginproducts, companies such as Worthington Industries, managedmodest profits.   While orders have accelerated in the third quarter andprice increases could help producers by the fall, most bigsteelmakers won't see a profit before the fourth quarter.Bethlehem Steel has already said it expects a third-quarterloss.   All aluminum makers suffered from lower prices in thequarter, but steady shipments allowed most to report modestprofits. The third quarter threatens to look much the samefor the glutted industry, though higher demand is expected tolift prices and profits by the fourth quarter. ReynoldsMetals, which emphasizes its fabricated aluminum andpackaging goods, fared better than competitors. Largeinterest expenses hurt profit at Maxxam's Kaiser Aluminum.   Mining company earnings fell because of lower copper,gold, silver, zinc and lead prices. In addition, many coppercompanies continued to see lower productivity and highercosts in the second quarter from weather-related problemsthat started in the first quarter.   Production at many gold mining companies, includingNewmont Mining, declined slightly, reducing earnings.   Homestake Mining's loss reflected write-downs totalingabout $67.7 million on various mining and explorationproperties. The company's gold operations reported lowerearnings because of reduced sales volumes and higher costs ofproduction.   Forest-product companies benefited somewhat from risinglumber and plywood prices, but pulp and paper prices sagged.   Concern over access to timber in the Pacific Northwestcaused by a court ruling affecting the threatened spotted owlbriefly pushed prices to record highs in June. Heavy springrains also hindered logging in the South. Louisiana-Pacificearnings, for example, reflected higher lumber prices, andfell less than most companies.   Excess pulp and paper production capacity and weak demandcut overall profits roughly in half compared with 1990.   The market price for wood pulp fell to about $525 a ton,compared with the $840 peak in 1989. Georgia-Pacific andWeyerhaeuser, along with most forest-product companies, werehurt by lower pulp prices. Sherman Chao, an analyst withSalomon Brothers Inc., expects the glut to cause temporarymill closures before the end of the year. The next twoquarters are likely to be unchanged overall, he said, withgrowth of 10% to 15% in 1992. Historically, forest-productcompanies have enjoyed 25%-30% growth after a recession year.   Over-capacity in the commodity chemical and plasticbusinesses, and the U.S. recession, continued to weighheavily on chemical company results. But the worst is nearlybehind the highly cyclical industry, according to securitiesanalysts. They expect the companies to show strong earningsgains by this year's fourth quarter or early in 1992 aseconomic recovery in the U.S. boosts demand from the auto andhousing industries.   &quot;We have seen signs of a pickup in synthetic fibers andplastics, the sectors that usually lead the chemicalindustry's upturn,&quot; says Anantha Raman, an analyst who headshis own research firm.   Exceptions to the chemical industry downturn last quarterthat showed earnings gains, such as American Cyanamid and AirProducts andamp; Chemicals, derive much of their profits fromspeciality chemicals, demand for which is more immune toeconomic ups and downs. To boost its profitability in comingquarters, Monsanto took an after-tax charge of $325 millionto cover restructuring and cost-cutting expenses.

Schlumberger said world-wide rig activity fell 7% in thequarter but it and other companies had growth in the EasternHemisphere and Latin America. Most service companies continueto focus more overseas, where activity is more stable and isactually growing in some areas. In the U.S., drillingactivity plunged because of the depressed natural gas market.With the long shakeout in the oil field service industry, thesurviving companies can better survive a downturn in drillingactivity. The pattern of weak U.S. drilling with stableoverseas activity has continued into the current quarter.   Earnings for natural gas pipeline companies generally fellbecause of record low prices, a surplus still building indomestic storage facilities and continued sluggishness in theeconomy.   Burlington Resources said that like many in the industry,it minimized its earnings decline by increasing production;the company said it sold more gas than in the year-beforequarter despite the weak market and it's continuing acost-reduction strategy of adding minimal new employees topump additional volume. Panhandle's loss narrowed from theyear earlier partly because two of its four major pipelinesmanaged to post operating profit; the company's overalloperating income rose 3.3% from the year before.   Natural gas customers continued to replenish supplies, butthey did so in minimal volume because warm weather lastwinter allowed them to burn so little fuel. Some gasproducers temporarily closed down production of some wells,hoping to sell later at higher prices. &quot;But an end to the gassurplus and the accompanying low price just isn't in sight,&quot;said Vinod Dar, a gas industry consultant.   ---   OIL                                                                                                          -- INTEGRATED OILS                                                                                                                                    2nd Qtr.    2nd Qtr.      %   9 Firms                     1991        1990       Chg                                                                                                          Amoco Corp                238,000     379,000     - 37   Atlantic Richfield        246,000     391,000     - 37   Chevron Corp              384,000     648,000     - 41   Exxon Corp              1,125,000   1,100,000     +  2   Mobil Corp                445,000     498,000     - 11   Phillips Petroleum         16,000     105,000     - 85   Sun Co                     43,000     115,000     - 63   Texaco Inc                269,000     353,000     - 24   Unocal Corp                 5,000     165,000     - 97   TOTAL                   2,771,000   3,754,000     - 26                                                                                                          -- SECONDARY OILS                                                                                                                                    2nd Qtr.    2nd Qtr.      %   17 Firms                    1991        1990       Chg                                                                                                          Amerada Hess               67,700     -72,100      ...

Conrail said tight costcontrols helped it weather a traffic drop.   Analysts expect rail freight volumes and earnings tostrengthen gradually during the rest of the year.   Trucking-company earnings reflected lower freight volumes,intense competition and continued rate discounting. However,analysts noted signs that freight volume has begun toimprove.   Big air-freight companies had a sluggish quarter, as theyrelied more on low-yielding services to weather therecession. Federal Express had continuing overseas losses andtook write-downs on airplanes that have lost value since thecompany ordered them. The company's expanded next-afternoonservice continued to replace lost volume from the moreexpensive next-morning service, and total volume increased.   Airborne Freight's domestic shipment volume increased 24%for the second quarter, as the company marketed its newsecond-day service aggressively. But that didn't match lastyear's record growth of 37%. Harper Group's air-freightforwarding business slowed after the war in Iraq ended, butthe company was able to reduce costs to compensate. AnalystGeorge Morris of Prescott, Ball andamp; Turben in Cleveland expectsno significant pickup in volume for the industry until thefall. He predicts Airborne's earnings in the current quarterwill be flat, while Federal's will be off 20%.   Among marine transportation companies, American Presidentbenefited from cost-cutting, increased freight and U.S.export gains, including cargo carried in connection withOperation Desert Storm.   The slump in heavy truck sales continued to depressresults in the transportation equipment industry, thoughcost-cutting kept the quarter from being as dismal as thefirst three months of the year. Some companies saw signs ofrecovery. Paccar cited a &quot;gradual increase in business&quot; fromthe first quarter, and said order backlogs increased. CumminsEngine saw an increase in sales of its midrange engines andgenerators, but saw no sign of improvement in the heavy-dutytruck market. It expects another loss in the traditionallyweaker third quarter.   For heavy machinery companies, the slide inconstruction-equipment sales once again clipped results,especially in the U.S. Caterpillar, the biggest maker of suchequipment, saw a 22% decline in domestic sales. Its salesoutside the country rose 3% from a year earlier. Deere mademoney in farm equipment, but lost money in its division thatmakes construction equipment. Caterpillar and Clark Equipment see losses for the full year, as the sales and profitslumps are expected to continue.   In the electrical component industry, Westinghouse saidall its businesses -- power and electronic systems,industrial products, broadcasting and financial services --turned in disappointing results. Its operating profit marginwas down to 7.9% from 11.5% in the 1990 quarter.   Honeywell suffered from pressure on profit margins for itsbuilding-controls segment, where both commercial andresidential markets have softened, and in the industrialcomponents segment. Also, year-earlier results were buoyed byan unusually low effective tax rate and by earnings fromdiscontinued operations.

But the quarterly salessurpassed those of the previous quarter, when consumerconfidence was at a low ebb because of the economy anduncertainty over the Persian Gulf War.   Centex, which builds in Texas and California among otherstates, said earnings were up 37% in the fiscal 1992 firstquarter vs. the fourth quarter, although profits were down65% from the year-earlier first quarter. David Quinn,executive vice president and chief financial officer ofCentex, said the strong first-quarter performance shouldboost earnings for the second and third quarters, although hedeclined to give specific projections.   Kaufman andamp; Broad, which is heavily concentrated in theCalifornia market, said its second-quarter sales were downslightly from a year earlier, but spokeswoman Eileen Rosenoted that 1990 was a record sales year for the company.While Ms. Rose, too, declined to state projections forensuing quarters, she noted that the builder is sufferingfrom a mysterious sales malaise that set in during June andshows no sign of going away. &quot;We're right back to a crisis ofconfidence on the part of consumers concerning the outlookfor the economy, and their own outlook,&quot; she said.   Retailers are expected to post mixed results for thesecond quarter, which ended in July for most chains. Theperiod started strong with unusually warm weather in theeastern half of the U.S. spurring sales of summer apparel andother seasonal goods. But weakness followed in June and July.The big California market also remained mired in a slump.   Sears Roebuck, which operates on a calendar year, reporteda slight rise in net income after a charge for certain taxpayments; but the struggling Sears merchandise groupbenefited from its massive cost-cutting drive, posting a 43%profit jump despite a decline in sales.   Earnings gains are expected for Dillard Department Stores,Nordstrom, Wal-Mart, Kmart, Gap and Charming Shoppes. Butplunging profits will probably be posted by J.C. Penney,Dayton Hudson and Woolworth. At May Department Stores,earnings may have dropped slightly. And Limited, which isdiscounting aggressively to draw shoppers to its flagshipLimited stores, is expected to show earnings equal to lastyear's.   Lodging and casino companies reported mixed results, withmost showing little direct benefit from a slight upturn intravel and tourism.   Hilton Hotels' sharp decline stemmed fromrecession-related pressures on business and vacation travel,while Marriott continued to suffer from problems in the realestate market. Some big casino companies, such as CircusCircus Enterprises and Promus, showed healthy operatingearnings despite the soft vacation market. More typically,Aztar's operating results reflected continued competitivepressures, while Caesars World attributed most of itsyear-to-year improvement to a lucky streak at the gamblingtables.   Operators expect no sharp improvement in businessconditions during the current quarter, typically one of thestrongest for travel and tourism. &quot;The second half of 1991will be a difficult period for Hilton and the lodgingindustry,&quot; Barron Hilton, Hilton Hotels' chairman, toldinvestors.   Amid continued recessionary pressures, the restaurantindustry was mired in price wars in the second quarter.Discounting boosted domestic sales and traffic at McDonald'sand PepsiCo's Taco Bell. But the competition hurt PepsiCo'sKentucky Fried Chicken unit, which hasn't fully embracedlower prices. Shoney's earnings were aided by decreasedinterest costs and controlled operating expenses, butsame-store sales were flat.   Overseas, McDonald's and KFC posted double-digit salesgains and profit margins as the two chains continued toexpand in underdeveloped markets. TCBY profit plunged assame-store sales fell 10%. Joseph Doyle with Smith Barneyforecasts a 7% increase in third-quarter earnings forMcDonald's as lower prices continue to bolster sales andtraffic.   Recession-weary consumers continued to slow their buyingof theme park tickets and compact discs, hurting Disney andTime Warner, respectively. A weak advertising environmentwounded Time Warner's publishing division, but King World'stelevision shows bucked the trend and earnings grew.   All the entertainment companies were hurt by poor movieattendance. And Polaroid had a lackluster quarter in themidst of a new marketing strategy of selling instant camerasat &quot;near-break-even,&quot; says analyst David S. Nelson ofShearson Lehman Hutton, hoping that more profitable filmsales will follow.   The boat-building business continued to suffer salesdeclines. &quot;It's the worst downturn in the post-war period,&quot;says Jerry P. Melin of Rothschild Inc., &quot;with no signs of animminent upturn.&quot; Companies have been downsizing to try toadapt.   In the media sector, the broadcast television networkssuffered from continued weakness in the advertising market.Both Capital Cities/ABC and CBS were also hurt by costsstemming from covering the Persian Gulf War and its aftermath. At CBS, operating earnings declined at its TV network,and profits fell at the five TV stations it owns. CapitalCities/ABC was battered not only at its broadcastingoperations but also at its publishing division because of theweakness in advertising.   The recession's effect on newspaper advertising continued,producing expected poor results at all major newspaperpublishing companies. Washington Post, New York Times andTimes Mirror were down heavily, largely because of thecontinued poor performance of their East Coast metropolitandailies. Dow Jones, Gannett and Tribune had less significantdeclines. There were some signs that the advertisingrecession had reached its bottom and that earnings may soonstart improving.   A lingering slowdown in traffic from the recession and theGulf War hurt airlines' results. Earnings dwindled furtherbecause some carriers responded to the traffic slowdown withone of the easiest weapons available to them: fare cuts.Others matched the cuts, for competitive reasons. And duringthe quarter, many travelers flew on tickets purchased duringa half-price sale started by America West Airlines earlier inthe year.

Sales of ready-to-eat cereal again fueled GeneralMills' packaged-foods profits while the company's sit-downrestaurant chains recovered from earlier declines in trafficcounts. Cereal rival Kellogg continued its domestic salesrebound.   Heinz capitalized on strengthening foreign currencies plusprice and volume increases to boost earnings, while Castle andamp;Cooke cited strong demand and improved prices for bananas andfresh vegetables. Gains from restructuring combined withbetter U.S. soup sales at Campbell, and last summer'sacquisition of Beatrice Co. lifted ConAgra's bottom line to arecord.   Pasta and puddings helped Hershey, where quarterlyoperating results exceeded 1990's; last year's figuresinclude a $35.3 million gain from the sale of a Swedishconfectioner. Going against the industry trend, RalstonPurina's earnings declined as pet-food sales slumped. Thecompany also took restructuring charges.   Food retailers continued to experience sluggish salesgrowth in the quarter, as supermarket chains focused onrecession-conscious consumers' tendency to eat at home moreoften. In areas where economic conditions are among thebleakest -- New England, the Eastern seaboard and nowSouthern California -- the recession took a big bite out offood retailers' bottom lines.   At almost all the big chains, same-store-sales growth isslower, say analysts, who predict more of the same for thecurrent quarter. &quot;Food retailing is more sensitive {to aneconomic slowdown} than people think,&quot; Thomas R. Kully, foodretailing analyst with William Blair, says. &quot;It's notrecession-proof.&quot; Although supermarkets benefit from theslump in restaurant dining, they are nicked by otherrecessionary habits -- such as grocery shoppers &quot;tradingdown&quot; in the aisles, buying cheaper, private-label and morecanned goods. Even at the usually thriving Albertson's,same-store-sales rose only about 2%.   A further drop in the rate of food-price inflation --slipping to a range of 1.5% to 2% in the quarter -- iscutting into grocery chains' margins, too. &quot;The price of milkis down, the price of processed vegetables is down,&quot; Clare W.Zempel, analyst with Robert W. Baird, notes. &quot;And that leadsto fairly modest increases in sales.&quot;   Major beverage companies reported mostly higher earnings,but as the important summer selling season opened, volumegrowth was restrained by price increases and the recession.   Strong sales overseas fueled Coca-Cola's earnings, helpingto offset a sluggish domestic soda market. U.S. soft-drinkvolume increased an anemic 1% or so in the quarter, off fromthe 3% to 4% growth of previous years. With volume flat,Pepsi's soft-drink profit growth came from higher concentrateprices. Amid price-cutting by competitors, lower profits atKentucky Fried Chicken and Frito-Lay were a drag on Pepsi'searnings. Coca-Cola Enterprises reported anotherdisappointing quarter, with weak volume and only a minimalprice increase.   The higher federal excise tax on beer, combined withbrewers' price increases, hurt beer industry volume. Whilebenefiting from market-share gains, Anheuser-Busch's sales towholesalers slipped 0.37% in the quarter. Coors experiencedproduction problems at its brewery in Golden, Colo.   In the third quarter, Roy Burry, at Kidder Peabody,expects per-share earnings gains of 21% for Coca-Cola, 15%for Pepsi and 12% for Anheuser-Busch.   Medical supply companies and health care providerscontinued a long string of double-digit earnings increases,reflecting the strength of the health care industry no matterthe shape of the economy. Analysts expect more of the same.   C.R. Bard's jump in profit reflected year-earlierregulatory problems with its cardiovascular business.&quot;They've stanched the hemorrhaging,&quot; says Kurt Kruger,analyst at Hambrecht andamp; Quist, and more healthy comparisonsare ahead for 1991. Baxter continued to benefit from a majorrestructuring last year.   At Humana, an 82% increase in operating profit in itshealth plans fueled the overall earnings rise. NationalMedical Enterprises' profit growth was damped by a charge,but operations were strong in all major areas -- acute,psychiatric and rehabilitation -- says John Hindelong,analyst at Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. Industrywide,psychiatric revenues remain under pressure from corporatemanaged care programs that are reducing lengths of stay, butthe impact is mostly offset by increased admissions, he says.Strong growth in rehabilitation services is expected.

IBM'searnings plunge reflected a $200 million charge to coveradditional work-force reductions. Digital Equipment took a$1.1 billion charge, which securities analysts said shouldcover employment reductions of at least 10,000 people. Unisyshad a $1.2 billion charge and said it would cut 10,000 jobs,on top of the thousands it has already eliminated. Evenstalwarts Apple Computer and Compaq Computer had problems,because of the withering price war in the personal-computerindustry; Apple reported a loss because of a $138.9 millioncharge to cover layoffs and consolidation of facilities.   This quarter doesn't look much better. The problems in thepersonal-computer industry will probably continue untilmanufacturers can lower expenses enough to catch up withdeclining prices. A new generation of mainframes will startto become available toward the end of this quarter, whichcould resuscitate demand, but they won't be available in bigvolumes until the fourth quarter.   Economic doldrums continued to dog the semiconductorindustry, but a few wildly popular chips helped brighten someplayers' earnings.   Chip-making-equipment concerns such as Applied Materialswere hit as customers cut back on capital-equipmentpurchases. Analog Devices, which makes more than half of itsrevenue overseas, was hurt by the rising dollar but stillposted higher earnings. Intel, meanwhile, profited handsomelyfrom its microprocessor chips, which show no signs of waningin popularity among personal-computer makers. Advanced Micro,despite falling profit margins in its older chip lines,benefited from its new, hot-selling &quot;clones&quot; of Intel'smicroprocessors.   Chip makers generally expect business to pick up a bitafter a seasonal summer slowdown, but they don't see biggrowth until 1992.   The software industry continues to be sharply dividedbetween companies that are growing rapidly and those that arenot. Count among the highfliers Microsoft, Novell, BorlandInternational and Adobe Systems. High double-digit growth inearnings at those companies is driven by popular new productsand leadership in such key categories as operating systems,networking and tools. In contrast, Oracle, Autodesk,Ashton-Tate and Lotus Development, all of which were oncepart of the hyper-growth parade, are searching for ways toregain profit growth.   Ashton-Tate tentatively agreed recently to a friendlytakeover by Borland, while Autodesk reorganized its executiveranks in the hopes of rediscovering its entreprenurial zeal.Lotus should benefit in the second half of the year from along-awaited Windows version of its 1-2-3 spreadsheet.Oracle, meanwhile, is still shaking off a major restructuringand a downturn in its core data base business.   In the communications sector, ATandamp;T saw a strong surge insecond-quarter earnings after selling most of its share ofSun Microsystems and posting robust growth across its majorlines, including long-distance service, publictelecommunications equipment and financial services. Butprofit could drop significantly in the second half when ATandamp;Ttakes charges of as much as $4 billion to help pay for itsacquisition of NCR Corp. and a restructuring of its officephone equipment business.   Motorola's results plunged, despite a strong showing inits computer chip business. Recession hurt its paging equipment business, and the company's general systems sector,including cellular phones, showed a lower operating profit.   Among diversified technology companies, UnitedTechnologies took a $148 million pretax charge forcontract-related adjustments, which was anticipated. Further,the weak economy hurt all its major businesses, which servethe commercial aviation, building, industrial and automotivemarkets. It has said it will continue efforts to cut costs.   TRW took an after-tax charge of $18 million on the sale oftwo European automotive businesses. Minnesota Mining andamp;Manufacturing, with its wide range of products used invarious industries, clearly suffered from a weak economy. Italso said the stronger dollar continues to hurt translationof its overseas profits. Texas Instruments had a $130 millionpretax charge for reducing its work force by 3,200, but italso has a dim outlook for the third quarter, with increasingdemand for its computers offset by higher investment costs.Tektronix said its year-earlier results included a $67.8million restructuring charge.   In the biotechnology sector, Amgen's loss reflects anafter-tax charge of $88.5 million because of a damagesettlement awarded to Johnson andamp; Johnson. However, sales ofits gene-spliced products are expected to return the companyto profitability soon, with an estimated $40 million to $45million in profit in the Sept. 30 quarter. The expectedlaunch of another new product should also aid profitability.   Among medical and surgical equipment companies, St. Judeand Stryker Corp. are expected to post continued profitgrowth due to more patients requiring surgical procedures.St. Jude looks for profit of $19 million to $22 million inthe current quarter, due to the rise in patients needingartificial heart valves, and the number of hospitalsqualified to do open-heart surgery.

The company noted thatexcluding the charge, net would have risen 5.5%. GTE saidrevenue from long-distance phone carriers was down, butoperating income rose 3.4%.   Centel's earnings soared mostly because of a $45.6 millionnet gain from the exchange of its Minnesota telephoneoperations with Rochester Telephone. Without the gain, Centelwould have reported a 33% drop in net. Southwestern Bellattributed its profit decline in part to an $80.7 millioncharge for the refinancing of long-term debt. The companysaid earn ings were also affected by a Federal CommunicationsCommission decision that reduced charges for connecting callsto long-distance carriers and by rate reductions included ina Texas regulatory agreement that took affect late last year.   There was very little eye-popping news on electricutilities during the second quarter. Earnings for theindustry as a whole were basically flat, but in line withsecurities analysts' expectations. &quot;The industry has beenrelatively quiet,&quot; says Daniel Scotto, a utilities analyst atDonaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette in New York. &quot;That's what hasmade it so attractive. Investors have been flocking toutilities.&quot;   Warm weather in May and June contributed to a slight risein kilowatt sales for many electric utilities, particularlyon the East and West coasts. And efforts to reduce debt paidoff for many companies in terms of lower interest payments,Mr. Scotto says.
