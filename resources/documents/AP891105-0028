Ivan D. Yershov recounted how people screamed``occupiers'' at the Soviet troops he led into Czechoslovakia in1968 to crush the effort to liberalize that nation's communistregime.   ``We were told that we were going in at the request of theCzechoslovakian leadership, to protect socialism, becausecounter-revolutionaries were preparing to take over. And it was notexcluded that the West would intervene,'' Yershov said.   Yershov said he was shocked when his troops were not greeted asheroes.   ``I had doubts on the morning of Aug. 21, when I saw that theCzech people were unhappy that we had come,'' said Yershov. ``Theyscreamed at us, `You are occupiers.'''   Eleven years later the Soviet invasion of Afghanistanintensified those doubts.   His faith in the communist system broke entirely when hisdaughter went on a hunger strike in 1982 to win permission to joinher husband and daughter in the United States.   That was a different time, before Mikhail Gorbachev, beforeperestroika. Regimes at least as liberal as the one Yershov helpedremove in Prague are springing up all over Eastern Europe, indeed,in Moscow itself.   The retired general's son-in-law now travels freely betweenWashington and Moscow where he is trying to establish an AmericanUniversity.   But only seven years ago, when Yershov won permission for hisdaughter, Tatyana Lozansky, to leave the Soviet Union, the fightcost him his privileged post as a three-star general.   Now on his first visit to America, staying in Washington withhis daughter and son-in-law, Yershov told The Associated Press thathe believes more than ever that he was right to question the Sovietregime.   And he says many former colleagues in the Soviet Armed Forcessupport Gorbachev's efforts to reform their country, even if itmeans a smaller role for the military.   Yershov's assessment _ while by no means conclusive _ was incontrast to the dour view of human rights activist Andrei D.Sakharov who has warned of a potential military coup.   ``The Army supports Gorbachev. Most of the officers and mensupport perestroika. The Army takes orders,'' as it did inCzechoslovakia and Afghanistan, Yershov said. But the line ofcommand is changing.   ``Now the army is taking orders from the Supreme Soviet,'' theparliament that is assuming greater power.   ``Before, the Army was taking orders from the Politburo,'' thebody of a dozen or so top communists that has run the Soviet Unionfor most of its 72 years.   ``The Afghan invasion was decided on the Politburo level, two orthree people. Such decisions will not be made again by a smallgroup,'' he said. ``Gorbachev was right to withdraw fromAfghanistan.''   Yershov does not believe the Soviet military would object towithdrawal from Eastern Europe or a diminished role for the WarsawPact if U.S. forces also withdrew from Europe.   ``The countries of Eastern Europe should decide whether Soviettroops should be on their territory. They should decide whether tobe members of the Warsaw Pact,'' he said. ``I know that manygenerals feel the same way.''   If Yershov's life has taken some unusual turns, it was for manyyears typical for his generation. He came out of World War II as alieutenant colonel in the Soviet Army.   He rose to two-star general by 1968, and on Aug. 20 of thatyear, was deputy commander of the Soviet forces that invadedCzechoslovakia.   While Yershov and others were surprised by the hostilereception, they kept their feelings to themselves.   ``Among ourselves, we said that it was the right-wingextremists, the counter-revolutionaries, who had made thisnecessary,'' said Yershov. ``We never expressed doubts amongourselves.''   When Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan 11 years later, thedoubts grew.   ``I met with many of my comrades who said it was a bigmistake,'' said Yershov.   Jeopardizing Soviet lives and prestige to support an unpopulargovernment was unwise, he said.   ``Only a small part of the Afghan people supported therevolution,'' he said.   ``I wouldn't have said all this 10 years ago, because I had abig family that I had to support and protect,'' he said.   Family became politics for Yershov in 1982, when his daughterTatyana began a highly publicized hunger strike to join her husbandand daughter in the United States.   Tatyana married Edward Lozansky, a physicist, in 1972. Lozansky,a dissident, emigrated with their daughter, now 17.   Yershov opposed Edward Lozansky's departure, and asked him notto go. At first, he refused to sign papers to allow Tatyana tofollow.   Then Tatyana began a hunger strike, and Yershov realized ``itwas her right to come here, to join her husband and child.''   Yershov's view of the United States changed when he arrived tovisit his daughter, now a U.S. citizen, and his granddaughter, nowa freshman at Brown University.   Among his impressions, said Yershov, ``the most important is thesharp contrast in the lives of the people of the United States andthe U.S.S.R.''   ``We have shortages of goods, long lines in stores, and poorservices,'' he said. ``Here, everything is the opposite. Everythingis done for the people. That is the most important difference.''</TEXT></DOC>
