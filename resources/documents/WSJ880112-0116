Perhaps this is so, but it also would mean that banks would have to accept the additional risks associated with underwriting securities.    Money-center banks have demonstrated little ability to manage the risks they already have taken. Decisions to reduce current and future earnings by billions of dollars to cover bad Third World loans come at the expense of the shareholders. Having failed to manage loan portfolios, bank managements are making up for it by reducing their work forces by thousands of jobs. So, the employees pay. Despite recent claims to the contrary, the government eventually will have to bail the banks out at the expense of the American taxpayer. Any loan write-downs will, of course, reduce taxes paid by the banks.    I am not convinced that banking expertise matched with securities underwriting would produce cheaper underwriting costs. The most likely way banks would gain access is by acquiring existing underwriting firms, many of which also are experiencing serious management problems. This would not be a costless endeavor and, in fact, could further dilute bank earnings.    What is needed is more managerial efficiency on the part of the money-center banks, not the assumption of more risk through securities underwriting in the name of market efficiency.    Prof. Robert H. Trent   McIntire School of Commerce   University of Virginia   Charlottesville, Va.   ---   In the current debate over the reform of the Glass-Steagall Act, there appears to be very little discussion of the original rationale for the rule restricting commercial banks from engaging in investment banking. The intent of the rule was to uphold the common law presumption in favor of &quot;arm's length transactions&quot; in order to strengthen the integrity of the market process. Apparently banks that owned investment-banking subsidiaries often were tempted to purchase more than a fair share of the affiliates' issues for their trust departments, to recommend such issues to their own depositor/clients, to turn over lists of major depositors to the affiliate's sales department, and possibly to recommend to slow borrowers that they fund their debt by having the investment banking subsidiary float an issue for them.    Of course we could prevent the parties from succumbing to these temptations by enlarging the regulatory functions of the Securities and Exchange Commission. But perhaps we should not encourage the cohabitation of supply and demand. Maybe it would be better to leave the current system alone.
