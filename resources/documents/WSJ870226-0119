WinterStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> HUFDOW JONES INTERVIEW (CEO) </IN><DATELINE> DAYTON, Ohio  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Huffy Corp., after three years of severe battering by foreign bicycle makers and by currency fluctuations, is faring better these days.    Huffy makes more than half the bikes produced in the U.S., putting the company in position to benefit from the sharp rise in the value of key foreign currencies against the dollar.    &quot;We have created a world-competitive bike plant at Celina, Ohio,&quot; says Harry A. Shaw III, chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;And we have been generating about $7 million a year in cost reduction in our bicycle operations, but the savings have been eroded away by bicycle price reductions. This year we hope to bring more of that saving to the bottom line.&quot;    Huffy's fourth-quarter net income was between $1.2 million and $1.4 million, or 22 cents to 25 cents a share, Mr. Shaw estimates. Full-year profit was between $5.7 million and $5.9 million, or $1.05 to $1.08 a share, he says.    In the 1985 fourth quarter, Huffy had a net loss of $373,000. In all of 1985, the company earned only $245,000 because a charge of $2.3 million, or 43 cents a share, for discontinuance of a physical-fitness product line offset most of the modest profit from the bicycle business.    Because of strong Christmas business, 1986 fourth-quarter sales jumped more than 20% to between $63 million and $64 million from $52.5 million in the 1985 final period, Mr. Shaw says. Full-year 1986 sales were about $295 million, up from $264.9 million in 1985.    Some analysts are predicting that Huffy will earn $1.45 a share in 1987. Mr. Shaw says the company &quot;would have to work like hell to get there,&quot; but he says it isn't impossible if things break right.    Taiwan-made bikes, Huffy's toughest competition in recent years, by June will cost retailers 10% more than a year earlier, Huffy officials say. The Taiwan dollar is about 12% higher than at the start of 1986, and Huffy executives expect it to rise another 8% during the next six months.    Because of the rise in prices of Taiwan-made bikes, the company was able to raise prices by 3% to 6% on Huffy bikes, effective in the 1987 second quarter, the first such price increase in about five years. By contrast, Huffy was forced to slash prices by 20% between 1982 and 1985 to meet lower-priced foreign competition.    The company stepped up automation efforts at Celina and chopped overhead costs. The cost of making Huffy bicycles has been cut by about 14% since 1982, Mr. Shaw says.    In spite of cost-cutting by domestic producers, however, imports last year grabbed 57%, or about seven million, of the 12.3 million bikes sold in the U.S., up from 24% in 1982.    Ironically, the initial drop in the value of the dollar hurt Huffy more than it helped. The higher yen resulted in a 20% to 25% rise in the price of parts Huffy bought from Japan last year. And by year's end, the company started to get demands for price increases of 12% to 15% for parts from Taiwan, too.    Huffy last year was able to raise prices modestly on its Raleigh bikes, which are sold through bike shops, but not fast enough to keep up with the soaring prices of Japanese parts. And prices were flat for the big-volume Huffy bikes, which are sold through mass merchandisers.    Huffy's price increases will offset some of the higher parts costs, allowing the company to retain some of the expected gains in efficiency, Mr. Shaw say. Also, Huffy has begun finding suppliers in Taiwan, Korea and Singapore to replace more costly Japanese parts.    Raleigh will about break even this year, Mr. Shaw says. He had hoped to accomplish that in 1986, but wound up with a pre-tax loss of about $2 million because of the rapid increase in Japanese parts prices. About 75% of Raleigh bikes are made in Taiwan and the rest in a new plant at Kent, Wash. All use some Japanese parts.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Huffy shares rose $1.125 to close at $19.125. </TEXT></DOC>
