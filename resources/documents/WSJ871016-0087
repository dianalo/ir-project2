Frederick S. Hammer, Meritor chairman and chief executive officer, said the thrift holding company plans a major restructuring that calls for the sale of about $1 billion in assets, including the possible divestiture of most of its retail branches outside Philadelphia and some of its mortgage-banking operations.    Including the write-down, Meritor had an operating loss of $366.4 million in the third quarter. A charge of $13.2 million relating to reversal of a tax-loss carry-forward made Meritor's net loss $379.6 million.    In the year-earlier quarter, Meritor had an operating loss of $1.7 million. However, a tax credit of $9.6 million made net $7.9 million, or 22 cents a share.    The loss at Meritor, which has $19.6 billion in assets, is believed to be the second-largest ever by a thrift holding concern. Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of America sustained the largest ever when it reported a $521.1 million loss in the 1984 fourth quarter.    The massive loss received mixed reviews from analysts. &quot;We expected a large loss, but this is a lot worse than what we expected,&quot; said Joseph A. Jolson of San Francisco-based Montgomery Securities.    &quot;It lowers their net worth (assets minus liabilities) quite a bit, and they don't have much net worth,&quot; he said. &quot;The company really can't afford that.&quot;    But W. Talbot Dailey, director of equity research at Baltimore-based Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., said his outlook for Meritor is &quot;optimistic.&quot; He said the write-down will increase Meritor's profits long-term, because the company won't have to amortize as much good will.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Meritor stock fell 37.5 cents to close at $8.375.    Meritor acquired Western Savings, an ailing Philadelphia-based thrift, in 1982 with assistance from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. Under terms of the transaction, the FDIC agreed to compensate Meritor for costs relating to Western Savings when overall company expenses exceeded an industry average.    However, Meritor didn't expect economic conditions to be such that it would have to pay the FDIC when company expenditures were less than those of the industry's, which has been the case since 1985. Directors voted yesterday to terminate the 10-year agreement with the FDIC, resulting in the write-down of good will.    &quot;The agreement was supposed to help hedge us against Western Savings' problems,&quot; said Pamela Richards, Meritor's controller. &quot;Instead, it ended up costing us money.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
