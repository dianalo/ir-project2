Orrin Hatch says if the federalgovernment can give money to residents of Pacific islands affectedby atomic testing, there's no good reason not to do the same forresidents of western states.   Hatch and Rep. Wayne Owens, both of Utah, called Wednesday for aHouse panel to set up a $100 million trust fund for what Owenscalled the nation's ``forgotten guinea pigs'' in the development ofnuclear weapons.   The Republican senator and Democratic congressman have teamed upon similar measures before but have never been able to getlegislation out of committee.   They are more optimistic this year, pointing out Congresscreated a special fund for Japanese people who were locked in U.S.camps during World War II and also voted assistance for veteransexposed to atomic radiation while on duty.   Several civilians exposed to fallout from the Nevada Test Siteduring the 1950s have won judgments in federal courts only to havethem overturned on appeal because of a federal law that generallyshields the government from lawsuits.   The House Judiciary subcommittee on administrative law andgovernment relations is considering broader legislation that wouldexpand the right to sue the federal government if negligence can beproved.   But there was no indication how soon the panel will act on thator the one-purpose, Hatch-Owens bill.   Hatch said the Senate made history in 1985 by acknowledging inits approval of the Marshall Island Compact that atomic testingfallout damaged the health of Pacific islanders and by authorizingpayments for the residents.   Hatch said he fell eight votes short at the time of winningsimilar treatment for residents of the United States.   Called ``downwinders,'' the people exposed to fallout from openair nuclear testing in Nevada in the 1950s live mainly in southernNevada, southern Utah and northwestern Arizona.   Hatch said the trust fund he is proposing would ``amount to onlya fraction of what the downwinders and miners have spent because ofthe problems that the government has caused.''   He said the cases of those who mined uranium in Colorado, NewMexico, Arizona and Utah from 1947 to 1961 may be even moreappalling.   ``Even though the government had adequate warning of the hazardsinvolved, these miners, most of whom were native Americans, weresent into inadequately ventilated mines with virtually noinstruction regarding the dangers of ionizing radiation,'' he said.   Owens called the mining and testing as ``an unnoticed part ofthis nation's nuclear Cold War with the Soviets.''   ``The residents of this region were used as `guinea pigs' in adeadly experiment,'' he said.   He noted a House subcommittee concluded a decade ago``sufficient evidence exists for the federal government to acceptat least compassionate responsibility.''   ``Then, after wringing its hands over the suffering of theseforgotten guinea pigs, Congress unfortunately forgot again,'' saidOwens, who said his brother-in-law, a former uranium miner,recently died of lung cancer.   Assistant Attorney General Stuart M. Gerson, head of the JusticeDepartment's civil division, said the administration opposes thelegislation ``because it would dramatically change current law bymaking the United States subject to unprecedented liability forimplementing policy decisions and functions.''</TEXT></DOC>
