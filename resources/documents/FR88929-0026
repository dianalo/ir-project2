Background</ITAG>The DoD FAR Supplement is codified in Chapter 2, Title 48 of the Code ofFederal Regulations.The October 1, 1987 revision of the CFR is the most recent edition of thattitle. It reflects amendments to the 1986 edition of the DoD FAR Supplementmade by Defense Acquisition Circulars 86-1 through 86-5.Interested parties may submit proposed revisions to this Supplement directlyto the DAR Council.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Public Comments</ITAG>Notices of proposed rules were published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> requesting Government agencies, private firms,associations, and the general public to submit comments to be consideredin the formulation of the final rules.DAC 86-9, Items I, IV, and VI through XPublic comments were not solicited with respect to these revisions sincesuch revisions do not alter the substantive meaning of any coverage inthe DFARS having a significant impact on contractors or offerors, or donot have a significant effect beyond agency internal operating procedures;or compelling reasons required issuance of an interim rule without priorpublication for public comment. However, comments from small entities concerningthe affected DoD FAR Supplement coverage will be considered. Please citeDAR Case 88-610D.DAC 86-9, Item IIAn interim rule was published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on April 16, 1987 (52 FR 12386) and public commentswere solicited.DAC 86-9, Item IIIA proposed rule was published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on September 3, 1987 (52 FR 33450) and publiccomments were solicited.DAC 86-9, Item VA proposed rule was published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on March 18, 1987 (52 FR 8481) and public commentswere solicited. In general, the comments received supported the revision.Therefore, the proposed rule was issued as a final rule, without modification,in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on December 11, 1987 (52 FR 47005).DAC 86-9, Items XI and XIIPublic comments were not solicited with respect to these items becausethey provide informational material.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>DAC 86-9, Items I, III, IV, and VI through XThese revisions are not ``significant revisions'' as defined in FAR 1.501-1;i.e., they do not alter the substantive meaning of any coverage in theDFARS having a significant effect beyond the internal operating proceduresof the issuing agencies. Accordingly, and consistent with section 1212of Pub. L. 98-525 and section 302 of Pub. L. 98-577 pertaining to publicationof proposed regulations, solicitation of agency and public views on theserevisions is not required. Since such solicitation is not required, theRegulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.) does not apply.DAC 86-9, Item IIThis rule which amends Subpart 205.4 and adds a new clause at 252.205-7000will have a beneficial impact on a substantial number of small entitieswithin the meaning of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.,because small businesses will be furnished with points of contact who willprovide small business with information needed to obtain additional subcontracts.An interim rule was published in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> on April 16, 1987 (52 FR 12387) and public commentswere solicited.

Defense Acquisition Circular (DAC) 86-9 amends the DoD Federal AcquisitionRegulation Supplement (DFARS) and prescribes procedures to be followed.The following is a summary of the amendments and procedures: <ITAG tagnum="84">Item I_Electronic Security command </ITAG>DFARS 202.101(a) is revised to add the Electronic Security Command to thelist of Contracting Activities for the Department of the Air Force. <ITAG tagnum="84">Item II_ Providing Subcontractor Information to Cooperative AgreementHolders </ITAG>Section 957 of the Defense Acquisition Improvement Act of 1986 (Pub. L.99-500) requires defense contractors awarded a contract over $500,000 toprovide Cooperative Agreement holders with a list of appropriate employeesresponsible for award of subcontractors under defense contracts. Such listingsneed to be provided only upon the specific requests of Cooperative Agreementholders, and need not be provided more than once each year to a CooperativeAgreement holder. A Cooperative Agreement holder is a state or local governmentor private nonprofit organization which has an agreement with the DefenseLogistics Agency to furnish procurement technical assistance to businessentities. DFARS 205.470 and a clause at 252.205-7000 are added to provideguidance in effecting the above-mentioned requirement. <ITAG tagnum="84">Item III_Acquisition From Firms Owned or Controlled by Foreign Governmentsthat Support Terrorism </ITAG>10 U.S.C. 2327 prohibits award, without a waiver from the Secretary ofDefense, of a contract by a Defense agency to a firm or a subsidiary ofa firm in which a foreign government owns or controls a significant interest,if such foreign government is the government of a country that has beendetermined by the Secretary of State to be one that has repeatedly providedsupport for acts of international terrorism. DFARS 209.170 is added toimplement this restriction.
