Fitzwater, in Maine with the vacationing President Bush, saiddiscussion of any increase in the $119 million aid package Bushannounced last month was premature. He said too little is knownabout the structure of Poland's changing government.   ``It's too early at this point to know how they (Poland'sleaders) are going to make it work, let alone how it will work,''Fitzwater said.   At the State Department in Washington, spokesman Richard Bouchersaid, ``We've got a lot under way to do the steps the president'salready announced, and that's our priority right now.''   Fitzwater suggested the Bush administration had no major problemswith a coalition government in which a non-communist prime ministerwill divide authority with a communist president, although it meansthe communists will still control the military, the police and thecourts.   He applauded Poland for ``the changes that have been made there''over the past months toward more democracy.   ``All the words I said yesterday are operable today. You may usethem freely,'' said Fitzwater. On Thursday, the spokesman calledmovement toward a non-communist government in Poland``history-making and remarkable.''   Fitzwater said the administration would reserve formal comment onnews reports that Polish President Wojciech Jaruzelski had chosenSolidarity activist Tadeusz Mazowiecki to be the new prime ministerand lead the East bloc's first non-communist government.   Still, White House aides privately said they were pleased withthe apparent choice of Mazowiecki, a journalist and close associateof Solidarity leader Lech Walesa.   Fitzwater told reporters that letters from the president toWalesa and Jaruzelski being carried by Senate Minority Leader BobDole, R-Kan., were ``just letters of greeting'' and did not containmessages on the current power shuffle. Dole left Washington Fridayon a trip that will include a visit to Poland.   Bush has said his administration would reward Poland forpolitical reform, and he unveiled the $119 million package of U.S.aid during his visit to Poland last month.   Fitzwater said U.S. budget restraints continue to be a factor inany possible boost in U.S. aid. ``We don't have a lot of money tooffer.''   ``At this point, it's just far too early to talk about signals ofwhat we will do (in terms of more U.S. aid) or what's available tous,'' Fitzwater said.   Walesa told Bush in July that Poland will need at least $10billion in international aid. U.S. allies are expected to meet inEurope in late September to discuss a multi-nation rescue package tosupplement the U.S. aid.   At the State Department, Boucher said the next step involves``the concerted international efforts.''   ``The Summit Seven agreed to a program of concerted efforts topromote reform in Poland and Hungary. Twenty-four countries attendedthe first meeting on Aug. 1, at which food assistance was discussed.The next meeting is scheduled for late September,'' he said.   Fitzwater said that the new Polish government, no matter whatprecise form it takes, has its work cut out for it getting thenation's financial house in order.   ``Economically it is going to be very difficult'' for any newgovernment in Poland. He said problems would ``take a good deal ofpatience and determination'' to solve.   The spokesman said that the White House has had no direct contactwith officials in Poland. ``We're just watching things as theyhappen,'' he said.   ``The situation is changing rapidly there and we would prefer notto have any further comment on the process until we reach a pointwhere we have some assurances of how the government is going to beformed,'' he added.   On another subject, Fitzwater said former President Carter wasacting on his own in inviting warring factions in Ethiopia to meetwith him in Atlanta next month for peace talks.   ``He is not acting on behalf of the U.S. government and does nothave any official capacity or endorsement by us,'' Fitzwater said.   ``Obviously, if he can be successful or be a help in pulling theparties together there, that's all for the better,'' he said. ``Butit's strictly a private initiative.''   On the second day of his 2{-week vacation, Bush went boating withfamily members and played a round of golf.   Bush kept up the constant banter with reporters on the golfcourse that has often marked his outings here.   As he teed off on the first hole, Bush told reporters:   ``The crowd is hushed. They sense that `Mr. Smooth.' is back.''   Asked if he had seen a television interview the night before withVice President Dan Quayle, Bush answered:   ``No, I didn't see it last night. I'm on my vacation.''</TEXT></DOC>
