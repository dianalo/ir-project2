On the other hand, exchangebetween benzene-d{sub 0} and D{sub 2} was facile at 70{sup 0}C and 1atm over reduced (eMo {approx} 1.7) and at 200{sup 0}C over sulfided(eMo {approx} 3.0) catalysts. The exchange reaction also occurred overthe alumina support at an intermediate rate. Over alumina the exchangeat 70{sup 0}C was stepwise (M = k/sub theta/k{sub 0} {approx} 1.0), butas the temperature and hence k{sub 0} increased, multiple exchange (M{ge} 2.0) set in. The usual tests showed that this was not a result ofa pore diffusion limitation. The rate of exchange of C{sub 6}D{sub 6}with the alumina hydroxyl groups increased sharply as the temperaturewas increased to near 200{sup 0}C in a way which mimicked the increasein M. Thus, the increase in multiplicity may be ascribed to the openingof new pathways for exchange. The much faster rates and higher valuesof M obtained over the reduced catalysts than over the sulfided ones,coupled with the results of poisoning experiments using NO and CO{sub2} (both of which drastically reduced the rates and returned the exchangeprocess to M {approx} 1.0), demonstrated that with the reduced catalystboth portions of the surface act synergistically. The results may berationalized by the supposition that exchange occurs on the alumina supportand that hydrogen may spill-over on reduced catalysts, but not on sulfidedones. In the exchange reactions, alkylaromatics were found to have higherrates for ring than for side chain hydrogens</TEXT></DOC>
