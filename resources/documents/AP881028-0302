But it's not something out a Halloween horror movie; it's the bigbusiness of bones. Medical Plastics Laboratory Inc. says itslife-size reproductions of skeletons rake in millions of dollars.   Thousands of the skeletons are used by doctors, hospitals andmedical schools around the world. The bones also have made their wayinto rock music videos by the Grateful Dead and props for the``Miami Vice'' TV series.   ``There's really no one we can't sell to,'' Jerry Smith, directorof special projects, said recently. ``We have something foreverybody.''   Medical Plastics is now in its fourth decade of taking a humanskeleton, making molds and duplicating it.   Until 1985, real skeletons were imported from India. But thatsource was lost when the Indian government, concerned about graverobbing, halted such sales.   ``Right now, there is a market simply because there are no longerhuman bones available,'' said Joe Herndon, Medical Plastics'national sales manager. ``So people have no choice. They have to buya plastic or reproduction of a skeleton. And we feel we produce theone that has the greatest detail.''   In the past two years, sales of skeletons and other MedicalPlastics products such as first-aid training mannequins have doubledto $3 million, and should approach $5 million a year, Herndon said.   The company, which employs 125 people, was started in 1949 by twoGatesville physicians and a dentist who grew tired of waiting formonths and months to get a model of a skull.   According to Herndon, the three were booted out of their homes bytheir wives because the plastics they were experimenting withsmelled so bad. They finally produced their first skull in an oldchicken coop.   The skull _ dubbed ``Yorick'' after the skull in ``Hamlet'' _ ison display in a glass case in the company's office lobby.   From skulls, the company evolved to full skeletons, organs andtraining mannequins, which account for more than half the business,according to Herndon.   The mannequins, which are bought by the government and the armedforces, are used to teach emergency workers and others how to treatwounds, administer injections and perform cardiopulmonaryresuscitation.   Some have names. Mr. Hurt, for example, sports a broken nose andjaw and a skull fracture.   The key to the company's skeletal success is that the facsimileis so detailed it defies detection as artificial.   Bones are made from a plastic that has the same consistency,weight and color as real bones. They even react the same underX-rays.   ``It's got to be perfect,'' said Sheli Allen, one of severalpeople who assemble the skeletons. ``If it's not perfect, then itwon't look like a real body.''   Depending on the amount of custom work, full-size skeletons rangein price from $995 to nearly $3,500. Less detailed models, intendedfor elementary school use, start at $365.   Despite all efforts, however, some bones _ particularly thoseinside the skull and in the nasal cavity _ defy human attempts tocopy.   ``Try as we may, we do our very best to approximate the skeleton,but you just cannot duplicate Mother Nature,'' Herndon said.</TEXT></DOC>
