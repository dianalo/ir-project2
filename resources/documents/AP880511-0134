In a sort of political tease for the formal endorsement Reaganwill make tonight at a Republican Party dinner here, the president,accompanied by Bush, walked into the Cabinet Room to waiting GOPcongressional leaders.   As they emerged, the lawmakers applauded.   ``I just have very brief announcement to make and that is thatI'll have something to say about the campaign tonight,'' Reagansaid.   The president then walked over to the table, sat down next tovanquished Republican presidential hopeful Bob Dole, and grinnedwidely as reporters tried to question him, saying at one point hehad other business that needed more immediate attention.   Bush smiled, walked to the other side of the table, and took hisseat across from Reagan.   A short time later, Pat Robertson told reporters at the WhiteHouse he gave Bush his endorsement in a private meeting and said hewould withdraw from the GOP race on Monday.   ``I will be making that official on Monday ... because the raceis pretty much over,'' said Robertson, who has won only 46delegates in the Republican primary and caucus competition.   ``I didn't ask anything for myself'' in the meeting with Bush,he said. ``I spoke about education and the need to bring the 1984platform into line with the realities of 1988,'' he said.   As Robertson was speaking to reporters just outside the WhiteHouse, Bush appeared with several aides on the second floor balconyof the vice president's office in the Old Executive OfficeBuilding, across the street, and waved.   Robertson said he told Bush he would work to get his supportersto back the vice president. He said that Bush made no assurancesabout specific issues.   ``We definitely had a meeting of the minds on the platform,''Robertson said. ``My feelings and his feelings were totally inharmony, that the 1984 document of the Republican Party platform issomething we can all unify behind.''   Reagan's blessing later in the day will be anti-climatic, sinceit comes two weeks after the Pennsylvania primary in which Bush wonsufficient Republican convention delegates to lock up the partynomination.   The president chose a Cabinet Room meeting with GOPcongressional leaders to say he would complete the publicendorsement of Bush tonight at a Republican Party dinner here.   The timing of Reagan's endorsement had been the subject ofhigh-level jockeying between Bush campaign and White Houseofficials in recent days, although there never was any seriousquestion that Reagan supported Bush.   Two weeks ago, when Reagan was asked on the day after thePennsylvania primnary whether he was endorsing Bush, the presidentreplied that he thought the time had come for that, but that hewasn't quite ready to do it. ``Let us see,'' he told reporters.   Reagan had steadfastly maintained from the outset of theRepublican competition, early last year, that he would remainneutral until a nominee emerged.   The president had said that as titular leader of his party, itwould be inappropriate to do otherwise.</TEXT></DOC>
