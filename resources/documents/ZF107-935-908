 At thepodium, Bill Gates revealed his plan to join forces with Apple to produce anew font outline standard to supplant PostScript.andP;  It would obviously bebased on PostScript itself, or at least on a clone, since Microsoft had justbought Bauer Enterprises, producer of a PostScript clone.andM;Apple would use this clone, thus saving on royalties to Adobe.andP;  In turn,Apple would turn over to Microsoft a bunch of proprietary software that wouldmake it easier for Microsoft to improve the inferior graphical interface itsells to IBM and the world of clones.andP;  Does this sound like a good idea toyou?andM;Adobe honcho John Warnock, visibly shaken by an attack on his small firm,then announced that all of Adobe's font-technology secrets would be madepublic domain.andM;Obviously Warnock felt that the superior Adobe PostScript technology was tooimportant to the industry to be submarined by Gates, so he took the peculiarmarketing tactic of essentially giving away the razor blades and selling therazors!andP;  All the while, the wily Steve Jobs was lurking in the background; hecalled the Gates maneuver &quot;political.&quot;andP;  Jobs sees Gates as panickly andfearful of losing his privileged place at the IBM dinner table.andP;  Jobs was atthe show with a slew of NeXT machines running Display PostScript.andP;  Perhapsseeing Jobs in bed with Adobe irked the powers at Apple, who perceive Steveand his peculiar IBM-Ross Perot-Canon axis as a genuine threat, even if hecan't sell ten machines.andP;  So Apple will make a strange alliance withMicrosoft, a company it recently sued over its Windows interface.andP;  So muchfor the lawsuit.andM;Supposedly this newfound alliance is arranged so the two companies candevelop this new font technology together.andP;  But I ask you, what has Microsoftever developed except MS-BASIC, a mouse, and Excel?andP;  Everything else itbought from other companies that could do it better.andP;  Rather than developingproducts, Microsoft has become the world's biggest upgrade and maintenanceprogramming house.andP;  Even MS-DOS was bought from Seattle Computer Products.andM;What Microsoft discovered from the MS-DOS purchase and the subsequent dealwith IBM was that the big dough is made by finding something to license.andP;  Toheck with database managers and accounting packages.andP;  Let Ashton-Tate andComputer Associates have those markets; they're too much work.andP;  Sure Excel,BASIC, and the like make money.andP;  But look at the dough you can make withlicenses!andP;  Besides MS-DOS, what is the big money-maker in the world oflicensing?andP;  PostScript, that's what.andM;Another characteristic of Microsoft is its constant upgrading of productsthat were never great to begin with.andP;  Upgrades are profit centers.andP;  TakeMicrosoft Word (please!).andP;  It must scare the pants off Warnock to see what agreat job of marketing Microsoft does with a word processor that is hardlythe best.andM;Fact is, Microsoft has become a superb marketing company, period.andP;  So if youcan sell well, then sell what brings in the most bang for the buck: alicense.andP;  Make other people manufacture and produce and even support yourproduct while they pay you for the privilege.andP;  The company wants to licenseDOS, OS/2, XENIX, Windows, and now some sort of PostScript clone.andP;  If Applegoes along with the idea, Microsoft will get rich on PostScript.andP;  In theprocess, it will learn enough tricks from Apple to improve OS/2 and have evenmore licenses to sell!andM;Well, I still haven't answered the big question: So what's in it for Apple?andO;Of all the computer companies in the world that don't need Microsoft foranything, Apple must be No.andP;  1.andP;  Apple has its own operating systems.andP;  Mostof the programs written for the Mac are done in THINK C or some non-Microsoftlanguage.andP;  All Microsoft brings to the party is Excel.andP;  A revival of the oldCrunch program or even a real Lotus clone would make Excel as expendable asWord on the Mac.andP;  Microsoft has no foothold, so why give it one when it feedsthe world of the cheap PC power-clone?andP;  This, I thought, was the enemy!andO;Whatever edge Apple has will be transferred to the competition in a minute.andO;Apple loses sales while Microsoft, like a neutral arms dealer in a fomentedwar, profits from both sides of the battle.andM;I don't see what Apple hopes to gain from his alliance.andP;  It could have boughtand developed a PostScript clone itself.andP;  Perhaps it's a trap of some sortdesigned to set up Gates for an unusual lawsuit.andP;  Maybe it's worth riskingthe transfer of Apple technology to the world of the PC if you can get deepenough inside Microsoft to discover something for which you can sue the pantsoff them -- and IBM.andP;  You know how Apple loves to use the courts to protectits interests.andM;Apple doesn't want to stop supporting PostScript -- that's for sure, sincenearly all the high-end typesetters have taken the hint and offer support.andO;There's no way a Microsoft-Bauer PostScript clone will do the job of Adobe'ssoftware, either.andP;  The Adobe stuff is terrific.andP;  But Apple needs some low-endrelief so it can sell its $900 Mac of the future with a cheap laser printer.andO;It can't afford to spend more than a buck per machine for PostScript on alow-end printer.andP;  It needed price relief, and obviusly Adobe was too slow tomove.andP;  Also, Adobe's Display PostScript is slow, and its inability to workadequately with color might be part of the problem.andP;  I'm sure Microsoft said,&quot;Hey, look how big we are.andP;  Together we can lick these problems and own thecode too!&quot;andP;  If all works out, then Apple gets a cheap (and probably inferior)outline-font technology and Microsoft gets something it can license.andM;And the beat goes on.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
