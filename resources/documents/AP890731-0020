WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The nation's governors are stepping carefullyaround the emotional issue of abortion, avoiding direct discussionof it at their annual meeting even as each ponders the politicalquagmire it could create back home.   While a small band of abortion-rights protesters demonstratedoutside Sunday, governors attending the four-day NationalGovernors' Association conference said they planned no discussionof the issue despite the recent Supreme Court decision givingstates broader leeway to regulate abortion.   Several acknowledged the issue may dominate their state'spolitics and legislatures in coming months.   ``It will bring out some polarized feelings,'' said DelawareGov. Michael Castle, a Republican. ``I think in the course of thenext year or two that will be a dominant issue.   ``It's important that we not let it dominate our statelegislatures,'' Castle said. ``It has that ability to dominatethings so much that you can't do anything else.''   Another governor sharing that concern was Maryland's WilliamDonald Schaefer.   Schaefer, a Democrat, said he would ask the legislature toconfine debate and action on abortion to the first 30 days of itsnext session.   ``Otherwise it could disrupt and cause great problems,'' saidSchaefer, who since taking office has backed off a campaignstatement supporting Medicaid funding for abortions.   Virginia Gov. Gerald Baliles, chairman of the association, saidthe governors weren't discussing abortion because their agenda wasset before the Supreme Court's ruling in a Missouri case.   Baliles, a Democrat who supports legal abortions in most cases,said formal discussion by the governors wouldn't likely produce anagreement anyway.   ``This is a decision that will have to be argued within eachstate,'' he said. ``It is a topic that is unlikely to achieve thekind of consensus that would produce a policy resolution by theNational Governors' Association.''   In interviews, several governors sought to minimize thediscretion afforded to the states by the high court decision, whicheroded but did not overturn the earlier Roe vs. Wade decisionupholding a woman's right to an abortion.   They had an eye, however, on abortion cases scheduled to comebefore the Supreme Court this fall.   ``You won't really know what the dimensions of this issue isuntil the Supreme Court decides the three other cases pending,''said Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, a Democrat. ``It's an emotionalissue. If the Supreme Court overturns Roe v. Wade, you've got awhole different issue.''   ``Most people are waiting for the other shoe to drop,'' saidCastle.   In view of polls saying a majority of America support legalizedabortion in some cases, the issue may pose more political problemsfor candidates who favor restricting or banning abortion, at leastin some states. In the two governors' races this year, in Virginiaand New Jersey, the Republican nominees have softened theiranti-abortion stands in recent weeks.   Republican governors will have a look at a new poll on theissue, commissioned by their party, at a closed meeting Tuesday,said Michele Davis, executive director of the Republican Governors'Association. The conference ends Tuesday.   Gov. Thomas Kean of New Jersey, a Republican who leaves officeafter this year, said he hoped the issue would not be so divisivethat voters elect candidates solely on how they stand on abortion.   ``I think it would be a great tragedy if people were to decidewho to vote for just on this issue, because I think we'd elect somevery strange people,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
