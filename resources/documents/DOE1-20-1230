The steps are: lining the interior of the primarycombustion chamber of the staged low NO/sub x/ burner with a first layerof fibrous, thermally insulative material comprised of ceramic fibers,the first layer of insulation material having a density falling withinthe range of 3 to 30 lbs. per cubic foot, and lining the interior ofthe first layer of thermally insulative material with a coating of atough, durable refractory material, whereby the thermal energy storedin the thermally insulative liner is reduced while reducing the weightof the insulative liner and while protecting the first fibrous insulativelayer from the deleterious effects of the combustion processes.</TEXT></DOC>
