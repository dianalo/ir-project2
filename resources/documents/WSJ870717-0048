The defense and electronics concern earned $100 million, or $1.51 a share, compared with $96 million, or $1.45 a share, a year earlier. Sales rose 13% to $2.89 billion from $2.56 billion.    Lockheed said its interest expense rose to $55 million in the quarter from $20 million a year earlier, while pre-tax profit from its defense and other programs increased 7.1% to $362 million from $338 million. Total debt on June 28 was $1.2 billion, compared with $1.6 billion at year's end, the company said. It paid $1.18 billion last year for Sanders, a defense-electronics concern.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Lockheed shares closed yesterday at $57.25, off 50 cents.    For the first half, net income rose 1.6% to $186 million, or $2.81 a share, from $183 million, or $2.77 a share, a year earlier. Sales increased 13% to $5.45 billion from $4.81 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
