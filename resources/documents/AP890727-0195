Shamir's remarks in an impassioned fist-thumping speech torabbis in Jerusalem came as PLO Chief Yasser Arafat also appearedto harden his position by publishing four tough preconditions toaccepting the Israeli peace proposal.   The Israeli plan calls for 1.7 million Palestinians in theoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to elect representatives tonegotiate an interim settlement of self-rule.   Arafat, in demands outlined by Egypt's state-owned newspaper,Al-Ahram, called on Israel to agree to Palestinian statehood in theoccupied territories and to withdraw troops in 27 months.   In violence in the occupied lands, soldiers fatally shot a20-year-old Palestinian in the chest during a stone-throwingprotest in the West Bank's Tulkarem refugee camp, Arab reportssaid. The Palestinian was identified as Mohammed Omar Safouri.   An 11-year-old boy was seriously wounded in the same incident,the reports said. The army said it was checking the reports.   Two Palestinian teen-agers, aged 14 and 15, suffered moderategunshot wounds in clashes with soldiers in the Gaza Strip,according to Arab reports.   In Jerusalem, police detained a 14-year-old Palestinian girl whostabbed and injured an officer as he grabbed her during astone-throwing demonstration, city police spokesman Uzi Sandorisaid.   Also Thursday, Khaled Naif Abdeen, 23, was axed to death in thetown of Khan Yunis in the Gaza Strip, apparently as a suspectedcollaborator with Israeli authorities, the reports said. The armyconfirmed the slaying but said the circumstances were unclear.   The fatalities raised the death toll to 521 Palestinians killedby Israeli soldiers or civilians, and 85 killed by fellow Arabsduring the 19-month-old uprising against Israeli rule. Thirty-eightIsraelis also have died in the unrest.   In his speech broadcast on Israel radio, Shamir said Americanleaders ``tried to persuade me to include in the initiative, as oneof its principle parts, conceding part of the land of Israel. Evenwith a hint, using the diplomatic words, land for peace.''   ``I rejected this wholeheartedly because I say and believe it ispossible to reach peace without, heaven forbid, giving up a grainof the holy land of our forefathers,'' Shamir said, as he was heardpounding his fist on a table.   He also vowed to continue Jewish settlement building in theoccupied territories, despite persistent warnings from the U.S.that the settlements are an obstacle to peace.   ``We will stand by their (the settlers') side and build manyJewish settlements all over the land of Israel,'' Shamir said.   But hardliners in Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc criticized hislatest meetings with Palestinians, charging he was circumventing agovernment boycott of the PLO, Israeli reports said.   The criticism of Shamir followed reports that a pro-PLO lawyerfrom the West Bank town of Ramallah, Jamil Tarifi, had met theIsraeli prime minister secretly this month.   The PLO's news agency, Wafa, said in Tunis Thursday that themeeting with Tarifi was ``with the knowledge and approval of thePalestinian leadership.''   Shamir has acknowledged meeting with Palestinians saying thetalks were aimed only at finding dialogue partners outside the PLO.   Israel rejects dialogue with the PLO claiming it is a terroristorganization bent on the country's destruction.   Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin, said the meetings wereproductive despite a wide gap between Israeli and Palestinianpositions.   ``There are signs of a relaxation in the air,'' Rabin said ontelevision, referring to a decline in violent incidents in thedisputed lands. ``There are signs of increasing desire to move theprocess from a violent conflict to a political solution.''   In his remarks to the Egyptian newspaper, Arafat said Israel'selection plan was ``a good idea,'' but said it should lead toformation of a Palestinian state.   He also called for a partial Israeli troop withdrawal in advanceof elections, U.N. supervision of balloting, a total Israelipullout and repatriation of Palestinian refugees.   Israel has rejected all these positions.   In the Gaza Strip, meanwhile, four prominent doctors urged theUnited States to play a greater role in pressuring Israel to makeconcessions.   Lawyer Zuhair El-Rais, a founding member of the PLO, said hetold U.S. Ambassador to Tel Aviv William Brown, America must be ``afull partner to the peace process... They must put more pressure onIsrael and practice a more balanced policy toward Palestinians.''</TEXT></DOC>
