Name's AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph.''   An unlikely script? Perhaps. But after spending decades as theepitome of the staid blue chip, ATandamp;T stock has lately beenthreatening to transform itself into something more zippy.   When it climbed to $34.62 last week in response to afirst-quarter earnings report that lived up to Wall Street's hopes,ATandamp;T sported a gain of 20.4 percent since the beginning of 1989,roughly doubling the performance of the market as a whole.   The rally put the stock just a little more than a point shy ofthe peak of $35.87 it reached before the crash of 1987, while manyother big-name issues still languish far from their former highs.   ``The shares of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph have been one ofthe market's better performers so far this year, and we believethey will continue to do well on an intermediate and long-termbasis,'' asserts the current edition of the Merrill Lynch MarketLetter.   Such sanguine appraisals have seldom been heard on Wall Streetin recent years, especially since the company was established inits current form with the breakup of the Bell System on Jan. 1,1984.   The ``Baby Bells'' _ the seven regional operating companies thatwere split off from ATandamp;T in the divestiture _ almost immediatelygalloped out ahead of their progenitor.   Within three years, all of them more than doubled in price. Thenew ATandamp;T, which had begun trading at $19, meanwhile struggled alongin the mid $20s.   The Baby Bells showered their owners with dividend increases andstock splits. ATandamp;T's dividend remained stuck at $1.20 a share. Iteven reported a loss for 1988, as a result of a $3.9 billionspecial charge it took to write off outdated equipment.   A once-popular and widely understood company with more than 3million shareholders had become a murky entity involved in amixture of new and old ventures whose prospects were difficult todiscern.   ``There have been many _ and often confusing _ changes in thecompany'' since the breakup, Merrill Lynch analysts acknowledge ina written appraisal.   ``But we believe ATandamp;T now is heading into a period of steady andsustainable earnings growth that will make its stock moreattractive to investors.   ``Among other things, the company seems likely to win moreattention from large institutional investors, who now own only 24percent of its stock _ a relatively low level for one of thelargest and most widely held stocks.''   At its annual meeting last Wednesday, the company reported a20.7 percent earnings increase for the first quarter. ChairmanRobert Allen said that pace was ``not an aberration'' and mightwell be sustained in quarters to come.   The company attributed its improved results to better profitsfrom long-distance operations and from international sales of itsproducts and services. Merrill Lynch expects it also to showsmaller losses from its computer business as the year progresses.   In a deregulated world, ATandamp;T continues to face more competitionand risks than it ever knew before the breakup. As big as itremains, it cannot reasonably hope to produce the kind of dramaticearnings gains that true growth-stock fanciers like to see.   Still, as its stock price shows, the company seems lately tohave won back some old friends on Wall Street, and even made somenew ones.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Monday, April 24</NOTE></DOC>
