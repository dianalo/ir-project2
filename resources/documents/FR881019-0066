The Departmenthas now completed that administrative review in accordance with section751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act'').Imports covered by this review are shipments of portable electric typewriterscurrently classified under Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated(``TSUSA'') item 676.0510, and some currently classifiable under TSUSAitem 676.0540, and Harmonized Tariff System item numbers HS 8469.21.00and 8469.29.00.As stated in the preliminary results notice, the scope of the antidumpingduty order is currently in litigation. On September 20, 1988, the Courtof International Trade upheld the Department's determination, upon remand,that portable electric typewriters incorporating a calculating mechanismare within the scope of the antidumping duty order, and reversed the Department'sdetermination that portable electric typewriters with text memory (``automaticportable electric typewriters), are not included in the scope of the order.<T3>See Smith Corona Corporation v. United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-127(September 20, 1988). If this decision is finally affirmed by the courts,we will separately review unliquidated entries of automatic portable electrictypewriters, and portable electric typewriters incorporting a calculatingmechanism. The products subject to this review are non-automatic portableelectric typewriters that do not incorporate a calculating mechanism. The review covers eleven manufacturers and/or exporters of Japanese portableelectric typewriters to the United States and various periods from April1, 1982 through April 30, 1986 (but generally from May 1, 1982 throughApril 30, 1986). <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments Received</ITAG>We invited interested parties to comment on the preliminary results. Wereceived timely comments from the petitioner, Smith Corona Corporation(``SCM''), and seven respondents, Brother Industries Ltd. and Brother InternationalCorporation (``Brother''), Canon Inc. and Canon U.S.A. (``Canon''), NakajimaAll Co., Ltd. (``Nakajima''), Silver Seiko, Ltd. and Silver Reed America(``Silver''), Towa Sankiden Corporation (``Towa''), Juki Corporation andJuki Office Machine Corporation (``Juki''), and Matusushita Electric Corporationof America (``Matsushita'').We also received comments from one respondent, Ricoh Corporation, and oneimporter, Sears Roebuck and Co., on July 15, 1988 and August 31, 1988,respectively. Because these comments were received after the close of thecomment period, we have not considered them for these final results. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Petitioner's Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1: </T3>SCM argues that U.S. prices should be reduced by thefull amount of advertising expenses incurred by Brother in Japan and inthe United States for sponsorship of the 1984 Olympic games. The Olympicadvertising campaign was image-building for the company's entire typewriterline and the expenses should be attributed to all U.S. typewriter sales.Many models covered by the scope of this review are sold through officeequipment dealers in addition to consumer product outlets. SCM maintainsthat, although it was determined in the review of the 1981-82 period thatthe 1984 Olympic campaign was directed towards Brothers' office typewriterline, a portion of the expenses are attributable to PET models sold byoffice equipment dealers, because they benefited directly from the Olympicadvertising campaign. SCM states that deductions for this expense were improperly allocated tothird-country and home market sales as well as to U.S. sales. SCM arguesthat even indirect selling expenses must be attributed to a particularmarket. To allocate these expenses as direct selling expenses on the basisof the value of world-wide sales is contrary to Department precedent. Furthermore,Brother has failed to establish that the expenses could be reasonably allocatedto markets on the basis of sales value. Therefore, all Olympic advertisingexpenses should be allocated only over U.S. sales.Brother argues that the deduction of the Olympic advertising expenses iscontrary to agency practice. <T3>See Color Television Receivers from Korea</T3> (49 FR 50420, December24, 1984), <T3>Television Receiving Sets, Monochrome and Color, from Japan</T3> (50FR 24278, June 10, 1985) and <T3>Color Picture Tubes from Japan</T3> (52 FR 44171, November 18, 1987).Brother asserts that in these cases it was established that model-specificor product-specific advertisements are directly related to the productshown or described in the advertisement. Therefore, the cost for each advertisementmay be deducted in calculating United States price (``USP''), or foreignmarket value (``FMV''), only for the product or model in the advertisement.Brother stresses that verification of this expense in the prior reviewindicated that all Olympic advertisement were directed towards Brother's``office'' typewriters and all model-specific advertisements depicted anEM-series office machine.In addition, Brother contends that the deduction of Olympic advertisingexpenses in the USP calculations for the 1982-83, 1983-84, and 1984-85periods is an abrupt reversal of the policy announced in the <T3>Final Results of Administration Review of Portable Electric Typewritersfrom Japan</T3> for the 1981-82 period (52 FR 1504, January 14, 1987).The Department is attempting to distinguish Brother's Olympic advertisementfrom the above-cited cases because Brother International Corporation (``BIC'')sells PETs through both its office equipment division (``OED'') and consumerproducts division (``CPD''). This does not justify deviation from the policyestablished in these cases, and the Department has neglected to explainthe deviation. Furthermore, Brother contends the Department's allocationmethodology is flawed.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree with Brother and have revisedour position. Consistent with the final results in the review covering1981-82 sales of PETs, we have not made a deduction from USP for Brother'ssponsorship of the 1984 games. We disregard advertising expenses when suchexpenses are incurred exclusively for models outside the scope of the order.In the previous review, we determined that Brother's 1984 Olympic advertisingcampaign was devoted exclusively to Brother's EM-series office machines.SCM has not submitted convincing evidence that Brother's PET models directlybenefited from the Olympic advertisements. Furthermore, it would be inappropriateto allocated some of these expenses, which have been determined to be attributableto Brother's office typewriters, to PET models simply because they aresold through OEDs. We consider the advertising to be related to particularproducts, not to a particular channel of distribution.<T3>Comment 2:</T3> SCM argues that Olympic advertising expenses shouldbe deducted from the U.S. sales price of all models sold through OEDs,rather than from only the sales price of the seven models noted in theDepartment's preliminary results analysis memorandum.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> For these final results, we make no adjustmentfor Olympic advertising expenses. (See our response to Comment 1.)<T3>Comment 3:</T3> SCM argues that the expenses for financing a trip tothe 1984 Olympics for Brother's ``National Accounts'' customers shouldbe specifically and solely allocated to purchase price sales.Brother maintains that the term ``National Accounts'' has no relationshipto BIC's PET purchase price sales but rather refers to customers who areserviced directly by Brother Industries Ltd. (``BIL'') headquarters.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> SCM has submitted no evidence that ``NationalAccounts'' expenses are related to U.S. sales. Therefore, we have madeno change in our calculation.<T3>Comment 4:</T3> SCM argues that advertising expenses for the 1988 Olympicsshould be deducted from the U.S. sales price of all models during the 1985-86review period, based on the best information available. Brother incurredexpenses for its sponsorship of the 1984 Olympic games as early as January1981; therefore, it is likely that Olympic advertising expenses for the1988 games were incurred prior to the end of the 1985-86 review period.Brother asserts that neither BIC nor BIL incurred any Olympic advertisingexpenses during the 1985-86 review period. It states that the sponsorshipagreement for the 1988 Olympic games was not signed until March 31, 1987,and SCM's reliance on what happened with respect to the 1984 Olympics isirrelevant to Brother's experience with the 1988 Olympics.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree with Brother and have not madea deduction from USP in the 1985-86 review period for Brother's sponsorshipof the 1988 Olympic games. The advertising expenses for this campaign willbe considered in administrative reviews for subsequent periods. We aresatisfied that Brother did not begin incurring the expenses until afterthe close of the period under review.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> SCM argues that Brother's export sales division expensesincurred in Japan should be deducted from exporter's sales price (``ESP'').Department's Position: For the final results we have allocated the selling,general, and administrative (``SGandamp;A'') expenses incurred by BrotherInternational Corporation/Japan (``BIC/Japan''), BIL's related companywhich handles export sales, over total sales made through BIC/Japan, andmade the appropriate deduction from ESP.<T3>Comment 6: </T3>SCM argues that Brother's credit costs should be computedby customer and by period, due to extended credit terms offered duringpromotional periods. It maintains that the use of average credit periodsdistorts the calculation of ESP.Brother argues that it would be impossible to report transaction-specificpayment periods because payments are not linked to sales of specific products,but rather to invoices, and payments would have to be traced to the largenumber of invoices issued. Moreover, the Department has permitted averagingof credit expenses in the past in this and other cases.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have determined, as in the prior review,that the use of averaged collection periods is reasonable.<T3>Comment 7: </T3>SCM argues that the imputed inventory carrying costreferred to by SCM as imputed credit costs, was incorrectly based on theBIL/BIC transfer prices, and that these prices are not reliable. SCM suggeststhat the Department recompute this cost using net U.S. selling prices ratherthan the transfer prices.Brother asserts that the transfer prices are the correct basis for computinginventory carrying costs because they reflect the cost to BIC of holdingthe merchandise in inventory prior to the U.S. sales. Also, the use oftransfer prices is consistent with post practice.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The F.O.B. prices charged by the parentcompany of its U.S. subsidiary are an accurate basis upon which to calculatethe cost of holding inventory prior to the sale to an unrelated U.S. customer.The transfer prices best reflect the cost of the merchandise as it is enteredinto inventory. The selling price from BIC to the unrelated purchase reflectsselling costs incurred by BIC as well as BIC's profit. BIL does not extendcredit for these purposes; therefore, it would be inappropriate to imputeto BIL an interest expense for these additional costs and profit. The useof transfer prices in computing this expense is consistent with Departmentpractice. <T3>See Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color, from Japan </T3>(53FR 4050, February 11, 1988).<T3>Comment 8: </T3>SCM argues that the SGandamp;A expenses incurred by Brother'sOED should be allocated to those EPT models sold through the OED and deductedfrom ESP.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>As in the preliminary results, we continueto make a deduction from ESP for the SGandamp;A expenses incurred by Brother'sOED from sales made through that division. A portion of the expenses incurredby this division are attributable to certain PET models, and Brother hasappropriately included the expenses in BIC's corporate overhead claim.<T3>Comment 9: </T3>SCM argues that the cost of freight insurance associatedwith Brother's U.S. sales is a direct selling expense. It is directly relatedto the sales of PETs, and should not be treated as an indirect expense.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Freight insurance expenses incurred intransporting PETs from the Japanese port to BIC's warehouse have been deductedproperly as a movement expense, and have not been treated as an indirectselling expense. The expense to which SCM refers is a blanket policy formarine and property insurance for all products and is not directly relatedto the PET sales under consideration. It has been properly categorizedas an indirect expense.<T3>Comment 10: </T3>SCM suggests that the Department ensure that the adjustmentfor warranty costs in the home market is based solely on repair expensesincurred in servicing warranty claims. SCM notes that in the review ofthe 1980-81 period, the Department made an adjustment to BIC's claimedwarranty expense for revenues generated from non-warranty work.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Based on our verification of Brother'sresponse for the 1985-86 period, we are satisfied that the home marketwarranty expenses were based on repair expenses incurred on claims madeunder warranty.<T3>Comment 11: </T3>SCM agrees with the Department's preliminary decisionto reject Brother's U.S. sales data for purchase price sales of three modelsfor the 1984-85 review period because the data were not submitted in atimely fashion. Moreover, SCM claims that, because the Department did notverify Brother's responses for the 1983-84 and 1984-85 review periods,the late submission of data on additional sales raises questions as tothe completenes of those responses. Therefore, the highest rate found forany review period should be used as the best information available forboth of these review periods.Brother disagrees with the Department's application of the highest marginfound on a sale during the 1984-85 review period to the purchase pricesales inadvertently omitted from its original response for that period.Brother, which itself discovered the omission and voluntarily submittedthe missing information, argues that such application is a disincentivefor an importer to voluntarily correct errors. Brother suggests that theDepartment either properly analyze these sales, assign to them the marginfound to exist on ESP sales of these models, or assign them the highestweighted-average margin determined to exist for a responding firm duringthe review period.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Although the Department does have discretionto use in unusual situations, information untimely submitted, respondentsmaking untimely submissions run a high risk that the Department will usethe best information otherwise available to calculate dumping margins.Absent this approach, respondents would have no incentive to make timelysubmissions. In this case, time constraints alone are sufficient to preventus from using Brother's late-submitted sales data.We disagree with SCM's position that the new data calls into question thereliability of Brother's submissions for the unverified periods, sincethe information was voluntarily submitted. We continue to use the bestinformation otherwise available only for the sales in question, and notfor all sales for the 1983-84 and 1984-85 periods. Furthermore, we agreewith Brother that the margin applied to these sales in the preliminaryresults could serve as a disincentive for respondents otherwise willingto volunteer information inadvertently omitted from the original response.For the final results, we have applied the highest weighted-average marginfound to exist for a responding firm during the 1984-85 review period toBrother's late-submitted purchase price sales.<T3>Comment 12:</T3> SCM argues that Brother's home market sales of theElectra-50 were below cost during the 1985-86 review period. Earlier inthis proceeding, SCM submitted its estimate of the cost of producing theElectra-50, compared this to Brother's home market prices for this model,and concluded that Brother had made sales of this model at prices belowthe cost of production. To counter SCM's allegation, Brother voluntarilysubmitted cost of production information for the Electra-50. SCM arguesthat, absent verification, the Department cannot rely upon Brother's submittedproduction costs, and must use constructed value, based on costs submittedby SCM, as the basis for FMV.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We see no justification for rejecting Brother'sproduction cost data based on SCM's contention that it was not verified.Brother submitted cost information to support its difference in merchandiseadjustment claims, and this information was subject to verification. Althoughcertain cost of production information was not submitted until after SCM'spost-verification allegation of sales below cost, the information was notso substantial that a new verification was warranted. The Department hasdiscretion, in accordance with section 618 of the Trade and Tariff Actof 1984 (``the 1984 Act''), to determine when submitted information shouldbe subject to verification, and when information submitted subsequent toverification should be verified. <T3>See Cyanuric Acid and Its Chlorinated Derivatives from Japan</T3> (51FR 45495, December 19, 1986). Furthermore, SCM's cost allegations withrespect to Brother's 1985-86 home market sales were untimely and its requestfor verification of data at this point in the proceeding is inappropriateand inconsistent with sound administative practices. <T3>See Color Television Receivers from Japan </T3>(49 FR 7620, March 1,1984).<T3>Comment 13:</T3> SCM argues that the Department neglected to collectall home market sales data concerning electronic typewriters incorporatingcalculators, text memory, or Japanese language capability, which may potentiallybe ``such or similar'' to the models sold to the United States.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We are satisified that all home marketsales of merchandise ``such or similar'' to the merchandise sold in theUnited States have been reported. The Department determines what constitutessuch or similar merchandise for comparison purposes, taking into considerationinformation on the record. Based on that information, we did not requireBrother to provide data on models deemd outside of the scope of the order.It is inappropriate to require respondents to submit data on sales of merchandiseoutside of the scope when there are adequate sales of more comparable modelswithin the scope of the order. Models with calculators and text memory,even if within the scope, are less similar than the reported home marketmodels to the U.S. models subject to this review, and would not have beenused in determining FMV.<T3>Comment 14:</T3> SCM argues that all of Brother's claimed adjustmentsfor home market promotional expenses should be denied because Brother failedto establish that the promotions were directed to the ultimate consumers.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Brother adequately demonstrated in itsresponse and at verification that the promotional activities were directedto end-users.<T3>Comment 15:</T3> SCM argues that, assuming Brother's home market advertisingexpenses are directly related to sales of PETs, its failure to separatelytie promotional expenses to particular models of typewriters requires theDepartment to reject the adjustment claim, or, at a minimum, permit theadjustment only as an offset to U.S. indirect selling expenses.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We are satisfied with Brother's allocationof its promotional expense amount. The Department does not require respondentsto tie promotional expenses to sales of specific models as a conditionof considering such expenses direct selling expenses. See <T3>Color Television Receivers from Korea</T3> (49 FR 50420, December 28,1984).<T3>Comment 16:</T3> SCM argues that, as a more precise allocation, multi-productadvertisement expenses should be based on the relative ``value of salesof each relevant PET model,'' as approved by the Court in <T3>Brother Industries Ltd. v. United States,</T3> 3 CIT 125, 152 540 F.Supp. 1341, 1365 (1982), rather than on the basis of sales value, as notedin the verification report. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The sales value by which we allocated multi-productadvertising expenses is, in fact, the value of sales of each relevant PETmodel.   <T3>Comment 17:</T3> SCM argues that home market warrantly expense shouldnot be allocated across all models or product lines but must be identifiedwith particular PET models. If this cannot be done, then the expenses shouldbe treated as indirect expenses subject to the ESP cap. Furthermore, SCMasserts that only parts costs should be included in the adjustment forwarranty expenses because repairmen's salaries and overhead are not directlyrelated to the sales and should be excluded from the adjustment.   <T3>Department's Position:</T3> Brother's warranty expense deduction isbased solely on variable costs for repairs to PETs, and therefore is directlyrelated to sales. We did not require Brother to report model-specific warrantyexpenses. Therefore, we have continued to allow Brother's warranty expenseclaim for the final results.    <T3>Comment 18:</T3> SCM argues that Brother's export division expensesmust be removed from the pool of home market indirect selling expenses.To the extent that these cannot be segregated from the total indirect sellingexpense amount claimed by Brother, the entire home market indirect sellingexpense adjustment should be denied.    <T3>Department's Position:</T3> As in the preliminary results, we havenot made a deduction from FMV for these expenses.   <T3>Comment 19:</T3> SCM argues that, because Brother did not identifythe cost of the U.S. promotional trips included in the reported corporateadvertising expense incurred in Japan, no corporate advertising expensesmay be included in the ESP offset. Additionally, it contends the expensesmust be deducted from USP.   Brother argues that the costs for incentive trips have been paid by itsU.S. subsidiary BIC, are recorded in BIC's accounting records, and havebeen reported in the questionnaire responses.    <T3>Department's Position:</T3> We are satisfied that the expenses forthese trips are included in BIC's reported corporate overhead expense amountsand have been deducted from USP.   <T3>Comment 20:</T3> SCM argues that, based on its own calculation of theproduction costs of the model S-15, Canon's home market sales of the S-15were made below the cost of production. SCM estimated a constructed valuefigure for the S-15 based on cost of manufacture data submitted by Canonfor the S-15 and from information provided for another model. Based onthat estimated, SCM maintains that a significant volume of these saleswere made below cost. Thus, as the basis for foreign market value, theDepartment should rely on the constructed value of this model for all salesmade below the constructed value estimated by SCM.   Canon argues that SCM's cost of production figure is inaccurate becauseit double counts the variable costs and depreciation expenses includedin the fixed factory overhead.    <T3>Department's Position:</T3> We have rejected SCM's allegation of below-costsales of the model S-15 in the home market because it was untimely. SCMhad access to Canon's cost information, on which it based its allegation,for almost one year before raising the issue. A petitioner is obligatedto make sales below cost allegations ``at the earliest possible time duringthe course of a review in order to avoid unduly delaying the review.''<T3>See certain Welded Carbon Steel Pipes and Tubes from Korea</T3> (52FR 33460, September 3, 1987). In addition, SCM's allegation was presentedafter verification of the Canon response. SCM's pre-verification comments,dated January 13, 1987, did not mention Canon's cost.   Even had the allegations been timely submitted, SCM's calculation of Canon'scost is flawed. We confirmed at verification that Canon's in-house processingis included in its variable costs and depreciation is included in the reportedfixed factory overhead. In addition, we verified portions of productioncost information for Canon models S-15 and S-55 and are satisfied withthe submitted figures. Finally, SCM's claim that a ``significant volume''of these sales were made below SCM's cost of production calculation isnot substantiated by the evidence on the record. Our review of the salesdata indicates that the selling prices for a very insignificant numberof S-15 sales fell below even SCM's submitted cost figure.   <T3>Comment 21:</T3> SCM contends that the Department should compare Canon'ssales to both related and unrelated dealers to determine whether the salesto related firms are arm's-length transactions which may be included inthe calculation of FMV.   Canon asserts that only a small percentage of home market sales were madeto related dealers and that the prices charged were within the range ofprices charged to unrelated large dealers; therefore, there is no justisficationfor excluding the related party transactions from the calulation of foreignmarket value.    <T3>Department's Position:</T3> We have made the comparison suggested bySCM, and, as a result, we have excluded sales to related parties from thecalculation of FMV for these final results. We found that the selling pricesto Canon's related customers were consistently lower than those to itsunrelated customers, and therefore we are not satisfied that these saleswere arm's-length transactions. <T3>Comment 22: </T3>SCM argues that Canon's method of adjusting the salesdatabase to account for negative invoices is unreliable and distorts theprices of reported sales. It argues that Canon's attempt to ``match' thenegative and positive invoices on a first in-first out (``FIFO'') basisis flawed and that the database is unverifiable. Therefore, the foreignmarket value should be based on the original prices quoted, without anadjustment for negative invoices. Canon asserts that because the information necessary to match negativeand positive invoices was not computerized, it developed a computer methodologybased on a FIFO system. Furthermore, Canon maintains that this methodologywas approved in discussions with Department personnel and was subject toextensive verification by the Department. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Contrary to SCM's assertion that the totalquantity and value of Canon's reported sales could not be verified becauseof the negative invoices, the Department was able to verify the accuracyof the net sales results. The verifier noted that, although correspondingsales and invoices were not chosen on the basis of identical matches, ``therewas no effect for the purpose of reporting complete and accurate salesinformation.'' Canon's computerized matching system was discussed withDepartment staff prior to the submission of the questionnaire response,and verification confirmed that the system resulted in accurately reportedsales prices and quantities. In its comments, SCM refers to the total quantityand sales value reported by Canon and the ``discrepancy'' noted in theverification report. However, further reading of the report indicates thatthe ``variance in question was resolved'' and that Canon reported boththe total quantity and value of initial sales, total quantity and valueof negative-invoiced units, and total final quantity and value of unitssold. Given the results of the verification, there is no justificationfor rejecting Canon's database as unreliable. <T3>Comment 23: </T3>SCM argues that Canon's home market sales listingis incomplete because it excludes sales of Japanese-language PETs and PETsincorporating calculators or text memory functions. Canon maintains that it included in its response a listing of all PETssold in the home market and the United States, as well as specificationsheets and brochures for all PET models. In accordance with the final resultsof the Department's most recent review in this case (52 FR 1504, January14, 1987), in which the Department determined that typewriters incorporatingcalculators or text memory functions were not covered by the scope of theantidumping order, this review was limited to four typewriter models soldto the United States. Canon maintains the Department had all of the informationnecessary to determine which home market sales models were most appropriatefor comparison purposes, and the selections should not be revised for thefinal results. Canon states that it does not produce ``Japanese-languageportable electric typewriters'' and that the two models to which SCM refers,the CM-3 and CM-5, are Japanese word processors not subject to this review.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree with Canon and note that the Departmentdecided, based on information provided by Canon at the outset of this proceeding,which home market models would be appropriately compared to the U.S. models.Since Canon had adequate sales of comparable models that fall within thescope of the order, it was not necessary to look to merchandise outsidethe scope for comparisons. <T3>Comment 24: </T3>SCM argues that repair expenses incurred on merchandisenot under warranty cannot be allocated to home market sales or deductedfrom FMV. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Based on the results of verification ofCanon records for the review period, we are satisfied that the warrantyexpense reported did not include expenses for warranty-expired PETs orfor anyother products. <T3>Comment 24: </T3>SCM argues that Canon's verified home market warrantycosts should be allocated over all Japanese sales rather than just theTokyo Division sales. Typewriters sold by any of Canon's divisions couldhave been repaired by Canon dealers in any part of Japan, and those dealerscould have submitted the warranty claims to the Tokyo Division. Canon maintains that is warranty claim was verified and that there is noevidence suggesting that PETs not sold by the Tokyo division were servicedby that division. The Tokyo Division warranty expenses are incurred asa result of services performed by this division for PETs sold by this division.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The figures reported by Canon were verified,and SCM has presented no evidence to substantiate its claim. <T3>Comment 26: </T3>SCM argues that Canon's claimed advertising expensesfor brochures/flyers, posters, price lists, trade shows, and golf tournamentsponsorship cannot be directly attributed to home market resales of PETsby Canon's customers. Therefore, the Department should disallow the claimedadvertising expenses adjustment. It contends that brochures, posters, andprice lists are commonly distributed by a manufacturer to its own customers,particularly in a situation in which the manufacturer has recently enteredthe typewriter market. SCM further contends that Canon failed to establish that the products displayedand advertised for its sponsorship ot the golf tournament included typewriters,much less the particular models subject to this review proceeding. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>Certain of Canon's advertisements, includingsuch items as brochures, and newspaper, magazine and catalogue advertisements,were directed to Canon's customers' customers, and were related to thePET models under review. Therefore, an adjustment for direct selling expenseswas appropriately made. Expenses incurred for trade shows, billboards,and sponsorship of a golf tournament, which were allocated on the basisof relative sales value, were for corporate/institutional advertising;therefore, we treated them as indirect selling expenses.We verified Canon's advertising expenses. Canon does not account for itsadvertising expenses on a model-by-model basis. Canon had all advertisingvouchers and 90 percent of all original advertisements available for theDepartment's inspection. The results of Canon's vertification confirm thatreported claims were accurate.<T3>Comment 27: </T3>SCM argues that, on the basis of verification, thepromotional expenses incurred by Canon which consisted of ``assistancemoney'' to certain dealers with excess inventory and to part-time hiresfor sales on college campuses, and ``recruitment expenses'' for the part-timehires, do not qualify as direct selling expenses. Even if the expenseswere incurred on Canon's customers' behalf, they must also be directlyrelated to sales of PETs; otherwise the adjustment should be denied.Canon states that the funds were used to finance sales expansion campaignsdesigned to increase the dealers' sales to end-users and were paid pursuantto contractual arrangements designed to promote the sale of specific typewritermodels. A circumstance-of-sale adjustment should be made for these expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Section 353.15(b) of the Commerce Regulationsprovides, as an example of an allowable direct expense, assumption of apurchaser's selling costs. Payment of the purchaser's sales personnel issuch an assumption. We do not interpret this allowance as limited to onlyan assumption of the direct selling expenses. Therefore, we allowed forthese payments as a circumstance-of-sale adjustment.<T3>Comment 28: </T3>SCM argues that the after-sale rebates and discountsreported by Canon cannot be relied upon because Canon routinely deviatedfrom the terms of the sale contracts. Therefore, the rebates and discountscannot be directly related to the sales under consideration and shouldbe rejected as direct adjustments to FMV. At most, these claims shouldbe treated as indirect expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We examined Canon's rebate contracts atverification and determined that the rebates were known at the time ofsale and were contingent upon the sales of particular models; therefore,these rebates were tied to the sales under consideration. Canon resubmitteddata concerning rebates on a sale-by-sale basis in accordance with theDepartment's request. We are satisfied that Canon's revised rebate submissionwas an accurate reflection of actual rebates paid and have allowed thededuction. The terms of the discounts were also examined at verificationand no discrepancies were found. Therefore, we made deductions from FMVfor both discounts and rebates.<T3>Comment 29: </T3>SCM claims that the difference in merchandise adjustmentfor one Canon comparison model, the S-15, was not fully verified. In particular,the Department did not examine the actual costs of Canon's subsidiary inmanufacturing the model S-15, nor did it compare prices paid by Canon tounrelated suppliers for assembly with transfer prices paid to the subsidiary.Absent such verification, the difference-in-merchandise adjustment mustbe based on the best information otherwise available.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree with Canon and are satisfied thatCanon reported actual production costs for the major components and thatthe verified labor and overhead costs for the model S-15 were accurate.Source documents from Canon's related subsidiary responsible for the mainassembly of the S-15 were examined and no discrepancies were discoveredin the reported amounts. We confirmed that all parts for both the S-15and S-55 were purchased from unrelated companies.<T3>Comment 30: </T3>SCM argues that all of Canon's U.S. export-relatedexpenses incurred in Japan must be stripped out of the home market sellingexpenses and deducted from ESP. It maintains that the cost of advertisingmaterials, hosting of the ``Tokyo Seminars,'' and the ``computerized partswarehouses'' are attributable to export sales and should be deducted fromUSP rather than allocated to home market sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Cost incurred for the brochure and pricelists printed in Japan were deducted as direct selling expenses from theU.S. sales price and there is nothing to indicate that these expenses havealso been deducted from FMV. Canon properly included expenses incurredfor hosting seminars in its corporate overhead claim. Furthermore, Canondid not include the cost of providing warranty parts for export sales inthe home market warranty expenses.<T3>Comment 31: </T3>SCM argues that Canon's method of matching negativeand positive invoices for its U.S. sales is unreliable. In cases of priceprotection, the Department should consider the lower price reported tobe the correct one for use in the calculation of USP. (Price protectionis a practice by which a manufacturer/seller reimburses it customer forthe revenues lost by the latter due to a decrease in the price list priceof merchandise in the customer's inventory at the time of the price listchange.)<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The method Canon used in applying negativeto positive invoices is reasonable. We verified that the methodology wascorrectly applied. See our response to Comment 22 concerning negative invoicesin the home market.<T3>Comment 32: </T3>SCM argues that Canon's allocation of U.S. warrantyand technical expenses is improper because it is based on the number ofrepairs of typewriters relative to the number of all repairs made by theCalculator Service Department. The Department should allocate the entireamount of warranty and technical service expenses only over U.S. typewritersales, not over all sales of the Calculator Service Department.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We found at verification that the unitrepair expenses for other products in the Calculator Service Departmentwere approximately the same as the unit costs reported for PETs. We aresatisfied that the figures submitted are a reasonable reflection of actualrepair costs incurred by Canon on sales of its PETs.<T3>Comment 33: </T3>SCM argues that, due to the inaccuracies in Canon'scategorization of U.S. advertising expenses, the Department should treatall such expenses as direct selling expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>At verification Canon was asked to resubmitits information concerning promotional materials and advertising expenses.This was necessary due to the miscategorization of these items in its originalreponse. As stated in the verification report, the actual amounts wereverified. However, the individual expense items were miscategorized. Canonprovided supporting documentation for its claim. We are satisfied thatall information is now accurate and have made the adjustments accordingly.<T3>Comment 34: </T3>SCM argues that Nakajima's production cost data shouldbe rejected for each of the review periods for the following reasons: (1)Nakajima cost data for the already completed 1981-82 review failed verification;(2) verification is virtually impossible given Nakajima's lack of a validcost accounting system; and (3) the 1985-86 verification was flawed invarious respects.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>SCM's assertion that we should reject Nakajima'scost information for this review based on verification results of a previousreview is not justified. Each review proceeding and administrative recordstands independently from that of prior reviews. We are satisfied withthe results of the cost of production verification for the 1985-86 reviewperiod. Nakajima's performance in prior verifications is not relevant inview of verification of the current period.<T3>Comment 35: </T3>SCM argues that Nakajima's cost calculation methodologywas not valid because Nakajima did not develop costs from the logs of machinetime, or allocate overhead or depreciation on the basis of machine time.Therefore, the Department's verification of work-in-process and fabricationcosts was flawed.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We are satisfied with Nakajima's calculationof fabrication costs. Nakajima's allocation of overhead was appropriatelybased on direct labor cost. The development and allocation of Nakajima'sfabrication costs were traced to source documents and verified as accurate.<T3>Comment 36: </T3>SCM argues that, because the Department failed toseek time-and-motion studies from Nakajima, it has no means to independentlytest the accuracy of Nakajima's labor cost.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>The Department did not require Nakajimato submit these studies because, as stated in the verification report,we examined actual labor costs. Time and motion studies are relevant onlyto standard times and costs, which we did not use.<T3>Comment 37: </T3>SCM argues that the Department's verification of directlabor hours was further flawed because: (1) The Department failed to verifythe composition of work groups that Nakajima assigned to direct labor pools;(2) the allocation of overhead to product line on the basis of direct laborcost does not produce a model-specific cost of production; and (3) Nakajimaomitted payroll taxes and overtime from its direct labor cost.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. We did, in fact, examine thecomposition of work groups at verification. The allocation of factory overheadby product line was reasonable for Nakajima All Precision Co., Ltd. (``Precision'')and Nakajima All Denshi Industrial Co. (``Denshi''), the only two membersof the Nakajima group for which such allocation was done, because the operationsperformed by Precision and Denshi vary little among models. Finally, payrolltaxes and overtime were included in Nakajima's reported direct labor costs.<T3>Comment 38:</T3> SCM argues that Nakajima's factory overhead expensesand depreciation, both of which are allocated to product lines on the basisof direct labor costs, are unreliable. SCM maintains that (1) pooling ofdepreciation expenses across product lines is inappropriate because ofvarying capacity utilization rates and useful lives, and (2) allocationof depreciation should be based on machine hours.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We are satisfied that Nakajima's allocationmethodology for both factory overhead and depreciation as verified is reasonable.<T3>Comment 39:</T3> SCM argues that the Department's reliance upon theconsolidated financial statement for companies within the Nakajima group,which reported cost of production rather than transfer prices tested againstarm's length market prices, may understate the cost Nakajima incurred inpurchasing parts and processing services.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. Because profit withn the Nakajimagroup is not an issue in calculating cost of production, we consider useof the actual costs incurred by related suppliers or subcontractors tobe appropriate. <T3>See Red Raspberries from Canada</T3> (53 FR 20150, June 2, 1988).<T3>Comment 40:</T3> SCM argues that Nakajima understated its cost of productionby consolidating subcontractors' SGandamp;A with its own SGandamp;A, ratherthan treating those subcontractor expenses as Nakajima's material, labor,or factory overhead. Furthermore, since Nakajima has an incentive to misallocateexpenses to achieve the statutory minimum, absent verification of subcontractors'costs, the Department cannot assume correct reporting and allocation.In addition, Nakajima included indirect labor in its reported SGandamp;Aexpenses, and may have also included depreciation on machinery and equipmentused in the manufacture of PETs.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. The verification report showsthat there was an extensive examination of the line items that comprisedSGandamp;A. Costs incurred were tied to the questionnaire response througha consolidated financial statement which took into account the cost ofmaterials and services as they were initially incurred by each of Nakajima'srelated subcontractors. Each line item expense was extracted from sourcedocuments of each of Nakajima's related subcontractors. Worksheets wereprovided and sample transactions from each subcontractor's general ledgerwere examined. We concluded that Nakajima properly classified and tookinto account the SGandamp;A expenses of each member of the Nakajima group.<T3>Comment 41:</T3> SCM argues that Nakajima's use of the last transactionvalue of the month, rather than a monthly weighted-average, to value inventory,is distortive. Therefore, the Department should use, as the best informationavailable for parts cost, the highest single value found for each part.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The Department verified that end-of-monthinventory valuations accurately represented the value of inventory duringthe month. Nakajima uses end-of-month inventory valuation in its normalrecord-keeping, in accordance with Japanese generally accepted accountingprinciples (``GAAP''). Therefore, we accept the parts cost reported byNakajima.<T3>Comment 42:</T3> SCM argues that Nakajima's scrap loss was not reportedin its accounting system.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We verified that the costs due to scraploss were added to the material costs reported by Nakajima.<T3>Comment 43:</T3> SCM argues that scrap costs were not accounted forin subcontractors' invoice prices to Precision. Because Nakajima's consolidatedfinancial statement took into account only the costs of inputs purchasedfrom related parties, the cost of waste, scrap, and defective parts thatwould have been captured in the transfer prices from related subcontractorsto Precision were eliminated from Nakajima's calculated cost of production.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Nakajima fully accounted for subcontractorscrap loss. The verified loss-ratio figure took into consideration theloss of parts transferred to subcontractors for assembly.<T3>Comment 44:</T3> SCM notes an apparent inconsistency between Nakajima'sresponse and the verification report with respect to transportation costsbetween related subcontractors for materials transportation. SCM contendsthat these transportation costs should be included in material costs. Becauseit appears that such costs have not been attributed to materials costs,the Department should use the best information available to value materials.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>There is no inconsistency between the responseand verification report with respect to this issue. The section in theverification report that SCM cites refers to materials purchased from relatedsubcontractors, while the response refers to purchases from unrelated parties.Nakajima's categorization of the costs of salaried drivers and of vehiclesfor such transportation as overhead expenses was reasonable.<T3>Comment 45:</T3> SCM argues that Nakajima made unwarranted deductionsfrom its reported SGandamp;A for export selling expenses and the SGandamp;Aof Precision.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>This expense item was verified. The expensesrelated to Nakajima's export sales have been properly allocated to SGandamp;A.<T3>Comment 46: </T3>SCM argues that Nakajima failed to allocate corporateRandamp;D and Randamp;D incurred by subdivisions to the product under investigation.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Nakajima's Randamp;D expensesincurred for the products under review were included in the manufacturingoverhead costs of these products and those associated with future productswere appropriately classified as general Randamp;D and included in SGandamp;Aexpenses. This is supported by the verfication report which indicates thatactual costs were reflected in the financial statement and allocated toelectric typewriters and printers. The methodology used to account forthese costs is fully explained in the report and is consistent with bothU.S. and Japanese Generally Accepted Accounting Principles.<T3>Comment 47: </T3>SCM argues that Nakajima's cost data for the 1982-85review periods be rejected as unreliable because it was not verified.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. SCM requested verificationof Nakajima's submitted information for only the 1985-86 review periodbased on the understanding that if problems were found for this periodthe Department would then verify data from the earlier review periods aswell. The Department is satisfied with the results of the 1985-86 periodverification. There is no basis for rejecting Nakajima's submitted dataand using the best information available for the 1982-85 review periods.<T3>Comment 48: </T3>SCM contends that Silver's data of sale in the UnitedStates is unreliable because the Department found at verification that,in many instances, the payment amounts did not correspond to the invoices,and only through the tracing of off-invoice discounts could Silver reconcilepayment amounts to invoices and substantiate the accuracy of the sale pricesreported. Therefore, the Department should, as the best information available,assume that price protection was granted on every U.S. sale.Silver states that most of the ``discrepancies'' found in the reportedsales data were instances in which the amounts received by Silver ReedAmerica (``SRA'') were greater than the amounts reported because separatechecks were not received for each invoice, but a combined payment for severalinvoices were instead made.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree with Silver that in most instancesin which the payment amounts differed from invoice amounts, payments weregreater than invoice amounts. SCM's assertion that sale prices reportedcould only be confirmed through tracing of discounts is not supported byevidence on the record. On a few sales traced at verification, discountswere granted to Silver's customers. We verified the amounts of the discountsand confirmed that the actual prices paid were reported.<T3>Comment 49: </T3>SCM argues that model-specific advertising expensesincurred with respect to U.S. sales may have been improperly treated asindirect expenses. It maintains that the advertisements classified as institutionalshould be examined to ensure they have been properly categorized as indirect,given SRA's incentive to understate direct U.S. selling costs.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>At verification we examined samples ofthe advertisements claimed to be institutional, and confirmed that theywere properly categorized as such.<T3>Comment 50: </T3>SCM contends that the averaging of credit costs doesnot reasonably reflect Silver's costs associated with promotional periodsales. It maintains that credit costs should be computed on a transactionalor a seasonal basis, or at a minimum by customer.Silver emphasizes that SRA does not maintain an ongoing record of eachcustomer's accounts receivable payment profile and the burden of measuringthe exact time period between shipment and payment for the thousands ofindividual payments would be unreasonable.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree with Silver. The reporting ofcredit expenses based on monthly accounts receivables adequately reflectsexperience during promotional periods. Reporting on a customer-by-customerbasis, as petitioner suggests, would not take into account such seasonalfluctuations.<T3>Comment 51: </T3>SCM argues that Silver's claim for deduct-from-invoice(``DFI'') discounts submitted after verification cannot be relied upon.The Department should calculate the deduction based upon the highest DFIdiscounts given, as the best information available, and make deductionsfor all sales to each eligible dealer.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>Silver originally erred in reporting, asdirect deductions from U.S. price, deductions that were actually indirect,thereby understating the net USP. This error, which was to Silver's disadvantage,was revealed at verification. Due to the overstatement of direct sellingexpenses, we allowed Silver to resubmit its claim for this expense. Theactual amounts were verified and Silver was required to submit all invoicesfor inspection. We have continued to make an adjustment for Silver's DFIdiscounts for the final results.<T3>Comment 52:</T3> SCM argues that expenses incurred by SRA for its cashdisbursement payments to customers should be treated as direct rather thanindirect selling expenses, since of the two allegedly indirect advertisementsexamined at verification, one was found to be direct.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> SCM is mistaken. We verified that Silvercorrectly classified portions of its cash disbursement payments as directexpenses and other portions as indirect expenses. For these final results,as for the preliminary results, we have treated these expenses as director indirect, as appropriate.<T3>Comment 53:</T3> SCM alleges that Silver did not identify any expensesfor providing point-of-sale materials or other promotional programs forthe U.S. market, and that these expenses must therefore have been improperlyreported as indirect expenses. Consequently, the entire category of corporateadvertising should be treated as a direct selling expense.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> SCM provides no support specific to Silverfor its contention that such expenses were incurred and were improperlyreported. Furthermore, questions regarding the adequacy of a response shouldbe raised prior to verification. In the interest of timeliness the Departmentwill not investigate unsupported allegations regarding the accuracy ofa response subsequent to verification.<T3>Comment 54:</T3> SCM contends the Department should make a deductionfor commissions paid by Silver in the United States to salaried salesmenbecause such commissions were directly releated to specific sales of themerchandise.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Silver reported, and the Department deductedfrom USP, all commissions for sales to the U.S.<T3>Comment 55:</T3> SCM argues that technical service costs should betreated as direct selling expenses for newly introduced typewriter models,because it is likely that model-specific repair training was provided.Furthermore, based on the verification report, it appears that the indirectexpenses were claimed on the basis of a line item listing of expenses bymodel. Therefore, a direct deduction should be made on a model-by-modelbasis. If model-specific data is not available, the technical service expenseamount should be allocated to all typewriter sales and treated as a directexpense.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The line-item listing by model does notshow itemized expense amounts incurred on a model-by-model basis, but ratherindicates the total expense amounts allocated to each model. Petitioner'sspeculation regarding the likelihood of model-specific training is nota sufficient reason to reclassify the expenses as direct.<T3>Comment 56:</T3> SCM argues that Silver's purchase price customersmust have demanded, as a condition of sale, that Silver warehouse PETsin the United States. Such warehousing is directly related to specificsales of PETs and should be deducted from USP as a direct expense.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree with the petitioner that suchan expense for post-sale warehousing would be taken as a direct deductionfrom the USP. However, we have no evidence that Silver incurred such expenses.<T3>Comment 57:</T3> SCM argues that Silver's home market sales databasecannot be relied upon because Silver could not account for the effect ofnegative invoices on individual sales. At a minimum, the negative lineitems should be dropped from the home market database.Silver maintains that the negative invoices reported were returns of previoussales which have been properly disregarded from the calculations, and thatall home market sales were reported.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> As in the preliminary, we have disregardedall negative invoices in the final result calculations and are satisfiedthat these were issued as the result of returned mechandise.<T3>Comment 58:</T3> SCM argues that Silver's home market database is incompletebecause Silver did not report sales of Japanese-language PETs or PETs whichincorporate calculators or text memory.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We are satisfied that Silver reported homemarket sales of all non-automatic PETs not incorporating a calculatingmechanism, in accordance with the Department's request. Japanese languagePETs or PETS which incorporate calculators or text memory would be lesssimilar to the U.S. models being reviewed, and thus, even if reported,not used to determine FMV. See our discussion of the scope in the backgroundsection.<T3>Comment 59: </T3>SCM argues that the Department should not allow anadjustment for rebates in the home market because they were neither shownto have been a condition of sale, nor proven to be directly related tothe sales under consideration. At most, the adjustment should be permittedas an indirect selling expense.Silver contends that the rebates paid to its customers were provided forin contracts which specify both the amounts of and the conditions for therebates. Furthermore, in a previous review, rebates of this same type weredetermined to be directly related to the sales of the merchandise underinvestigation.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree with Silver and have continuedto deduct rebates paid for the final results. Silver provided various agreementsand supporting documents at verification indicating the rebates were knownat the time of sale and applied to the sales under consideration.<T3>Comment 60:</T3> SCM alleges that Silver's reported warranty costsare overstated because they include costs incurred for periods other thanthose subject to this review.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree with petitioner. Because the warrantyexpense amount incurred for the review period has not been separately quantified,we have denied this adjustment for these final results.<T3>Comment 61:</T3> SCM states that it is not clear whether Silver's differencein merchandise adjustments include SGandamp;A expenses; if so, they shouldbe adjusted to reflect only variable manufacturing costs.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> The difference in merchandise adjustmentfigures reflect only the variable manufacturing costs and do not includeSGandamp;A expenses.<T3>Comment 62:</T3> SCM argues that, consistent with past agency practiceand the method employed for other respondents in this review proceeding,the Department should deduct from Silver's total home market freight expensethe pre-sale costs of freight from the factory to distribution centers.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree with petitioner and have accordinglyreduced the deduction.<T3>Comment 63:</T3> SCM argues that Silver improperly included headquarters'SGandamp;A expenses in its indirect selling expense claim, because it isthe Department's practice to allow an adjustment for indirect expensesonly when indirect expenses are incurred by a sales subsidiary.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Silver Business Machine is responsiblefor the marketing of PETs in the home market. The expense item was properlyallocated from Silver Business Machine (``SBM'') to total sales of PETs,based o the ratio of the number of employees in SBM to the number of employeesin the headquarters operation. As a general rule we do not allow allocationof headquarters' SGandamp;A to home market indirect selling expenses unlessthe respondent can demonstrate actual expenses incurred by the sellingoperation. <T3>See Television Receivers, Monochrome and Color, from Korea</T3> (49FR 50420, December 28, 1984). We are satisfied that Silver adequately demonstratedthe actual expenses incurred by SBM and we have made the appropriate allocation.<T3>Comment 64:</T3> SCM argues that Silver overstated its indirect sellingexpenses in the home market by failing to deduct credit costs associatedwith export sales from the pool of home market indirect expenses.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We disagree. Credit costs associated withU.S. export sales were not included in the indirect selling expenses inthe home market.<T3>Comment 65:</T3> SCM notes that the Department properly declined tomake a direct selling expense deduction from FMV for home market technicalservice expenses, as Silver failed to demonstrate that they were directlyrelated to the sales under consideration. However, the Department shouldensure that these expenses have not been improperly categorized as indirectselling expenses.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> There is no evidence to indicate that technicalservice expenses have been improperly included in Silver's indirect sellingexpense claims.<T3>Comment 66:</T3> SCM argues that unless Silver's Business Machine Divisionis involved in the marketing of PETs, expenses, incurred by this divisionshould be excluded from the amount of indirect selling expenses in thehome market.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> Silver's Business Machine Division is involvedin the marketing of PETs and, therefore, a portion of expenses incurredby this division are attributable to sales of PETs.<T3>Comment 67:</T3> SCM contends the Department neglected to investigatewhether Juki granted seasonal price reductions for its U.S. sales similarto the price protections offered by other respondents.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We are satisfied with Juki's contentionthat no such rebates were paid to its customers, and SCM has not submittedevidence to the contrary with regard to Juki. There is no justificationfor simply assuming such a program existed.<T3>Comment 68:</T3> SCM agrees that Juki's U.S. selling expenses wereproperly deducted as direct selling expenses from ESP. However, it statesthat information in the record is insufficient to determine if the amountincluded warranty and technical service expenses, and how these were allocatedamong different products.Juki confirms that warranty and technical service expenses were includedin the U.S. selling expenses as reported, and a detailed explanation withworksheets was provided to demonstrate that they were properly allocatedamong the different product groups sold by Juki Office Machine Corporation.<T3>Department's Position:</T3> We have continued to deduct Juki's U.S.selling expenses as a direct expense from ESP for the final results, andare satisfied with Juki's explanation and worksheets, submitted in March1987, detailing the allocation methodology.<T3>Comment 69: </T3>SCM states that the Department should ensure thatJuki's U.S. co-op advertising expenses are not commingled with indirectexpenses. Furthermore, since Juki claimed it was unable to identify co-opadvertising on a customer-specific basis, and because Juki was known tohave incurred co-op advertising expenses in the amount of three percentof the selling price, the Department should deduct three percent from allsales for co-op advertising as a direct selling expense, and make the necessaryadjustments to the direct and indirect selling expense totals for the co-opadvertising expenses.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We are satisfied that the advertising expenseshave been properly reported for the 1985-86 period.<T3>Comment 70: </T3>SCM argues that the Department should make a deductionfrom Juki's USP for promotional trips as a direct selling expense.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. SCM provided no evidence thatJuki incurred promotional trip expenses during the review period.<T3>Comment 71: </T3>SCM questions Juki's assertion that typewriters areshipped immediately upon sale, and argues that the cost of warehousingin the United States should be based on the warehousing period used forthe imputed credit cost calculation. The warehousing cost should be deductedfrom each U.S. sale as an indirect selling expense.Juki maintains that the Department deducted from each U.S. sale an imputedamount for interest expenses, including the warehousing period expenses,as an indirect selling expense.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have continued to make the appropriatededuction for the imputed interest expenses incurred by Juki for the warehousingperiod as an indirect expense for the final results.<T3>Comment 72: </T3>SCM argues that the highest monthly interest rate,rather than the average of monthly rates incurred during the review period,should be used to calculate U.S. credit expenses. A simple average doesnot provide the necessary level of detail to insure that U.S. credit expenseshave not been understated. Furthermore, based on information that SCM submitted,Juki offered terms as long as ninety days or a seven percent discount.Absent evidence to support Juki's ``actual'' credit period, SCM proposesthat the Department assume seven percent discounts were granted on allsales of Juki's PETs.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We consider the twelve-month average usedfor the preliminary calculations reasonable because it is representativeof the monthly rates for the period. We used the actual terms of paymentfor each sale, and have continued to make a deduction for early paymentdiscounts actually incurred. There is no reason to assume discounts weregranted beyond the terms of each of the sales in question. Further, wenote that information regarding terms and discounts provided by SCM isfrom outside the review period.<T3>Comment 73: </T3>SCM argues that Juki's submitted cost data is unreliablebecause the allocation of variances for labor and materials is based onproduction quantities and the allocation of corporate SGandamp;A is doneon the basis of number of employees. It further argues that various plant-levelexpenses were improperly classified as SGandamp;A expenses rather than factoryoverhead. Finally, general Randamp;D expenses should be included in the costof production and allocated to factory overhead and SGandamp;A.Juki argues that the production cost data was supported by worksheets,and the allocation methods were the same as those submitted in responsesfor earlier reviews which were verified as accurate. It maintains the corporateSGandamp;A expenses, allocated on the basis of number of employees at theGeneral Affairs Division, is reasonable and in accordance with GAAP. Jukistates that no factory overhead expenses were improperly classified asSGandamp;A and the data submitted includes product-specific and general Randamp;D.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We consider Juki's allocation methodologyreasonable and, as in the prior review, accept Juki's costs as submittedin accordance with that methodology.<T3>Comment 74: </T3>SCM argues that, contrary to the Department's statementin the preliminary that Matsushita had no sales of merchandise within thescope of the order during the review period, three models of typewriterssold by Matsushita (the KX-E400, KX-E500, and KX-E500B) are included inthe scope of the antidumping duty order. Since there is disagreement asto the application of the order to these models, the Department shouldsuspend liquidation of these models and rule on Matsushita's exclusionrequest.Matsushita asserts that these three models are office typewriters, andbased on their physical characteristics are properly excluded from thescope of the order. It maintains that all three models are non-portable,not sold with a handle or carrying case, and are more durable than thetypical PET. Furthermore, it states that they are sold exclusively throughOEDs, and are wider and deeper than the models included under the scope.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: The Department will issue a determination,separate from these final results, as to whether the KX-E400, KX-E500,and KX-E500B are included in the scope of the antidumping duty order. Ifwe determine that any of these models are included in the scope, we willseparately review Panasonic's unliquidated entries of those models forthe May 1, 1985 through April 30, 1986 period.<T3>Comment 75</T3>: SMC argues that, contrary to the Department's March18, 1988 revised scope determination submitted to the Court of InternationalTrade, PETs with text memory capability of 2K or more (``automatic typewriters'')are covered by the scope of the antidumping duty order.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: The merchandise subject to this reviewis defined as non-automatic portable electric typewriters not incorporatinga calculating mechanism, in accordance with the scope of the order as statedin the most recently published final results of administrative review.For a further discussion, see the background section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Respondents' Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 76</T3>: Brother objects to the retroactive application ofthe section 615 changes of the 1984 Act to merchandise exported prior toOctober 30, 1984, the effective date of the 1984 Act. This provision changedthe point in time at which FMV is calculated for ESP transactions. TheDepartment's decision to apply the change retroactively caused certainof Brother's U.S. sales to lack comparison sales of such or similar merchandisein the home market. Brother does not object to the use of sale date forcalculating FMVs for all shipments exported after October 30, 1984. However,Brother objects to the retroactive application of the section 615 changesto merchandise exported prior to this date.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: We disagree with Brother and have basedexchange rate calculations and home market comparison sale selections forsales date rather than export date. This is consistent with the Depatment'spractice in conducting administrative reviews which were initiated afterand covered sales prior to October 30, 1984. The initiation notices ofantidumping duty administrative review for the periods subject to thisreview were published on June 23, 1986 and July 9, 1986. Also, the useof sale date rather than export date is consisitent with the final resultsof the administrative review of this case covering the 1981-82 period (52FR 1504, January 14, 1987).<T3>Comment 77</T3>: Brother asserts that it did not compare a home marketmanual typewriter with any electric export PET models despite the statementin the Department's analysis memorandum which suggests that Brother mixedmanual and electric model typewriters for comparison.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: We acknowledge that the word ``manual''in the analysis memorandum should read ``electro-mechanical,'' and recognizethat no manual typewriters were suggested by Brother for use as home marketcomparision models.<T3>Comment 78</T3>: Brother argues that, because of the distinction betweenelectro-mechanical PETs and electronic PETs, it would be inappropriateto compare the electro-mechanical models sold in the United States witha more advanced electronic model sold in the home market. For those U.S.sales of electro-mechanical models that Brother suggested be compared withthe New Porta-8, the Department should not use the best information otherwiseavailable, but rather consider the New Porta-8 a comparable model. It assertsthat, in terms of production costs, the New Porta-8 is more comparableto the U.S. models in question than are any of the other home market modelssuggested by Brother as alternatives.Furthermore, Brother objects to the Department's application of the highestmargin found on any one sale during the relevant review period to all U.S.sales of models determined by the Department not to have a comparable homemarket sale model.SCM contends that the Department was correct in rejecting Brother's modelmatch selections for certain U.S. model PETs because section 771(c) definessimilar merchandise in terms of merchandise which is approximately equalin commercial value and merchandise which the Department determines maybe reasonably compared.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: We have reconsidered our position withrespect to those U.S. models previously determined not to have home marketcomparisons. In determining whether a home market model is similar to aparticular U.S. model, we took into consideration the physical characteristicsof both models, as well as a comparison of direct production costs. Ifthe difference in direct production costs was too great, then we did notconsider the home market model similar for comparison purposes. The costinformation used in this analysis was provided in Brother's April 18, 1988constructed value submission.Subsequent to the preliminary results notice and based on comments received,we reviewed the constructed value submission to determine if Brother'soriginal home market model selections could be accepted as comparisons.With three exceptions, the U.S. models in question can be considered comparableto the New Porta-8, as suggested by Brother, based on physical characteristicsand differences in direct costs. For the other three U.S. models, the XL80,the XL20+3, and L10+3, we used constructed value for FMV, based on thecost information provided by Brother. Since we considered the April 18,1988 submission in determining whether particular home market models arecomparable to certain U.S. models, we also determined it appropriate touse the constructed value information as a basis for FMV for the threeremaining U.S. sales models that did not have similar home market comparisonmodels, rather than apply a best information available rate to sales ofthese three models.<T3>Comment 79</T3>: Brother argues that the Department inappropriatelydeemed its constructed value submission untimely, given the extent of informationrequested involving numerous typewriter models and review periods. Furthermore,it notes that the Department requested additional information from Brotherconcerning another expense, thus causing delays in the submission of theconstructed value information. Therefore, rejection of the constructedvalue submission as ``untimely'' is unreasonable.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>As stated above, we considered Brother'sconstructed value submission for the purpose of determining whether homemarket model selections were comparable to the U.S. models based on thedifference in direct production costs, as well as for calculating constructedvalues for the three models for which we found no sales of such or similarmerchandise in the home market. Although the submission was late and theDepartment was not required to use it, it was reasonable to do so becauseBrother was originally given a short period of time to respond to our requestfor constructed value data, while at the same time responding to otherDepartment requests for information. Furthermore, we had used the submissionin determining the suitability of Brother's proposed home market modelmatches; see our response to Comment 76.<T3>Comment 80: </T3>Brother argues that the deduction from ESP of an imputedcredit expense, for the period from the date of sale to the date of payment,and imputed interest, for the period from the date of export to the dateof sale to the first unrelated customer, is illegal and improper. Evenassuming <T3>arguendo </T3>the propriety of deducting these imputed costs, the additionaldeduction of actual interest expenses represents a double deduction ofcredit cost. Brother maintains that the actual credit expenses should beallocated over all sales during the period, and the imputed inventory carryingcost deduction should be made in the FMV calculations as well as in inthe USP calculations.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We continue to deduct an imputed creditexpense and imputed inventory carrying cost in the ESP calculations. Deductionsfor imputed costs were upheld in <T3>Silver Reed America, Inc. v. United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-37 (March18, 1988), and are consistent with the Department's practice as seen inthe <T3>Final Results of Administrative Review of Color Television Receiversfrom Korea </T3>(51 FR 41365, November 14, 1986). Further, Brother's contentionthat the deduction for actual credit expenses represents a double deductionis in error. The long-term expenses allegedly incurred by Brother to financeinventory are not attributable to the specific sales under consideration.We have not made an adjustment for imputed inventory carrying costs inthe home market because Brother made no such claim nor is there informationin the record to quantify such an adjustment.<T3>Comment 81: </T3>Brother requests that the Department recalculate itsU.S. warranty expense deduction, differentiating between the fixed andvariable cost components, and treating the labor and other fixed costsas indirect rather than direct expenses. Furthermore, it argues that theindirect costs calculated should be added to BIC's other indirect costs,increasing the ESP cap.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree with Brother. We have separatedBIC's claimed warranty expense into fixed and variable components, andhave made the requested adjustments to direct and indirect costs for thefinal results.<T3>Comment 82: </T3>Brother argues that the Department failed to increasethe ESP offset by the amount of commissions paid in the U.S. market. Wherea commission is paid in the U.S. market, the ESP offset should be increasedby the amount that such commission exceeds the home market commission.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree with Brother. Direct commissionexpenses incurred in both markets were properly adjusted. Only where nocommission (not a lower commission) is paid in one market will allowancebe made for indirect expenses up to the amount of the commission in theother market.<T3>Comment 83: </T3>Brother argues that the Department neglected to deductBrother's period rebate in the FMV calculations for 1984-85 and 1985-86.Also, for the 1985-86 period, an incorrect credit expense was deductedin the FMV calculations.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have corrected Brother's credit andrebate adjustments for the applicable review periods and have made theappropriate adjustments to FMV for the final results.<T3>Comment 84: </T3>Brother argues that because negative invoices werea result of erroneous input data, the Department should revise the preliminaryresults and include the negative invoices in the FMV calculations. At aminimum, Brother requests that the Department correlate the negative invoicesto the positive invoices and factor them into the FMV calculations.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>For the final results we have excludedboth the negative and the corresponding positive invoices from the calculations.Review of the positive sales transactions which Brother intended to offsetwith negative invoices reveals obvious computer input errors, and, therefore,these positive and negative invoices were excluded from the analysis.<T3>Comment 85: </T3>Canon argues that the Department should treat expensesfor freight to regional warehouses in both the U.S. and home markets asdirect expenses. It maintains that, like the freight expenses for shipmentto U.S. warehouses, the shipment costs in the home market represent a variableexpense directly attributable to Canon Sales Company's (``CSC's'') subsequentsales of the merchandise.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We have disallowed the deduction from homemarket prices for the cost of shipment from Canon's central warehouse toregional warehouses as a direct expense because the cost was not attributableto specific sales under consideration, consistent with <T3>Silver Reed America Inc. v. United States, </T3>7 CIT 23, 581 F.Supp.1,290 (CIT 1984).<T3>Comment 86:</T3> Canon argues that, based upon prior practice, theDepartment should deduct an imputed interest expense from Canon's homemarket sales. The expense should include costs for financing during shipmentfrom Canon Inc.'s central warehouse to CSC's regional warehouses, and inventorycarrying costs at the CSC regional warehouses. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> We agree that such expenses are appropriateadjustments to FMV. However, Canon failed to identify and quantify theexpense items until after the preliminary results; therefore, we have disallowedthe claim. <T3>See Large Power Transformers from Japan </T3>(51 FR 21197, June 11,1986). <T3>Comment 87:</T3> Canon argues that because the model S-15 was not introduceduntil late in the review period, its warranty experience during 1985-86understates the actual warranty costs eventually incurred by the company.Therefore, as the best information available, the Department should applythe warranty costs associated with sales of the Typestar 5 model to theS-15 models sold in Japan. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> Canon claimed a warranty expenses deductionfor the model S-15 in its response based on actual costs incurred. DespiteCanon's contention that this figure is low, its claim that we should imputethe warranty costs for another model to the S-15 is inappropriate whenthe actual costs are available and have been verified. If we were to includefuture costs that were not yet incurred during the period, the possibilityexists that such costs will also be considered in the subsequent reviewand therefore allowed as a deduction twice. Moreover, we cannot assumethat the warranty experience for the S-15 will be similar to that for theTypestar 5. We have deducted only the actual warranty costs incurred forthis model during the review period. <T3>Comment 88:</T3> Canon argues that Canon U.S.A.'s inventory clearancesales should be excluded from the analysis for the final results becausethe did not constitute a significant portion of the company's total U.S.PET sales during the 1985-86 period. Alternatively, if the sales are inlcuded,the Department should make a circumstance-of-sale adjustment to FMV toreflect the difference between the lowest wholesale prices on its ConsumerTypewriter Price List for Typestar 5 and Typestar 50X machines and CanonU.S.A.'s special closeout prices. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> We continue to include the sales at theirreduced prices in the calculations. Canon's reduced prices were offeredonly on the beige-and-white Typestar 5 models. Color appears to be theonly difference between the ``outdated'' models and the new models notsold at discount. We will not ignore the U.S. sales of these typewritersbased on their obsolescence. As the Department determined in <T3>Certain Internal-Combustion Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan</T3>(53 FR 12552, April 15, 1988), ``the physical characteristics and functionsof these models do not differ significantly from the models being producedand sold under a new model number.'' Furthermore, there is no provisonin the regulations for a circumstance-of-sale adjustment due to inventoryclearance sales, and no support on the record for quantifying such an adjustment.<T3>Comment 89:</T3> Canon argues that costs incurred by Canon U.S.A. inselling sample demonstration models typewriters at a discount to independentsales representatives are direct selling expenses that should be allocatedover all of the company's U.S. sales on a model-by-model basis. <T3>Department's Position:</T3> Canon's reliance on <T3>Cyanuric Acid and its Chlorinated Derivatives from Japan</T3> (51 FR45495, 1986), where we determined that ``free samples'' to home marketcustomers who had already purchased a significant quantity could be treatedas a selling expense, is misplaced. Canon's situation is different in thatthese sample typewriters were entered into the United States for consumptionand ownership was transferred from the exporter. Our determination is consistentwith <T3>Television Receiving Sets, Monochrome and Color, from Japan</T3> (50FR 24278, 1985), where it was determined that sales to employees and salesrepresentatives are transfers of ownership and should be included in theanalysis. Therefore, we have continued to treat these sample sales as sales,rather than as a circumstance-of-sale adjustment.<T3>Comment 90:</T3> Nakajima disagrees with the methodology the Departmentused to calculate FMVs for comparison with U.S. sales to two of its customers.In these instances, rather than compare a U.S. sale with a third-countrysale to a customer related to the U.S. customer, the Department excludedsales to that third-country customer in its calcualtion of FMV. Nakajimaasserts that the Department has no authority for such an exclusion pendingfurther investigation, and argues that it is unfair for the Deaprtmentto apply, on a retroactive basis, a new methodology unsupported by authorityin the statute or regulations. SCM supports the position taken by the Department's preliminary results.SCM points out that the existence of related customers in different countriesraises the possibility of transshipments. Furthermore, it asserts thatthe Department should send questionnaires to each of these customers becauseit may be appropriate to use the resale prices from Nakajima's third-countrycustomers to the first unrelated purchasers as the basis for FMV, in accordancewith section 773(f) of the Tariff Act. <T3>Department's Position</T3>: Nakajima has submitted information clarifyingthe nature of the sales transactions in question. Nakajima produces PETs(for shipment to the U.S. and other markets) pursuant to contracts withcertain unrelated third-country customers. Those customers then resellthe product to related firms in the United States and elsewhere. Nakajimaknows at the time that the contracts are negotiated the destination ofthe units it will produce. For these final results, we have determined not to exclude from the calculationof FMV Nakajima's sales to the third-country customers, if those saleswere destined for the third-country market. Rather, we have based the FMVson all Nakajima sales into the third-country market or markets, as applicable.Similarly, we continue to base USP on Nakajima's prices to the third-countrycustomers for shipment to the United States. This approach is consistentwith our normal practice of determining USP and FMV when the seller knowsthe ultimate destination of the merchandise at the time of the sale toan unrelated party. <T3>See, Certain Forged Crankshafts from Japan</T3> (52 FR 36984, October2, 1984) and <T3>Nylon Impression Fabric from Japan</T3> (51 FR 15816, April 2, 1987).<T3>See also, The Trade Agreement Act of 1979, Report on H.R. 4537 by theCommittee on Finance, United States Senate,</T3> 96th Cong., 1st Sess.94 (1979). We are not now convinced that we should change this practice,even given the relationship between the third-country customer and theU.S. purchaser. We have no evidence that PETs manufactured by Nakajima and destined forthe United States have been transshipped through third countries. <T3>Comment 91</T3>: Nakajima argues that the FMVs should be based on salesto one third country, in accordance with andSection; 353.5(c) of the Commerceregulations, rather than on an aggregate of sales to numerous third countries.It maintains that the Department should base FMVs for each period on salesto the third country with the largest volume of sales because those salesrepresent a truer measure of pricing policies than do sales of lesser quantitiesto other third countries. Nakajima maintains that the Department may aggregatesales to other third countries only if the single third country with thelargest volume of sales of the product at issue in a month that is withinthe six-month time period contemporaneous with the date of the U.S. saledoes not provide an adequate sample. Nakajima contends that the Department'sdecision to aggregate all markets for comparison in order to find contemporaneoussales for comparison to U.S. sales is improper and results in comparisonsof large volume U.S. sales at reduce prices to third-country market salesof lesser quantities. <T3>Department's Position</T3>: For the final results we first attemptedto match all U.S. sales with contemporaneous sales of such or similar modelsin the third-country market with the largest sales volume. After this step,for all remaining U.S. sales for which no contemporaneous sale of suchor similar merchandise existed in that market, we attempted to match theU.S. sale with sales of such or similar merchandise in the aggregate ofall other third-country markets. This was necessitated by the time constraintsimposed by the Court of International Trade. Any use of a smaller poolof third-country sales, even if desirable, would not have been possible,since we would not have had time to keep enlarging the pool until matchesfor all U.S. sales had been found. For all those U.S. sales of models thatwe were still unable to match with third-country sales, we calculated aconstructed value as the basis of FMV. The aggregate of all third country markets for FMV comparison is allowedpursuant to andSection; 353.5(d) of the Commerce Regulations, which states:``if such sales to a single country selected * * * do not provide an adequatesample, sales to additional countries selected * * * may be aggregated.''Nakajima improperly relies on this section of the regulations to arguethat the Department is obligated to consider the quantities of individualsales in determining whether they are adequate to be used in comparisonwith the U.S. sales. Section 353.5(d) discusses overall adequacy of themarket, and not comparability of quantities of individual U.S. and third-countrysales. Furthermore, although Nakajima complains of our comparison of largequantity U.S. sales with small quantity third-country sales, we note thatsales to both markets were made in a wide range of quantities. <T3>Comment 92</T3>: Nakajima argues that the Department failed to adjustfor third-country credit expenses and packing costs. <T3>Department's Position</T3>: In most instances, Nakajima's narrativesubmission with respect to these expenses does not correspond with thevalues submitted on its computer tapes. It is not the Department's responsibilityto correct faulty data submitted by the respondent. Where the failure toadjust for either expense was discovered to be the Department's error wemade the appropriate correction. However, we have not altered any dataprovided by Nakajima in any of its tapes submitted for any review period.<T3>Comment 93</T3>: Nakajima argues that in the Department's calculationof constructed value an adjustment must be made for differences in merchandiseand differences in packing. <T3>Department's Position</T3>: We disagree. The Department calculatedthe constructed values using direct production costs and packing costsof the U.S. models for those U.S. sales that could not be matched withsales in the third countries; therefore; there is no basis for differencein merchandise or difference in packing adjustments. <T3>Comment 94: </T3>Nakajima identifies computer input errors concerningcertain typewriter models, negative numbers, currency conversions and differencesin merchandise values for each review period and requests that changesbe made prior to the final results. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The clerical errors are primarily the resultof errors in the computer tapes submitted by Nakajima. In many instancesNakajima's narrative submissions did not correspond with the computer tapesit submitted. As stated in our response to Comment 90, when the error isin the Department's analysis rather than the result of faulty data providedby Nakajima, the appropriate corrections have been made for the final results.<T3>Comment 95: </T3>Nakajima argues that the Department should base thedifference in merchandise adjustments for the 1985-86 review period onthe difference in production costs at the time of the U.S. sale. Nakajimaasserts that the cost of certain components should be determined as ofthe date of the U.S. sale, rather than the date of reporting. It maintainsthat only on this basis can it monitor selling prices to the United Statesand third countries to ensure that its USPs are at not less than FMV. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The constructed value provision of thestatute requires that the cost of materials and fabrication be determined``at a time preceding the date of exportation of the merchandise underconsideration which would ordinarily permit the production of that particularmerchandise in the ordinary course of business'' (19 U.S.C. 1677b(e)(1)(A)).There is no provision for the reduction in the cost of components solelybecause of a decline in prevailing market prices. <T3>Comment 96: </T3>Silver argues the Department improperly used the originaldifference in merchandise figures submitted rather than the revised figuressubmitted for the 1985-86 review period, and requests that this be correctedfor the final results. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree and the change is reflected inthe final results. <T3>Comment 97: </T3>Silver argues that Department's methodology of deductingselling expenses incurred in the home market from the home market priceand selling expenses incurred in the United States from USP is inconsistentwith the CIT's ruling in <T3>Timken Co. v. United States. </T3>Slip Op. 87-118, 673 F. Supp. 495(CIT 1987). In that case, the Court decided that in ESP situations theadjustment for direct selling expenses can only be made to FMV. It requeststhat all adjustments for its selling expenses be made as additions to ordeductions from home market price, and that no deductions be made fromUSP. Petitioner argues that the <T3>Timken </T3>Court erred in ruling that adjustments for selling pricesshould be made to the prices in the market in which the selling expensewas incurred. Because the statute makes no distinction between direct andindirect selling expenses, it is proper to deduct all selling expenses(direct or indirect) from ESP, pursuant to sections 772 (d) and (e) ofthe Tariff Act. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree with Silver. The Departmentcontinues to make deductions, as appropriate, from both the U.S. and homemarket prices, pursuant to sections 772 and 773 of the Tariff Act. The<T3>Timken </T3>decision is not yet final. <T3>Comment 98: </T3>Silver argues that as a basis for FMV the Departmentshould consider only sales to the two largest retail outlets in Japan,which obtain special discounted prices, because these two customers accountedfor more than 20 percent of Silver's total volume of home market sales.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>This argument was raised by Silver in the1981-82 administrative review. As indicated in the final notice for thatreview, andSection; 353.14 of the Commerce regulations deals with the grantingof quantity discounts and does not apply here, where different categoriesof customers purchase different quantities but where there is no establishedpolicy for granting discounts across the board. <T3>Comment 99: </T3>Silver argues that, contrary to the ruling in <T3>Silver Reed America v. United States, </T3>Slip Op. 88-37 (March 18,1988), on the following two issues, the department should (1) deduct fromU.S. and home market prices the actual interest expenses incurred ratherthan the imputed interest costs, and (2) adjust the home market pricesfor differences in production runs.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. As the Court observed in <T3>Silver Reed,</T3> ``if ITA were precluded from deducting this imputedinterest expenses from the ESP, the essential price comparison to determinethe margin of dumping, if any, becomes distorted and contrary to the purposeof the dumping law to achieve a fair price comparison.'' Slip Op. at p.9. Also, with respect to the claimed adjustment for differences in pricesattributable to different quantities produced for sale in the U.S. andhome markets, as stated in our response to Silver's claim in the previousreview, ``the adjustment cannot be allowed since it is not based on quantificablephysical differences in the products produced for the two comparison markets.''<T3>Comment 100</T3>: Towa argues that the Department should have calculatedforeign market value on the basis of its sales to unrelated parties inthird countries rather than apply the highest rate for a responding firmduring the period to its sales as the best information available. It arguesthat there is a preference for using third-country sales for the calculationof foreign market value in the absence of home market sales of the merchandise.The Department should not have disregarded the third-country sales informationthat was submitted. Towa contends that there were substantial sales tounrelated parties in third countries and that complete and timely informationwas submitted to the Department. Therefore, the Department should not havesought constructed value information.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: We have revised our decision for the finalresults and have calculated a margin based on the comparison between Towa'sU.S. sale prices and Towa's third-country sale prices. The best informationavailable, the highest rate determined to exist for a responding firm duringthe review period, was applied to Towa's U.S. sales for the preliminarybecause Towa failed to respond to our request for constructed value information.However, we have determined that FMV was appropriately based on Towa'ssales to third countries.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Results of the Review</ITAG>As a result of the comments received and the correction of clerical errors,we determine that, the following margins exists:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,b2,tp0,i1,s10,20,6</C> <H1/><T3>Manufacturer/exporter</T3><H1/><T3>Time period</T3><H1/><T3>Margin (percent)</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">Brother Industries, Ltd<D>05/21/82 to 05/20/83</D><D>0.62</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>05/21/83 to 05/20/84</D><D>0.32</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>05/21/84 to 04/30/85</D><D>0.44</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>05/01/85 to 04/30/86</D><D>4.00</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Canon, Inc.<D>05/01/85 to 04/30/86</D><D>5.51</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Nakajima All Co., Ltd<D>05/01/82 to 04/30/83</D><D>0.01</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>05/01/83 to 04/30/84</D><D>0.34</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>05/01/84 to 04/30/85</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>05/01/85 to 04/30/86</D><D>0</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Silver Seiko, Ltd<D>04/01/82 to 03/31/83</D><D>0.06</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>04/01/83 to 03/31/84</D><D>0.67</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>04/01/84 to 04/30/85</D><D>5.20</D><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG><D>05/01/85 to 04/30/86</D><D>8.85</D><ITAG tagnum="1">Tokyo Juki Industrial Co., Ltd<D>05/01/85 to 04/30/86</D><D>2.40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Towa Sankiden Corp<D>05/01/85 to 04/30/86</D><D>1.41</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Panasonic (Matsushita)<D>05/01/85 to 04/30/86</D><D>\1\ 4.92</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Fujitsu, Ltd<D>05/01/85 to 04/30/86</D><D>\1\ 5.20</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Tokyo Electric Co., Ltd<D>05/01/85 to 04/30/86</D><D>\1\ 4.92</D><F>\1\ No shipments during the review period.
