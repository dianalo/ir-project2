The study in the New England Journal of Medicine found that theolder drug streptokinase is just as good as TPA, or tissueplasminogen activator, at preserving the heart after a heart attack.   ``Because the allocation of scarce health resources is a causeof concern,'' the report concluded, ``the lower cost ofstreptokinase is an important factor in its favor.''   In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Elliot Rapaport said onetreatment of streptokinase costs $78 at San Francisco GeneralHospital, while TPA costs $2,268.   Earlier research showed that both drugs break up clots thatblock the heart arteries, and both can significantly reduce thechances of death if given quickly after a heart attack. However,many experts assumed that the newer drug, TPA, was better.   Several studies have examined the merits of the two treatments.The authors of the latest work said theirs is the first to comparethem head-to-head in people treated during the first three hours ofheart attacks, the period during which medicines have the bestchance of saving the heart.   The report concluded that the health of the left ventricle, themain pumping chamber of the heart, was the same regardless of whichmedicine the patients got.   The study was conducted by Dr. Harvey D. White and colleaguesfrom Green Lane Hospital in Auckland, New Zealand. It involved 270heart attack patients who were ramdomly assigned to receive one ofthe two medicines.   After nine months, 6 percent of the TPA patients and 9 percentof the streptokinase patients had died. However, the researcherssaid the number of people treated was too small to determinewhether there is a true difference in the death rate.</TEXT></DOC>
