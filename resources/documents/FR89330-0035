The Departmenthas now completed that administrative review in accordance with section751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``the Tariff Act''). <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the United States fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule(HTS), as provided for in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade andCompetitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn fromwarehouse, for consumption on or after that date is now classified solelyaccording to the appropriate HTS item number(s). Imports covered by the review are shipments of porcelain-on-steel cookingware from Mexico. The products are procelain-on-steel cooking ware (exceptteakettles), which do not have self-contained electric heating units. Allof the foregoing are constructed of steel. During the review period, suchmerchandise was classifiable under item number 654.0818 of the Tariff Schedulesof the United States Annotated. These products are currently classifiableunder HTS item number 7323.94.00.20. The HTS item numbers are providedfor convenience and Customs purposes. The written description remains dispositive.The review covers the period from March 7, 1986 through December 31, 1987and 11 programs. In calculating the benefit from FOMEX export loans in our preliminary results,we failed to convert the value of porcelain-on-steel cooking ware exportsfrom pesos to U.S. dollars. After adjusting our calculations accordingly,we determine the FOMEX export loan benefit to be 1.56 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for 1986 and 1.1 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for 1987, and the total benefit to be 5.16 percent<T3>ad valorem </T3>for 1986 and 2.89 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for 1987. We gave interested parties an opportunity to comment on the preliminaryresults. We received written comments from the respondents, Troqueles YEsmaltes, S.A. (``TRES''), and CINSA, S.A., and from the petitioner, GeneralHousewares Corp. (``GHC''). <T3>Comment 1: </T3>The respondents contend that the Department used animproper benchmark to measure the countervailable benefit from FOMEX exportloans. The Department's benchmark is based on lending rates for short-termloans of less than $25,000, as published in the <T3>Federal Reserve Bulletin. </T3>Because most FOMEX export loans takenout by the exporters during the period of review were in excess of $25,000,the Department should base its benchmark on lending rates applicable tothe actual sums borrowed. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The benchmark used to measure the subsidyconferred by FOMEX export loans is based on the annual average of commercialbank fixed lending rates for short-term loans under $1,000,000, as publishedin the <T3>Federal Reserve Bulletin. </T3>The exporters borrowed sums rangingfrom approximately $10,000 to $500,000. Therefore, we believe our benchmarkis appropriate. <T3>Comment 2: </T3>The respondents claim that the Department overstatedTRES' net benefit from FONEI. During the review period, TRES made sevenpayments on a FONEI loan. No payment on principal was made. Rather, eachpayment consisted of a portion of the interest due on the outstanding balance.The portion of interest due on the outstanding balance. The portion ofinterest that was not paid was converted to principal. Thus, the interestdue on the subsequent payment date was based on the previous outstandingbalance plus capitalized interest from the previous period. However, forthe last payment due during the review period, the Department incorrectlyincluded the capitalized portion of the interest due for the present payment,an amount for which interest would not fall due until the subsequent paymentdate. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>We agree. We have corrected our calculationand determine the benefit conferred by the FONEI loans to be 0.42 percent<T3>ad valorem </T3>for 1987 and 0.17 percent <T3>ad valorem </T3>for 1986. <T3>Comment 3: </T3>The petitioner argues that the Department's benchmarkfor calculating the benefit from peso-denominated loans understates thebenefit from those loans. The peso loan benchmark is based in part on anaverage of the difference between an average of the monthly effective interestrates published in <T3>Indicadores Economicos </T3>and monthly Costo Porcentual Promedio (``CPP'')rates for the years 1981-1984. The petitioner contends that this methodologyunderstates the impact of recent inflation on interest rates in Mexico.Inflation would not only cause both rates to increase, but would increasethe absolute spread between the two rates. The petitioner argues that abenchmark based in part on an average of the <T3>ratio </T3>of the average monthly effective interest rates and averagemonthly CPP rates for the years 1981-1984, rather than on the absolutedifference between the two, would better incorporate the effects of inflationon interest rates in Mexico and therefore be a more accurate reflectionof the benefit. <T3>Department's Position: </T3>The petitioner has not adequately proventhat the proposed methodology will more accurately predict the effectiveinterest rate than the Department's methodology. We note that in the highinflation years of 1981-1984, the CPP rates, which are deposit rates, rosefaster than the I.E. effective rates, which are lending rates. This seemsto indicate that inflation does not necessarily affect both rates equally.In addition, interest rates are affected by factors other than inflation,such as perceived risk and the supply and demand for money.Between 1981 and 1984, the average CPP rate increased by 80 percent, whilethe average I.E. effective rate increased by 62 percent, which means thatthe relative spread between the two rates decreased in this period. Moreover,the absolute spread between the I.E. effective rate and the CPP rate decreasedfrom 1981 to 1984. This contradicts the petitioner's assertion that thespread would increase as the rates increase.To test the petitioner's hypothesis, we constructed two different ``benchmarks''for the period in which the actual effective interest rates are available(1981-1984). In one exercise, we added the absolute spread that we haveused in our benchmark to the average CPP rates in each year between 1981and 1984. In the other exercise, we added the relative spread that thepetitioner proposes to the average CPP rates in the same years. We comparedthe results of both exercises with the actual, published effective ratesfor the years 1981-1984. On average, our methodology more accurately predictedthe effective interest rates for those years.Between 1984 and 1987, the CPP rates rose at roughly the same rate as inthe 1981-1984 period. The CPP rates increased about 85 percent between1984 and 1987, while in the 1981-1984 period, the CPP rates increased about80 percent. Because the absolute spread between the CPP rates and the effectiverates did not increase in the earlier period, when the CPP rates were increasingat approximately the same rate as in the later period, there is no reasonto expect a dramatic increase in the spread in the later period.Although we do not believe that the petitioner's suggested change is unreasonable,the petitioner has not provided enough information to show that the proposedmethod is more accurate than our method. We recognize that there are shortcomingsin our current methodology and are seeking, for future reviews, a betterbenchmark by which to measure the benefits conferred by the preferentialloans granted to Mexican exporters. We invite comments from all partieson this issue. For this review, however, we believe that our current benchmarkis the most accurate information available.<T3>Comment 4: </T3>The petitioner argues that it is ``unfair'' for therespondents to avoid provisional measures in a countervailing duty investigationby extending the final determination in the corresponding antidumping investigationof the same product. Because the petitioner previously had requested thatthe Department extend the final determination in this case to coincidewith the final antidumping determination pursuant to section 705(a)(1)of the Tariff Act, the respondents' extension of the final antidumpingdetermination further postponed the final countervailing duty determination.Partly as a result of this extension, the Department directed the U.S.Customs Service to terminate the suspension of liquidation on the subjectmerchandise during the period between July 5, 1986, the 120th day afterthe initial suspension of liquidation, and December 12, 1986, the dateof publication of the countervailing duty order (the ``gap period'').The petitioner contends that, despite the absence of provisional measuresduring this period, the Department should direct the U.S. Customs Serviceto assess countervailing duties for entries or withdrawals of the subjectmerchandise made during this period. The petitioner contends that the Departmenthas the legal authority to do so because the U.S. Customs Service has notyet liquidated most of the entries or withdrawals made during this periodbecause of the suspension of liquidation in effect for the antidumpingduty order covering the same product. The petitioner further contends thatnothing in the relevant U.S. statutes, the Department's regulations, orthe GATT Subsidies Code prohibits the Department from directing the U.S.Customs Service to collect countervailing duties during the gap period.<T3>Department's Position: </T3>We disagree. Under section 705(a)(1) ofthe Tariff Act, as amended by section 606 of the Trade and Tariff Act of1984 (the ``1984 Trade Act''), the Department is proscribed from imposingprovisional measures (<T3>i.e., </T3>cash deposits, bonds, and assessment of duties) for a periodgreater than 120 days in the absence of a countervailing duty order. Accordingly,the Department directed the U.S. Customs Service to terminate the suspensionof liquidation in this case on July 5, 1986, the 120th day after the preliminarydetermination and the initial suspension of liquidation.This 120-day statutory proscription stems from Article 5, paragraph 3,of the Agreement on Interpretation and Application of Articles VI, XVI,and XXIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (``GATT SubsidiesCode'') which requires that ``[t]he imposition of provisional measures. . . be limited to as short a duration as possible, not exceeding fourmonths.'' One of the stated goals of Congress in enacting the Trade AgreementsAct of 1979, as well as the 1984 Trade Act, was to conform U.S. trade lawswith the GATT Subsidies Code and Antidumping Code. <T3>See </T3>S. Rep. No. 249, 96th Cong., 1st Sess. 36, 38-39 (1979); <T3>see also </T3>H.R. Rep. No. 725, 98th Cong., 2nd Sess. 5 (1984). Asa consequence, we have consistently interpreted section 705(a)(1) of theAct in accordance with Article 5, paragraph 3, of the GATT Subsidies Code.The Court of International Trade (``CIT'') has upheld this interpretation.<T3>See U.S. Steel Corp. </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>618 F. Supp. 496 (CIT 1985); <T3>appeal dismissed, </T3>792 F.2d 1101 (Fed. Cir 1986).The Department has recently codified this 120-day limit on provisionalmeasures in the final countervailing duty regulations published in the<T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 27, 1988. The relevant language providesin pertinent part:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * [i]f the Secretary simultaneously initiated antidumping andcountervailing duty investigations . . . the secretary will:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(i) At the petitioner's request, postpone the final [countervailingduty] determination . . .; and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) If the Secretary postpones the final [countervailing duty] determination,<T3>end any suspension of liquidation ordered in the preliminary determinationnot later than 120 days after the date of publication of the preliminarydetermination,</T3> and not resume it unless and until the Secretary publishesa countervailing duty order.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">53 FR 52306, 52353 (Dec. 27, 1988) (to be codified at 19 CFR 355.20(c))(emphasis added).</ITAG>We also disagree with the petitioner's contention that the suspension ofliquidation in effect for purposes of assessing antidumping duties authoriziesthe Department to direct the U.S. Customs Service to assess countervailingduties during the gap period.The authority that the Department invokes to suspend liquidation for purposesof assessing countervailing duties is independent from that to suspendliquidation for purposes of assessing antidumping duties. Suspension forpurposes of assessing antidumping duties has no legal effect on suspensionfor purposes of assessing countervailing duties. Thus, regardless of whethersuspension of liquidation was in effect for purposes of assessing antidumpingduties during the gap period, such suspension does not authorize the Departmentto assess countervailing duties during that period.Finally, we disagree with the petitioner's argument that it was ``unfair''for the Department to terminate provisional countervailing duty measuresin this case. When the petitioner requested an extension of the deadlineof the final countervailing duty determination, the petitioner should haveknown that provisional measures would cease on July 5, 1986. That datemarked the 120th day from the date of publication of the preliminary countervailingduty determination and the original suspension of liquidation; July 28,1986, was the original deadline date of the final determination in theconcurrent antidumping investigation. Moreover, the Department did nothave the legal authority to resume such suspension until the Departmenthad published the countervailing duty order covering the subject merchandiseon December 12, 1986. Hence, it was the respondents' request to postponethe final antidumping investigation that caused the termination of suspensionof liquidation, but rather the petitioner's original request to extendthe final countervailing duty determination. The respondents' postponementmerely extended the period during which provisional countervailing dutymeasures would be unavailable.The petitioner's fairness argument is therefore disingenuous. By choosingto extend the deadline of the final countervailing duty determination,the petitioner chose the convenience of one consolidated countervailingduty and antidumping injury hearing at the International Trade Commission.Petitioner thus voluntarily selected the administrative benefit of consolidationin exchange for the gap in provisional measures.<T3>Comment 5:</T3> The petitioner argues that the preliminary cash depositrate underestimates the current benefit because the Department used themost recently available CPP rate (May 1988), which is substantially lowerthan the rates in the first few months of 1988. The petitioner argues thatthe Department should instead base the cash deposit rate on an averageof all the months in 1988 for which data are available.<T3>Department's Position</T3>: After further review, we find that therates in 1988 have been too volatile to measure accurately the currentbenefit from FOMEX pre-export loans. Therefore, we determine that, forpurposes of cash deposit of estimated countervailing duties, the benefitfor FOMEX is the same as the review period assessement rate, 2.47 percent.<T3>Final Results of Review:</T3> After reviewing all of the comments received,we determine the net subsidy to be 5.16 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for all companies during the period March 7, 1986 throughDecember 31, 1986. We determine the net subsidy to be 2.89 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3> for all companies during the period January 1, 1987through December 31, 1987.Section 707 of the Tariff Act provides that the difference between theamount of a cash deposit, or the amount of any bond or security, for anestimated countervailing duty and the duty determined under a countervailingduty order shall be disregarded to the extent that the estimated duty islower than the duty determined under the order which was published on December12, 1986. The rate in our preliminary determination (51 FR 7878, March7, 1986) was 2.29 percent <T3>ad valorem</T3>.In accordance with section 705(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, the final determinationin this case was extended to coincide with the final antidumping determinationon the same products from Mexico. Because we are precluded by statute fromimposing provisional measures for more than 120 days without the issuanceof a countervailing duty order, we terminated the suspension of liquidationfor entries or withdrawal made on or after July 5, 1986 and before December12, 1986, the date of publication of the countervailing duty order. Wereinstated suspension of liquidation and the requirement for collectionof estimated countervailing duties for entries or withdrawals of the subjectmerchandise made on or after the date of publication of the countervailingduty order, December 12, 1986.The Department will therefore instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailingduties of 2.29 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments ofthis merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after March 7, 1986 and on or before July 4, 1986. Entries or withdrawalsbetween July 5, 1986 and December 11, 1986 are not subject to countervailingduties. The Department will instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailingduties of 5.16 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments ofthis merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after December 12, 1986 and exported on or before December 31, 1986.We will also instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailing dutiesof 2.89 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments of this merchandiseexported on or after January 1, 1987 and on or before December 31, 1987.Further, as provided by section 751(a)(1) of the Tariff Act, the Departmentwill instruct the Customs Service to collect a cash deposit of estimatedcountervailing duties of 2.89 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on shipmentsfrom all firms entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption onor after the date of publication of this notice. This deposit requirementshall remain in effect until publication of the final results of the textadministrative review.This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and section 355.22 of the CommerceRegulations published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on December 27, and 1988 (53 FR 52306) (to becodified at 19 CFR 355.22).<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: March 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
