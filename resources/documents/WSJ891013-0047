In the agreement, GE denied government allegations that RCA Corp. intentionally concealed cost and pricing data and overcharged the government.    Investigators at the Defense and Justice departments determined that RCA, acquired by GE in 1987, submitted false and misleading pricing data to Army negotiators in a contract entered into in 1984. Investigators also determined that RCA negotiators concealed the existence of an internal document containing accurate cost data. As a result of the concealment, the Army was overcharged $450,000, it was alleged.    The $900,000 settlement represented a doubling of the Army's actual damages under terms of the federal False Claims Act. As part of the settlement, GE, with interests in electrical products, financial services and broadcasting, also agreed to implement certain policies and procedures at the facility where the adapters were manufactured, so that the situation leading to the investigation would not recur. </TEXT></DOC>
