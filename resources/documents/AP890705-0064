Now he feels a man betrayed _ betrayed by Chinese leader DengXiaoping, who ordered the killing of unarmed protesters in Beijing,and by the People's Liberation Army, who carried out the order.   Sitting in his ornate office, decorated with pillars covered ingold leaf and imitation French Renaissance furniture, Cha appears tobe a profoundly disturbed man.   ``I am very, very sad,'' he said in an interview. ``My hopes formy country _ to be strong, to have steady progress _ are weak now. Isee bad things in the future.''   Cha, 65, belongs to a large group of Chinese living overseas whofor decades have carried atorch of patriotism for their motherland.   Some sent back thousands of dollars for their families, othersdesigned buildings in China, still others returned to help thecountry's development. Cha, for his part, wrote.   From the early 1950s when he published his first novel, Cha haspumped out 36 volumes of rollicking Kung Fu adventures in ancientChina.   In addition, in the 30 years since he started the newspaper MingPao with four friends and the royalties from his successful novels,Cha has written hundreds of editorials on his country and on thefuture of the British colony of Hong Kong.   In that time, his paper has grown from two pages to about 42,from a gutsy voice of the patriotic opposition to one of the leadingintellectual Chinese-language papers in the world.   Cha, who is from the southern Chinese city of Hangzhou, began hislife as a journalist for Ta Kung Pao, a pro-Communist newspaper thenbased in Shanghai.   He left the mainland in 1948, a year before the communisttakeover, and came to Hong Kong to open the paper's office in theBritish colony.   Like many young Chinese of his generation, Cha supported thegoals of the Communists and worked to communicate them in the pagesof the party-backed paper.   But then came 1957 and with it China's first big politicalmovement, the anti-rightist campaign. Thousands of intellectualswere purged and imprisoned for criticizing the government.   ``I was disillusioned with the Communists distorting the truth,''he said. ``So I quit and started my own newspaper.'' In 1959, MingPao hit the stands.   In the 1960s, as China collapsed into the ultra-leftist CulturalRevolution, Cha opposed the campaigns against intellectuals andhigh-ranking cadres such as Deng and former head of government LiuShao-ch'i.   Communist-backed organizations in Hong Kong issued death threats.Several bombs were delivered to the paper although none went off.Cha was placed under police protection.   When Deng seized power in 1978 and announced a reform program toopen China to the outside world and develop its economy, Cha backedhim with all his editorial might.   Cha's usefulness to the Chinese government was heightened when,after a 23-year absence, he returned to the mainland in 1981 and metwith Deng, a fan of Cha's novels, and other top leaders.   During the early days of the student movement in April, Cha'spaper praised the government for not cracking down on the students.   But on May 20, martial law was ordered. Cha resigned from hispost on the Chinese legislature and sent letters of protest toBeijing, urging Deng to talk with the students.   On June 3-4, Cha stayed home with his wife and watched theaccount of the massacre on television.   A few days later, he appeared on local TV with tears in his eyesand condemned the violence.   ``Who could have expected that the magnificent ideals wouldvanish into thin air in less than one month?'' he wrote in aneditorial June 11. ``Is it that the encouragement we had and thebelief we held in the past ten or more years are nothing but anillusion, nothing but a fond dream?''   China began to criticize Cha's paper.   On July 1, the People's Daily scolded Ming Pao for``rumor-mongering.'' President Yang Shangkun called Cha ``an oldanti-communist,'' according to Cha.   Cha is not optimistic about the future. He has canceled plans toretire to Hangzhou and is considering leaving Hong Kong for anothercountry.   ``If I stay here after 1997, I am afraid they will settle theiraccounts with me and it will be dangerous,'' he said. ``I am worriedfor me and for my wife.''   As for his paper, Cha believes the communist takeover will seemore censorship, whether forced or self-imposed. And he fears forthe rest of Hong Kong as well.   ``Our fates are tied to one another now. As China goes, Hong Kongwill follow,'' he said.   And finally, Louis Cha fears for his motherland.   ``They have set my country back years by killing the beautifulold hundred names,'' he said using the Chinese expression for commonpeople. ``For that they should never be forgiven.''</TEXT></DOC>
