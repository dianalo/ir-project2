These exposures were followedby examination of a variety of immunologic responses and morphologicalstudies of tissue. There was a very severe reduction in the numbers ofantibody-forming cells in spleens and mediastinal lymph nodes after aerosoladministration of antigens. There was decreased phagocytic activity oflung macrophages and decreased lung clearance of inhaled bacteria. Therewas a decrease in the antigen processing ability of lung-derived macrophages,and a decreased response to antigens of spleen cells from silica-exposedanimals used to repopulate gamma-irradiated syngenetic recipients. Therewere progressive cellular changes into the lungs including early infiltrationof chronic inflammatory cells, followed by the development of silicacontaining macrophages and, after 39 weeks of exposure, the presenceof silica-associated fibrotic nodules both in the lungs and in the mediastinallymph nodes. It is concluded that mice exposed in the manner serve asexcellent models for further study of pathogenesis of diseases causedby inhalation of other toxic substances besides silica.</TEXT></DOC>
