Regardless of the outcome of the meeting, Service Resources may persist with its offer. If Pandick's board turns down the offer, &quot;we will consider going unfriendly,&quot; said Patrick J. Rooney, chairman of Service Resources.    Service Resources said it believes that arbitragers, who are believed to hold between 65% and 70% of Pandick's common shares, will opt for its higher offer.    Pandick's board already has approved an earlier $25.50-a-share, or $251 million, leveraged buyout proposal from certain Pandick executives. That offer is scheduled to end today. Service Resources has asked Pandick's board to postpone the close of the management offer to give investors a chance to consider the higher bid by its Charles P. Young andamp; Co. subsidiary.    Pandick and Young are financial printers. Service Resources provides back-office services for law firms, investment banks and other companies.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Pandick shares rose 12.5 cents, to $25.75.    Pandick has not disclosed the number of shares that have been tendered to the management group. The company said it has 9,853,290 shares outstanding.    Service Resources said Young has secured the financing to complete the acquisition. It said Young is in final negotiations with Trafalgar Holdings Inc., a Los Angeles-based investment company, for $150 million in senior bank financing.    The company said it also expects &quot;a highly confident letter&quot; that will constitute a commitment for $105 million of subordinated debt from McKinley Allsopp Inc., an investment subsidiary of Merchants Bank of Boston. The company said it still has a $25 million proposal for equity financing from one source and expects an additional $20 million from McKinley Allsopp.    Separately, Young has &quot;verbal commitments&quot; for about $4 million for equity participation from certain of its management and sales personnel, Service Resources said. It said it is prepared to offer the same package to important executives at Pandick who would stay on with the newly combined company if the takeover succeeds.    As previously reported, Service Resources said it will ask Edward G. Green, Pandick's chairman and chief executive officer, to head the combined financial printing operation that would be created in the acquisition. A high-ranking Service Resources official close to the negotiations said the company has not been able to talk directly to Mr. Green, who hasn't returned calls from Service Resources executives.    Mr. Green isn't part of the management group that is seeking to buy the company. Anthony K. Moulton, Pandick's president, is a part of that group, however. Mr. Moulton is Mr. Green's son-in-law. Neither could be reached for comment.    But following a meeting yesterday with Mr. Rooney, the Pandick buyout group, known as FP Acquisition Inc., said in a news release that it would press ahead with its bid. It said it had secured $220 million in financing for the offer from Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and Toronto-Dominion Bank. Rock Capital Partners LP, Morgan Capital Corp. and certain Pandick executives will provide as much as $65 million more in equity financing, the release said.    Service Resources had planned to sell Young last March. But the company now predicts that consolidating Young and Pandick could result in a 1987 operating profit that would exceed $80 million.    In the year ended Aug. 31, Pandick earned $8.2 million, or 92 cents a share, on sales of $230.8 million. Service Resources said it based its projections on savings that would result from consolidating the two companies and from the potential use of about $70 million in tax-loss carry-forwards available to Service Resources. </TEXT></DOC>
