Schiffman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> WPM FTL </CO><IN> TNM TEX BON </IN><TEXT>   West Point-Pepperell Inc. turned a cold shoulder to the $1.3 billion takeover bid by Chicago investor William Farley by urging shareholders to hold off tendering their stock until the board reviews the $48-a-share offer.    The textile giant said its board would meet by Nov. 4 and urged shareholders to wait for the directors' recommendation even though the offer began yesterday.    Executives of the West Point, Ga., company refused to comment further. But insiders and industry watchers said they believed that West Point's chairman and chief executive officer, Joseph L. Lanier Jr., will put up a fight.    &quot;He's not going to sit down and take it lying down. He's a pretty hard competitor,&quot; says Alan Davis, president of Bibb Co., a textile subsidiary of NTC Group Inc. Mr. Davis knows Mr. Lanier well since they both emerged as victors in a bloody takeover battle for West Point's archrival, J.P. Stevens andamp; Co., earlier this year that resulted in the carve-up of Stevens.    Wall Street didn't seem to think the battle was over, either. West Point shares climbed $4.75 to close at $50 in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. &quot;That says to me people are very much expecting West Point's management to come back and put together a package to shareholders that's going to be worth more than the $48,&quot; said Patricia L. Ryan, an analyst with Raymond James andamp; Associates Inc.    Several analysts said the value of West Point's assets could justify a sale in the over-$50-a-share range. &quot;The most I could get for this company is $53,&quot; said Deborah Bronston, an analyst with Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.    While a takeover attempt by Mr. Farley had been rumored for five months, the tender offer took analysts by surprise. And several said they believed West Point's management already has a good idea about how to counter Mr. Farley.    Some analysts said management might arrange a leveraged buy-out of its own. But others viewed that option as least likely because West Point already has almost $1 billion in debt from the Stevens acquisition. &quot;With the debt level that West Point has, an LBO would be difficult,&quot; says a source close to the company. &quot;But,&quot; he added, &quot;I'm not sure that means there isn't a possibility of an LBO.&quot;    Analysts said they believed management will also consider a company restructuring much like the defense Kraft Inc. is trying against Philip Morris Cos. In that case, Kraft developed a plan to sell some businesses and increase its debt load more than tenfold. Analysts said that West Point might borrow money and pay a special dividend or buy back shares at a premium. Such a restructuring could be coupled with sale of certain businesses, such as its Cluett Peabody andamp; Co. unit. Cluett, which makes Arrow shirts and Gold Toe socks, hasn't performed up to West Point's expectations since they acquired it in 1986. &quot;It's a business they clearly cannot get their hands around. That's the easy sale,&quot; says Grace Taferner, an analyst with First Manhattan Co.    Meanwhile, Standard and Poor's placed West Point's $80 million of senior debt on its CreditWatch list and said the securities could be downgraded if Mr. Farley's bid succeeds or if the company pursues expected measures to remain independent.    For his part, Mr. Farley said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that he intends to sell West Point's apparel, apparel fabrics and industrial fabrics lines. He would keep the company's sheet and towel lines, which are the crown jewels of company.    West Point's sheet and towel business is one of only a handful of efficient producers left in that business after an industry shakeout, industry experts said. As opposed to the labor-intensive apparel business, a sheet and towel plant can be run by a handful of workers, putting American producers at an advantage over foreign competitors who rely on cheaper labor to compete. Moreover, the sheet and towel business is considered fairly recession-proof and provides high profit margins.    In keeping the sheet and towel business, Mr. Farley would inherit West Point's Martex and Lady Pepperell brand names as well as the Utica and Tastemaker lines that originally were developed by Stevens. They could enhance his strategy of moving international. &quot;Bill Farley believes in branded products. He believes that the world is ready for a global marketing strategy,&quot; says Fernando Silva, a principal at Kurt Salmon Associates Inc., an Atlanta-based consulting concern.    The offer is being made through Farley Inc., which said no agreements have been made with any parties to buy the assets it plans to sell. Mr. Farley controls Farley Inc. He is also chairman of Fruit of the Loom Inc.    Farley said that the asset sales would take place during the first two years following the merger and would be used to make required payments on debt incurred to finance the merger.    Even if Mr. Farley fails in his takeover bid, he still could come out enriched. In recent months, when West Point's stock was trading in the $30s and low $40s, he accumulated 2.87 million West Point shares, or 9.8% of the company, according to the SEC filing. If his $48 offer is topped, &quot;he'll make a lot of money on the stock. He's looking at it where he can't lose,&quot; said Mr. Davis of Bibb. </TEXT></DOC>
