(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Buddy Roemer is trying to uprootdecades of populist political tradition and restructure Louisiana'stax system in a test that may be a barometer of his politicalfuture.   Opposing him are anti-tax lawmakers, including former Ku KluxKlan leader David Duke, and a tradition of making business pay thebulk of the bills.   Roemer says the state must lighten the tax burden on business tocreate new jobs and get away from dependence on the petroleumindustry.   An April 29 referendum is scheduled on a proposed constitutionalamendment authorizing the Legislature to make basic changes in thetax structure. A new tax code approved by legislators during aspecial session in late February and early March will take effectif the amendment is approved.   The Legislature convened Monday for its 85-day regular session,but no major action is expected until after the election, whenlawmakers will have an idea of how much money will be available.   Roemer wants a combination of personal income tax increases,sales tax decreases and business tax breaks, along with a $1.5billion improvement program for highways, airports and ports to befunded by a net increase in gasoline taxes of about 1 cent pergallon.   Taxes on cigarettes and wine would go up. The plan also includesa new balanced-budget measure in the state constitution and a trustfund that would set aside mineral revenue should oil prices boomagain.   The proposed changes chop at the roots of a populist tax systemthat began evolving during the 1930s. Now, homesteads valued at$75,000 are exempt from parish property taxes, businesses pay 95percent of property taxes and annual auto license plate fees are $3.   Petroleum companies have historically footed much of the billfor state programs through severance taxes and leases on state land.   In the early 1980s, oil and gas revenue amounted to more than 40percent of the total state budget and the good times rolled inLouisiana. But when prices fell and production was curtailed, thestate was thrown into one budget crisis after another. The statenow gets only 20 percent of its revenue from petroleum.   Opponents claim Roemer's plan constitutes a $621 million taxincrease that will guarantee nothing for the state's economy,plagued by the nation's highest unemployment rate at more than 11percent.   A recent statewide poll by Mason-Dixon Public Research indicatedthat voters were about evenly split among support, opposition andindecision.   The total state budget is about $7.7 billion. If the taxrevision plan passes, Roemer says $234 million in reductions willbe needed to balance the budget. Without the plan, an additional$485 million will have to be cut from the budget.   The governor says he's too busy trying to rally public supportfor his tax plan to worry about possible political implications.   ``I'm not in this to be safe, to sit at home and say, `Well, youknow I couldn't try it because it's too risky,''' Roemer said.   But Rep. Allen Bradley, a supporter of the tax plan, said thepackage is ``clearly a Buddy Roemer tax package and, in a way, itbecomes a referendum on the governor.''   On the other side is Duke, elected in February on an anti-taxplank.   ``He (Roemer) has said it will not hurt citizens on the lowerend of the income scale, but the increases will actually begin at$25,000,'' said Duke.   The governor counters that state income tax figures for 1987showed that more than 70 percent of those filing returns made lessthan $25,000.   The Public Affairs Research Council, a government watchdoggroup, said the first-year increase in state taxes would total $116million. Personal taxes would increase in 1989-90 by $171 millionand business taxes would decline by $55 million.   By 1992-93, businesses would enjoy a $219 million decrease fromcurrent tax levels, PARC said. Personal taxes would rise to $218million by 1992-93, leaving total state tax revenues at virtuallythe same level as under the current structure, PARC said.</TEXT></DOC>
