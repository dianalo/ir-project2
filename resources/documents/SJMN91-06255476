Comy teaches self-abortion at the Women'sChoice Clinic in Oakland. Comy is a member of a self-help group that doesmenstrual extraction, a procedure that can induce abortion, but the group isnot associated with the Women's Choice Clinic, where Comy is a director.  </MEMO><TEXT>     She has the answer to her own question: home abortion.;    The women aregathered to hear about a method they say is a lot better than the coat hangersused before abortion was legal. The method of choice is called menstrualextraction and all it takes is some inexpensive equipment: a Mason jar fromthe local grocery store, some plastic tubing from a fish aquarium and theinner cylinder from a spray bottle. Get a syringe with a one-way valve from ahospital -- to work as a suction pump -- and the kit is complete.;   Jerry-rigged, it resembles a makeshift version of the suction equipmentdoctors use in a clinic. &quot;I've had it myself,&quot; Comy says.;     Doctors,however, warn that abortion is not as safe in the hands of an untrained personas it is when done by a skilled doctor. Risks include infection, incompleteabortion or perforating the woman's uterus -- and breaking the law.;    &quot;Itwould be practicing medicine without a license to do it to someone else,&quot; saysJanie Cordray, information officer for the Medical Board of California. &quot;It'ssomething that could be potentially dangerous.&quot;;    Comy and other&quot;self-helpers&quot; acknowledge that it takes skill and dedication to do abortionssafely. They acknowledge the risks. But that doesn't stop them.;    In atwo-hour session that goes over the details of home abortion, Comy tells womenit takes at least six months of learning from experienced &quot;self-helpers&quot; to dothe job well. About 1,000 copies of a half-hour video called &quot;No Going Back,&quot;which shows women performing a menstrual extraction, have been sold throughthe Los Angeles-based Federation for Feminist Health Centers, but Comy saysthat's only part of the training.;    &quot;You can't buy a video and do ityourself,&quot; Comy, director of the Women's Choice clinic in Oakland, tells thegroup of women assembled. But with the guidance of friends, she says, somewomen become so expert they do it routinely every few months, pregnant or not,without complications.;     With group members gathered around, the womandesiring menstrual extraction can direct them to help. &quot;Some women like to dotheir own pumping,&quot; Comy says.;    Comy knows she is treading on shaky legalground encouraging women to do this. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration,she says, has already told her it is illegal to sell or distribute a model ofthe kit, called the Del-Em, developed almost 20 years ago by a woman in LosAngeles.;    But if women learn to make their own, she says, she doesn't seehow they would get caught. &quot;How can they stop us from getting Mason jars?&quot; sheasks. &quot;You go to the grocery store and get the Mason jar. You go to the localaquarium and get some tubing.&quot;;    As for sterilizing the equipment -- animportant part of preventing infection -- she says, &quot;Your sterilization athome is the largest pressure cooker you can buy.;    &quot;How can they confiscatethat from us?&quot;;    The two dozen women gathered appear to range in age fromearly 20s to late 30s. Most of them are too young to have needed abortionsbefore 1973, when the U.S. Supreme Court made abortion legal throughout thenation.;    But in recent years, as courts have tried to restrict some of theways abortion can be provided, some women are betting that the 1973 landmarkruling will be overturned. Comy and others in a feminist network are makingsure they don't get caught unprepared for that day.;    &quot;We don't want to seeany more coat hangers,&quot; Comy tells the group. &quot;That's an act of desperation.&quot;;   In some cities, such as San Francisco and Los Angeles, there is a core ofwomen who have practiced &quot;self-help&quot; for 15 years or more. Much of theirefforts focus on doing self-help gynecological exams, to prevent vaginalinfections and predict menstrual cycles. Menstrual extractions are the mostcomplicated and &quot;advanced&quot; procedures they may attempt.;    As their numbershave grown, they spin off into new groups forming a loose, underground networkthat extends beyond Los Angeles, Chicago and Boston to Germany, theNetherlands and Australia.;    &quot;I have not a clue how many groups there are inthe world. It's not written down,&quot; says Eileen Schnitzer, another veteran&quot;self-helper&quot; who works in a rural clinic in Chico that's part of the LosAngeles-based Federation of Feminist Health Centers.;    Schnitzer says shegets calls from all over the country from women wanting to learn aboutmenstrual extractions. She recently went to Hawaii at the request of womenthere to train a group in gynecological exams, the first step.;    &quot;If a groupis serious, we'll send them speculums. Maybe go and present the video,&quot; shesays, referring to the &quot;No Going Back&quot; videotape. &quot;If I went to every placethat called, I'd never be here.&quot;;    Others, however, think the movement issmall and not likely to appeal to most women.;    &quot;The truth is, there arevery few people who will actually try this,&quot; says Diana Workman, executivedirector of a Sunnyvale clinic called Family Planning Alternatives. &quot;In termsof the mainstream population, it shouldn't be blown out of proportion.&quot;;   Experienced doctors say there's good reason to think twice about homeabortions. &quot;The real early abortion terminations have a higher rate ofcomplications,&quot; says Dr. Alan Lasnover, a South Bay obstetrician-gynecologistwho has done abortions for more than 20 years. &quot;That's in essence getting backto the coat-hanger days.&quot;;    Schnitzer doesn't deny that home abortioncarries some risk. &quot;It's not foolproof,&quot; she says.;    &quot;The whole thing thatmakes it safe is that these women are very concerned about each other,&quot; shesays. &quot;It's true, lay people don't have specialized medical training. But theydo have dedication.&quot;;    Dr. Philip Darney, an obstetrician-gynecologist atthe University of California, San Francisco, says he is sympathetic to themovement but does not approve of menstrual extraction. &quot;I can certainlyunderstand women feeling that the way that the Supreme Court is going, theymay have no choice,&quot; Darney says. &quot;But that's not the best alternative.;    &quot;Ithink we should spend our energies to keep abortion legal.&quot;;    Both Comy andSchnitzer say they would prefer to keep abortion legal. &quot;We need legalabortion,&quot; Schnitzer says. &quot;It's going to be horrible if all we have ismenstrual extraction. There isn't exactly a kit on every street corner.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  DONNA ALVARADO, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  San Francisco  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910911  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  DRAWING; PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,250  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 11, 199100255476,SJ1  </DATELINE><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
