The request could reach the Holy See by the end of the week, the ministry said.    The Vatican bank's chairman, American-born Archbishop Paul C. Marcinkus; its managing director, Luigi Mennini, and its chief accountant, Pellegrino De Stroebel, are accused by Milan magistrates of being &quot;accessories to a fraudulent bankruptcy&quot; in the Ambrosiano collapse. All three men reside within Vatican City, an independent state with which Italy has no official extradition treaty.    Banco Ambrosiano's collapse, under some $1.3 billion in debts, was the biggest bank failure in Italian history. Though much of the money disappeared through Panamanian companies, which the Vatican bank, or Istituto per le Opere di Religione, &quot;directly or indirectly&quot; controlled, the IOR has always denied any responsibility for the bank's collapse. But in 1984, the IOR agreed to pay $250 million to Ambrosiano creditors as a &quot;goodwill&quot; gesture. As part of that accord, the creditors agreed to any drop civil suits against the Vatican bank. A Vatican spokesman declined to comment on the extradition issue. But Vatican sources said the Holy See will seek to refute the charges through all legal channels available. This could include a legal appeal against the arrest warrants themselves, the sources said. </TEXT></DOC>
