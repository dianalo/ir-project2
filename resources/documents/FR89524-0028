Introduction</ITAG>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announces its intent to deletethe Jibboom Junkyard site from the National Priorities List (NPL), AppendixB of the National Oil and Hazardous Substances Pollution Contingency Plan,40 CFR Part 300 (NCP). The EPA identifies sites that appear to presenta significant risk to public health, welfare or the environment and maintainsthe NPL as the list of those sites. Sites on the NPL may be the subjectof Hazardous Superfund Fund (Fund) financed remedial actions. Any sitedeleted from the NPL remains eligible for additional Fund-financed remedialactions in the unlikely event that conditions at the site warrant suchaction.The EPA will accept comments on this proposal for 30 days after its publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.Section II of this notice explains the criteria for deleting sites fromthe NPL. Section III discusses the procedures that EPA is using for thisaction. Section IV discusses the history of this site and explains howthis site meets the deletion criteria.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. NPL Deletion Criteria</ITAG>The 1985 amendments to the NCP established the criteria the Agency usesto delete sites from the NPL. 40 CFR 300.66(o)(7) provides that sites ``maybe deleted or recategorized on the NPL where no further response is appropriate.''In making this decision, EPA will consider whether any of the followingcriteria have been met:(i) EPA, in consultation with the State, has determined that responsibleor other parties have implemented all appropriate response actions required:(ii) All appropriate Fund-financed responses under CERCLA have been implementedand EPA, in consultation with the State, has determined that no furthercleanup by responsible parties is appropriate; or(iii) Based on a remedial investigation, EPA, in consultation with theState, has determined that the release poses no significant threat to publichealth or the environment and, therefore, taking of remedial measures isnot appropriate.Prior to deciding to delete a site from the NPL, EPA must determine thatthe remedy, or existing site conditions at sites where no action is required,is protective of public health, welfare and the environment.Deletion of a site from the NPL does not preclude eligibility for subsequentadditional Fund-financed actions if future site conditions warrant suchactions. Section 300.66(c)(8) of the NCP states that Fund-financed actionsmay be taken at sites that have been deleted from the NPL.Deletion of sites from the NPL does not itself create, alter, revoke anyindividual's rights or obligations. Furthermore, deletion from the NPLdoes not in any way alter EPA's right to take enforcement actions, as appropriate.The NPL is designed primarily for informational purposes and to assistin Agency management.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Deletion Procedures</ITAG>Upon determination that at least one of the criteria described in andSection;300.66(c)(7)has been met, EPA may formally begin deletion procedures. The first stepsare the preparation of a Superfund Close Out Report and the establishmentof the local information repository and the Regional deletion docket. Theseactions have been completed. This <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, and a concurrent notice in the localnewspaper in the vicinity of the site, announce the initiation of a 30day public comment period. The public is asked to comment on EPA's intentionto delist the site from the NPL: all critical documents needed to evaluateEPA's decision are generally included in the information repository anddeletion docket.Upon completion of the public comment period, the EPA Regional office willprepare a responsiveness summary to evaluate and address concerns whichwere raised. The public is welcome to contact the EPA Regional office toobtain a copy of this responsiveness summary, when available. If EPA stilldetermines that deletion from the NPL is appropriate, a final notice ofdeletion will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. However, it is not until the next official NPLrulemaking that the site would be actually delisted.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Basis for Intended Site Deletion</ITAG>The following summary provides the Agency's rationale for intending todelete this site from the NPL.Jibboom Junkyard Superfund Site, Sacramento, CaliforniaThe Jibboom Junkyard is a nine acre site located in downtown Sacramento,California. The site is situated along the Sacramento River, approximately2,000 feet downstream from the confluence of the Sacramento and AmericanRivers, and approximately 400 feet southeast, and downstream, of the waterintake which supplies water for up to 145,000 people in Sacramento.Between 1950 or 1951 and 1965, the site was operated as a metals salvagebusiness by the Associated Metals Company. All grade of metals were salvaged,including railroad cars, army tanks, batteries, and possibly some transformers.The property was purchased in 1965 by the State of California for easementand construction of Interstate 5 (I-5). Construction began soon thereafterand when completed, 6.7 acres of the site had been covered up by eitherI-5 or the realigned Jibboom Street.Between 1981 and 1985, EPA and the State of California Department of HealthServices (DHS) performed extensive on- and off-site surface and subsurfacesoil sampling. Very elevated concentrations of copper, lead, and zinc (upto 6,310 parts per million (ppm), 13,600 ppm, and 19,700 ppm, respectively)were detected at the surface and at four subsurface locations. On February14, 1985, the draft Feasibility Study was released for a three week publiccomment period. On May 9, 1985, in accordance with the Initial Remedy DelegationReport, Region 9 approved a Record of Decision (ROD) which selected excavationand off-site disposal of all soil contaminated with lead above 200 ppm,the background level.An amendment to the ROD, which changed the cleanup level to 500 ppm lead,was signed on October 4, 1985. The new level was determined to providecomplete protection of human health and the environment and is in accordancewith the Acting Assistant Administrator of the Office of Solid Waste andEmergency Response June 17, 1985 interpretation of the Landfill and SurfaceImpoundment Requirements of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976,as amended (RCRA), 40 CFR 264.111.On May 10, 1985, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) began designof the selected alternative. The design was completed in September, 1985.On July 14, 1986, USACE awarded a contract for the remedial action to U.S.Pollution Control, Inc., for $1.985 million. Extensive revisions to thecontractor's remedial action work plan caused site mobilization activitiesto be delayed until late October, 1986.Remedial action construction activities continued until May 27, 1987, whena Joint Pre-Final Inspection was conducted by EPA, USACE, and DHS. Theinspection determined that the remedial action was complete as specifiedin the ROD and remedial design, except for the 60 day vegetation establishmentperiod required by the remedial design. The Final Inspection, which washeld on July 26, 1987, determined that the revegetation was acceptable.The remedial action was thereby determined to be complete: 12,067 tonsof contaminated soils had been removed to the RCRA- and CERCLA-approvedhazardous waste landfill in Clive, Utah and construction costs totaled$3,991,315, with 21 change orders and no claims.Extensive subsurface soil sampling by the USACE during the remedial actionconfirmed that all lead had been removed to below 500 ppm. In addition,all other contaminants detected were removed to deminimus or non-detectablelevels. A summary of the soil sampling is contained in the USACE FinalTechnical Report, dated March 30, 1988, and the Site Specific Quality ManagementPlan, dated November 2, 1987 (both documents are available in the deletiondocket).EPA sampled and analyzed ground water twice, one sampling episode occurredon December 22, 1986 and the other occurred during the week of August 10,1987. The results confirmed that ground water was not contaminated by theJibboom Junkyard and that there was no ground water contamination at thecompletion of the remedial action.For a period of one year, until July 26, 1988, EPA performed operationand maintenance activities at the site. Since that date, the State of Californiahas assumed responsibility for the site.EPA, in consultation with the State of California, has determined thatall appropriate Fund-financed response under CERCLA has been implementedat the Jibboom Junkyard and that no further cleanup by responsible partiesis appropriate. The State of California has given its concurrence on thedeletion of this site from the NPL.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: December 20, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Daniel W.
