Some shouted they would rather die than return to Vietnam, localradio and television stations reported.   About 3,000 Vietnamese marched around the camp at the outlyingHei Ling Chau island, a former leper colony, and another 3,000demonstrated at Whitehead camp in the New Territories. About 300staged a protest at the Chi Ma Wan center on the offshore Lantauisland.   The demonstrations were peaceful and none lasted more than twohours, government spokesman Lionel Rodrigues said.   Hong Kong's chief secretary, Sir David Ford, defended theinvoluntary repatriation of Vietnamese, saying the program willcontinue despite international criticism.   ``It is our intention to put into place a continuing program toreturn to Vietnam all those who are judged not to be refugees,''Chief Secretary Sir David Ford told the Legislative Council. Hisspeech did not include a timetable for further repatriation.   In London, Foreign Office Minister Francis Maude said it couldtake as long as two years to return all the Vietnamese, classifiedas illegal immigrants. He said Britain could not delay just becauseit makes other countries uncomfortable.   ``It's all very well for others to say to us, `Can't you delay alittle bit longer?' but that plea has been made to us before,''Maude told a parliamentary committee.   Vietnam, in a commentary monitored in Bangkok, partly blamedeconomic embargos imposed by non-Communist nations for causing itscitizens to flee.   ``The policy of hostility and economic sanctions ... by somecountries against Vietnam over the past 10 years are one of thereasons causing economic difficulties in Vietnam,'' it said. ``Thisled to the fact that some people fled the country.''   About 44,000 Vietnamese who have sailed into Hong Kong sinceJune 1988 are considered illegal immigrants unless they can provethey fled their Communist homeland out of fear of persecution.   Nearly 6,800 have been denied refugee status after beingscreened by immigration officials, compared with slightly more than700 who qualified.   The first batch to be sent home against their will were whiskedscreaming and crying from their detention center by riot policebefore dawn Tuesday and put on a plane to Hanoi. Vietnam haspromised the returnees will be treated humanely and not punished,the Hong Kong government says.   It argues that returning the Vietnamese home is more humane thankeeping them indefinitely in the camps, which are overcrowded andrife with violence and malnutrition.   But human rights organizations, British opposition politiciansand the U.S. government have criticized the program. The U.S. StateDepartment expressed deep regret over the repatriations and said,``British authorities should continue to grant asylum to all thosepersons from Vietnam who seek it.''   Ford responded that ``those who have been loudest in theircondemnation have been slowest in bringing forward practicalalternatives. We have returned no one who in the eyes of theinternational community is a bona fide refugee.''   He added: ``We do not look for the world's applause, but we areentitled, I feel, to the world's understanding.''   About 56,000 Vietnamese are housed in squalid camps. Those whoarrived before June 1988 automatically were granted refugee statusand are eligible for resettlement.   China, which will assume control of the British colony in 1997,has said it would like Hong Kong to resolve the Vietnamese refugeeissue before then.</TEXT></DOC>
