The historic bill, adopted by the House and Senate near midnight Friday, includes a patchwork finance scheme combining elements of the Bush administration's &quot;off-budget&quot; plan with a Democratic-backed proposal to rely on Treasury borrowings.    Under the compromise, the U.S. will have to lay out $20 billion of the rescue funds before Sept. 30 -- twice the level that would have been spent by that time under President Bush's original proposal. According to administration officials, that means the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. could begin pumping cash into insolvent Sandamp;Ls this week, thus reducing their need to offer above-market rates to attract deposits.    &quot;This will let us move more quickly,&quot; said Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber.    The speed with which regulators intend to act contrasts sharply with the years of regulatory and legislative neglect that led to adoption of history's biggest financial bailout. The bill ultimately will commit $50 billion in borrowings, plus more than $100 billion of interest over the next 10 years, to close or merge insolvent Sandamp;Ls.    The legislation will prompt huge changes in the financial-services industry, blurring further the differences between banks and thrifts. Thrifts will be forced to employ the more-realistic accounting practices of the banking industry and will be subject to banks' tougher capital standards. Thrifts will be restricted to investing in more-conservative bank-like instruments, thus excluding such things as junk bonds and direct equity holdings, unless they invest through separately capitalized subsidiaries.    Banks, for their part, will be permitted to buy healthy Sandamp;Ls for the first time. And Federal Home Loan Banks, an important source of funds for most thrifts, will be permitted to lend to banks that invest in home mortgages.    Passage of the bill was perhaps the biggest victory yet for the Bush administration in Congress. But negative repercussions may persist from a White House confrontation with Congress during the tense days before passage. President Bush explicitly threatened to veto the package, causing Democrats who initially backed the proposal to abandon it at the last minute.    That is likely to take a toll on the president's relations with Congress, several important Democrats said. &quot;There is a very bad taste in the mouth of the Democrats,&quot; said Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.).    With more than 500 Sandamp;Ls insolvent, the Treasury's Mr. Glauber said yesterday that the government won't have any difficulty spending $20 billion before the current federal fiscal year ends Sept. 30. &quot;We can spend that easily,&quot; he said.    The largest chunk, $15 billion, will go to replacing the highest-cost deposits or other forms of borrowing at some of the 250 thrifts that are already under the management of the FDIC. Many of these institutions, in order to preserve liquidity, are paying steep premiums over market rates in order to attract depositors. By easing the pressure on unhealthy Sandamp;Ls to boost rates, the legislation is expected to help reduce interest rates for thrifts in general.    Even though it is parking the $15 billion in the sick thrifts now, the FDIC will be able to use the money to dispose of institutions after the fiscal year ends. The funds injected into the thrifts now will reduce the operating losses that regulators ultimately will have to subsidize when the sick thrifts are closed or sold. And presumably, the FDIC can use cash from one institution to complete transactions involving other institutions.    The remaining $5 billion of the $20 billion to be spent within the next two months would go toward merging or liquidating the worst of the sick thrifts, using the funds to pay off depositors or compensate buyers of sick thrifts for existing losses.    Of course, before the government can spend $20 billion, it must raise that sum. Mr. Glauber said the money will be drawn initially from Treasury cash balances and from the sale of cash-management bills, or short-term IOUs. The debt will be refinanced across the spectrum of Treasury securities in October, November and December, he said. The Treasury won't sell any other long-term securities in August or September beyond those already scheduled.    In addition to reformulating the accounting and regulatory rules that govern thrifts, the law will put thrift-industry regulators under the supervision of the Treasury and the FDIC. It also will create a new arm of the FDIC, called the Resolution Trust Corp., which will inevitably put pressure on real estate markets across the country as it disposes of up to $400 billion in office buildings, shopping centers, raw land, apartment buildings and other investments formerly held by sick Sandamp;Ls.    In a provision that most Republicans fought, the Federal Home Loan Banks must set aside a portion of annual earnings to subsidize low-income mortgages. The total from the home loan banks would start at $75 million in 1990, and increase to $150 million after 1995. In a similar provision, the Resolution Trust Corp. would also be required to give state and local non-profit housing agencies a 90-day right of first refusal to purchase certain low-cost residential properties.    Despite a fight over the matter, the bill maintains a new practice in which the FDIC protects so-called bank investment contracts, or huge pension fund deposits, with deposit insurance. While federal deposit insurance explictly guarantees deposits up to $100,000, the huge funds will be protected up to $100,000 per individual investor in a given beneficiary program. Several legislators argued that allowing that rule to stand magnifies the risk to the deposit insurance fund. In the bill, the issue was relegated to a study.    Legislators also consigned, to two studies, to assess risk presented by other &quot;off budget&quot; government liabilities. In the fight over financing the bailout, Democrats argued that government-sponsored enterprises are proliferating for such items as student college loans, farm credit and housing subsidies. Using those vehicles to deal with such problems as the thrift bailout helps hide the extent of the government's liability. Some lawmakers expressed concern that other big problems such as drug abuse or homelessness could be dealt with similarly.    &quot;This will be a precedent cited by many in Congress in the future,&quot; warned House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.)    In a strange political deal, the bill preserves the status of the nation's top thrift regulator, embattled Danny Wall, without new Senate confirmation. Thanks to his close ties to Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah), Mr. Wall's job was protected in the House-Senate conference committee as part of a trade-off involving the House's financing package, which itself was ultimately altered in a compromise.    The trade-off that preserved Mr. Wall's position was arranged with the help of Sen. Alan Cranston (D., Calif.), who has been embarrassed by recent reports of his efforts to help the executive of an insolvent thrift who fought Mr. Wall's efforts to take control of the thrift. Should Mr. Wall have been forced to endure confirmation proceedings, Sen. Cranston's actions could have become the subject of new scrutiny. The bill also budgets $75 million for the Justice Department to prosecute thrift and bank crimes, and requires the creation of a new deposit-insurance window insignia to be displayed by thrifts. The logo is to include the words, &quot;Backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government.&quot;    By the end of last week, it was unclear whether the bill would pass at all. In a last-minute confrontation to try to keep the financing off of the federal budget, Mr. Bush sternly threatened a veto, which would have placed the entire $50 billion in borrowings squarely on the budget -- swelling the budget deficit by that amount. In the resulting game of brinkmanship with congressional Democrats, the bill ultimately emerged with a Republican stamp.    Earlier last week, in the House-Senate conference working out differences between the chambers, negotiators agreed to adopt the House financing plan, which would have saved roughly $5 billion over 30 years in the bill. The House measure would have been cheaper because direct borrowings by the Treasury would have been less expensive than the borrowings by the off-budget agency envisioned by the president.    But on Thursday, mindful of the president's veto threat, the Senate shot down the conference plan. The bill failed to receive the &quot;supermajority&quot; of 60 votes necessary in this case because it would have required a waiver of the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction targets.    With a monthlong recess scheduled to begin the next day, late-night negotiations commenced among Budget Director Richard Darman, Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and representatives of the House and Senate. House Banking Committee Chairman Henry Gonzalez (D., Texas), desperate to find a solution, squeaked through the compromise plan on a 26-22 vote, with $20 billion on budget and the remainder off budget. Rep. Gonzalez got the measure through only by voting the proxies of at least five absent members.    Furious Democrats warned the administration that it might have pushed so hard for its financing plan that support for the overall bill could dissolve. &quot;This legislation is not terribly appetizing to members generally,&quot; Sen. Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) warned Messrs. Brady and Darman. &quot;We may not muster enough votes on the final passage.&quot;    By Friday, enough support was lined up in the Senate to pass the bill on a voice vote, but not until Sen. Charles Grassley (R., Iowa) demanded a standing count of senators. Of those remaining in the chamber late Friday, 17 senators stood in favor of it, and seven against it. The rest had begun their recess.    In the House, the vote was more dramatic. Earlier in the day, four influential Democratic committee chairmen sent letters to their colleagues urging them to oppose the bill, while the administration pushed hard for support from Republicans who were lukewarm to the bill. Republicans who had previously opposed the bill were suddenly lining up behind it. &quot;Yesterday I stood in this well and argued against this measure,&quot; said Rep. David Dreier (R., Calif.). &quot;Today I am just as strongly in favor of it.&quot; It passed 201-175, with overwhelming Republican approval.    ---   David Wessel contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
