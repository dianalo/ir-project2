Just two years ago, a couple had to file if income was $5,830 ormore, as did a single person whose income was at least $3,560. Now,a single person under 65 need not file until income hits $4,950.   Whether you have to file depends on your income and your filingstatus. You must file if your income is more than the total of thepersonal exemptions for yourself and any spouse plus your basicstandard deduction.   In most cases, the filing thresholds are higher if one or bothspouses is over the age of 65. But they do not increaseautomatically because of blindness, as the standard deduction does.   Most married couples will find it advantageous to file a jointreturn, even though both spouses earn income. But there areexceptions, and the only way to be certain you are making the rightchoice is to figure your taxes twice _ once on a joint return andonce on separate returns.   Here are guidelines for the various filing statuses:   MARRIED FILING JOINTLY: You must have been married on Dec. 31,1988; although there is no requirement that you and your spouse beliving together, you may not be legally separated. Each spouse isliable for the full amount of tax, even though one earned no income.The filing thresholds: $8,900 if both spouses are under 65; $9,500if one is 65 or older, and $10,100 if both are 65 or older.   MARRIED FILING SEPARATELY: The definition of ``married'' is thesame as with a joint return. But if you file separately, the filingthreshold is $1,950 regardless of age. You report only your incomeand none of your spouse's, and claim only your deductions. If onespouse itemizes deductions, so must the other.   Some people may save money by filing separately. For example, ifone spouse has a large amount of medical or unreimbursed employeeexpenses, more of those deductions could be claimed by filingseparately.   That is because only medical expenses exceeding 7.5 percent ofadjusted gross income and only miscellaneous expenses exceeding 2percent of AGI may be deducted. If, for example, you have $5,000 ofunreimbursed medical expenses, it would be easier to exceed 7{percent of your income than to exceed 7{ percent of the combinedincome of both spouses.   HEAD OF HOUSEHOLD: If you qualify for these tax rates, which areabout midway between those for singles and couples filing jointly,you will have to file a return if income is $6,350 or more, assumingyou are under 65, or at least $7,100 if 65 or older.   In general, you qualify if:   _ You were unmarried at yearend (or your spouse did not live inyour home during the last six months of the year), and:   _ You paid over half the cost of maintaining your home as theprincipal residence of your unmarried child or grandchild, or of amarried child or grandchild whom you can claim as a dependent, or ofany other relative whom you can claim.   SURVIVING SPOUSE: If your spouse died last year and you did notremarry, filing thresholds are the same as for a married couplefiling jointly. You may claim a $1,950 personal exemption for yourspouse and file a joint return for 1988. As a rule, you may usejoint tax rates _ but not claim an exemption for the spouse _ fortwo additional years following the year of death of a spouse if youfurnish over half the cost of keeping a home for your dependentchild.   SINGLE: You must file if income is $4,950 or more, if under 65;or $5,700, if 65 or older. You are considered single if you werelegally separated or unmarried on Dec. 31, 1988.   The rules are different if you can be claimed as a dependent bysomeone else. If all your income was earned _ wages, tips,scholarships _ your filing threshold is $3,000. If you had anyearned income, such as interest and dividends, and you are under 65,your threshold is $500. The figure rises to $1,100 if you aremarried and 65 or older, and to $1,250 if you are single and 65 orolder.</TEXT></DOC>
