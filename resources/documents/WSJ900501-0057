For the past 60 years, the sales of Treasury bills, notesand bonds have been conducted mostly by hand by the FederalReserve Bank of New York, on behalf of the U.S. Treasury.</LP><TEXT>   This quaint procedure is increasingly irritating many ofthe Fed's 44 primary dealers, the elite group of securitiesfirms that must bid at every Treasury debt sale in exchangefor the privilege of trading directly with Fed.   These dealers say the sales could easily be computerized,providing results in minutes, instead of hours. The speediersales not only would help dealers avoid costly mistakes, theysay, but also would save the Treasury millions of dollarsannually in borrowing costs and lessen auction-day turmoil inthe world's largest bond market.   &quot;It's an antiquated system and it ought to change in thisday and age,&quot; says E. Craig Coats Jr., a managing director atFirst Boston Corp.   The Fed, as the Treasury's fiscal agent, conducts thesales of Treasury securities, which totaled $1.25 trillionlast year, to fund the federal deficit. Tomorrow, the size ofthe quarterly note and bond auction next week will beannounced, and it is expected to total about $30 billion.   Dealers say they have periodically pleaded with Treasuryand Fed officials to automate auction procedures, which havechanged little since three-month Treasury bill sales startedin 1929. Their requests prompted officials two years ago toquicken existing procedures by encouraging the clerksinvolved in sorting and counting the bids to work faster.That effort shaved about 40 minutes off the wait for auctionresults.   But even so, winners aren't notified of purchases until aslong as three hours after the 1 p.m. EDT bidding deadline.The reason is that after the deadline has passed, the steelboxes containing the bids are brought to the eighth floor ofthe New York Fed for processing by hand. The preliminarytally is then faxed to the Treasury for final compilation.   Traders envision computerized auctions that would enablethem to type in their bids on a keyboard and send themdirectly to the New York Fed, just as the World Bank'strading desk in Washington already does.   Bidders are concerned about market risk because auctiondays -- especially those that involve infrequently offeredsecurities -- are among the most volatile days for the U.S.bond market. The anxious wait for results breeds rumors thatcan whipsaw prices of more than $100 billion of securitiesthat trade daily.   For example, consider the Treasury's attempts earlier thisyear to sell 40-year bonds for the first time since the1950s. The auctions of $5 billion of these securities inJanuary and $3.5 billion in April by the Resolution FundingCorp., the agency created to fund the federal government'srescue of the thrift industry, drew considerable interestbecause of their novelty.   Around the bidding deadline at both auctions, rumorssurfaced about robust demand for the new &quot;bailout&quot; bonds,which lifted the entire bond market. But results issued threehours later showed that those rumors were false, and bondprices fell a full point late in the afternoon on the day ofthe first sale and half a point following the second auction.&quot;By having timely results, you would have avoided thosemarket slides,&quot; contends Joseph Liro, a money marketeconomist at S.G. Warburg Securities Co.   The latest attempt to lobby for electronic auctions beganin February when a trade group representing primary dealersmet with New York Fed officials and offered to shoulder someof the costs of automation. The discussions initiated by thePublic Securities Association were widened early last monthto include senior staff at the Treasury. The result is thatthe Treasury and the New York Fed have agreed to study thepossibility of computerizing the auctions.   The dealers are eager to move fast. &quot;I would hope by thefall we would have a working, automated auction system inplace,&quot; says Thomas Pura, chairman of the PSA's primarydealer committee and a partner at Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.   But Michael Basham, deputy assistant secretary of federalfinance at the Treasury, cautions, &quot;It's at least a year awayfrom implementation.&quot; The typically tight-lipped New York Fedallows through a spokesman that &quot;we are at a highlypreliminary point.&quot;   Well, says Mr. Pura, the effort &quot;is tentative, but theimportant thing is that we have the dealers, the Fed and theTreasury working together. The biggest hurdle has beenovercome.&quot;   While all of the Fed's 12 regional banks and 25 branchesaccept bids for the auctions, the New York Fed typicallycollects 80% to 90% of the competitive offers because it isclose to the nation's largest brokerage firms and commercialbanks.   Until auctions enter the computer age, the Treasury willpay a hefty premium to finance its borrowing, many automationproponents assert. That is because bidders usually add alittle extra to the interest rates they offer to pay on thesecurities to compensate for the risk involved in waiting forresults, they say. &quot;It's almost like a bit of an insurancepremium,&quot; says Mr. Liro of S.G. Warburg.   In a volatile market, where prices can move a full pointin minutes, or $10 for every $1,000 face amount of a 30-yearTreasury bond, there is a chance that prices of thesecurities offered at the auction will have edged lower bythe time results are announced. That trims the returns todealers, who resell most of these securities to customers orin the secondary market. Of course, the opposite sometimesoccurs and prices move higher during the wait, earning thefirms a better-than-expected profit.   But whether bidders win or lose, it is the Treasury thatpays for their risk, those who favor automation say. Theauctions are &quot;a costly process for the Treasury and adifficult one for dealers,&quot; says James R. Capra, a seniorvice president at Shearson Lehman Government Securities Inc.   Mr. Capra says the premium built into auction bids isabout what a broker would charge a client for a veryshort-term option to sell bonds at a fixed price. In thiscase, the broker's &quot;customer&quot; would be the Treasury and the&quot;option&quot; would give the federal government the right to sellsecurities late in the afternoon of auction day at the marketprice of three hours earlier.   On the day that the Treasury last sold 30-year bonds, Feb.8, the cost of a three-hour option to sell a 30-year bond was1/4 point, or $2.50 for a $1,000 face amount, according todata of GFI Group Inc., a broker of over-the-counter Treasurybond options. That option cost twice as much as on a typicalday because the bond sale made the market jittery. Using Mr.Capra's estimate of bidders' &quot;cushion,&quot; the hidden cost tothe Treasury for the $10 billion of 30-year securities soldin February was $25 million.   With automation, &quot;hundreds of millions of dollars could besaved over the years by the U.S. government,&quot; says Mr. Puraof the securities group.   The Treasury's Mr. Basham concurs: &quot;Even if it saved afraction on the $1.25 trillion of securities that areauctioned each year, that's a substantial savings.&quot;   Not everybody agrees with these projections. Some dealerssay the auctions are so competitive that there is little, ifany, risk premium. &quot;The savings would be minuscule,&quot; saysScott E. Pardee, co-chairman of the U.S. unit of YamaichiSecurities Co. and a former senior official at the New YorkFed.</TEXT></DOC>
