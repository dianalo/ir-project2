The case could provide the U.S. Supreme Court with anopportunity to overturn its 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, whichrecognized women's constitutional right to abortion.</LP><TEXT>   The opinion, by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the ThirdCircuit in Philadelphia, said that abortion for women underage 18 can proceed only after parental consent and that allwomen seeking an abortion must first listen to astate-prepared talk from a doctor about the risks andbenefits of abortion and childbirth, then wait 24 hours. Theappeals court struck down an aspect of the Pennsylvania lawrequiring that married women notify their husbands beforeobtaining an abortion.   &quot;I think it's fair to say that the Third Circuit hasdecided that Roe vs. Wade is no longer the law of the land.They've adopted a new test,&quot; said Thomas E. Zemaitis, alawyer at the Philadelphia law firm of Pepper, Hamilton andamp;Scheetz who represented one of the plaintiffs who challengedthe Pennsylvania law.   The Pennsylvania law was the first abortion law passedafter the U.S. Supreme Court's July 1989 ruling in Webstervs. Reproductive Health Services, in which a sharply dividedcourt upheld several Missouri law restrictions, including aban on abortions in public hospitals and clinics. The Websterdecision was widely seen as an invitation for states to stepup their involvement in the abortion issue and increase theirregulation.   Several cases involving more stringent abortionrestrictions enacted elsewhere, including Guam, Louisiana andUtah, are working their way through lower federal courts. TheLouisiana case challenges a law that amounts to an outrightabortion ban in most instances and would provide an obviousvehicle for addressing the validity of Roe vs. Wade,according to lawyers. But Pennsylvania's law, declaredunconstitutional by a federal judge in Philadelphia in August1990, is the only one in which a federal appeals court hasruled.   Anti-abortion groups hailed the appeal's court decision asan important victory and predicted that it will be upheld ifappealed to the Supreme Court. &quot;We believe this particulardecision should be upheld under Roe because it involvesinformed consent, which is not directly prohibiting abortionin any way,&quot; said Dr. Wanda Franz, president of the NationalRight to Life Committee, an anti-abortion group inWashington.   An appeal of yesterday's decision could provide theopportunity for the Supreme Court to overturn Roe vs. Wade,which many Supreme Court analysts say a majority of thejustices now is willing to do. It remained unclear yesterdaywhether plaintiffs would appeal to the Supreme Court.   Two big question marks are Justice David Souter and JudgeClarence Thomas, who will join the high court Nov. 1,succeeding Justice Thurgood Marshall. Justice Souter hasn'thad an opportunity to express his views directly on Roe vs.Wade. Judge Thomas said during his confirmation hearings thathe not only didn't have an opinion on Roe vs. Wade but thathe couldn't even recall having discussed it.   Abortion-rights advocates, nevertheless, are pessimisticabout both Justice Souter and Judge Thomas. Justice Soutervoted with the majority in a decision in May that upheldfederal regulations barring health clinics that receivefederal aid from discussing abortion with patients. JudgeThomas, before he joined the federal appeals court inWashington, praised an article that argued that abortionshould be prohibited as unconstitutional. He also signed aWhite House report saying that Roe vs. Wade had been wronglydecided.   The high court has been chipping away at Roe vs. Wade fora number of years, prompting abortion-rights advocates tocontend that the ruling has already, in effect, beenreversed.   If yesterday's decision is appealed to the Supreme Court,the justices could theoretically accelerate the reviewprocess to allow for a decision by next July. But lawyersconsider that unlikely. Instead, the high court wouldprobably schedule oral arguments in the case for sometime inthe fall of 1992 and issue a decision by early 1993. SomeRepublicans fear that a decision overturning Roe vs. Wadebefore the November 1992 elections could create a backlashagainst GOP candidates among women voters.   The Supreme Court isn't obligated to hear the case at all,although many lawyers who follow the abortion issue have saidthat a majority led by Chief Justice William Rehnquist islooking for an opportunity to rule on it.   &quot;This decision is shocking because the Third Circuit Courtof Appeals has gone far beyond its authority and abandonedthe fundamental principles of Roe vs. Wade,&quot; Kate Michelman,director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said.&quot;The stage is now set for the restructured Supreme Court tooverturn Roe vs. Wade and deny the right to choose toAmerican women.&quot;   Even if the high court hears the case and upholds thedecision of the federal appeals court, the justices wouldn'tnecessarily have to reverse Roe vs. Wade in its entirety.Instead, the court could nominally preserve Roe vs. Wade andrule that the Pennsylvania law doesn't violate the precedentset by that case.   Before the Supreme Court's decision in the Webster case, astate had the burden of proving that its abortion law serveda compelling need and was drafted in the narrowest possibleterms.   But under the new test articulated by the Websterdecision, the responsibility has shifted to the partychallenging a law to show that it poses an undue burden on awoman's constitutional right to privacy.   In its 103-page opinion, the court's three-member panelruled that a state-prepared talk on abortion and childbirthwould pose no undue burden because it involves minimal timeand expense and because &quot;there is no evidence that anyabortion provider will stop providing abortions because ofthe requirement.&quot;   Similarly, the 24-hour waiting period required before theabortion can be performed is, the judges wrote, &quot;a small costto impose to ensure that a woman's decision is wellconsidered in light of its certain and irreparableconsequences.&quot;   The judges also found that the parental-consentrequirement for women under 18 poses no undue burden, becausea provision allows judges to override that aspect of the lawif a woman doesn't want to or cannot obtain her parents'consent. In such a case, a judge would have to make a formalfinding that the woman was mature enough to make an informeddecision.   Without that provision, the judges wrote, the consentrequirement would have been found unconstitutional. Only theprovision requiring married women to inform their husbandsbefore getting an abortion was found to pose an undue burdenon the right to privacy because of the likelihood that womencould be coerced into changing their minds.</TEXT></DOC>
