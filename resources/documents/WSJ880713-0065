The measure, passed on a 91-6 vote, includes a one-year suspension of the federal law that allows the Transportation Department to deny a state as much as 10% of its federal highway funds if more than half the motorists monitored there exceed the 55 mile-per-hour speed limit.    The provision, added to the bill by New York Sens. Daniel Moynihan, a Democrat, and Alfonse D'Amato, a Republican, and adopted by a voice vote, reflects tensions between lawmakers from densely populated states and those from more-rural states.    Congress voted last year to allow states to raise the speed limit along rural stretches of interstate highways to 65 mph. If a state raised the speed limit on rural stretches, all interstate highways within that state would be exempt from the compliance requirement. The one-year suspension would give lawmakers time to make the law more consistent, according to Mr. Moynihan.    Currently, three states -- New York, California and North Dakota -- are in danger of losing federal highway funds because motorists there drive too fast.    The provision isn't part of the House-passed version of the transportation-spending bill.    The Senate bill includes a prohibition on the use of federal funds to build highway interchanges needed to link thoroughfares with a controversial proposed development on private land next to the Manassas National Battlefield Park in Virginia.    The House version would also ban the planning and design work for the interchanges, work that the Senate bill would allow to go forward. Differences in the two measures will be reconciled by a House-Senate conference.    Reflecting heightened concern over air safety, the Senate legislation includes $6.5 billion for the Federal Aviation Administration, a 13% increase over current spending but $122,000 less than in the House bill. Increased funding is earmarked for the air-traffic control system and airport expansion.    The Senate-passed bill doesn't contain provisions, included in the House version, to give certain protections for airline employees who are laid off or otherwise harmed financially by airline mergers.    As in previous years, the bill ignores President Reagan's requests to kill federal subsidies to mass-transit systems and to Amtrak, the national passenger rail service.    Overall, the Senate measure is $240 million less than the House bill and $1.8 billion more than the Reagan administration had requested. </TEXT></DOC>
