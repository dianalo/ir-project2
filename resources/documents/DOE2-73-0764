Working conditions were monitoredat four facilities producing standard insulation products and in sixfacilities producing or using small diameter glass fibers (less than1.0 micrometer). Airborne fiber concentrations in the four facilitiesproducing conventional insulation products were extremely low with thehighest average concentration being 0.1 fibers per milliliter (ml). Thehighest single concentration was 0.83 fibers/ml. The highest mean totaldust concentration at these facilities was 2.73mg/cu m with the highestsingle measurement being 14.5mg/cu m. The mean airborne concentrationsin the other six facilities ranged from 1.0 to 21.9 fibers/ml with thehighest single concentration being 44.1 fibers/ml. About 25 to 30% ofthese fibers were less than 5.0 micrometers in length. In the one fibrous-glassplastics operation which was surveyed, no fibers less than 5.0 micrometersin length were observed. The author suggests that it is prudent thatexposures to respirable glass fibers be kept at an absolute minimum throughthe use of appropriate engineering controls and materials-handling methods.</TEXT></DOC>
