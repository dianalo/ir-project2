Donohue said the investment is contingent on the receipt of an unspecified amount of financial assistance from the Quebec and Canadian governments. Construction is expected to begin in May for completion in early 1989.    The facility would produce an estimated 50,000 metric tons annually of pulp from waste newspapers and magazines. The pulp will be used to produce newsprint. A metric ton is equal to about 2,204.62 pounds.    Separately, Donohue said its new newsprint machine at Clermont was completed at a cost of 139 million dollars, or 31 million dollars less than initially budgeted. The machine, with annual capacity of 180,000 metric tons, is jointly owned by Donohue and New York Times Co., New York. </TEXT></DOC>
