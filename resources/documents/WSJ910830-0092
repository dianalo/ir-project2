To beef up its internal controls, the Salomon Inc. unithired the accounting firm Coopers andamp; Lybrand to launch acompliance review of the investment bank's U.S. securitiesoperations. The accounting firm will suggest ways in whichSalomon could better police itself.</LP><TEXT>   Salomon also said it plans to form a compliance committeeto prevent any repetition of the damaging regulatory missteptaken by its top management. Four top Salomon officialsresigned their posts this month -- John Gutfreund aschairman, Thomas Strauss as president, John Meriwether asvice chairman and Donald Feuerstein as chief counsel -- afterthe firm acknowledged that the executives had been told of atleast one unauthorized Salomon bid at a Treasury note auctionbut failed to report it to the government for several months.   The disclosures in the past few weeks that Salomonrepeatedly overstepped bidding limits at Treasury noteauctions and made unauthorized bids in some customers' nameshave rocked the firm, knocked its stock price down byone-third, frightened off some clients and led to acredit-rating downgrade, all as several government agenciesinvestigate the firm and the $2.3 trillion governmentsecurities market.   Salomon said in a statement that the compliance moves&quot;should go a long way toward advancing the firm's efforts torestore the trust and confidence of our clients, shareholdersand of government regulators.&quot;   Salomon also attempted to raise morale by callingattention to an announcement that New York state will addSalomon to the list of dealers who provide day-to-dayinvestment services to the state and its Urban DevelopmentCorp.   The New York announcement reflects the fact that the stateis suffering badly from Wall Street's four-year recession,having lost 31,900 jobs, about a 20% cut, in the securitiesindustry since 1987. At least four securities firms havethreatened to leave New York City: Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co.,Morgan Stanley Group Inc., Primerica Corp.'s Smith Barney,Harris Upham andamp; Co. and Prudential Insurance Co. of America'sPrudential Securities Inc. unit.   Any further blows to Salomon clearly would hurt the state.The 81-year-old firm's ties to New York run deep, and many ofSalomon's executives over the years -- including Messrs.Gutfreund and Strauss -- have been native New Yorkers. Astate government spokesman, referring to Salomon and its3,000 employees who still work in New York, said, &quot;We wanttheir workers on the payroll -- not the unemployment rolls.&quot;   Still, the state's announcement is somewhat ironic:Salomon said earlier in the year that it planned to pull its700-member back-office operation out of New York and move itto Tampa, Fla.   As part of Salomon's tighter internal controls, the firmsaid Robert Denham, recently appointed general counsel, andRichard Scribner, chief compliance officer, will &quot;cooperateactively with Coopers andamp; Lybrand, with the objective ofreviewing and improving the firm's compliance program.&quot;   Its new compliance committee will be headed by SalomonInc. director Lord Young of Graffham, the chairman of theexecutive committee of Salomon Brothers International Ltd.&quot;Compliance officers throughout the firm will have the rightto report directly to the compliance committee, and will havethe obligation to do so in circumstances where they are notfully satisfied with existing or any future practices,&quot; thefirm said.   Despite the compliance steps, analysts and Wall Streetexecutives expect further fallout from Salomon'scredit-rating downgrade. Moody's Investors Service Inc.Wednesday downgraded more than $13 billion of Salomon debtsecurities.   Salomon has stopped issuing commercial paper, orshort-term IOUs, and has been replacing it with repurchaseagreements backed by securities the firm owns.   Besides raising financing costs, funding with theserepurchase agreements ties up the firm's assets. Thispractice will hurt Salomon's ability to take tradingpositions, analysts and Wall Street executives saidyesterday. And that, they said, probably will crimp tradingprofit. Salomon has long made most of its profit throughtrading.   While acknowledging the increased cost of repurchaseagreements, Salomon insists its &quot;overall liquidity&quot; remainsstrong.   The Salomon spotlight will soon shift to Washington. ASenate Securities subcommittee has scheduled a Sept. 11hearing on the Salomon scandal and the government-securitiesmarket. Warren Buffett, Salomon's new interim chairman, isdue to testify along with Securities and Exchange CommissionChairman Richard Breeden and representatives of the Treasuryand Federal Reserve. The House Telecommunications and Financesubcommittee plans a similar hearing next Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
