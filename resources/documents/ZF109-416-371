Smith, senior vice president of Operations.andP;  &quot;We haveseen good customer response to our new products, including the VAX 9000series.andP;  The Company has continued to make significant investments in Randamp;D,capital spending, and our sales and sales support organizations, which arethe investments upon which long-term growth is based.&quot;andM;&quot;Increasing profit is the most important challenge the Company faces,&quot; statedSmith.andP;  &quot;We are not satisfied with our operating results and will continuefocusing on revenue growth and reducing our cost structure.andP;  One way we arereducing costs is to identify positions that are no longer needed, eitherbecause of technology changes or business practice changes.andP;  This isreflected in the year-to-year decline in the size of the Company'sworkforce.&quot;andM;&quot;Fourth quarter operating results include a restructuring charge of $400million, equal to $2.79 per share after tax, which reflects both current andfuture costs, principally for employee reskilling and separations, facilityconsolidations, and related administrative costs.andP;  We expect to beginreceiving ongoing cost savings from these actions in the current year, andthe full impact will be realized by next fiscal year,&quot; Smith noted.andM;DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORP.andM;REPORTS YEAR-END RESULTSandM;FOURTH QUARTER ENDED:andM;JUNE 30, 1990     JULY 1, 1989andM;PRODUCT SALES                   $2,064,687,000    $2,255,064,000andM;SERVICE andamp;
