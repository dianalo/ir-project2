(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   North America's longest rail tunnel, anine-mile stretch under Glacier National Park, has opened to linkCanada's coal and mineral-producing hinterland with the West Coastand the Pacific Rim countries.   The tunnel was inaugurated Thursday in a ceremony accented bythe sound of bagpipes and attended by rail executives,industrialists, politicians and some of the 1,100 railway workerswho worked on the $422 million project.   The new route, completed ahead of schedule and $84 million underbudget, ends the cumbersome practice of adding extra locomotives totrains that had to negotiate 4,000-foot Rogers Pass and shouldincrease westbound capacity by as much as 60 per cent, authoritiessay.   Major improvements, including the Mount Macdonald Tunnel,reduced the steepness so that pushers are no longer needed on thesoutheastern British Columbia route.   ``This is the biggest thing the railway has done since thebuilding of the transcontinental,'' said Barry Scott, chairman andchief executive officer of CP Rail.   CP Rail, a subsidiary of Canadian Pacific Ltd., can now runfour-locomotive freight trains from Calgary to Vancouver and,without the aid of the pusher trains, increase the number offreights through Rogers Pass daily from 15 to 24.   ``After nearly 104 years of railroading in these SelkirkMountains, we have finally tamed the geography _ or at least asmuch as man is ever likely to do,'' said Scott.   The project involved double-tracking the CP Rail main linethrough Rogers Pass. It was the last of four double-tracking andgrade-reduction projects undertaken by the railway in BritishColumbia and Alberta.   Lighter eastbound trains through Rogers Pass will use the oldtrack and the Connaught Tunnel, which opened in 1916. The new routealso will be used by passenger trains.   CP Rail officials say the project will have a significant impacton the ability to move export commodities such as grain, coal,sulphur and potash to the West Coast and the Pacific Rim.   ``This was built for the future,'' said Barry Scott, a seniorrailway spokesman. ``It's solid advance planning.''   CP Rail hopes to pay for it over 20 to 30 years depending onrevenues, but will realize savings immediately from the eliminationof about 20 pusher locomotives from service.</TEXT></DOC>
