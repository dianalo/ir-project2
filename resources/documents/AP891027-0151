Watkins, citingconcern over the stalled nomination of Victor Stello to headnuclear arms production, has put a close aide temporarily in chargeof the weapons office, according to an internal memorandum obtainedFriday.   In the memo dated Oct. 25, Watkins told Under Secretary JohnTuck, the No. 3 department official, to immediately take over asacting assistant secretary for defense programs.   ``... The vital national security mission of the department canno longer be carried out under the current managementarrangement,'' Watkins wrote in the memo.   Stello was nominated for the job July 24, but the Senate has noteven scheduled a confirmation hearing. Many environmental groupsand some prominent members of Congress are strongly opposed toStello, contending he is weak on nuclear safety.   Watkins has publicly defended Stello, and in the memo he said,``It is my hope that the nomination will be acted uponexpeditiously.'' He did not elaborate, except to say the stallednomination was creating a serious leadership vacuum.   In the memo, Watkins said John L. Meinhardt, who took the postof acting assistant secretary for defense programs earlier thisyear, had told him changes were needed.   ``I concur in his assessment that Defense Programs has operatedfar too long without the leadership and direction that can onlyevolve from a duly appointed and confirmed Assistant Secretary,''Watkins wrote.   Watkins told Tuck he would take on the additional title ofacting assistant secretary ``for the time being pendingconfirmation of the President's nominee to this important post.''   No mention was made of what job, if any, Meinhardt would take.   An aide to Meinhardt said he was not immediately available forcomment. Spokesmen for Watkins did not return a reporter's phonecalls.   The weapons office is in charge of a government complex of 17major nuclear facilities in 12 states that develop, build and testnuclear weapons for the Pentagon.   Stello has worked as a special assistant to Watkins on planningfor the restart of idled reactors at the Savannah River nuclearweapons complex since July. He came to the department from theNuclear Regulatory Commission, where he was chief of staff.   Greenpeace U.S.A., which has headed a national campaign to blockStello's nomination, applauded Watkins' decision to put Tucktemporarily in charge of the weapons program.   ``We take this as a tacit admission by the DOE of seriousproblems with Stello's nomination,'' said Stephen Schwartz, aGreenpeace spokesman in Washington.   Greenpeace sent a letter Friday to President Bush urgingwithdrawal of the Stello nomination.   ``There is absolutely no question that the urgent tasks facingthe DOE at its nuclear weapons production facilities demand anindividual of exceptional integrity and ability. Victor Stello isnot that individual,'' the letter said.</TEXT></DOC>
