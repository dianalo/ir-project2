The two men sought asylum, citing death threats following amilitary court decision last week to free 19 police and soldiersinvolved in the killing of 14 other Venezuelan fishermen on Oct. 29.   The Rev. Oswaldo Santana told reporters that Jose Arias andWolmer Pinilla went to the Vatican diplomatic mission late Monday,and were moved to a Roman Catholic church in the eastern slums ofCaracas, where they will receive ``unconditional protection.''   Santana, the church's human rights vicar, said they aredepending on the sanctity of the church to keep the men safe.   Arias and Pinilla said they survived the October shooting byjumping in a river and swimming to safety. They later sought asylumin Mexico, while a lower military court ruled them guilty of``military rebellion.''   In January, the military court declared Arias and Pinillainnocent and ordered the arrest of the 19. This followed acongressional investigation that declared the 14 dead men weremurdered and the military brigade had tried to cover up theiractions by accusing the fishermen of being Colombian guerrillas.   The highest rung of the military justice system last weekdeclared the lower military court had lacked authority, and freedthe 19 lawmen on a legal technicality.   A socialist congressman who supported the survivors, WalterMarquez, called the decision a ``legal prison break.''   Since the men were freed, Marquez said he, Arias and Pinilla,have got numerous anonymous telephone calls threatening theirlives. Local reporters following the case also reported receivingdeath threats.   ``This situation is extremely grave, not only for the lives ofthe two men, but also for the correct administration of justice,''Rev. Santana told reporters.   The Oct. 29 slayings had prompted four days of student riots inCaracas and elsewhere in which news reports said at least oneperson was killed and at least 57 were wounded. Church groups andhuman rights organizations worldwide sent letters of protest to thegovernment.   Also Tuesday, the Venezuelan Episcopal Conference of ``gravedangers'' facing democracy. They said Venezuelans have lost faithin the administration of justice and their political leadership.   In a document, the bishops called on corrupt Venezuelanpoliticians and businessmen to return billions of dollars illegallysiphoned from the country in the last 10 years.   In February, government-imposed price increases prompted riotsthat left at least 270 dead by official count. Unofficial sourcessay that death toll was as high as 2,000.</TEXT></DOC>
