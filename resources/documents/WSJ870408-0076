Gail Wilson, 38 years old, charged that she was fired from her job at the GM technical center in Warren, Mich., in 1981 after missing work because of complications arising from her pregnancy.    Her attorney said she testified that she was passed over for a promotion, placed in a remedial training program and then fired when she was absent from her job because of poor health.    A GM spokesman said, &quot;In our opinion, the evidence didn't support the jury's decision, and we'll be filing post-trial motions with the court to have the award set aside.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
