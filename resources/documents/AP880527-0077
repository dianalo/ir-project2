WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NATO defense ministers today pledged torenew efforts to share equitably in the costs of their commondefense. Congress has been complaining that the European allies arenot pulling their weight.   ``We are determined ... in ensuring that each of us contributesin the most effective and equitable fashion'' to NATO's jointdefense efforts, the ministers said in a statement at the end oftheir two-day meeting here.   They authorized NATO officials in Brussels to launch an in-depthreview of the responsibilities of the 16 member nations todetermine what changes, if any, must be made. The study is to becompleted by the end of the year.   In their statement, U.S. Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci andthe other North Atlantic Treaty Organization defense chiefs alsoexpressed support for President Reagan in his summit talks nextweek in Moscow.   The review of NATO's burden-sharing arrangement comes amidincreasingly harsh criticism from some U.S. lawmakers, criticismthe European allies counter by saying their contributions are beinggrossly underestimated.   ``The important thing about burden-sharing is that it notdegenerate to a finger-pointing exercise,'' Carlucci told reportersafter the meeting.   He said all NATO nations are committed to maintaining theirdefense spending and making better use of available funds.   The ministers also asked Italy to host a U.S. jetfighter wingthat Spain wants off its soil within three years.   ``All of us hope that the Italian government and parliament willbe able to accept'' the 72 nuclear-capable F-16 jetfighters, NATOSecretary General Lord Carrington said. A favorable Italiandecision is expected soon.   The planes, Carrington said, represent ``a considerable portionof our strength in the southern region.'' They make up the U.S. AirForce's 401st Tactical Fighter Wing, now based at the Torrejon airbase near Madrid.   The Pentagon has said it will have to disband the unit unless afinal decision on moving the planes to another European base ismade by August.   Carrington told reporters that hesitation by the allies inarranging the transfer of the F-16s ``would have had the mostappalling effect'' on alliance relations and U.S. congressionalattitudes toward Europe.   A decision on a specific Italian site for the planes is to bemade later.   Carlucci estimated the cost of relocating the planes at about$500 million.   The United States, under an accord reached in January withSpain, must remove its F-16s from the Torrejon base by 1991.   U.S. officials were hopeful the decision to keep the F-16s inEurope would help blunt congressional complaints the Europeansdon't pay enough for NATO.   Washington spends 6.7 percent of its gross national product tomaintain the alliance, compared with a 3.3 percent average for theEuropeans.   The European allies argue a comparison of money figures isunfair because some of Europe's contributions to NATO are hard toquantify.   These include the fact that West Germany and other countriessuffer extensive environmental damage from the intenseconcentration of troops and armaments on their soil.   The Europeans have released figures showing that of NATO'sactive duty forces, Europe provides 90 percent of the troops andartillery, 80 percent of the tanks and jetfighters and two-thirdsof the major warships.   The NATO defense ministers said they have found no evidenceMoscow is changing ``the doctrine and structure of Soviet forces.''   The ministers said the Soviet Union continues to maintainmilitary forces in excess of its defensive needs.   ``Soviet military expenditures are estimated to represent some15 to 17 percent of its GNP. The continuing growth of Sovietmilitary capabilities provides a persuasive reminder of the needfor a credible defense'' on NATO's part, the ministers said intheir communique.   Carlucci said, ``Despite their rhetoric, we have yet to see anychange'' in Soviet military outlays or in the composition of Sovietforces.</TEXT></DOC>
