With a NATO summit meeting due to open Monday in Brussels, theSoviet leader virtually accepted Western demands that ceilings beset on troop levels in each East European country as well as onSoviet forces overall.   Bush administration officials said the Soviet leader had agreedto negotiated ceilings on Soviet troops in Czechoslovakia, EastGermany, Hungary and Poland, and to an overall limitation on theRed Army.   That is, the officials said, Soviet forces could not exceed 35percent to 40 percent of the combined strength of the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Pact.   The two military alliances are in negotiations in Vienna overreductions in tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear armoriesacross the expanse of Europe. The new Soviet proposals wereoutlined on Tuesday in a closed meeting in the Austrian capital,said the officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   The Soviet negotiators also reiterated Gorbachev's proposals fordrastic cutbacks in troops and in several weapons categories. TheSoviet president and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze hadgiven the figures to Secretary of State James A. Baker III inMoscow two weeks ago.   Bush, in a speech Wednesday at the U.S. Coast Guard Academy inNew London, Conn., said, ``The Soviets are now being forthcomingand we hope to achieve the reductions that we seek.''   Referring to the specifics in the Soviet proposal, though, hesaid: ``These reductions alone, even if implemented, are not enoughto eliminate the superiority the Soviet Union enjoys now.''   Still, the moves by Gorbachev in response to long-standing U.S.demands were welcome news _ even though they add to the taskconfronting Bush and the other Western leaders in Brussels.   The alliance already is divided over whether to negotiatereductions in short-range nuclear missiles. West German ChancellorHelmut Kohl leads the countries pushing for U.S.-Soviet talks,while Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher are thestrongest foes of negotiations over the issue.   The United States and Britain argue that nuclear missiles arenecessary _ and must be made more menacing _ in order to deterSoviet attack from a Warsaw Pact that holds an edge in manpower andin some weapons categories.   Gorbachev's latest moves, however, reinforce the opposingargument that Soviet reductions are eroding any need forground-based Lance nuclear missiles as a deterrent.   Presure has been building on NATO since Gorbachev announced latelast year the Soviets would withdraw 5,000 tanks and 50,000 troopsfrom Central and Eastern Europe and cut Soviet forces by 500,000overall.   In January, he said defense spending would be slashed 14.2percent, although Soviet officials said later it was difficult tocalculate how much was being spent on armed forces.   And two weeks ago he told Baker he would unilaterally withdraw500 Soviet nuclear warheads from Eastern Europe.   Bush, in his speech Wednesday, urged the Soviets to ``open theledgers'' and provide accurate military spending figures. He alsorenewed his proposal for aerial inspections of troop concentrations.   Last month, Roald Sagdeyev, a leading Russian rocket scientistand prominent reformer, said the Kremlin would publish defensefigures and space budgets by the end of the year.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater sought to play down theimportance of the latest Soviet proposal, saying it was a responseto a plan proposed last March 9 by the United States and its NATOallies.   But Fitzwater said, ``The Soviets have provided details in ameaningful way at the negotiating table. It is a serious proposaland we look forward to the negotiations.''   Bush's response was a holding action until the NATO summitmeeting. Soviet proposals for cuts in non-nuclear forces require aresponse from the alliance itself, not the United States alone.   Still, Bush signaled a shift in tone.   ``The president felt he appeared too negative before, and he'strying to appear more positive now,'' said his national securityadviser, Brent Scowcroft.</TEXT></DOC>
