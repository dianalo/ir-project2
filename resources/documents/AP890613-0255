Edward Jay Epstein had been signed to write a book about MichaelMilken, the former Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executive who was apioneer in developing the junk bond market.   The book was one of several that Whittle plans to publish in whatit is tentatively calling its ``Larger Agenda'' series fordistribution to government and corporate leaders. The books will runabout 100 pages each and be sponsored by a single company whichWhittle has refused to identify.   However, Federal Express Corp. of Memphis has confirmed itintends to be a sponsor of the books.   Epstein recently submitted an outline of his book, but saidWhittle editor Anthony Kiser expressed concern about whetherWhittle's audience would like the line of argument he was advancing.   The author said he ``didn't feel comfortable with the kinds ofeditorial suggestions being made by the editorial director there.''He declined to go into what was being suggested and said he had noway of knowing the reasons for demanding the changes.   But Epstein said he had never run into such problems in writing11 other books with six different publishing companies in which noadvertiser was involved in the project.   William Rukeyser, editor-in-chief at Whittle Communications, saidthe advertiser had nothing to do with suggestions about Epstein'sbook outline.   ``It was entirely an editorial process,'' said Rukeyser, a formermanaging editor at Fortune magazine, adding he was ``outraged''anyone would suggest an advertiser was interfering.   ``He seemed to be proposing a book that would take the view thatMichael Milken's overall effect on the economy has been so healthy,the fact that he may have committed felonies didn't matter. We feltthat was not an intellectually or morally viable stance for the bookto to take,'' he said.   Milken has been indicted on federal securities fraud charges andcould face a trial next year.   Federal Express spokeaman Armand Schneider said from Memphis thatthe company has ``no editorial control over the books.''   ``The content is up to Whittle. We know the names of the authorsand the working titles, but that's all,'' he said.   Rukeyser said he did not think Epstein's withdrawal from theproject would affect Whittle's broader plans for single-advertiserbooks.   Whittle disclosed earlier this year it signed book contracts withnine authors including Epstein, John Kenneth Galbraith and DavidHalberstam.   The New York Times, which disclosed Epstein's withdrawal from theproject in Tuesday's editions, said Halberstam and another projectauthor, James Atlas, told the newspaper they had not experienced anyinterference in their books.   Rukeyser said two more authors he declined to identify have sincebeen signed. The first book could appear later this year withadditional books expected in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
