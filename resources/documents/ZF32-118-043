(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The NetWare Asynchronous Remote Router software formerly the NetWareAsynchronous Remote Bridge) allows multiple asynchronous communications linesto be installed on a network, providing connections with other remotenetworks at speeds of up to 9.6 Kbits/sec.andM;Even though Novell endeavors to make the router reliable, efficient, and easyto use, it is possible that you may run into some snags when configuring therouter for use on your network.andP;  To help you in your installation, we havecompiled the following list of tips for using the NetWare Asynchronous RemoteRouter v1.2.andP;  These suggestions and solutions should allow you to avoid someof the more common problems associated with the router.andM;1) The first release of NetWare V3.11 did not ship with the COM port drivers,so you will need to download a Product Temporary Fix (PTF) file fromCompuServe.andP;  Download PTF255.ZIP from the new uploads library (Library 16) ofNOVA.andP;  If you cannot find the file in Library 16, it may have already beenmoved to its permanent location in Library 9.andM;2) If you are using non-Hayes modems over 9600 baud, you must speciallyconfigure these modems.andP;  You must program the baud rate, set the modem toauto-answer, and configure it to expect the appropriate return result codes.andO;Consult your modem manual for specifics.andM;3) Note that the router now requires unique LAN addresses.andP;  Further, if youare working with NetWare v3.x, note that both the internal IPX addresses andthe LAN addresses must be unique.andP;  SLIST displays only the internal IPXaddresses.andM;4) If you are using NetWare v2.15 or earlier, be certain you are using thelatest version of IPX and the NetWare shell (v3.02 at this time).andM;5) If you receive the error INVALID ID STRING when dialing into the routerfrom a standalone PC, you should try the following troubleshooting process:andM;* If you are using a router version earlier than v1.2, upgrade to v1.2.andP;  Thisis particularly important if you are not using actual Hayes modems.andM;* Be certain you are matching the case of the ACONFIG password.andM;* When using ACONFIG, use the delete key to remove all ID strings andpasswords.andM;* If you selected &quot;Hayes Compatible,&quot; the modems may not be returning trueHayes codes.andP;  This may be because the modems are not set up properly or, eventhough they are supposedly Hayes-compatible, they may not be able to returntrue Hayes codes.andM;* The modems may be receiving noise.andP;  Have the telephone company check theline, and make certain the line does not have features like call waiting.andM;* Try lowering the baud rate.andM;6) If you are running the Asynchronous Router internally on a NetWare v2.xfile server, be certain the file server has at least 4MB of RAM.andP;  Otherwise,the LAN driver or WNIM+ may fail to initailize.andM;7) The NACSLOAD.BIN file is extremely important if you are using a WNIM+adapter as part of your router.andP;  if your router is internal, NACSLOAD.BINmust be located in the SYS:SYSTEM directory.andP;  If your router is external,NACSLOAD.BIN must reside where the ROUTER.EXE file resides.andM;Ernesto Bautista is a Communications Engineer at Novell, Inc. in Sunnyvale,CA.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
