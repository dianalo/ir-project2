Errors are rife in IRS correspondence, but the GeneralAccounting Office says service-center units that answerqueries and tell taxpayers of account adjustments seem to bereducing errors that affect accuracy and completeness. IRSdata show the national error rate falling to 14% of letterslast August from 24% in February 1990 and 38% in February1989. Rates fluctuate: The Atlanta unit's rose from 32% inFebruary 1990 to 44% in May, then fell to 9% in August.</LP><TEXT>   The IRS credits improvements to a better letter-composingsystem and to heightened &quot;quality reviews.&quot; Now those effortsare to be applied in other functions, such as audit,collection, and taxpayer service. The GAO also looked atnotices that return-processing units use to inform filersthat the IRS has corrected math and other mistakes on theirreturns. Errors in the notices are common, although reviewerscatch many before the notices are mailed.   But the GAO faults the IRS for not having better talliesof errors and for failing to identify causes of errors.                                                                                                          DEBT-CANCELLATION rules could prod more ailing companiesinto bankruptcy.   So argues William Mudd of Deloitte andamp; Touche, CPAs. Adebtor that cancels debt generally creates income for itself,except for debts discharged in bankruptcy. A 1980 law says adebtor also has income if a related party, such as its parentcompany, buys its discounted debt from a third party. The IRSproposed rules March 21 -- to take effect that day -- tocarry out the law; but they aren't limited to transactionsinvolving parties that already are related.   The rules also may apply if an unrelated party -- apotential rescuer, say -- buys a troubled company'sdiscounted debt in the market and later -- up to two yearslater -- becomes related by acquiring over 50% of its stock.Such deals were attracting more interest, but Mudd contendsthe rules will discourage them. He says many salvageableconcerns will choose bankruptcy to escape debt-cancellationincome and that bankruptcy will scare away potentialrescuers.                                                                                                          HEALTH BENEFITS of partners and S-corporation owners gettax clarification.   Employees generally aren't taxed on medical and otherfringe benefits; employers deduct the costs. But thetreatment hasn't been clear for working partners or similarlytaxed owner-employees holding over 2% of an S concern. Manyunderstood they were taxable on most of their firms' paymentsfor health insurance; others treated it all as tax-free. Inany event, many firms haven't been deducting the costs.   Now IRS Revenue Ruling 91-26 clarifies all this, saysSamuel Starr of Coopers andamp; Lybrand, CPAs. On one hand, the IRStreats payments for health and accident insurance as taxablecompensation to owner-employees (they still may deduct 25% ofthe premium). On the other, it makes clear that partnershipsand S concerns may deduct the costs. The ruling takes effectthis year.   While the ruling names only health and accident insurance,Starr says its reasoning should cover some other fringes,including group life insurance.                                                                                                          GERMANY PROTESTS it's prepared to compromise on issuesholding up activation of its tax treaty with the U.S., butsays they can't &quot;be passed over.&quot; A Treasury official hassaid the U.S. is &quot;dismayed&quot; by German delays. Disputes overestate taxes and extending the pact to Germany's new easternstates were to be resolved in supplemental talks. None arescheduled.                                                                                                          BYE BYE, FORM 4868. That's the application you must mail,with any tax owed, by April 15 to extend your return-filingdeadline to Aug. 15. But next year for 1991 returns,extensions will be automatic without applications, as long asyou make payments by April 15, 1992, that equal 90% of your1991 tax liability or 100% of 1990's.                                                                                                          HELL ON WHEELS: To promote the Volunteer Income TaxAssistance program for low-income and elderly filers, VITAworkers hopped a roller coaster in San Diego to prepare &quot;thefastest returns in history . . . at speeds approaching 65miles per hour.&quot;                                                                                                          CORPORATIONS FACE major restructuring to save taxes in theEurope of 1992.   Britain's budget signals that plans for a true EuropeanCommunity &quot;are falling into place,&quot; Eli Fink of Deloitte andamp;Touche says. Britain proposes to adopt EC rules that on Jan.1 will erase taxes on mergers and transfers of profits andassets across borders within the EC; other EC nations areexpected to follow suit. That will give EC-basedmultinationals a competitive tax jump on U.S. concerns thatformed separate subsidiaries in each nation to minimize theforeign and U.S. tax bite, Fink says.   U.S.-owned units will get the EC tax breaks, butaffiliated units may be subject to U.S. tax on transfers ofassets and profits among themselves. One solution: A singlesubsidiary with unincorporated branches. But many U.S.companies would like to keep the flexibility of nationalsubsidiaries and form EC holding companies to redeployEuropean capital. Trouble is, U.S. tax law can block that.Fink says U.S. companies need tax law letting them treatEurope as one nation, as European companies will.   This is one of the hottest issues for U.S. multinationals,Fink declares.                                                                                                          BRIEFS: A bill offered by Rep. Durbin (D., Ill.) andothers would require the IRS to include organ-donorinformation with refunds. . . . New York City has begunreporting to the IRS and state tax agencies its payments tosuccessful claimants against it; payments in 1990 totaled$9.4 million.</TEXT></DOC>
