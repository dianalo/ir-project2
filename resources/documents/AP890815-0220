Meanwhile, customers of the four Baby Bell companies continued toexperience minor delays on operator-assisted calls, but a unionspokesman said the strike by more than 190,000 employees would biteharder in time.   ``The strike certainly has not seriously affected service,'' JimO'Hare, president of Local 1118 of the Communications Workers ofAmerica in Albany, N.Y., said Monday.   ``But we know that after a while these machines that are runningwill show signs of lack of maintenance. You'll see more trouble astime goes on,'' he said.   CWA workers were in the second week of a strike against NewYork-based NYNEX Corp., Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic and SanFrancisco-based Pacific Telesis. Union members at Ameritech, whichhas its headquarters in Chicago, joined the walkout Sunday.   Members of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workersalso are on strike at NYNEX, Pacific Telesis and Bell Atlantic. Thestrikes affected customers in 20 states and the District of Columbia.   Bell Atlantic representatives presented a revised proposal tounion officials at an hour-long meeting Monday, but CWA spokesmanJim Willer said the company's health insurance offer was``unacceptable.'' Willer said the company continued to demand thatworkers pay deductibles plus half the premiums for relatives otherthan spouses and children.   Efforts to shift some health care costs onto workers are a keyissue in the four strikes.   The three other regional phone companies _ Atlanta-basedBellSouth, Denver-based US West and St. Louis-based SouthwesternBell _ have reached settlements. The seven Baby Bells were formed inthe 1984 breakup of American Telegraph andamp; Telephone Co.   No talks were scheduled at Ameritech, which serves 12.3 millioncustomers in five Midwestern states.   CWA officials in Illinois, Ohio, Michigan, Indiana and Wisconsinsaid their bargaining committees would meet Thursday in Detroit toplot strategy before seeking any talks with Ameritech subsidiariesin their states.   ``I don't expect any talks before the end of the week,'' said L.Keith Dooley, co-chairman of the Indiana bargaining committee.``Right now I would say we're still a long ways off from getting acontract.''   Ameritech subsidiaries have offered a three-year contract with animmediate increase of 5 percent, most of which would come in theform of a $1,000 signing bonus for lower-paid employees. Base wageswould increase 2 percent in 1990 and 1991, said Larry Cose, aspokesman for Illinois Bell.   The CWA said the offer would do little for lower-paid operatorsand clerks.   ``The base pay has to increase enough to make it worthwhile forpeople to work there,'' said Greg Kenefick, a CWA spokesman inCleveland.   Meanwhile, NYNEX picket Edward G. Horgan, 34, was hospitalized incritical condition after a picket line accident in the New Yorksuburb of Mount Pleasant.   Police Chief Paul Oliva said an 18-year-old NYNEX employee wasdriving on the service road of a NYNEX facility when her car brushedHorgan, after he and several other pickets gathered around her carand yelled at her.   Horgan mounted the hood of the slowly moving car and pounded onthe windshield, but slid off and hit his head on the pavement,police said. The union disputed that, saying he fell onto the hoodand the young woman accelerated. No charges were filed.   New York Telephone Co. President Fred Salerno called the accident``tragic'' and asked the union to resume negotiations ``to try andcalm the waters.''   In other incidents:   _ A NYNEX car was burned shortly after midnight Monday in acompany parking lot in Elmont, N.Y. Police said the fire wassuspicious.   _ Four strikers were arrested at a New York Telephone facility inCatskill, 40 miles south of Albany, when they ignored policebarricades.   _ Two people were arrested outside Michigan Bell offices in theDetroit suburb of Southfield. Officer Gary Conat said one allegedlyobstructed a police officer, but he wasn't sure about allegationsagainst the other.   _ Toll and 911 service was cut off to about 8,000 customers inWest Virginia after vandals cut 11 cables. Residents in the area arestill able to dial police or fire directly, Candamp;P Telephone of WestVirginia said.</TEXT></DOC>
