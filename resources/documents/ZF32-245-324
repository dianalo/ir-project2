(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Mac color consistency from the monitor to output may be on the horizon asseveral new color-calibration products have adopted the CIE standard.andM;By Steve HannafordandM;Before the Mac can become a widely accepted professional color pre-presstool, the industry needs a device-independent, mathematical way to definecolor that will allow consistency among monitors, scanners, output devicesand eventually the printing press itself.andP;  A spectrum of newcolor-calibration products reflects that need.andM;Without a common definition, color information is lost or radicallytransformed when it goes from one device to another in the production chain,so what started as baby blue on the scanner can end up as aquamarine orindigo on the page.andM;Ronn Campisi, a publications designer in Boston, described, at the Grafix '90conference held last month in New York, his encounter with the problem: &quot;Ihave three Macs in my office, each with the same SuperMac monitor, andsometimes colors in a certain file will look different on each monitor.&quot;andO;Campisi, like many color users, is a good candidate for one of the newcalibration systems.andM;CIE color standard.andP;  Manufacturers hope that, by defining colors in relationto the CIE (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) color standard (seestory below), these disruptions can be minimized.andP;  The basic objective is tomatch what is scanned in to what is displayed on the monitor and what isdisplayed to what is ultimately printed -- in other words, WYSIWYG color.andM;Until now, products have addressed only a small piece of the calibrationpuzzle.andP;  Recent developments, however, have wider-ranging applications.andO;Several products of interest to Macintosh color users already have beenreleased or announced.andM;andgt;RasterOps Corp. of Santa Clara, Calif., continues to offer its Calibrator, amonitor-and-calibration system that allows the user to get consistent,CIE-based color settings among similar monitors as well as among worksessions on the same machine.andP;  An optical sensor is used to analyze thescreen output and adjust it to a predefined level.andP;  List price for the systemis $12,695.andM;andgt;Tektronix Inc. of Wilsonville, Ore., offers TekColor for the Macintosh 1.1,device-independent color-matching software using a CIE-compatible standardthat allows users to match displayed colors within specific applications toprinted output.andP;  It tells application software which displayed colorsactually can be printed on a given device.andP;  The software retails for $50.andM;andgt;SuperMac Technology of Sunnyvale, Calif., uses the Tektronix matchingtechnology for its SuperMatch system.andP;  SuperMatch is system-level softwarethat comes with SuperMac color-display adapters and an optional hardwarecalibrator.andP;  The system works with a range of color monitors from SuperMac aswell as those from Apple, Radius Inc. and RasterOps.andP;  Endorsement for theSuperMatch technology also has come from other manufacturers, including SharpElectronics Corp. of Mahwah, N.J.; Seiko Instruments USA Inc. of San Jose,Calif.; and QMS Inc.'s Electronic Publishing Group of Mobile, Ala., all ofwhich plan to support the SuperMatch system in their scanners and printers.andO;SuperMac's 24-bit-display adapters start at $799, and the color calibratorlists at $699.andM;andgt;Radius Inc. of San Jose, Calif., manufactures the PrecisionColor Calibrator,which calibrates color monitors for the use of Pantone colors.andP;  The companyhas worked out CIE-compatible data on the correct appearance of Pantonecolors and translated the data to conform to the characteristics of specificmonitors.andP;  Radius uses an optical sensor that reads the monitor's output andmakes adjustments as necessary to display the correct colors.andP;  ThePrecisionColor Calibrator lists for $695.andM;andgt;Electronics for Imaging Inc. of San Bruno, Calif., has announced a line ofproducts for calibrating colors on Mac systems, based on a CIE-compatiblemodel.andP;  These include a set of OEM software modules that tie applicationsoftware and printer controllers to a color-translation database to maintainconsistent color among software and devices.andP;  The modules are available toapplication developers.andP;  EFI says it plans to release a controller midyearthat allows Canon color copiers to be used as calibrated PostScript printers.andO;Finally, EFI plans a hardware-and-software system to ensure color calibrationand fidelity through to the printing press; the system is expected to beavailable late this year.andM;andgt;Savitar Inc. of San Francisco has announced the SpectraPlate system forcalibrating scanners and digital cameras to the CIE standard.andP;  The firstproduct in the line, SpectraPlate/35 (expected in the first quarter of thisyear), includes a factory-calibrated &quot;target device&quot; and software.andP;  Thedevice, which looks like a 35mm slide, is actually a pair of sophisticatedoptical filters that serve as a reference, enabling the software to adjustthe scanner.andP;  Nikon Inc., Electronic Imaging Division, based in Melville,N.Y., recently announced its adoption of the Savitar product for calibratingits 35mm LS-3500 slide scanner.andP;  Savitar plans to release a variety ofcalibration products based on the SpectraPlate system.andM;All together now.andP;  What promises to tie all these products together is AdobeSystems Inc.'s announcement of support for the CIE standard.andP;  The MountainView, Calif., company has announced support for the CIEABC color model inPostScript Level 2, the latest incarnation of Adobe's device-independentgraphics language, expected in the first quarter of this year.andP;  Adoption ofthe CIE model will allow PostScript devices (especially output devices) toaccept a wide variety of standardized color definitions from other programsbeyond the device-dependent RGB (red, green, blue) and CMYK (cyan, magenta,yellow, black) color models that PostScript already handles.andM;Jim King, manager of advanced product development at Adobe, said, &quot;Level 2will have an accommodating design when it comes to accepting color data.&quot;andO;PostScript drivers will be able to translate images defined in a number ofCIE-compatible color coordinates and render them as well as possible, giventhe characteristics of the output device.andM;The first implementation of Level 2 drivers is due with the release of Level2 itself, and it may take some time before they are widely available.andO;Application software capable of handling the new color information will notspring up overnight, and a large number of compatibility issues will have tobe resolved.andP;  Nor will existing calibration products automatically be madefully compatible with PostScript.andM;Said Steve Guttman, product marketing manager for Adobe: &quot;It will probably bea year or so before we have wide acceptance of the new (PostScript) standard.andO;We're hoping availability of new versions of software will be fairlysimultaneous.&quot;andM;Eastman Kodak Co.'s announcement of its PhotoYCC standard for definingelectronic color images, which was made available to developers late lastyear, has significantly energized the search for color consistency.andP;  ThisCIE-based standard initially will be used to store and compress color photoimages that will be delivered on optical discs for viewing on TV screens.andO;But while it targets the broad consumer market, Kodak, based in Rochester,N.Y., also is making provisions for PostScript pre-press and high-end imagingmarkets.andP;  The company has been working closely with Adobe, and compatibilitybetween this scheme and the output requirements for PostScript Level 2 isexpected.andP;  The target release date for the Kodak products is sometime in1992.andM;Kodak's new film-processing technology is likely to spawn a wide set ofhardware and software products in publishing, film and home entertainment.andO;&quot;Kodak's announcement legitimizes the whole concept of calibration to anindependent color space,&quot; said Savitar President Rudy Burger.andM;Given the promise of a greatly expanded market for CIE-compatible hardwareand software, this is one standards war likely to be decided quickly andclaim few casualties.andM;The CIE standard for defining color has existed since 1931.andP;  Used in thepaint and dye industries, it provides a mathematical model for defining colorspace, the relationship of colors to one another in terms of 3-D coordinates.andM;Those three dimensions can be defined in different ways, accounting for themany different systems compatible with the standard: CIEXYZ, CIEY, CIELAB,CIEL, CIEABC, TekHVC, rationalized RGB and PhotoYCC.andP;  PostScript Level 2 willsupport most, if not all, of these systems.andM;The key concept is that any set of CIE-compatible coordinates can betranslated easily into another.andM;The Kodak scheme favors a set of coordinates with brightness along one axisand color intensity along the other two.andP;  Tektronix uses hue, saturation andvalue as coordinates.andP;  Other schemes use a more standardized version of theRGB system of color values common on monitors and printers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
