Their legislation, with proposals ranging from developing safernuclear power to minimizing destruction of Third World forests,represents the broadest Capitol Hill response yet to warnings fromscientists about the so-called greenhouse effect.   ``The greenhouse effect is the most significant economic,political, environmental and human problem facing the 21stCentury,'' said Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., the principal author ofpackage.   Joining him at a news conference was Bennett Johnston, D-La.,the energy chairman who has over the years been identified morewith energy development and production than with environmentalprotection.   Johnston, who recently held a hearing on the greenhouse effect,said that ``the evidence of global warming is virtually undeniable.It is so much more comprehensive, dangerous and life-changing thananything we've ever seen.''   Aides said that Johnston has become convinced that global actionis necessary to combat the production of carbon and othergreenhouse gases that scientists say trap heat in the atmosphere,threatening major changes in climate and higher ocean levels.   Johnston, who said he would hold more hearings in coming weeks,stopped short of endorsing a key element of Wirth's proposal:requiring new car fleets to average 55 miles per gallon by 2010, ordouble the 1985 fuel efficiency standard.   The legislation would force this country to reduce carbondioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2000. Scientists estimate thatcarbon dioxide, coming mostly from fossil fuel combustion, producesabout half the greenhouse effect. The United States is said to beresponsible for 20 percent of the world's carbon dioxide emissions.   The proposal would require administration officials to draft anational energy plan emphasizing least-cost ways of reducing fossilfuel use and increasing use of renewables such as solar energy.   The package would authorize about $1 billion through 1992 forresearch and development of non-fossil energy sources and a newgeneration of safer and cheaper nuclear reactors. It also calls forgreater reliance on cleaner-burning natural gas for heating andtransportation.   On the international front, the secretary of state would beurged to hold an international meeting aimed at getting othernations to commit to a 50 percent cut in greenhouse gas productionby 2015.   The legislation would authorize this country to spend more than$1.5 billion in the early 1990s to provide birth controlinformation in an effort to slow the demand for fossil fuels inburgeoning nations.   It also calls for the United States to work throughinternational lending and development agencies to slow thedestruction of forests, which consume carbon dioxide when alive butwhich emit huge amounts when they are cut down.   Johnston said that to slow pollution in the Third World, ``we'regoing to have to pay for their non-development in some way, andit's going to be expensive.''   He said that in 1989, ``we'll have to begin the serious processof legislating. We'll act as fast as the public's willing tosupport us.''   Johnston said that economic interests like automakers and coalproducers ``must understand that this is not a passing fad, thatit's not going to go away. This will not change withadministrations. It's not a Democratic-Republican issue. It's not aliberal-conservative issue. And I'm not sure we can solve it.''   Joining as cosponsors were Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Jeff Bingaman,D-N.M.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; John Chafee, R-R.I.; John Danforth,R-Mo.; Wyche Fowler, D-Ga.; Albert Gore, D-Tenn.; John Heinz,R-Pa.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; John Melcher, D-Mont.; ClaibornePell, D-R.I.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Terry Sanford, D-N.C.; andRobert Stafford, R-Vt.   The package was introduced a day after Stafford, Baucus, Chaffeeand David Durenberger, R-Minn., submitted legislation to end allU.S. production and use of chlorofluorocarbons by 1999. Thesechemicals contribute to global warming as well as destroying theozone layer that shields the Earth from the sun's cancer-causingultraviolet rays.   Their bill would also force power plants to reduce emissions ofthe pollutants that cause acid rain and require new homes tocontain the most efficient heating and cooling systems available.</TEXT></DOC>
