So polarizing are the arguments over abortion, whether personalor political, they can separate the warmest of lovers, young adultsfrom parents and grandparents, priests from their parishioners,officeholders from their jobs.   Some women, even some men, are separated from their sanity.Suicide or years of melancholy are not unheard of, either as theconsequence of a lamented abortion or of a struggling mother'sanguish over her inability to provide for a child, perhaps woefullydeformed or handicapped, that she has brought into the world.   The ethical complexities wear thick for some Americans, thin forothers. Some find their answers in faith, some in science, and somein lonely desperation. At the heart of the furor is the question ofwhether human life begins with a baby's first breath, or ninemonths earlier with the microscopic conjunction of sperm and egg,or somewhere in between with the emergence of a ``viable'' fetus.   At the fringe of that theological and scientific riddle are theironies of fervor _ ``pro-life'' fanatics, for example, who riskmurder by bombing abortion clinics; or militant mothers, childrenproudly in tow, marching for abortion rights.   Each side claims the truth as its ally, and thus they agree onprecious few facts. But there is little argument about this:Millions of American women, about one-fifth of those older than 15,have had, and will have, abortions. According to the AlanGuttmacher Institute, a birth-control research group in New YorkCity, 1.6 million abortions are performed annually. Nearlyone-third of all pregnancies end in abortion.   The issue separates the president of the United States from themainstream of public opinion, from the Congress and even from hispersonal physician, Burton J. Lee III, who believes each woman isentitled to decide for herself whether to bear a child.   It also separates President Bush from the George Bush of adecade ago, before he got religion from Ronald Reagan. In 1980, heopposed Reagan's idea of a constitutional amendment to overturn theSupreme Court's Roe vs. Wade decision. Now, against all politicalodds, he supports such an amendment.   Other conservatives aren't waiting for a constitutional revision_ which, to be realistic, is nowhere on the political horizon.Instead, Reagan's Supreme Court has itself begun chipping away atthe ``Roe'' decision, the 1973 effort by Justice Harry Blackmun tobalance the government's interest in protecting life and a woman'sright to determine when _ and whether _ to have a child. At leastsix states have new anti-abortion laws ready to take hold, pendinga go-ahead from the court.   As a quiet battle rages within the justices' chambers, theskirmishes outside the door are deafening. Advocates on either sidehave marched by the tens of thousands upon the court, Congress,state legislatures and even city halls. They wave blue-and-whiteplacards, with black-and-white aphorisms, frequently more insultthan idea. It is a single-issue crusade: Neither side much concedesvoters should judge anyone, president or sheriff or dogcatcher, byany other standard. To one side, you are either ``pro-life' or youcondone or commit murder. To the other, you are either``pro-choice'' or you are willing to trample a woman's rights andthreaten her health or even life.   The Roe decision entitled all women to have abortions for anyreason within the first three months of pregnancy. In upholding arestrictive Missouri law last summer, one declaring that lifebegins at conception, the latest court re-opened the door for acornucopia of state efforts to legislate the issue.   George Bush would allow only those women whose lives arethreatened by pregnancy, or those who are the victims of rape orincest, to have abortions. But he will not sign federal legislationto enable the poorest of sexually assaulted women to abort theirfetuses at government expense. In his view, tax dollars should notbe used to ``compound a violent act with the taking of an unbornlife.''   Rep. Thomas C. Sawyer, D-Ohio, bitterly summarized thepresident's position this way: ``He would give his daughter _ oryours or mine _ every option. ... But if they cannot afford adoctor, they must carry the unborn of that hateful act to term _they have no choice.''   Sadly, even the most destitute women do have an abortion choice_ of sorts. It is essentially the same desperate option exercisedby many young, unmarried women back in the days when most statesbanned abortions _ and when unwed mothers faced ostracism and couldbe forced to turn their babies over for adoption. For them, anabortion meant squalid procedures, sometimes self-administered,with knitting needles, bleach and coat-hangers. For some, it meantdeath.   ``Women will have abortions, legal or not,'' says Molly Yard,president of the National Organization for Women. ``The question iswhether they will be legal, medically safe and available to everywoman who needs one.''   The vast majority of abortions are performed within the first 12weeks of pregnancy, at walk-in clinics charging an average of only$225 or so. Despite the modest cost, many women appear to beresorting even now to amateur methods. Health officials in bigcities are finding that some are intentionally using crack cocaineto induce uterine contractions. Others are trying megadoses ofvitamin C, exotic herbs, and a menstrual extraction method using aMason jar, aquarium tubing and other paraphernalia.   Today's do-it-yourself techniques can be as hazardous as the oldcoat-hanger abortions, physicians say. Moreover, they sometimesdamage the fetus rather than kill it. Drug-induced contractions canseparate the placenta from the uterine wall, causing oxygendeprivation and a brain-damaged, rather than aborted, fetus.Cocaine can trigger a heart attack in the mother, or cause the babyto be born a drug addict.   A woman who has plenty of money needn't worry about either hersafety or legal risk, no matter what course local jurisdictionstake. Some states, like New York, California, Washington andHawaii, seem certain to keep abortion legal for the indefinitefuture. And there are always clinics to be found overseas; inFrance, for example, a simple pill, known as the RU-486, can beused to end pregnancy within five weeks of conception.   But the travel alternative, while easy enough for the careerwoman or affluent housewife with a pocketbook full of credit cards,is out of the question for ghetto teen-agers, or welfare mothersalready struggling to support a roomful of kids. Thus the abortiondebate, while usually couched in medical or theological terms, hasa number of troubling class and racial overtones.   According to the Guttmacher Institute, women below the povertylevel are more than three times as likely to have abortions aswomen whose incomes exceed $25,000. An astonishing number, about500,000 a year, are teen-agers. And because many lack access tomedical care early in pregnancy, they are more prone to seekabortions in later stages _ when more legal restrictions are nowpossible.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
