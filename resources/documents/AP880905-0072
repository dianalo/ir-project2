If convicted,he could face death by firing squad.   The trial of Yuri Churbanov, 51, a former first deputy interiorminister, is in line with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's driveto break with the cronyism and corruption now seen as endemic underBrezhnev, Communist Party chief from 1964 until his death in 1982.   The case against Churbanov and eight co-defendants, being heardby a three-member military tribunal of the Soviet Supreme Court,may also have a political aim _ to discredit remaining members ofthe Kremlin Old Guard who flourished under Brezhnev, or to signalthat their time has passed.   As the reading of the charges began, a court officer said that,``abusing his official position, (Churbanov) repeatedly took bribesfrom Interior Ministry and Communist Party officials inUzbekistan,'' the Central Asian republic that has been the centerof the corruption scandal.   Churbanov, who worked as a mechanic before taking a low-levelInterior Ministry job in 1961, was accused of accepting bribestotaling 656,883 rubles ($1.04 million), some of them fromco-defendants.   That sum is the equivalent of 270 years' pay for the averageSoviet factory worker. Churbanov also was accused of accepting acarpet, tea sets, wine, cognac, grapes and pomegranates thatreportedly were flown to him from Uzbekistan.   During the reading of the charges, it was repeatedly allegedthat Churbanov received the bribes due to his connection withBrezhnev, and at one point a co-defendant was quoted as tellinginvestigators he gave Churbanov money because ``he was a veryinfluential man.''   Churbanov is ``an example of the `stagnation period,' when aperson reached high position not because of his merits but due tohis family connections,'' the party daily newspaper Pravda saidlast week.   ``Glasnost and democracy will help to avoid Churbanovism andanything similar to it,'' Pravda said.   Court opened at 10 a.m. with Churbanov and the others sitting inthe dock guarded by five young soldiers from the Interior Ministry.   Access to the courtroom was limited, with only a few foreignreporters permitted to attend. The Soviet news agency Tass reportedthat the eyes of the senior guardsman, in his 20s, ``open wide eachtime the figure of another bribe is mentioned.''   The dark-haired Churbanov, dressed in a gray jacket andcollarless black shirt, was pale, but stared straight ahead, hishead held high.   Asked by the presiding judge, Army Maj. Gen. Mikhail Marov, tostand and identify himself, Churbanov spoke in a barely audiblevoice. When he said he was a former Communist Party member, Marovasked him if he had been expelled, and Churbanov answered, ``Inconnection with the present case.''   Churbanov's attorney, Andrei Makarov, accused the prosecutor,Maj. Gen. Alexander Sboyev, of prejudicing the case against theaccused in an Aug. 14 Moscow News article.   In an interview published last week by the same newspaper,Makarov said some Soviet media have made Churbanov a scapegoat forall the ills of the Brezhnev era, and that the accounts give himthe impression ``that Brezhnev is being tried under the name ofChurbanov.''   The trial is expected to last at least six weeks.   Churbanov, who married Brezhnev's daughter Galina in 1971, is ontrial with eight former Uzbekistan officials also accused of takingbribes: Interior Minister Khaidar Yakhyaev, 61, his deputies PyotrBegelman and T. Kakhramanov, and regional police chiefs identifiedonly as S. Sabirov, Kh. Norbutaev, D. Dzhamalov, M. Norov and Ya.Makhamadzhanov.   The trial's first day ended dramatically at 6 p.m. whenNorbutaev, who had complained earlier of feeling ill, suffered anapparent heart attack. Norbutaev clutched his chest and writhed inpain as two doctors administered to him.   The judge then adjourned the session until Tuesday.   According to Pravda, beginning in the 1970s cotton harvests inUzbekistan were padded by almost 1 million tons annually, with thegovernment made to pay for the non-existent crop by corruptofficials including Uzbek party boss Sharaf Rashidov, who died in1983.   ``Today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole morethan 4 billion rubles ($6.34 billion) from the state, half of whichthey stuffed into their own pockets,'' Pravda reported earlier thisyear.   Churbanov, who held the rank of colonel general in theMoscow-based ministry responsible for police and law enforcement,was a power-hungry epicure who became a key actor in shielding theracket, Pravda claimed.   Officials announced Churbanov's arrest in February 1987. He wasfired from his top-level Interior Ministry job in 1984, butreportedly was employed as deputy chief of political administrationfor the ministry's uniformed security troops until September 1986.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady Gerasimov said last week thatChurbanov may get the death penalty if convicted because he ischarged with serious economic crimes. People sentenced to death bySoviet courts are shot by a firing squad.</TEXT></DOC>
