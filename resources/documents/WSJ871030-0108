Therein lies a lesson for today's White House. If Republicans are to avoid Edward Heath's fate, President Reagan must move forcefully to restore confidence in the dollar.    Stock and bond markets recovered yesterday; partly because the House tax-increase package faltered. (It regained life after the market's early close.) The dollar firmed a bit against gold and some currencies, but a continued fall against the yen and mark signified that foreign exchange markets still are ruled by uncertainty.    President Reagan has failed to calm markets by reaffirming the Louvre agreement, in part because it isn't entirely clear what was agreed to. Also, leaks suggesting that the U.S. really wants a further dollar decline still filter out of Washington. How else can you explain European Community President Jacques DeLors's comment that the U.S. was prepared to let the dollar fall to 1.6 marks?    Further fuel for market nervousness comes from monetarist floating rate enthusiasts, who still hold important positions in Washington, and from arguments that driving down the currency will help the U.S., though it hurt Britain and every other nation that ever tried it. Former economic adviser Martin Feldstein wants the dollar to seek its &quot;natural&quot; level, as if dollars spawn like salmon.    To calm the markets, the president should heed the advice of French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur and Republican presidential candidates Jack Kemp and Robert Dole. They want an economic summit to remove all ambiguities about policy. This weekend would not be too soon.    Currency stabilization will require that the U.S. Fed, through its open market operations, begin withdrawing some of the liquidity it provided during the market crash. Anyone worried about the effect on interest rates should hark back to the 1970s when we had a really soft dollar, 14% inflation and 21% interest rates.    Rep. Kemp asked the president on Tuesday to meet at once with Chancellor Kohl and Prime Minister designate Takeshita, to let &quot;the world see you reaffirming the Louvre agreement, rejecting further dollar devaluation as a dangerous return to the inflationary polices of the 1970s.&quot; Mr. Kemp believes the Japanese and Germans now might be more willing to stimulate their economies. The President could reassure them in turn by &quot;withdrawing White House support for the terrible trade bill now in Congress and heading your way.&quot;    Surely we now know that dollar and stock-market weakness go hand in hand. Hence, the political risks of manipulating currencies outweigh benefits. America's weak dollar policy has failed to cure its trade deficit, or anything else. Whatever comfort the Japanese and Germans draw from that is outweighed by the vicissitudes they have visited upon themselves by their uncooperativeness.    If currency volatility is bad politically, it can only follow that currency stability should be the policy goal. There is really only one economy, the world economy. Economic processes remain healthy only insofar as they are based on reliable money. The fact that world commerce and investment are based on several currencies, not just one, does not change that principle. It only means that those currencies must be coordinated in such a way as to supply sufficient liquidity to the world economy without supplying too much. The best way and perhaps the only way is by measuring money against goods -- that is to say by prices. The dollar weakened against sensitive commodity prices such as gold this year, as well as by comparison with other major currencies, and the trouble began.    The fact that the U.S. dollar dominates world markets has for many years placed a special responsibility on the U.S. Every time that responsibility has been shirked the U.S. has paid a price in lost wealth and prestige. Nationalistic policies, such as competitive devaluations and interestrate wars, have been costly as well.    If international attention now is focused on the fundamental importance of money the market turmoil will have served a purpose. Crashes are no fun but sometimes it takes something like that to get the attention of policy makers. </TEXT></DOC>
