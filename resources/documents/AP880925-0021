The city installed permanent barriers earlier in the day at theentrances to several downtown subway stops to prevent entry to thestations after the subways stop running at night.   Homeless people had used the areas for shelter at night, butcity transit officials complained that they also littered thestations and used them as a bathroom in the morning.   ``This is intended to permit the authority to continue toprovide a clean and safe transit environment for riders andemployees,'' said Beverly Silverberg, spokeswoman for theWashington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.   Snyder said his group, the Community for Creative Non-Violence,would meet to decide how to respond.   ``I think it's absolutely revolting,'' especially with theapproach of cold weather, he said. ``What they've done is to drivea fair number of people away from those cracks and corners wherethey found a little bit of warmth.''   Metro officials placed temporary grates at the entrance of onedowntown stop last year, to block entry after the subway stationclosed at night. Homeless activists responded with protests andsit-ins.   The permanent barriers, electronic garage-type doors anddecorative bars, replaced the temporary structure at that stationand were installed at three other stations, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
