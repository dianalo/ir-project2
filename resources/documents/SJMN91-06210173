If an insurer was rated Aandplus; by the rating service A.M. Bestand had held that position for the past ten years, you could buy withconfidence. Aandplus; is the top safety rating Best gives.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  JUDGE INSURERS BY TWO RATINGS  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Personal Finance;  Jane Bryant Quinn writes about personal finance from NewYork.;  SETTING THE RECORD STRAIGHT (publ. 8/4/91, pg. 2E);  Because of anerror by Standard andamp; Poor's, Jane Bryant Quinn's column last Sunday misstatedMutual Benefit Life Insurance's rating. Sandamp;P had rated the insurer triple-A asrecently as May 1990.  </MEMO><TEXT>     But with the collapse of the giant Mutual Benefit Life Insurance Co. in NewJersey, that method has been shot full of holes. Best had consistently blessedMutual Benefit with the holy Aandplus;. Mutual's rating wasn't lowered until 16 daysbefore the company gave up the ghost.;    In the aftermath of the debacle,Best senior vice president Paul Wish conceded that his firm had known for sometime about Mutual Benefit's deteriorating real-estate investments. But as longas Mutual Benefit was solvent, Wish said, Best didn't want to add to its woesby lowering its safety rating. It believed the insurer could successfullyrehabilitate itself.;    Obviously, A.M. Best was wrong. And just asobviously, consumers are wrong in blindly trusting an Aandplus; rating. There arehonest Aandplus;'s and trust-me Aandplus;'s, and no outsider can tell which is which.;    Soyou need some new rules for using insurance-company safety ratings, and herethey are:;    (check) Don't buy from an insurance company that is safety-rated only by A.M. Best. Demand a second opinion from at least one of theother two major firms that study insurance- company solvency, Moody's andStandard andamp; Poor's. Your agent can tell you the rating.;    (check) Buy onlyfrom a company that commands the very top rating. That would be Aandplus; from Best,AAA from Standard andamp; Poor's and Aaa from Moody's. Applying this rule would havekept you out of Mutual Benefit Life. The company never earned a triple-Arating from either Sandamp;P or Moody's.;    What if you're already with an insurerwhose ratings are lower than triple-A? It's easy to switch to a strongercompany.;    But tax-deferred annuities and cash-value life-insurance policiesare a tougher call. You'll pay a penalty to switch, which reduces the cash inyour account. You might rather gamble on leaving these policies where theyare.;    If your company fails, all is not lost. Industry-financed guarantyfunds promise to step in if your insurer ultimately cannot pay.;    The amountof this coverage varies by state. But in general, you're protected forannuities and cash-values up to $100,000, death benefits up to $300,000 and amaximum of $300,000 for all combined claims. All states have, or are about toget, guaranty funds.;    One big problem: Guaranty funds don't ride to therescue right away. But in the future, guaranty funds may pay more swiftly,said Eden Sarfaty, executive director of the National Organization of Life andHealth Insurance Guaranty Associations.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Jane Bryant Quinn column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910728  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  8E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  523  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, July 28, 199100210173,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
