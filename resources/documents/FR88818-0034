Sparrowe, Chief, Officeof Migratory Bird Management, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Washington,DC 20240.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July3, 1918 (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 <T3>et seq.</T3>), authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior,having due regard for the zones of temperature and for the distribution,abundance, economic value, breeding habits, and times and lines of flightof migratory game birds, to determine when, to what extent, and by whatmeans such birds or any part, nest or egg thereof may be taken, hunted,captured, killed, possessed, sold, purchased, shipped, carried, exportedor transported.In the July 22, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 27728), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service(hereinafter the Service) proposed special migratory bird hunting regulationsfor the 1988-89 hunting season for certain Indian tribes, under the interimguidelines described in the June 4, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (at 50 FR 23467). The guidelines were developedin response to tribal requests for Service recognition of their reservedhunting rights, and for some tribes, recognition of their authority toregulate hunting by both tribal members and nonmembers on their reservations.The guidelines include possibilities for: (1) On-reservation hunting byboth tribal members and nonmembers, with hunting by nontribal members onsome reservations to take place within Federal frameworks but on datesdifferent from those selected by the surrounding State(s); (2) on-reservationhunting by tribal members only, outside of usual Federal frameworks forseason dates and length, and for daily bag and possession limits; and (3)off-reservation hunting by tribal members on ceded lands, outside of usualframework dates and season length, with some added flexibility in dailybag and possession limits. In all cases, the regulations established underthe guidelines would have to be consistent with the March 10-September1 closed season mandated by the 1916 Migratory Bird Treaty with Canada.Tribes that desired special hunting regulations in the 1988-89 huntingseason were requested in the January 21, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 1645) to submit a proposal that includeddetails on: (1) Requested season dates and other regulations to be observed;(2) harvest anticipated under the requested regulations; (3) methods thatwill be employed to measure or monitor harvest; (4) steps that will betaken to limit level of harvest, where it could be shown that failure tolimit such harvest would impact seriously on the migratory bird resource;and (5) tribal capabilities to establish and enforce migratory bird huntingregulations. No action is required if a tribe wishes to observe the huntingregulations that are established by the State(s) in which an Indian reservationis located. The guidelines have been used successfully since the 1985-86hunting season, and they are made final in this document, as was proposedin the July 22, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 27728). In the July 22, 1988 proposed rule, the Service pointed out that duck huntingregulations for the upcoming season likely would be more restrictive thanin the 1987-88 hunting season because of a reduced fall flight caused bydrought. Recently completed surveys on the breeding ground have confirmedthe expected decline. Although duck hunting regulations not have been establishedyet for the late season, they can be expected to be much more restrictivethan last year. <ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Issues Concerning Tribal Proposals </ITAG>Great Lakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission, Odanah, WisconsinIn an August 8, 1988, letter, C.D. Besadny, Secretary, Wisconsin Departmentof Natural Resources, commented on the proposed 1988-89 migratory birdhunting regulations for Chippewa Indians on ceded lands in the State. Amongother things, Mr. Besadny requested that the opening of the duck seasonbe delayed one week (from September 19 to September 26), that the Canadagoose season open on the same date as the duck season, and that the specialscaup-only season be cancelled. In the July 22, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 27728), the Service pointed out that thefall flight of ducks would be much lower than usual this year, and indicatedthat, for conservation purposes, duck harvest should be reduced. The GreatLakes Indian Fish and Wildlife Commission agreed with this request, andon August 9, 1988, notified the Service that a September 26 opening ofthe duck season was acceptable to the tribes. The delayed opening alsowill apply to coots and moorhen, and the special scaup-only season is suspended.The September 19 opening for Canada geese will proceed as proposed, withcertain safeguards in place at Wisconsin's Powell Marsh. As noted in the July 22, 1988 proposed rule, Michigan did not object tothe special regulations on ceded lands in the State. However, as was thecase last year, Minnesota continues to oppose special regulations for huntingby Chippewa Indians on ceded lands in the State. The Service recognizesMinnesota's concerns but for the reasons discussed in the July 22, 1988proposed rule, believes that continued carefully regulated seasons forChippewa Tribal members are appropriate in Minnesota, as well as in Michiganand Wisconsin. Therefore, special regulations for the 1988-89 hunting seasonare made final in this rule. The regulations take into account the needto reduce the harvest of ducks, and as in the past, the Great Lakes IndianFish and Wildlife Commission will conduct a survey to monitor the migratorybird harvest by tribal members. Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes, Flathead Indian Reservation, Pablo,Montana The Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes and the Montana Departmentof Fish, Wildlife and Parks are continuing the negotiations discussed inthe July 22, 1988 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 27728). The Service notes, however, thatthere is no disagreement over the waterfowl hunting regulations requestedby the tribes for the 1988-89 season, and they are made final in this rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Consideration </ITAG>The ``Final Environmental Statement for the Issuance of Annual RegulationsPermitting the Sport Hunting of Migratory Birds (FES-75-74)'' was filedwith the Council on Environmental Quality on June 6, 1975, and notice ofavailability was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 13, 1975 (40 FR 25241). A supplementto the final environmental statement ``Final Supplemental EnvironmentalImpact Statement: Issuance of Annual Regulations Permitting the Sport Huntingof Migratory Birds (SEIS) 88-14)'' was filed on June 9, 1988, and noticeof availability was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on June 16, 1988 (53 FR 22582) and June 17, 1988(53 FR 22727). In addition, an August 1985 environmental assessment entitled``Guidelines for Migratory Bird Hunting Regulations on Federal Indian Reservationsand Ceded Lands'' is available from the Service. <ITAG tagnum="84">Nontoxic Shot Regulations </ITAG>On December 14, 1987 (at 52 FR 47428), the Service proposed nontoxic shotzones for the 1988-89 waterfowl hunting season. This proposed rule wassent to all affected tribes and to Indian organizations for comment. Thefinal rule on nontoxic shot zones for the 1988-89 hunting season was publishedon June 28, 1988 in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 24284). All of the hunting regulationscovered by this final rule are in compliance with the Service's nontoxicshot restrictions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Endangered Species Act Consideration </ITAG>Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act provides that, ``The Secretaryshall review other programs administered by him and utilize such programsin furtherance of the purposes of this Act'' (and shall) ``insure thatany action authorized, funded or carried out * * * is not likely to jeopardizethe continued existence of any endangered species or threatened speciesor result in the destruction or adverse modification of [critical] habitat* * *.'' Consequently, the Service initiated section 7 consultation underthe Endangered Species Act for the proposed hunting season on Federal Indianreservations and ceded lands.  On August 8, 1988, the Division of Endangered Species and Habitat Conservationnotified the Office of Migratory Bird Management of its concurrence withthe finding that the proposed action will not affect any listed speciesor any critical habitat. <ITAG tagnum="85">Regulatory Flexibility Act, Executive Order 12291, and the PaperworkReduction Act </ITAG>In the March 9, 1988 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(53 FR 7702), the Service reported measures ithad undertaken to comply with requirements of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct and the Executive Order. These included preparing a Determination ofEffects and an updated Final Regulatory Impact Analysis, and publicationof a summary of the latter. These regulations have been determined to bemajor under Executive Order 12291, and they have a significant economicimpact on substantial numbers of small entities under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct. This determination is detailed in the aforementioned documents whichare available on request from the Office of Migratory Bird Management,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, Room 536, Matomic Building, Washington,DC 20240. These regulations contain no collection of information subjectto Office of Management and Budget review under the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980. <ITAG tagnum="84">Memorandum of Law </ITAG>The Service published its Memorandum of Law, required by section 4 of ExecutiveOrder 12291, in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>dated August 9, 1988 (53 FR 29897). <ITAG tagnum="84">Authorship </ITAG>The primary author of this final rule is Fant W. Martin, Office of MigratoryBird Management, working under the direction of Rollin D. Sparrowe, Chief.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulations Promulgation </ITAG>The rulemaking process for migratory bird hunting must, by its nature,operate under severe time constraints. However, the Service is of the viewthat every attempt should be made to give the public the greatest possibleopportunity to comment on the regulations. Thus, when the proposed huntingregulations for certain tribes were published on July 22, 1988, the Serviceestablished the longest period possible for public comments. In doing this,the Service recognized that time would be of the essence. The comment periodprovided the maximum amount of time possible while ensuring that a finalrule was published before the beginning of the hunting season on September1, 1988. Therefore, under the authority of the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July3, 1918, as amended (40 Stat. 755; 16 U.S.C. 703 <T3>et seq.</T3>), the Service prescribes final hunting regulations forcertain tribes on Federal Indian reservations (including off-reservationtrust lands), and ceded lands. The regulations specify the species to behunted and establish season dates, bag and possession limits, season length,and shooting hours for migratory game birds other than waterfowl. However,final Federal frameworks for the waterfowl hunting season (opening andclosing framework dates, daily bag and possession limits, etc.) are plannedfor publication on September 13, 1988. Because it was necessary to publishthis document by September 1, 1988 most waterfowl regulations for the tribeslisted here are shown as ``within final Federal frameworks to be established.''Therefore, for the reasons set out above, the Service finds that ``goodcause'' exists, within the terms of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) of the AdministrativeProcedure Act, and this final rule, therefore, will take effect on September1, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 20 </ITAG>Exports, Hunting, Imports, Transportation, Wildlife.
