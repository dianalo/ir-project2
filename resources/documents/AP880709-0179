Securities lawyers said such charges against a large U.S.industrial company are highly unusual and suggest the government istoughening and expanding its crackdown on Wall Street corruption.   At the same time, however, they said stock manipulation isalways difficult to prove and that federal prosecutors could face atime-consuming and possibly embarassing court fight with GAF, amajor producer of chemicals and building materials based in Wayne,N.J.   The 10-count indictment returned by a Manhattan federal grandjury last Wednesday against GAF, vice chairman James T. Sherwin andtwo subsidiaries alleges they manipulated Union Carbide Corp. stockin 1986 after a failed takeover attempt of the much larger chemicalcompany.   The object of the purported scheme was to induce other investorsto buy Carbide shares and thereby inflate the price, so GAF couldsell its 10 percent stake at a better profit or with minimal loss,the indictment alleges.   If convicted on all counts, GAF could face $15 million in fines,while Sherwin could face a 50-year prison term and $2.5 million infines. GAF and Sherwin have proclaimed innocence and vowed tocontest the charges.   It is the first indictment brought against an Americanindustrial concern stemming from evidence supplied indirectly byBoesky, a well-known stock speculator now serving a three-yearprison term for his central role in the biggest insider tradingcase in history.   The connection between Boesky and GAF is Boyd L. Jefferies,former head of a West Coast brokerage that bears his name. He wasimplicated by Boesky after the speculator agreed to cooperate withthe government's investigation.   Jefferies, who also has pleaded guilty to criminal charges andis cooperating with the government, is the main source ofinformation that led federal prosecutors to investigate GAF.   ``This appears to be part of the government's pattern of lookingat market practices of all kinds,'' said John F. Olson, asecurities attorney at the Washington law firm of Gibson, Dunn andamp;Crutcher and chairman of the American Bar Association's task forceon insider-trading regulation.   ``We're seeing more of that and more focus on it,'' he said.``This also shows that prosecutors are continuing to reap thebenefits of deals they made with Boesky and Jefferies.''   Nevertheless, securities lawyers said that in the GAF case, oneof the main legal challenges facing the government will be to provea conspiracy existed to influence the price of Carbide's stock.   Carbide is one of the largest publicly held companies and acomponent of the Dow Jones industrial average, with more than 127million common shares. On any given day, its stock price couldchange for a number of innocuous reasons, ranging from an analyst'searnings estimate to a stock-buyback rumor.   Some people familiar with the GAF indictment, who spoke oncondition they not be identified, said a second potential problemfacing the government is its possible use of Jefferies as awitness. Because Jefferies is an admitted felon, defense lawyerscould successfully destroy his credibility before a jury.   A third problem confronting prosecutors is whether the allegedmanipulation succeeded. The government claims Carbide shares rosein price as a result, although records show GAF didn't sell itsstake until several days later.   Several attorneys said they doubted prosecutors would havesought an indictment unless they had much more than evidencesupplied by Jefferies.   Others also noted that, unlike civil cases, rules concerningevidence in criminal matters are biased in the government's favor.The defendants may not know until trial what incriminating materialthe prosecutors will present.   ``I have to assume that if it's a criminal case, the governmentwill be ready to go to trial, and the judge will certainly push thecase to trial relatively quickly,'' said Gerald Walpin, a partnerat the New York law firm of Rosenman andamp; Colin and a former assistantU.S. attorney. ``I think certainly within six months we'll knowexactly what the government's case is.''   The GAF indictment wasn't the only development in the Boeskyscandal this past week. Speculation heightened that the Securitiesand Exchange Commission was about to file civil charges againstDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Wall Street investment firm thathas been under government investigation for months.   Another Boesky conspirator, inside trader Dennis B. Levine, wastransferred from prison to serve the remainder of his two-year termin a Manhattan halfway house. But in a setback for Levine, afederal judge ruled he must use his $12.8 million in illicitprofits to repay defrauded investors and not back taxes, whichtotal $12.2 million in federal claims alone.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
