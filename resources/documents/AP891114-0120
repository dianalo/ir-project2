Bush displayed a ``Solidarnosc'' bracelet he was wearing as agift from Polish labor leader Lech Walesa, to whom he gave thePresidential Medal of Freedom Monday night.   ``This concern with education is to be found wherever men andwomen seek to extend human liberty,'' said the president. He saidhe was ``deeply impressed by the changes that are underway inPoland and the fervent commitment of the Polish people to make thatchange permanent through education.''   Bush also made a pitch for parents to be given ``the power tochoose their children's schools,'' and for schools to be able tohire ``knowledgeable'' non-education majors as teachers.   American Education Week, Nov. 12-18 this year, has been observedannually since 1921. It is sponsored by the Department ofEducation, 10 national education groups and the American Legion.   Bush was joined on stage by representatives of each group andseveral local students, who presented him with a bronze statue ofchildren's hands holding the groups' ``Flag of Liberty andLearning.''   ``Look at that! Isn't that beautiful!'' Bush exclaimed as thethree-foot-high bronze was unveiled.   As Bush began to depart, Kevin Dauray, 9, a fourth-grader in awheelchair from Patrick Henry School in Alexandria, Va., piped up,``Can I have your autograph?''   The president quickly obliged the boy, penning his ``G. Bush''on one of the cards he had been reading from.</TEXT></DOC>
