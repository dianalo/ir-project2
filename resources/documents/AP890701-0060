The historical alliance between the conservative New DemocracyParty and the Coalition of Left and Progress comes 40 years afterthe communists were defeated in a civil war by U.S.-backedgovernment forces.   Leftist coalition head Harilaos Florakis emerged from a meetingtoday with New Democracy leader Constantine Mitsotakis to announcehe would support an interim government led by New Democracyparliamentarian Tzanis Tzannetakis.   Mitsotakis and Florakis conferred with President ChristosSartzetakis to detail the agreement that allows their coalition tohave a majority in the 300-member parliament and end eight years ofgovernment by the Panhellenic Socialist Movement of Premier AndreasPapandreou.   Besieged by a supportive crowd as he left the PresidentialPalace, Mitsotakis said the negotiations had ended positively andthat he had agreed on Tzannetakis as premier designate.   The president's office announced later that Tzannetakis would besworn in on Sunday.   Tzannetakis, 62, is popular among his colleagues in Parliamentand known for his fervent belief in democratic institutions.   Papandreou, tainted by financial scandals and a highly publicizedrelationship with a woman while he was married, had been asked bySartzetakis to remain as caretaker premier until the crisis wasresolved.   Parliament is scheduled to convene Monday and elect a housespeaker the next day. The new government goes before parliament intwo weeks to seek a vote of confidence.   Mitsotakis and Florakis agreed that the coalition would have athree-month life span and that its work would be limited torestoring democratic institutions and cleaning up Greek politics.   Florakis said that at the end of the three months, ``We willre-examine our position and act accordingly.''   However, one of the two parties could pull out of the coalitionbecause of wide differences in political ideology. If that happens,the president would then appoint another caretaker regime consistingof non-parliamentarians to lead the country to national elections.   The new coalition accord followed five days of meetings betweenleaders of the two groups.   The conservative-leftist coalition would resolve the politicalcrisis that followed general elections on June 18.   New Democracy won 145 seats, six short of a majority. It thusneeded to find a partner if it was to govern.   The Coalition of the Left and Progress captured 28 seats, whilethe larger Panhellenic Socialist Movement took 125 seats.   Two seats in this month's elections were also won by the smallconservative Democratic Renewal party and an independent.   Today's agreement came after attempts by leaders of all threemajor parties failed to form a coalition government.   The new parliament is to form a 12-member committee toinvestigate allegations that Papandreou and at least 20 other formerministers from his party and officials were involved inmultimillion-dollar financial scandals. Papandreou has denied anywrongdoing.   The conservative-leftist alliance is considered a major blow tothe socialists, who called on the communists to cooperate in agovernment of progressive forces. But Florakis turned them down,saying he would not join forces with a ``scandal-ridden'' group.   The coalition talks were the first time in the history of Greece,a nation of 10 million, that the communists had been given theopportunity to help form a government.</TEXT></DOC>
