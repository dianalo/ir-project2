Bork expressed doubts that he would keep the promise.   In a pledge similar to that made by Bork in his tumultuousconfirmation hearing, nominee Bernard Siegan said he would``observe the law of the land'' and added, ``I would resign'' ifunable to do so.   Siegan, a 63-year-old professor at the University of San DiegoLaw School, is President Reagan's nominee for the 9th U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals.   The circuit, on which new Supreme Court justice Anthony M.Kennedy served, has jurisdiction over Alaska, Arizona, California,Hawaii, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Washington, Guam and theNorthern Mariana Islands.   Siegan told the Senate Judiciary Committee, ``There are times Iwill rule contrary to my own feelings. It would be a directviolation and contrary of my oath to push my position ahead of theSupreme Court.''   In his confirmation hearings last year, Bork was unable toconvince senators he would put aside his controversial writings,and he suffered a crushing defeat in the Senate by a 58-42 vote.   Siegan's free-wheeling views do not always parallel those ofBork, but he's just as controversial when writing on subjects suchas civil rights, economic law, separation of church and state, andequal protection for women.   As the hearing ended, People for the American Way, which hadopposed Bork vigorously, attacked Siegan in a statement.   ``Bernard Siegan spent the morning distancing himself from hisentire body of legal scholarship,'' the group said. But Sen. OrrinG. Hatch, R-Utah, who was one of Bork's main supporters, toldSiegan, ``I hope people will give you a fair shake.''   Siegan's testimony did not convince to Bork opponents: Sens.Howard M. Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, and Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt.   Leahy questioned Siegan's almost total lack of experience infederal courtrooms. ``The last time you were in federal court (35years ago) I was 12 years old.''   Metzenbaum told Siegan, ``I'm concerned that if confirmed, youwill find a way to implement your views. Circuit courts are oftenthe courts of last resort.'' He said there would be a ``greatrisk'' if the Senate confirmed Siegan.   Responding to Leahy, Siegan said, ``A circuit court judge isgiven scholarly duties to see if what the lower court did wasright. I have spent 20 years of my life in scholarly activities.Even a lawyer with trial experience may not know how to write anopinion.''   Among Siegan's controversial writings:   He would have outlawed separate but equal schools as the SupremeCourt did in 1954, but would have used a reasoning far afield fromthat used by the high court in reaching its decision.   According to Siegan, the court should have based its decision onthe right of black students to travel to the school of theirchoice. Civil rights advocates have said travel to a new schoolwould not guarantee pupils a seat inside.   Siegan wrote that the 14th Amendment ``safeguards onlyfundamental and natural rights from violation by the states. Thereis no fundamental or natural right to education, nor to anintegrated education. Each is a political right created bygovernment and is accordingly not within the guarantees of the 14thAmendment.''   He wrote that the amendment, which extended federalconstitutional safeguards to residents of the individual states,was meant to safeguard religious liberty _ but not separation ofchurch and state.   It is that view which led him to say it is ``possible to arguethat prayer in school would not be in violation of theConstitution.'' The Supreme Court has taken the opposite view.</TEXT></DOC>
