William Niskanen, a former member of Reagan's Council ofEconomic Advisers, said that time after time the administration hasbowed to industry pressure to block imports.   In one industry alone, autos, Niskanen estimated that theadministration's policies ended up costing American consumers $1.1billion annually in higher car costs. He said that worked out to$240,000 for each job saved in the domestic auto industry.   ``The consistent goal of the president was free trade, both inthe United States and abroad,'' Niskanen writes in a new book. ``Inresponse to domestic political pressure, however, theadministration has imposed more new restraints on trade than anyadministration since Hoover.''   Niskanen's book, entitled ``Reaganomics: An Insider's Account ofthe Policies and the People,'' is the latest published work byformer top administration officials depicting behind-the-scenesWhite House struggles over policy.   Like former budget director David Stockman and former WhiteHouse chief of staff and Treasury Secretary Donald T. Regan,Niskanen paints a picture of a remote president who rarelyunderstood the intricacies of the subjects being heatedly debatedby his advisers.   ``At Cabinet meetings he was visibly uncomfortable on beingpresented with a complex argument,'' Niskanen writes. ``He wasimpatient to hear conclusions.''   In a criticism that could be leveled about the currentpresidential campaign, Niskanen said that candidate Reagan in 1980and 1984 resisted telling voters the hard choices that would beneeded to reduce the federal budget deficit.   ``At no time during the 1980 and 1984 campaigns did Reaganacknowledge that a substantial reduction in domestic programs wasnecessary to permit both a defense buildup and a tax rate cutwithout an increase in the deficit,'' he said.   Likewise in the trade area, Niskanen said that Reagan foundhimself constrained by promises he made on the campaign trail, inparticular a pledge to Chrysler workers in the fall of 1980 that``one way or another'' Japanese car imports to the United Stateswould be reduced.   The way found by the administration was to pressure the Japaneseto put into place voluntary constraints on car imports. Theadministration kept up pressure on the Japanese to maintain theimport quotas even after the auto industry was enjoying recordprofits and bestowing huge bonuses on its executives because it wasin the midst of the 1984 presidential campaign, Niskanen said.   Politics also played a part in an administration decision inOctober 1986 that imported softwood lumber from Canada was beingunfairly subsidized by the Canadian government. Niskanen said that``determination was clearly timed to save several Republican Senateseats in the timber-producing states.''   Trade is an issue in the 1988 campaign as well with Democratshoping to get political mileage out of Reagan's veto last Tuesdayof a trade bill which contained a labor-backed proposal requiringadvance notification of plant closings and layoffs.   While sharply criticizing Congress for protectionist bills,Reagan has granted import relief to such industries as autos,steel, machine tools, textiles and apparel, Niskanen said.   ``A cynic might conclude that the administration wanted tomaintain control of the distribution of protectionist favors andopposed only those trade constraints proposed by Congress,''Niskanen said.   A former chief economist at Ford Motor Co., Niskanen joined thethree-member Council of Economic Advisers in 1981 as a conservativecommitted to Reagan's agenda of trimming back the federalgovernment. Niskanen left the administration in 1985 and is nowchairman of the Cato Institute, a conservative Washington thinktank.   Niskanen gives Reagan credit for delivering at least partiallyon his campaign promises to lower the growth of governmentspending, reduce tax rates and lower inflation. But he concludesthat there ``was no Reagan revolution.''   He blamed the failure of Reagan to make more substantialprogress in reducing the growth of government on the fact that ``ascandidate and president, Reagan endorsed the major survivingprograms of the New Deal.''   ``The primary reason why Reaganomics did not prove to be arevolution is that there has not yet been a fundamental change inthe perception about what the federal government should and shouldnot do,'' Niskanen said.   Niskanen said the next president should strive to get spendingcuts in the programs which grew most rapidly during the Reaganyears, agriculture, defense and medical care.   He said that increased taxes would be needed as well, but thatthe hikes should not come from raising tax rates but rather bygoing further in eliminating tax deductions, a trend which wasstarted by the 1986 tax overhaul legislation.   Niskanen said there was no valid reason for maintainingdeductions for state and local income taxes and property taxes. Healso proposed taxing fringe benefits employees receive and reducingthe personal exemption to $300 instead of $2,000.</TEXT></DOC>
