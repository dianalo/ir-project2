(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>HP, Silicon Graphics Escalate 3-D Graphics Workstation WarandM;The struggle for dominance of the graphics workstation market has moved intothe midrange, where top contenders Hewlett-Packard and Silicon Graphics havepositioned their latest products.andM;HP last week announced a new pair of 3-D graphics workstations priced from$35,000 to $38,000.andP;  According to HP officials, these are the lowest-priced3-D workstations ever offered by the company.andM;Initial assessments of the new HP offerings indicate that the company haswalloped its biggest competitor and graphics workstation market leader,Silicon Graphics, at its weakest point.andM;However, Mountain View, Calif.-based Silicon Graphics will bolster itsneglected midrange product line this week by introducing a redesigned systemat a 28 percent price reduction.andM;Meanwhile, DEC is planning to enter the midrange graphics workstation fraysoon with the introduction of a 3-D DECstation.andM;At present, Silicon Graphics dominates the market for graphics workstationsby a wide margin, said Bob Herwick, a New York-based analyst for investmentbanking company Hambrecht andamp; Quist of San Francisco.andP;  HP, which ranks secondin this market, sold only one-half to one-third as many graphics systems asSilicon Graphics did last year, Herwick said.andM;As the largest vendor in the specialized graphics field, Silicon Graphics hasshifted the bulk of its development resources to the high end, where itcompetes primarily with Stardent, and to the low end, where it is attemptingto increase the overall market for graphics workstations, Herwick said.andM;As a result of Silicon Graphics' divided development efforts, the company'sGT Series of midrange products had become relatively lackluster, according toHerwick.andP;  This left a temporary window of vulnerability in the SiliconGraphics product line for exploitation by HP, DEC and others, he said.andM;Silicon Graphics is likely to have effectively closed that window with thisweek's introduction of a 13-MIPS 4D/85GT, which is available now and pricedat $49,900 in a base configuration, company officials said.andM;The midrange 4D/85G is virtually the same as its $70,000 predecessor, the4D/80GT, except for an expanded VME backplane, the addition of removable tapeand disk drives, and an available pixel bus slot.andP;  The 4D/85GT features sixVME slots, compared with only four in the 4D/80GT.andP;  One of the six VME slotson the 4D/85GT is a pixel bus slot that can be used to install an optionallive digitizer board.andP;  Previously, digitizer boards were available only onSilicon Graphics' high-end Power Series systems, according to a SiliconGraphics spokeswoman.andM;Paul Koontz, Silicon Graphics' product line manager for graphics products,said the 4D/85GT is roughly comparable in cost to the new HP systems, whoselower entry prices do not include disk drives or additional graphics bitplanes that come with standard Silicon Graphics systems.andM;The Hewlett-Packard introduction last week consisted of the HP 9000 Series800 Model 834SRX and the 834 TurboSRX, both of which are rated by HPofficials as capable of performing 14 MIPS.andP;  The machines are priced at$35,000 and $38,000, respectively, and will be available next month,according to an HP spokesman.andM;Herwick said he expects the forthcoming DEC 3-D workstation to target thesame $30,000 to $50,000 price range occupied by HP and Silicon Graphicsmidrange systems.andM;DEC has not formally announced the machine, but sources said it will be basedon a 25MHz R3000 microprocessor from Mips Computer Systems and willincorporate an Intel i860 chip as a co-processor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
