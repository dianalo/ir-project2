In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Cincinnati-based Surgical Appliance said the transaction could be carried out through a &quot;friendly merger&quot; of Lumex and a company owned jointly by Surgical Appliance and by Lumex's management.    However, Lumex's president, Lawrence N. Cohen, said Friday that the company &quot;absolutely is not for sale.&quot; He said it is in the best interest of its shareholders for Lumex to &quot;remain independent and proceed on its present plans.&quot; Lumex last month adopted a so-called poison pill plan to deter hostile takeovers.    Lumex, based in Bay Shore, N.Y., makes health care products. Surgical Appliance makes and distributes surgical and medical products.    According to the SEC filing, Surgical Appliance holds 9.3% of Lumex's common outstanding, including 7,900 shares purchased from April 20 to April 25 for $11 each. Surgical Appliance disclosed in February that it had accumulated a 5.1% stake in Lumex; in March it said it raised its stake to 9.1%. </TEXT></DOC>
