SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two of every five American women giving birthto their first children weren't married when they became pregnant,the Census Bureau said Wednesday, a rise over the past two decades.   The bureau also found a jump in the birth rate among women intheir 30s, noted that a majority of the women having a baby in theyear ending in June 1988 were in the work force, and said minoritiestend to have higher birth rates.   In all, the bureau said the national fertility rate was 69.7births per 1,000 women aged 18 to 44 in that year. Those areconsidered the prime childbearing ages.   Fertility rates have remained at about 70 births per 1,000 womenduring this decade and the figure for 1988 is not consideredsignificantly different from the 71 recorded the year before.   But changes have occurred among the women becoming mothers inAmerica.   For women aged 15 to 29, the bureau found, 40 percent of theirfirst-born children from 1985 to 1988 were conceived out ofmarriage, up from just over 30 percent when the measure was firsttaken from 1970 to 1974.   The 40 percent of new mothers who conceived out of wedlockincluded 11.7 percent who got married before the child was born and28.3 percent who were still unmarried when the baby arrived.   The major change was among that second group, the women who werestill unmarried when the baby arrived. They increased from 17.9percent of all first-time mothers in the early 1970s to the 28.3percent recorded in 1985 to 1988.   This shift ``may reflect the opinion of some women that they maybe better off in the long run by relying more on the support oftheir parents and relatives for financial and emotional assistancethan by entering a potentially unstable marriage undertaken solelyto prevent an out-of-wedlock birth,'' bureau analyst Amara Bachusaid in the report.   At the same time that the share of unwed-mothers was rising, thepercentage of women conceiving while single and then getting marriedbefore the arrival of the baby dropped from 14.9 percent to 11.7percent of first mothers.   The share of unwed first mothers varied sharply by race, thestudy also found.   Among black women 74.6 percent of first births to women aged 15to 29 occurred out of wedlock from 1985 to 1988, up from 54.1percent for 1970 to 1974.   For Hispanic women, the rate was 30.6 percent, up from 26.7percent earlier. And white women had 19.6 percent out-of-wedlockbirths, up from 11.5 percent.   The new report also confirmed the widely reported trend of womenpostponing births as they pursue education and careers.   The ``increases in childbearing among women over 30 ... suggestthat childless women now more than in the past are deliberatelypostponing their childbearing to older ages,'' the report said.   For women aged 30 to 34, the 1988 fertility rate was 81.6 birthsper 1,000 women, up from 60 in 1980 and 56.4 in 1976. A similar,though smaller, increase was reported for women 35 to 39.   The bureau also asked women about their plans for families andnoted that, among childless wives aged 25 to 29, 85 percent stillexpect to have a child at some point. That's up from 75 percent whoexpected a future birth in this age group in 1975.   Still, the study concluded, ``the question remains: How strong isthe commitment to childbearing after remaining married and childlessfor several years?''   For women aged 18 to 44, the study reported that 50.9 percent ofwomen giving birth in 1988 were in the work force, up from 50.8percent a year earlier and just 38 percent in 1980.   ``Labor force participation among women with newborn children isappreciably higher for college-educated women that for women'' withless education, the report found.   Among new mothers with college degrees nearly 60 percent were inthe labor force, compared with 49 percent of high school grads and34 percent who had not finished high school.   By race, 59 percent of black mothers were in the labor force,compared with 50 percent of whites and 37 percent among Hispanics.</TEXT></DOC>
