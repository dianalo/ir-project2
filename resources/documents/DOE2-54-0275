<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-54-0275 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Takahashi-Umezawa method of deriving the free covariant quantizationrelations from the linear equations of motion is extended to superfields.The Cauchy problem for free superfields is solved, and an expressionfor the time independent scalar product is given. For the case of interactingfields, we give the general Kaellen-Lehmann spectral representation forthe two-point superfield Green functions and, after the introductionof the asymptotic condition for superfields, we give the superfield extensionof the Yang-Feldman equation. The case of the D = 2 real scalar superfieldand the case of the D = 4 chiral superfield are discussed in detail.</TEXT></DOC>
