Fighting along the frontier appeared to subside yesterday, with Honduran troops, ferried by U.S. military helicopter crews, reestablishing control.    While the two nations offered different versions of what happened at the border, they agreeed that neither wants war despite the vast gap that separates their interests and ideologies. Here in the Honduran capital, Nicaraguan Ambassador Danilo Abud Vivas said he was communicating with the Honduran Foreign Ministry personally and by telephone to keep a lid on the crisis. &quot;They are saying we must deal with this problem with prudence and care,&quot; the ambassador said. &quot;We prefer to think Honduras doesn't want war.&quot;    On the Honduran side, Roberto Flores Bermudez, director-general of the Honduran Foreign Ministry, said: &quot;This doesn't mean war because the Honduran reaction has been limited and proportional in order to preserve our integrity and sovereignty.&quot;    Honduras has said it won't engage in formal talks with Nicaragua's Sandinista regime as long as Nicaragua accuses it in the World Court of harboring between 7,000 and 15,000 of the anti-Sandinista Contras. But a senior Honduran official confirmed that &quot;channels are open&quot; between Tegucigalpa and Managua because of the clash.    While the two governments directly involved seemed to be trying to play down the weekend incident, in Washington, Contra leaders and U.S. Contra sympathizers were saying the fighting proves the Sandinistas are a regional threat. They apparently hoped the battle would put an end to the series of damaging blows the Contras have suffered, beginning with disclosures they benefited from U.S. arms sales to Iran and running through last week's decision by Honduran leaders to ask Washington to force the U.S.-supported Contras out of Honduras in the next few months.    Despite the weekend fighting, there were signs that relations between the two neighbors might improve. The Nicaraguan ambassador said Honduran pressure on Washington to push the Contras, who operate out of bases here, to quit Honduras and fight inside Nicaragua &quot;will help our relations. That's our only problem -- that Honduras is a trampoline for U.S. (Contra) policy.&quot;    (Administration officials said in Washington there is an informal understanding with Honduras that the U.S. will encourage the Contras to move into Nicaragua. Yesterday, however, White House spokesman Larry Speakes denied that there is a firm &quot;pact between the U.S. and Honduras&quot; calling for the removal of the Contras.)    On the Honduran side, officials and many ordinary people are ecstatic that their air force attacked Sandinista troops, who have held positions inside the frontier most of this year. Honduran army officers have been embarrassed that Contra and Sandinista forces have been fighting on Honduran soil. Honduran officials are claiming victory in the weekend clash, but privately so as not to offend Nicaragua.    According to the Honduran version of the battle, Sandinista army units last week attacked a Honduran army outpost and three hamlets. At least three Honduran troops were wounded and two captured. In response, Honduran air force A-37 Dragonfly jets bombed Sandinista army positions inside Honduras Saturday and Sunday.    Nicaraguan Ambassador Abud Vivas, however, contended that the jets, piloted by either Hondurans or Americans, took off from Honduras and dropped bombs in Nueva Segovia and Jinotega provinces inside Nicaragua, leaving seven Sandinista troops dead and 12 wounded. He said two children, ages four and 11, were wounded in the town of Wiwili nearly 15 miles south of the border. The Sandinistas claim Honduras dropped bombs on their army's border positions to permit Contra guerrillas to infiltrate from Honduras into Nicaragua.    The military confrontation between the two nations was the most serious since September 1985. At that time, following several days of Nicaraguan cross-border mortaring, the Honduran air force bombed two Sandinista mortar positions inside Nicaragua and shot down a Soviet-supplied Mi-8 helicopter over Nicaraguan air space. In March, U.S. helicopter crews flew Honduran troops to the border region to drive a Sandinista force, seeking to destroy Contra camps, back into Nicaragua. But the two armies didn't fight each other then.    Defense Department officials in Washington said that the U.S. helicopter lift of Honduran troops ended late yesterday. They said Sandinista attacks increased at the border when it became clear that the Washington crisis over shipments of arms to Iran was eroding Contra support in the U.S.    &quot;The best friend the Contras have is Daniel Ortega,&quot; says Penn Kimble, a Contra supporter who is a Democratic defense adviser. Mr. Ortega is president of Nicaragua.    Mario Claro, a representative of the Contras in Washington, claimed it was mainly Contra resistance, not Honduran military action that was forcing the Sandinista troops out of Honduran territory. He also said that the clash demonstrates that Nicaragua is a regional threat.    &quot;What was in Ortega's mind? He's showing the world that he can tweak Uncle Sam's nose,&quot; Mr. Claro said.    ---   Also contributing to this article was Tim Carrington in Washington. </TEXT></DOC>
