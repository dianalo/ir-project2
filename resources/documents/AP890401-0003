North'sdefense that he carried out administration orders by covering uphis work for the Nicaraguan Contras was crippled when a federaljudge refused to compel former President Reagan to testify.   In denying a request to call Reagan as a defense witness inNorth's trial, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell said Friday hecouldn't find any evidence that the former president authorizedNorth's activities.   ``The trial record presently contains no proof that defendantNorth ever received any authorization from President Reagan toengage in the illegal conduct alleged, either directly orindirectly, orally or in writing,'' Gesell wrote in a five-pageorder.   ``Nothing there even remotely supports an authorization claim,''Gesell said.   Reagan, in Los Angeles where he now lives, said Friday he hadbeen determined to fight any attempts to force him to testify.   ``I made up my mind I wasn't going,'' Reagan told KESQ-TV. ``Ithink it would have set a precedent that the next president doesn'thave a right to impose on other presidents. No president has everbeen subpoenaed.''   Reagan would have been the first former president to becompelled to testify in a criminal proceeding concerning hisconduct while in office had Gesell agreed to make him appear.   The defense is scheduled to begin presenting its case Monday,the seventh week of North's trial. Defense attorney Barry Simonrefused to identify the first witness.   The prosecution had put on 29 witnesses, and on Friday the judgedenied a defense motion to dismiss remaining counts against North.   The defense argues that North was simply following Reagan'sorders when he lied to Congress in 1985 and 1986 about the NationalSecurity Council's involvement in helping the Nicaraguan Contras.   North's attorneys had subpoenaed Reagan so they could ask himwhat he knew about the NSC's role in raising money for the Contrasat a time Congress had barred U.S. military assistance to therebels.   The 12-count indictment against North accuses him of obstructingCongress and making false statements in connection with letters hedrafted and a meeting with House intelligence committee members.   The judge said he reached his decision about Reagan's testimonyafter studying the trial record, thousands of pages of classifiedand unclassified documents, portions of Reagan's personal diariesand written answers Reagan provided to the grand jury.   Gesell said no presidential privilege prevented him fromordering the former president to testify, but the defense failed toprove Reagan's testimony was crucial to provide North a fair trial.   Theodore B. Olson, Reagan's personal attorney, said he waspleased with the order. Simon declined comment.   The Justice Department had opposed Reagan's court appearance onthe grounds it could have opened the door for questioning aboutsensitive national security matters.   Gesell acknowledged there is ``understandable public interest''in what Reagan ``may have known or may have done.'' But he saidNorth's trial does not involve such a broad inquiry.   He noted that three conspiracy charges against North involvingpresidential matters had been dropped.   North also is accused of illegally accepting a $13,800 securitysystem at his home from co-defendant Richard Secord, converting tohis own use at least $4,300 in travelers checks from Contra leaderAdolfo Calero and conspiring to defraud the Treasury of tax revenuein connection with charitable contributions supporting the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
