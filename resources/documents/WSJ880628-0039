Freedman (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> FOD MKT </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Nestle S.A. unveiled two new infant-formula products, its first big move into the U.S. market, and a multimillion dollar marketing campaign that breaks with industry tradition by advertising to mothers as well as physicians.    The new products, which will be sold by Nestle's Los Angeles-based Carnation unit, pose a tricky marketing challenge. In the late 1970s, controversy about Nestle's infant-formula marketing practices led to a world-wide boycott of all its products. Some physicians are already raising objections to Nestle's U.S. plans.    Some analysts, however, think the Swiss company is proceeding too cautiously to get a foothold in the $1.6 billion U.S. infant-formula market, which is dominated by pharmaceutical giants Abbott Laboratories Inc. and Bristol-Myers Co.    At a news conference in New York yesterday, Carnation executives and a team of doctors proclaimed one of the new products, Good Start H.A., as a &quot;medical breakthrough.&quot; The whey-based product is designed for infants who are allergic to standard milk-based and soy-based formulas. The company estimates that allergy to protein in formula occurs in as many as 15% to 20% of infants.    Good Nature, Carnation's second formula product, is designed for older babies who have begun to eat solid foods.    Carnation said it will support its new products with a multimillion-dollar campaign that will explain the symptoms of intolerance to standard formula and urge consumers to consult their pediatricians. Some analysts criticized the company for using scare tactics based on inconclusive research. But the campaign, which is expected to appear in the fall in publications read by new mothers, won't name the Good Start brand or refer to the product.    &quot;We don't want in any way for our promotional efforts to glamorize formula feeding or provide a disincentive for breast feeding,&quot; said Ernie Strapazon, assistant general manager of Carnation's newly formed nutritional products division. He described Nestle's marketing of infant formula as &quot;very responsible.&quot;    In the late 70s and early 80s, Nestle came under heavy fire from health professionals who charged the company was encouraging mothers in Third World countries to give up breast feeding and use formula, which mothers sometimes unwittingly prepared with contaminated water.    A boycott of Nestle products ended in 1984, when its organizers said the company was in compliance with infant formula marketing codes adopted by the World Health Organization, which call on governments to prohibit advertising that would discourage breast feeding.    Good Nature, the supplement product designed for babies over four months, will be advertised by name directly to consumers. But Carnation's Mr. Strapazon said such advertising will always portray older babies, solid food and training cups&quot; -- not baby bottles and nipples.&quot;    The planned marketing approach has already raised some objections in the medical community. In a June 24 letter to Timm Crull, Carnation's president, Dr. Richard Narkewicz, president of the American Academy of Pediatrics, wrote that any attempt to dissuade mothers from breast feeding by advertising &quot;would be strongly condemned by the academy.&quot; He urged Carnation to &quot;reconsider&quot; its plans.    In the infant formula market, Abbott Laboratories has a 48% share; Bristol-Myers, a 35% share; and American Home Products Corp., 10%.    The big question is whether Nestle's pitch to consumers will actually translate into sales. Although speculation about Nestle's impending move into infant nutrition sent stock prices of Bristol-Myers and Abbott skidding earlier this month, many analysts said the product announcements won't pose a major threat to Nestle's well-entrenched competition.    Shares of Bristol-Myers closed yesterday at $39.75, up 12.5 cents; Abbott closed at $44.875, up 37.5 cents; and American Home Products fell $1.375 to $74.25.    Larry Feinberg, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., said he was &quot;amazed&quot; by Carnation's &quot;conservative marketing posture.&quot; For example, the company doesn't intend to give free Good Start samples to mothers in the hospital. He also criticized the plan not to use the Good Start name in advertising. &quot;We were expecting a major consumer advertising campaign and a substantial give-away program in hospitals to really establish the product, but the company seems to be shying away from both,&quot; he said.    Moreover, some expect Nestle -- which doesn't hold patents on either product -- will get overtaken by more aggressive rivals. Abbott is rumored to be readying a product that will directly rival Good Start; it declined to comment. Bristol-Myers, which has long had a similar product on the market called Nutramigen, said &quot;We don't view this market entry as alarming.&quot;    There is also considerable disagreement over the potential market for Good Start. The Pediatric Academy's committee on nutrition says only 1% to 2% of babies have an intolerance to milk.    &quot;Compared to what people were thinking before the press conference, this was a non-event,&quot; Frederick Greenberg, a drug analyst at Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., said. </TEXT></DOC>
