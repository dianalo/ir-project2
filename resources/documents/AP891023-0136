Baker III calledMonday for a new military relationship with the Soviet Union tosharply reduce the ``first strike'' nuclear weapons that could bedevastating in a surprise attack.   Baker, in his first major arms-control speech, also urged areluctant Congress to approve White House requests for funds toproduce mobile Midgetman missiles. Otherwise, he said, the Sovietscould exploit differences between Capitol Hill and the Bushadministration.   ``United we stand; divided we fall,'' Baker said in a speech tothe private Commonwealth Club of San Francisco.

Baker's emphasis on reducing U.S. and Soviet first-strikeweapons, such as Soviet SS-18 intercontinental ballisic missiles,signals the strategy the United States will pursue in trying toconclude a treaty with the Soviet Union in Geneva.   There, U.S. and Soviet negotiators began work in the Reaganadministration to cut arsenals of strategic weapons _ocean-spanning bombers, missiles and submarines _ by 30 percent to50 percent. Critics, such as former Secretary of State Henry A.Kissinger, have urged the United States to put greater stress onslashing first-strike weapons instead of concentrating onacross-the-board numerical reductions.   Baker made no reference to a 30 percent to 50 percent cutback inhis speech. This did not suggest the Bush administration wouldabandon that goal in the Strategic Arms Reduction Talks (START),but his emphasis on curbing first-strike weapons indicated a moreselective approach in negotiating reductions.   Like the SS-18, designed to destroy U.S. intercontinentalballistic missiles in their silos, first-strike nuclear weaponshave the potential of wreaking havoc on the other side's nuclearforces.   President Reagan responded to the perceived threat by launchinga program, known popularly as ``Star Wars,'' designed to destroySoviet ballistic missiles in space before they could approach theirtargets.   Baker, in his speech, encouraged the Soviets to concentratetheir efforts on defense, as well, while the Bush administrationpursues the Strategic Defense Initiative.   He said in the Geneva negotiations the United States wouldexplore ``a cooperative and stable transition to a greater relianceon stability-enhancing, cost-effective strategic defense.''   In fact, Baker said, ``we want to see Soviet defensive militaryoperations made habitual.''   He said the Bush administration was emphasing in negotiationsthe relative merits of slow-flying weapons, such as cruise missilesand bombers, which are not suitable for a first strike.   Baker said the U.S. goal was ``a new relationship in which thecapabilities and incentives to attack first are minimized and thepossibilities of strategic defense are pursued.''   Meanwhile, Baker used the speech to publicly prod Congress todrop its objections to the Midgetman, which is designed as asafeguard against a Soviet first-strike because of its mobility.   The House has eliminated the $100 million requested by the WhiteHouse but the Senate gave its approval for the money. A conferencecommittee is trying to resolve this and other differences over the$305 billion defense authorization bill.   ``We will need to rely upon the deployment of mobile missiles asa key component of our nuclear modernization program,'' Baker said.   Referring to the negotiations in Geneva, Baker added, ``Congressneeds now to support START, not undercut it, by funding thisprogram.''   Baker initially planned to speak to the Commonwealth Club onarms control last Thursday. The earthquake caused the postponement.   Answering questions later on other subjects, Baker reaffirmedU.S. support for the reunification of East and West Germany in away in which East Germans ``will be integrated into a community ofdemocratic European nations.''   He acknowledged, however, that the idea of joining the twoGermanies together ``conjures up visions of a return to 1937borders or perhaps a reunification that is not achieved in peaceand freedom.''   On another subject, Baker said that despite a sustained effortto arrange Arab-Israeli negotiations, ``I don't see it as anythingmore than a possibility.''</TEXT></DOC>
