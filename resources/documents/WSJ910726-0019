Raychem, a telecommunications, electronics and aerospaceconcern, had projected an unspecified loss for the period,but the loss was about twice as bad as some analystsexpected. It underscored the risk Raychem is taking as itpours hundreds of millions of dollars into a race against bigcompetitors to develop the basic products for deliveringadvanced video, voice and information services into the home.</LP><TEXT>   In the year-earlier period, Raychem had a net loss of$13.6 million, or 38 cents a share. Sales for the periodedged up to $317.9 million from $295 million.   For the full fiscal year, the company had a loss of $23.4million, or 63 cents, compared with a year-ago loss of $111.4million, or $3.12 a share, including a $90 millionrestructuring charge. Sales for the year rose to $1.2 billionfrom $1.1 billion, but Raychem said the latest year's saleswould have been $70 million lower had currency exchange ratesstayed the same as they were last year.   Raychem stock fell 25 cents on the news to $27 incomposite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   Robert J. Saldich, chief executive officer, said thecompany was hurt by recessionary pressures, particularly indomestic markets, and by continuing losses at its RaynetCorp. subsidiary. That's the unit which is trying to developfiber-optic technology at the heart of Raychem's gamble onhome-delivery of video and other electronic information. Forthe fiscal year, Raynet had a pretax loss of $73.8 million,up from $64.4 million a year earlier.   Analysts expect Raychem to have invested more than $300million in developing the new fiber-optic technology by theend of next year. Raychem is betting its products will becomethe basic equipment for so-called local-loops operated bytelephone companies.   While analysts believe the market for such products couldeventually be huge, Raychem is racing against deep-pocketed,heavyweight global competitors, including several Japanesecompanies. If Raychem doesn't win that race, analysts believethe company could be stuck in its slow-growing core defenseand electronics businesses for years to come.</TEXT></DOC>
