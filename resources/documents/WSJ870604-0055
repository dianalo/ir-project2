BirnbaumStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 06/04/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> TAXES GOVMTECONOMIC NEWS (ECO)CONGRESS (CNG)DEFENSE DEPARTMENT (DEF) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Congressional Democrats neared agreement on a budget compromise that would tie an increase in military spending to a tax increase of about $19.5 billion for fiscal 1988.    The proposal, endorsed by the Democratic leadership in both chambers, would shrink the projected budget deficit by slightly more than $36 billion in the year that begins Oct. 1, or somewhat more than in President Reagan's budget plan. But the proposal is likely to rile Mr. Reagan, who opposes such a large tax increase and also wants military spending to grow more than in the Democrats' plan.    The Democrats, who control both the House and the Senate, have been haggling for weeks over a compromise. The two chambers have passed differing versions of the budget package, with the House plan containing less military spending than the more conservative Senate's plan.    The compromise proposal moves toward the Senate figure on defense, but also adopts many of the higher domestic-spending initiatives contained in the House bill. These provisions would be covered by tax increases that are larger than the roughly $18 billion of increases in the House-passed and Senate-passed plans. Additional revenue also would be derived from the refinancing of loans to the Rural Electrification Administration.    Yesterday, the chairmen of the Budget Committees and other party leaders worked to sell the compromise as the final plan that will dictate tax and spending legislation for the remainder of the year. Some resistance was voiced, however, and discussions on final details are expected to continue.    Still, the general direction of the proposal is likely to hold, putting Congress and the president on a collision course, particularly over taxes. House Majority Leader Thomas Foley of Washington yesterday told reporters that the House will vote for a tax increase, even though the lawmakers know that one won't become law without the president's concurrence. He and other Democratic leaders believe that a &quot;responsible&quot; deficit-reduction package must contain a tax increase, Mr. Reagan's opposition notwithstanding.    The compromise calls for military-spending authority of $298 billion in fiscal 1988, with outlays that year of $289 billion. This would permit a $9.4 billion increase in projected outlays from this year -- nearly enough to keep pace with inflation.    The Senate's plan called for military budget authority of $301.5 billion and outlays of $290.6 billion. The House's number was $288.7 billion in budget authority and outlays of $281.7 billion.    The Democrats hope to gain President Reagan's cooperation with their budget plan by adopting a Senate-devised strategem. Under the proposal, if the president fails to sign tax-increase legislation, military outlays would be about $7 billion lower than the figure in the compromise document.    Specifically, the Democrats are planning to bundle the $19.5 billion of tax increases into the same piece of legislation allocating the $7 billion necessary to reach the compromise figure for military outlays. Democratic strategists argue that the president might think twice about vetoing a tax increase if extra military spending also is at stake.    The budget plan doesn't dictate which types of taxes would be increased. Congressional tax-writing committees would make those choices in an effort to raise the amount of revenue specified in the congressional budget resolution.    The compromise would adopt many of the House-passed bill's spending increases for domestic programs. Extra spending for research on AIDS, or acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and aid to the homeless would be part of the plan.    To help pay for these programs, as well as for the higher military spending, additional revenue of about $7 billion would be collected in fiscal 1988 by refinancing loans to the Rural Electrification Administration. This was a proposal in the Senate-passed bill, but opposed by several House members, including Speaker James Wright (D., Texas).    The budget resolution will require approval by a House-Senate conference committee, followed by approval from both houses of Congress. The resolution doesn't need the president's signature. </TEXT></DOC>
