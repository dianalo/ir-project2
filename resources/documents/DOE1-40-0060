<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-40-0060 </DOCNO><TEXT>Since the Three Mile Island Unit 2 accident occurred, numerous issueshave been addressed in regards to the B and W 2 x 4 loop NSSS designs.In particular, some concern has been raised relevant to the B and W NSSSslargely because of some unique components and hardware features in theplant design in addition to the 2 x 4 loop geometry. It has been suggestedthat unique design features of the B and W reactor may produce uniqueand complex thermo-hydraulic behavior during system transients. Flowvisualization experiments were performed in a simulation loop. The experimentalcondition simulated the two-phase flow in a B and W primary loop duringa small break loss of coolant accident or during some other abnormaltransients. The loop design was based on the scaling criteria developedpreviously and the loop was operated either in a natural circulationmode or in a forced circulation mode using nitrogen gas and water.</TEXT></DOC>
