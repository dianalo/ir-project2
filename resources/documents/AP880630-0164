The national association of auto clubs performs a wide varietyof services for its nearly 30 million members, Nader said. But that``contrasts with its abdication of the consumer cause in otherquite consequential fronts,'' he said.   Nader's charges came in a 10-page letter addressed to AAAPresident James B. Creal.   He was critical of the club for generally opposing governmentregulations, for example, pointing to club statements that safetyand emissions rules should not be imposed without verifiableevidence of their need and value.   Nader asserted that the AAA has been weak in its efforts toencourage more recalls and said the organization has too quicklyaccepted as adequate industry efforts to improve fuel efficiency.   And he was critical of club support of higher speed limits,limited member involvement, its cautious position on mass transitand club activities in insurance.   Asked about the letter, J. Kay Aldous, a vice president of theFalls Church, Va.-based AAA, said: ``We don't plan to reapond otherthan to say that Ralph Nader is like a 17-year locust. He emergedJuly 1, 1971, to make the same irresponsible charges.''</TEXT></DOC>
