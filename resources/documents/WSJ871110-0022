Southmark, a financial services concern, said it now owns 16.1 million shares of Thousand Trails, a Bellevue, Wash.-based, campground operator. Dallas-based Southmark acquired 2.4 million of those shares from Western Savings andamp; Loan Association of Phoenix, Ariz., in exchange for 280,000 shares of Southmark Series H 9 1/4% cumulative convertible preferred stock.    Southmark acquired the remaining 13.7 million shares from Thousand Trails by purchasing and canceling $44.6 million of Thousand Trails' 14 5/8% senior subordinated notes owed to Western and about $50 million in Thousand Trails bank debt. Southmark swapped some convertible notes, preferred stock and a previously acquired asset of Thousand Trails to acquire Thousand Trails' debt.    Southmark also received $30 million of Thousand Trails' receivables. As a result of the transaction, Southmark said Thousand Trails' debt has been reduced to $75 million from about $170 million and its net worth, or assets minus liabilities, has increased to $81 million from $17 million.    Southmark said it expects to receive a majority of the seats on Thousand Trails' board as a result of the transaction.    Thousand Trails closed at $2.44, up 69 cents, in national over-the-counter trading yesterday. Southmark closed at $5.625, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
