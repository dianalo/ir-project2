A mass of warm and humid air spawned the severe storms andtwisters in a wide band from the Gulf Coast states to New England,with Georgia, Alabama, Tennessee, Kentucky and the Carolinas thehardest hit.   In North Carolina, a house under construction near Lillingtoncollapsed in the high winds, killing one worker and injuring threeothers, authorities said.   Wind tore off a quarter of the roof at a one-story elementaryschool in Morven, N.C., while classes were in session, saidsheriff's dispatcher Elaine Lear in Wadesboro. No one was injured,and pupils were sent home.   ``We had just had our tornado drill last week so that childrenknew exactly what to do,'' said school secretary Gloria Truman.``They were out of the classroom and in the hallway in about 15seconds. They were perfect. You could not ask for them to be anybetter.''   Also in south-central North Carolina, the wind flipped overseveral small planes at Anson County Airport. Four people receivedminor injuries when the wind tossed around trailer homes near EagleSprings and Zion's Grove, said a dispatcher.   Up to 3,500 customers were without electricity in the Rockinghamand Wadesboro areas, Carolina Power and Light spokesman Kyle Hamptonsaid.   Temperatures reached the high 80s in some Florida cities Tuesday,but a cold snap was expected to push readings into the teens byWednesday. The forecast forced the National Weather Service tocancel its annual statewide tornado drill planned for Wednesdaybecause severe weather was on the way.   ``You don't want a test going on when you have the real thing,''said forecaster Ray Biedinger.   Kentucky and Tennessee, which logged up to 11 inches of rain lastweek, received more rain Monday and Tuesday, sending rivers risingagain. Temperatures were expected to dip below freezing overnight.   The storm system dumped more than 3 additional inches of water onparts of southern Kentucky before rains began to subside Tuesdayafternoon.   South of Louisville, crews lowered a second pump by helicopter tothe Lebanon Junction levee after the Rolling Fork of the Salt Riveroverflowed its banks. Officials said the pump being used to removeflood water from inside the levee couldn't keep up with the latestrainfall.   Police said the rain has contributed to the death of at least twopeople in Kentucky _ a 19-year-old woman killed when her car hit atruck on a rain-slick highway and a man whose van was swept away byflood waters Thursday. Officials were still searching Tuesday for asecond man who had been in the van.   In western Kentucky, the Green River crest is being delayed byflooding on the Ohio River, which was expected to crest at Owensboroat 44 feet, 4 feet above flood stage.   The Ohio's high level has backed up operations at the OwensboroRiverport Authority. Grain can't be loaded onto barges again untilwater levels fall enough for the barges to move under a fixedloading spout, said port director Janet Douglas. She didn't expectnormal operations to resume until later in the week.   The neaby Owensboro Grain Co. can load barges because its dock ison higher ground, said traffic manager Ron Edge, but the high waterlevels have prevented unloading incoming soybean shipments.   Heavy rains blocked sections of at least 170 roads in 56 ofKentucky's 120 counties on Tuesday, said Don Armstrong, a spokesmanfor the state Division of Disaster and Emergency Services. He saidas many as 2,000 Kentuckians have evacuated their homes since lastweek. The exact number was unknown because many people left on theirown.   Storms brought 2 more inches of rain to parts of Tennessee,flooding a few roads, but no evacuations were ordered, authoritiessaid.   In southeastern Alabama, a tornado cut a path about a mile longnear Wicksburg early Tuesday, damaging several roofs and bringingdown trees and power lines, said Bobby Clemmons, director ofemegency management services in Houston County. School in the mostlyrural county was called off.   The heavy rain flooded streets and homes in Florence, Ala., inthe northwest corner, causing the sewer system to overflow, but onlyone family was evacuated, said George Mangum, director of LauderdaleCounty Emergency Management.   In South Carolina, high wind swept through Lexington andChesterfield counties, overturning mobile homes and uprooting trees,authorities said.   The storms may have spawned a tornado that a Chesterfield Countydeputy saw touch down near Jefferson, said Everette Campbell, thejail administrator for the sheriff's department. Several trailersand turkey barns were damaged but no injuries were reported, he said.   About 500 utility customers in southwest Georgia were withoutpower Tuesday morning, but service was restored to all but a fewisolated areas by midday, said Teresa Callaway of Pataula ElectricMembership Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
