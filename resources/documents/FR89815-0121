Lessey, Jr.,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director of Selective Service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Health Care Personnel Delivery System_(HCPDS)</ITAG>Part I_Introduction 1. <T3>General. </T3>Section 715 of Public Law 100-180, signed by the Presidenton December 4, 1987, directed the Selective Service System (SSS) to developa system, capable of immediate operation in the event of a national emergency,for the postmobilization registration and delivery of health care personnelto the Department of Defense (DOD) in the required number, mix, and timeframe.\1\ This paper recommends an operational concept for a standby HealthCare Personnel Delivery System (HCPDS) as prescribed by that law. Thisoperational concept will be the basis for developing detailed implementingpolicies and procedures, including an automated data processing (ADP) functionaldescription. A system flow chart which presents a graphic overview is atAnnex A. Subsequent implementation will include development of an HCPDSmobilization timetable, prototype forms, reports, operational manual policiesand procedures, and other specific details and products as required. Althoughthe operational concept presented is consistent with the latest positionof DOD and selected Federal agencies, it remains subject to change as:May be directed by Selective Service leadership.Progress is made in obtaining more definitive delivery schedules from DOD.DOD initiatives directed at reducing wartime military health care personnelshortfalls reduce mobilization requirements. May be required upon receipt of comments from DOD and outside sources,including health care personnel associations. 2. <T3>Scenario. </T3>Selective Service was charged to develop a postmobilizationsystem. Accordingly, the HCPDS components covered here are those whichare crucial to responding to DOD's initial mobilization requirements ina worst case, conventional conflict scenario involving little or no warning.Maximum effort is being devoted to ensuring that the initial postmobilizationcomponents are operational as soon as practicable within the constraintsimposed. Within that context, this paper provides for those crucial HCPDScomponents. 3. <T3>Definition of Terms. </T3>See Annex B, Definitions, Abbreviations,and Acronyms. 4. <T3>Objectives. </T3>This operational concept is based upon the followingobjectives and characteristics: rapid response, equity, flexibility, simplicity,workability, acceptability, balancing military and civilian needs, parallelingthe procedures of the Registrant Information and Management System (RIMS)where practicable, and interfacing with RIMS.5. <T3>Facts</T3>_a. <T3>Congressional and presidential authorization required. </T3>No SelectiveService processing of health care personnel (registration, classification,selection, or issuance of induction orders) can be undertaken until theCongress provides statutory authority and the President directs such processing.b. <T3>Legislation. </T3>A standby legislative package was coordinated previouslywith DOD, including the Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) and the military services.That legislative package, when enacted, would provide the authority toprocess health care personnel for induction upon mobilization. The Officeof the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Force Management and Personnel(OASD-FMandamp;P) now has this legislative package and plans to include itin a DOD Emergency Actions Packet. The HCPDS concept was developed withinthe framework of that proposed legislation. Changes to this legislationhave been developed and submitted to DOD by letter to ensure full compatibilitywith the HCPDS. c. <T3>Inability to meet DOD requirements. </T3>DOD understands that SelectiveService cannot meet DOD's ``worst-case scenario'' mobilization requirementsfor health care personnel. Selective Service will be reviewing optionsto ensure that time frames are as realistic and short as possible. Thespeed with which Selective Service can implement HCPDS and begin makingfirst health care personnel deliveries is dependant upon the level of preliminarypreparation authorized and achieved. Technical advancements and improvedcontingency agreements will be reviewed to reduce time frames. d. <T3>Continued DOD recruiting. </T3>DOD plans to undertake a major healthcare personnel recruiting effort upon any mobilization and continue recruitingfrom among health care registrants at least through M+90, the same as DODplans for recruiting untrained manpower from among regular registrants.Selective Service will not accept and process health care personnel asvolunteers for induction during that period at mobilization. A proposedrevision to the Military Selective Service Act (MSSA) provides authorityfor the addition of a volunteer program by regulation should the need arise.e. <T3>Inclusion of females. </T3>No question exists that Congress will makethe final decision at the proper time, whether to include females withmales, and the mix, if other than on a full share basis, in any healthcare personnel draft. This concept envisions including females withoutrestriction. To be prepared for any contingency, the HCPDS will be constructedto accommodate males alone or any mix of the two as prescribed by properauthority. 6. <T3>DOD Mobilization Requirements.</T3> DOD continues to refine the numbersof health care personnel needed for mobilization. Annex D shows DOD's requirementsby individual titles of specialties provided to Selective Service. Theserequirements listed shortfalls of 109,948 health care personnel which couldrequire delivery starting at D+10 in a worst case scenario. The mobilizationrequirements are based on assumptions and computer modeling and subjectto change. The HCPDS will be flexible enough to respond to such changes,i.e. in specialties, numbers, and/or delivery times. 7. <T3>Use of RIMS Methods.</T3> RIMS, the system designed to process regularregistrants, has been evaluated in many mobilization exercises. The systemhas been enhanced and has proven an effective registrant processing system.Portions of the HCPDS concept are modeled on some of the tested operationaland ADP methods, forms, and reports where practicable. Functionally, HCPDSwill perform many RIMS tasks and operations, but the ``how'' and ``when''of actually performing these operational and ADP tasks in many instancesare quite different. The integration of the health care system with currentsystems and procedures enables Selective Service to accelerate development,conserve resources, and provide for ease of administration vs. a ``standingstart.'' Besides annotating the records of dual registrants, discussedlater herein, this integration of systems may very well impact the existingregular registrant RIMS in some other ways. 8. <T3>Follow-on Developmental Efforts.</T3> Selective Service follow-on effortswill include the development of additional HCPDS components, a ``steady-state''operating system, logistical support plans and agreements, and plans forexercising and, if necessary, refining the system components. a. <T3>HCPDS components.</T3> Additional HCPDS components, not critical tomeeting the initial requirements, include the induction of overseas registrants,a Compliance System Component, and an Alternative Service System Component.These important components will be added later and utilize as much of theexisting systems as practicable. b. <T3>``Steady-state'' system.</T3> After any postmobilization activationand initial operations, Selective Service expects a transition to a ``steady-state''operating system for health care registrants similar to that being developedfor regular registrants. To the extent practicable, HCPDS emergency procedureswill be designed for the transaction to a steady-state HCPDS operation.\2\9. <T3>Coordination and Approval.</T3>_a. <T3>General.</T3> Selective Service has informally coordinated this paperwith other Federal agencies. Approval of an operational concepts for HCPDSby the Director is required before finalizing a detailed functional descriptionand building an automated system. b. <T3>Coordination with DOD.</T3> Coordination with DOD is required on proposedlegislation, the registration proclamation, requirements, and proposedinduction policies and procedures. c. <T3>Coordination with other Government agencies.</T3> Coordination withseveral other government agencies is also required. There are many agencieswith mobilization authorities, responsibilities, and plans which relateto this project. Interagency factors will be identified and addressed tomake HCPDS an integral part of overall national policies and plans. Thefollowing agencies have roles which interface with the Selective ServiceSystem in the development of the HCPDS procedures. <ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Policy planning agencies </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Office of Management and Budget (OMB)\3\ </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Veterans Administration (VA) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Support agencies </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">U.S. Postal Service (USPS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of State (DOS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Internal Revenue Service (IRS) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Social Security Administration (SSA) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Government Printing Office (GPO) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Department of Justice (DOJ) </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Other agencies as required. </ITAG>d. <T3>Interface with health care associations.</T3> This HCPDS concept hasbeen the subject of informal discussion with several health care associations.\4\Additional such coordination with these associations is planned as theconcept is further refined. e. <T3>Public comment.</T3> Publication in The <T4>Federal Register</T4> is planned. 10. <T3>Maintenance of System.</T3> A completed and tested HCPDS plan wouldgo ``on the shelf'' and be periodically reviewed, updated, and tested tokeep it viable for implementation. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part II_Registration</ITAG>1. <T3>General.</T3>_a. <T3>Who.</T3> The registration of civilian health care personnel will berequired as specified in a Presidential Proclamation. Active duty militarypersonnel and lawfully admitted nonimmigrant aliens are exempt from registrationas provided by the MSSA. Those registered will include only individualswho are professionally qualified, or who later become so qualified, andwho are age 20 through 44 inclusive.\5\ Males already registered as regularregistrants are required to register again as health care personnel. Boththeir regular registrant records and HCPDS records will be annotated.\6\A registrant will be registered in no more than one medical specialty ata time, the specialty with the highest education and/or experience requirements,with due consideration being given to skill specialties considered in criticallyshort supply. b. <T3>Where.</T3> Registration sites now used for regular registrants willbe used. The current sites for regular registration are U.S. Postal Service(USPS) classified sites within the States, possessions, and territories,and Department of State (DOS) posts overseas. Additional registration siteswill be used if required.\7\ c. <T3>How.</T3> Registration of health care personnel will be conducted intwo major phases: an initial mass registration followed by continuous registration.Special supplemental registration(s) of additional health care personnelwould be conducted if dictated by the developing situation. Registrationprocedures will parallel those currently used for regular registrants wherepossible. Where necessary, existing procedures will be modified or newprocedures developed. d. <T3>Support. </T3>Rapid collection of registration information requiresADP support by outside agencies and/or contractors because regular registrantinduction processing would utilize fully the available processing capability.Forms and materials will be distributed initially by the printing contractor,in predetermined size packs, using USPS and DOS distribution plans. ReplacementUSPS stocks will be positioned at USPS Management Sectional Centers (MSC)until adequate stocks are placed in the two USPS Supply Centers. DOS replacementstocks will be positioned at Selective Service National Headquarters. e. <T3>Flow chart. </T3>See the system flow chart, annex A. 2. <T3>Initial Mass Registration. </T3>Persons who are of registration ageon the base date established and who are qualified as health care specialistswill be required to register in the mass registration. The base date willbe a date about six months in advance of the first day of the mass registration.Both these dates will be established in the registration proclamation.This registration will last approximately seven days including weekendsin order to accomplish the anticipated 3.4 million registrations. 3. <T3>Continuous Registration. </T3>Continuous registration commences twoweeks after the end of the initial mass registration. The following personswill be required to register: Those becoming newly qualified as healthcare specialists required to register; Those qualified health care personnelof an age and of a health care occupation required by a registration proclamationto be registered; \8\ Those required to register previously who failedto do so. 4. <T3>Special Mass Registration. </T3>To cover additional specialities and/orage groups, special mass registrations could be conducted, but will beavoided if at all possible.\9\5. <T3>Registration Material Production and Distribution_</T3>a. <T3>Items for registration sites. </T3>Stocks of the following items requiredto implement health care personnel registration will be printed and deliveredto each using site in the Continental United States (CONUS): RegistrationForms; Instruction/Information sheets for the persons completing registrationforms; Instruction sheets for registration site personnel; Mailing/controlforms for use by registration site personnel.\1\\0\b. <T3>Advance arrangements. </T3>Camera ready prototypes of each item willbe prepared in enough copies to satify printing at regionally located contractorsites. Emergency requisition will be placed with UNICOR,\1\\1\ or otherGPO approved printing facilities, in advance for expedited action on M-Day,or earlier, in event authority to print should be received prior to M-Day.Requisitions will specify various sized packages of the items for directdelivery to the using sites. Electronic delivery of prototype forms andmaterials for use at DOS posts is being explored. c. <T3>Distribution</T3>.(1) <T3>USPS. </T3>Shipments to USPS sites will be presorted by the contractorinto MSC groupings and addressed to the ultimate registration site. (2) <T3>DOS. </T3>Predetermined sized packages will go forward to each DOSpost via Air Pouch to ensure the most reasonable delivery time if a programof electronic transmission cannot be implemented. (3) <T3>Other possibilities. </T3>Additional means of providing registrationforms to registrants will be explored as backup for supplemental methodsof facilitating the registration of health care personnel, such as by directmail or as stuffers in health care oriented newspapers or periodicals (involvinga mail-in registration form), or through the use of registrars who wouldreport to facilities having large concentrations of health care personnelto be registered. 6. <T3>Collection of Registration Information</T3>_a. <T3>USPS Sites</T3>_(1) <T3>Initial mass registration. </T3>Initially, each individual registrationsite will forward completed forms on a daily basis to a predesignated controland processing point for counting, batching, keying, and microfilming/indexingduring the mass registration period where practicable. That facility willaccomplish the stated control measures before forwarding the source documentsto the selected input points for collection and initial processing of theregistration input. IRS, SSA, UNICOR, and/or other agencies may be usedin this regard. Input will be collected and transmitted to the SelectiveService Data Management Center (DMC) on a daily basis. After collectionof the registration input, original source documents would be forwardedto Selective Service as established in Memoranda of Understanding. (2) <T3>Continuous registration. </T3>During continuous registration, formswill be forwarded every Friday. The input center(s) will forward inputresults to the DMC, which will consolidate and process the input from allregistration sites. The DMC will produce listings and resolve abnormalfile conditions utilizing available resources. In each instance tape orother appropriate backup will be provided to SSS along with the originalsource document(s). b. <T3>DOS. </T3>State Department posts will return completed forms to thesingle designated Selective Service control processing point on a weeklybasis using Air Mail or Air Pouch. Further processing would be identicalto that shown in 6a above. c. <T3>Tranmittal and control. </T3>Control/report forms will be mailed eachtime a site forwards completed registration forms or transmitted registrationdata. One copy will be enclosed with the mailing. If transmitted electronicallyor by magnetic tape, a header will contain information normally includedon the hard copy control/report form mailed with completed forms. 7. <T3>Error Correction. </T3>Error correction and/or data base editing willbe accomplished by SSS primarily using written contact with the registrant.8. <T3>Registration Acknowledgments. </T3>Official registration acknowledgmentswill be mailed in the same manner as for regular registrants. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part III_Selection and Induction</ITAG>1. <T3>General. </T3>The proposed selection and induction portion of the HCPDSInduction, Claims, and Appeals automated system parallels, inasmuch aspracticable, the current version of the RIMS Manual which describes regularregistrant procedures that are ready to become operational in the eventof a full-scale military mobilization; it is essentially a one-step combinedexamination/induction process. 2. <T3>PSG-M Assignment. </T3>The first step in the induction process is theassignment of a Random Sequence Number (RSN) and Priority Selection Group_Medical(PSG-M) to each registrant record. Health care personnel registering inthe initial mass registration will have their registration records establishedin the HCPDS data base as a group on the same date and will be assignedRSN's from a Selectvie Service lottery held upon mobilization. All registrantsfrom the initial mass registration will be assigned to the First PrioritySelection Group-Medical (PSG-M) for 365 consecutive days, which periodconstitutes their year of prime vulnerability. The clock will start onthe same day for all initial mass registrants. The first priority groupwill also include other health care personnel, either late mass registrationsor continuous registrants who register later, using their accession dateas a start date. Each of these registrants will remain in the first priorityfor an individual 365 day period, starting with the establishment of avalid registration record in the data base. An RSN from a lottery tablewill be assigned to each new record. 3. <T3>Selection. </T3>Selection of health care registrants for inductionwithin their specialty is based upon: Priority Selection Group-Medical;Year of Birth (YOB), within the PSG-M,\1\\2\ from youngest to oldest; RandomSequence Number within each individual YOB group. If registrants are depleted in the First Priority Selection Group, selectioncontinues from the second and then progressively lower selection groups.<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">insert illus. 474 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/> This illustration shows three registrants: the first registered at thecompletion of the initial mass registration in month 1 (e.g. April); thesecond and third registered later when they became qualified as healthcare personnel, one in month 4 (August), and the other during month 8 (December).From months 8 through 12 (December through March) all are in the FirstPSG-M together. If none of the three are reached for induction, RegistrantNo. 1 moves to the second priority group in month 13 (i.e. the next April),Registrant No. 2 moves to second priority the next August, and registrantNo. 3 the next December. 4.<T3> Overcall.</T3> In order to ensure that DOD requirements are met, enoughregistrants must be ordered for induction to cover losses due to postponement,deferment and exemption requests, failures to report, and disqualificationsby DOD. a.<T3> DOD rejection rates.</T3> Under the former ``doctors' draft,'' registrantspracticing their professions in the private sector were considered ableto do the same in a military health care environment notwithstanding physicalconditions which would cause rejection as a regular registrant. If similarstandards are applied under an HCPDS scenario, the DOD rejection rate forhealth care personnel should be significantly lower than that estimatedfor regular registrants. b.<T3> Other fall-out rates.</T3> It is likely that the overcall rate willvary depending upon the specialty called and the demographics of the populationbeing ordered. Registrants in the technical level specialties will havedifferent postponement, deferment, and exemption rates than will physicians.Populations which are principally female, such as nurses or dental technicians,may have many mothers who could request hardship deferments.Estimates of the expected fall-out rate will be made using the best historicaland demographic data available. These losses will then be converted toan overcall factor and this factor applied to each specialty required byDOD in order to determine the PSG, YOB, and RSN cut off number used toselect the registrants to be called for induction.5.<T3> Sequence of Processing.</T3> The sequence of SSS actions for selectionand induction follows: a. Receive specific requisition from DOD.b. Calculate the number of registrants to be ordered for induction by specialtyto meet the DOD requirement and set PSG-M/YOB/RSN cut-off for each specialty.c. Select and order registrants for induction by specialty according tothe order of call shown below.d. Process registrant claims for postponement, deferment, and/or exemption.6.<T3> Order of Call.</T3> Registrants will be selected for induction inthe following sequence:a. Registrants whose claims have been denied, registrants whose ``reexaminationbelieved justified'' dates have expired, and registrants who have beenclassified 1-A-OM.b. Registrants whose postponements have expired in the order of the dateof expiration of the postponement. If necessary, the RSN shall be usedas a tie breaker for registrants in a postponement expired status.c. Registrants whose deferments have expired or who no longer qualify forexemption in RSN sequence. Selection will begin with registrants from theyoungest YOB groups, then by RSN. d. Registrants in the First Priority Selection Group_Medical. Selectionwill begin with registrants from the youngest YOB group, then by RSN.e. Registrants in the Second and succeedingly lower Priority SelectionGroups_Medical in the same manner as above.7.<T3> Induction.</T3> a.<T3> Assignment to local board and area office.</T3> Assignment to a LocalBoard and Area Office will be made at the time the registrant is initiallyselected for induction based on the registrant's permanent address. TheZIP Code Assignment File will be used to determine the local board/areaoffice covering the registrant's permanent address ZIP Code.b.<T3> Scheduling to MEPS and issuance of induction order.</T3> Registrantswill be scheduled to a MEPS on the basis of their permanent address ZIPCode in accord with the ZIP Code Assignment File. An alternate MEPS, asspecified in the file, will be used to adjust for overfill/underfill atthe individual MEPS. The first induction notice will be mailed to the currentaddress. Registrants will be ordered by mailgram to report to the MEPSon a date not earlier than 10 days from the date of mailing of the order.The orders will specify the documentation required to determine professionalqualifications and thus each will be tailored to the specialty called.Registrants initially ordered for induction will be issued an ``Order toReport for Induction.'' Previously ordered registrants will be issued eitheran ``Order to Report for Induction'' or a ``Notice of Rescheduled InductionReporting Date'' depending on their current status. Procedures will bethe same as those which exist in RIMS. Registrants residing overseas willbe issued orders by letter and will be scheduled to report to an overseasmilitary location. c.<T3> MEPS processing.</T3> When an ordered registrant appears at the MEPS,he is examined to determine physical, moral, and professional/technicalqualifications. The results of this processing are entered into the MEPSreporting system and transmitted to SSS via MEPCOM.8.<T3> Information for registrants.</T3> A publication similar to the currentInformation for Registrants booklet will be available to the public atPost Offices and all Selective Service Offices to provide additional informationon induction and claims processing. 9. <T3>Dual Registrants.</T3> Dual registrants are those who register bothas regular and as health care registrants. As mentioned in Part II_Registration,records of dual registrants will be annotated to denote inclusion in bothdata bases. Once a record is annotated on the RIMS data base, processingas a regular registrant ceases and further processing takes place underHCPDS procedures from the HCPDS data base.\1\\3\<ITAG tagnum="84">Part IV_Classification, Claims, and Appeals</ITAG>1. <T3>General.</T3> Classification is the exercise of the authority to determineclaims or questions on inclusion or exemption from training and serviceunder the MSSA. The narrative in this Part and the flow chart at AnnexA describe the proposed classification, claims, and appeals component ofthe HCPDS concept. This component is crucial to ensuring the protectionof all registrants' rights. The basic classification structure establishedfor RIMS will be used for health care registrant processing. Where practicable,this system will incorporate current regular registrant processing procedurescontained in RIMS.2. <T3>Classification Structure. </T3>The various classification bodies andthe authority of each are as follows:a. Upon activation of HCPDS, the Director of Selective Service assignsclassification 1-HM (not currently subject to induction processing) toall health care registrants. Upon receipt of a requisition for health carepersonnel from the Secretary of Defense, all health care registrants selectedfor induction are assigned to Class 1-AM (available for unrestricted militaryservice). In addition, the Director will classify a health care registrantinto an appropriate class when the Secretary of Defense has certified theregistrant to be a member of the Armed Forces, active or reserve, or theregistrant has been found disqualified for service.b. The Director will authorize Area Offices to classify a health care registrantwho has been ordered to report for induction into any administrative classificationfor which he has filed a claim and documented his eligibility. Area Officepersonnel will initially decide administrative claims. Claims denied byArea Office personnel are subject to Local Board review, when requestedby the registrant.c. A Local Board may classify a health care registrant into any judgmentalclass that he has requested and for which he is eligible. Claims deniedby a Local Board are subject to appeal when requested by the registrant,the State Director, or the Director.d. A District Appeal Board may classify a health care registrant into anyclass that he requested and for which he is eligible when a Local Boarddenial of a claim is appealed.e. The National Appeal Board may classify a health care registrant intoany class that he requested and for which he is eligible when a DistictAppeal Board denial of a claim is appealed to the President (National AppealBoard).3. <T3>Classifications_Deferments_Exemptions_</T3>a. <T3>Classification categories. </T3>To expedite the classification processand reduce the volume of claims to be decided by the Local Board, the classificationcategories have been divided into two groups: administrative and judgmental.Administrative classification claims are established on the basis of officialdocuments required for each classification. Judgmental claims for reclassificationare those requiring a Local Board to determine whether the evidence submittedmeets the criteria established for the requested classification. Administrativeand judgmental classifications are identified in annex E. Health care registrantclassifications will contain an ``M'' suffix for prompt identificationand for statistical purposes.b. <T3>Registrant's responsibility. </T3>Upon issuance of an Order to Reportfor Induction, a registrant may file a written claim for postponement ofinduction and/or reclassification with any Selective Service Area Office.The registrant's induction date is automatically delayed by the submissionof a claim, pending resolution of the claim. A registrant must file concurrentlyall claims for classes for which he believes he is eligible, within thetime period designated on his induction order. Any registrant who filesa claim must document his eligibility to the satisfaction of the Area Officeor the Local Board depending on the type of claim filed. The registrantmay submit a statement as well as statements of other persons to provethe factual basis of his claim, in addition to any specific form(s) orother type of documentation required for the classification requested.Registrants, who do not file claims or whose claims are denied, are expectedto report for induction as ordered.Health care registrants are required to report changes in their statuson which a claim is based to Selective Service within 10 days of the datesuch change occurs.4. <T3>Postponements.</T3> Postponement does not cancel an induction order,but results in a rescheduled induction reporting date. Postponement isa statutory or administrative delay of a registrant's induction reportingdate. Health care registrants will be eligible for postponements the sameas regular registrants and for the same reasons as prescribed in RIMS.Each postponement shall be granted to a specific date but may be terminatedat any time prior to the expiration date if the reason for which it wasgranted ceases to exist. At the expiration or termination of a postponement,the health care registrant will be rescheduled for induction.a. <T3>Types of postponements.</T3> There are two types of postponements,statutory and administrative.Statutory postponements are those authorized by the MSSA to permit satisfactory,full-time students to complete the term or semester in which they are enrolledat the time they are ordered for induction. If the registrant is in thelast academic year, the postponement may be granted until the end of thatacademic year.Administrative postponements are those specifically authorized by SelectiveService regulations. A health care registrant may be granted an administrativepostponement for the reasons and periods prescribed in RIMS when: thereis a family emergency beyond the registrant's control; the registrant incursan illness or injury; the registrant is scheduled for a state or nationalexamination to be eligible to practice his profession or occupation; theregistrant has been accepted at a military service academy or for one ofthe specified Reserve Officer Training Corps programs; or, the registrantis scheduled to be inducted on a religious holiday observed historicallyby the registrant's rcognized church, religious sect, or organization.b. <T3>Postponing authorities. </T3>Registrants who believe they qualify forpostponement at the time they are ordered for induction should file a claimwith the Area Office and furnish the required documentation. Area Officepersonnel will decide the claim based on the documentation submitted bythe registrant. When a claim for student postponement is denied by theArea Office, the registrant may request the Local Board to review his claim.Other postponement denials are not subject to review or appeal. The MEPSLiaison Officer (MLO) who represents Selective Service at the MEPS is authorizedto grant a postponement of not more than ten days to a registrant whenan emergency occurs while the registrant is enroute to, or during processingat the MEPS.5. <T3>Basic Claims and Appeals Process. </T3>Health care registrants willbe eligible to file claims for all postponements, deferments, and exemptionsavailable to regular registrants. The filing of a claimn will delay theregistrant's reporting date until the claim is decided.a. <T3>Claims. </T3>Claims for postponements and administrative classifications,to include documented separations from military service because of hardshipor conscientious objection, will be initially decided by Area Office personnel,with denials of student postponements and administrative classificationssubject to Local Board review when requested by the registrant.(1) Claims for judgmental classifications, i.e., community essentiality,occupational deferment, hardship, conscientious objection, ministerialand ministerial student status, must be decided by the registrant's LocalBoard. Conscientious objector claimants are required to appear personallybefore the Local Board unless previously separated from military servicefor reasons of conscientious objection. Other judgmental claimants andregistrants requesting Local Board review of Area Office denials may askto appear before the Local Board to discuss the claim. Persons appearingbefore a Local Board are permitted to present up to three witnesses, usean interpreter if one is required, be accompanied by an advisor, and submitadditional written or oral information to support their claim. Registrantsmay not be represented at their personal appearance by anyone acting asan attorney or legal counsel.(2) Registrants are eligible for deferment or exemption only so long asthe reason for the deferment or exemption exists. Upon expiration of aregistrant's deferment or termination of a deferment or exemption, theregistrant will be returned to the available pool and ordered for inductionwith the next call for the specialty involved before those not previouslyordered are selected.b. <T3>Appeals.</T3> The HCPDS appeals process corresponds to the appealssystem established by RIMS for regular registrants. Health care registrantswill be offered the opportunity to request the Local Board to review anddecide any claim for student postponement or administrative classificationdenied by the Area Office. A Local Board decision to deny an administrativeclassification may be appealed to the District Appeal Board when the denialdecision is not unanimous. Any Local Board decision to deny a claim forjudgmental reclassification may be appealed to the District Appeal Board.A District Appeal Board claim denial may be appealed to the President (NationalAppeal Board) if the vote to deny is not unanimous. The decision of theNational Appeal Board is final and is not subject to further review orappeal.A health care registrant may appear personally before a District AppealBoard or the National Appeal Board, as applicable, to discuss his claim.A person appearing before an appeal board may use an interpreter if oneis required, be accompanied by an advisor, and submit additional writtenor oral information to support his claim. Registrants may not present witnessesor be represented at their personal appearance by anyone acting as an attorneyor legal counsel.6. <T3>Special Health Care Personnel Provisions_</T3>a. <T3>Special health care personnel deferments. </T3>In addition to all defermentsand exemptions available to regular registrants under RIMS, two new classesare provided under this system:(1) <T3>Community essentiality deferments. </T3>A Class 2-EM (community essentialityderferment) is being added to the judgmental classification category forthe health care registrants determined essential to the health care withintheir own communities. To qualify, health care registrants must be engagedin direct patient care. Class 2-EM will apply only to health care registrants.(2) <T3>Occupational deferments. </T3>Eligibility for occupational defermentmay be extended at the direction of the National Security Council to thosestaffing certain health care facilities, performing health care in a civiliancapacity related to war activities, teaching in medical schools, or engagedin research and development relating to long term public health. Class2-AM is designated for this type deferment, if and when authorized.b. <T3>Health care advisory boards</T3>_(1) <T3>State and local health care advisory boards. </T3>While both typesof these claims will be decided by the Local Board, it is important forthe Local Board to have an advisory board, fully cognizant of the civiliancommunity health care needs, to recommend on the validity of grounds fordeferment. These boards will make recommendations to the Local Boards onthe advisability of granting deferments. Section 10(b)(3) of the MSSA authorizesthe creation of such boards. Specific criteria for establishing these reviewboards will be included in Selective Service regulations. These boardswill review only the two types of deferment claims specified in 6a(1) and6a(2) above.\14\(2) <T3>National health care personnel advisory committee. </T3>A NationalHealth Care Personnel Advisory Committee will be established by regulation.The purpose of this committee will be to advise the Director on the administrationof those portions of the MSSA pertaining to the induction of health carepersonnel. Members of the committee will be appointed by the Director fromamong persons who are outstanding in the health occupations or who haveextensive knowledge or background in health care matters.c. <T3>No advance DOD examinations. </T3>SSS will adjudicate all claims priorto claimants' DOD examination and acceptance.\15\d. <T3>Forms and reports. </T3>Many existing RIMS forms and management reportswill be modified and used for HCPDS. Materials and publications pertainingonly to health care registrant processing will be identified and developedas the need arises.e. <T3>Area office terminal system (AOTS).</T3> A modifieid AOTS will be usedto transmit data to the DMC to update health care registrant records.7. <T3>Area Office Operational and Administrative Procedures. </T3>The LocalBoards, Appeal Boards, and Area Offices designed to function under RIMSwill perform like duties for Health Care Personnel. The Area office isresponsible for all administrative and operational support for the oneor more Local Boards within its jurisdiction. The Area Office Manager isin immediate charge of the Area Office and responsible for carrying outthe functions of that office.a. Area Offices are responsible to: assist registrants in filing claims;receive claims; accomplish postponements and administrative classificationactions; prepare registrant files for Local Board Classification actions;schedule personal appearances before Local Boards; assist Local Boardsin the conduct of their meetings; record official board actons; transmitregistrant information to the DMC to update the registrant data base; and,respond to inquiries from registrants, the media, and the public.b. Upon receipt of a registrant's claim for postponement or reclassification,Area Office personnel will verify that the registrant has been orderedto report for induction and, if so, prepare an individual Registrant FileFolder. The File Folder will be used for filing all documents pertainingto the registrant and for recording official actions relative to the registrant'sclaim(s) or circumstances.c. Health care registrant file folders will be maintained in the Area Officein a file system separate from that of regular registrants. The HCPDS filingsystem will parallel the regular registrant structure, but must providefor specialty categories and priority selection group divisions where required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Annex Description</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">A System Flow Chart</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">B Definitions, Abbreviations, and Acronyms</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">C Amendment to MSSA of December 4, 1987</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">D DOD Mobilization Shortfall Requirements Beginning at D+10</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">E SSS Classifications</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Footnotes</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">1. The amendment to the law and ``legislative intent'' materials areat Annex C. Although the wording of the amendment calls for a SelectiveService Health care Personnel Delivery System (HCPDS) on the same basisas the system for delivering regular registrants, specific constraintswere included in the legislative intent materials which preclude peacetimeregistration. No additional funds have been appropriated to carry out thisnew requirement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2. During the initial days of mobilization, with inductees requiredas soon as possible, the Nation cannot afford the extra time required toclassify and examine registrants before forwarding them for induction.The RIMS emergency procedures necessary to provide inductees as quicklyas possible lead to the development of the ``one-step'' process at MEPS,examination and immediate induction of those registrants found qualified.These procedures, although suitable for use during the early stages ofan emergency, are not intended for long term, steady state operation. SelectiveService can only estimate reporting rates because of the uncertainty regardingthe number of registrants who will file claims for deferment or exemption.Registrants will not know when they report for induction whether or notthey will be found qualified and inducted or disqualified and sent home.Therefore, transition to a system which provides for more orderly schedulingand flow of registrants to MEPS will occur as soon as practicable. Procedureswill call for ``two-step'' processing whereby registrants will receivea preinduction examination and have their claims for deferment or exemptionprocessed before being ordered to report for induction. Such a system willeliminate many of the show rate uncertainties inherent in the emergencyprocedures and provide greater registrant convenience. The steady statesystem is intended for implementation as a follow on to the emergency inductionprocedures. However, it could be implemented directly if advance warningwere available during a slow build up scenario.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3. At the appropriate time, OMB would be involved in the coordinationof the proposed health care personnel legislation with other interestedagencies.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4.

The proposed revision to the MSSA calls for liability for registrationand service to age 55 to provide a margin of additional registrants, ifneeded, but the proposed proclamation will call for registration of onlythose age 20 through 44, as DOD's requirements would likely be met by thisage group. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">6. As a part of the registration record processing, the HCPDS registrationrecords will be compared to the records in the regular registrant database. Whenever a ``match'' is achieved, both records would be flagged toindicate inclusion of the registrant on both data bases. Additonal processingof the regular registrant record would not occur, but that record wouldbe retained in an inactive status. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">7. For example, the feasibility of having registrars visit facilitieswith large concentrations of health care personnel will be explored asbackup methods of facilitating the registration of health care personnel.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">8. Registration under continuous registration would be required within15 days of the date the person became liable. In the case of immigrantaliens entering the country, this would be 15 days after such entry isotherwise required to register. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">9. If the situation required it, another proclamation would be issuedto require the registration of health care personnel in additional agegroups and/or specialties, as required. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">10. The control form could prove to be similar to the SSS Form 6 currentlyused by registration sites to control and submit regular registration formsto the DMC. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">11. UNICOR is a part of the Department of Justice, Bureau of Prisons,and is involved in production work by prisoners which has proven to beof good quality. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">12. Year of birth has been included as the second factor on whichrecords would be sorted in the selection procedure in order to ensure thata youngest first order of induction is maintained. A youngest first selectionorder has several benefits. Younger registrants generally will be lesscritical to the continued maintenance of an adequate level of health careservices in their communities. They also will have had less time to establishpractices resulting in fewer claims for community essentiality and postponementsto settle business affairs. Reduced claim rates will speed deliveries toDOD. There should be minimal increase in financial hardship claims becausehealth care registrants are to enter military service as commissioned officers,as warrant officers, or in advanced enlisted grades as determined by theDOD. This may be offset, however, by an increased claim rate from youngerpeople having younger children and thereby more frequently claiming familyhardship. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">13. Men who would be required to register both as regular registrantsand as health care registrants represented a potential problem area. Ina future draft, unless special provision were made, a man between age 20and age 26 qualified in a health care occupation would have two SelectiveService records: one in RIMS and one in HCPDS. He could be reached forinduction and processed under either system, in effect giving him doubleexposure to the draft until age 26. Female health care registrants wouldnot be subject to induction under the regular registrant system and maleregistrants 26 and older would not be subject to induction under both systemsat the same time. Additionally, induction of health care registrants asregular registrants would deplete the pool of much needed health care personnel.In an effort to eliminate potential problems, this concept calls for processingall health care registrants under HCPDS procedures only. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">14. Advisory Committees, composed of representatives of health careprofessions, were used in the past and were effctive in reviewing and makingrecommendations to Local Boards on such claims. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">15. The primary reason for the provision in RIMS to examine regularregistrants prior to considering their judgmental claims was to reducethe Local Board workload by eliminating claim processing for registrantswho would be rejected at the MEPS. Historically, the rejection rate ofpersonnel in the ``doctors' draft'' was extremely low compared to the ratefor regular registrants, resulting in no significant reduction in the numberof claims requiring Local Board adjudication. Another factor that influencedthis decision is the MEPS workload at the time health care registrantswould begin reporting for processing. MEPS capacities could be strainedby adding health care personnel processing to the ongoing processing ofregular registrants. Judgmental claims processing by Local Boards priorto examination would eliminate MEPS processing of those who would eventuallybe granted deferments or exemptions. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 8015-01-M001</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="42">Insert illustration 3 490</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 8015-01-C</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Annex B_Definitions, Abbreviations, and Acronyms</ITAG><T3>Base Date. </T3>A date selected in advance, and incorporated into theinitial registration proclamation, on which any given person would havebeen practicing or performing his specialty.
