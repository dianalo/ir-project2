The confrontation was one of the worst between Israelis since thePalestinian uprising against Israel's occupation of the West Bankand Gaza Strip began 13 months ago. The settlers, given governmentincentives to move to the occupied lands, have accused the army offailing to protect them from Arab attacks.   Also Sunday, two young Palestinians were reported dead afterclashes with troops. The deaths brought to six the number of Arabyouths reported killed by army gunfire in the past three days.   Arab hospital officials said seven Palestinians were shot andwounded Sunday in clashes in the West Bank, but a military spokesmansaid the army could confirm one injury. An Arab mother said soldiersbeat her 5-year-old son and broke his skull. The army denied it.   At least 357 Palestinians and 15 Israelis, including taxi driverShmuel Edri, have been killed during the rebellion in the landsIsrael seized in the 1967 Middle East War.   Edri, 42, of Tel Aviv, was shot twice in the chest this monthnear the Jewish settlement of Yakir, 25 miles north of Jerusalem.Police found footprints of two people leading from the car to theArab village of Bani Hassan, Israel radio said.    Edri's brothers and sisters, supported by dozens of militantJewish settlers, renewed a confrontation with the army Sunday overthe memorial they first built Wednesday near their settlement. Theclashes degenerated into fistfights last week.   The army opposes the monument, because the military bars settlersfrom conducting any activities outside their communities withoutmilitary permission.   After the army first destroyed the monument Thursday, Edri'sfamily rebuilt it. Radio reports said troops tore it down againSunday, but the settlers rebuilt it.   Troops then forcibly removed settlers who refused to leave andalso convinced Edri's relatives to leave, Israel Radio said.   Soldiers then tore down the monument again, said a militarysource. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said thearmy closed off the area around the site to block any more settlersor supporters.   Edri's four brothers and two sisters doused themselves withgasoline and threatened to commit suicide if the army destroyed thememorial again, they said on Israel Radio Sunday morning.   ``What have we asked for after all?: just a stone, a memorial forhim,'' Shula Edri, a sister, shouted on the radio. ``I repeat again:I am going to burn myself!''   About 65,000 Jewish settlers live in the West Bank in communitiesapart from the territory's 850,000 Arabs.   In the renewed Palestinian unrest Sunday, Mariam Jibril said her5-year-old son, Samer, was taken to Mukassed Hospital in EastJerusalem with a skull fracture after he was beaten by soldiers withclubs. She told The Associated Press he was beaten near his home inthe Ein Beit Ulma refugee camp in the West Bank after someone threwstones at soldiers.   An army spokewoman, speaking on condition of anonymity in keepingwith army regulations, denied the account and said that the boy,according to his father, was injured as a result of a fall.   ``The boy's father was stopped at an army roadblock and said theboy had fallen and he was taking him to the hospital,'' she said.   Palestinians mounted a general strike throughout the occupiedterritories. The army clamped curfews on all eight refugee camps inthe Gaza Strip in an effort to prevent protests, Arab reporters said.   The West Bank youth killed Sunday was identified as MuhammadRushdi Aboushi, 18. Hospital officials said he was dead on arrivalat Ittihad Hospital in Nablus, and an Arab reporter said he was shotin a clash with soldiers in the village of Fara, near the West Bankcity of Nablus.   The second youth died in Israel's Tel Hashomer hospital afterbeing critically wounded by army gunfire Saturday, military sourcessaid. Arab reports identified him as 17-year-old Ziad Ahmed Radwanfrom Rafah in the Gaza Strip.</TEXT></DOC>
