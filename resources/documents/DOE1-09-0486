The developmentof NRC material control and accounting requirements over the years hasresulted in a number of refinements in system capabilities. A recentrule amendment will provide for more timely analysis of accounting datato enhance anomaly detection and resolution and thus provide for earlierdetection of possible theft or diversion. This, along with present initiativesin physical protection program areas, combine to provide increase assurancein capabilities to adequately protect special nuclear materials. Amongthe physical protection measures now under consideration are revisedrequirements for security force training and the establishment of a formalrequirement for tactical response exercises to evaluate security systemeffectiveness. In the international arena, full cooperation with theIAEA continues to be regarded as an important function. A recommendationin this area is to reconvene an international committee to review IAEAprograms for physical protection (INFCIRC 225). NRC activities in supportof these goals include the establishment of improving safeguards capabilities,requiring the reduction of enrichments used in nonpower reactor, thereduction of inventories of highly enriched uranium to levels actuallyneeded for nonpower reactor operations, the maintenance of comparablelevels of protection for weapons usable materials under Department ofEnergy and NRC programs, and continued support of IAEA initiatives andobjectives.</TEXT></DOC>
