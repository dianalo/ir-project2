The new House and Senate leadership came in for criticism lastmonth, even from their own party operatives, for seeming to be tooaccommodating with the president. The griping intensified afterHouse Speaker Thomas Foley and his team made a high-profile standagainst Bush's capital gains tax cut, and lost.   But in Washington such conditions are transitory. The past weekhas seen Congress defeat Bush on his constitutional amendment toban flag desecration; overwhelming House approval of an aid packagefor Poland and Hungary that is nearly twice what Bush wants; and ashowdown over federal funding for welfare abortions in rape andincest cases.   Bush on Saturday vetoed a spending bill that included theabortion funds, and while members of Congress concede an overrideattempt probably would not succeed, they are talking of sending thesame measure to Bush again.   ``I think we're back,'' said Rep. David Bonior, D-Mich., asenior member of the House leadership. ``Timing, strategy and someluck have added up to our being able to score some points.''   Asked about the Democratic resurgence, House GOP leader RobertMichel of Illinois shrugged.   ``It's like a ball game. Some innings you hit well and scoreruns,'' he said, recalling the ``wave of high popularity'' hisparty enjoyed a few weeks ago. But the winds have shifted, heacknowledged. ``If they're feeling good about some of thedevelopments in the last day or two, so be it.''   Democrats also seem increasingly emboldened to take Bush ondirectly, particularly for his response to the radical changestaking place in Eastern Europe.   In a speech last week, Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo.,concluded: ``George Bush appears to be determined to go down inhistory as the hesitation president. At least his first year inoffice could be titled, `The Year of Living Timidly.'''   The spending bill vetoed by Bush included money to pay forabortions for poor women who are victims of rape and incest. Thebill would have reversed a decade-old federal policy, a movepropelled by resurgent pro-choice forces.   But many Republicans are uncomfortable with a Bush veto, fearingit will put them on the losing side of another hot political issue.``This is just the wrong front on which to fight that battle,''said Rep. Bill Green, R-N.Y.   ``There's no question this is going to hurt the RepublicanParty,'' Sen. Bob Packwood, R-Ore., an abortion rights backer, saidon Cable News Network's ``Evans andamp; Novak'' show.   And on the flag issue, Bush's early endorsement of aconstitutional amendment at the Iwo Jima Memorial has proved lessthan the brilliant stroke it seemed at the time. Democrats'strategy to wait the issue out and evoke the sanctity of the Billof Rights has been vindicated.   In fact, it was two last-minute Republican converts _ Sens. JohnDanforth of Missouri and Warren Rudman of New Hampshire _ whohelped take the amendment down to defeat in the Senate.   House and Senate negotiators this week will wrestle with theissue which represented Bush's biggest policy victory to date, thecut in the tax rate on capital gains from the sale of holdings likestocks and real estate. While Bush's position prevailed in theHouse three weeks ago, he later lost in the Senate when it wasdropped from an anti-deficit bill.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, has said hedoesn't think the Senate will pass a capital gains cut this year,and said it was ``irresponsible'' to be pushing the initiative whenwhat Congress needs to do is cut the deficit.   ``I would like to see the president devote as much time tohistoric events in Western and Eastern Europe... I'd like to seehim devote a fraction of the time to that, that he is to thiscapital gains debacle,'' Mitchell said.   Congress also faces a deadline this week to pass a new stopgapspending bill to fund most government programs until the regularmoney bills can be enacted. The new spending measure will includeup to $2.5 billion in aid for victims of the California earthquake,as well as money for ongoing cleanup following Hurricane Hugo.</TEXT></DOC>
