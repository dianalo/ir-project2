(201) 348-5357.andM;List Price: With 640K RAM, one 720K 3.5-inch floppy disk drive, backlit CGAliquid crystal display, DOS 3.3 in ROM, utilities, $1,149.andM;In Short: A basic floppy-only portable with a readable backlit LCD and acomfortable keyboard, the Business Partner suffers from an anemic battery andan unnecessary pound or two.andP;  But given the limited competition in thelow-end notebook laptop market, the Panasonic CF-150B Business Partner is aviable choice if you want things kept simple.andM;You're probably more familiar with Panasonic clock radios and televisionsthan the company's personal computers.andP;  After successfully penetrating thedot matrix printer market, Panasonic has now set its sights on PCs, and the$1,149 CF-150B Business Partner is the first small step.andM;A quick glance at the Business Partner might lead you to mistake it for theTandy 1100 FD, and with good reason: Tandy manufactures the unit forPanasonic, but two major difference distinguish the Business Partner from itscounterpart.andP;  The Business Partner features a large backlit display that setit apart from most of the low-end floppy-only laptops, including Toshiba'sT1000 and the 1100 FD.andP;  The other difference is that Tandy includes itsDeskMate integrated software in ROM, while Panasonic only has DOS 3.3.andM;The backlit LCD is one of the Business Partner's major selling points.andP;  Thedisplay's actual viewing area measures a roomy 7.5 by 4.6 inches with CGAgraphics at 640- by 200-pixel resolution.andP;  Panasonic's screen features bluecharacters against a light green background.andP;  The unit's unusual color schemeproves to be quite legible and easy on the eyes.andM;With dimensions of 2.5 by 12 by 9.75 inches, the Business Partner isn't thesmallest laptop you can buy, but it nevertheless fits easily into yourbriefcase.andP;  Nor is Panasonic the lightest, weighing 7 pounds with a battery,a weight comparable with the Compaq LTE with its hard disk.andP;  An ACTtransormer adds another half pound.andM;Like the Tandy 1100 FD, Panasonic's Business Partner features a rechargeable6V, 1.8 AH lead acid battery.andP;  While the manufacturer claims a 4-hour batterylife, results on PC Labs Battery Rundown performance test were disappointing.andO;With the backlighting on, the battery lasted only 1 hour and 24 minutes, andneeded 10 hours to recharge fully.andP;  Since the unit shares the same powersupply as its nonbacklit and less power-consuming cousin, the poorperformance is not surprising.andP;  A more powerful battery would helpsignificantly.andM;Even though the keyboard has clearly visible decals on the keycaps, whichmight wear off, the Business Partner CF-150B's 84-key keyboard is a plusoverall.andP;  It is larger than most notebook-size portables' keyboards, and with12 function keys and an intelligent layout, it is comfortable to use.andM;The Panasonic Business Partner's expansion possibilities are severelylimited.andP;  The standard unit ships with 640K of RAM, and DOS 3.3 stored inROM.A 1MB upgrade is available and can be configured as extended memory or aRAM disk.andP;  An optional modem card resides in a dedicated slot at the rear ofthe unit, alongside the system's only 2 ports: a 9-pin serial port and aparallel port.andP;  The Panasonic Business Partner CF-150B's one 3.5-inch diskdrive accepts 720K floppy disks, and there is no external monitor support.andM;Panasonic can't match the Toshiba T1000's street price ($550) or the Tandy1100 FD's ROM-based software, and the Business Partner's battery needs abooster shot to drive the power-hungry LCD.andP;  But if you're looking for ano-frills laptop with a readable screen and a comfortable keyboard,Panasonic's Business Partner will run anything you can fit on adouble-density disk, 640K, and CGA.andM;BENCHMARKS TESTS: PANASONICandM;CF-150B BUSINESS PARTNERandM;The Panasonic CF-150B Business Partner features a NEC V20 CPU rated at 8 MHzwith performance nearly identical to its counterpart, the Tandy 1100 FD.andO;Battery performance is disappointing; Panasonic uses the same battery asTandy, but its backlit display draws significantly more power than thenonbacklit 1100 FD.andM;The 8088 Instruction Mix benchmark test times a series of tasks specific tothe 8088 chip.andP;  Since this test shows how the CPU operates in the context ofthe bus, processor, system memory, and motherboard architecture, a fastertime means better overall computer performance.andM;The Conventional Memory benchmark test measures the read/write speed of thefirst 640K of memory.andP;  Slower relative times can indicate the presence ofmemory wait states or memory chips rated at slower access speeds.andM;The Battery Rundown performance test involves teletyping five screens of textto the laptop computer's display, then writing a 15K file to the hard diskonce every minute until the battery runs out of power.andP;  All powerconservation technique are disabled.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
