The company last paid a dividend of 15 cents a share in December.    For 1986, the company earned $1.4 million, or 51 cents a share, down from $2.2 million, or 63 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales were down 3.3% to $113.6 million. For the fourth quarter, the company had a loss of $2.5 million, in contrast to earnings of $2 million, or 71 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales for the quarter were down 2.8% to $22.7 million.    The 1986 results included a gain of $2.8 million from a pension plan termination, which offset a $1.5 million loss from continuing operations.    The maker of engineered products for the railroad, construction equipment and materials handling industries said its 1986 earnings were hurt by results from its railway products and automated systems divisions. </TEXT></DOC>
