The dollar was down, too, butbond prices posted small gains.   The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 16.58 to 2855.45 inactive trading.

Investors worrythat IBM's first-quarter troubles will be shared by manyother companies as the economy remains mired in a recession.Several market averages jumped to record levels early thisyear on expectations that the recession would end in thesecond quarter.   But now, that scenario seems much less likely. Yesterday'snews only contributed to worries that the economy is still indecline. The Labor Department reported that initial claimsfor state unemployment insurance rose 45,000 to 519,000 inthe week ended March 9.   Analysts said investors clearly are taking a moredefensive posture, moving out of shares of so-called cyclicalcompaniesthose whose fortunes depend heavily on the ups anddowns of the economic cycle -- and into defensive issues suchas pharmaceuticals and beverage companies. If the economycontinues to erode, the analysts said, they expect investorsto begin taking money out of the stock market and putting itelsewhere, especially into bonds.   Bonds rallied slightly on the unemployment data, whichwere viewed as reducing inflationary pressures in theeconomy. But profit-taking cost the bond market most of itsearly gain.   Bond traders said it will be difficult to sustain anotherrally in bonds as long as investors fear that the FederalReserve won't cut interest rates further. Recent data haveshown a disconcerting rise in both wholesale and consumerprices, although some analysts said changes in the way theLabor Department compiles the data may have caused the risein consumer prices last month to be overstated.   In the currency market, traders said the dollar's slippagewas a natural reaction to its recent strong gains. Thecurrency was sold heavily by some European central banksyesterday. But some traders said it isn't clear whether thedollar is merely undergoing a brief correction or isreflecting deeper worries about a U.S. economic recovery.   In major market action:                                                                                                          Stock prices tumbled in active trading. Volume on the NewYork Stock Exchange totaled 199.8 million shares. Butadvancing issues on the Big Board were ahead of losers,818-749.                                                                                                          Bond prices rose slightly.
