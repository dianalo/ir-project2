Releasing its first data on the nation's inflation,spending and production since Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion ofKuwait, the government said producer prices soared 1.3% inAugust, while retail sales dropped 0.6% and industrial outputslipped 0.2%.</LP><TEXT>   The figures bore out the fears of many analysts that thesurge in oil prices brought on by the Persian Gulf turmoilwould threaten the already weak economy by pinchingAmericans' purchasing power and piling a new burden onbusinesses.   An increasing number of economists now believe a recessionin the near future is inescapable. &quot;Look at what happened inAugust: employment declined, consumer spending declined,industrial production declined,&quot; said Donald Ratajczak,director of the economic forecasting project at Georgia StateUniversity. &quot;At some point when it looks and smells and actslike a duck, then what is it?&quot;   The jump in the Labor Department's producer price index,which measures the prices factories, farmers and otherproducers receive for goods, was fueled mostly by energyprices, which catapulted 9.6% during the month. But evenexcluding energy the index rose a substantial 0.5%, amountingto a 6% annual rate.   Gasoline prices leaped 16.9% while prices of home heatingoil soared 38.8%. Crude petroleum prices skyrocketed 62.5%,the largest monthly increase ever recorded. That pushed up anindex measuring prices of unfinished goods a startling 9.3%in August, the steepest rise since August 1973, when thegovernment ended a price freeze.   Many economists believe the problems of inflation stemmingfrom the oil crisis are only beginning.   &quot;We know the inflation effect isn't over,&quot; said JamesAnnable, chief economist at First National Bank of Chicago,predicting that it will take three or four months before thejump in crude oil prices works its way through to the gaspump, heating bill and other consumer energy costs. &quot;So therest of the year is going to be dominated by the oil priceincrease and feeding through to other products.&quot;   Already, Mr. Ratajczak noted, makers of petroleum-basedchemical products have announced increases in the prices oftheir products. Nevertheless, he and other analysts predictedthat many businesses will have a hard time passing higherenergy costs on to their customers, given the weak economy.   Airlines are already finding that out. Many postponedplans to raise fares to cover huge rises in their fuel billsin the face of softening consumer demand.   The drop in retail sales came despite a huge 6.4% rise inthe amount of money taken in by gasoline stations during themonth. While higher gasoline prices pushed up sales totals atfilling stations, business for most other types of merchantsdeclined. Sales of car dealers plummeted 4.3%.Department-store sales slipped 0.2%. Hardware andbuilding-supply stores dropped 2.4%. Restaurant sales fell0.7%. Sales of furniture stores increased, however, climbing0.7%.   &quot;American consumers cut back sharply in August as theirconfidence about economic conditions plunged,&quot; said DonaldStraszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. in NewYork.   The drop in industrial production last month reflectedsmall declines in the output of a wide array of industries,including cars, computers and clothing. As a result, theoperating rates of factories, mines and utilities fell to83.1% of capacity in August from 83.5% in July.   The string of reports highlight the difficulty confrontingthe Federal Reserve. The central bank is under pressure tolower interest rates to jump-start the ailing economy. Butofficials are wary of allowing rates to fall while inflationremains a problem.   Few analysts expect inflation to spiral out of control asit did following the oil shock of the late 1970s. Globalcompetition is likely to force companies to keep a firm gripon prices and wages, Mr. Annable predicted.   Still, the oil price jolt &quot;probably but not certainly willpush the economy over the edge into a mild recession,&quot; saidCharles Schultze, an economist at the Brookings Institutionin Washington who was chairman of the White House Council ofEconomic Advisers during the Carter administration.
