By setting personal tax rates below corporate rates, the 1986 tax act spurred small corporations to adopt S status in order to be taxed like partnerships. The act also required S concerns to use the calendar year.    But the 1987 tax act lets them keep fiscal years if they make certain tax &quot;deposits.&quot; This new law creates an unexpected onetime tax break for the many fiscal-year concerns that opted late in 1986 to convert to S status in 1987, says Sheldon M. Bonovitz, a Philadelphia tax lawyer.    By retaining a fiscal year for now, a concern moves some income that would be taxed in 1987 at 38.5%, the top personal rate, into 1988, when it is taxed at 28% or 33%. Bonovitz gives an example: An S concern keeps a June 30 year in 1988, loses 10% interest by making a required deposit, and has owners taxed at 28%; after June 30, it shifts to the calendar year from then on.    For each $100,000 earned in 1987 but taxed in 1988, Bonovitz says, the net tax saving is $9,600.    AT LEAST THIS PROFILE is based on the Michigan tax cheat's good side.    After studying a 10% sample of personal returns filed in 1986's state amnesty, Michigan's treasury says a typical cheat was a single man; was self-employed, a manager or in sales; and showed income of $56,000. He filed an average of 1.5 delinquent returns and paid $665 in state tax and $108 in interest. This excludes evaders who didn't step forward, of course; but 15.6% of the filers previously were &quot;unknown to the voluntary compliance system.&quot;    Besides the amnesty total of $109.8 million, the state treasury says, it has collected $116.3 million more with new &quot;enhanced enforcement&quot; programs. Fiscal-1987 collections were $70 million above fiscal 1985's. The agency says a new division that uses computerized document-matching to spot evaders and non-filers has detected $19.6 million in its first 13 months.    A LOST WEEK ends his chance to deduct an $18,000 payment to his ex-wife.    The 1984 tax act altered the taxation of divorce-related property transfers between former spouses. In transfers after July 18, 1984, no one has a gain or loss; a property's cost basis doesn't change. Prior law imputed any gain to a transferor and set a new basis at current market value. Divorced in 1983, Michael J. Godlewski of Lilburn, Ga., paid his ex-wife $18,000 in 1984 for title to their home and then sold it for $64,000. He figured his gain after adding $18,000 to the house's cost of $32,200.    But the IRS demurred, arguing that the 1984 law governed the deal; the title transfer followed the vital date. Godlewski claimed that prior law applied, for the agreement was reached before July 18; his ex-wife signed the pact on July 13. But he didn't sign it until July 25 -- a fatal week after the new law took effect. Tax Court Special Judge Pate found no evidence that an agreement existed before July 25.    The judge held that Godlewski's basis was $32,200, raising his taxable gain on the sale by $18,000.    IRS OMBUDSMEN now have power to order relief for taxpayers beset by IRS errors or red tape, Commissioner Gibbs says; before, the agents could only urge IRS offices to clear up messes they made. Taxpayers who can't settle problems through normal channels may call IRS problem resolution offices listed in phone books.    DO TAXES ON THE CUFF mean they'll take the shirt off your back? In a one-year trial, affluent Westport, Conn., is letting residents charge real-estate, business and other local taxes to Visa or MasterCards. Tax Collector Richard Russell says the plan is a convenience and avoids bad checks.    A B+ FOR EFFORT and courtesy in a tough situation goes to the IRS phone folks from tax Prof. Philip Storrer of California State University, Hayward. After posing return questions in 50 calls to 11 locations, he says 84% of the answers were at least partly right, as taxpayer-aid personnel &quot;worked hard&quot; to be accurate.    DEFERRING PAY through a taxable trust looks like a good deal these days.    Now that the top corporate tax rate exceeds the top personal rate, many employers are considering a form of &quot;golden handcuff&quot; that defers executive pay for a specified period without troubling to abide by the rules for deferring tax. For reasons too involved to give here, you'll hear the plan called a &quot;secular trust.&quot; A company contributes to an employee's trust. The money belongs to the employee, who reports annual taxable income on both company contributions and earnings distributed from the trust.    But a company can afford to give an executive extra money to pay tax on its contributions, says Warren Shine of Ernst andamp; Whinney, CPAs. This is because a company deducts the cost at the corporate rate but pays an employee's taxes at the lower personal rate. And by paying out earnings to the executive, the trust provides cash to pay the tax on the earnings. Eventually, when the trust terms release the principal, the executive receives it free of further tax.    Thus, the executive avoids the threat of future rate increases, Shine notes.
