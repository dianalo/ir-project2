No people had been killed, but a half-dozen homes and a firetruck were destroyed and a dozen head of cattle were killed.   The state forestry service issued the alert until rain _ whichthe National Weather Service isn't expecting for days _ raisesmoisture levels.   ``It is obvious that the danger is high when we are having firesfrom the Louisiana border to the Big Bend country, and north intothe Panhandle area,'' said Bruce Miles, director of the Texas ForestService.   ``March, with its traditional high winds and low humidities andcured fuels, is always our potentially most hazardous fire period ofthe year,'' he said.   As of Monday, the major fires had burned:   _1,000 acres on the Camp Swift military reservation, 40 mileseast of Austin, used by military reserve units. Foam-pumpers andU.S. Forest Service bulldozers had the fire under control aroundnoon Monday.   _600 acres in the Hill Country, and destroyed one home and thepossessions of a family of four and damaged four other homesSaturday.   _38,000 acres in Dickens County in the lower Panhandle beforebeing put out Monday around daybreak.   _615 acres, reduced from Sunday's estimate of 1,200 acres, in theHigh Chisos Mountains in the worst fire in Big Bend National Park'shistory. Crews were beginning to bring it under control Monday.   In addition, 151 fires burned more than 3,500 acres in the pinewoods of southeastern Texas, the latest day for which that figurewas available, the forestry service said.   In the Dickens County fire, about 60 miles east of Lubbock, sixfamilies were evacuated and a fire truck from the Spur FireDepartment was destroyed. One home burned and about a dozen head ofcattle were killed, said Sandra Taylor, a Dickens County sheriff'soffice dispatcher.   Officials said the cause of the blaze was not known.   A 150-acre fire about nine miles southeast of Kerrvilleapparently began when residents were doing open burning and ``withthe gust of wind and dryness of the grass, it just got away fromthem,'' said Arthur Verona, assistant emergency managementcoordinator for Kerrville and Kerr County.   The flames gutted one mobile home, two storage sheds and a barn,and damaged five other mobile homes, Verona said.</TEXT></DOC>
