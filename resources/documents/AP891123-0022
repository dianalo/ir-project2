Nader called the bipartisan leadership agreement that allowedthe rapid passage of the pay raise a ``two-party cabal'' that used``dictatorial procedural practices.''   Nader wants to persuade Congress to reverse itself on the payraise when it meets next year, or barring that, to generateopposition to members of Congress who supported the raise and facere-election next year.   Members of Congress, Nader said, already receive an adequatesalary, a lavish pension and other benefits, and are in the top 1percent of all Americans in pay.   He disputed the notion that paying more would attract morequalified people to government.   ``All it does is increases their greed,'' Nader said.   He said he also wanted a constitutional amendment to limitmembers of Congress to 12 years in office, saying it would reducethe power of legislative leaders who pushed the pay raise.   House salaries will increase from $89,500 to about $125,000 by1991, while members will be barred from collecting pay forspeeches. Senate salaries would rise to about $100,000, butsenators may still take money for speeches.</TEXT></DOC>
