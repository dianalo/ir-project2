Both Mitsotakis's New Democracy Party and the communist-dominatedleftist alliance, who together won nearly 60 percent of Sunday'svote, say a new government first must punish those responsible forthe scandals of the defeated socialist administration of PremierAndreas Papandreou.   But the alliance of the pro-Soviet Greek Communist Party and theGreek Left Party, which finished third, turned down Mitsotakis'offer to join in an interim government that would investigate thecorruption.   The alliance also refuses to cooperate with Papandreou, makingthe possibility of new elections likely and paralyzing Parliament,which cannot order an inquiry if the political parties cannot form agovernment.   Mitsotakis said Papandreou cannot keep making national decisionsand demanded the replacement within 24 hours of officials appointedby Papandreou, including the governors of Greece's 56 provinces, theheads of state organizations, including radio and television, andthe secret service.   ``I can assure you there will be catharsis,'' Mitsotakis told anews conference after President Christos Sartzetakis gave him themandate to form a government.   ``A solution has to be found as soon as possible, to allowparliament to investigate the scandals and to initiateprosecutions,'' he added.   Mitsotakis, who finished first with 44.29 percent of the vote and144 of parliament's 300 seats, did not indicate how he mightovercome the leftists' refusal to join him in a coalition.   If Mitsotakis fails to form a government within three days, thepresident will ask Papandreou and the leftist alliance in turn totry.   Mitsotakis clarified his coalition offer would only last a fewmonths and would focus on investigating and prosecuting corruption.   Following that, ``then we will go to new elections which willprovide the political solution, which these elections did not,''Mitsotakis added.   Under the constitution, Papandreou continues as caretaker premieruntil there is a new government, or new elections are held.   Mitsotakis said he told the president that Papandreou could notcontinue handling matters of national interest since the socialistswere defeated.   With 98 percent of the votes counted, the leftist-communistcoalition has emerged as a kingmaker with 13.5 percent of the votegiving it 31 seats in the parliament.   New Democracy won 44.29 percent, giving it 144 seats, seven shortof a majority, and Papandreou's Panehellenic Socialist Movement39.18 percent, giving it 125 seats.   The communists said they are ready to cooperate with Papandreou'sparty, but only if Papandreou and all other party members theymaintain are involved in the scandals are excluded.   Papandreou and senior members of his party have been accused bythe opposition of being involved in a multimillion-dollar scandal byfugitive banker George Koskotas, the owner of the Bank of Crete.Koskotas is in prison in the United States awaiting the hearing ofan extradition demand by the Greek government.   Mitsotakis and the communist alliance maintain the electionresult was a clear mandate for an investigation of the scandals.   But Papandreou said Tuesday that ``the Greek people gave themajority to the democratic-progressive forces and excluded thereturn of the right and conservatism to power.''   ``These forces have the obligation to govern the state. This isthe clear and indisputable mandate of the Greek people,'' he added,in what was interpreted as yet another indirect appeal to thecommunist alliance to join forces with his party.</TEXT></DOC>
