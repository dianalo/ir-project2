Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> IBM </CO><IN> EDP </IN><TEXT>   International Business Machines Corp. took a big step to upgrade products in the burgeoning market for software that sorts and keeps track of data in a computer.    IBM faces acute competition in this market from a cluster of smaller California software companies that have embraced an imaginative new technology that makes it easier to find data inside a vast ocean of computer memory. The technology, known as &quot;relational database management,&quot; was conceived at IBM in the 1970s, but IBM has been slower to exploit it than the California upstarts.    IBM is seeking to blunt the upstarts' widely perceived technology edge with a new version of its flagship database product for mainframe computers, DB2. But the new version, unveiled yesterday, won't be available until the third quarter of 1989, giving the smaller rivals plenty of time to match Big Blue.    &quot;IBM is narrowing the gap, but not eliminating the gap,&quot; said Stephen Cohen, a computer analyst at SoundView Financial Group, Stamford, Conn. &quot;I expect that by the third quarter of '89, the IBM product will have been leapfrogged.&quot;    IBM and its competitors are working toward the day when office workers can sit at any kind of computer -- personal computers, minicomputers, or mainframes -- and pull together data scattered throughout a corporation's far-flung computers. But that day is still several years away. Among the technological hurdles: preserving the integrity and security of data in such a network.    Yesterday's announcement brought that day closer for IBM. It said its new version of DB2 will let users handle data stored in different mainframe computers, as opposed to just one. The company, based in Armonk, N.Y., said it eventually plans to extend DB2's reach all the way down to personal computers, though it didn't specify a date for that goal.    At the heart of IBM's database strategy is the relational technology it spawned a decade ago. Relational databases let users find data even if they don't know the precise location and format in which the data were originally stored. Products, like the new DB2, that draw on several machines are called &quot;distributed relational databases.&quot;    The California rivals first applied this technology to smaller machines, but have also been taking aim at mainframe computers, the hubs of information-processing inside all big corporations and governments. The leading members of this group include Oracle Corp., Informix Software Inc., and Relational Technology Inc.    They are starting to be considered bigger threats to IBM's DB2 than traditional mainframe software companies -- such as Cullinet Software Inc. -- that aren't so far advanced with relational programs.    The smaller relational-database companies compete with IBM by arguing that their products run on many different makers' machines. &quot;The problem IBM will face is that they'll be confined to IBM's equipment,&quot; Robert Healy, Relational Technology's marketing vice president said yesterday. &quot;Most shops have multiple vendors, and somebody's got to tie all those together.&quot;    At stake for IBM is its position in a market that is growing in size and strategic importance. Market researcher Gartner Group Inc. estimated DB2 will bring IBM about $200 million in revenue this year, and said that figure is rising 20% to 30% a year -- far faster than IBM's overall revenue. Moreover, selling database software also helps IBM fight its mainframe computer rivals. IBM can argue that its computers are better suited to run its crucial database programs. </TEXT></DOC>
