The broadcasting, financial services and power generationconcern also said directors voted to exempt Westinghouse fromthe protection of Pennsylvania's anti-takeover law that wentinto effect on April 27.

Terms weren't disclosed. Rosemount is a unit ofEmerson Electric Co., of St. Louis, Mo., a maker ofmeasurement, control, analytical and valve products.   Westinghouse also said it is part of a consortium that wasawarded a $358 million contract to build a coal-fired powergenerating unit for Old Dominion Electric Cooperative andVirgina Power. Other members of the consortium are CombustionEngineering Inc., H.B. Zachry Co. and Black andamp; VeatchEngineers-Architects.

Westinghouse stock rose $1.375 to close at $38.375 incomposite trading on the New York Stock Exchange.   Analysts who follow the company said the announcedbuy-back of more than $700 million of stock all but endsspeculation that Westinghouse might want to launch a bid forSundstrand Corp., an aerospace-parts concern based inRockford, Ill.   Westinghouse's top officials have declined to commentspecifically on the Sundstrand rumor. But in a story in thisnewspaper earlier this week, the officials cast doubt onwhether Westinghouse would undertake a more than $2 billionacquisition that would dilute earnings.   Sundstrand on Wednesday tumbled $4.25. Yesterday the stockclosed at $74, down 12.5 cents in composite trading on theNew York Stock Exchange.   Westinghouse said it considers its stock an attractiveinvestment. Initial funding for the buy-back will come fromexisting cash, internally generated funds or through theissuance of short-term debt.

The plant will process as many as 600 tons of municipalsolid waste daily to fuel a 20-megawatt power plant.
