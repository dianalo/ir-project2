 Its first shot was the 4019, a 10-ppm competitor for the LaserJetSeries II, based on a new print engine developed and manufactured by IBM (seeVol.andP;  4, No.andP;  2, for our first impressions).andP;  Now, IBM has lowered the priceof the 4019 to $2,395 (to match the price of the new LaserJet Series IIImachines), introduced a $1,495 5-ppm version of the machine to compete withthe 4-ppm LaserJet IIP, and released a $499 PostScript option for bothmachines.andM;LaserPrinter E.andP;  Aside from one or two minor ergonomic improvements, theLaserPrinter E is identical to its older brother in every way except speed.andO;According to IBM, the LaserPrinter E's circuitry has been slowed down toobtain the 5-ppm speed; otherwise it's a 10-ppm LaserPrinter in every otherrespect, including the options supported.andP;  Both machines mark at 300 dpi.andM;The 10-ppm LaserPrinter has a claimed duty cycle of 20,000 pages per month,while the E is rated at 12,000 pages per month.andP;  But this is only because IBMdoubts that users could run more than 12,000 pages off a 5-ppm printer in asingle month.andM;The print engine, entirely made by IBM, uses a single-piece cartridge thatwas made possible by a cross-licensing agreement with Canon.andP;  Both machinesoffer IBM extended ASCII (called Personal Printer Data Stream, or PDDS),HP-GCL, and HP LaserJet (PCL 4) emulation--and now PostScript--as well as 48optional credit card-sized font cartridges and 12 downloadable collections.andM;A Model E can be upgraded to a 10-ppm machine for $1,099, which involves alogic board swap.andM;In response to the fuss HP is making over the resolution enhancement mode inthe LaserJet Series III (see our first look at the machine in the last issueof this publication), IBM will be promoting a hitherto ignored feature thatallows a user to switch printers between two exposure modes: the default ModeA, which is optimized for solid blacks, and Mode B, which appears to use aslightly smaller spot size for sharper type (at the expense of solid blackareas).andP;  Mode B does appear to improve type quality.andM;(By the by, we have run preliminary tests of resolution-enhanced PostScriptoutput on the LaserJet Series III with PostScript files that have beenrasterized on a PC using QMS's UltraScript.andP;  Our initial tests suggest thatresolution enhancement will make an even bigger difference on PostScriptoutput on the III than it did on PCL 5 output.)andM;PostScript.andP;  The LaserPrinter's PostScript option provides Adobe PostScriptversion 52 with 17 resident outline fonts for $499.andP;  In addition, at leastone megabyte of memory has to be added to the standard 512k, which isavailable for $449.andP;  In addition, 2-and 3.5-MB memory upgrades are availablefor $899 and $1,599 respectively.andM;IBM is also offering a &quot;Premium PostScript&quot; option, which adds a font cardwith 22 more font outlines, for a total of 39 resident fonts.andP;  The PremiumPostScript Option lists for $899.andP;  Alternatively, the font card can bepurchased separately for $699.andM;A 1.5-MB PostScript LaserPrinter lists for $3,743, whereas the 5-ppm Model Ecosts $2,743--prices that compare favorably with the TI MicroLaser and HP'sIIP and III when configured for PostScript.andP;  Street discounts should drivethe price down even more, undoubtedly bringing the E in under $2,000 fromsome discounters.andM;But weighed against this affordability is the fact that the LaserPrinterseries only comes with a parallel port, with a serial option that consists ofa parallel-to-serial dongle--not the height of configurable flexibility.andP;  AndIBM indicates it has &quot;no current plans&quot; to offer LocalTalk support, whichwould make it a plug-and-play item for the Macintosh crowd.andM;We believe IBM is making a serious mistake by not offering this as aMacintosh PostScript printer.andP;  Mac users are quite willing to forego Applebrand loyalty if they can achieve similar or better performance at asignificantly lower price--especially since many Macs are installed in mixedMac/PC environments.andM;Installation.andP;  Installing the PostScript option involves popping open thepanel on the right side (which on the E conveniently swings down on a hinge;on the LaserPrinter you have to slide it off its catches, which can be trickyin tight places); removing the existing half-megabyte memory board (anotherhalf-meg is on the controller board); and prying out the four existing PROMs.andO;The PostScript module is a circuit board with two sets of pin connectors thatfit into two of the existing PROM sockets on the motherboard.andP;  The 1-MBmemory module then fits over the PostScript module.andP;  The original half-megadd-on module is then discarded, which seems wasteful to us even thoughmemory prices have dropped.andM;Although end users can purchase it, IBM expects that most will elect to havea dealer install PostScript for them.andP;  We recommend that you do so.andP;  Althoughwe didn't have any trouble installing the PostScript option, there areseveral ways you can go wrong, not the least being bending or breaking one ofthe pins on the option board module.andP;  Moreover, we did have a small accidentwhen we attempting to reinstall the original PROMs.andP;  We plugged them inbackwards, then fried them when we applied power.andM;Trials and tribulations.andP;  We have had the original LaserPrinter in our shopfor half a year now.andP;  During that time we have used it as a volume networkprinter on our experimental 3 + Open Lan Manager server.andP;  In practice, thenative IBM ASCII hasn't proved very useful, despite its impressivesoftware-configurable capabilities, where envelope feeders and second sheettrays can be selected from within your application's data stream.andP;  Theproblem was that we had no applications that supported these modes.andP;  TheLaserJet emulation was serviceable, but no better than the LaserJet itself.andM;Moreover, the LaserPrinter's front panel has driven us crazy for some time.andO;For some unfathomable reason IBM eschewed the use of an LCD display in favorof a single-digit LED and a dozen LED &quot;lights.&quot;andP;  By holding down variouscombinations of the Code, Font, Paper and Orientation keys, you selectoptions ranging from operating mode to default paper bin.andM;The problem is that you can easily get confused: we once spent two hourstrying to download IBM ASCII-mode fonts to the machine only to discover thatit had been configured for HP emulation.andP;  Adding PostScript simply meansadding a set of new button and light combinations that have to be remembered.andM;With the E printer, IBM has added a cheat sheet on the top cover.andP;  We are notamused, however, and fervently hope IBM will see the light, swallow somepride, and adopt an HP/Canon-style LCD display.andP;  (TI's MicroLaser has onetoo.)andM;Still, we might have forgiven these shortcomings if we could have placed theprinter on one of our 3Com network servers, which could then be accessed fromthe Macs using 3Com's 3 + Print facility.andP;  When we tried to set this up weencountered a frustrating problem--which we now realize has implications thatgo far beyond IBM's LaserPrinter, although (so far) it is the worst offender.andM;Apparently the PostScript implementation in the LaserPrinter neveranticipated that a Macintosh user might get access to it.andP;  To print a Macapplication's PostScript output, an appropriate dictionary (called LWPREP)has to be downloaded to the printer to act as a translator, as it were,between Apple-specific characteristics and the more generic PostScriptinterpreter.andP;  Because 3Com bypasses the normal Mac printing protocols, ithandles the downloading of a LWPREP file to the printer when Mac printing isinitialized.andM;Evidently Apple's printers have been developed with the notion that thesedictionaries exist and will change from time to time.andP;  Certainly we havenever had a problem with a LaserWriter we hooked up to a serial line on a3Com server, nor for that matter with the GCC Business Laser Printer or evena LaserJet IIP with a Pacific Data Products PacificPage PostScript clonecartridge (which uses Phoenix's PhoenixPage).andM;No way, Jose.andP;  But not the IBM LaserPrinter.andP;  When we tried to download theLWPREP file to initialize it, it choked.andP;  We tried two LWPREP files of morerecent vintage that 3Com ships with 3 + Open, with the same results.andO;Apparently, there is no way you can print to the LaserPrinter from aMacintosh--at least on a 3Com 3 + system.andP;  And we suspect we will obtainsimilar results when we hook it up to our 3 + Open and Netware servers, bothof which use Apple's AFP protocols for printing and file sharing.andM;Experimenting, we found we can't print to the TI MicroLaser when it isconnected to a 3Com server over serial lines, but can print to it overLocalTalk.andP;  The IIP's PacificPage won't accept the two more recent vintageLWPREP files, even though it digests the earlier version just fine.andO;Genicom's 6152 PostScript clone machine also won't process the more recentLWPREP files; indeed, Genicom had custom tuned its GeniScript clone when itencountered problems with our original LWPREP file initially.andP;  Will it haveto provide a custom implementation for every LWPREP version?andM;The bottom line: forget about using the IBM LaserPrinter as a network printerin a mixed Mac and PC network for now.andP;  Moreover, you may have to take careto match the right LWPREP with any PostScript implementation newer than the49.2 in the GCC machine.andP;  (We wonder what will happen when we try out the newHP PostScript cartridge, which is based on the latest and greatest Adobeimplementation.)andM;To a large extent these problems are indicative of how little most of theindustry understands the requirements of network printer sharing in aheterogeneous environment.andP;  But at the same time they could well serve as aharbinger of darker days ahead, when we have two or more leading PostScriptimplementations for which we must mix and match fonts--and now LWPREPversions.andP;  The implications are depressing indeed.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
