Moscow's reply was an embarrassing &quot;nyet.&quot;    It was one of a number of signals the Soviet bloc has sent lately to show displeasure with Sandinista economic mismanagement. The Soviets reportedly wonder why Nicaragua, a country with no oil fields and 800% inflation, charges only 10 cents a gallon at the pump. So Nicaraguan officials are traveling to Iran, Algeria, Libya, Mexico, Venezuela, Peru and soon to Indonesia in search of non-Soviet oil. They must go cup in hand -- there isn't any foreign exchange to pay for the crude -- and so far they've come up with little.    Nicaragua's economic crisis, which is the Sandinista Achilles' heel, is exacerbated by Managua's incompetence and international isolation as much as by the Contra war. Prospects, even if the Contras are defeated, are gloomy.    &quot;Our geopolitical position will always work against us,&quot; comments Francisco Lopez, director of the Nicaraguan Institute of Economic and Social Investigations, a pro-Sandinista think tank. &quot;Even if we resolve this war and find real peace, the economic problem will be of tremendous importance over the long term.&quot;    Nicaragua's primary ally, Cuba, has been able to manage for more than a quarter century, despite a U.S. embargo, because of massive Soviet bloc aid -- but its economy is still stagnant even without an insurgency to fight.    There isn't any sign that efficiency-minded Mikhail Gorbachev is ready to make the same kind of economic commitment to Sandinista Nicaragua, where the mixed socialist-capitalist economy is tottering under the weight of counterproductive government pricing policies and an overbearing bureaucracy. Meanwhile, economic assistance to Nicaragua from Western Europe and Latin America, which spurred impressive growth in the first years of the revolution, has fallen steadily since 1982.    Publicly, Sandinista leaders blame the Contras and the U.S. trade embargo for their economic woes, which include an unpayable foreign debt (to the East and West) of about $10 billion, an import-to-export ratio of nearly 4 to 1, plummeting agricultural and industrial productivity, and a nearly valueless currency. The Sandinistas claim direct and indirect economic damage by the Contras amounts to $2.8 billion over the past five years.    The Contras have attacked farm cooperatives, electric power lines, and a variety of state projects. And the growth of the army has robbed the economy of manpower and strained the government budget.    But Nicaragua gets all its weaponry for free, and the Soviet bloc even donates rice and corn to the Sandinista military. The Contras haven't touched Nicaragua's major cities, where the major markets and industrial plants lie. Contra efforts to cut road transport have been largely ineffective. For most of the past five years, the Contras have spent more time in their Honduran base camps than in Nicaragua.    And the trade embargo, so far, is a flop -- though it may be made more effective if hard-liners in the Reagan administration get their way. Many U.S. corporations still do business here (International Business Machines Corp. even services Sandinista computers); they slip through the embargo by importing spare parts and other supplies from overseas subsidiaries. Western sources here estimate the embargo caused a mere $30 million in damages from its inception in May 1985 through 1986.    &quot;If I were President Reagan,&quot; says Mario Jose Alegria, a private-sector economist, &quot;I'd eliminate the Contras because the Sandinistas don't have the capacity to govern a country at peace.&quot; He adds: &quot;The economic collapse won't come from the war, but from the government's administration and direction of the economy.&quot;    To be sure, better world coffee, cotton and sugar prices would help the economy. And Sandinista pragmatists led by President Daniel Ortega and Vice President Sergio Ramirez are trying to change the more irrational policies. But market absurdities remain: It costs more to import the fertilizer to grow a bushel of bananas than the price that bushel fetches in Managua. It costs less to import a Soviet tractor on credit (which Nicaragua can't pay anyway) than to fix one that is broken. A college professor can make a better living selling car parts on the black market than teaching class.    &quot;We must be realistic. Undoubtedly, we don't have an ideal price structure,&quot; concedes Industry Minister Emilio Baltodano. The Sandinista cabinet minister adds, &quot;We must improve relations with the U.S. The U.S. has to be our best market. That's fundamental for us to recuperate economically.&quot; That also isn't likely soon. </TEXT></DOC>
