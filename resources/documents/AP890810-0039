A spokesman for Orion Pictures did not return a phonecall seeking reaction.   The ``Golden Girls'' was recognized for the ``constant barrageof negative Italian and Sicilian diatribes'' spoken by the Italiancharacter Sofia Petrillo.``Golden Girls'' media representativeMerry Aronson had no comment on the charge.   Filmmaker Spike Lee's ``Do The Right Thing'' received a specialPlatinum Pit Award for ``advocating violence as a way to resolveconflict'' _ an oft-leveled charge the filmmaker has repeatedlydisputed.

The agency, monitored in Nicosia, quoted the English-languageTehran Times as saying in an editorial the talks would be conductedthrough a third country, probably Pakistan.   ``Political observers believed that in the next few days weshould expect certain moves towards mediation, of courseunofficially,'' IRNA quoted the editorial as saying.   It predicted the mediator would be Pakistan's foreign minister,Sahabzada Yaqub Khan, because both Iran and the United States havegood relations with Pakistan. No other details were given.   The newspaper, which is close to Iran's President-elect HashemiRafsanjani, also quoted an aide as expressing surprise that theUnited States had rejected a proposal that $2 billion in frozenIranian assets in U.S. banks be returned in exchange for Tehran'shelp in freeing American hostages in Lebanon.   Rafsanjani is considered a pragmatist who is anxious to rebuildties with the West in order to secure funds and technology to helpboost the flagging economy.   But the leading hard-liner in the hierarchy, Interior MinisterAli Akbar Mohtashemi, has shown his opposition to any softening ofIran's position on the hostages, urging Shiite militants to remainpoised to strike against the United States.   The 16 Western hostages are believed held by Shiite Moslemextremist groups under the umbrella of the pro-Iranian Hezbollah,or Party of God.   The unnamed aide was quoted as saying Iran was reacting to areport that President Bush had offered to release the Iranianassets, frozen after militants seized the American Embassy inTehran in 1979, in return for the hostages' freedom.   ``It's really strange. First the U.S. offers anassets-for-hostages deal and then the spokesman of the White Housesays that his country is not ready to pay ransom,'' he was quotedas saying.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said Monday that theUnited was not willing to link the Iranian assets to the hostagesissue.   The Tehran Times editorial quoted Rafsanjani's aide as adding:``What Iran meant was that the move to unfreeze the Iranian assetswould have been taken in Iran as a goodwill gesture on behalf ofthe U.S.   ``It's a clear policy of the Islamic republic not to pay orreceive ransom. ... What Iran has said more than once is thatTehran is ready to cooperate... on humanitarian grounds.''   Bush told reporters Wednesday he was willing ``to talk and toexercise every diplomatic channel I can'' to free the Americancaptives but ruled out ``trading'' for hostages.</TEXT></DOC>
