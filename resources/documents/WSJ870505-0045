No fever or delirium was involved. The jungle can't be blamed, nor the sweltering heat, nor the Rajang River winding deeper and deeper into Borneo.    No. What brought this quest to its knees was the late 20th century. Spend a week in darkest Borneo searching for the edge of civilization and what you find these days are computers and jogging shoes, blue jeans and the latest episode of &quot;L.A. Law.&quot; Where is Kurtz when you need him for a story?    Go deeper, was the advice. We went deeper. An hour by boat from this tiny river port and five hours by truck over slick mountain trails gets us to three primitive huts occupied by heavily tattooed Iban natives who cut trees for a logging company. Except for the pack of Dunhills that one of the Ibans offers, the 20th century seems distant.    Until a phone rings. The caller is in a motel room in Anaheim, Calif. He is the logging company's local manager, and he is phoning via satellites and hilltop relay towers to say that his Disneyland vacation is going great. He dialed the jungle direct.    You would think that the search for civilization's edge would be easy on an island like Borneo, a France-sized redoubt of rain forests, rivers and rhinoceros beetles the size of toy Volkswagens. Alas, these days a pilgrimage up three rivers into the heart of Sarawak, Malaysia's largest and least developed state, can't get you beyond TV antennas and T-shirts that proclaim &quot;California Kid&quot; and &quot;Check Me Out&quot; and &quot;Northern Michigan University.&quot;    It is a trifle disconcerting to arrive at a village market six hours by longboat from the coast only to find that Australian apples, Chinese pears and Sunkist oranges got there first; and to travel another two hours to an Iban longhouse -- a motel-like structure on stilts -- and find that politicians had popped in by helicopter the day before to festoon the place with party banners; and to watch, at a tiny river port, the unloading of boxes that contain frozen chicken wings &quot;Made in the U.S.A.&quot;    The latest modern infestation is mobile phones -- a blessing for Sarawak politicians whose constituencies are often far beyond telephone poles. But mudslinging on the move has its drawbacks.    Campaigning for a state legislature seat last month, one candidate had to stop a speech to answer his briefcase phone. &quot;Call me back,&quot; he told the reporter on the other end. Another candidate answered his phone on a longboat heading up-river. But he couldn't hear the reporter's questions because the boat's engine was making too much noise. It's a real political jungle out there.    The beginning of the journey was promising enough. Never mind the arrival by jet at Kuching, the state capital. River boats remain Borneo's preferred means of transport. In most places, there is no choice because there are no roads or airports. So we hop a water taxi down the Sarawak River, then a tired old longboat back upstream -- a sort of mood-setting exercise for the exotica to come.    Matted green clumps of jungle glide by as the boat's diesel groans against the river's stiff current. Around one bend, two fishermen in flimsy canoes heave nets into the coffee-colored water. Rickety wooden docks poke out from thick riverbank foliage that shades tin-roofed houses.    Suddenly the clouds burst in a tropical downpour, sending the lone passenger and the boatman's dog scurrying for shelter amid banana stalks, empty beer bottles and gasoline drums under the boat's leaky wooden canopy. Attempts in three languages to evoke Conrad and Maugham elicit only tolerant nods from the boatman. But he produces a dog-eared pamphlet warning that &quot;unforgettable exotic sights and sounds await you in the land of the historic headhunters and white rajahs.&quot;    Sure enough, around the next bend stands what for Sarawak's 1.5 million residents, most of them villagers, is a pinnacle of exotica that looks as if it got lost on the way to Houston. It is called the Sarawak Plaza Shopping Complex -- 10 stories of offices and shops, plus a parking garage and an adjacent Holiday Inn. It is the newest of five such shopping complexes in Kuching.    Outside the enclosed complex, the steamy air is heavy with the smell of diesel fumes and overripe fruit. Inside, frigid air carries the aromas from a Famous Amos chocolate-chip-cookie franchise. Disco beats pulsate from a dozen fashion boutiques and hair-styling salons ($6.40 will get you a cut and comb, $40 the fanciest permanent).    Since school is out, Sarawak Plaza is bustling with a species of teen-ager known in suburban America as the &quot;mall rat.&quot; Young men -- ethnic Chinese, Malays, Ibans -- wear baggy trousers and shirts, and their hair is slicked back with styling mousse. Girls with four shades of color between their eyelids and brows flit up and down escalators and in and out of music and video shops (you can rent this year's Oscar-winning &quot;Platoon&quot; for two days for $1.20).    Upriver, men demonstrate the business end of a blowgun. Here, at the Ngiu Kee department store, cosmetologists demonstrate the new Bio line of natural-ingredient makeup put out by Kenebo, the Japanese cosmetics firm. At the Sha Na Na fast-food shop, &quot;halal&quot; food -- food acceptable to orthodox Muslims -- is served: Halal fish-head curry costs $1.28, while a halal cheeseburger goes for 68 cents. One floor down, a sign reads in Malay: &quot;Kesedapanya Hingga Menjilat Jari,&quot; which translates to &quot;Tastiness Until Licking Fingers.&quot; Kentucky Fried Chicken, of course. A live, four-inch-long scorpion is displayed in a glass case at the mall's only tourist shop. &quot;It eats cockroaches,&quot; says Linda, the sales clerk. The mall, however, is much too cold and sanitary for cockroaches. &quot;I bring them from home,&quot; Linda says.    &quot;I am a headhunter,&quot; jokes Patricia Depeni, the Iban manager of the state tourist bureau's branch in the shopping center. She bursts into giggles. &quot;You must go upriver,&quot; she says.    We go upriver.    At the wharf in Sibu, express longboats rest hull to hull awaiting passengers heading up the Rajang River for Kapit and Belaga. Public express boat No. 5 has 52 padded seats. It is air-conditioned. As it roars upriver at 30 miles per hour, endless stretches of jungle fly by, punctuated by an occasional longhouse. The captain keeps an eye on the river for floating logs and other debris. Only a visitor stands on deck admiring the scenery.    Inside the cabin, the curtains are drawn so the other passengers can watch videos. First a Chuck Norris thriller. Then a British top-40 rock show. Then the clear favorite: Hulk Hogan wrestling. An old man of the Kenyah tribe, who sports quarter-sized holes in the tops and lobes of both ears to accommodate ceremonial ornaments, is riveted to the action, especially when a black wrestler dressed as an African jungle savage enters the ring.    Here we are later in Kapit's only air-conditioned bar, and thus the town's hot spot, with yesterday's phone call from Anaheim still ringing in our ears. We are confessing failure to a local friend. But he is having trouble hearing because a Malay-Filipino rock band, called D-Illusions and as flat as the draft beer, is belting out a charming 20th-century lyric, &quot;Gimme money, that's what I want.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
