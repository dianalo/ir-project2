He realizes that the script calls for22 straight minutes of speeches at one point. The pacing needs help.;   So heinserts the Doobie Brothers into the program, right between speeches byStanford President Donald Kennedy and Hewlett-Packard co-founders Bill Hewlettand David Packard. Makes sense to him.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  PARTY ANIMALFOR STANFORD, A STADIUM SPECTACULAR IS A BIG DEAL.BUT FOR BARNETT LIPTON, THE MEGA-EVENT MEISTER,IT'S REALLY NO BIG THING  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Cover Stories  </MEMO><TEXT>     All he has to do is &quot;build bridges&quot; in the script between Kennedy and theDoobies, and then the Doobies and Hewlett-Packard. This is not a problem,Lipton explains with single-minded logic: Kennedy represents the university;the Doobies, who do an annual benefit concert for the Lucile Salter PackardChildren's Hospital at Stanford, are big supporters of the university; andPackard and Hewlett are Stanford alumni.;   &quot;So that's how you build yourbridges,&quot; Lipton says, &quot;and if you can follow that, you're doing OK.&quot;;  Lipton is the spin master of the entertainment world.;   He is working out ofa trailer on the Stanford Stadium track with his assistants from Eventures,the New York production company that pulls together gigantic spectacles allyear long. The Stanford performance is billed as &quot;A Show So Big, It Took 100Years to Create.&quot;;   Now Lipton, 34, has produced bigger spectacles than thisone. Last June, there was the Operation Welcome Home ticker tape parade thatdrew 4.7 million people into the streets of New York to greet returningPersian Gulf soldiers. Even to Lipton, that's big.;   By comparison, theStanford bash is small potatoes. Even so, there are countless details to beknitted together. Lipton is responsible for everything. The parking lots abovethe stadium are filling with orange electric generators and trucks filled withcables, sound equipment and building materials for five stages. The Eventuresstaff is about to swell from 10 to 30. And on Saturday, after theStanford-Colorado football game, more than 100 Eventures techies will be onhand.;   &quot;As we say to our clients,&quot; Lipton remarks, &quot; 'All you have to do isshow up.' Or as one of our clients said to us, 'All I want to do is pick outwhat I'm gonna wear.' That was Sara Lee -- their head of marketing.&quot;;   Inputting the show together, Lipton worked with numerous Stanford committeesover the past six months for a fee that neither he nor Stanford will disclose.They went after local celebrities or performers with local connections. TedKoppel, master of ceremonies, graduated from Stanford in 1962. The Doobies, ofcourse, are from San Jose. Joan Baez lives in Woodside. Whoopi Goldberg usedto live in Berkeley. Bobby McFerrin lives in San Francisco. James Galway livesin Ireland, but he was originally going to collaborate with McFerrin for thisoccasion. The collaboration fell through, but $10,000 had already been spentto fly Galway and his wife in from Zurich (&quot;first class air, it's expensive&quot;),so he's going to perform anyway.;   On Wednesday, Lipton is making sure thecues for performers and technicians mesh. He reaches the point in the scriptwhere Koppel will introduce Baez singing &quot;Forever Young,&quot; Bob Dylan's ode toeternal youth.;   &quot;Harry, lemme try this on you,&quot; Lipton says by phone to hiscollaborator in San Francisco, a writer named Harry Muheim who graduated fromStanford in 1941.;   Lipton improvises Koppel's introduction: &quot;We'll now havea song called 'Forever Young,' a fitting sentiment to celebrate this brand-newcentenarian of ours, Stanford University!&quot;;   Just what Dylan intended.;   LIPTON grew up on Long Island, the son of aerospace engineers. He wasn'tinterested in theater or spectacle until he went to New York University as abiology major and took an elective course in theater design. After graduating,he promoted concerts in New Jersey: &quot;Marcel Marceau, Count Basie, Cheap Trick-- not on the same bill.&quot;;   In 1982, he became entertainment director for theWorld's Fair in Knoxville, Tenn., where he worked with a man named TommyWalker who had invented the football halftime show in the 1940s. From there,Lipton moved to the World's Fair in New Orleans and then made his big leap.;  He was recruited by mega-producer David Wolper to be production manager forthe 1984 Olympics opening and closing ceremonies in Los Angeles: &quot;No one inthis country had ever done anything that big before. We were kind of writingthe book.&quot;;   From Los Angeles, it was on to New York City. Lipton began toproduce extravaganzas for Radio City Music Hall and then went out on his own.In each of the last three years, he has won the Most Outstanding Spectacleaward, presented by Special Events magazine.;   To give you an idea of thesize of the recent events produced by Lipton, consider that he produced theGoodwill Games Welcoming Ceremony in Seattle last year. There was a cast of2,000, featuring Kenny Rogers, Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Moody Blues, BenVereen and Ronald Reagan. It was broadcast to 75 countries and viewed by anestimated 1 billion people.;   But the size of the television audience isn'twhat's important, Lipton says. Rather, spectacular events &quot;are a great way tocommunicate important themes to people in an exciting way. In an age wheneverything's electronic, it's nice to get people together to celebrate -- thatgoes back as long as man has existed.&quot;;   &quot;Of course, the underlying messagethrough all of this,&quot; he says, returning to a discussion of the Stanford show,&quot;is something from a speech by Abe Lincoln, which we use over and overthroughout the script. And what Lincoln said was, 'As the occasion is piledhigh with difficulty, we must rise with the occasion.' &quot;;   Lipton thenrecites Stanford history: how the university was founded by railroad magnateLeland Stanford after the death of his beloved only child. The father had adream while in Florence, Lipton says: &quot;He woke up and said to his wife, 'Allthe children of California shall be our children.' &quot;;   Today, as Stanford isracked by scandal and anticipates $40 million in budget cuts next month -- afact not lost on one university professor who characterizes Monday's event as&quot;culturally obscene&quot; -- Lipton thinks the triumph-over-adversity theme appliesmore than ever.;   &quot;Stanford has survived a lot over the years and willcontinue,&quot; he concludes. &quot;And the one thing that the newspapers and everyoneforgets is that the quality of the university hasn't suffered.&quot;;   LIPTON hasset himself a noon Wednesday deadline for editing the script for Mondaynight's two-hour show. He has one more transition to refine. This time Koppelis going to introduce Oakland's great gospel choir director, Edwin Hawkins.Times have changed since the Edwin Hawkins Singers had a hit with &quot;Oh, HappyDay&quot; in 1969. On Monday night Hawkins is going to lead the 200-voice StanfordCentennial Chorus in a rousing version of the Stanford marching band's fightsong, &quot;All Right Now,&quot; which was a big hit for the rock group Free in 1970.;  And here are the words, written by Lipton and Muheim, that Ted Koppel willread Monday:;   &quot;For Stanford, for the nation, for the planet, the occasion isstill piled high with difficulty. And yet, if we step back for a moment andlook at this beautiful and decent place -- and if for just that moment we canput the great problems on hold -- why, we cannot help but conclude thatStanford is, well, all right, or as our band puts it musically in their fightsong, 'All Right Now!' &quot;;   IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; General admission ticketsfor the 8 p.m. Monday Stanford Centennial Stadium Spectacular are $25, with a$5 discount for people holding a ticket stub to Saturday's football game.Tickets for Stanford students, faculty and staff -- as well as anyone 18 andunder -- are $15.
