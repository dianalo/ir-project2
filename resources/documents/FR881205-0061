The new designated methodis: EQL-1288-070, ``Determination of Lead Concentration in Ambient ParticulateMatter by Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry(Silver Valley Laboratories).''The applicant's request for an equivalent method determination for theabove method was received on October 17, 1988.This method has been tested by the applicant, Silver Valley Laboratories,Inc., in accordance with the test procedures prescribed in 40 CFR Part53. After reviewing the results of these tests and other information submittedby the applicant, EPA has determined, in accordance with Part 53, thatthis method should be designated as an equivalent method. The informationsubmitted by the applicant will be kept in file at EPA's Atmospheric Researchand Exposure Assessment Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina,and will be available for inspection to the extent consistent with 40 CFRPart 2 (EPA's regulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act).This method uses the sampling procedure specified in the reference methodfor the determination of lead in suspended particulate matter collectedfrom ambient air (43 FR 46258). Lead in the particulate matter is solubilizedby extraction with nitric acid facilitated by heat. The lead content ofthe sample is analyzed by a Thermo-Jarrell Ash inductively coupled argonplasma optical emission spectrometer using the 220.35 nm lead emissionline and instrument conditions optimized by the user laboratory. A sampleof the extract solution is nebulized to form an aerosol which is excitedwith high temperature argon gas produced by passing of argon through apowerful radio frequency field. Radiation emitted from the plasma entersa spectrometer where it is separated into selected wavelengths and sensedby separate photomultipler tubes for each element of interest. The luminousenergy thus measured is converted to an output signal which can be relatedto the concentration of each element of interest in the sample. Technicalquestions concerning the method should be directed to Silver Valley Laboratories,Inc., P.O. Box 929, Kellogg, Idaho 83837.As a designated equivalent method, this method is acceptable for use bystates and other control agencies under requirements of 40 CFR Part 58,Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes the method must beused in strict accordance with the procedures and specifications providedin the method description. States or other agencies using inductively coupledargon plasma optical emission spectrometric methods that employ proceduresand specifications significantly different from those in this method mustseek approval for their particular method under the provisions of section2.8 of Appendix C to 40 CFR Part 58 (Modification of Methods by Users)or may seek designation of such methods as equivalent methods under theprovisions of 40 CFR Part 53.Additional information concerning this action may be obtained by writingto Director, Quality Assurance Division (MD-77), Atmospheric Research andExposure Assessment Laboratory, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, ResearchTriangle Park, North Carolina 27711.For Further Information Contact: Frank McElroy at (919) 541-2622.<ITAG tagnum="6">John H.
