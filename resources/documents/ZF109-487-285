(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Michigan State Senate Elects an EISandM;Building an executive information system (EIS) is usually a political hotpotato kept cool only by focusing the system on one executive's needs.andP;  Soimagine the politics involved when there are 38 potential EIS users and eachone is--literally--a politician.andM;That's what's happening in the Michigan State Senate, in Lansing.andM;&quot;It took a lot of champions working the Senate floor almost as they would fora bill,&quot; said Caryl Holland, deputy director of the Senate InformationService (SIS), the information-system department of the state Senate thatcreated the EIS.andM;But today there is laughter in her voice as she counts the senators currentlyusing the EIS.andP;  Holland also looks ahead to upgrades planned over the nextseveral months.andM;Of the 38 members of the Michigan State Senate, 34 opted to go with the EISand four declined to get a system in the Republican-dominated chamber.andP;  Allfour who opposed it were Republicans; they said the system was unnecessarilyexpensive (at about $18,000 for the installation of the system and a new PCat each desk of the Senate floor).andP;  The small opposition was particularlybitter about the way the system was brought in--as part of a overallrenovation and restoration project.andM;&quot;A handful of people pushed this system through without a vote.andP;  The cost totaxpayers has never been justified, and I do not see any advantage in havinga computer,&quot; said Sen.andP;  Jack Welborn, one of the four who refused a computer.andM;A growing number of state senators would disagree.andP;  For one thing, there arethe 34 who are enjoying the system, which flashes votes in progress on thescreen of each senator's PS/2.andP;  The system also provides full text retrievalof pending bills, shows who is speaking and who is due to speak on the floor,and provides E-mail.andP;  For 14 elected officials, the system also provides agateway to their office LANs so they can work on correspondence and othermatters while waiting for speakers to change or executive sessions to end onthe Senate floor.andM;&quot;The value of the system is demonstrated by the growing use of it tocommunicate with our own LANs,&quot; argued Sen.andP;  John Schwarz.andM;&quot;As all the senators avail themselves of the system's full capabilities, wewill be a paperless Senate.andP;  That will cut costs as well,&quot; he added.andM;Cost cutting clearly was not the selling point of the system, all of itssupporters acknowledge.andP;  It was a case of making a senator's desk a morepowerful decisionmaking tool.andM;&quot;We saw the renovation project as a window of opportunity,&quot; explained BillSnow, former assistant secretary of the Senate who was elected secretary in1988.andP;  At the time he was assistant secretary he was already a power user andhad become aware of the growing use of systems in a half-dozen state Senateoffices.andM;Snow says a core of advocates was developed and a committee was formed withSchwarz and fellow Republican Sens.andP;  John Engler and Bill Sederburg as wellas Democrat Sen.andP;  John Cherry.andP;  The group commissioned a feasibility studythat ruled out mainframe and mini systems and suggested networked computingas the best platform.andP;  Committee members allocated funds out of therenovation budget in 1989.andM;&quot;[SIS] staffers spent a lot of time on the Senate floor interviewing senatorsand trying to establish needs,&quot; said SIS' Holland.andP;  Eventually, they set updemonstration screens and let the senators watch the progress and give ustheir concerns.&quot;andM;The committee named the EIS the Chamber Automation System.andP;  The minimum theEIS had to provide was to give the senators running tallies on votes and helpthem identify who had voted and how.andP;  E-mail was added to the system at itsinception, built on top of a voting package sold by Decision Resources Corp.andO;of Washington.andP;  The system--which ran under Windows 2.0--eventually includeda daily calendar and an automatic &quot;intercom&quot; facility that allowed them toflag the Sergeant at Arms and request that a page be sent to their desks.andO;The system will be upgraded on Windows 3.0 early next year, Holland said.andM;A dedicated voting processor was added to the Token-Ring network that runs ona Novell NetWare 286 network.andP;  The processor handles vote tallyingexclusively and lightens the load on the file server.andM;&quot;They have added a great deal of value in just one year,&quot; said Schwarz.andP;  &quot;Andwe are looking for more in the future.andP;  I can't understand why anyone wouldfight to stay in the old paper era.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
