At least two weeks. Gotta be twoweeks. Or they might get slapped with a regulatory citation.   What? Has America's banking crisis come to this:Regulators are now ordering mandatory vacations?</LP><TEXT>   Absolutely. In fact, they've been doing it for years.   &quot;It's banking folk wisdom that, believe it or not, isactually written into our regulatory procedures,&quot; says EllenStockdale of the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,which regulates all federally insured banks. The two-weekpolicy applies to savings and loans and credit unions aswell. The idea, says Ms. Stockdale, is that &quot;in 10consecutive business days off, if someone's hand is in thetill, it will show up. It's hard to manipulate the books whenyou're on vacation.&quot;   That's right. Summertime . . . and the investigating iseasy.   The policy &quot;is especially useful in certain types offraud, like check kites, deposit scams and playing with trustfunds,&quot; says James G. Richmond, who oversees the JusticeDepartment's probes of savings and loan fraud. &quot;It's not asimple matter of arresting people after their August getaway,but in terms of bank fraud, vacation time is a good place tostart.&quot;   Whether banks have a branch in the U.S. or are based here,they are governed by U.S. regulatory guidelines. ConstantinPhacos, a vice president in the Geneva office ofManufacturers Hanover Corp., was vacationing in Washington,D.C., last fall when a customer's call alerted a bank clerkto accounting irregularities. Mr. Phacos was called home fromhis vacation and charged with embezzlement, forgery andmisappropriation of client funds. He denies the charges,which haven't yet come to trial. Manufacturers Hanoverrecently took a $50 million charge against earnings to coverhis alleged crimes.   &quot;The first thing you should be suspicious of,&quot; says ClareSykes of New York's Banking Department, &quot;is anyone in bankingwho doesn't want to take a vacation.   &quot;The problem is with Japanese bankers who work here forbanks based in Japan,&quot; Ms. Sykes adds. &quot;They're used togetting one week, and here they take two. But they always areadamant that we note in our examination reports that it isrequired {by regulators}. Otherwise their bosses in Tokyowill think they're sloughing off.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
