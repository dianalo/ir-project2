At 2 p.m. HST Tuesday, the hurricane was 450 miles southeast ofHilo, on Hawaii Island, moving slightly north of a westerly courseat 12 mph, the National Weather Service said. Its maximum sustainedwind speed was 75 mph; a storm is classified a hurricane when thatspeed reaches 74 mph. Wind gusted to 90 mph.   The weather service said it was too early to tell whether theslight shift north portended a significant change in course orwhether it meant Dalilia had a ``wobbling eye,'' a fairly commonphenomenon among hurricanes.   If the hurricane took a more northwesterly course, it would passcloser to the southern coasts of the islands, the service said in astatement.   Earlier in the day, data provided by the crew of an Air Forcehurricane-hunting airplane indicated the hurricane's center wasslightly farther south than it was Monday, said Clarence Lee, headof the Central Pacific Hurricane Center here.   If it continued on the track determined by the airplane, Daliliawould pass 250 miles south of Hawaii Island, southernmost in theHawaiian chain, Wednesday morning, Lee said.   Dalilia's rapid westerly movement had slowed by nearly half from20 mph during a 24-hour period, he added.   ``Dalilia's current location and apparent movement is a favorablesign for Hawaii,'' Lee said. ``If the trend continues, the hurricanemay pass far south of the island chain and the only effect ... wouldbe an increase in surf along the southern coasts of the islands.''   A tropical storm watch remained in effect for Hawaii Island,meaning wind up to 73 mph and heavy rain were possible if Daliliamoved farther north than expected.   Hawaii Island residents were urged to stock up on batteries,canned goods and other emergency supplies in case the storm veerednorthward.   A high surf advisory was issued for beaches along the south shoreof Hawaii Island, southernmost in the Hawaiian chain, inanticipation of waves as high as 15 feet.   ``We're going to be keeping these beaches closed as aprecautionary measure,'' said Bruce Butts, a spokesman for HawaiiCounty Civil Defense. ``The tides are pretty high. That will makesurf especially dangerous.''</TEXT></DOC>
