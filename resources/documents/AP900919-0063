The seizure order also applies to all companies based incountries enforcing the sanctions.   The official Iraqi News Agency said the ruling RevolutionaryCommand Council ordered the seizure Tuesday night under a lawdealing with the protection of ``Iraqi interests, money and rightsin Iraq and abroad.''   ``All assets - cash deposits, property, interest and otherrevenue - belonging to the governments, institutions, companies andbanks of the countries that have joined oppressive resolutionsagainst Iraq are hereby confiscated,'' said the new law, the textof which was carried by INA.   The statement did not provide estimates for foreign assets inIraq, or say how much cash was involved.   Four days after Iraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait, the U.N.Security Council imposed an embargo on trade with Iraq, choking offIraq's oil exports and blocking goods heading for the nation. Mostcountries, including the United States, have followed thesanctions.   Iraq will also collect any interest accumulated by the seziedassets, the agency reported in a dispatch monitored in Nicosia.   The council, headed by President Saddam Hussein, is Iraq'shighest policy-making body. It is the only body that can overrideIraq's National Council, or parliament.   The text made no mention of Kuwait, but earlier councildecisions have stated that Iraqi law applies to the emirate, whichBaghdad annexed six days after the invasion.   The United States and Britain froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assetsimmediately after the invasion. Other countries, including allEuropean Community nations, quickly followed suit.   President Bush said in a televised message to the Iraqi peopleon Sunday that Saddam's invasion of Kuwait was going to cost thenation an average of $20 billion a year in lost oil revenue.   Iraq piled up a foreign debt of $60 billion to $70 billion,about half of it owed to Arab states, during its eight-year waragainst Iraq which ended in 1988. It has unilaterally canceled itsdebt of about $10 billion to Kuwait.   The rest of the money is owed to Japan, Italy, Britain, Franceand the Soviet Union, most of for arms bought on credit during thewar.   The new Iraqi law said foreign governments that froze Iraqiassets after the invasion of Kuwait, ``are responsible forsafeguarding the cash and the assets and for protecting any revenuecoming from accumulating interest on investments.''   Banks, it added, were ``fully responsible for protecting Iraqicash plus the interest, revenue and any other rights owed toIraq.''   Iraqi companies, private and government, ``are not responsibilein any way for losses resulting from any delay by foreign firms infulfilling contracts in Iraq. But these firms are held responsiblefor for any damge inflicted on the Iraqi side.''   Iraqi courts have also been ordered to reject any applicationfor any case against Iraqi firms - private or government - anddeclared any ruling by foreign courts against Iraqi firms ``nulland void.''</TEXT></DOC>
