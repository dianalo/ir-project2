They were done by professionals. . . .That doesn't have the same staying power.&quot;;    Some big things did change as aresult of the war. Robert G. Neumann, a former U.S. ambassador to Morocco,Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia, assessed them this way: &quot;The real legacy of thewar will be what happens with the Arab-Israeli peace process. The enormouspower the United States demonstrated during the war should enhance itsinfluence, but that remains to be seen.&quot;;    There were other changes on thehome front:;    (check) President Bush, once derided as a wimp, has become sopopular that it seems the country is ready to grant him his second termwhenever he asks.;    (check) The U.S. military, after decades of scorn forincompetence and waste, in the eyes of many Americans is once more thefriendly beat cop on the world's corner.;    (check) After the oil-price panicof late last year, the U.S. motoring public is enjoying what oil expert DanielYergin calls &quot;the lowest level of gasoline prices, inflation-adjusted, sincethe second world war.&quot;;    James Olson, a historian at Sam Houston StateUniversity in Huntsville, Texas, and a specialist on the Vietnam War, says ofDesert Storm: &quot;It closed a loop that had been open since the 1960s, and wefound exhilaration in it.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  GARY BLONSTON, Mercury News Washington Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910728  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  614  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday July 28, 199100210149,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
