That's the idea behind a Medicaid trust. It's used bypeople who want the government to help pay for their nursinghome care before all their assets are depleted. But Medicaidwon't pick up any costs until you have practically no assets.</LP><TEXT>   A basic tool of Medicaid planning, the trust creates aplace where people can put their assets so they can meet thegovernment criteria. Typically, the government says aMedicaid recipient can have no more than $2,000 in assets.But the trust carries a high price: Once people put theirassets into such a trust, they no longer have control overtheir own money.   For some, the price is too high. &quot;I almost never dothose,&quot; says Scott R. Severns, an Indianapolis attorneyspecializing in law for the elderly. &quot;They are tooinflexible.&quot; However, others say Medicaid trusts, while notright for everyone, can provide valuable protection forpeople with a nursing home in their future.   Medicaid trusts aren't new. In the mid-1970s, these trustswere structured so that trustees could disperse principal attheir discretion. That structure no longer works. Thegovernment now says that as long as assets can be distributedby the trustee for the benefit of the Medicaid applicant,they count in any Medicaid calculation.   But with each change of the law, creative lawyers havefound new ways to allow people to qualify for Medicaidcoverage without bankrupting themselves or their spouses.   The current technique uses an irrevocable trust. A personcan put some or all of his assets into a trust, whichprovides him with income but no access to the principal. Thecost to set up such a trust: typically $1,000 to $2,500.   Take the hypothetical case of Jim, who has $150,000 incertificates of deposit invested at 8% a year. He puts theentire amount into an irrevocable trust, retaining the$12,000 annual income it produces. When he goes into anursing home three years later, his $12,000 in income goes tohelp pay the $25,000 annual bill. But his $150,000 of CDs isinaccessible, so Medicaid picks up the rest of the costs.Upon his death, his children get the principal.   The result: If Jim ever gets healthy enough to leave thenursing home, his $12,000 a year income is still there. Andwhen he dies, his estate will go to his heirs instead of torepay nursing home costs.   For married people, these trusts have an additionalwrinkle. Because Medicaid lets each spouse keep his or herown income, the trust can direct the income to either spouseor both. In some cases, you can even set up trusts to shiftthe income from one to another upon certain events, such asthe entry of one spouse into a nursing home.   But creating an irrevocable trust and transferring allyour assets to it while you are still healthy is a &quot;drasticmove,&quot; says Alexander Bove, a Boston attorney and Medicaidplanning specialist. As a result, he often recommends the useof a convertible trust, which allows a person to keep controlof his assets while healthy, but immediately converts to anirrevocable income-only trust once he is in a nursing home.   One problem with a convertible trust is that &quot;it doesn'tnecessarily work everywhere in the country,&quot; says ArmondBudish, a Cleveland lawyer. In Ohio, he says, the state woulddeem such a trigger &quot;against public policy.&quot; The same may betrue, he says, for trusts that shift income to, let's say,the wife when the husband enters a nursing home.   Moreover, trusts don't always provide the protectionpeople expect. Some states have strict Medicaid income caps,and people who make one penny more are deemed ineligible. Inthese states, &quot;the trust income might put you over the incomelimit, therefore making the whole trust concept totallyworthless,&quot; says Peter J. Strauss, a New York attorneyspecializing in law for the elderly.   The answer here, he says, is to set up a trust that limitsthe income from the trust so that the applicant's totalincome from all sources is less than the maximum allowablefor Medicaid.   In some cases, trusts generate too little money for peopleto live on before they enter a nursing home. Mr. Strauss saysthat in these cases, he recommends clients put only a portionof their assets in trust, retaining the rest to supplementtheir income.   Trusts also do little for people who have too much money.For example, someone with $1 million in a trust would find itthrowing off more than enough income to pay for the nursinghome, canceling any advantage of the trust. Folks with thatkind of money shouldn't be talking about Medicaid trustsanyway, says Mr. Strauss, calling efforts to shield assets inthese circumstances &quot;unethical.&quot;   Whom do these trusts work best for? People with $50,000 to$400,000 of assets, excluding their home, says Mr. Budish.Mr. Bove sets the limit higher, at about $700,000.   Funding of an irrevocable trust -- either directly orthrough a convertible trust -- automatically triggers awaiting period of up to 30 months before a person can qualifyfor Medicaid. Thus, if either a husband or wife went into anursing home during that waiting period, Medicaid wouldn'tpay, and they might not have the money to pay the nursinghome bills.   To avoid such a family crisis, the trust can be structuredso that either spouse can get principal payments through theend of the waiting period. Other options: Keep enough moneyout of the trust to cover nursing home bills during theinterim period, or buy a nursing home insurance policy to dothe same.   Some advisers like to build a safety valve into the trust.One method is to allow termination of the trust under certaincircumstances, with the money paid out to the namedbeneficiary, usually the children. Others say this method mayraise legal questions; they prefer allowing the trustee todistribute principal to children or grandchildren undercertain circumstances.   Finally, people should be careful not to name their estateas beneficiary of the trust when they die. &quot;I am hard pressedto think of a worse idea,&quot; says Mr. Bove, noting that all thetrust assets would then end up in probate, which they wouldotherwise avoid. The result: added legal fees, delayedreceipt of the estate's assets by intended beneficiaries, andthe possibility that the state could sue the estate torecover the Medicaid money spent on the deceased's nursinghome care.</TEXT></DOC>
