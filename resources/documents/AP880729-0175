(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An arrest for underage drinking triggered alate night riot with 50 young people marching on the policestation, breaking windows, and bending a flag pole and taking theflag, police said Friday.   A crowd of up to 300 people gathered during the hour-long melee,prompting the 13-member police force to call on state police andeight nearby communities for reinforcements.   Damage in the town of about 13,000 people in northcentralPennsylvania was estimated at several thousand dollars. Six adultsand two youths were arrested. Three police officers were treatedfor minor injuries.   Mayor Charles E. Moll imposed a state of emergency, prohibitinggroups of youths from walking the streets between 8 p.m. and 7 a.m.for five days.   ``I'm particularly disturbed about them bending over the flagpole and taking the flag,'' he said.   The disturbance was seen as the culmination of months of tensionbetween police and young people who gather on the town's mainthoroughfare, Market Street.   ``All they want to do is loaf on the main street,'' Moll said.``There's drugs, there's drink, there's sex.''   Tensions flared late Thursday when police tried to arrest ateen-age girl and another youth for alleged underage drinking onMarket Street.   Police said the two, whom they would not identify, resistedarrest. During a struggle, an officer was kicked in the groinseveral times and other police were called, Brown said.   During the arrest, a group of 30 to 40 youths stood across thestreet and yelled obscenities, police said.   After the two youths were wrestled into a police car, the groupmarched toward the police station, growing to about 50 people whoknocked over trash cans and a soda machine, police said.   At the police station, witness Kerry Wolf of Selinsgrove said hesaw about six or seven people pull up plants, smash windows andurinate inside. Some people grabbed a rope on the flagpole outsidethe station, yanked on it and bent the pole and tore off the flag.   Within 15 minutes, after reinforcements had arrived, about 75officers and Sunbury firefighters formed a line and dispersed thecrowd.   Several witnesses told The Daily Item newspaper that police wererough with the juveniles and later used nightsticks on somebystanders.   Wolf told the newspaper he saw the girl's head being slammed onthe roof of the police car. ``They did rough-house that kid,'' saidRoger Lauver, 23, of Sunbury.   Sgt. Stephen Brown said police threw no punches. ``Force issometimes necessary to effect an arrest,'' he said.   Moll said he was satisfied with police conduct.</TEXT></DOC>
