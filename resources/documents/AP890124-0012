Five soldiers were killed and more than 30 soldiers and policewounded, the government news agency Telam reported. Carlos Becerra,secretary general to President Raul Alfonsin, said at least 20commandos were killed.   At 9:30 p.m., a handful of commandos were holed up in an officersclub that soldiers had attacked with tanks and set on fire.   Moments earlier, a small armory exploded, sending bright flames100 yards high into the darkness. Sporadic gunfire and an occasionalmortar round could be heard from inside the spacious compound.   The battles began when an estimated 30 to 50 commandos used astolen Coca Cola delivery truck to crash through the main gate ofthe 3rd infantry regiment in La Tablada on the outskirts of BuenosAires.   The casualty toll was much higher than in the three militaryinsurrections against Alfonsin's government during the past 21months.   In the military revolts of April 1987 and January and December1988, soldiers were extremely reluctant to fire on fellow soldiers.   The commandos did not identify themselves or state their motives.But a woman who called the independent news agency Diarios yNoticias said she was part of the commando group and said it actedto prevent a military coup.   ``It was to defend democracy and now they're massacring us,''said the woman, who refused to identify herself or the commandogroup. ``Please, do something.''   Military officials and government spokesmen, including Alfonsin'spress secretary, Jose Ignacio Lopez, said the commandos were leftistguerrillas and not soldiers or members of a right-wing group.   No similar incidents were reported at other bases throughout thisSouth American country of 31 million.   The officials offered little evidence to support their contentionthat the commandos were leftists, but party leaders and unions fromacross the political spectrum who denounced the incident did notchallenge the government's claim.   Hundreds of area residents who gathered outside the base shoutedsupport for the troops. ``Kill them!'' people shouted as troops ledaway commandos captured after they fled burning, smoking buildings.   Live national television coverage showed tanks rumbling alongcity streets, bleeding soldiers carried to ambulances andhelicopters, residents fleeing, and burning, smoking buildings.   Cesar Jaroslavsky, president of the ruling Radical Civic Union'sbloc in the House of Deputies, said some of the commandos weremembers of the Peoples Revolutionary Army, which engaged soldiers inopen battle a decade ago but has been inactive since. He identifiedone as Jose Luis Caldu, but he provided no details.   After entering La Tablada at about 6 a.m., the commandos foundthemselves trapped almost immediately when Buenos Aires provincialpolice surrounded the base 12 miles northwest of the capital.   By early afternoon, the commandos were confined to the red brickofficers club and several other buildings. Soldiers, includingmembers of an elite paratroop brigade, blasted the buildings withtanks and mortars and set them on fire.   Some fled the base and hid out in buildings, firing sniper-styleat police and soldiers, local news agencies reported. The firingdropped off after nightfall, leading to speculation that somecommandos escaped.   The incident was the most serious of its kind since a combinedattack by Montonero and ERP guerrillas on the Monte Chingolo armyarsenal, nine miles south of Buenos Aires, in 1975.   Government House in downtown Buenos Aires, where Alfonsin was atwork Monday, and the president's official residence in suburbanOlivos, were reinforced with additional troops.   Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena and army chief Gen. FranciscoGassino took steps to retake the La Tablada base immediately andsent elite airborne troops to assist soldiers and provincial police.   Only about 100 officers and troops were at La Tablada at the timeof the attack, and the rest were spending the weekend off base,Telam said. Several dozen escaped from captivity after thecounterattack began.   Buenos Aires provincial police quickly surrounded the base,evacuated some area residents, diverted traffic and took upsharpshooter positions in homes and buildings.   The commandos threw out pamphlets saying ``Long Live Rico!'' and``Long Live Seineldin!'' as they entered the base. They referred tothe leaders of the three military insurrections, cashiered Lt. Col.Aldo Rico and Col. Mohamed Ali Seineldin.   The pamphlets created the impression the commandos wereright-wingers who supported the military position that the trials ofofficers for human rights abuses committed during the 1976-83military dictatorship should be terminated.   Rico and Seineldin, both of whom are in military prison, haddemanded cancellation of the trials and amnesty for those officersalready convicted.   Military sources said the commandos may have intended only tosteal weapons from the base and depart quickly, leaving thepamphlets behind to throw off pursuers.</TEXT></DOC>
