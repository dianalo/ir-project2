This authority originated ina Federal Power Commission order issued September 21, 1973 (Docket CP73-332).Subsequent orders amended Northwest's import authority in response to changesboth in its contractural arrangements with Westcoast and in related NationalEnergy Board (NEB) export authorizations. In particular, ERA Opinion andOrder No. 38 (Order 38), issued December 21, 1981, continued Northwest'sauthority to import natural gas at a price not to exceed the Canadian borderprice of $4.94 per MMBtu. The order extended the Kingsgate import authorityin accordance with the terms of Northwest's gas purchase agreement withWestcoast and included a phased-in reduction of volumes conforming to Westcoast'sNEB Export License GL-4. Order 56 continued the pricing authority and grantedNorthwest authority to shift up to 100 MMcf per day of Canadian gas authorizedfor import at Sumas, Washington, to the Kingsgate point of entry. Thatauthority continues through October 31, 1989.Northwest requests an amendment to its existing import authority to increasethe import volume during the balance of the primary import term from 100MMcf per day to up to 152 MMcf per day at Kingsgate. The incremental gasvolumes, like current volumes imported by Northwest at Kingsgate, wouldbe delivered directly into the facilities of Pacific Gas Transmission Company(PGT) and then transported by PGT to Northwest at an interconnecting pointnear Spokane, Washington, and at secondary points along PGT's system inIdaho, Washington, and Oregon.The gas imported by Northwest from Westcoast at Kingsgate is purchasedunder a contract dated September 23, 1960, as amended (Kingsgate salesagreement). The Kingsgate sales agreement provides for purchases of upto 152 MMcf per day, effective November 1, 1987, under specific terms andconditions which have most recently been amended by a letter agreementdated September 16, 1987 (Kingsgate amendment). The Kingsgate amendmentmodifies the take provisions and the two-part rate structure containedin a letter agreement dated October 27, 1986, amending both the Kingsgatesales agreement and the Fourth Service Agreement that covers the Huntingdonpoint of entry imports. The Kingsgate amendment, effective November 1,1987, applies to the gas, including the incremental volumes requested here,sold under the Kingsgate sales agreement as amended, during the final twocontract years, November 1987 through October 1989.Under the Kingsgate amendment, the two-part rate includes a demand chargefor gas purchased at the Kingsgate delivery point equal to an aggregate,determined monthly, of the following fixed cost components of the fourcost of service elements for transporting the gas sold by Westcoast toNorthwest to the Kingsgate delivery point: (i) The Alberta Natural GasCompany Ltd. (Alberta Natural) fixed cost component net of credits applicableto certain interruptible transportation services provided by Alberta Naturalto third parties and several other specified adjustments; (ii) the Kingsgatedemand charge representing the fixed administrative costs incurred by Westcoastand allocated to the gas sold to Northwest; (iii) The Pan-Alberta Gas Ltd.fixed cost component applicable to the cost of transporting through itssystem the gas delivered to Northwest at Kingsgate and; (iv) the NOVA,an Alberta Corporation, fixed cost component for transportation of gassold to Northwest by Westcoast. Northwest estimates this demand chargeto be less than seven million dollars annually. The commodity rate will be $1.50 per MMBTu initially. This rate is to berecalculated quarterly beginning January 1, 1988, under a formula thatadjusts this September/October 1987, base period rate to reflect subsequentchanges in two different fuels. The first is Westcoast's sale price ofgas to British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority (Hydro) for residentialand commercial customers. The second is the sales price of Bunker C fueloil in the Seattle and Portland areas. The factor of change by which thebase price is to be adjusted is weighted at 55 percent for gas and 45 percentfor fuel oil. The price of the comparable gas is to be the average purchaseprice paid by Hydro during the three calendar months immediately precedingthe effective date of the recalculated charge. The price of the fuel oilis to be similarly averaged from prices reported in the <T3>Bunkerfuels Report </T3>for the agreed upon areas. Additionally, either party may initiate renegotiation of the commoditycharge at any time under certain conditions, including relevant pricingconsiderations such as changes in alternate fuel price or availability,changes in price of Northwest's domestic supply or Northwest permanentlybecoming an open-access transporter.  According to the terms of the agreement, deficient annual purchases ofthree percent or less in a contract year will be added to the minimum annualvolume for the following contract year and paid for when actually taken.Conversely, up to three percent of any excess purchases in one contractyear, if total purchases do not exceed 105 percent of the minimum annualvolume, will be subtracted from the minimum annual volume in the subsequentyear. Deficiency volumes in excess of three percent must be paid for butcan be made up in a subsequent year. Under this amendment, Northwest agrees to take or pay for, at the commodityrate, a minimum annual volume of gas which, together with those volumesof gas purchased from Westcoast during the same contract year under theFourth Service Agreement, shall equal 45 percent of Northwest's actualsystem gas sales made during each such year. This represents an increaseof two percent of the system gas sales over its previous commitment. Purchasesfrom Westcoast for resale under its rate schedules X-36 and X-46 are notto be included as a part of this minimum annual volume. Northwest's actualsystem sales are to be increased by certain qualifying displacement gasvolumes and released domestic gas volumes including any volume of Westcoast'sor Northwest's firm system supply gas that is sold, either by Westcoast,or by a third party to whom such gas has been temporarily released, toone of Northwest's distribution or pipeline sales customers or to any end-userthat could be served by such a distribution or pipeline customer and which,by mutual agreement between Northwest and Westcoast, constitutes a marketsale that could have been made by Northwest at its posted tariff rates.However, in calculating the take-or-pay obligation, the qualifying displacementgas volumes are to be subtracted from the 45 percent take-or-pay portionof the system gas sales. Northwest claims the modified take-or-pay provisionultimately will reduce its take-or-pay obligation over the remainder ofthe term. The minimum annual volume provisions are subject to renegotiation if Canadianor U.S. regulatory policies or rulings change or Northwest becomes an open-accesstransporter of gas on a permanent basis.In support of its application, Northwest asserts that authorization ofthe requested additional daily volumes will enable it to meet system supplyrequirements, particularly in light of a concurrent reduction in its contractdemand for purchases from Westcoast at Sumas, Washington. Further, Northwestclaims that the Kingsgate amendment provides its most import arrangementwith flexibile market responsive terms ensuring that the gas will be pricedcompetitively in the markets served.In sum, Northwest submits that the provisions for quarterly adjustmentsin the commodity price, the inclusion in its pricing formula of the prevailingprice of Bunker C fuel oil in its market area and the linking of its minimumannual volume requirements to the actual level of its annual pipeline salesare within its existing authorization and makes its proposed amended Kingsgateimport arrangement more responsive to its changing market situations andmore competitive with alternate fuels.The decision on this application will be made consistent with the Secretaryof Energy's gas import policy guidelines, under which the competitivenessof the import arrangement in the markets served is the primary considerationin determining whether it is in the public interest (49 FR 6684, February22, 1984). Parties that may oppose this application should comment in theirresponses on the issue of competitiveness as set forth in the policy guidelines.The applicant has asserted that the proposed amended import arrangementis competitive and will be market responsive over the remaining term ofthe import authority. Parties opposing the amended arrangement bear theburden of overcoming this assertion.<ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures</ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to intervene,or notice of intervention, as applicable, and written comments.
