The KIO, which manages a multibillion-dollar investment portfolio for the Mideastern oil-producing nation, said it has acquired a further 92.5 million partly paid BP shares, bringing its holding to 779.5 million shares.    The BP shares traded late yesterday in London at 71 pence ($1.30), off a penny, valuing the additional holding at #65.7 million ($120.7 million) and the entire stake at #553.4 million. The price the KIO paid for the shares wasn't disclosed.    The KIO has been acquiring BP shares since the British government's #7.24 billion offering of its stake in the oil company in late October. To calm market fears following the stock-market crash, the government has offered to repurchase, for a limited period, any of the BP shares at 70 pence apiece. </TEXT></DOC>
