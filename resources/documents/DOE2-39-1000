The generated powerwould be converted to a microwave beam which is directed towards oneor more reflecting surfaces in geostationary orbit. These would reflectthe microwave beam to receiving antennae on earth near the point of consumptionwhere the microwaves would be converted to electricity for local use.Much of the world's hydropower remains unexploited because of its remotenessfrom centres of population. A detailed outline is given for a feasibilitystudy of a programme to make fuller use of the world's hydroelectricpotential by means of a satellite transmission system. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
