Though B.A.T Chairman Patrick Sheehy wants to keep the British conglomerate whole, he might have to dismember his empire to fend off the unwelcome #13.2 billion ($21.8 billion) bid from Sir James Goldsmith, the Anglo-French financier. A growing number of counterbid proposals points to such a scenario. The prospect is focusing attention on the breakup value and possible U.S. and European buyers for B.A.T's assets spanning 47 countries.    Many institutional investors &quot;would like to see a breakup under the auspices of B.A.T management, because then shareholders would get all the advantages and all the gain,&quot; Bruce Davidson, an analyst at London brokers Smith New Court, said. Heightened shareholder pressure, especially after an expected sweetened Goldsmith bid, means Mr. Sheehy &quot;may be forced into . . . chopping {B.A.T} up himself,&quot; Arnab Banerji, head of research at Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers in London, said.    Broken up, B.A.T's financial services, retailing and paper operations could reap more than #14 billion, analysts figure. The tobacco business alone might fetch between #4.6 billion and #6 billion. But tobacco might be the last business sold because of its consistent cash-generating capacity. Also, antitrust barriers would keep tobacco makers from acquiring B.A.T cigarette brands such as Kool, Lucky Strike and Benson andamp; Hedges.    Friendly and hostile counterbid ideas are swirling around London and New York. Two rival groups have approached some B.A.T institutional investors with alternative breakup bids. More will surely come, as almost every major U.S. and British securities firm that isn't already involved looks for ways to jump into Europe's biggest takeover. &quot;Everybody who is anybody has their slide rule out,&quot; said John Emly, head of British operations at Robert Fleming Asset Management, an arm of Robert Fleming andamp; Co. and a B.A.T shareholder.    AIM Group Zurich AG, a mergers advisory company based in Switzerland, claims a half-dozen big British institutions are studying its plan. The British merchant bank Baring Brothers andamp; Co. also has sounded out institutional holders about a breakup proposal. A spokesman for B.A.T said that it hasn't had any contact with AIM, and that &quot;We aren't in discussions with any parties about the sales of any businesses.&quot;    Hanson PLC, the British conglomerate renowned for its trans-Atlantic takeovers, is seen as another likely architect of a consortium bid. &quot;It is possible there could be a counteroffer from Hanson with or without arbitragers,&quot; said Alistair MacLennan, a senior fund manager at Norwich Union Insurance Group, which holds about 2% of B.A.T shares. Hanson appears to want a role in B.A.T's camp -- as seen in its recent decision to refrain from joining the Goldsmith group as a backer. &quot;We are watching what's going on with interest,&quot; John Patterson, a Hanson director, said.    Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and Forstmann Little andamp; Co., the two biggest U.S. leveraged buy-out funds, are known to be studying the B.A.T situation, as well. But Forstmann probably would have more freedom than KKR to jump in and buy assets put up for sale by Sir James, a rival bidder or Mr. Sheehy, the B.A.T chairman.    Here is a look at what B.A.T's major chunks probably would command in any breakup, and at who might want the businesses, based on a Wall Street Journal survey of about 10 British and U.S. analysts:    FINANCIAL SERVICES: The operation has a value of #5.7 billion to #8 billion, depending on your view of Farmers Group, the U.S.-based insurer that was acquired by B.A.T last December for $5.2 billion. Farmers unsuccessfully hunted for a friendly suitor to fight off B.A.T and even explored a leveraged buy-out through KKR.    Recalling this lack of rival bidders, some analysts said Farmers now may sell for as little as $3.5 billion. Analysts also cite the slowed pace of U.S. insurance industry profits and a recent voter referendum to trim insurance rates in California, Farmers' home market.    Allianz AG heads the list of possible buyers for Farmers or for B.A.T's British insurers, Eagle Star and Allied Dunbar. Last week, the West German insurance concern listed the U.S. as its first goal for any large acquisitions. Allianz considered a rival bid for Farmers during B.A.T's takeover fight and might do so again in a less expensive deal. In 1984, B.A.T outbid Allianz in a fierce three-month contest for Eagle Star, ultimately paying #968 million.    Italy's powerful Agnelli family, which has agreed to join the Goldsmith group as investors, also might seek Farmers. It has U.S. insurance interests through a substantial stake in a Luxembourg holding company with an 18% voting stake in Firemen's Fund Corp. But the family, which controls the Fiat S.p.A. empire, describes the insurance holding as an investment. Other potential European buyers include the giant Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. of Italy and Zurich Insurance Co. of Switzerland. Allianz and Zurich Insurance spokesmen played down the speculation, and a Generali spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.    RETAILING: These interests, including U.S.-based Marshall Field and Saks Fifth Avenue and the British catalog retailer Argos, might fetch between #2 billion and #3.6 billion. Marshall Field, which B.A.T bought for $368 million in 1982, would go for at least $1 billion, but less-profitable Saks would command just under $1 billion, suggested William N. Smith, a retailing analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. in New York.    Henry Kravis, KKR's chief, might pursue Saks Fifth Avenue because his wife, Carolyne Roehm, is a fashion designer. Among other potential U.S. bidders for the two well-known U.S. chains: May Department Stores Co.; Dillard Department Stores Inc.; Sears, Roebuck and Co.; and General Cinema Corp. Analysts speculated that Argos might be bought by the British jewelry chain Ratners Group PLC or the British retailer Sears PLC, which isn't related to Chicago-based Sears Roebuck.    PAPER: The business largely consists of U.S.-based Appleton Papers, the world's biggest producer of carbonless copying paper, and Wiggins Teape, a leading British paper and pulp producer with operations throughout Europe. Together, they may fetch between #2 billion and #2.5 billion, analysts estimated.    &quot;Who would buy them becomes a difficult question to answer,&quot; a London analyst said. &quot;In the U.K., a lot of the {paper} companies aren't very big. It would have to be a major U.S. player or someone who wants to diversify into that business.&quot; Buyers also might be scarce, because the world's paper industry appears headed for a downturn. But PWA AG, one of West Germany's largest paper product makers, might bid for Wiggins Teape, suggested Smith New Court's Mr. Davidson.    So far, Mr. Sheehy remains opposed to selling big chunks of the conglomerate, after spending nearly a decade trying to diversify. Some analysts see the B.A.T chairman breaking it up another way: floating the four major pieces as separate public companies. If Sir James &quot;stands any chance of successs, B.A.T advisers will do something along those lines, and try to release value for its shareholders without fat profit being creamed off&quot; by the Goldsmith group, Charles Pick, an analyst with Nomura Research Institute in London, said. &quot;Everything could be demerged.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
