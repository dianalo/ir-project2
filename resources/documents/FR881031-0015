Refugehunting programs are reviewed annually to determine whether the regulationsgoverning individual refuge hunts should be modified, deleted or addedto. Changing environmental conditions, State and Federal regulations, andother factors affecting wildlife populations and habitats may warrant modificationsto ensure the continued compatibility of hunting with the purposes forwhich the individual refuges involved were established and, to the extentpractical, make refuge hunting programs consistent with State regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>October 31, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Larry LaRochelle, Division ofRefuges, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 18th and C Streets NW., Room 2343,Washington, DC 20240; Telephone (202) 343-4313.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>50 CFR Part 32 contains provisionsgoverning hunting on national wildlife refuges. Hunting is regulated onrefuges to (1) ensure compatibility with refuge purposes, (2) properlymanage the wildlife resource, (3) protect other refuge values, and (4)ensure refuge user safety. On many refuges, the Service policy of adoptingState hunting regulations is adequate in meeting these objectives. On otherrefuges, it is necessary to supplement State regulations with more restrictiveFederal regulations to ensure that the Service meets its management responsibilities,as outlined under the section entitled ``Conformance with Statutory andRegulatory Authorities.'' Refuge-specific hunting regulations may be issuedonly after a wildlife refuge is opened to migratory game bird, upland game,or big game hunting through publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. These regulations may list the wildlife speciesthat may be hunted, seasons, bag limits, methods of hunting, descriptionsof open areas, and other provisions. Previously issued refuge-specificregulations for migratory game bird, upland game, and big game huntingare contained in 50 CFR 32.12, 32.22, and 32.32 respectively. Many of theamendments to these sections are being promulgated to standardize and clarifythe existing language of these regulations. Again this year, regulationsfor nontoxic shot are required on more refuges and consequently new regulationsare being added.The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practicable,to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.On July 13, 1988, at 53 FR 26461, the Service published a proposed rulemakingto amend certain regulations in 50 CFR Part 32 and invited the public tocomment. The Service's responses to those comments are contained in thefollowing section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Responses to Comments Received</ITAG>Written comments on the proposed rule were received from eight parties.In addition, an informal public meeting was held on the proposed deer hunton the Supawna Meadows National Wildlife Refuge at Pennsville, New Jerseyon July 28, 1988. Oral statements were received from several parties atthat meeting. Several comments were similar or identical to those receivedon previous proposed rulemakings opening refuges to hunting and/or fishingcontending generically that hunting on refuges is illegal, not in the spiritfor which refuges are created, violates the Endangered Species Act, oris not in compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act or variouslaws or regulations. These issues have been addressed by the Service, see<T3>e.g. </T3>51 FR 30655 of August 28, 1986, the final rule opening sevenrefuges to hunting and 11 to sport fishing, and the Service will not hererepeat its responses given in that rulemaking.Substantive comments on pertinent issues not already addressed in huntingand fishing plans, Environmental Assessments or section 7 Endangered SpeciesAct consultations (all of which were available for public review duringthe comment period) are responded to below:<T3>Issue: </T3>There is an inconsistency in the Service allowing toxicshot for hunting squirrels while requiring nontoxic shot to hunt waterfowlon the same refuge area.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service does not agree that allowing the use oftoxic shot for low intensity hunting of species seldom taking more thanone shot per target, while requiring nontoxic shot for high intensity waterfowlhunting, usually requiring multiple shots per target, is an inconsistencybut is rather a case of species-specific management of the problem of leadshot deposition/poisoning. Further, the Service has, in some cases, requiredthe use of nontoxic shot for shotgun hunting of all species of game inareas of heavy waterfowl use when so requested by State game departments.<T3>Issue: </T3>A National Organization lcoated in Washington, DC claimedthat a thirty-day comment period is inadeqaute to properly analyze changesin hunting programs and their regulations, especially when supporting data,if any, is scattered around the country at the refuges and six regionaloffices and that there was a lack of data to support the changes.<T3>Response: </T3>The Service notes that all documents supporting thisaction are on file in the Service's Washington, DC Office, available forpublic inspection. The Service believes that a 30-day comment period isadequate time for a business-like review and response on this and similaractions. To further delay implementing these regulations (by lengtheningthe comment period) would cause confusion to the public, deny a benefitto the public and related businesses and would not be in the best interestof the Service or the public. See the last paragraph of ``EnvironmentalConsiderations.''Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities The National WildlifeRefuge System Administration Act (NWRSAA) of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C.668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C. 460k) govern theadministration and public use of national wildlife refuges. Specifically,section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretary of the Interiorto permit the use of any area within the Refuge System for any purpose,including but not limited to, hunting, fishing and public recreation, accommodationsand access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the majorpurpose(s) for which the area was established.The Refuge Recreation Act authorizes the Secretary to administer areaswithin the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriate incidentalor secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistentwith the primary purpose(s) for which the areas were established. The RefugeRecreation Act also authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to carryout the purposes of the Act. Hunting plans are developed for each refugeprior to opening it to hunting. In many cases, refuge-specific huntingregulations are included in the hunting plan to ensure the compatibilityof the hunting programs with the purposes for which the refuge was established.Initial compliance with the NWRSAA and Refuge Recreation Act is ensuredwhen hunting plans are developed, and the determinations required by theseacts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists of areas opento hunting in 50 CFR. Continued compliance is ensured by annual reviewof hunting programs and regulations.Considering the rapidly approaching hunting seasons and the ones presentlytaking place, there is an immediate need to place these regulations intoeffect. The absence of refuge-specific hunting regulations for these huntingseasons would be contrary to the public interest (confusion on hours, baglimits, or firearm restrictions), and wildlife conservation (nontoxic shotrequirements). Thus, the Department concludes that good cause exists withinthe meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3) to make these regulations effective uponpublication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires the preparation of regulatory impact analysesfor major rules. A major rule is one likely to result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; or a major increase in costs orprices for consumers, individual industries, government agencies or geographicregions. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requries the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmentaljurisdictions.These amendments to the codified refuge-specific hunting regulations willmake relatively minor adjustments to existing hunting programs. The regulationsare not expected to have any gross economic effect and will not cause anincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,State, or local governments, agencies, or geographic regions. The benefitsaccruing to the public are expected to exceed by a large margin the costsof administering this rule. Accordingly, the Department of the Interiorhas determined that this rule is not a ``major rule'' within the meaningof E.O. 12291 and will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Service has received approval from the Office of Management and Budget(OMB) for the information collection requirements of these regulationspursuant to the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These requirements are presently approved by OMB underandplusmin;1018-0014 Economic and Public Use Permits. These regulations imposeno new reporting or recordkeeping requirements that must be cleared byOMB.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Considerations</ITAG>Compliance with the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (NEPA) (42U.S.C. 4332(C)) and the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531-1543)is ensured when hunting plans are developed, and the determinations requiredby these acts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists ofareas open to hunting in 50 CFR. Refuge-specific hunting regulations aresubject to a categorical exclusion from the NEPA process if they do notsignificantly alter the existing use of a particular national wildliferefuge. The changes enacted in this rulemaking will not substantially alterthe existing uses of the refuges involved.
