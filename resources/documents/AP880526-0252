The 72-27 decision settled the last major issue before flooraction on the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty.   The Senate later killed, 53-45, a Republican-backed amendmentwhich would essentially have reversed the earlier decision, andSenate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., angered that theSenate had spent time revisiting the same issue, abandoned effortsto finish action on the pact Thursday evening.   ``If we're going to continue to have Mickey Mouse amendmentslike this, the president is not going to have his treaty before heleaves the summit,'' Byrd told the Senate shortly before it quitfor the evening.   Byrd was angry because he said he felt the treaty interpretationissue had been settled by the earlier amendment, adopted by the72-27 margin. Byrd and other Democratic leaders had made victory onthe issue one of their major goals in the debate over the treaty.   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., agreed with Byrd thatwork on the treaty is likely to be finished Friday.   The INF treaty, signed Dec. 8 by Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev at their Washington summit, requireselimination within three years of U.S. and Soviet nuclear missileswith a range of 300 miles to 3,400 miles. It would result in theelimination of 867 U.S. missiles in Europe and elimination of 1,752Soviet missiles.   Ratification is assured because it only requires 67 votes and 90or more of the 100 senators are likely to vote for the pact,according to Byrd and other senators.   Approval would mean the treaty could be rushed to Moscow beforeReagan and Gorbachev meet Sunday at the summit. White House chiefof staff Howard Baker was standing by to carry the ratificationpapers to Reagan.   The pact will be the first ratified by the Senate since the 1972Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty. Also, it will be the first treaty toactually require the destruction of weapons, rather than simplyslowing the build-up, and its far-reaching verification provisionsinclude the first on-site inspections allowed by either superpower.   The Senate voted 96-0 approval Thursday of an amendment whichincorporates into the treaty agreements reached two weeks ago bySecretary of State George Shultz and Soviet Foreign Minister EduardShevardnadze, dealing with weapons using ``futuristic'' technologyand clarifying on-site verification rules.   The Senate has been working on the pact since last week, and thelast major hurdle was cleared Wednesday when Helms, the chiefcritic, dropped his opposition.   Byrd had scheduled a vote Thursday to halt the delaying tacticsused by Helms and other GOP conservatives, but that vote was setaside when offstage negotiations reached the agreement permittingthe final vote.   The main unresolved issue didn't affect the INF treaty, but itinvolved a long-running fight between the White House and theDemocratic-controlled Congress over the issue involving theconstitutional authority to interpret treaties.   The amendment approved Thursday requires Senate approval if anyfuture president tries to reinterpret the treaty.   The fight arose from Reagan's assertion that he has the legalauthority to unilaterally reinterpret the Anti-Ballistic MissileTreaty to permit expanded tests of his Star Wars anti-missiledefense.   Congressional Democrats have disputed that claim and argue thattheir amendment to the INF pact is an attempt to preserve theSenate's constitutional power to advise and consent on treaties.But critics say the amendment would unfairly restrict a president.   Byrd told his colleagues Thursday that accepting theadministration's claim to having unilateral power to reinterprettreaties ``would reduce the constitutional role of the Senate to amere nullity. The consent of the Senate would be reduced to aclerical function.''   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Armed Services Committee,agreed with Byrd, saying, ``We would be ill-served by that kind ofprocess and our foreign policy would be damaged severely.''   But Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said the amendment ``holds aswitchblade knife at the United States'' because it imposed astandard on the United States not imposed on the Soviet Union.   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., called the amendment ``palpablyridiculous, a dereliction of duty'' and said it would put theSenate on record as asserting authority he contended it did notpossess under the Constitution.   Ratification would cap an 11-year fight which began with the1977 deployment by the Soviet Union of SS-20 missiles, atriple-warhead weapon which was used to replace the Soviets' olderSS-4 and SS-5 missiles.   The first major alarm was raised in October, 1977, when HelmutSchmidt, then chancellor of West Germany, warned in a London speechthat the SS-20s were a serious threat to the North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.   In response, NATO began discussing deployment of newatomic-tipped weapons. Those discussions culminated in the Dec. 13,1979 decision by NATO to adopt what became known as the``two-track'' decision. That involved the dual decision to bothpursue arms negotiations at the same time new U.S. atomic weaponswere being installed.   NATO decided that four years later, beginning in late 1983, itwould deploy 572 new U.S. atomic weapons, including 108 PershingIIs which would be stationed in West Germany, and another 464ground-launched cruise missiles for deployment in Britain, Italy,West Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.   Late in 1981, Reagan announced that his administration wasadopting the so-called ``zero option'' as its position in the INFtalks. The U.S. plan, which originated with West Germanpoliticians, called for halting the planned U.S. deployments if theSoviets withdrew their SS-20s. Administration critics said the U.S.plan was unrealistic.   In 1982, Paul Nitze, the top U.S. negotiator, and his Sovietcounterpart, Yuli Kvitsinsky, agreed privately on a formula for aproposed INF agreement. It became known as the ``walk in thewoods,'' but it was rejected by both the U.S. and Sovietgovernments.   The NATO deployments started in November 1983, in West Germany,and the Soviets responded by walking out of the INF talks.   The negotiations resumed in the spring of 1985, after Gorbachevtook over power.</TEXT></DOC>
