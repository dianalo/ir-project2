This is one of the first uses of a new state law that allows action against pesticides believed to harm the offspring of agricultural workers. The state said it found no risks to consumers eating produce sprayed with the chemical, the traditional reason for suspending or ultimately banning pesticides. Under the suspension, the chemical, cyhexatin, cannot legally be sold or used in California.    Dow said it would request permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to change the labeling on products containing cyhexatin to, among other things, restrict women of child-bearing age from mixing, loading or applying products containing the chemical and extend the period before reentry of fields where cyhexatin has been applied, &quot;to provide even greater margins of safety.&quot;    The Midland, Mich., chemical company added, however, that even with current labeling, the products, &quot;when used in accordance with label directions, do not present an imminent or immediate health risk.&quot;    Julio Calderon, a spokesman for California's Department of Food and Agriculture, said the agency probably would hold public hearings on the suspension within 90 days. The state government then would decide whether to order a permanent ban.    No other state or federal agency has taken action against cyhexatin-related products, according to a Dow spokesman, Terry L. Witt. He said the EPA was reviewing the chemical but hadn't issued a decision on its safety. An EPA spokesman couldn't be reached for comment.    Cyhexatin is used to kill harmful mites while preserving desirable mites and other insects. Dow said it sells about $10 million in products containing the chemical every year, including about $4 million in California.    &quot;It's not a major U.S. product for Dow Chemical Co., but (the suspension) could have a significant impact on the major industry in California in terms of taking away a valuable tool,&quot; Mr. Witt said.    Under the Birth Defect Prevention Act, the state of California can request information from pesticide producers on the effects of exposure on women of child-bearing age. The state would prefer minimal risk at as much as 100 times the normal exposure level, but data supplied by Dow showed that exposure to as little as three times the regular quantity of cyhexatin was unsafe, Mr. Calderon said. </TEXT></DOC>
