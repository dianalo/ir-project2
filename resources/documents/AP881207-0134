Crew members ended their four-day flight Tuesday with a smoothtouchdown at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. They left for Houstonseveral hours later, arriving home early Wednesday.   After getting a day off, the astronauts will begin several weeksof debriefings on their classified military flight. NASA and the AirForce have refused to discuss the mission's main goal, but sourcessaid it was deployment of a $500 million satellite that can spy onthe Soviet Union through clouds and darkness and will someday serveas a ``radar eye'' for the new stealth bomber.   Atlantis' crew members were Navy Cmdr. Robert Gibson, thecommander; Air Force Lt. Col. Guy S. Gardner, the pilot; Air ForceCol. Richard M. Mullane, Air Force Lt. Col. Jerry L. Ross and NavyCmdr. William M. Shepherd. The flight was the first trip to spacefor both Gardner and Shepherd.   More than 200 people welcomed the astronauts home when theyarrived at Ellington Field, compared with the nearly 5,000well-wishers who turned out for the celebrated return of Discovery'sfive astronauts.   ``I can't believe all of you are out here at one o'clock in themorning,'' Gibson said. ``This is incredible. I expected just a hopin the cars and go.''   ``It really was a great flight,'' Gardner said. ``I think we dida good job for NASA and the space program and I think we did somegood things for our country.''   The crowd was small but enthusiastic, cheering the astronauts andtheir wives as they stepped off two NASA planes. After making briefremarks, the crew members spent several minutes shaking hands andhugging their friends and co-workers.   At Edwards, which was closed to the public because the flight wasclassified, only a few hundred journalists, NASA employees andinvited guests watched as Gibson guided the 97-ton shuttle to a 3:35p.m. PST touchdown on the packed clay runway in the Mojave Desert.   The landing time apparently was dictated by the orbit Atlantishad to follow in deploying the radar satellite. NASA prefers morninglandings at Edwards because winds tend to gather force later in theday.   Although NASA and the Air Force permitted live televisioncoverage of the landing, as they did for Friday's blastoff from CapeCanaveral, Fla., everything in between was blacked out.   About an hour after touchdown, the crew and several NASAofficials inspected the orbiter and NASA cameras showed undersidescarring to the shuttle, including ``dings'' to the black protectivetiles.   The damage to the tiles ``appeared to be a lot more'' than usual,NASA spokeswoman Nancy Lovato said.   Atlantis will remain at the base for several days for servicing.It then will be mounted on a modified jumbo jetliner for a piggybackride home to the Kennedy Space Center in Florida.   Atlantis' flight was the 27th shuttle mission and the secondsince the 1986 Challenger explosion that killed seven astronauts andhalted manned space missions for 32 months. It was the thirddedicated solely to the military.</TEXT></DOC>
