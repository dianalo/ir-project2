Critics suggested he was maneuvering to be allowed torun in the December elections.   Small groups of anti-government demonstrators battled withPinochet supporters in the downtown streets after the president'sspeech at a government office building. Police used water cannons tostop the fighting and there were no immediate reports of arrests orserious injuries.   Pinochet is the army commander who led the coup that ousted thegovernment of Marxist President Salvador Allende in Sepember 1973and he has headed the military government since then.   A constitution drafted by his government was enacted in 1981,barring a president from succeeding himself. Several opponents saidPinochet might consider some constitutional reforms in exchange foran amendment that would permit him to be a presidential candidate inthis year's balloting.   Pinochet said in his speech that ``the only intention thegovernment has in indicating its willingness to modify theconstitution is to perfect it.   ``Our aim is far from the intentions of those who want todismantle our institutional structure or those who think that thepresident who leads the country is acting with some hidden personalaim,'' he added.   After the speech he told a cheering crowd outside the buildingthat they should unite behind a candidate who would continue hispolicies.   Pinochet lost a referendum in October on a proposal to extend hisrule to 1997. The loss, by a vote of 3.9 million to 3.1 million,obliged him to call open elections scheduled for Dec. 14. He is tohand over power to the new government on March 11, 1990.   Pinochet said in the speech that he had instructed InteriorMinister Carlos Caceres to study several constitutional changesproposed by opposition groups.   He said he found ``worthy of study'' suggestions that wouldmodify an article banning Marxism, shorten the planned eight-yearpresidential term and eliminate the president's emergency power tosend citizens into exile.   Opponents said the changes are needed to ensure democracy when anelected government takes office. The amendments would have to beapproved in a national referendum.   Pinochet said he also would consider changes to shorten thepresidential term and erase the president's power to dissolve theHouse of Deputies and exile opponents.   Some opposition groups oppose the constitution's provision for apresidential term of eight years. Before the 1973 coup the presidentserved for six years.</TEXT></DOC>
