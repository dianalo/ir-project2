Near midday, contracts for May delivery of West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, stood at $18.81 per42-gallon barrel, up 44 cents from Friday's closing price on theNew York Mercantile Exchange.   Among refined products, May contracts for wholesale unleadedgasoline were up 1.04 cents at 53.65 cents per gallon, whilewholesale heating oil contracts were up 1.05 cents at 50.80 centsper gallon.   Mary T. Bergonia, an analyst at E.D.andamp; F. Man InternationalFutures Inc., said ``war talk'' was mainly responsible, as tradersworried that escalating hostilities in the Persian Gulf regionmight result in restrictions on supplies.   In Washington today, the White House said President Reagan hadstruck at Iranian oil platforms to punish Iran for the mine attackthat nearly sank a U.S. frigate and to warn the Iranians againstsowing new mines in the Persian Gulf.   The Pentagon said an Iranian navy frigate responded by firingmissiles at U.S. aircraft, while an Iranian guided missile patrolboat fired on the cruiser Wainwright. It added that the frigate wasattacked and set afire by U.S. planes and an American destroyer.   Aside from the war action, Ms. Bergonia said traders were also``nervous'' about a scheduled April 26 meeting between five membersof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and non-OPECproducers.   That meeting will be followed by a full conference byrepresentatives of all 13 nations in the cartel.   Any agreement to limit output could also send prices higher.   In addition, the analyst said, technical factors were alsosupporting the market.   Noting that the May crude contract will expire at the close oftrading Wednesday, she said traders believed that more industrybuying was likely before then.</TEXT></DOC>
