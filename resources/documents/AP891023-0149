KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Senate Republican Leader Bob Dole said Mondaythat President Bush is exercising necessary prudence in vowing tokeep some chemical arms in U.S. arsenals until all such weapons areeliminated worldwide.   But Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, in his thirdconsecutive speech on the issue, said the Bush's decisionrepresents a ``major step backward'' that ``can only result indelay and confusion'' at talks in Geneva aimed at banning chemicalarms.   Dole, responding to the criticism by Mitchell and otherDemocrats, said Bush only seeks to ``keep a deterrent, a modern andcredible deterrent, until we are certain there is worldwideparticipation in a treaty banning chemical weapons.''   ``It seems to me this is a reasonaable and responsible policy,''the Kansas Republican said.   Mitchell, D-Maine, noted that the U.S. position _ and that ofother Western powers _ has been that a global ban on the productionof chemical weapons would take effect soon after a treaty enteredinto force.   Mitchell complained there is evidence, contained in publishedreports not denied by the White House, that the United States willcontinue to produce modern chemical weapons for eight years or moreafter a treaty goes into effect, updating the chemical weaponsstockpile even as its overall size is reduced.   Disputes over Bush's policy could cause such delay at the Genevatalks ``that the opportunity to achieve progress on a global ban onchemical weapons will be lost, perhaps forever,'' Mitchell asserted.   ``The efforts of other countries to attain this capability willproceed, while the arms control process will be stalled as theresult of American indecision and inconsistency,'' he said.   But Dole argued tghat, ``We need some insurance in case we donot get worldwide participation. Keeping our chemical deterrentcredible will provide us with that insurance.''   ``As much as we may want to see arms control progress in thearea of chemical weapons and elsewhere, the United States needs tolook for action, not words, especially when U.S. national securityis involved,'' Dole said.   In an address to the United Nations Security Council last month,Bush announced that as part of a global treaty banning chemicalweapons the United States would reduce its stockpiles of suchweapons by 98 peercent over eight years if the Soviet Union did thesame.   The president said the United States would eliminate theremaining 2 percent at the 10th year, but only if all other nationshad eliminated their chemical weapons capability.   Shortly after Bush's speech, press reports quoted unnamedadministration officials as saying the United States would producemodern Bigeye chemical weapons throughout the reduction period tomake sure the reduced stocks of such arms are as potent as possible.   Mitchell referred to these reports and asked: ``How can theUnited States possibly expect other countries to observe a ban onproduction if we reserve to ourselves the right to ignore a ban?''   Mitchell said other nations would insist on such productionrights for themselves.   ``This means that verifying a chemical weapons ban, hard enoughunder the best of conditions, will become enormously moredifficult,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
