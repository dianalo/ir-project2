<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-1043 </DOCNO><TEXT>A method and an equipment have been developed and used for measurementof fiber emissions from corroded and weathered ACP. Emissions of fibrousdusts were measured on buildings with different types of AC-plates (roofingand facade shingles). The measured emission factors for asbestos fiberslonger than 5 {mu}m were in the range of 10/sup 6/ to 10/sup 8/ fibers/m/sup2/. They depended on the type of the AC-plates as well as on their ageand corrosion intensity. The measured concentrations of asbestos fibers(longer than 5 {mu}m) in ambient air in the vicinity of ACP were in therange of 50 to 1000 fibers/m/sup 3/. It could be shown in animal experimentsthat the carcinogenic potency of 'corroded' asbestos fibers did not differfrom the carcinogenicity of 'normal' standard chrysotil fibers.
