The advantages of such an interfaceover more conventional query interfaces are (1) expert systems can handlecertainty factors and (2) expert systems can explain their recommendationsand their requests for information. Such an interface can be designedfor use by persons who know nothing of the arrangement of the database.The advantages of the database approach to expert systems developmentare: (1) the decrease in development time and (2) the ease with whichthe system can be modified. This paper includes a description of an expertsystem for general reference that has been developed with currently availablesoftware for expert systems development and for database management.The advantages of this approach generalize to all expert systems thatassist humans in areas where the rules are well-established, but thedecisive information frequently changes. As is explained in the conclusion,this approach is best for the developer, the purchaser (who can customizethe expert system by modifying the database), and the end-user.</TEXT></DOC>
