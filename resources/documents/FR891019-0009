Thepurpose of the Improvements Act is to further the use of abandoned railroadrights-of-way for both recreational trail and conservation purposes.\2\<NOTE/> Section 3 of the Improvements Act, codified at 16 U.S.C.1248(c) <T3>et seq.</T3>, provides that in the event of future abandonments ofrailroad rights-of-way previously granted by the United States, the UnitedStates will retain whatever interests it may have in those rights-of-wayso that they may be managed for recreational trail purposes and other consistentuses.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Petitioners include Rails to Trails Conservancy, AmericanHiking Society, League of American Wheelmen, Heritage Trails Fund, AmericanTrails, American Horse Council, Minnesota Department of Natural Resources,and Washington State Parks and Recreation Commission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ H.R. Rep. No. 572, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., (1988); andS. Rep. No. 408, 100th Cong., 2d Sess., (1988).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ <T3>Id</T3>.Section 1248(c) is the focus of this proceeding. It provides:<ITAG tagnum="21">Commencing upon the date of enactment of this subsection, any andall right, title, interest, and estate of the United States in all rights-of-wayof the type described in the Act of March 8, 1922 (43 U.S.C. 912), shallremain in the United States upon the abandonment of forfeiture of suchrights-of-way, or portions thereof, except to the extent that any suchright-of-way, or portion thereof, is embraced within a public highway nolater than one year after a determination of abandonment or forfeiture,as provided under such Act. </ITAG>Sections 1248 (d) and (e) provide for the management and disposition ofreverted property. The U.S. Department of the Interior (Interior) is responsiblefor managing and disposing of reverted property. Petitioners suggest thatthe U.S. Department of Agriculture (Agriculture) also may have implementingresponsibilities. Petitioners argue that Interior and Agriculture will need help in identifying``section 1248(c) property'' and knowing when that property is being abandoned.According to petitioners, neither Interior nor Agriculture has informationor information retrieval systems capable of giving them such informationin a timely fashion within budget constraints. Because this Commissionregulates rail line abandonments, petitioners maintain that we could helpInterior and Agriculture in this regard. Petitioners recommend variousmodifications of the Commission's environmental regulations, codified at49 CFR part 1105, as set forth in detail in our decision. We seek comments from all interested parties, especially from both Agricultureand Interior describing their roles in implementing the Improvements Actand how we can assist. It will be helpful to us to understand: (1) Whatresources Interior and Agriculture have marshalled to date to implementsection 1248(c); (2) the process Interior will use to reclaim affectedproperty; and (3) how the proposed notice and title information would beused. While we are not proposing specific rules, all parties are placed on noticethat, following receipt of comments, we intend to adopt final rules. Weseek to develop rules that meet implementation needs but at the same timeminimize the burden on the industry to the extent possible.\4\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Petitioners state that because their proposed amendmentsrelate to the Commission's environmental regulations implemented by theCommission's Section of Energy and Environment, they have informally discussedthem with the staff of that Section. According to petitioners, they havebeen advised that the Section has no objection to the proposed amendmentsand foresees no additional significant burden upon itself in terms of implementingthe proposals. <ITAG tagnum="28">However, the Commission's Section of Energy and Environment deniesthat it has made any statements or agreement or has given any assurancesregarding the merits of petitioners' proposals. In any event, it wouldnot have been appropriate for that office to have provided any opinionin these matters. </ITAG>Additional information is contained in the Commission's decision.

This action will not significantly affect either the quality of the humanenvironment or conservation of energy resources. Adopted rules would appear to have no significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities because only minor notice and informational requirementswould be involved, and most of the involved carriers do not qualify assmall entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR part 1105 </ITAG>Environmental impact statements, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR part 1152 </ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Conservation, Environmental protection,National forests, National parks, National trails system, National resources,Public lands_grants, Public lands_rights-of-way, Railroads, Recreationand recreation areas, and Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 553, 16 U.S.C. 1248(c); and 49 U.S.C. 10321,10505, 10903, and 10904.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Decided: October 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission, Chairman Gradison, Vice Chairman Simmons, CommissionersAndre, Lamboley, and Phillips. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Noreta R.
