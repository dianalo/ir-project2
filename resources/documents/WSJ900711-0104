Part of this article is devoted to an examination of theadjustment to teenage childbearing among our small subgroupof second-generation adolescent mothers compared with that oftheir mothers in 1970. An earlier analysis had suggested thatmany of the older generation of mothers would fare reasonablywell over the long term. Is the prognosis for the daughtersequally favorable? The early indications are not encouraging.More of the daughters were unmarried, and most expected toremain single in the near future. Because of this propensityto remain single, a far greater proportion of the youngergeneration were receiving public assistance. In addition,indications that they would leave welfare were lessencouraging. Although the daughters had higher educationalgoals, more had a history of having failed a grade -- anominous sign for future educational attainment. Moreover, ahigher proportion of teenage mothers were neither employednor in school. . . . We must wonder whether these findingsportend the growth of an urban underclass.   In addressing this point, however, we need to recognizesome countervailing trends. First, the great majority ofoffspring of teenage mothers are not repeating the pattern oftheir parents. Overall, out-of-wedlock teenage childbearingin the black population has not increased over the past twodecades; indeed, it has dropped slightly since the early1970s, no doubt in part because of the legalization ofabortion.   Second, the availability of abortion has changed thecomposition of the teenage-parent population. Once pregnancyoccurs, fewer teenagers today are forced to become parents,making early parenthood (relatively speaking) more avoluntary act. Although abortion is undoubtedly underreportedin our sample, we strongly suspect that more educationallycompetent teenagers opt out of parenthood. Compared withteenagers who became mothers before age 19, those who hadaborted a pregnancy were much less likely to have previouslyrepeated a grade in school and held higher educationalaspirations. . . .   Although the picture of the second-generation teenagemother is bleak, there is an encouraging side to ourfindings. Most of the teenage children of the originalBaltimore mothers did not become teenage parents themselves.Of those teenagers without children, most had completed highschool, and many went on to college. No doubt, despite greatefforts, some will be unable to lift themselves out ofpoverty . . . but it is equally possible that the toeholdinto the middle class they are now establishing will growfirmer.</TEXT></DOC>
