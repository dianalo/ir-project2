Sudanese and Western experts agree he needs to come up withsolutions, and soon. Otherwise, they fear a return of streetviolence like that which gripped the country for four days last week.   Many Sudanese believe Mahdi allowed the war and the economicproblems to drag on too long, taking no decisive action until thecourse of events pushed him into it.   What finally turned the streets into arenas of broken glass andburning barricades was Mahdi's imposition of steep price increasesat a time when unrest already seethed over his refusal to endorseofficially a draft peace agreement negotiated by a coalition partner.   ``What we need is action,'' said Mohamed Omer Beshir, a veteranpolitical observer and lecturer at Khartoum University's Instituteof African and Asian Studies. ``We need any action to stop the war.   ``Every day of the war makes the economic situation worse, and ifthings get worse, the people will not stay silent. They will react.''   But Beshir doesn't expect new demonstrations right away.   ``The prime minister ... doesn't have the support of the peopleany more,'' Beshir said. ``But as for demonstrations again, notnecessarily. Things in Sudan aren't always that logical.''   A Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, wasn't sosure.   ``It's basically an explosive situation,'' he said. ``The reasonsthe people took to the streets last week still are there. While thesituation might be dormant today, it could reignite any time.''   Last week's trouble followed smaller food riots late last yearand severe and widespread criticism of Mahdi because he refused toendorse the peace agreement. It was signed Nov. 16 by the DemocraticUnionist Party and Sudan People's Liberation Army and followedseveral failed efforts by Mahdi to come to terms with the rebels.   Despite support for the agreement from across the Sudanesepolitical spectrum except for the fundamentalist National IslamicFront, Mahdi stalled until too late to convene a constitutionalpeace conference Dec. 31, as the agreement required. The DemocraticUnionists quit the coalition.   Most observers in Sudan see Mahdi's refusal to act on the peaceagreement was an attempt to satisfy the fundamentalist coalitionpartner at the expense of the centrist Democratic Unionists.   The Islamic Front flatly rejected the pact because it wouldfreeze the country's legal code, which is based on Islam's1,350-year-old code of ethics and laws by which Moslems are supposedto live.   ``El-Mahdi is like someone trying to ride two horses. No oneknows how long he can keep this up,'' said Beshir. ``We needimmediate action, but it doesn't look like el-Mahdi will provide itsoon.''   As tensions built, the prime minister announced that salarieswere being increased by up to 500 percent, then followed the newstwo days later with steep price increases on sugar and cigarettesand a 15 percent sales tax on locally manufactured commodities.   ``If the people had been hopeful on peace, maybe the governmentwould have gotten away with the price increases,'' the Westerndiplomat said. ``This way, they just made the people too angry tosit and take it any more.''   The street violence enticed the government to roll back the priceincreases and make the salary increases retroactive to July 1, andthe disturbances slowly stopped.   ``It was all very Sudanese to see how things all went back tonormal on Saturday, with the usual terrible traffic and people attheir desks,'' said the diplomat. ``It looked like all hell hadbroken loose on Thursday, and there was chaos.''   Indicative of restiveness in the army was that the generalsrefused to honor Mahdi's request that they intervene to help policeput down the trouble.   ``The military refused to get involved,'' said a Western militarysource. ``The price increases affected the military as well, andthey didn't like it a bit.''   The foreign expert said the Sudanese military viewed thetentative agreement as ``a means to end the war, but Sadek didn'ttake it.   The current government is the third reshuffle since Mahdi waselected in April 1986, after Mahdi brought in the National IslamicFront last year as a counter to his traditional enemy, theDemocratic Unionists.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Dalia Baligh is based in Cairo, Egypt, and makesfrequent news-gathering trips to Sudan.</TEXT></DOC>
