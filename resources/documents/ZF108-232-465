(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>AA embarks on $150-million integration effortandM;Many companies talk about improving productivity and cutting costs by lettingemployees easily get at and work with data located throughout the enterprise.andO;American Airlines Inc. is one corporation striving to make that vision areality with a systems integration project that will ultimately give its72,000 employees access to data spread among three interlinked networks.andM;Two of the networks are SABRE (Semi-Automated Business Research Environment)and the Commercial Systems network; both have long been used at American.andM;The third network, a $150-million two-year project dubbed InterAAct, is thefocus of American's current project and is configured with equipment andapplications software from different vendors.andP;  InterAAct is initially beingmade available to some 14,000 management and business professionals, who areexpected to be the most intensive users of the system.andM;The backbone through which data from all three networks will pass is anX.25-based, private, packet-switching system.andP;  This system is currently beingimplemented along with InterAAct.andP;  The project is guided by American's SABREComputer Services Div.andP;  (SCS), which is the company's internal systemsintegrator.andM;SABRE is, itself, the world's largest privately owned, real-time computernetwork, according to American.andP;  The SABRE computer reservation systemconnects more than 160,000 computer terminals, ticket printers, boarding passprinters and other devices in American facilities and 14,000 travel agenciesaround the world.andP;  Within American Airlines, SABRE's Flight Operating System(FOS) is also used for handling aircraft and crew schedules, weather data,flight plans, spare parts inventory and other fleet operations information.andM;The Commercial Systems network handles such things as schedule analysis forthe airline and provides an environment for users to develop and test theacceptability of new SABRE application programs.andM;InterAAct, when completed, could comprise the largest corporate informationfacility in the private sector outside of those used by computermanufacturers themselves, American believes.andP;  Desktop machines based on IntelCorp.'s 80386 and 80386/SX microprocessors are being supplied to the systemby ATandamp;T Co., IBM Corp. and Tandy Corp.andP;  It is likely that any one vendor'sshare would be at least 10 percent of the 50,000 workstations Americanintends to purchase for use in this project and for installation in SABRETravel Information Network travel agencies.andM;Employees using InterAAct can access a variety of software applications withthe NewWave graphical user interface from Hewlett-Packard Co.andP;  NewWave itselfruns on top of Microsoft Corp.'s Windows.andP;  Applications available throughInterAAct include word processing, electronic mail, spreadsheet, database andforms-entry programs.andP;  Desktops, file servers and departmental processors areconnected within workgroups by Novell Inc. token-ring LANs based on the IEEE802.5 standard.andM;Eicon Technology Corp. gateways and Northern Telecom Inc. packet switchesfacilitate interconnection of InterAAct to the other networks via the X.25wide-area system.andM;Toward decentralizationandM;Two points have driven American's creation of InterAAct and its integrationwith existing networks.andP;  &quot;Even though we depend on information systems todrive our business, employees, prior to InterAAct, had a hodgepodge ofterminals on their desks,&quot; says Max Hopper, senior vice president forinformation systems at American.andP;  &quot;There was no common way of performingbusiness tasks.andP;  There were pieces of a system here and there, but nothingthat was fully standardized across the corporation and that kept up with theoffice-automation functions we needed.andP;  This situation was not conducive toimproving productivity.&quot;andM;Moreover, American realized that changes in the way information was accessedcould favorably impact the management philosophy it was seeking.andO;Historically, according to Hopper, airlines have been centrally managed.andO;This style, however, was seen as increasingly unsuitable to a companyanticipating a 60 percent growth in the number of its employees and a 60percent increase in the number of aircraft in its fleet.andP;  American wanted todrive decisionmaking capabilities lower in the organization and to givemanagers more of a coordination role.andP;  &quot;A manager shouldn't have to look overeveryone's shoulder all the time,&quot; says Hopper.andM;InterAAct provides American with the office tools, communications links andinformation base it needs to make decentralized management a reality.andP;  At thesame time, the company has initiated &quot;Committing to Leadership&quot; classesthroughout the work force that encourage teamwork.andM;At one of these workshops, an employee came up with a statement thatexpresses American's goal for InterAAct: &quot;We plan to create an environmentwhere all employees have at their fingertips immediate access and controlover whatever information they require to effectively do their jobs.&quot;andM;Off-the-shelf flyingandM;American intends to build InterAAct with off-the-shelf products to themaximum extent possible.andP;  System planning began two years ago with theestablishment of an Office Automation Task Force composed of departmentalusers and information systems staff.andP;  This group analyzed user-applicationneeds that resulted in a request for proposals sent to four office-automationvendors.andM;&quot;No one vendor met all our needs, but HP fulfilled more of our requirementsthan anybody else,&quot; says Wayne Pendleton, managing director of informationsystems technology at SCS and project manager for InterAAct.andP;  &quot;A big part ofthe award [decision] was based on the functionality and networkingcapabilities of HP's DeskManager electronic mail product,&quot; he says.andO;DeskManager incorporates electronics-forms management, calendaring andresource scheduling, among other features.andM;In addition, American felt that HP's strategic direction toward openarchitecture and industry standards lined up with its own plans, including astrong interest by American in the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model.andM;HP's NewWave interface was not part of the company's original proposal.andO;American, however, added it to their InterAAct product mix after evaluating apre-release version.andP;  &quot;We think NewWave represents the direction in whichoffice automation is going,&quot; contends information chief Hopper.andP;  &quot;It offersan easy-to-use, consistent way to access and update an integrated suite ofbusiness functions, as well as to schedule routine tasks for the computer tocarry out.andP;  Training time and costs are also lower with such a system.&quot;andM;NewWave's basic concept is to provide an electronic-office desk.andP;  AnInterAAct user sitting at one of the 80386-based machines sees a number oficons on the screen symbolizing different tasks.andP;  Any number of theseWindows-compatible applications can be opened at the same time.andP;  Among themare DeskManager, Microsoft's Excel spreadsheet, the Paradox 3 databasepackage from Borland International Inc., Lotus Development Corp.'s Freelancegraphics program and a pre-release word-processing program.andM;Employees can also access on-line versions of American's phone directory andemployee manual.andP;  Eventually, personnel information and all four volumes ofcompany policies and procedures will be on the system.andP;  In addition, theSABRE and Commercial Systems networks are represented by icons, enablingusers to switch quickly between InterAAct and these systems.andM;Other NewWave features attractive to American were object management androutine-task automation.andP;  Object management lets users create compounddocuments from different types of material such as word-processing, graphicsand spreadsheet programs.andP;  Objects may be reprsented on screen by icons forfuture use.andM;Moreover, NewWave can generate cross-application macros, called &quot;agents.&quot;andO;These record routine tasks performed by the user and then carry them outautomatically as scheduled.andP;  A typical agent macro function might be to signonto a host computer, download data, bring it into a document and mail thedocument.andM;The Novell LANandM;Work groups within InterAAct are interconnected by Novell LANs using theNetware 2.15 operating system.andP;  The choice of Novell was almost a given,since use of Netwre by American and by travel agents in the SABRE networkmake American Novell's largest customer.andP;  &quot;I asked our staff why we shouldn'tuse Novell,&quot; says Hopper.andP;  &quot;They found no economic justification to turn toanother system, with all the retrofitting that would have been involved.andP;  Wealso found Novell software easily serviceable.&quot;andM;Departmental machines and file servers are hooked into most InterAAct LANs,along with the desktops.andP;  Users obtain basic application software, includingword-processing, spreadsheet and database management programs, from the fileservers, which are 80386-based computers.andP;  The electronic mail system resideson the departmental processors, HP 3000 Model 70 and HP Micro 3000GX devices.andO;American intends to upgrade these machines to HP Precision Architecturesystsems over the next year.andM;HP does not yet support a direct connection between its Office Share protocolon the 3000 family and Novell's token-ring LAN.andP;  Most InterAAct LANs, thus,use dedicated 80386 machines carrying HP protocol conversion software asbridges to the HP computers.andM;X.25 has international standingandM;The X.25, packet-switching wide-area network (WAN) being installed tointerconnect InterAAct, SABRE and Commercial Systems will use 14 largeregional nodes already in place.andP;  Each node contains multiplexers fromNetwork Equipment Technology.andP;  Another 100, smaller local nodes are beingadded to accommodate traffic generated by InterAAct.andP;  Northern Telecom'sDPN-100 packet switches serve both large and small nodes.andM;&quot;American favors X.25 as a packet-transport protocol because we are a globalcompany,&quot; says Bill Jewell, managing director of communications engineeringat American.andP;  Jewell notes that the airline and SABRE already have asignificant presence in Europe, Australia and Japan.andP;  &quot;We need aninterconnect facility that matches our international ambitions.andP;  X.25 is alogical choice because of its widespread use outside the U.S.andP;  We also likeX.25 because it is not tied to any one specific vendor.andP;  It can be used inconjunction with multiple suppliers.&quot;andM;Data enters local nodes of the X.25 system at speeds of up to 9.6K bits persecond (bps).andP;  Using multiplexing technology, a process for interweavingtechnology, a process for interweaving information from multiple datachannels into a higher speed pipeline, these nodes send data out at 56K bpsto the regional packet transmission sites.andP;  The latter, in turn, gatherstogether enough 56K-bps data streams to transmit information among themselvesat T1 (1.544M bits per second) and multiple T1 speeds.andP;  The reverse happenswhen data reenters the receiving nodes.andM;This system has also been configured so that any one large or small node cantalk to a minimum of two other similarly sized nodes.andP;  Thus, in case a nodegoes down, data can always be sent to an alternative location.andM;Opening the gateandM;The final component of InterAAct is Eicon Technology's Access/QLLC (QualifiedLogical Link Control) communications gateway.andP;  QLLC is IBM's process fortransferring information from Systems Network Architecture environmentsacross X.25 networks.andP;  Within InterAAct, Access/QLLC connects the Novell LANsto SNA-based host computers in the SABRE and Commercial Systems networks viathe X.25 packet-switched system.andM;As hardware, Access/QLLC is an intelligent communications adapter card placedin a dedicated desktop machine located on each LAN.andP;  With the appropriatesoftware, this product, for example, controls the X.25 link and emulates IBM3270 and Digital Equipment Corp. VT100 terminals.andP;  By accessing the gateway,LAN users can communicate with remote hosts, databases and other LANs.andP;  Inaddition, a user can establish up t nine concurrent sessions, eachcommunicating with a different SNA or ASCII host.andM;In some InterAAct locations, there may not be enough people to warrant havingan HP 3000 on-site, although installation of a LAN can be justified.andP;  In thiscase, according to Pendleton, an Eicon gateway is used to tap an off-site HPmachine through the X.25 network.andM;For sites that are too small even for a LAN, the gate adapter card is placedin a standalone desktop, along with other office-automation software.andP;  Eicondoes not yet have a version for laptops, but American intends to give thesedevices access to the X.25 system as well.andM;&quot;No matter which configuration is in place, the InterAAct user sees nodifference when it comes to opening applications, whether they are on thelocal file server, SABRE or Commercial Systems,&quot; says Pendelton.andP;  &quot;Everythinglooks, feels and acts the same.&quot;andP;  Moreover, American's existing proceduresfor maintaining data security and integrity remain unchanged.andM;Network in operationandM;When someone on InterAAct wishes to communicate with Commercial Systems, datafrom the desktop is first sent to the gateway.andP;  Emulating a 3270 terminal,the Eicon system takes the data stream and translates it into a 3270 protocolwithin an X.25 envelope.andP;  &quot;As a transportation process, X.25 doesn't carewhat particular protocol it is carrying,&quot; says Pendleton.andP;  &quot;It just sendspackets.&quot;andP;  The data is then shipped across the X.25 network.andP;  Each packetswitch along the way looks at the package to determine the appropriateaddress before transmitting it to the next switch.andM;Once on the Commercial Systems side, the X.25 package enters an IBM 37X5machine used as a front-end processor to SNA host computers.andP;  The NetworkPackaging System Interface (NPSI)--IBM software running on top of the 37X5'sNetwork Control Program (NCP) operating system--removes the X.25 envelope andthen turns the data back into a 3270 nativemode format.andM;This information is passed to host machines for interaction with IBMapplications running on MVS or VM.andP;  These include Information ManagementSystem (IMS), a data-communications program; Data Base Two (DB2), adatabase-management package; and Time Sharing Option (TSO), used here as aprogram-development environment and interface to DB2.andM;A parallel route is taken by data traveling from InterAAct to SABRE.andO;Emulating a VT100 terminal, the Eicon product packages a VT100 data stream inan X.25 envelope.andP;  At the SABRE side of the X.25 network, the data enters aDigital VAX computer.andP;  This machine is generally used to interconnectnon-SABRE networks and reservation systems to SABRE processors.andP;  In thismode, the VAX, for example, allows a SABRE user to log on to anotherairline's reservation sysstem using SABRE commands.andM;In the context of InterAAct-SABRE communications, the VAX converts the VT100format packaged within the X.25 protocol into the protocol used by SABRE.andO;The data is then handed off to computers from ICL North America BusinessSystems (formerly called Computer Consoles Inc.).andP;  These computers act asfront-end processors for the linked IBM 3090-200E mainframes which form thecore of SABRE.andP;  Thanks to this process, the desktop initiating thetransmission looks like a SABRE terminal to the SABRE system.andM;American anticipates many benefits from installation of InterAAct and theX.25 network.andM;For one thing, the powerful InterAAct platforms provide a framework foradding future workstation products that can be encapsulated within theNewWave interface.andP;  The X.25 network could also underpin any migration to OSIundertaken by American.andP;  &quot;OSI standards such as the X.400 Message HandlingSystem and X.500 Directory Services are among the capabilities that we mayutilize down the road,&quot; says Pendleton.andM;American also expects certain quantitative and qualitative improvements toflow because of InterAAct and its window to the existing networks.andP;  &quot;We didtime-and-motion measurements of how routine office tasks were carried outbefore beginning implementation of the new system,&quot; says Max Hopper.andP;  &quot;Thesestudies will be followed up every six months for the next few years to verifythat what we expect is happening and to indicate any areas of networkoperation or workstation functionality that need improving.andP;  You don't wantto wait until the project is completed to get back on course.&quot;andM;As a result of its initial study, American expects that productivity ofmanagement and clerical employees will increase approximately 7 percent.andP;  Anadditional 2 percent increase in productivity should stem from improvedaccess by employees to data and on-line reporting programs.andP;  Reduction inpaper flow and telephone expenses, elimination of internal company telephonetag, need for less filing space and savings in overnight freight are amongthe cost and time savings and mroe efficient use of resources that areexpected.andM;Moreover, American looks forward to continual improvements in customerservice stemming from the wider access to corporate information thatemployees will enjoy.andP;  &quot;We feel that employees should not be constrained bythe in formation they need to get the job done,&quot; say Hopper.andP;  &quot;Employees arelikely to be happier when they have the tools to deal with customers quicklyand easily, and don't have to worry about what the computer is actually doingto obtain needed information.andP;  When our people feel better about how they aredoing their jobs, customers benefit.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
