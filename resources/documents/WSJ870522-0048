Alan Cranston (D., Calif.).    &quot;Please keep these letters off the record,&quot; he smiles wryly. &quot;I'd hate for my friends to find out about them.&quot;    House Armed Services Committee Chairman Les Aspin (D., Wis.) also finds himself in a dilemma of being at odds with many of his left-leaning House colleagues. He is now raising serious questions about accepting a Soviet offer to remove nuclear missiles from Europe -- a concept he supported without reservation in 1981.    Sneers conservative Mr. Adelman about Rep. Aspin's change of heart: &quot;Les Aspin had six years to decide whether or not he liked the bacon. It's a little late in the day to be going kosher.&quot;    The usual left-right division over U.S.-Soviet relations has been thrown into ideological chaos by the debate over whether to accept Moscow's offer to remove all medium-range and short-range missiles from Europe. Many U.S. anti-communists are lining up with European socialists in favor of this Intermediate Nuclear Force (INF) agreement. Some liberal Democrats in the U.S. are siding with West German conservatives against it. And former detente boosters Henry Kissinger and Richard Nixon claim President Reagan's Pentagon hard-liners are backing an agreement that &quot;could create the most profound crisis of the NATO (North Atlantic Treaty Organization) alliance in its 40-year history.&quot;    One of the most mystifying twists is that Richard Perle, until this month the assistant secretary of defense for international security matters, is suddenly pushing hard for an agreement after six years of being considered the most articulate arms-control skeptic.    &quot;It is because he invented it, because it doesn't include strategic weapons and because he despises the Europeans,&quot; says Henry Kissinger about Mr. Perle, a man who had been one of the most relentless critics of Mr. Kissinger's own arms-control efforts when Mr. Perle was an aide to Democratic Sen. Henry Jackson in the 1970s. &quot;I don't see any benefit we get out of this projected agreement.&quot;    The public's confusion over the arcane arms-control debate has been made even worse by the lack of any coherent and clearly understood sides to the debate.    &quot;This agreement, like policies toward the Middle East and attitudes about aid to Poland during the Solidarity days, is an issue that cuts across ideological lines,&quot; says Mr. Adelman. But while left-right arguments over the Middle East are confused by views toward Arabs and Jews, and giving money to Poland was a question of how best to promote change during a critical period, the arms-control picture isn't as easy to categorize.    Positions are determined by personal ambitions, unease about Soviet motives, disagreements over the validity of European concerns, and the general incomprehensibility of arms-control matters.    Some political analysts say the problem is a lack of purpose within both the left and the right. The detente approach to the Soviets was ruled out by President Carter's experience with the Afghanistan invasion in 1979, and President Reagan's compromise with Congress over MX missile deployment and promotion of a nuclear-free world has disoriented the anti-Soviet right.    &quot;No one can organize the arguments so we can't agree on anything,&quot; says Larry K. Smith, who teaches national security subjects at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. Policy makers &quot;don't agree on whether we need SDI (Strategic Defense Initiative) or what it should or can do, we don't agree on arms control and we don't agree on why we need nuclear weapons. All we have with INF is a general confusion being acted out in a particular issue. The policy community can't make sense of it anymore.&quot;    Mr. Adelman says that what divides the right is its distrust of any agreement with the Soviets weighed against the possibility of getting the Soviets to give up far more weaponry than the West and prove President Reagan's hard line was the proper policy.    The left doesn't want to abandon its support of arms control, but it also refuses to accept any Reagan success as unalloyed. Some Democrats and Republicans fear that removing the U.S. missiles would decouple Washington and Europe, while others believe it would give the Europeans a needed shock that would prompt them to do more to ensure their own security.    Sen. Majority leader Robert Byrd (D., W.Va.), who set arms control as one of his top priorities, is curiously cautious in his support. Congressional staff members say he wants to dispel the Democrats' soft-on-the-Soviets image by showing a willingness to question arms-control agreements and wants to raise enough doubts about this particular deal so its success won't generate too much enthusiasm for the Republicans as election year nears.    &quot;The Democrats don't want people misled into thinking this was any major breakthrough in arms control,&quot; says Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control Association, who headed the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency under President Carter.    Some hard-liners may even be tempted into supporting this relatively limited agreement on nuclear weapons as a way of distracting arms-control proponents from Mr. Reagan's strategic defense plans. West German parliamentarian Karsten Voigt, long a friend of Mr. Perle despite his left-wing Social Democratic credentials, ventures: &quot;Richard may view it as throwing meat to the arms-control dogs to satisfy their appetites.&quot;    Mr. Perle objects to Mr. Kissinger's and Mr. Voigt's suspicions. &quot;None of that is true. The key thing is what the Soviets are giving up. However this comes out I would put this arms-control agreement against any other negotiation in the last 20 years as a model for protecting Western interests.&quot; He says opponents of Ronald Reagan are &quot;eating their words&quot; because despite the president's space-defense plans, abrogation of the SALT II treaty and generally tough attitude toward Moscow, the Soviets are offering to give up more missiles in Europe than was previously thought possible.    Mr. Smith of the Kennedy School suggests that Mr. Perle could have two possible motives: He may want to reach an agreement to &quot;validate his life's history&quot; of believing the best way to deal with the Soviets is through strength and patience. Or he may still want to block an agreement by raising an endless number of objections on matters such as verification&quot;the politics of the detail.&quot;    Mr. Perle's support for the agreement clearly has confused conservatives, whose instinct has been to oppose arms control. &quot;A lot of people here feel if Richard is for it, it can't be all that bad,&quot; says Burton Pines, senior vice president of the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank.    And many conservatives are delighted that President Reagan is shaking up status-quo thinking on European security, because many of them think the U.S. is doing too much and its allies too little for Western defense.    ---   Intermediate and Short-Range Nuclear Missiles in Europe  Country Missile Type               Deployed       Sched.
