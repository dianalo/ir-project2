Without Soviet help, it may be difficult for the Bushadministration to extricate itself from northern Iraq. TheU.S. wants to replace its troops protecting Kurdish refugeesthere with a United Nations force. However, that couldrequire a U.N. Security Council resolution, and Moscow, asone of the five permanent members of the council, could blocksuch action. The Soviets, beset by domestic unrest of theirown, aren't eager to approve U.N. involvement in a nation'sinternal affairs.</LP><TEXT>   Asked whether Moscow would support a new U.N. resolution,Soviet Foreign Minister Alexander Bessmertnykh said after ameeting here yesterday with Mr. Baker that there is &quot;a thinline that separates the necessity for humanitarian supportand the concerns for the sovereignty of a country.&quot; He saidthat he and Mr. Baker are &quot;going to be in touch on thatfurther.&quot;   Mr. Baker said, &quot;It is very important, in our view, thatthe United Nations and other international relief agenciescome into northern Iraq and pick up the responsibility forhumanitarian relief for the Kurdish population there.&quot;   On Friday, before he left Washington to begin his currentMideast trip, Mr. Baker said the U.S. might seek a U.N.resolution authorizing an international force to protect theKurds from Saddam Hussein's Iraqi government forces. But inaddition to the Soviet Union, China is likely to be reluctantto approve such a measure, out of concern it could set aprecedent for U.N. involvement in Tibet. The other threepermanent Security Council members are the U.S., Britain andFrance.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar toldPresident Bush last week that Iraq had rejected a U.S.-backedproposal to dispatch a U.N. civilian police force to northernIraq. The U.S. believes a civilian force, unlike a militarypeacekeeping force, could be sent to Iraq without adoption ofa new U.N. resolution. But the U.N. official told Mr. Bushthat without Iraq's acquiescence, a resolution would berequired to establish even a police force.   The administration dispatched troops to northern Iraq lastmonth to encourage the return of Kurdish refugees, who hadfled their country after Saddam Hussein brutally ended theirrebellion against Baghdad. President Bush, fearing that theU.S. could become bogged down in Iraq's domestic turmoilafter routing Iraqi forces from Kuwait in the Persian Gulfwar, sent U.S. forces there reluctantly, hoping they would bereplaced quickly by international forces.   In their meeting here, Messrs. Baker and Bessmertnykhdiscussed a wide range of issues, including the prospects fora superpower summit this summer. Mr. Baker said that &quot;whetheror not there can be a summit by the middle of the summer willdepend, of course, on progress&quot; in arms-control issues. TheSoviets' top military official, Gen. Mikhail Moiseyev, isexpected to come to Washington next week to try to resolve adispute that is blocking completion of a conventional armspact.</TEXT></DOC>
