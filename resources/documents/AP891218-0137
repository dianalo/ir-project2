The three students and a disabled father of four were arrestedFriday at their homes in Manchester, police said. Under the act,suspects can be held seven days without charge.   ``The police have told me very little, but the men are under theimpression they have been arrested because they are suspected ofbeing a hit squad to kill Salman Rushdie,'' attorney Zahir Azizsaid.   Moslems worldwide have mounted protests against the Britishauthor and his novel, ``The Satanic Verses.'' The Indian-bornRushdie was condemned to death Feb. 14 by the late Iranian leaderAyatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who accused him of blaspheming Islamin his novel.   Rushdie has been in hiding ever since under police protection.   Friday's arrests put in jeopardy tentative steps to improveAnglo-Iranian relations and restore diplomatic links severed overthe Rushdie affair.   The detainees' lawyer identified the students as Karen Abrinia,32; Mehrdad Kokabi, 33; and Hussein Gharibi. No age was immediatelyavailable for Gharibi.   The attorney asked that the fourth man, 40-year-old JavadMousavi, who suffers from multiple sclerosis, be moved from hispolice cell to a hospital.   A Manchester police spokeswoman, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, refused to say why the suspects were detained.   However, she said the detentions were not connected to the U.S.State Department's warning last week of a possible terrorist attackon a U.S. target in Western Europe or West Africa.   Patrick Stephenson, registrar at the University of ManchesterInstitute of Science and Technology, said Kokabi and Abrinia wereengineering students who had completed their course work for doctorof philosophy degrees and were writing dissertations. It was notknown where Gharibi studies.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency on Friday quotedthe Iranian newspaper Kayhan as saying the arrests followeddemonstrations by Moslems in more than 1,000 mosques throughoutBritain against Rushdie.   Press Association, Britain's domestic news agency, said policeactivity in Manchester is believed to have intensified following astormy meeting there on Oct. 21 to celebrate the birthday of theIslamic prophet Mohammed. At that session, hard-line Moslems votedoverwhelmingly to support the call for Rushdie's execution.   Kayhan was quoted as saying police broke into the homes of thefour Iranians ``without producing any legal warrants, and, afterthe unauthorized search of their homes, forcibly took them intocustody.''   The Manchester police spokeswoman refused to comment when askedabout the warrants.   English-born Dawn Mousavi said police came to the family's homein Manchester on Friday afternoon and arrested her husband.   ``We were kept in the kitchen for two hours while the policesearched the house. They took away personal papers like letters andeven bank books. They turned everything upside down and took thefloorboards up,'' she said.   ``Javad is innocent. I don't know why he is detained. He is nota politically active person _ although we both support the Iraniangovernment,'' Mrs. Mousavi said.</TEXT></DOC>
