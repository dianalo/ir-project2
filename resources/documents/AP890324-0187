Yiannis Mantzouranis, former secretary to the Cabinet, told aninvestigating magistrate that fugitive banker George Koskotas hadbribed a former minister to the premier, Agamemnon Koutsogiorgas, tohelp cover up financial wrongdoings at his bank.   Mantzouranis was an associate of Koskotas.   In another development, Theofanis Tobras, the Public TelephoneCorporation's general manager, was jailed after testifying beforeanother magistrate investigating the Koskotas affair.   Koutsogiorgas, a close friend of Papandreou's for 25 years, hasstrongly denied any involvement in the scandal. No judicial actionhas been taken against him so far. He resigned his post last week.   Koskotas, the former chairman of the Bank of Crete, fled GreeceNovember 6 after being indicted in the $200 million fraud, forgeryand embezzlement scandal. He was arrested in the United States andis awaiting an extradition hearing.   In interviews from jail in Salem, Mass., Koskotas claimed thatPapandreou, Koutsogiorgas and other officials received millions ofdollars in payoffs and authorized the bank fraud.   Mantzouranis, who was the banker's lawyer, was arrested March 9and charged with accepting stolen money from Koskotas.   Mantzouranis made the accusations during a second day oftestimony before Giorgos Skarlatos, the magistrate investigating thescandal.   ``The course of the investigation has shown that Koutsogiorgasbears responsibilities for this crime,'' Mantzouranis' lawyer,Filipos Damoflis, told reporters after his client testifed for 10hours.   He added that the judicial investigation should be finished andsent to Parliament for examination.   Under the Greek Constitution, Parliament is the only body thatcan appoint a special judicial panel to investigate wrongdoingsperpetrated by acting or former ministers.   The scandal has prompted both Conservative and Communistopposition parties to call for Papandreou's resignation.   In his written testimony, leaked to the press, Mantzouranis saidhe arranged to deposit $2 million in a Swiss bank as payment toKoutsogiorgas for a special secrecy act that stifled an audit of theBank of Crete in July 1988.   ``I opened an account ... in three names. Mine, Mr.Koutsogiorgas' and in the name of his son Dimitris Koutsogiorgas,''said the testimony, which included the purported bank account number.   Tobras was charged with breach of faith for depositing $12.5million in the Bank of Crete last summer.   He became the fourth manager of a public corporation to be jailedfor depositing large amounts of money in the bank at lower thannormal interest rates when it was suffering from a cash-flow problem.   Among the corporations are Olympic Airways and the post office.   Tobras, a Socialist, has in the past been charged with tappingthe telephones of opposition parties and using firearms to harrassjournalists. He has not yet been tried on the charges.</TEXT></DOC>
