The Rainbow Warrior yacht was sent by Operation Greenpeace tolead a flotilla protesting French nuclear testing in the SouthPacific. French agents mined the ship July 10, 1985. The RainbowWarrior sank and a Portuguese-born Dutch photographer who wasaboard was killed.   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, saidarbitration before a tribunal begins Tuesday. They said they expectthe arbitration to be wrapped up by the weekend, but the decisionwill not be announced until later.   The tribunal met on Monday but only to discuss proceduralmatters, said a New Zealand official, speaking privately.   New Zealand says France violated a 1986 agreement meditated bySecretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar by letting two Frenchagents convicted in the bombing leave detention before their termsended.   Uruguayan law professor Eduardo Jiminez de Arechaga heads thepanel, which also consists of French appointee Jean-Denis Bredinand New Zealand appointee Sir Kenneth Keith.   Attorney-General David Lange, the former prime minister, willlead New Zealand's legal team.   The two French secret agents who sank the ship, Alain Mafart andDominique Prieur, pleaded guilty to arson and manslaughter inNovember 1985 and were sentenced to 10-year prison terms by a NewZealand court.   Perez de Cuellar later mediated a settlement under which Francepaid New Zealand $7 million in compensation, and New Zealand agreedto commute the prison terms if the two agents were detained on aFrench atoll until the end of 1989.   In 1987, however, Mafart returned to France, complaining of astomach ailment. In 1988, Ms. Prieur went home because she waspregnant. France flew both agents home and both received promotionson their return.   New Zealand protested and wants the two returned to custody.</TEXT></DOC>
