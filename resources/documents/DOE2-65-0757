These residua were separated into fractionsusing preparative size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). Room temperatureelectron spin resonance (ESR) experiments of SEC separated petroleum-derivedfractions are described. A variation of free radical concentration withdifferent molecular weight fractions was observed. Significant increasein free radical concentration was observed in the 1000-2500 amu range.This is in the molecular weight range postulated to be necessary forformation of the mesophase state observed in carbonaceous pitches duringconversion to coke and carbon by thermal treatment.</TEXT></DOC>
