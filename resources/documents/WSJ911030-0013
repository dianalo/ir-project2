As part of its restructuring, ATandamp;T formed a new wirelesscommunications services business to be part of the newlyformed Consumer Services unit, which will handle consumercommunications on a global scale. The other unit, BusinessServices, will serve corporate customers. ATandamp;T said itexpects to complete the changes in the next few months.</LP><TEXT>   ATandamp;T's move comes as its dominance of the long-distanceservices business continues to strengthen. Communicationsservices, which accounts for roughly $22 billion of thecompany's $44 billion in annual revenue, successfullystanched its loss of market share in the last year to rivalssuch as MCI Communications Corp., Washington, and US SprintCommunications Co., a unit of United Telecommunications,Westwood, Kan.   &quot;This has been a very successful business,&quot; said Victor A.Pelson, group executive in charge of ATandamp;T's servicesbusinesses. &quot;The time to change is when we're healthy androbust. . . . It's time to build for a robust future. . . .We want to be focused on global markets {such as} speechprocessing, {electronic} messaging and personalcommunications.&quot;   Still, ATandamp;T faces increased competition from domestic andinternational communications carriers, which are setting upglobal communications services to assist corporate customers.   In addition, ATandamp;T reassigned its internationalcommunications chief, John E. Berndt, to head BusinessServices. Robert J. Ranalli, former president of ConsumerCommunications Services, was named president of ConsumerServices.   Reporting to Mr. Berndt are Joseph P. Nacchio, formerlyvice president of Business Communications Services, who hasbeen made president of the business and two datacommunications units, ATandamp;T Istel, based in the UnitedKingdom, and ATandamp;T EasyLink Services, an electronic mail anddata messaging business.   Reporting to Mr. Ranalli are Merrill R. Tutton, formervice president of Consumer Communications Services who willbecome president of the unit and executives of ATandamp;T'sUniversal credit card business and American Transtech.   ATandamp;T's new Personal Communications Services will explorebusiness opportunities in what has become one of the hottestsegments in the telecommunications industry. Lewis M.Chakrin, vice president heads the unit and reports to Mr.Ranalli. Mr. Pelson, who declined to comment on the company'splans, called the new unit &quot;nominal&quot; in size next to ATandamp;T'scurrent long-distance business. This month, ATandamp;T receivedFederal Communications Commission approval to test a serviceusing its vast network of microwave towers with pocket-sizedradiophones. The company said it has begun the first phase ofthose tests.   Separately, ATandamp;T and Bell Atlantic Corp. agreed to test asystem that lets teachers, students and parents, either athome or in a classroom gain access through their phone linesto information in multimedia libraries and large-scalecomputer databases.   The trial test, which comes after a U.S. Appeals Courtrecently cleared the way for the regional Bell companies toenter the information services business, will be held in NewJersey during the 1992-93 and 1993-94 school years, BellAtlantic said.</TEXT></DOC>
