The species was described by Blomquist(1957) in his revision of the North American members of the genus <T3>Hexastylis</T3>. The plant's heart-shaped leaves are dark green incolor, evergreen and leathery, and are supported by long thin petiolesfrom a subsurface rhizome. Maximum height rarely exceeds 15 centimeters(6 inches). The jug-shaped flowers are usually beige to dark brown in colorand appear from mid-March to early June. The flowers are small and inconspicuousand are found near the base of the petioles. The fruit matures from mid-Mayto early July (Blomquist 1957, Gaddy 1980, 1981). <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> grows in acidic soils along bluffs and adjacentslopes, in boggy areas next to streams and creekheads, and along the slopesof nearby hillsides and ravines (Gaddy 1980, 1981). The species is distinguishedfrom other members of the genus <T3>Hexastylis</T3> by its small flowers and its distinctive habitat.<T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> is known only from an eight-county area inthe upper piedmont of North Carolina and adjacent South Carolina. Thereare 24 known populations of this species. The following summary of theknown distribution of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3>, by State and county, is extracted primarilyfrom Gaddy (1980, 1981). Additional information was supplied by Rayner(South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Department, personal communication,1986, 1987), Mansberg (North Carolina Department of Natural Resources andCommunity Development, personal communication, 1986, 1987), and Newberry(University of South Carolina at Spartanburg, personal communication, 1987).<ITAG tagnum="84">South Carolina</ITAG>Cherokee County supports only one population of approximately 150 plants.The plants are growing in an area which has been adversely impacted bysiltation from road construction.Greenville County supports eight populations of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora. </T3>The populations vary in size from 50 toseveral hundred individuals. Most of the populations are adjacent to therapidly expanding Greenville urban area or its suburbs and are threatenedby loss of habitat to residential, commercial, or industrial construction.Agricultural activities, such as conversion of woodlands to pasture orconstruction of small ponds, also threaten the species. Timber harvesting,except for small, selective cuts, would also adversely impact the species.Spartanburg County supports three populations of the species. One of thesecontains 2 individuals, one contains 75 individuals, and the last containsapproximately 1,400 individuals. The largest population in the county oncecontained over 4,000 plants; however, 64 percent of the population wasdestroyed by reservoir construction. Most of the remaining plants in thispopulation are being protected from further destruction by the City ofSpartanburg (commissioners of public works). The smallest population (twoplants) is within the right-of-way of the planned relocation of an interstatehighway. The population of 75 plants has been adversely impacted by soilerosion caused by grazing cattle.<ITAG tagnum="84">North Carolina</ITAG>Cleveland County contains three populations. One of these supports only10 plants and occurs on a poor quality site. The other 2 populations containabout 200 plants each. These two larger populations are threatened by timberharvesting, conversion of their habitat to pasture or small ponds, andcattle grazing.Catawba County supports one large, healthy population of over 1,000 plants.This site has been protected to a limited extent through the Natural AreasRegistry Program of the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program. This programalerts cooperative landowners to the significance of natural features ontheir property. It does not, however, provide long-term protection fromthe threats facing most populations of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora.</T3>Burke County contains 3 populations, varying in size from 10 to approximately500 individuals. The smallest population is on a poor quality site thatis littered with trash. The two larger populations remain vulnerable toloss or adverse modification of their habitat.Rutherford County currently contains three populations of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora. </T3>A fourth population was recently destroyedby road construction. The largest population, containing over 1,000 plants,is a registered natural area and thereby receives limited short-term protection.The smaller populations, 60 and 250 individuals respectively, are threatenedby the same activities previously mentioned.There are three records of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>from Lincoln County. One population has notbeen recently verified and may be lost, one has been destroyed, and thelast contains about 160 healthy plants. The site supporting these plantshas been selectively logged and remains vulnerable to destruction by clear-cuttingof timber and other previously referred to activities.Federal government actions on this species began with section 12 of theEndangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 <T3>et seq</T3>.), which directed the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institutionto prepare a report on those plants considered to be endangered, threatened,or extinct. This report, designated as House Document No. 94-51, was presentedto Congress on January 9, 1975. On July 1, 1975, the Service publisheda notice (40 FR 27823) which formally accepted the Smithsonian report asa petition within the context of section 4(c)(2) (now section 4(b)(3))of the Act. By accepting this report as a petition, the Service also acknowledgedits intention to review the status of those plant taxa named within thereport. <T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>was included in the Smithsonian report andthe July 1, 1975, notice of review. On June 16, 1976, the Service publisheda proposed rule (41 FR 24523) to determine approximately 1,700 vascularplant taxa to be endagered species pursuant to section 4 of the Act; <T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>was included in this proposal. The 1978 amendments to the Act required that all proposals over 2 yearsold be withdrawn. On December 10, 1979 (44 FR 70796), the Service publisheda notice withdrawing plants proposed on June 16, 1976. In 1979 the Servicealso funded a status survey for this species with the final status reportbeing completed in 1980. Based upon the information provided in the statusreport, <T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>was included as a category 1 species in theDecember 15, 1980, revised notice of review for native plants (45 FR 82480).<T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> was again included as a category 1 speciesin the September 27, 1985, publication of an updated notice of review fornative plants (50 FR 39526). Category 1 species are those for which theService currently has on file information to support the proposed additionof the species to the Federal list of endangered and threatened species.Publication of proposed rules for some of these species has been delayedbecause of the large number of species within this category. Section 4(b)(3)(B) of the Act, as amended in 1982, requires the Secretaryto make certain findings on pending petitions within 12 months of theirreceipt. Section 2(b)(1) of the 1982 amendments further requires that allpetitions pending on October 13, 1982, be treated as having been newlysubmitted on that date. This was the case for <T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>because of the acceptance of the 1975 Smithsonianreport as a petition. In 1983, 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987, the Servicefound that the petitioned listing of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>was warranted but precluded by other listingactions of a higher priority and that additional data on vulnerabilityand threats was still being gathered. On April 21, 1988, the Service published (53 FR 13223) a proposal to list<T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>as a threatened species. That proposal constitutedthe final finding as required by the 1982 amendments to the EndangeredSpecies Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations </ITAG>In the April 21, 1988, proposed rule and associated notifications, allinterested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate Stateagencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspapernotices inviting public comment were published in the <T3>Greenville News </T3>(Greenville County), <T3>Spartanburg Herald </T3>(Spartanburg County), <T3>Gaffney Ledger </T3>(Cherokee County), <T3>Shelby Star </T3>(Cleveland County), <T3>Hickory Daily Record </T3>(Catawba County), <T3>Lincoln Times </T3>(Lincoln County), <T3>News Herald </T3>(Burke County), and <T3>Daily Courier </T3>(Rutherford County). One comment was received inresponse to the proposed rule. The Catawba County manager's office statedthat it knew of no conflicts between county projects and protection ofthe Catawba County site. They outlined several protective measures thatmay be applicable to the population and stated that the county did notobject to designation of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>as a threatened species. The States of NorthCarolina and South Carolina had previously expressed their support forthe addition of the species to the Federal list. The Service concurs with the conclusion that <T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>merits protection under the Act. The Servicehas evaluated the available information on the status of, and threats to,this species and believes that threatened status is appropriate. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Factors Affecting the Species </ITAG>After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that <T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>should be classified as a threatened species.Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Act and regulations (50 CFRPart 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of the Act werefollowed. A species may be determined to be endangered or threatened dueto one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1). Thesefactors and their application to <T3>Hexastylis naniflora </T3>Blomquist (dwarf-flowered heartleaf) areas follows: A. <T3>The present or threatened destruction, modification, or curtailmentof its habitat or range.</T3> Gaddy (1981) found that much of the habitatthat <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> prefers has been destroyed by peach orchards,pastures, housing developments, and ponds. During searches for additionalpopulations of the species, Gaddy (1981) discovered that many small pondshad been constructed at what were formerly springy creekheads. Many ofthese areas may have supported the species prior to being impounded.  A large number of the known <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> populations occur near expanding urban areasand are threatened by the residential, commercial, and industrial developmentassociated with this growth. Populations occurring in more rural areasare threatened by habitat alteration or loss from land conversion to pastureor other agricultural uses, cattle grazing, intensive timber harvesting,residential construction, and construction of small ponds. Only four populationscurrently receive some form of protection. The City of Spartanburg, SouthCarolina, through a policy statement issued by the commissioners of publicworks, has agreed to protect most of the largest South Carolina population.Two of the larger North Carolina populations are registered natural areasunder the North Carolina Natural Heritage Program, and one South Carolinapopulation is registered by The Nature Conservancy. These populations therebyreceive short-term protection from loss or alteration. Registry agreementsare, however, nonbinding; and these three populations remain vulnerableto destruction in the long-term.  B. <T3>Overutilization for commercial, recreational, scientific, or educationalpurposes.</T3> <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> is not currently a significant componentof the commercial trade in native plants; however, the species has potentialfor horticultural use, and publicity surrounding the listing of the speciescould generate an increased demand.  C. <T3>Disease or predation.</T3> Not applicable to this species at this time. D. <T3>The inadequacy of existing regulatory mechanisms. </T3><T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> is listed as an endangered species in NorthCarolina and is afforded legal protection in that State. North CarolinaGeneral Statute 19-B, 202.12-202.19, provides State-listed plants protectionfrom intrastate trade without a permit and provides for monitoring andmanagement of populations of listed species. Although unofficially recognizedas an endangered component of South Carolina's flora by the South CarolinaWildlife and Marine Resources Department, <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> has no official protection status in theState. Section 404 of the Clean Water Act could potentially provide someprotection for the dwarf-flowered heartleaf's habitat; however, most ofthe sites where it occurs do not meet the wetlands criteria of the CleanWater Act. The Endangered Species Act will provide additional protectionfor <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3>.  E. <T3>Other natural or manmade factors affecting its continued existence.</T3>Several of the known populations of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> occur on steep ravine slopes which also supportstands of mixed hardwoods with an understory of mountain laurel (<T3>Kalmia latiflora</T3>) or <T3>Rhododendron spp.</T3> These stands are often very dense and reducethe amount of light reaching the <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> plants growing below. Under these conditionsthe plants often show reduced vigor and reduced flower and fruit production.Careful, selective logging or natural tree fall and limited understoryremoval would open up these populations to more light. Additional light,if not accompanied by increased siltation from the intensive soil disturbancesassociated with forest clear-cutting, probably would benefit these populations(Gaddy 1981).  The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thisspecies in determining to make this rule final. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> as a threatened species. Threatened statusseems appropriate because of the number of populations that currently existand the protection provided to several of the larger populations. Criticalhabitat is not being designated for the reasons discussed below.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat  </ITAG>Section 4(a)(3) of the Act, as amended, requires that, to the maximum extentprudent and determinable, the Secretary designate any habitat of a specieswhich is considered to be critical habitat at the time the species is determinedto be endangered or threatened. Most populations of this species are small,and loss of even a few individuals to activities such as collection forscientific purposes could extirpate the species from some locations. Takingof listed plants is only regulated by the Act in case of removal, reductionto possession, and malicious damage or destruction from lands under Federaljurisdiction; and removal, cutting, digging up, or destroying in knowingviolation of any state law or regulation, including state criminal tresspasslaw. Publication of critical habitat descriptions and maps would increasethe vulnerability of the species without significantly increasing protection.The owners and managers of all the known populations of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> will be made aware of the plant's locationand of the importance of protecting the plant and its habitat. Protectionof this species' habitat will be addressed through the recovery processand through the Section 7 jeopardy standard. No additional benefits wouldresult from a determination of critical habitat. Therefore, the Serviceconcludes that it is not prudent to designate critical habitat for <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3>.Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State, and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. Such actions are initiated by the Service following listing. Theprotection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitions against takingare discussed, in part, below.Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of such a speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay adversely affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsibleFederal agency must enter into consultation with the Service. All of theknown populations of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> are on privately or municipally owned land.The only known Federal activity that may affect this species is the relocationof an interstate highway in South Carolina. A small population consistingof two clumps of plants may be lost during construction of this project.It is not expected that this loss, if it should occur, will significantlyaffect the survival and recovery of <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3>.The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.71 and 17.72set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptions that applyto all threatened plants. All trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) ofthe Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.71, apply. These prohibitions, in part,make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the UnitedStates to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commercein the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale this speciesin interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce it to possessionfrom areas under Federal jurisdiction. Seeds from cultivated specimensof threatened plant species are exempt from these prohibitions providedthat a statement of ``cultivated origin'' appears on their containers.In addition, for listed plants the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) tothe Act prohibit their malicious damage or destruction on Federal lands,and their removal, cutting, digging up, or damaging or destroying in knowingviolation of any state law or regulation, including state criminal trespasslaw. Certain exceptions can apply to agents of the Service and State conservationagencies. The Act and 50 CFR 17.72 also provide for the issuance of permitsto carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving threatened speciesunder certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits willever be sought or issued, since <T3>Hexastylis naniflora</T3> is not common in cultivation or in the wild.Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiries regardingthem may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority, U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 27329, Central Station, Washington, DC 20038-7329(202/343-4955).<ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act</ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, neednot be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuant to section4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
