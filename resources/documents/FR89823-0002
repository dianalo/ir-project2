The FAA has received several reports of fatal accidents which haveoccurred after the seat back failed, causing the jamming of the rear controlstick and loss of control of the airplane.

The preliminary investigationby the Canadian Aviation Safety Board (CASB) indicated that the crash wasdue to a failure of the folding backrest frame of the pilot's seat at thepivot point of the backrest which caused the pilot to shift aft contactingthe rear flight control. This caused the airplane to pitch nose-up withoutrecovery. Two other airplanes of this type were inspected by the CASB and similarsigns of metal fractures were evident on one of these seats. On February18, 1987, Transport Canada issued Service Difficulty Alert (SDA) No. 87-01,relating to these failures. An alert similar to Canadian SDA No. 87-01was issued by the FAA in the February 1987 issue of Advisory Circular (AC)No. 43-16, ``General Aviation Airworthiness Alerts''. On November 14, 1988, the FAA was notified by the National TransportationSafety Board (NTSB) of a fatal accident involving a Bellanca Model 8KCABairplane. The investigation by the NTSB disclosed that the pilot's foldingseatback had failed at the hinge point on the right side and at the weldedjunction of the seat's lower side tube and seatback side brace on the leftside. It is believed that the pilot fell backward and inadvertently exceededthe airplane's design stress limits by pulling or jerking on the frontcontrol stick or by hitting or jamming the rear control stick. A reviewof Service Difficulty Reports (SDR) regarding failures of the folding seatbackframes in both Bellanca 7 and 8 series airplanes revealed reports of similarfailures. Since February 1989, the FAA has been working with FRA Enterprisesand American Champion Aircraft to increase the structural integrity ofthe folding seat frame and to develop a means for restraining aft seatmovement. As a result, American Champion Aircraft has issued Service LetterNo. 401, dated June 14, 1989, as a means to correct the front folding seatproblem. Since the FAA has determined that the unsafe condition describedherein is likely to exist or develop in other airplanes of the same typedesign, an AD is being issued requiring inspections for cracks in the seatframe and replacement of the seat frame on American Champion Aircraft (Bellanca,Champion) Models 7ECA, 7GCAA, 7GCBC, 7KCAB, 8GCBC, and 8KCAB airplanesequipped with front folding seats. Because an emergency condition existsthat requires the immediate adoption of this regulation, it is found thatnotice and public procedure hereon are impractical and contrary to thepublic interest, and good cause exists for making this amendment effectivein less than 30 days. The regulations adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not major under section 8 of Executive Order 12291. It isimpracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of Order 12291 withrespect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediately to correctan unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determined that thisdocument involves an emergency regulation under DOT Regulatory Policiesand Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this action is subsequentlydetermined to involve a significant regulation, a final regulatory evaluationor analysis, as appropriate, will be prepared and placed in the regulatorydocket (otherwise, an evaluation is not required). A copy of it, when filed,may be obtained by contacting the Rules Docket under the caption <T2>``ADDRESSES''</T2> at the location identified. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends Section 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe FAR as follows:1.
