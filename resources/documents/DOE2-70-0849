<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-70-0849 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Raman spectra of powders of the beta-HMX (cyclotetramethylene- tetranitramine)polymorph containing 2 to 14% of the alpha- or gamma-HMX polymorphs havebeen measured. The Raman spectra of each polymorph contains over 40 peaks,but a beta phase peak at 361 cm{sup {minus}1}, an alpha phase peak at1217 cm{sup {minus}1}, and a gamma phase peak at 1225 cm{sup {minus}1}are sufficiently isolated from other peaks to be used for concentrationmeasurements. The relatively strong intensities of the peaks indicatethat concentrations on the order of 0.1% of alpha or gamma phases inthe beta phase should be detectable. Applications of this technique havebeen qualification of a production batch of HMX and testing for polymorphconversion in aged pellets. 11 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
