<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-27-0377 </DOCNO><TEXT>The gross beta radioactivity in the air was measured and the radioactivityof the individual radionuclides in samples was determined by gamma spectroscopy.The maximum increase in radioactivity was found for the afternoon ofApril 29, 1986; the maximum value of 200 Bq/m/sup 3/ was recorded forApril 30, 1986. The main part of the radioactivity was due to short-livedfission products /sup 132/Te and /sup 132/I. Other fission products werealso observed (/sup 131/I, /sup 137/Cs, /sup 140/Ba, etc.). A transientincrease in the atmospheric radioactivity was recorded in two more cases;the final drop occurred on the 13th day after the accident. A growthwas observed in the levels of nonvolatile radionuclides (/sup 103/Ru,/sup 140/Ba) as against volatile radionuclides (/sup 134/Cs, /sup 137/Cs).The calculated dose load due to the inhalation of radioactive materialsis lower by one order than that due to the inhalation of natural radionuclides.(E.S.). 2 figs., 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
