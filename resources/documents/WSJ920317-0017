Russia's decision to set up the ministry, announced at anews conference by Deputy Prime Minister Sergei Shakhrai, islikely to further weaken the fragile Commonwealth ofIndependent States, the 11-nation union of former Sovietrepublics.</LP><TEXT>   Russia still supports a joint military force under theCommonwealth's command, Mr. Shakhrai said. But by creatingits own defense ministry, Russia seems to be positioningitself to provide for its own security needs if and when theCommonwealth finally collapses. The decree &quot;doesn't mean thatRussian armed forces have been formed,&quot; Mr. Shakhrai said.&quot;Although, virtually, they already exist.&quot;   At least five other republics -- Ukraine, Azerbaijan,Uzbekistan, Belarus and Moldova -- have declared theirintention to maintain their own armed forces. If Russia,which dominates the three-month-old Commonwealth, decides togo it alone militarily, the faltering union is all butfinished as a collective security instrument. By forming itsown military, Russia would leave little of militarysignificance to the rest of the Commonwealth. And yesterday'smove appears to make a political statement as to Russia's owndwindling faith in the Commonwealth military structure.   &quot;There seems to be a recognition that there isn't muchlogic behind the continuation of a C.I.S. military,&quot; said aWestern defense attache, who requested anonymity. &quot;Themilitary itself is confused now as to whom it takes itsorders from.&quot;   Senior officers of the former Soviet military are likelyto oppose Russia's decision to form its own army, the Westernattache said. Generally, these officers have argued that theU.S.S.R. military structure must be preserved under theCommonwealth. But there isn't any sign that the militaryplans to take any action to protest the breakup of the formerSoviet force.   Mr. Yeltsin made no comment on the decree. The RussianITAR-Tass news service reported that Mr. Yeltsin returned tothe capital Monday from a brief &quot;working holiday&quot; in theGeorgian resort city of Sochi.   Russia's announcement comes on the eve of a criticalmeeting of Commonwealth leaders scheduled for Friday in Kiev,the Ukrainian capital. In preliminary talks, Commonwealthofficials have made progress on potentially divisive issues,including how to share responsibility for the former SovietUnion's foreign debt. But solutions to disputes over militarymatters have proved elusive.   Ukraine stunned Russia and international observersThursday when President Leonid Kravchuk announced thatUkraine would cease, at least temporarily, transferringnuclear weapons to Russia for dismantling. Mr. Kravchukcontended that Russia hasn't been able to guarantee that theweapons are being disposed of safely.   Prior to Mr. Kravchuk's announcement, the 11 Commonwealthmembers had been able to agree that, while republics couldform conventional armies, they would keep all nuclear weaponsunder a single command in Moscow. Russia and Ukraineofficials now are seeking a solution to the latest impasse.   Ukraine and Russia also have failed to resolve along-running dispute over who controls the Black Sea Fleet,which is based in the Crimea, a Russian-populated enclave inUkraine. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, who heads theCommonwealth's joint armed forces, said the fleet &quot;is part ofC.I.S. strategic forces and doesn't belong to any particularstate.&quot; Kiev has declared that the fleet, or at least a bigchunk of it, belongs to Ukraine.   That issue, too, is likely to be debated at the Kievmeeting, a gathering that some observers in Moscow conjecturecould be the Commonwealth's last.</TEXT></DOC>
