Take Alvin Hess, a retired kitchen-equipment executive in Hollywood, Fla. Shortly after Oct. 19 he moved his mutual-fund assets into money-market funds. But in recent weeks he has yanked more than half of that money-market stash, and has plunked it into long-term bond funds.    &quot;I'm still running scared,&quot; he says. &quot;But I thought I'd take a more positive stance.&quot;    Mr. Hess isn't alone. The Investment Company Institute, a Washington-based trade group, says assets of the nation's 429 money-market funds fell $2.4 billion, to $264.8 billion, in the week ended Wednesday.    Money-fund assets now have fallen about $10 billion in the past month, with about half of that amount reflecting withdrawals by individual investors, says Jacob Dreyer, the institute's chief economist. &quot;That's not a trivial amount by any standard,&quot; Mr. Dreyer says, adding: &quot;It is clear that a lot of this money is going directly into long-term bond and equity funds.&quot;    The Donoghue Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter, reports a big decrease in assets, too. Assets of taxable money funds fell $1.4 billion in the week ended Tuesday, to $252.6 billion, with more than $1 billion of that drop coming from individual investors, Donoghue says.    Some investors seem to be &quot;gaining confidence&quot; in the capital markets again, says Cyndi Andrade, Donoghue editorial manager.    Not all fund groups have seen the switch yet, however. At Dreyfus Corp., New York, &quot;It could and should happen, but we're not seeing it,&quot; says Howard Stein, chairman. And fund specialists caution that if the stock and bond markets turn around and head lower again, money quickly will flow back into money funds.    Still, several major fund groups have seen a change this month. At Valley Forge, Pa.-based Vanguard Group Inc., money has flowed out of money funds this month for the first time since late last year. Vanguard officials say much of the money is being switched into conservative equity funds, as well as some long-term bond funds.    &quot;It had been building up for a long time,&quot; says Brian Mattes, a Vanguard vice president. &quot;We've been waiting for it to open up.&quot;    The same pattern has emerged at Boston-based Fidelity Investments and at Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price Associates Inc., officials said. &quot;Investors are going back, selectively and carefully, into equities and some long-term bond funds,&quot; says Michael Hines, a Fidelity vice president. Some beneficiaries: Fidelity's Magellan Fund, Capital Appreciation Fund and Select OTC Fund, Mr. Hines says.    For the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute said assets of 214 general purpose funds fell $1.6 billion to $81.3 billion, while the assets of 97 broker-dealer funds fell $372 million to $113.3 billion. Assets of 118 institutional funds fell $450 million, to $70.2 billion.    The average seven-day yield for funds, in the week ended Tuesday, rose to 6.50% from 6.42% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report. The average 30-day yield for funds rose to 6.39% from 6.33%, and the average maturity of funds remained at 37 days.    Banks were paying an average yield of 5.56% on money-market savings accounts in the week ended Wednesday, unchanged from the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. Bank yields were 6.80% on six-month savings certificates of deposit, compared with 6.82% the previous week, and 7.25% for one-year bank savings CDs, compared with 7.23%. </TEXT></DOC>
