EPA restrictions include a requirement that the herbicide, alachlor -- marketed by Monsanto under the trade name Lasso -- be sold only to and used only by applicators certified by their respective state governments. The EPA requires that for large users of the herbicide, the product remain enclosed during mixing to reduce exposure to workers. Alachlor has been found to cause tumors in laboratory animals.    Monsanto says about 90% of alachlor users are currently certified.    &quot;We can live with&quot; the restrictions, a spokesman said. The company said the EPA's conclusion of its three-year review of the herbicide should have &quot;minimal&quot; effects on its sales, which are more than $200 million annually.    In May, Massachussetts banned alachlor as did Canada last year. Both governments are reviewing their decisions, Monsanto said.    The EPA has also required that Monsanto monitor the extent of the herbicide's leakage into groundwater. Studies have shown that the herbicide has been found in drinking wells. An EPA spokesman said the monitoring would provide &quot;the kind of data we would use to take any further regulatory action.&quot;    In the OSHA case, Monsanto was cited for 18 willful violations at its Nitro, W.Va., plant and its former Deep River, Conn., plant. The settlement reduced the total fine to $29,000 from $60,000 and said the alleged record-keeping violations &quot;were not intentional.&quot;    The company has also agreed to bring its corporatewide record-keeping practices into accord with federal regulations, an OSHA spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
