By ignoring it, wesilently condone it,'' said Rep. Barbara B. Kennelly, D-Conn. ``Bydocumenting its existence, incident by incident, we are forced toface its reality, whereby we begin to find a solution.''   Such hate crimes are now reported to the federal government onlyas assaults, arson, vandalism, threats or homicides without detailsof their roots in discrimination.   The House passed the Hate Crime Statistics Act last year, but themeasure died in the Senate.   Congressional aides said the measure failed last year becauseSen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., wanted to strip out mention of ``sexualpreference'' in the final days of the session. Sen. Paul Simon,D-Ill., the bill's Senate author, refused and time ran out.   But this year, advocates are confident the bill will be enacted.An aide to Helms said she did not know what position theconservative senator would take on the legislation, but supporterssaid they were pushing the measure early to give themselves enoughtime to circumvent any Helms opposition.   Proponents again vowed not to remove the sexual preferencelanguage from the bill. Maine Attorney General James Tierney warnedthat such a move could send a signal of condoning crimes againsthomosexuals   Simon planned to bring the measure up for a vote in the SenateJudiciary Committee as early as next week, and Mrs. Kennellypredicted easy passage in the House.   Baltimore County Police Col. Leonard J. Supenski said the measurewould have a tangible effect on police trying to cope with hatecrimes by pointing out problem areas and trends.   ``We simply must have reliable information,'' said Supenski.``Who is involved? What happened? What does it look like? Where isit happening? How often? To how many victims? By whom? Answers tothese questions are important in assessing the needs of the victimand the community in order to determine appropriate policeresponse.''   ``You can't deal with the problem if you don't know the realityof the facts,'' added Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.</TEXT></DOC>
