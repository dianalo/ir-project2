(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A wave struck a freight elevator on anaircraft carrier as sailors moved missiles from one deck to anotherearly Tuesday, sweeping three men and 38 missiles into the AtlanticOcean, the Navy said. Two sailors were rescued.   In the Pacific Ocean, another sailor was missing after beingswept off a Navy carrier into rough seas Monday night, a Navyspokesman said Tuesday.   Navy planes and ships searched through the day for the twosailors from the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower in the Atlantic and theUSS Carl Vinson in the Pacific. The accidents aboard the Vinson 620miles north of Wake Island and on the Eisenhower 90 miles southeastof Cape Hatteras, N.C., were the third and fourth accidents on Navyships in three days.   The accident aboard the Eisenhower occurred at 1:15 a.m. duringroutine operations, the Navy said in a news release.   The two sailors were rescued about an hour later. One was inserious condition and the other was in good condition, said Lt.j.g. Karl Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman. They were beingtreated aboard ship, he said.   One was pulled from the ocean by helicopter and the other byboat, Johnson said. Their names were withheld pending notificationof relatives.   The search for the missing man, identified as Airman Craig A.Harris, 22, of Uniontown, Pa., was called off late in theafternoon, said Lt. Paul Jenkins, another Atlantic Fleet spokesman.   Eighteen Sparrow and 20 Sidewinder missiles went down in thedeep water, but the non-nuclear, air-to-air missiles posed no risk,the Navy said.   ``They were not nuclear-powered. They were not armed,'' saidanother spokesman, Senior Chief Petty Officer Cindy Adams.``Therefore, they're harmless.''   The sailors were knocked overboard by a wave while they movedthe missiles and other ordnance and gear from the flight deck downto the hangar deck.   The sailors were on an elevator even with the hangar deck, about20 to 30 feet above the water line, when the wave hit, saidJohnson. The ship reported that it was raining and waves wererunning 4 to 8 feet at the time, he said.   Johnson said he did not know the value of the missiles.   Joining in the search for the missing sailor was the destroyerUSS Dewey and the guided missile frigate USS Carr, as well asaircraft from the carrier, Johnson said.   In the Pacific, the Vinson, the guided missile cruisers USSCalifornia and USS Vincennes, several aircraft and helicopterssearched for the Vinson crewman who was swept overboard theprevious night, Chief Petty Officer Erik Erickson said in NavalBase San Francisco.   The sailor, who was not identified, fell into the sea at 10:26p.m. PST Monday as the aircraft carrier encountered 12-foot swells,Erickson said. The ship was returning to its home port at theAlameda Naval Air Station on San Francisco Bay after participatingin exercises.   On Sunday, a pilot making his first landing on an aircraftcarrier crashed on the USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, killinghim and four people on the ship. The Navy refused Thursday torelease a videotape showing the jet crash.   The tape will not be made public because it is part of theaccident investigation, said Fred Hoffman, a Defense Departmentspokesman in Washington.   On Monday, a pilot accidentally dropped a bomb on the guidedmissile cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean, injuring fivesailors.   By far the worst Navy accident this year was the explosion in aturret of the battleship USS Iowa in April. The blast killed 47sailors.   Hoffman said he saw no connection between the recent Navyaccidents. Hoffman said the Navy has an excellent safety record.   Johnson said he had no figures on how common it is for a sailorto be washed overboard and lost.   According to news reports, there have been at least fourincidents this year in which sailors have fallen or been swept fromvessels.</TEXT></DOC>
