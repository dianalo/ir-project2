Close enough to wonderhow much farther he still had to go.;    In 1984 and 1990, Ian Baker-Finchteed off as part of the final group on the final day of the British Open, andboth times the man who played alongside him finished the tournament byhoisting the silver claret jug above his head.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  NO LOOKING BACKBAKER-FINCH'S FRONT-NINE 29 SETS UP VICTORY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  British OpenChart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO><TEXT>     Sunday, it was Baker-Finch's turn. He seized control at the outset of thefinal round and never let go, coasting home to a two-shot victory over fellowAustralian Mike Harwood in the British Open at Royal Birkdale.;    Baker-Finchbirdied five of the first seven holes. He opened a five-stroke lead over thefield before closing with a final-round 66 and an 8-under-par total of 272.;   &quot;I must admit that it was difficult visualizing winning, because I had lostso many times,&quot; said Baker-Finch, who has finished second or third eight timeson the PGA Tour since last year. &quot;But I've been thinking maybe I've finallypaid all my dues. I just came here kind of feeling, 'Hey, this is the one,boy.' &quot;;    His 29 on the front nine has been equaled on the final day of amajor championship by only one other player, Fred Couples at the 1982 PGAChampionship. His 64 and 66 in the last two rounds tied the record for thelowest final 36 holes shot in a major championship, a mark set by Tom Watsonin the 1977 British Open at Turnberry.;    Harwood closed with a 67 but nevergot closer than two shots after Baker-Finch birdied the second hole.;   Similarly foiled were the two U.S. players who tied for third at 275: Couples,who had a closing 64, and Mark O'Meara, who shot a 69 after sharing thethird-round lead with Baker-Finch.;    &quot;Sometimes you get off to a start likeIan did, and it's hard to keep it going,&quot; said O'Meara, who lives nearBaker-Finch in Orlando, Fla., and is one of his close friends. &quot;But he playeda phenomenal round of golf. It seemed like he never missed a shot.&quot;;   Baker-Finch made a 12-foot putt for his first birdie on the second hole, a10-footer for another on the third, a six-footer on the fourth, anothersix-footer on the sixth, and a 15-footer to complete the string on theseventh.;    &quot;I think the best visualizer in the world couldn't havevisualized that start,&quot; said Baker-Finch, who three months ago began workingwith sports psychologist Bob Rotella. &quot;I had to keep pinching myself.&quot;;    Hefaltered briefly on the 10th hole, where his drive landed in a fairway bunkerand cost him a bogey. But he never came close to dropping another shot untilthe 18th, when it didn't matter anymore.;    Baker-Finch's previous runs atthe title ended in disappointment.;    In 1984, while playing with eventualchampion Tom Watson, he shot a final-round 79. He was tied for second goinginto the last round a year ago, but he plummeted down the leader board with a73 while watching Nick Faldo win the title.;    As he stood outside theclubhouse at Royal Birkdale late Sunday afternoon, kissing his trophy, heseemed a man with a much-improved self-image.;    &quot;Today erases all of thosememories,&quot; he said. &quot;I'd give everything I've ever won before for this jug.I've got my hands on it now, and I really don't care what happens (the rest ofthe year). . . . The British Open, to me, is the world championship.&quot;;  British Open; results; Ian Baker-Finch   71-71-64-66--272; Mike Harwood     68-70-69-67--274; M.
