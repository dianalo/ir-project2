For a squaregrid containing n points, they are able to update a value or retrievethe sum of the values in a region in O(log n) time, with only O(n/sup1/3/) processors. For points uniformly distributed in a square, a similarresult holds for the expected time. Furthermore, the structure is suchthat the number of processor is between 0 and n/sup 1/3/, the speedupdue to adding processors is linear.</TEXT></DOC>
