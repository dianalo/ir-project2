Security Councilmembers help prepare for Arab-Israeli peace talks _ a proposal maderecently by Soviet officials.   ``We think that there may be preparatory work that can be doneamong the five permanent members of the Security Council,'' saidWilliam Waldegrave, Britain's minister of state for foreign affairs.   Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze last month suggestedthat the five permanent members should meet to discuss how toarrange a U.N.-sponsored peace conference that has been endorsed bythe Arab states, the European Economic Community and other nations.   Waldegrave arrived in Jordan Monday after six days in Israel andthe West Bank and Gaza Strip, occupied by Israel after the 1967Middle East war.   In his speech to the Jordan-British Society, Waldegrave did notrefer explicitly to the Soviet proposal. He repeatedly criticizedthe hard-line stands taken by Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir.   The Arabs favor a conference attended by the five permanentmembers as well as all the parties to the conflict.   U.S. officials have warily endorsed the idea of an internationalconference, but only if it leads to direct talks between Israel andits Arab foes. Shamir rejects such a conference.   Waldegrave stressed that the EEC is now an economic superpowergreater than the United States and has deep interests in the region.   He indicated Europeans should be represented in peace efforts,saying the ``best way forward'' was through a conference involvingpowers with legitimate interests in the region _ a reference both tothe Security Council members and European states.   Waldegrave said Shamir's description of the occupied territoriesas ``liberated'' was ``simply bizarre, to use a Britishunderstatement.''   ``My visit to Nablus (on the West Bank) under curfew brought hometo me forcibly that the territories are indeed under complete andthorough military occupation.''   He quoted British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher as saying thatthe occupation ``can only be temporary,'' and cited the Palestinianuprising in which more than 380 Palestinians and at least 17Israelis have died.   ``If the way to peace is not found soon, a worse conflagrationwill ignite,'' Waldegrave said.   ``The Palestinians have made their painful concession,'' he said.``That is why the world community is saying to Israel, must say toIsrael, the time has now come for you to respond.''   In Vienna, U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III told threehigh-ranking West European officials on Monday that now is not theright time for Washington to launch a new initiative in the MiddleEast or for a peace conference on the Arab-Israeli conflict.   Baker met with foreign ministers Roland Dumas of France,Francisco Fernandez-Ordonez of Spain and Karolos Papoulias of Greece.   The three-man group, representing the 12-nation European EconomicCommunity, has spearheaded a drive for Middle East peacenegotiations on the theory the Palestinians have taken a moremoderate stance toward Israel.   But Baker told them ``there is a need to proceed carefully'' andthat the time is not right to push for a conference, according to aU.S. official who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity.</TEXT></DOC>
