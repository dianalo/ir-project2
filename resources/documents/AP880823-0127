Officials in both countries expected the death toll to rise asrelief workers reached remote towns that have been inaccessiblesince Sunday's devastating quake.   Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that continued Tuesday,while others had 3-foot-deep cracks or were blocked by boulders thesize of houses in the Himalayan mountains and valleys.   At least 531 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek BahadurThapa, additional secretary in the Home Affairs Ministry.   Prime Minister Marich Man Singh Shrestha visited Dharan, one ofthe hardest-hit towns, and surveyed heaps of bricks that were oncethree-story and five-story houses.   ``This is the biggest calamity to strike Nepal,'' Shrestha saidas he toured the town.   India reported an official death toll of 200, but the figure wasdisputed by news media and opposition politicians who put theIndian death count at anywhere from 400 to 1,500.   In Darbhanga, India on Tuesday, worshipers offered sweets, milkand coconuts to appease the Hindu god of destruction. Women dressedin colorful saris gathered at countryside temples in thequake-ravaged areas of eastern Bihar state to pray and presenttheir offerings to Lord Shiva, the god of destruction in the Hindutrinity.   ``If God is pleased, nothing will happen,'' said one woman, whorefused to give her name.   The earthquake, which struck shortly before daybreak Sunday whenmost people were still asleep, registered 6.5 on the Richter scale.It was the deadliest quake in the region since 1950 when a temblorin the east Indian state of Assam killed 1,500 by official countand 30,000 by seismologists' accounts.   Dharan, 105 miles southeast of Katmandu, sits on a rolling plainat the base of a steep hill. At least 131 bodies have been found inthe town of 100,000.   Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made ofbricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonalmonsoon rains.   Police Inspector G. Adhikari said bulldozers have demolishedmore than 50 houses deemed too dangerous for habitation. ``We willcontinue to demolish houses until we are satisfied (the onesremaining) are safe to live in,'' he said.   British soldiers from a nearby Gurkha recruiting center pitchedin with cranes to aid the demolition. Dharan is in the heart ofregional famed for fierce Gurkha fighters who have served in theBritish army for more than 150 years.   Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from thegovernment on compensation or new housing for people whose homeswere demolished. Most of the homeless have moved in with neighborsof found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth.   The hardest hit areas in India were in Bihar state just acrossthe Nepalese border.   Rescuers in army helicopters searched for survivors in Bihar'sDarbhanga, Madhubani and Mungar districts. Other helicoptersferried medicine, rice, cooking oil, clothes and tents to policetrapped in the most remote regions of Bihar, India's poorest state.   Heavy rains, overflowing rivers and submerged bridges and roadshampered attempts by 1,000 Indian soldiers to provide assistance.   In Nepal, 88-pound bags of rice were being distributed tofamilies affected by the quake, but officials were unable to giveany figures.   International agencies operating in Nepal were gearing up tocontribute supplies or assistance but have not yet heard from thegovernment on what was wanted, according to several foreign reliefworkers who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Shrestha said the mountain kingdom had not sought foreign aidbecause ``we are still assessing the magnitude of the tragedy.''Some supplies, medicine and health workers arrived in eastern Nepalon Tuesday. Donors included UNICEF and the government of Japan andBritain.   Nepal is one of the world's poorest countries. Two-third of thechildren under age of 5 suffer from malnutrition and lifeexpectancy is 52, according to UNICEF. A nation of 17 million,Nepal has one doctor for every 22,650 people, compared with 5,000people per doctor in India and 780 per doctor in the United States.   Aftershocks have persisted since Sunday's earthquake, and rumorsof an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into thestreets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan. Therumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by word ofmouth. In Dharan, men ran from houses to houses rousing people fromtheir sleep.</TEXT></DOC>
