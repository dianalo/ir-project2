Authorities detained at least 200 people nationwide, accordingto Zbigniew Romaszewski, a spokesman for the outlawed Solidarityunion. The violent protests came at the end of a a week of strikesand the worst labor unrest in Poland since the communist governmentsuspended Solidarity in December 1981 and later declared it illegal.   There were scattered reports of injuries but figures were notavailable.   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban confirmed 90 detentions andsaid at least 12,000 people took part in illegal demonstrationsnationwide. Reports from witnesses and opposition spokesmen put thenumber at more than 30,000.   The state-run news agency PAP said more than 9 million peopleattended official May Day ceremonies throughout the country and``attempts to boycott the May Day demonstrations ended up yet againwith a complete fiasco.''   Polish leader Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski took a tough line on wagedemands during ceremonies in Warsaw.   A strike was in its sixth day at the Lenin steel mill in NowaHuta outside Krakow. About 800 strikers gathered for a Mass arounda makeshift altar with a homemade cross in the pressing department.   Thirty to 50 people outside the gates were detained when theytried to stage a sympathy march to the plant, which was ringed withplatoons of riot police.   Earlier, about 3,000 people marched a half-mile from a RomanCatholic church in Nowa Huta toward the steel mill but followedpolice orders to disperse.   Organizers said about 16,000 workers are on strike at the plant,demanding recognition of their union rights and an immediate 50percent raise on the average salary of $105 a month.   Police withdrew from around the mill in the afternoon. About 120strikers and 50 family members and friends then had an emotionalmeeting at the plant gates.   Strike leader Andrzej Szewczuwaniec, brushing back tears, vowedthe strike will continue. ``We will not disappoint our wives, oursons, our mothers,'' he said.   In the evening in Nowa Huta, 5,000 people rallied at a churchand taunted police, saying: ``So long until the third.''Anti-government demonstrations occur every May 3, Poland's pre-warConstitution Day.   The Lenin mill strike committee on Sunday wrote Deputy PrimeMinister Zdzislaw Sadowski, in charge of the economy and planning,asking him to negotiate directly because management was unable toreach an agreement, said Grzegorz Surdy, a spokesman for thestrikers.   Solidarity founder Lech Walesa, speaking outside St. Brygida'sCatholic Church in Gdansk, told about 6,000 supporters that thetime had come for them to take a stand in support of the strikingsteel workers.   ``I demand from you solidarity with Nowa Huta tomorrow, in yourshipyards, in your ports and in your factories. I want it to beeffective. Show me tomorrow what you can do,'' he declared.   He said he was not necessarily calling for strikes. ``It's up toyou to do what you can. ... If you have an army, General Walesa isat your disposal.''   Following the Mass and rally in Gdansk, about 500 youngmilitants tried to march through the city. They were attacked fromtwo directions by police swinging clubs.   During a 40-minute melee, protesters hurled rocks and policebeat demonstrators.   When two police officers ran inside the church to catchstone-throwers, they were disarmed and beaten by youths.   Outside, police kicked and beat demonstators and at least fourpeople were seen bleeding. Dozens were herded into police vans.   Solidarity, was the only independent labor union movement in theSoviet bloc when it was created in Gdansk in 1980 during nationwidestrikes. It was suppressed, then outlawed, after martial law wasdeclared in December 1981.   The union movement last month called for a ``day of protest''against price hikes and the lack of union freedoms.   The demonstrations came after a week in which Poland was hit bythree strikes: one by transit drivers in Bydgoszcz that was settledMonday; another by heavy machinery factory workers in Stalowa Wola,resolved Saturday, and the strike in Nowa Huta.   In the history of Poland's communist government, there has neverbeen a large-scale strike on May Day.   Before the start of the capital's May Day parade, Jaruzelskitold a rally, ``Our country is at a turning point now,'' referringto his economic programs.   Noting wage demands at a time when the annual inflation rate is42 percent, he said ``To give more, one has to take away fromsomebody else, or produce more.''   Giving in to unjustified wage demands ``would lead directly tothe infamous epoch of (only) vinegar on store shelves,'' he saidreferring to the time of shortages during the Solidarity upheaval.   He also stressed the Communist Party will remain in charge.   ``May nobody pin hopes on our fatigue,'' he said. ``There willbe no dismantling of the country's political foundations.''   At a rally in Warsaw, 6,000 people cheered and shouted sloganssupporting the strikers and condemning the government.   Some people tried to march from the rally in front of St.Stanislaw Kostka church to a nearby square, but police blockedthem. Truncheon-swinging officers fought briefly with somedemonstrators.   In other protests:   Police used clubs to disperse about 1,000 protesters who triedto march in the southwestern city of Wroclaw and a dozen peoplewere detained, said Solidarity spokesman Jozef Pinior.   In Dabrowa Gornicza in southwestern Poland, some worshippersattempted to march after a Mass attended by 2,000 people, saidPinior. He said police moved in and one Solidarity member wasbeaten.   In the central city of Plock, 5,000 people marched behindSolidarity banners for about a half-mile, Pinior said. Policescattered them and detained five people.</TEXT></DOC>
