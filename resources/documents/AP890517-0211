SANDI</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A court dropped charges againstAmerican-born rancher who has been linked to the Nicaraugan rebelsupply network, one of his attorneys said Wednesday.   John Hull was jailed Jan. 13 on charges of drug trafficking andviolating Costa Rican security. He was freed in early March afterhe posted $37,000 bail, pending his trial.   While in jail, the 69-year-old Hull had a heart attack and washospitalized for three weeks.   Defense attorney Juan Jose Sobrado said the ruling by a SuperiorPenal Court judge in Alajuela, just outside the capital, annulledan earlier ruling by another court in San Carlos, about 100 milesto the north.   Sobrado said the Alajuela judge reportedly cited a lack ofevidence when annulling the earlier San Carlos ruling, whichordered Hull jailed. The charges originally were filed in Alajuela,but the case was later moved to San Carlos.   Hull, of Evansville, Ind., has lived in Costa Rica for 20 yearsand owns a ranch in San Carlos. His lawyers say he became a CostaRican citizen eight years ago.   U.S. congressional witnesses have said Hull's ranch in CostaRica was a transshipment point for guns headed to the rebels inNicaragua and cocaine destined for the United States.   Hull has denied any role in the illegal drug trade and said hissupport of the Contra rebels was a patriotic gesture.   Another attorney for Hull, Rita Herrera, said she had notreceived an official copy of the court's ruling as of lateWedensday.   ``Officially we don't know anything, but we hope to have theofficial ruling tommorrow,'' Herrera said in a telephone interview.   Court officials in Alajuela could not be reached by telephonefor comment late Wednesday.   Herrera said Hull's case probably would be rejudged by the SanCarlos court.   ``It will start all over again,'' she said. ``But we are happyfor what we have achieved up to now.''</TEXT></DOC>
