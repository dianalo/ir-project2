This populationis determined to be a nonessential experimental population according tosection 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended. Section10(j) of the Act authorizes nonessential populations to be treated as ifthey were proposed species for the purposes of section 7. This releasesFederal agencies from the Act's prohibition against jeopardizing this populationby their actions. The yellowfin madtom once likely inhabited many of thelower gradient streams of the Tennessee River basin upstream of Chattanooga,Tennessee. Presently, populations are confined to only three stream reachesin the Tennessee River valley.

L. 97-304, was the creation of a provision (section 10(j))which provides for the designation of specific reintroduced populationsof listed species as nonessential experimental populations. Under previousauthorities in the Act, the Service was permitted to reintroduce populationsinto unoccupied portions of a listed species' historic range when it wouldfoster the conservation and recovery of the species. Local opposition toreintroduction efforts, however, stemming from concerns about the restrictionsand prohibitions on private and Federal activities contained in sections7 and 9 of the Act, severely handicapped the effectiveness of this as amanagement tool.Under section 10(j) of the 1982 Amendments, past and future reintroducedpopulations established outside the current range but within the species'historic range, may be designated, at the discretion of the Service, asexperimental populations or nonessential experimental populations. Experimentalpopulation status allows the Service to treat an endangered species asthreatened for the purposes of section 9 of the Act. Species listed asthreatened can be managed with greater flexibility, especially regardingincidental take and regulated taking. As the yellowfin madtom is alreadylisted as a threatened species with special rules (50 CFR 17.43), whichprovide that the fish may be taken in accordance with applicable Statelaw, the species' status relative to section 9 will remain the same forany introduced populations.Nonessential populations are experimental populations found to be nonessentialto the continued existence of the species. These populations are treatedas if the species were only proposed for listing under section 7 (exceptfor subsection (a)(1)). Therefore, they are not subject to the provisionsof section 7(a)(2) of the Act, which requires Federal agencies to ensurethat their activities are not likely to jeopardize the continued existenceof a listed species. However, two provisions of section 7 would apply onlands that are not within the National Wildlife Refuge System or NationalPark System: Section 7(a)(1), which authorizes all Federal agencies toestablish conservation programs, and section 7(a)(4), which requires Federalagencies to confer informally with the Service on actions that are likelyto jeopardize the continued existence of the species. Where the speciesoccurs on Refuge or Park System lands, all provisions of section 7 wouldapply. The organisms used to establish an experimental population willonly be removed from an existing source if (1) the removal will not jeopardizethe continued existence of the species and (2) a permit has been issuedfor the take of individuals from the donor population in accordance withthe requirements of 50 CFR 17.31.The yellowfin madtom was listed as a threatened species with critical habitaton September 9, 1977 (42 FR 45528). The species was probably once widelydistributed in many lower gradient streams of the Tennessee River drainageupstream of the Chattanooga, Tennessee, area (Jenkins 1975). The species'present distribution (Burkhead and Jenkins 1982, Shute 1984) is representedby only three known populations (Citico Creek, Monroe County, Tennessee;Powell River, Hancock County, Tennessee; and Copper Creek, Scott and RussellCounties, Virginia). Three other historic populations (Chickamauga Creek,Catoosa County, Georgia; Hines Creek, Anderson County, Tennessee; and NorthFork Holston River, Virginia) are believed to have been extirpated primarilydue to human-related factors (impoundments, pollution, habitat modification,etc.).The yellowfin madtom occupies small-to-medium-sized (25 to 135 feet wide)warm water streams with moderate current and clean water with little siltation(Jenkins 1975). The species is generally associated with cover (undersidesof flat rocks, detritus, and stream banks) (Jenkins 1975, Shute 1984).Good habitat for the yellowfin madtom is currently located in the NorthFork Holston River, Smyth, Washington, and Scott Counties, Virginia. Theestablishment of an experimental population in this now unoccupied historichabitat will greatly enhance the recovery potential of this species. Duringthe late summer or early fall of 1988 or 1989, 100 to 200 captive-rearedmadtoms (taken in the spring and summer of 1988 or 1989 from nests on CiticoCreek, Monroe County, Tennessee) will be reintroduced into one or two poolson the North Fork Holston River, Washington County, Virginia. The techniquesfor rearing and transplanting the species were developed in 1986 and 1987when a reintroduction was made into Abrams Creek, Blount County, Tennessee.The success of this introduction attempt is being evaluated. Based on studies conducted on the Citico Creek population (Shute 1984;David Etnier, Peggy Shute, and Randy Shute, University of Tennessee, personalcommunication, 1986), it is believed that approximately 125 yellowfin madtomnests exist in Citico Creek each year. The yellowfin madtom nests eachcontain about 90 eggs. Three to four nests would be taken, and, allowingfor natural mortality, these would yield the desired 100 to 200 individualsfor stocking. The removal of three to four nests represents only about3 percent of each year's total clutches. This amount of loss is well withinthe limits of natural loss that would likely occur on an average reproductiveyear (D. Etnier, P. Shute, and R. Shute, personal communication, 1986).Therefore, the Service has determined that the removal of the animals fromCitico Creek to be used in the North Fork Holston River transplant is notlikely to jeopardize the continued existence or viability of the CiticoCreek population. Furthermore, the creation of this experimental population,as proposed, will further the conservation of the species throughout itsrange. <ITAG tagnum="84">Status of Reintroduced Population </ITAG>This reintroduced population of yellowfin madtoms is being designated asa nonessential experimental population according to the provisions of section10(j) of the Act. The nonessential experimental population status, whichis necessary to gain the acceptance of the Virginia Commission of Gameand Inland Fisheries for the reintroduction effort, is appropriate forthe following reasons: Reproducing populations of the yellowfin madtompresently exist in three river reaches. The removal of individuals fromthe extant population in Citico Creek, Monroe County, Tennessee, is notexpected to adversely affect the viability of that population (see Backgroundsection above). Therefore, the loss of the introduced population wouldnot reduce the likelihood of the survival of the species in the wild. Infact, the anticipated success of this reintroduction will enhance the species'recovery potential by extending its current range and reoccupying currentlyunutilized historic habitat. <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations </ITAG>In the September 8, 1987, proposed rule (52 FR 33850) and associated notifications,all interested parties were requested to submit factual reports and informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate Stateand Federal agencies, county governments, scientific organizations, andinterested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Six writtencomments were received and are summarized below. Support for the proposal was received from the Tennessee Department ofConservation, U.S. Forest Service, and the Virginia Cooperative FisheryResearch Unit. The State of Virginia Department of Game and Inland Fisheriesand the Tennessee Valley Authority provided no specific comments, but didrequest that the Service inform them of the exact location of the transplantsite. The Service will coordinate the release of the fish with these agencies,and specific site data will be provided prior to the release. The Smyth County Board of Supervisors objected to the proposal to establisha nonessential experimental population of the yellowfin madtom in the NorthFork Holston River. However, they provided no reason for their objection.A Service biologist met with the Board and explained the proposed rulespecifically emphasizing the greatly reduced protection the Act providesto nonessential experimental populations. The Board voted again to opposethe reintroduction. The proposed rule stated that the yellowfin madtom would be introducedinto the North Fork Holston River in Smyth County, Virginia. Discussionwith ichthyologists knowledgeable with the species indicates that suitablesites for introduction are available downstream in Washington and ScottCounties, Virginia (Charles Sayler, Tennessee Valley Authority; David Etnier,University of Tennessee; and Robert Jenkins, personal communications, 1987).The Service has discussed the use of Washington County as a reintroductionsite with the Washington County Administrator, and he had no objectionto reintroducing the fish into his county. Therefore, because of SmythCounty's objection and the availability of suitable sites in WashingtonCounty, Virginia, the final rule has been modified to show that the reintroductionwill be made into North Fork Holston River in Washington County, Virginia,rather than Smyth County, Virginia. If the reintroduction is successfuland the species expands its range downstream and upstream in the NorthFork Holston River, the species could be considered for delisting beforeany of these fish ever reach Smyth County, Virginia. <ITAG tagnum="84">Location of Reintroduced Population </ITAG>The area for reintroduction of the yellowfin madtom is totally isolatedfrom existing populations of the species. The madtom will be released intothe North Fork Holston River, Washington County, Virginia. This site isseparated from other existing populations by both Tennessee River and tributaryreservoirs, and the fish is not known from any of these reservoirs or interveningriver sections. These reservoirs and river sections act as barriers tomovement by the fish and assure that the Holston River population willremain geographically isolated and easily identifiable as a distinct population.<ITAG tagnum="84">Management </ITAG>This translocation project will be a joint cooperative effort among theVirginia Commission of Game and Inland Fisheries, the Tennessee WildlifeResources Agency, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Present planscall for the release of 100 to 200 young-of-the-year animals in the latesummer or early fall of 1988. Subsequent releases will be made contingenton funds in 1989 and later years. Released animals will be monitored todetermine survival, reproductive success, and general health. This nonessential experimental population would be treated as a threatenedspecies under all provisions of the Act, except section 7. Under section7 (other than subsection (a)(1) thereof) a nonessential experimental populationshall be treated, except when it occurs in an area of the National WildlifeRefuge or National Park Systems, as a species proposed to be listed underthe Act as a threatened species. All of the prohibitions referred to in50 CFR 17.31 would apply to this population. In addition, members of thisexperimental population could be taken in accordance with applicable Statelaws. Thus, if a fisherman accidentally took a member of this experimentalpopulation based upon a misidentification of the species, there would beno violation of Federal law. <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>An environmental assessment under the National Environmental Policy Acthas been prepared and is available to the public at the Service's AshevilleField Office (see <T2>``Addresses''</T2> section), Atlanta Regional Office (U.S. Fish andWildlife Service, Richard B. Russell Federal Building, 75 Spring StreetSW., Atlanta, Georgia 30303), or the Division of Endangered Species andHabitat Conservation, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 1000 N. Glebe Road,Arlington, Virginia 22201 (202/235-1975). This assessment formed the basisfor the decision that this is not a major Federal action which would significantlyaffect the quality of the human environment within the meaning of section102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (implementedat 40 CFR Parts 1500-1508). <ITAG tagnum="85">Executive Order 12291, Paperwork Reduction Act, and Regulatory FlexibilityAct </ITAG>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that this is not a majorrule as defined by Executive Order 12291 and that the rule would not havea significant economic effect on a substantial number of small entitiesas described in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (Pub. L. 96-354). No privateentities will be affected by this action. The rule does not contain anyinformation collection or record keeping requirements as defined in thePaperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-511). <ITAG tagnum="84">References Cited </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Burkhead, N.M., and R.E. Jenkins. 1982.
