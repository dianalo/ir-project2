An engineer at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, in Troy, N.Y., has devised a method for mixing two polymers to improve the properties of plastic products.    Chemical engineer E. Bruce Nauman calls the new process &quot;compositional quenching.&quot; Two polymers that, like oil and water, don't ordinarily mix are dissolved together in a common solvent, stirred to a homogenous emulsion and heated under pressure. When the pressure is suddenly released, the solvent evaporates, leaving behind a material in which microscopic spheres of one polymer are evenly dispersed throughout the other.    With the process, engineers can add a resilient polymer like rubber to a plastic, making it less brittle and less likely to crack or shatter. It also can produce a high-impact plastic for an auto body, a television set or a football helmet that is as strong as present plastics but has a long-lasting, glossy finish comparable to that of painted metal.    Mr. Nauman has been working with mixing &quot;unmixable&quot; polymers in different ratios to produce entirely new properties in plastic materials. He says, for instance, it may be possible to produce a material that is structurally strong but has the absorbency of a sponge. Meanwhile, Borg Warner Corp., a Chicago-based services, chemicals and automotive concern, has taken a license on the process; the company declines to comment on its plans.    Crime sleuths get a boost from biotechnology in identifying human blood and semen. Researchers at the University of Virginia, partially funded by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, are developing monoclonal antibodies for police crime laboratories. A monoclonal antibody is a laboratory version of what the body produces to fend off invasions of &quot;foreign&quot; proteins such as those carried by viruses, bacteria or another person's tissues. Each monoclonal antibody identifies and attacks a specific protein and no other.    A monoclonal antibody that can identify a protein unique to human blood has been developed by cell biologist John Herr and his colleagues at the university's lymphocyte culture center. Unlike present tests it can distinguish human blood stains from animal blood. It also holds promise of standardizing blood tests used by police laboratories, Dr. Herr says. At present, there are lab-to-lab variations in forensic blood tests, he explains.    A second monoclonal antibody identifies a previously undiscovered protein unique to human semen and can be used to confirm sexual assault. It can replace or supplement present tests which are equivocal if the rapist is sterile, if the semen sample is too small or if it has been contaminated with certain vaginal secretions.    Test kits for police laboratories and hospitals are being developed by Humagen Inc., a closely held Charlottesville, Va., company formed by the Virginia scientists and New York venture capitalists.    More eggs per hen might be garnered in a new, more humane way. Egg producers long have known that an aging hen's declining egg production can be revived if the hen molts, that is, undergoes a period of losing and regrowing its feathers. So, many egg producers try to force hens to molt by withholding feed -- a practice that has been attacked by humane societies and is banned in some European countries. It's also expensive in terms of feed needed to restore the hen to health.    Now a drug that induces molting has been discovered by physiologist Janice Bahr and her colleagues at the University of Illinois Champaign-Urbana campus. They reason that molting occurs when the hen's reproductive system shuts down for a rejuvenating rest. The new drug turns off the hen's reproductive system, giving it a rejuvenating rest.    The new drug, chemically similar to a brain hormone, causes the chicken's pituitary gland to stop triggering ovulation. Hens implanted with a slow-releasing version of the drug stopped laying within a day, began molting 14 days later and resumed laying six weeks after the implant. Their egg production climbed 9% above pre-implant levels while a control group of hens' production dropped 10%. No harmful side effects were found.    The researchers are now working on ways of administering the drug through feed or water, which would open its use commercially. Ultimately, the researchers say they want to find a way to maintain the hen's egg production without molting. </TEXT></DOC>
