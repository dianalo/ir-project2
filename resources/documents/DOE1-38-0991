The observedincrease in atmospheric CO{sub 2} content is less than the estimatedrelease from fossil fuel consumption and deforestation. This discrepancycan be explained by interactions between the atmosphere and other globalcarbon reservoirs such as the oceans, and the terrestrial biosphere includingsoils. Undoubtedly, the oceans have been the most important sinks forCO{sub 2} produced by man. But, the physical, chemical, and biologicalprocesses of oceans are complex and, therefore, credible estimates ofCO{sub 2} uptake can probably only come from mathematical models. Unfortunately,one- and two-dimensional ocean models do not allow for enough CO{sub2} uptake to accurately account for known releases. Thus, they producehigher concentrations of atmospheric CO{sub 2} than was historicallythe case. More complex three-dimensional models, while currently beingdeveloped, may make better use of existing tracer data than do one- andtwo-dimensional models and will also incorporate climate feedback effectsto provide a more realistic view of ocean dynamics and CO{sub 2} fluxes.The instability of current models to estimate accurately oceanic uptakeof CO{sub 2} creates one of the key uncertainties in predictions of atmosphericCO{sub 2} increases and climate responses over the next 100 to 200 years.60 refs., 1 fig., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
