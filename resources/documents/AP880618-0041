At least 20 others were injured.   The gunman was hit in the arm by return fire from Ozal'sbodyguards and then arrested. Ankara Gov. Saffet Arikan Beduk said16 other people were wounded by gunfire and four were trampled inthe panic after the attack.   Ozal's doctor, Cengiz Aslan, told reporters a bullet enteredthrough Ozal's right thumb and exited from the palm. The woundrequired three stitches and the premier was in good condition, hesaid.   State television showed a picture of the gunmen at a hospitaland asked anyone who knew him to come forward and identify him topolice.   The wounded include Labor Minister Imren Aykut, who sufferedscratches on her face, and one Motherland Party member ofParliament, Beduk said. Two of the wounded required surgery butwere in satisfactory condition, he said.   It was not immediately clear if the gunfire that hit some of thewounded came from police or the gunman.   A police official at the scene, who requested anonymity, saidthe first bullet fired by the gunman hit the microphone in front ofOzal and the second one hit his right thumb.   Ozal took cover immediately behind the lectern when he heard theshots, Anatolia said. Delegates and others inside the Ataturkconvention hall also took cover, it said.   ``I saw the gunman take careful aim at the premier and fire athim twice,'' Eyup Asik, a deputy chairman of the party, told theagency.   Interior Minister Mustafa Kalemli said the captured gunman gavetwo different names to police and was insisting he acted alone. Hesaid the gunman first said his name was Hayati Ipek, then changedthis to Kartal, which means eagle in Turkish.   Despite his injury, Ozal returned to the floor to continue hisspeech.   ``No one can take away the life given by God except Godhimself,'' Ozal said.   The delegates gave him a long standing ovation after thisstatement.   The injured were taken to a nearby hospital, but theiridentities were not released.   Later today, the delegates were expected to re-elect Ozal asparty chairman. There were no other candidates running against him.   Ozal returned Wednesday from a historic three-day vist toGreece, the first Turkish premier to visit its traditionallyhostile neighbor in 36 years.   No solutions to major disputes between Greece and Turkey emergedfrom his talks with Greek Premier Andreas Papandreou, but bothleaders said they wanted to continue their dialogue.   The longtime enemies have clashed over several issues, includingthe Aegean Sea and the island of Cyprus.   Cyprus has been divided into separate Greek Cypriot and TurkishCypriot sectors since Turkey invaded in 1974 after anAthens-inspired coup aimed at uniting the island with Greece.   In March 1987, Greece and Turkey came to the brink of war overoil-drilling rights in the Aegean seabed.   On Thursday, a court sentenced a Greek chemist to four months injail for throwing a tomato at Ozal's car on the last day of hisvisit to Greece. The chemist said he was angry about Ozal's visit.   In today's speech to the delegates, Ozal emphasized theimportance of political stability, saying the last decade, marredby terrorism and an economic crisis, was a lost decade for Turkey.   Ozal defended his record and recent economic austerity measures.He said he was not interested in short-term designs and was lookingahead to the year 2000.   He was first elected when a military government ceded power in1983.   The 61-year-old premier conceded that Turkey suffers from 75percent inflation but pledged to halve the inflation rate within ayear.</TEXT></DOC>
