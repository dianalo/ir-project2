That wasn't enough to convince Sen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio,who criticized other oil companies for passing up an invitation toappear Monday before his Energy subcommittee on energy regulationand conservation.   ``You have an amazing burden of proof to convince the Americanpeople that the oil companies didn't exploit the Valdez accident,''Metzenbaum said. ``I also invited Arco, Mobil, Chevron, BP, Texaco,Shell and Amoco, and I regret their failure to appear.''   In the three weeks following the spill, gasoline prices jumped10 to 30 cents a gallon across the country.   Tracy Stanton, a Shell service station owner in Columbus, Ohio,said in his 20 years of business he has never seen such a rapidincrease in gasoline prices in such a short period of time,including during the Arab oil embargo of the 1970s.   J.T. McMillan, senior vice president of Exxon, told the Senatesubcommittee: ``The idea that Exxon raised prices to profit fromthat spill is completely unfounded. The marketplace will not permitany unusual costs incurred by a particular supplier, like the costsnecessary to clean up the oil spill in Alaska, to be recovered inthe marketplace.''   Although the Alaskan oil spill temporarily affected the price ofcrude oil to the West Coast, the price of gasoline has beenincreasing for several months overall because the cost of crude oilhas been rising, he said.   W. Henson Moore, deputy secretary of the Department of Energy,agreed with McMillan that prices had been rising before theaccident.   Moore said that the spill and the oil lost because of thefive-day shutdown of shipping from Prince William Sound amounted toabout 13 million barrels, but he said the loss ``had no lasting orpermanent effect on gasoline prices.''   The oncoming summer driving season, increased regulations,higher cost imports and added excise taxes were other contributorsto higher prices, McMillan said.   Metzenbaum and others on the panel pressed the energy deputysecretary for a deeper explanation of increasing prices, but hesaid complete data were unavailable and the department was stillanalyzing the situation.   Stanton, the service station operator from Ohio, blamed ``oilcompany greed'' and the control the major oil companies have gainedat the refinery level and by increasing their number ofcompany-operated service stations. Stanton is the former presidentof the Service Station Dealers of America.   The senator criticized Exxon's plan to deduct the costs ofcleaning up the spill from the taxes they pay the federalgovernment.   ``For every dollar they (Exxon) spend, the taxpayer will pick up34 cents,'' said Metzenbaum. ``Why shouldn't Exxon foot the bill?''   Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., has introduced a bill that wouldprevent the deductions, which Exxon said were a legitimate businessloss allowed in the tax code as a deduction.</TEXT></DOC>
