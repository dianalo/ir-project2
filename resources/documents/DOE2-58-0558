Graphite oxidationtemperatures were found to be lowered by more than 100degC in presenceof PuO/sub 2/ showing significant catalysis of graphite oxidation byPuO/sub 2/. The catalytic effect is unlikely to be due to cyclic conversionof oxide from Pu(IV) to Pu(III) oxidation state. (author). 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
