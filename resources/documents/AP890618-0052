The death toll was nearly double that reported in 1987, theInternational Confederation of Free Trade Unions said in an annualsurvey citing anti-union actions in 79 countries.   The most brutal repression occurred in Latin America,particularly in Colombia, the survey said. Repression of unions inAfrica continues to cause concern, it said.   The survey also cited ``harsh repression'' of workers trying toform independent unions in communist Romania, violations of laborrights in Turkey and rising government interference in collectivebargaining in Denmark, Iceland and the Netherlands.   The Brussels-based group distributed the report during theInternational Labor Organization's annual conference in Geneva.   The survey said ``working people continue to be denied basicfreedoms in all parts of the world.''   In extreme cases, it said, activists work ``under the constantthreat of assassination, disappearance, detention and torture,''while legal and administrative curbs on unions cause increasingconcern.   The confederation's general secretary, John Vanderveken, calledfor stronger government action ``to halt the rising tide ofpersecution of trade unionists.''   Some 500 were believed slain in Colombia in 1988. The surveyblamed the almost daily killings and disappearances on paramilitarygroups, guerrillas and hired killers linked to drug traffickers andlandowners.   In El Salvador, more than 20 union members were killed in thepast year, the report said. Union offices were often searched andpolice regularly broke up demonstrations, it said.   Brazil offered a ``demonstration of government indifference tounion repression'' when Chico Mendes, an internationally-known unionleader and environmentalist, was slain Dec. 22, the survey said.   South Africa was criticized for last September's tough LaborRelations Amendment Act, described as a new move against theindepedent black trade union movement.   Respect for trade union rights has lagged behind other democraticreforms in some Asian countries such as South Korea, the report said.   Turkey's labor laws still violate many basic rights, includingthe right to strike and collective bargaining, the survey said.   Moves by Britain's Conservative government in the past year todismiss the remaining trade unionists at its intelligence-gatheringcenter, the Government Communications Headquarters, were said to be``in flagrant violation of freedom of association.''   The confederation is an umbrella for 142 national trade uniongroups in 97 countries that represent 88 million workers.</TEXT></DOC>
