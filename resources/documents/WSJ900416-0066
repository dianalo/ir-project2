Why? The conventional wisdom isthat labor is a fixed factor because workers do not want tomove. Only those compelled by economic necessity (orpolitical repression) will leave home.   But this view is surely wrong. It is roughly equivalent tosaying that the poor have no taste for luxury goods andtherefore do not buy them. If labor is such a naturallyimmobile factor, why do we need stringent laws inhibitingimmigration? In fact, workers are prevented from exploitingthe full potential of their labor by formal and informalbarriers to transnational mobility.</LP><TEXT>   Mobility restrictions are least severe for the mostunskilled workers (who may migrate clandestinely) and for thevery top of the management ladder. But for employees in thebroad middle categories of semi-skilled, skilled and educatedlabor, the barriers are highly limiting.   The problem of mobility is not the same as that ofpermanent immigration. A Briton who wants to work for a fewyears in Italy does not necessarily want to become anItalian. He may just want to make more money, or live inTurin for a while or broaden his professional outlook.   After 1992, Britons will be able to work in Italy withoutobtaining visas. But Americans won't -- nor will Italians befree to work in the U.S. But imagine a new regime in whichworkers would be free to move in search of work, whileremaining citizens of their home countries.   The great differences in level of development, incomes andlabor histories and expectations -- not to mention nationalpolitical and security considerations -- might make itunrealistic, at first, to extend such broad mobility to everycountry. But what objection could there be to such anarrangement among the most developed countries -- say, the 24members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation andDevelopment? Roughly comparable levels of development, livingstandards, protection of workers' rights and shareddemocratic political traditions suggest great possibilitiesfor cross-national mobility among these countries. The worldmight then re-create the kind of freedom to move acrossborders that once characterized the Roman world or theAtlantic community of the 18th century.   To achieve this freedom, simple repeal of formal barrierswill not suffice. Just as free trade has had to beaccompanied by measures to harmonize tax laws, insuranceregulations, product safety standards, copyright and patentrules and a host of other informal obstacles, so labormobility would require the removal of informal obstacles.That means:   -- A simple and quick system for issuing work visas,similar to the system that now exists for tourist visas.   -- Recognition of foreign qualifications. What is neededis not some supra-national bureaucratic classification systemthat is unlikely to be effective anyway, but rather a way tomake skills internationally transferable by making themtransparent and translatable.   -- Clear information about and quick access to socialsecurity coverage. (In most OECD countries, social securityalso includes health care.) Workers who consider migratingface intimidating uncertainty about their rights andeligibilities under nationally operated social securitysystems. These systems are highly bureaucratic and difficultto deal with, and even though in recent years variousbilateral treaties have been reached to ensure that migratingworkers receive proper credit for pension payments, manyforeign workers, one suspects, simply have their &quot;voluntary&quot;contributions deducted from their paychecks and nevercollect.   Simple lack of information is one problem. Providingproper documentation is another. Why not equip workers with&quot;social security passports&quot; that would be universallyaccepted as documentation, and credit their payments toworkers' homecountry retirement accounts?   National governments have restricted the geographicalfreedom of workers. Practical reforms can roll back theserestrictions. Geographic mobility ought to be thought of asone of the most fundamental freedoms for labor, as it was forthe serfs who struggled centuries ago for the right to workwhere they chose.   ---   Mr. Edwards is chairman of the economics department at theUniversity of Massachusetts, Amherst.</TEXT></DOC>
