And the specter of such difficulties has the defense bar protesting loudly.    At the heart of the debate is the Comprehensive Forfeiture Act of 1984, which says the government may seek to freeze allegedly tainted assets prior to conviction in cases involving federal narcotics charges or criminal charges filed under the Racketeer-Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO). Designed to protect assets subject to forfeiture in the event of a conviction, the freeze law has frequently been invoked in cases involving mobsters and drug traffickers.    But the law doesn't address whether defendants may use those assets to hire an attorney, and this has proved to be a major point of contention. For a time, defense lawyers prevailed in the lower courts, arguing that extending the freeze to money needed for legal fees tramples the constitutional right to a fair trial and counsel of choice, as well as undermines the presumption of innocence.    In recent months, however, several district and circuit courts have upheld the freeze for legal fees. Now considerable legal attention is being paid to a pending decision on the matter by all 12 members of the influential Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, sitting in New York.    Defense lawyers are worried that a precedent set by the Second Circuit would encourage prosecutors to apply the statute to a broader range of cases, including those involving white-collar crime.    The government &quot;likes to paint this as though they're just after mobsters and drug traffickers,&quot; says Edward Chikofsky, an adjunct professor at Fordham University law school who brought the issue before the Second Circuit as a voluntary appeal on behalf of a drug-case defendant. &quot;But it applies to everyone accused under RICO.&quot; A criminal RICO indictment can be brought against anyone accused of a &quot;pattern&quot; of illegal activity, which can mean as few as two related criminal charges in the same indictment.    Among the problems Mr. Chikofsky sees arising from freezes is a straining of lawyer-client relationships. Such was apparently the experience of E. Robert Wallach, former counsel to Attorney General Edwin Meese and one of the first white-collar defendants to feel the chill of the statute's power. Within hours after Mr. Wallach and Franklyn Chinn were indicted last December on racketeering charges in the Wedtech influence-peddling case, the government obtained orders freezing the bank accounts, brokerage accounts, partnership interests and property of the two men.    Ted Wells, Mr. Wallach's lawyer on the day of the indictment, dropped his client by the time of the arraignment. People familiar with the case say that Mr. Wells's decision was a result of the freeze; Mr. Wells declines to comment. Mr. Wallach, who has denied the charges against him, was able to hire other counsel, presumably with funds untouched by the freeze.    Mr. Chinn's lawyer, Cristina Arguedas, says she is working &quot;without assurance we'll be paid.&quot; If her appeal to get her client's assets unfrozen fails, she won't be able to defend him at trial, she says.    Ms. Arguedas contends that the government seems to &quot;pick and choose&quot; the cases in which the freeze is invoked, passing over those in which the defendant pleads guilty. &quot;Frank asserts his innocence,&quot; she says, &quot;so they don't want him to have a private lawyer.&quot;    Defense lawyers worry, too, about waning incentive to pursue criminal defense, since the law can also force surrender of fees paid to attorneys where a trial shows the funds were ill-gotten. Twenty years ago, the quality of the criminal-defense bar was often poor because &quot;there wasn't any money in it,&quot; says William Genego, a professor at the University of Southern California Law Center.    But the explosion in high-stakes drug and racketeering cases in recent years has &quot;really enhanced the quality&quot; of the bar, Mr. Genego says, because of the monetary rewards in defending wealthy criminals. He fears that giving a green light to the statute may &quot;lead to the elimination of the private (criminal-defense) bar.&quot;    Arthur Liman, who last month addressed the Second Circuit on behalf of several defense lawyers' organizations, agrees that if the statute isn't rewritten, it will be much tougher to get private lawyers to handle RICO cases. Mr. Liman, formerly president of the Legal Aid Society, a group of public defenders, says low-paid public defenders couldn't shoulder the burden of such cases, &quot;which are usually lengthy and complicated.&quot;    At the same Second Circuit hearing, Mr. Chikofsky argued that, since the law's purpose is to separate criminals from their gains, it shouldn't matter whether assets go to the government or to a lawyer. If the statute does bar payments to lawyers, he reasoned, it isn't constitutional.    The U.S. Attorney's office, which declined to comment for this article, responded in briefs that anyone too poor to hire a lawyer will be given one by the courts. It also said that the right to counsel of choice is &quot;qualified,&quot; and that such a right is outweighed by government interest in having assets available for forfeiture.    In his brief, Assistant U.S. Attorney John Savarese declared that the law wasn't intended to provide the government &quot;with a merely tactical weapon to deploy against disfavored counsel.&quot; Rather, it was to &quot;vindicate the public's pressing interest in preventing narcotics traffickers from wielding illegitimate economic power accumulated&quot; through crime.    But to many, including U.S. Circuit Judge James L. Oakes, who dissented in an earlier hearing of the drug case now under consideration, the freeze law &quot;provides the government with a negative, indeed an unwholesome, power over the defendant's choice of counsel in the very type of complex criminal case where astute, experienced counsel is most needed.&quot;    The government says that power is now checked in the Second Circuit by special mandatory hearings at which the government, to maintain a freeze, must demonstrate the likelihood of prevailing at trial. Such hearings were deemed necessary by a three-judge Second Circuit panel last December. </TEXT></DOC>
