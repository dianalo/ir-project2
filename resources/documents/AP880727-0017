As a result, the Pentagon's 5-year-old weapons testing programstill cannot adequately assess whether weapons would work incombat, the General Accounting Office says.   The GAO review deals with the Pentagon's Office of OperationalTest and Evaluation, which was created by Congress in 1983 in anattempt to do a more realistic job of testing weapons.   The legislation was triggered by the discovery of serious flawsin several major weapons systems after they were well intodevelopment.   The GAO report was released Tuesday by the CongressionalMilitary Reform Caucus, a group of 140 legislators who bandedtogether in 1981 to seek management changes in the federalgovernment's largest single agency.   Rep. Charles Bennett, D-Fla., a caucus member, told DefenseSecretary Frank C. Carlucci the Pentagon had ignored Congress'orders to test weapons realistically.   ``Congress cannot depend on the realism of the weapons tests, orthe independence of the testing reports we receive,'' said Bennett.   Carlucci, appearing at a House Armed Services Committee hearing,said he hadn't seen the report and couldn't comment on itsspecifics.   But he then went on to criticize what he said is ``an increasingtendency on the part of members of Congress'' to seek GAO reviewswithout giving the Pentagon a chance to review the reports beforethey are released.   Dan Howard, Carlucci's spokesman, was even more critical. ``Thedifficulty is that those (members of Congress) who do not wish toinform themselves, who very carefully guard their ignorance,obviously are not going to learn about the details of our testingprograms,'' he said.   Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., a co-sponsor of the 1983 legislation,said: ``I am disappointed, but hardly surprised. I have never seenevidence of any desire by the Pentagon or this administration tomake this office work as we in Congress intended it to work.''   The GAO reviewed the Pentagon's test of six major weapons,including the Navy's Aegis air defense. That is the sophisticatedtracking system involved in the July 3 shootdown by the Navycruiser Vincennes of an Iranian jetliner in the Persian Gulf. ThePentagon says the ship thought it was firing at an Iranian F-14 andis investigating the incident.   The other weapons in the GAO study were the Army's Aquila droneplane; the Army's helicopter improvement program; Navy Tomahawkconventional cruise missile; the newest targeting system for theAir Force Maverick missile; and the Air Force LANTIRN system fornight-time targeting.   The GAO concluded that there were ``significant problems andlimitations in the planning, execution, realism, analysis, andservice test agency reporting of the six'' programs. Some of theseproblems and limitations ``were unavoidable due to time, resourceor safety constraints, although numerous others were not.''   The GAO study said the Pentagon hadn't followed congressionalorders to make the tests as realistic and combat-like as possible.   For example, ``the prevailing problem for operational users wasthat they were selected from an operator pool that was atypicallyhigh in skill or experience level _ that is, so-called `goldencrews,''' the review said.   Another example: In some instances contractors were permitted tohelp military crews maintain the weapons ``although that contractorsupport would not be available in the field.''   The problem was compounded by the fact that test data was oftenmisread, the GAO said. ``In five of six cases, we found problemswith the various assumptions underlying the analyses of the testdata. In at least two cases, such assumptions led to overlyoptimistic estimates of the system's capability, one of which wascontracted by available data.''   There were other ``questionable practices'' in interpreting dataand their impact ``was significant,'' the GAO said. ``Theyfrequently allowed a system to appear to meet its performancerequirements.''   Flaws cited by the report included the fact that crews used forboth the Army helicopter tests and Maverick tests were specificallytrained for the tests, rather than being normal crews; and tests ofthe Tomahawk occurred only over pre-tested flight routes.</TEXT></DOC>
