The first of three tritium-producing reactors at the department'sSavannah River complex near Aiken, S.C., will begin low-powertesting late next summer, and production is expected to startbetween October and December 1990, Energy Secretary James D. Watkinssaid Thursday after briefing White House officials on the plan.   Watkins said precise dates for the restart schedule will not beset before next April after department officials review progress ina broad management and mechanical overhaul under way at SavannahRiver since last fall.   The three active reactors at Savannah River _ designated K, L andP _ are the nation's only source of tritium, a manmade hydrogenisotope used to boost the destructive power of nuclear weapons. Allthree have been out of operation since spring 1988.   Environmental groups criticized the announcement, saying it meansthe reactors will be back in operation before all safety questionsare answered.   ``The Energy Department is certainly not putting safety first _restart is still No. 1,'' said Brian Costner, director of the EnergyResearch Foundation, a Columbia, S.C.-based group that wants thereactors closed down permanently.   Costner's organization joined the environmental groups Greenpeaceand Natural Resources Defense Council in suing the Energy Departmentin December to force Watkins to complete an environmental impactstatement before restarting the reactors. Costner said in atelephone interview that the suit will proceed.   Watkins said he had briefed the National Security Council on theplan prepared by Westinghouse Savannah River Co., which operates thereactors under a government contract.   ``There are still uncertainties'' about getting the reactorsrunning again on the proposed schedule, Watkins said, so a preciserestart timetable isn't ready. He didn't identify the remainingproblems, but Westinghouse has said it is undertaking a wide-rangingprogram of safety improvements.   J.L. Gallagher, the Westinghouse manager in charge of the restarteffort, told an Energy Department advisory group Wednesday thecompany was committed to safe operations with a ``balanced,experienced mixture of people'' on the job.   Westinghouse took over management of the site in April from E.I.du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co., which had run the plant since it was builtin the early 1950s.   Watkins has faced some congressional pressure to further studythe environmental implications of restarting the Savannah Riverreactors, but he also is under pressure from the Pentagon to resumeproduction of tritium before existing stockpiles run so low thatweapons systems must be cannibalized.   Tritium decays at a rate of 5.5 percent annually and thus must beregularly replenished to keep the U.S. nuclear arsenal in a state offull readiness.   Watkins' restart target of roughly September 1990 is a delay ofmore than two years from an August 1988 incident at one of theSavannah River reactors that triggered a shutdown of the wholecomplex while safety and management issues were reviewed. Theshutdown initially was expected to last only a matters of weeks, butrestart was continually set back as more problems were discovered.   The K reactor that Watkins said would be restarted first has beenidle since April 1988. The reactor suffered ruptured valves in itsbackup cooling system last January when operators mishandled aroutine pressure test. The incident raised new questions aboutoperating procedures at the plant and led to additional demands onWestinghouse to improve training of reactor operators and otherworkers.   Westinghouse recently confirmed that it had proposed to Watkinsthat the K reactor be restarted in September 1990 but that theenergy secretary had pressed for an earlier date.   Meanwhile, the Energy Department said Thursday it will put one ofthe two plants producing uranium fuel for naval reactors on standbybecause less fuel is needed these days. The plant is at the SavannahRiver site, where some 600 affected employees will be absorbed intoother projects.   The only other plant producing fuel for reactors that drivenuclear powered warships is operated by Nuclear Fuel Services Inc.at Erwin, Tenn. The department said the Erwin plant can supply theNavy's entire needs.</TEXT></DOC>
