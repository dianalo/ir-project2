More than 9,400 Greyhound employees represented by theAmalgamated Council of Greyhound Local Unions, the ATU'sbargaining unit, have been on strike since March 2.</LP><TEXT>   On Monday, NLRB General Counsel Jerry Hunter authorizedthe issuance of a complaint alleging that Greyhound, a unitof Dallas-based GLI Holding Co., unilaterally implementedsome of its contract proposals before reaching a bargainingimpasse with the union. &quot;The complaint will also allege thatthe current strike is an unfair labor practice strike,&quot; theNLRB said in a news release.   If unfair bargaining practices and not economic issues arefound to have caused the strike, Greyhound could be forced torehire thousands of striking ATU drivers it has replaced withnew hires since the strike began. The company has said that,even if a settlement is reached, it has jobs for only a fewhundred of the nearly 6,000 ATU drivers still out.   Though no new bargaining talks have been scheduled, EdwardStrait, president of the ATU's Amalgamated Council, said ATUlocal presidents would discuss offering to go back to workunder the terms of their now-expired contract at a meetingMay 21. Mr. Strait said that if Greyhound turns down such anoffer the company might eventually be forced to pay strikingdrivers back pay if the NLRB general counsel's complaint isupheld.   &quot;This could be quite costly to them down the road,&quot; Mr.Strait said.   Still, the ultimate resolution of the NLRB complaint couldbe years away. Both sides will now argue the complaint beforea federal administrative law judge. The judge's decision canbe appealed by either party to the entire labor relationsboard and their decision can, in turn, be appealed throughthe federal courts.   &quot;We are confident we will prevail,&quot; said GreyhoundExecutive Vice President P. Anthony Lannie. &quot;We will appealall the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, should that becomenecessary.&quot;   Meanwhile, Greyhound officials said they were pleased thatMr. Hunter, the NLRB general counsel, also authorized theissuance of a second complaint, this one alleging that theunion had engaged in violence and other forms of misconductduring the strike. Mr. Hunter said he had obtained clearancefrom the board to seek a federal court injunction enjoiningthe union from such conduct nationwide.   Since the strike began, Greyhound has spent more than $4million on legal fees to obtain such injunctions andrestraining orders in individual cities and states. Theincreased costs of legal fees and security were among thereasons Greyhound cited for a $55.8 million net loss duringthe first quarter. The debt-burdened company is currentlynegotiating with creditors and lenders on a financialrestructuring.</TEXT></DOC>
