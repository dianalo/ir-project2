Apparently, Iraq deliberately opened the valves in theKuwaiti oil refineries and caused an unprecedented outpouringof oil into the waters. The 35-mile-long, 10-mile-wide&quot;spill&quot; is at least 10 times the size of the Valdez oil spillin Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989.</LP><TEXT>   The Gulf has a much shallower average depth than U.S.coastal waters, and therefore a smaller volume of water toabsorb the oil. The current episode is a true environmentaldisaster. The pictures of the dying cormorants, with theircoats of thick, black sludge, are pitiful. The glassy-eyeddead ducks must arouse the hardest heart. And we can expectthe demise of many sea turtles, dolphins and other creatures.There is also the threat to Saudi Arabia'swater-desalinization plants.   Under the circumstances, I am impelled to ask why are thenormally shrill voices of the environmental activists somute? A genuine accident in the U.S. normally will arouse atleast one group of ecologists to fever-pitch activity. Howcome the &quot;intentional&quot; fouling of the environment on thelargest scale ever escapes their attention? Greenpeace, whereare you now that we need you?   Where is the mass picketing of the Iraqi embassies? Whereis any expression of outrage by environmentalists over thisenvironmental calamity? If an oil spill half the size of thecurrent disaster had been caused by accidental U.S. activityin the Persian Gulf, would not the environmental activistshave taken to the streets?   My criticism is not aimed at the rank and file of themajor environmental organizations. The concern about the airwe breathe and the water we drink is virtually universal, andnonpartisan. But it surely seems that a double standard ismaintained by the &quot;leadership&quot; of the environmental movement:Accidental pollution in capitalistic institutions is attackedvehemently; deliberate pollution by totalitarian regimes isignored.
