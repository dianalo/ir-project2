But, in a confirmation hearing for the attorney general nominee, lawmakers asked Mr. Thornburgh to assure them that he would turn over the 1975 agency report that, among other things, detailed narcotics trafficking involving senior Panamanian military and government officials.    &quot;I think that we need and have the right to know what's in that report,&quot; said Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D., Ariz.). He said he has tried unsuccessfully for years to obtain the material. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R., Utah) maintained that the report was &quot;denied to this committee all these years.&quot; He said release of the information would help reveal &quot;once and for all&quot; Panamanian government complicity in drug-trafficking dating back to the 1970s.    Although the Panama issue continues to be hotly debated, the dispute over the report won't affect Mr. Thornburgh's confirmation, which could come as early as Thursday.    The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that Mr. Thornburgh participated in a March 1976 meeting at which, according to a memo written by a department aide, officials &quot;decided that we should continue to resist disclosing to Congress&quot; parts of the report while related investigations were pending.    At the hearing, Democrats and Republicans on the panel specifically asked the nominee about the meeting, but he called their concerns &quot;groundless.&quot; Mr. Thornburgh, who took charge of the criminal division in July 1975 under President Ford, said that a reading of the memo alone creates an &quot;erroneous impression,&quot; and that the Journal article didn't represent the full story.    Regarding any effort to withhold the report, Mr. Thornburgh said he couldn't &quot;speak with any assurance as to why {then-} Attorney General {Edward} Levi may have made a decision to withhold information . . . I made no such decision. It was not my province to make that kind of decision.&quot;    He asserted that Mr. Levi &quot;was the initiator and actor and responder&quot; to lawmakers' requests for the report and related papers. Mr. Thornburgh pledged that he would provide the Judiciary Committee with the documents as long as they don't jeopardize national security or pending criminal investigations. Mr. Levi couldn't be reached for comment.    Although the report remains classified, some members of congressional committees have seen parts of it. At the hearing Friday, for example, Mr. Thornburgh said the Justice Department showed the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations &quot;all of the requested material&quot; relating to the report. He didn't spell out what the committee saw, however.    Also during the hearing, part of which was devoted to discussing ethics at the Justice Department, Mr. Thornburgh criticized the report issued by independent prosecutor James McKay suggesting Attorney General Edwin Meese probably violated federal laws. Mr. Thornburgh said that if a prosecutor declines to seek criminal charges, it isn't appropriate &quot;to pass on gratuitous observations about the alleged guilt or innocence of the subject of the investigation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
