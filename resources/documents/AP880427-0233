Provincial elections Tuesday gave the Progressive Conservatives25 of the legislature's 57 seats, the Liberal Party 20 seats andthe incumbent socialist New Democratic Party 12.   The New Democrats controlled Manitoba for 15 of the past 19years. Polls had forecast their defeat, however, because of chargesthey mishandled the government-run auto insurance plan and othercorporations owned by the province.   Premier Howard Pawley had to call the election after losing avote of confidence last month and chose not to seek re-election inhis own district. His successor, Gary Doer, could not revive theparty's fortunes. It won 23 percent of the vote compared with 41percent in 1986.   The election marked the rebirth in Manitoba of the LiberalParty, which had only one seat in the last legislature.   Its leader, Winnipeg schoolteacher Sharon Carstairs, became theonly woman leader of an official opposition party in Canada andcould be the first woman premier if the Conservatives cannot governthe province without a majority.   If Progressive Conserverative leader Gary Filmon's governmentfails to win the support of either Liberals or New Democrats oncrucial votes, he could be forced into another election.   Filmon ruled out policy trade-offs to win such backing. ``I'mnot talking about any deals,'' he said Wednesday.   Ms. Carstairs said ``I don't believe in coalitions'' andexpressed no interest in forming one with the New Democrats inwhich she might be premier.   Five of Canada's 10 provincial governments now are led by theConservatives and four by the Liberals. British Columbia isgoverned by the Social Credit Party.</TEXT></DOC>
