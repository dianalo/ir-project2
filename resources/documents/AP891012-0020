Manuel Antonio Noriega changedthe rules of the barracks when he snuffed out the second militaryattempt to topple him in 18 months. Now it's kill or be killed.   ``I think the law of the jungle is now the rule within themilitary,'' opposition leader Ricardo Arias Calderon said in aninterview.   When rebellious officers tried to overthrow Noriega in March1988, the coup attempt was played by the old rules of DefenseForces power struggles. It was bloodless.   But the Oct. 3 barracks uprising, which showed Noriega's hold onpower was more precarious than previously thought, may have endedwith the summary execution of several mutineers. Top members of hisgeneral staff were arrested, and their whereabouts or condition isunknown.   ``In military life, he who takes up arms in rebellion has hisanswer in arms, too,'' Col. Arnulfo Castrejon, a member of thegeneral staff, said Wednesday.   Noriega is accused of personally shooting the coup leader, Maj.Moises Giroldi, who was credited with putting down the March 1988revolt.   The Defense Forces say Giroldi was killed by an artillery blast.However, the family said three bullet wounds were found in his body.   At least seven other officers and two sergeants also died,possibly after surrendering.   Capt. Leon Tejada was shot once in the right temple, his mothersaid.   Another officer, Capt. Nicasio Lorenzo, died in custody severaldays after the uprising. The Defense Forces has offered noexplanation for what the coroner called ``death by asphyxiation.''   Neither the whereabouts or condition of 36 other rebel soldierson the Defense Forces list of detainees is known.   ``I am afraid other prisoners are dead,'' Roman Catholic Rev.Francisco Guardia said as he prepared to say a funeral Mass forLorenzo earlier this week.   President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela on Tuesday accusedthe Defense Forces of murder and called for Latin America to takestrong action against Noriega.   The rebels stopped short of killing Noriega when he was ahostage; U.S. officials say the rebels wouldn't even agree to turnNoriega over to the United States for prosecution on drug charges.Instead, Giroldi and his men surrendered.   The Oct. 3 rebels hesitated and died for it. Now that Noriegahas rewritten the rules, few expect to see the mistake repeated.   ``I think he's bringing upon himself greater opposition and moreviolent opposition,'' Arias Calderon said. ``Noriega is much weakerbecause he has brought violence and death into the center of hispower.''   Panama has lived with military strongmen for 21 years but eventhe 1968 coup in which the late Gen. Omar Torrijos took power wasbloodless. The country had not experienced the kind ofpolitical-military violence that has traumatized neighbors such asColombia or El Salvador.   Until now.   Noriega, a Torrijos protege without the Torrijos charisma, hasbecome increasingly volatile since his February 1988 indictment inthe United States on drug-trafficking charges. Noriega denies guilt.   Once admired for the sheer force of his personality, the generalnow commands through fear.   ``He is a beast,'' one coup participant said after reaching theUnited States.   ``He has established a new rule of the game,'' said AriasCalderon. ``Kill or be killed.''   The Oct. 3 uprising not only exposed deep discontent at thehighest levels of the 15,000-person Defense Forces, its bloodyending also left Noriega isolated.   Three members of Noriega's general staff, including the head ofmilitary intelligence, were among those arrested after the mutiny.Key units, such as the one responsible for security at DefenseForces headquarters, were involved.   Three colonels, two majors, three captains and nineteenlieutenants are on the Defense Forces list of detainees and anothercaptain and 41 other people fled to the United States after thecoup failed.   The revolt has sparked the largest shuffling of commanders inDefense Forces history. The internal purges leave Noriega with anofficer corps stripped of many of its most professional leaders,sources say.   The Defense Forces denies Noriega personally killed anymutineers. They say all the victims died during the fighting.   At the same time, some clear, even clumsy, messages are beingsent.   Several days after the uprising, the pro-Noriega newspaperCritica ran a story about a 1987 coup attempt in distant SierraLeone on its front page under a thick red headline.   ``Six People Executed For a Coup Attempt,'' it said.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Candice Hughes has covered Mexico and CentralAmerica for The Associated Press since 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
