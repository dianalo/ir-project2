Under the terms of a leveraged buyout begun by Joy, Pullman-Peabody will also be able sell its 4.2% stake in Joy for $26.3 million, or a profit of $8.3 million.    As part of the agreement, Pullman-Peabody must refrain for at least two years from buying any Joy common shares without Joy's consent.    Joy, a Pittsburgh-based maker of oil-field and mining equipment, said the $750,000 payment was for Pullman-Peabody's expenses in connection with the tender offer and terminated litigation. Joy had filed suit against Pullman-Peabody challenging the unsolicited tender offer.    As previously reported, Joy's management thwarted Pullman-Peabody's sweetened bid of $34 a share by arranging to take the company private through a leveraged buyout at $35 a share, or about $620 million. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Wednesday, Joy closed at $34.75, unchanged.    In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired in a transaction financed largely through borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or the sale of its assets.    The buyout is being organized by Adler andamp; Shaykin, a New York investment firm that proposes to acquire as much as 94.3% of the oil-field and mining equipment maker's 17.7 million shares outstanding through a new company, Joy Acquisition Corp.    Pullman-Peabody, a maker of material-handling and food-service equipment, said it will tender the 750,000 Joy shares it acquired for $18 million before beginning its takeover bid and will return to holders any Joy shares tendered during its offer.    Pullman-Peabody said it also agreed not to take any action against Joy's buyout plan and to release all claims between Joy and Pullman-Peabody. </TEXT></DOC>
