<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-64-0526 </DOCNO><TEXT>A distributed data acquisition system that uses various computer hardwareand software is being developed to support magnetic fusion experimentsat Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory (LLNL). The experimental sequenceof operations is controlled by a supervisory program, which coordinatessoftware running on Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX computers,Hewlett-Packard (HP) UNIX-based workstations, and HP BASIC desktop computers.An interprocess communication system (IPCS) allows programs to communicatewith one another in a standard manner regardless of program locationin the network or of operating system and hardware differences. We discussthe design and implementation of this data acquisition system with particularemphasis on the coordination model and the IPCS. 5 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
