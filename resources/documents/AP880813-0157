GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   People filled the streets of Burma'scapital Saturday to celebrate the resignation of the president onedissident called ``Burma's Hitler,'' but skirmishes continuedoutside Rangoon, diplomats and travelers said.   Western diplomats in Rangoon said the capital was quiet aftermassive protests and violence claimed at least 95 lives during the17-day rule of hard-line leader Sein Lwin, who resigned Friday.   But they cited reports of minor skirmishes in the eastern suburbof Okkalapa and unconfirmed reports of looting and shooting in theworking-class area, where some of the fiercest fighting raged lastweek.   Food and medicine were scarce and barely any transportation wasavailable into the capital from the countryside, said thediplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Shops reopened and citizens filled the streets to cheer theresignation of the president they described as the ``Butcher ofStudents,'' according to Brett B. Lambert, an American studentreturning from Rangoon.   ``People are smiling and happy,'' Lambert said.   News reports said students in the capital continued passing outleflets urging protests to win democracy.   Lambert said posters on walls of the capital showed Sein Lwinwith blood dripping from his mouth, a skull and crossbones aroundhis face, and ``massacre'' written beneath.   ``Burma's Hitler was brought down by the might of all thepeople,'' Japan's Kyodo News Agency quoted one Burmese as saying.   Peter Swan, an Australian film maker returning from Rangoon,said he visited the Rangoon General Hospital and saw more than 300people wounded from the demonstrations last week.   Diplomats said hundreds may have died in the fighting, andunconfirmed reports said up to 1,000 were killed.   Rangoon, a city of 3.5 million, had been under a daytime curfewsince Tuesday.   The diplomats said prices were soaring, food was running low andhospitals, which normally function at threadbare levels, werereported seriously short of blood, bandages and other vital medicalsupplies.   Sein Lwin stepped down after reports that Burmese soldiers wereturning against the government and allowing people to march throughsome towns in support of democracy and economic reforms.   Burma's official Rangoon Radio, which announced the resignation,gave no reason and did not say who Sein Lwin's successor would be.   ``We're in a kind of wait-and-see mode. The Burmese are veryrelieved that Sein Lwin stepped down but basically skeptical aboutwhat it all means,'' one diplomat said. ``Is this cosmetic or is ita real concession to the demonstrators?''   Lambert said that before Friday's announcement, large numbers oftroops moved through Rangoon in armored personnel carriers.Protesters torched buildings, street lights, houses and policestations in the city, which was under martial law.   After the announcement, soldiers stationed around Lambert'shotel withdrew. But Lambert said a number of Burmese told him ``itwas not over yet'' and that much depended on who would be the nextpresident.   Josef Silverstein, a leading American expert on Burma, said in atelephone interview that a likely candidate for president was KyawHtin, a relatively liberal military officer who received sometraining in the United States. He has been the No. 3 man in thegovernment and party.   Burma's economic recovery is expected to be slow and difficult.Once one of Asia's wealthiest nations, Burma, is now among theworld's poorest countries with per capital income less than $200 ayear.   Almost 80 percent of the loans Burma received in 1986 came fromJapan, but Tokyo's aid has been declining.   Japan on Saturday called for swift economic reforms in Burma andurged the country to restore order. The Japanese foreign ministrysaid economic depression was the major cause of the protests inBurma.   Minoru Kiryu of the Asian Economy Research Center in Tokyo saidthat with recent aid cuts Japan has been putting pressure onBurmese leaders to carry out economic and political reforms.   The economic problems were brought on by the isolationistpolicies of Ne Win, who ruled Burma for 26 years. He resigned lastmonth, citing student unrest in March and June. Sein Lwin waselected his successor July 26.   Almost immediately, students, monks, workers and others filledthe streets of Rangoon demanding the new president's ouster. Theyblamed the former general for brutally crushing the March and Junestudent unrest and cited his bloody suppression of RangoonUniversity riots after the 1962 coup.   The protests spread to two dozen other cities and on Tuesday,soldiers began firing into mobs of demonstrators.   Reports from Burma indicated security forces in at least twotowns sided with the protesters, and a guerrilla leader fightingthe government called for a coordinated nationwide offensive.</TEXT></DOC>
