(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The key is in the translationandM;Data sharing between Macs and IBM PCs has come a long way in the past fewyears.andP;  The market now offers a half-dozen network solutions for people whoneed constant links between their machines.andP;  Many floppy disk drive productsare available, too, making it easy to feed &quot;foreign&quot; disks into Macs and PCs.andO;For most of us, though, the simplest and least expensive solution to Mac-PCconnectivity remains direct-connect cables and fule transfer/translationsoftware.andP;  In this review, we look at xFer, a new direct-connect product, andreport on upgrades to three products: PC QuickShare 2.0, LapLink Mac 2.0 andMacLink Plus 3.0.andM;xFer.andP;  Like LapLink Mac and MacLink Plus, xFer is a direct-connect productthat can send files locally between Macs and PCs (serial port to serial port)at up to 57,600 bps or over modems at up to 9,600 bps.andP;  It consists ofsoftware for both machines, and an optional cable with an eight-pin Macintoshend and both nine-pin and 25-pin PC connectors.andP;  Once the program is bootedon both machines, it's completely controlled from the Macintosh through afairly good interface.andM;xFer brings to the market a capability that competing products currentlycan't match: It can transfer entire folders or directories between PCs andMacs with a single command.andP;  The procedure is much easier than LapLink'sGroup and Wildcard options for moving multiple files, and much more complete,since it allows you the option of including not only the top level of filesin the folder but also any subfolders and their contents.andM;If you transfer a complete folder from a Mac to a PC using xFer's defaultsettings, you'll be interrupted after each file and asked to pick a newDOS-compatible name (DOS limits file and directory names to eight characterswith a three-character extension).andP;  For unimpeded transfer, you can specifythat Mac file names simply be truncated, that special characters be changedto an underline and that names that would become duplicate get a numberappended to them.andM;Given its ability to copy entire folders and directories at once, it's notsurprising that xFer is being marketed not only as a data-sharing product butalso as a backup program.andP;  The program's Backup command adds two hidden filesto your target directory on the PC to keep track of what you've backed up andwhen.andP;  Then, if you do an incremental backup of the folder later, it willcopy only those files that have changed or been added since the last backup.andM;Options for PC file maintenance let you delete files and folders from your PCremotely through a pleasant point-and-click interface.andP;  This may be one ofthe most valuable features of the program for those working in the mixedoffice.andP;  We were able to clean up the hard disk on an IBM PC AT and removesome stubborn hidden files without a tedious session of typing.andM;Three considerable drawbacks detract from Messenger Software's promisingpackage.andP;  First, xFer won't allow you to select more than one folder forbackup or transfer, which makes backing up your entire Mac hard disk atedious folder-by-folder procedure.andP;  While you could rearrange your hard diskto nest all you work folders within a single backup folder, this would meanone more level to open up every time you work.andP;  xFer should allow you toselect several folders at once.andM;The second drawback is more serious: xFer won't work in the background underMultiFinder.andP;  While it will let you switch to another application, allfile-transfer activity will be suspended until you return to xFer, making itimpossible for you to transfer large files or back up routinely while youcontinue to work.andM;If you're still tempted to use xFer for its backup features, the finaldrawback you should be aware of is that file transfer over serial cables isslow.andP;  Actual throughput of any serial product falls far short of thetheoretical potential of 57,600 bps.andP;  xFer took more than five minutes totransfer a 469-Kbyte folder (about 12,300 bps); even a 179 Kbyte file took aminute and 49 seconds to move from the Mac to the PC (about 13,100 bps).andP;  Thesame file took only 19 seconds to back up to a Mac floppy.andP;  The gap betweenpotential and actual speed for xFer is fairly typical, but it is more of aproblem when doing backups.andM;When it comes to file translation, xFer offers very little indeed.andP;  Unlessyou're using WordPerfect or Microsoft Word on both the PC and the Mac, orother applications that can read common formats, like Lotus 1-2-3 and Excelor FoxBASE+/Mac and dBASE III, you'll need to translate your files after youtransfer them, but xFer offers almost no translation capabilities.andP;  To andfrom the Mac, xFer supports only the transfer of text files.andP;  Formatted wordprocessing, graphics, database or spreadsheet files can be transferred bytefor byte, but if any translation is needed, you're completely on your own.andM;Messenger Software plans to add more translation capabilities in Version 1.1of xFer, but they will have a do-it-yourself flavor, consisting primarily ofthe ability to specify complex search-and-replace sequences in hex or ASCII.andM;For many people, the lack of any viable translation capability may make xFerunusable.andP;  While its file-transfer capabilities are superior to anythingcurrently on the market, real data sharing consists of moving and translatingfiles.andP;  You may well have to buy another program to get the translationfeatures that xFer lacks.andM;MacLink Plus.andP;  The longtime king of translation programs (see MacWEEK, May24, 1988) has been upgraded recently in the area where it was alreadystrongest: file format translation.andP;  In Version 3.0, DataViz has added newfilters for WordPerfect 5.0, XyWrite III, OfficeWriter and WPS-Plus/VMS onthe PC side, and a very useful Print Capture option.andP;  Print Capture cantranslate PC output designed for an Epson or IBM Graphics printer intoMacWrite, Word or WordPerfect Mac format.andP;  As such, it acts as a generictranslator for any PC word processor not directly supported by MacLink'sfilters.andP;  DataViz adds new filters to MacLink Plus as often as every fewmonths, and its offerings are quickly becoming a standard in the Mac world.andM;Two other welcome improvements to MacLink are the inclusion of both 5.25-inchand 3.5-inch disks for its DOS software, and the new ability to transfergroups of files.andP;  While less capable than xFer's folder-and-subfoldertransfers, MacLink lets you select multiple files in the same folder to moveat once.andP;  Be aware, though, that all the files you select must be of the sametype unless you want to make a simple binary transfer without translation.andM;On the down side, MacLink does not work in the background under MultiFinder.andO;In fact, MacLink won't even switch to another application.andP;  You're locked inuntil your transfer is finished.andP;  This is definitely a drawback in a programthat nonetheless offers the most complete range of translation optionsavailable.andM;LapLink Mac.andP;  Jumping on the translation bandwagon, LapLink Mac 2.0 nowadvertises that it offers translators for several IBM PC and Mac wordprocessors.andP;  This claim turns out to be only half true.andP;  LapLink actuallyoffers translation between several PC word processors.andP;  You then translatethe PC file to a Mac format using the automatic translation features ofMicrosoft Word or WordPerfect.andM;If, for example, you used XyWrite III on a PC and wanted to move the file toMacWrite, you'd use LapLink's translators to move from XyWrite to DOS Word.andO;Then you'd need Word for the Mac to read in the file, and save it again inMacWrite format.andP;  If you have WordPerfect or Word, this arrangement allowsfor many types of translations, but otherwise LapLink is fairly limited.andM;This program is the best in handling background transfers under MultiFinder,and it includes the best direct-connect cable (with eight- and nine-pin Macends, and nine- and 25-pin PC ends).andP;  But we can recommend it only to peoplewho are very comfortable with the DOS interface.andP;  Everything is controlledfrom the PC side, and even if you're familiar with DOS you'll find its menustructure confusing.andM;PC QuickShare.andP;  PC QuickShare 2.0 should be thought of not so much as atransfer product but as something that can turn a spare PC into an extra Machard disk drive (see MacWEEK Feb. 2, 1988).andP;  As such, it's much faster thanthe serial port products (its top theoretical speed is 1.4 Mbps rather than57,600 bps), but requires the added nuisance and expense of installing a SCSIboard in your PC.andP;  The latest version adds several nice features that make agood product even better.andM;The most important feature of Version 2.0 is its ability to partition the PChard disk into several Mac-compatible volumes.andP;  Where the original softwaredesignated part of your PC's drive as a single Mac volume, you can now createup to eight on a single hard disk or on any other storage device available tothe PC.andP;  This means, for instance, that you could install PC QuickShare'sSCSI board in a networked PC and then set up as many as eight Mac &quot;drives&quot;anywhere on the network.andP;  These Mac volumes show up on your Mac desktop justlike local SCSI drives.andM;While this expanded drive access is the main improvement to QuickShare,several options for managing files on both PCs and Macs have also been added.andO;While these new options don't add greatly to the functionality of PCQuickShare, they do add ease of use by letting you easily sort and viewdirectories and change drives.andM;Translation options with PC QuickShare remain the same.andP;  Compatible's twoprograms, AnyText and AnyGraph, take Epson printer output from wordprocessors or graphics programs and translate it into MacWrite or MacPaintformat, respectively.andP;  Keep in mind that while this offers near-universaltranslation for words and bit maps, it is a one-way transfer.andP;  These programsoffer no way to move from the Mac to the PC.andM;If you're currently a QuickShare 1.0 user, you should be aware that someQuickShare PC SCSI boards may have to be upgraded in order to run the newsoftware effectively.andM;Conclusions.andP;  All of these products make it easier to share data between PCsand Macs.andP;  If you're staying in one place and transferring lots of largefiles frequently, use PC QuickShare.andP;  It's faster than AppleTalk forconnecting a single PC and a Mac.andP;  If you're moving data among severaldifferent PCs and Macs, go with the flexibility of a serial cable that can beeasily moved from machine to machine.andP;  LapLink's cable is best, but MacLink'stranslators still stand above the rest.andP;  If you simply must have backgroundprocessing, choose LapLink and put up with its DOS interface.andM;Unfortunately, it's difficult to find a niche for the new xFer.andP;  While it's aquality product, the things it does well are things most people don't need todo very often, and it's almost wholly lacking in translation capability.andO;While no one of these products excels in all areas, the typical needs of themixed Mac and PC office for transferring and translating files are better metby MacLink, LapLink or PC QuickShare.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
