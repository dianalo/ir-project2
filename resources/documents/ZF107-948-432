 Rather, itwas the gut-wrenching journey shared by nearly everyone who had a stake inthe personal computer industry as a user, vendor, or observer.andP;  And as befitsa roller coaster ride, the year just ended left the bulk of the passengersslightly dazed, generally unharmed, and eager for another trip.andM;While the business press rewarmed those &quot;Analysts Fear Recession Looms inComputer Industry&quot; stores, the bulk of PC users in large and small businessesplunged ahead with life as usual.andP;  They've learned that uncertainty andconstant change-- &quot;hyperchange,&quot; if you're one for buzzwords--are the norm,and if you wait for the industry to settle down before deciding which PC andwhich word processor to buy, your business quickly becomes a technologicallaggard.andM;Consider the changes and uncertainties of 1989:andM;* OS/2's hazy outlook.andP;  Yes, it's going to win out--probably certainly, or isit certainly probably?--but that's still a couple of years off.andP;  Best guessas to when OS/2 gets real?andP;  1992 or 1993.andP;  But it's important for softwarevendors to have their apps ready in 1990 if OS/2 is to succeed in 1992.andO;Here's the timetable: A critical mass of OS/2 apps arrives in 1990.andO;Brand-specifying users evaluate them in 1991--and requisition them fordelivery and installation on end users' PCs in 1992.andM;* Window's bright outlook.andP;  When the new version of Microsoft Windows ships(late, as usual), it will perform OS/2-like trikcs with memory and multipleapplications, and it may approach the Mac in ease-of-use.andP;  Which begs thequestion: If Windows 3.0 is so good, what do I need OS/2 for?andP;  (See &quot;1989:The Year in Operating Systems&quot; in this issue.)andM;* Vaporware.andP;  Virtually every major piece of software continues to shipbehind schedule.andP;  To the industry truism that software lags behind hardware,you can add this corollary: applications software lags further still,crippled by late or incomplete delivery of OS/2 and Windows environments anddeveloper toolkits.andP;  DOS apps lag because of the difficulty of cramming morefunctionality into the increasingly limited 640K workspace.andM;* Hard times of LATE.andP;  Most of the software industry's top five were batteredby late deliveries, bugs, fiscal setbacks, corporate head-rolling, and dimmedproduct appeal: Lotus, Ashton-Tate, and--to a lesser extent--Borland andMicrosoft.andP;  Wags suggest that a merger of Lotus and Ashton-Tate would producethe stock ticker symbol LATE.andM;* Micro Channel and EISA uncertainty.andP;  When they cut through the hot air,users now realize that Micro Channel and EISA machines hold little if anyperformance advantage over classic-bus PCs, at least for now, with the likelyexception of future file-server applications.andP;  (See &quot;1989: The Wait-and-SeeYear of PCs.&quot;)andM;* 386s slowly gain momentum.andP;  286-based PCs account for more than half of allcomputer sales, essentially defying the advice of just about everyforward-looking voice in the industry that says 286s are brain-dead andthere's no defensible reason to buy anything less than a 386SX.andP;  386s mayfinally gain significnat market-share momentum in 1990 as savvy corporationsrealize that the cost of a 386 CPU over a 286 is truly incremental.andP;  Figureon 386 PCs taking a third of all sales in 1990, with 8088/86 PCs down toabout 10 percent.andM;* Who's aligned with whom?andP;  Perhaps most uncertain of all was thecan't-tell-the-players-without-a-scorecard rash of alliances, couplings, anduncouplings.andP;  It's enough to suggest the need for a Silicon Valley remake ofBob and Carol and Ted and Alice.andP;  The oddest couple was Microsoft and Apple,who at year's end stopped slinging mud and look-and-feel lawsuit long enoughto turn on Adobe and its proprietary font scheme after Adobe (in the opinionof Apple/Microsoft) got too big for its britches.andP;  In 1989 politics made forstrange bedfellows.andP;  In 1990 bedfellows will make for strange politics.andM;THE YEAR OF THE LAND--FINALLYandM;If you were looking for good news in 1989, you found plenty of it in theconnectivity marketplace.andP;  LAN boosters grew tired of proclaiming &quot;This willbe the year of the LAN&quot; for the umpteenth year, went off to sulk, and watchedfrom the sidelines as connected environments began to reach criticalmass--finally.andP;  Three-quarters of PC Magazine readers say their companies arenow using LANs, according to a PC MagNet survey.andP;  LAN operating systems havebecome more powerful and reliable, and they're being tended to byincreasingly knowledgeable LAN gurus.andP;  Other factors: the decreasing price ofnetwork cards and the increasing capabilities of twisted-pair wiring.andP;  Ifyou're installing a LAN today, odds are you'll be using twisted-pair(essentially high-class phone wire, already in the walls of most recentbuildings).andP;  If you see coaxial cable going into an office today, it's likelythat someone ordered cable TV, not LAN cabling.andM;Novell, which has more than half the LAN market now, shipped its powerfulNetWare 386 in September with a truly bigtime price ($8,000 plus), and 3Comfollowed suit a few weeks later with an upgraded version of its OS/2 LANManager (3+ Open Lan Manager, Version 1.1), which--with a specially tuned3Com file server--came within about 5 percent of matching Novell'sperformance.andP;  Traditionally, LAN Manager in every flavor has been a poorsecond to NetWare in performance.andM;If LANs are to replace minicomputers, users need grown-up software and fileservers.andP;  1989 saw the introduction of gigabyte file-storage capacity and thegrowth of the database server.andP;  In a network with a database server, theserver front end on the PC passes a short, simple SQL query to a databaseengine sitting on a file server, and the file server passes back theanswer--thus saving the overhead of sending entire database files.andP;  Thespecialized-server concept applies to communications servers (directing modemand fax pools, inter-LAN communications, and mainframe links), printerservers, and even applications servers.andP;  Sybase emerged as the brightestlight of the database-server companies, forming alliances with Microsoft,Ashton-Tate, Lotus, Sun, and Digital.andM;Workgroup-productivity and mail software continues to get better--Higgins,Right Hand Man, Da Vinci eMail, and cc:Mail, for instance--but you're stillhardpressed to find an electronic group calendar that's as capable andflexible as a good secretary.andP;  With its Office Vision announcement, IBMoffered its wide-ranging vision of the connected workgroup environment of theearly 1990s.andP;  IBM's principal SAA (Systems Application Architecture) offeringto date, Office Vision will be powerful, graphical, and, of course, completewith ties to IBM mainframes and minis.andP;  On PCs, it will require the IBM-onlyExtended Edition version of the Presentation Manager.andM;While 386s and soon 486s provide blazing speed, your next file server may bea dedicated machine that isn't quite a PC.andP;  Most promising are the NetFramefile servers based on multiple 386s with a mainframe-lie architecture and aclaimed throughput 5 to 15 times that of a fast 386.andM;ISDN SPELLS OPPORTUNITYandM;ISDN, the acronym people love to hate (Integrated Services Digital Network or&quot;I Still Don't Need&quot;--take your pick), became real for PCs in 1989, unnoticedexcept by its well-financed backers.andP;  ISDN turns an ordinary telephone linein an office or home into two 64-kilobit-per-second voice or data lines and athird, slower control line, allowing nearly-LAN-speed data transfers acrosstown and eventually across the country.andP;  NCR delivered a PC ISDN adapter withOS/2 PM controlling software, and ATandamp;T rolled adapters out to VARs.andP;  Severalsmaller companies see ISDN as the nexxt golden path to riches, perhapsjustifying the acronym's third definition: &quot;I Smell Dollars Now.&quot;andM;If there's one thing to remember about the LAN market in 1990, it's this: Forall the heat generated by the NetWare 386 vs.andP;  3+ Open LAN Manager contest,if you're a Novell shop now, you're likely to remain that way and upgradeeventually to NetWare 386.andP;  If you're a 3 + share user now, you're likely tostay within the 3Com family when you upgrade.andP;  (If you live with IBM or DECnow, they too have capable solutions designed to keep you in the fold.)andO;Switching LAN operating systems involves far more grief than trading yourdepartment-standard Deskpros in for Micro Channel PCs.andP;  So, much of thebattle is for departments not yet connected, or for offices starting fromscratch.andM;EASE OF USEandM;For every user who wants more power, there's another who'd rather see PCsthat are easier to use.andP;  Microsoft chairman Bill Gates envisionsCD-ROM-equipped PCs in the early 1990s that provide full-motion, interactiveon-screen video and audio training.andP;  In the shorter term, the prognosis isfor Band-Aid solutions: still more DOS shells and menuing systems to insulateless-skilled users from DOS's quirks, slightly better context-sensitive helpin programs, and a brisk market in training tapes and books.andP;  MicrosoftWindows 3.0, when it ships early this year, may turn out to be the best ofthe DOS insulators, and Microsoft would dearly love to see future PCs shippedwith DOS and Windows on every machine.andM;Windows on every DOS machine would also mean having the same interface on PCsrunning DOS and the Presentation Manager, as well as on Unix workstations,where the PM-like OSF/Motif has gained the upper hand among graphicalinterfaces.andP;  If you listen to the optimists, the new Windows/PM interfacewill be as easy to use as the Mac.andP;  We'll see.andP;  Or as Apple would say, &quot;We'llsee you in court.&quot;andM;Tandy continues to push hard with DeskMate, a graphical interface for all PCs(including lower-powered systems that Windows would overwhelm).andP;  Tandylaunched DeskMate in part because it got burned by Microsoft when the Windowsrevolution didn't start on schedule (discombobulating plans that had Tandybuilding Windows-specific PCs).andP;  Over the summer, Tandy got Lotus andSymantec to develop DeskMate versions of Lotus 1-2-3 and Qandamp;A Write.andO;Nonetheless, earlier DeskMate champions (Software Publishing and Intuit, forexample) have been dragging their heels on DeskMate-compatible upgrades.andM;SPEED DEMONSandM;The excitement of the first 286 and 386 PCs doesn't seem to apply today, asusers find the progress from 20 MHz to 25 MHz to 33 MHz to 486-25 (yawn) to486-33 to 586 part of a logical and expected progression.andP;  Users also knowthat what makes a PC fast may be more than a blazing CPU.andP;  It might be fastESDI or SCSI hard disks and disk-caching controllers on file servers (see&quot;Get Smart: High-Performance Caching Disk Controllers&quot; in this issue), mathcoprocessors on CAD workstations, graphics coprocessors (likely based onTexas Instruments' 34010 chip) for desktop publishing, Windows andPresentation Manager workstations, and in-the-PC printer controller boardsfor complex desktop publishing pages.andM;In 1990 powerful 386 and 386SX portables with docking stations and externalmonitors will begin to replace desktop PCs in some offices; 386SX PCs willchoke the high end of the 286 market as price differences drop to under $200;and by year's end the 486 will become a price competitor to high-end 386s.andO;While the 486 chip costs more, it includes a built-in match chip and memorycache.andP;  Lastly, the rash of truly lightweight (under 7.5 pounds) 8088/86portables will be joined by a handful of go-anywhere 286 and 386SX machines.andM;BETTER VIDEOandM;Of all benefits of the PS/2, the clearest has been the improved resolutionoffered by the 640 by 480 VGA video standard and the nonstandard 800 by 600Super VGA extension.andP;  Subjectively, Super VGA looks about twice as good asVGA; the improvement is much more noticeable than VGA's improvement over EGA.andO;Too bad the Super VGA standards committee--VESA, spearheaded by NEC--haslittle to show for all its meetings and attempts to define one universal 800by 600 interface that all software could use.andM;To display 800 by 600 pixels, you need a multiscanning monitor or amultifrequency monitor.andP;  Multifrequency monitors (like the NEC MultiSync 2A)are cheaper, and for all the hubbub surrounding multiscanning monitors, itturns out that today's multiscanner typically falls just short of theelectronic headroom needed to run tomorrow's video standard, so you need anew monitor anyway when you get a new video card.andP;  You can now order SuperVGA--ready multifrequency monitors with most PC compatibles.andP;  Super VGA costsabout $100 to $200 more than VGA--and it's worth the extra cost.andP;  The twomain holdouts on the Super VGA revolution are the industry's 800-poundgorillas, IBM and Compaq, which want to move you up one notch further onresolution and two notches on price.andM;IBM's other PS/2 video standard, 8514, with 1,024 by 768 interlacedresolution, has been slower to take off.andP;  In fact, it's unlikely that 8514will ever get off the ground.andP;  Wy?andP;  IBM chose an inferior standard.andO;Interlacing means the monitor displays the even-numbered lines, then theodd-numbered lines, taking two sweeps to produce a single frame.andP;  It'scheaper than noninterlaced video, but the flicker will drive you crazy.andO;Don't believe anyone who says otherwise unless you've spent a day in front ofan interlaced monitor.andP;  Most users will decide that 8514 isn't worth theheadaches.andP;  Better bets are noninterlaced Texas Instruments 34010-based 1,024by 768 boards.andP;  Compaq and Dell use the same Renaissance-designed board; NEChas a similar unit called the Graphics Engine.andP;  You can buy one of these forabout the same price IBM gets for its board.andM;If you're buying PCs in 1990 to run Windows or the Presentation Manager, lookat the emerging group of 16-inch monitors, which allow for more-readablemultiple-window sessions than standard 13-and 14-inch monitors.andM;AFFORDABLE LASERSandM;Hewlett-Packard has continued its mastery of the laser printer market withthe HP LaserJet Series IIP, a $1,500, 4-page-per-minute unit with a streetprice quickly approaching $1,000.andP;  Okidata and Toshiba chimed in with similarunits offering slightly more features for slightly more money.andP;  And IBMproduced what may be the best LaserJet Series II compatible yet; the $2,695IBM LaserPrinter provides more speed and more fonts for the same price as theLaserJet II.andM;The laser printer you really want may well ship early in 1990: anext-generation LaserJet with infinitely scalable fonts but without thefont-rotation/vector-clipping bells and whistles that make PostScriptprinters cost $2,000 more than LaserJet compatibles.andP;  HP and others arelikely to make these available for no more than $500 to $1000 over the priceof their current LaserJet-compatible printers.andP;  Scalable-font printers willdrive demand for WYSIWIG (what you see is what you get) software, especiallyword processos.andP;  Unfortunately, true multifont displays won't be here untillate 1990 or later.andM;SOFTWARE JUGGERNAUTandM;As the industry matures and more good products appear, you could argue, it'sunlikely that we'll ever again see the market dominance of a Lotus 1-2-3 orAshton-Tate's dBASE.andP;  Except for one thing: the WordPerfect juggernaut.andP;  Intwo years, WordPerfect has climbed from about 25 or 30 percent market shareand a slight lead over Microsoft Word to a 60-plus percent market share.andP;  Andit's not from technical superiorty.andP;  Half a dozen word processors provideroughly all the features of WordPerfect, and it's a coin toss whetherWordPerfect or Word is better.andP;  So why does WordPerfect have the marketshare?andP;  The most likely reason: unlimited toll-free support.andP;  WordPerfectCorp. plows a huge chunk of its revenues back in no-questions-asked,all-questions-answered technical help.andP;  Others offer free support; some offertoll-free support.andP;  But nobody does it with the style and class of the peoplein the WordPerfect organization.andM;A quick survey of the other software categories:andM;* In graphics, there's a sense that no PC products is really first-ratecompared with Mac offerings like Aldus Persuasion and Microsoft's PowerPoint.andO;The only new graphics products that will matter will run under Windows or thePresentation Manager.andP;  Software Publishing Corp. is taking a big risk byporting Harvard Graphics from DOS to the Presentation Manager before doingWindows.andP;  Given PM's slow takeoff, SPC may have the order backward.andM;* If every word written about personal information managers (PIMs) in 1988translated into a sale in 1989, this would be a robust market.andP;  But wordshave not become deeds.andP;  The word PIM is a broad umbrella covering three dozenprograms that handle outlining; notetaking, text databases, and textretrieval; hypermedia; and tracking, calendaring, and time management.andO;GrandView, IZE, and PackRat are all PIMs, but they're far frominterchangeable.andP;  Perhaps the most ballyehooed, Lotus's Agenda, failed tocatch on; its incredible complexity overshadowed its incredible ability.andP;  Onehope for some of the fading PIMs: put them on a LAN and label them groupware.andO;One new PIM to watch: IBM Current, which will be great even before the LANversion ships.andM;* In desktop publishing, while PageMaker and Ventura Publisher slug it out atthe high end, the low end has returned to life.andP;  Now the best of theunder-$250 programs won't embarass you (unless you use a dot matrix printer):Logitech's Finesse, DRI's GEM Publisher, and PinPoint Publishing's ExpressPublisher.andP;  Next step for high-end products: better handling of colorartwork, enabling users to design any publication on a PC.andM;* Forms processing has emerged as a secondary market, led by Delrina'sPerForm, a Technical Excellence finalist, and Indigo Software's JetForm.andP;  Thefuture of the forms market may be not as standalone products but asintelligent extensions to databases, word processors, and desktop publishingprograms.andM;BEST OF 1989andM;On the following pages, PC Magazine's editors and frequent contributors havehighlighted 30 of the year's best products.andP;  How were they selected?andP;  Mostqualified for consideration by virtue of winning Editor's Choice statusearlier in the year; we also selected from among promising new products thathaven't yet received PC Magazine reviews.andP;
