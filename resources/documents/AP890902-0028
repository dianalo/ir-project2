It is adangerous form of intimidation that makes a mockery of fraternallove and we're dedicated to eradicating it in the fraternitysystem,'' said Jonathan Brant, executive director of the NationalInterfraternity Conference.   Brant said his group defines hazing as any action or situationintended to produce mental or physical harassment, embarrassment orridicule.   The National Interfraternity Conference, based in Indianapolis,represents 59 major fraternities with 5,155 chapters and more than400,000 student members in the United States and Canada.   Brant said the conference had adopted an anti-hazing resolutionmore than 30 years ago and that most fraternities have had rulesagainst hazing for the past two decades.   ``We are painfully aware that in the past 10 years, more than 40students have died and hundreds have been seriously injured bystudent organizations in what have been referred to as`hazing-related incidents,''' Brant said.   The anti-hazing campaign will involve distribution of printedmaterials on campuses, organizing discussion groups at fraternitychapters and publishing articles in alumni magazines, he said.   Fraternity pledging evolved in the late 19th century and wasmeant to be a rite of passage for new recruits before theirinitiation as full members.</TEXT><NOTE>Baker, Shevardnadze Meeting in Wyoming Set</NOTE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Secretary of State James A.

Barry said in a letter to Thornburgh on Friday that disclosuresconcerning the Justice Department's investigation into his linkswith convicted drug dealer Charles Lewis have damaged his ability togovern.

Stephens declined to comment on whether Lewis has implicatedBarry, but said he wants the Justice Department to investigatewhether stories about Lewis' cooperation originated with lawenforcement officials.   Local television stations and newspapers have reported that Lewistold investigators he smoked crack with Barry in Lewis' hotel roomin December and that federal investigators have said they believethey have enough evidence to seek an indictment of Barry on perjuryand obstruction of justice charges.   For the past several years, Barry has been dogged by rumors thathe uses drugs. On Thursday, he said again that he never saw or useddrugs during at least six visits to Lewis' room.</TEXT></DOC>
