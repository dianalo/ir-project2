Revenue rose 8.7% to $455.1 million from $418.7 million.    Joseph L. Dionne, president and chief executive officer, said New York-based McGraw-Hill's book company had disappointing sales in elementary, high school and training markets, while soft national and local time sales were a problem for its broadcasting company.    But he added that McGraw-Hill is &quot;encouraged by prospects&quot; for the fourth quarter, with the publications company showing strength. &quot;All signs point to finishing 1987 with an accelerating growth rate for revenue and profits,&quot; he said. For the nine months, net income rose 2.6% to $114.9 million, or $2.26 a share, from $112 million, or $2.21 a share. Revenue rose 11% to $1.25 billion from $1.13 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
