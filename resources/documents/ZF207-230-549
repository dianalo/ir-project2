Patch editing and  storage now become thecomputer's job.andP;  If your synth has a confusing user interface, ignore it.andO;Use the Mac's interface instead.andP;  If $75 RAM cartridges, with their 64-patchcapacity, are costing you the farm, don't use them.andP;  A standard floppy canhold as many sounds as $2,000 worth of RAM cartridges (around 1,500,depending on the synth's  patch format).andM;Passing patches between your synth and your Mac is the easy part.andP;  So easy,in fact, that pretty soon you'll have so many sounds stored up, you'll wantto start tweaking them, while struggling to keep them organized at the sametime.andP;  Fortunately, technology has a way of expanding to fill the gap, andthat's exactly what editors and librarians do.andP;  Editors let you massage yourpatch data, altering it to suit your specific need.andP;  Librarians let you storeyour patches in a way that keeps them organized and available.andP;  Somelibrarians can handle lots of instruments; some can handle whole families ofrelated instruments; and others, only one.andM;Editors and editor/librarian combinations are typically instrument-specificbecause of the different features different instruments offer, even withinrelated families.andP;  The Roland D-50 is currently the world's best-sellingsynth -- and one that's almost impossible to program from its own frontpanel, making it an ideal candidate for software control.andP;  The packagesdiscussed here come from Opcode Systems, Dr.andP;  T's Music Software, ValhalaMusic, and Beaverton Digital Systems.andP;  They're designed to work with theD-50, but comparing and contrasting the way these programs handle their sixbasic tasks -- storing, sending, auditioning, rearranging, editing, andcreating patches -- should help you in choosing the programs you'll want touse for your own synths, whatever they may be.andP;  OPCODE BE-BOPandM;Opcode Systems is the first name in MIDI editor/librarians, offering moreprograms for more instruments than any other company.andP;  Because they lead thefield in sales, their patch data format is becoming a de facto industrystandard.andM;After you load Opcode's D-50 Editor/Librarian and select the appropriate portand frequency for your MIDI interface, a small piano-style keyboard markedMouseKeys, appears at the bottom of the desktop, along with a window forselecting which type of file to edit: D-50 patches, D-50 reverbs, or Bundles.andO;There are separate files for D-50 patches and reverbs, because that's the waythe instrument handles them (loading patches and reverbs together is donewith the bundle file).andP;  The standard starting choice would be the default,D-50 patches.andP;  Click on OK, and you'll see another window with simpleinstructions on how to set the memory-protect and MIDI functions of the D-50for the program to work.andP;  This is critical information.andP;  To Opcode's credit,they tell you exactly which  buttons to press and in what order, so even ifyou know nothing about a  D-50, you won't get stuck.andM;Once everything is set, clicking OK opens up a bank with 64 blank patches.andO;These correspond to the 64 voices in a D-50's internal memory and arenumbered, just as in the instrument, in octaves: 11- 18, 21-28, 31-38, and soon up to 88.andP;  If you find this confusing, you can select View by ProgramNumbers in the Load/Send menu and see the patches listed as 1 through 64instead.andP;  This can be confusing in a different way, however, since the MIDIprotocol for program numbers starts at 0, not 1.andP;  (Unless you're PhilipGlass, you're probably confused, but don't worry; it'll all make sense whenyou do it.)andM;The Load/Send menu has the choices you need to start work: getting andsending banks and individual patches.andP;  The Get Patch Bank from D-50 commanddoes exactly that, loading the 64 patches in the D-50 into the Mac anddisplaying them on-screen.andP;  The transfer takes  about 25 seconds, the sametime it takes to send a bank the other way.andP;  This is slower than some otherprograms.andP;  The D-50 must be in Play mode when uploading to your Mac.andO;Otherwise, instead of the full bank, you'll get 64 identical copies ofwhatever voice is active at the time.andM;Clicking on a patch selects it for editing, name changes, cutting, copying,pasting, and other manipulations.andP;  With the exception of editing, all ofthese operate in keeping with the standard Mac interface, so renaming soundsand shuffling them into new orders or from one bank to another is simple.andO;Opcode's manual says that up to eight bank windows can be open at one time,but in my tests, the program would hang with more than seven.andP;  PressingOption before clicking lets you grab and drag a patch to any other location.andO;Finally, if Send on Select in the Load/Send menu is on, clicking on a patchautomatically sends it out to the D-50's edit buffer so you  can listen toyour edited patch.andM;Auditioning is done in any of several ways: playing the D-50's keyboard,using the commands in the Play menu; tapping the Mac's keyboard (Z is middleC); or playing the keyboard graphic in the MouseKeys window, which sends MIDInote data out to the synth.andP;  The Play menu commands let you record anoriginal sequence or play any previously recorded sequence that has beenstored to disk in the standard MIDI file format.andP;  The only length limit isavailable memory, and playback can be set to repeat until turned off.andP;  Othercommands set playback to begin automatically whenever you select a new patchor edit a patch setting.andP;  In the case of the latter command, you can saveyour sanity by using it only when you're working with very  short sequences.andM;The MouseKeys window is the most flexible way to explore new sounds and testpatch edits without getting up from your Mac.andP;  It has ten octaves ofvelocity-sensitive keys which, as the name implies, are played with themouse.andP;  Only 3-1/2 octaves are available at a time, but the octave shiftarrows let you pick ranges.andP;  Clicking higher on a key produces a softer note;clicking lower produces a louder one, with the range from lowest to highestvelocity  adjustable through changes in the Key Velocity display at the topcenter of the window.andP;  Click on LazyKeys, and notes will triggerautomatically as the mouse slides across the window.andP;  Repeat causes the mostrecently played note to retrigger at a selected rate until Repeat is shut off.andP;  Another useful feature is the capacity to send notes out on more  thanone channel at a time so that patches can be auditioned in combination withother instruments.andM;D-50 banks have 64 patches and so do Bank files.andP;  Opcode also offers anotherkind of file, called a Library, that is limited only by available memory.andO;Libraries can hold thousands of patches, making them useful for organizingsounds by kind, such as saxophones, strings, or spacey stuff, or by project.andO;Libraries are organized alphabetically, and patches can be cut, copied, andpasted back and forth between them and Banks at will.andP;  Opcode's Librariesalso have settings that let you cull out patches that are duplicates ineither name or data.andM;Now for editing.andP;  In the upper-right corner of both Bank and Library windowsis an Edit button.andP;  Select a patch and then click on Edit, and you'll see anew Patch window and two new menus: Patch and View.andP;  In the window, which isjammed with a clutter of little boxes, numbers, and symbols, are most of theD-50's ``global'' parameters: that is, the settings that affect theinstrument as a whole.andP;  The Patch and View menus contain the commands thatlet you select which patch, or portion of a patch, you want to edit.andM;Each D-50 sound has more than 400 possible settings, a number big enough tohamper even computer-based editing.andP;  Without turning this overview into aD-50 tutorial, suffice it to say that there are seven basic structures withineach patch -- the Upper and Lower settings for Partials 1 and 2, the Upperand Lower Common settings, and the  global Patch settings.andP;  A good D-50Editor must provide access to these structures in a useful way.andM;Opcode subdivides patches differently, into Upper and Lower Tones, eachconsisting of two Partials and their associated Common settings.andP;  These arecombined into two windows, one marked WG/Com (for Wave Generators and Commondata) and one marked TVF/TVA (for Time Variant Filter and Time VariantAmplifier).andP;  This means that you can ask for Upper Tone in the View menu andsee Upper Partial 1, Upper Partial  2, and Upper Common all together in thesetwo windows; or you can ask for Wave Generators and just see the WG/Comwindows for both the Upper and Lower Tones.andP;  Since all these settings areinteractive,  and since there are times when you'll want to come at them froma nonstandard angle, this is good.andP;  But because they're all on the screen atonce, overlapping other windows that can't be put away without canceling theediting session, the resulting visual clutter is initially as daunting asthat of the D-50 itself.andP;  Opcode's  strong point is not clarity of graphics.andO;In addition, choosing to organize the settings differently from Roland meansthat cross-referencing to a D-50 manual or third-party instruction book willbe more  difficult.andM;Actual editing is easy enough, though, once you find the function you want toedit.andP;  Numerical values can be changed by clicking on them and then either byentering new numbers from the Mac's keyboard or  by positioning the mouse sothat the cursor turns into an up or down arrow and then clicking to increaseor decrease the value.andP;  Time-based envelopes like the TVF and TVA settingscan be edited as numbers (click once) or as graphic envelope displays (clicktwice).andP;  In  these special Envelope windows, changes are made by clicking anddragging on boxes at the juncture points of the envelope segments.andP;  Forsettings with lots of nonnumeric choices -- like picking which Partial to useamong the many stored in the D-50's memory -- Opcode has chosen to use pop-upwindows.andP;  If you click on the PCM Partial name, for example, and hold downthe mouse button, you can highlight the partial of your choice.andP;  Once you'vegot it, simply let go to complete the change.andP;  And, finally, you can edit bycopying and pasting  Tones, Partials, or Envelopes within patches.andM;Beyond editing lies patch creation.andP;  Most editor/librarians contain one ormore ways to generate raw material in the form of randomized or shuffledpatches.andP;  Under the Factory menu, Opcode provides four such tools.andO;Constrained Random lets you pick upper and lower  numeric setting limits inthe form of any two patches from an active Library or Bank and then generatesa specified number of random patches within those constraints.andP;  Shade Twocreates patches that are a smooth blend from one selected patch to another.andO;Shuffler scrambles all  the parameters in your active bank or library butdoesn't change their location within a patch; it just moves them around atrandom to the same place in a different patch from the one they started from.andO;Library Sampler, the last tool, doesn't actually generate patches -- instead,it pulls patches at random out of a Library, creating new source material forthe other patch-generating tools or for experimental MIDI orchestrations.andO;DOCTORING YOUR DATAandM;Typically, musician/programmers write MIDI software, but the balance isn'talways even.andP;  Opcode leans to the programmer side; the folks at Caged Artist,whose programs are distributed through Dr. T, lean the other way -- in thiscase much to their program's benefit.andP;  Dr.andP;  T's Roland D-50 Editor/Librarianis a solid, useful program written with the same natural sense of humor andreasonably clear organization as the short, easy-to-read manual thataccompanies it.andP;  The stated goal of the programmers was to make the user'sleft-brain activity optional, and they very nearly succeed.andP;  It doesn't haveas many features as the Opcode package, especially in terms of randomizingpatches, but it is faster to learn, easier on the eye, and lighter on thewallet.andM;The program handles up to four banks of D-50 sounds (each with 64 patches and32 reverbs) at once and lets you shuffle sounds around using the standard Mactechniques.andP;  It loads and sends banks much faster than the Opcode program (10seconds) and has clearer editing procedures, with separate, well laid-outscreens for each of the seven sections of a patch.andP;  In addition, the programoffers a choice between Envelope and Keyboard Bias graphic displays for theTVF and TVA settings, simple ways to swap common data and change Partialtones (the two quickest and easiest ways to create usable new patches out ofold ones), and the best approach to auditioning sounds I've found so far:Mouse Play.andM;At any time while you're editing, all you have to do is hold down the Commandkey, and the entire Mac screen becomes a playing field, with left/rightcursor positioning controlling pitch and up/down positioning adjustingvolume.andP;  In addition, holding down the Option key causes your choice of theD-50's controllers (such as modulation) to be played as well.andP;  This cancreate musically effective riffs  that simply couldn't be played from theD-50's own keyboard.andP;  This is one of its strongest points.andP;  Its weakest isits randomizing, which  works only on one section of one patch at a time,randomizing selected settings within percentages set in the program'srandomization mask.andP;  PATCH OF THE VALKYRIESandM;Valhala's D-50 Editor/Librarian offers four file types: D-50 Patch Banks,D-50 Reverb Banks, D-50 Libraries (similar to the Opcode approach), and BulkData files.andP;  Bulk Data files are used to load  and send pure MIDI data,allowing the program to receive and send  (though not edit) patches,sequences, and other instrument data.andP;  In theory, the program will open andedit D-50 patches in Opcode format as well as its own; but although I'veverified that some people are using it that way, the copy I worked withwouldn't even recognize the  presence of an Opcode D-50 file on a disk.andM;In general, this is a reasonably solid program.andP;  It offers morepatch-generating functions than Dr.andP;  T (though fewer than Opcode), andclearer editing than Opcode (though not graphically as clear as Dr.andP;  T's).andO;For auditioning, it offers sequence recording and playback plus a Keyboardwindow similar to Opcode's, with the addition of sending several types ofcontroller data along with theandM;triggered notes.andP;   The program's most innovative feature is calledandM;PatchSheet, which shows all patch settings in a list that can be scrolledthrough for editing.andP;  Since the cheapest way to buy D-50 patches is inprinted form, PatchSheet provides a simple, if time-consuming, way to entersuch printouts into your Mac.andM;My experience with Valhala's program made me think it could benefit fromseveral small upgrades.andP;  It always opened disk files half-off the bottom ofthe Mac screen, even when there was nothing above, and if sequence playbackwas cut off before the end of the piece, it would occasionally leave notesstuck on.andP;  More importantly, for anyone trying to learn the program, itsmanual is inadequate, poorly organized (there isn't even a table ofcontents), and arrogant.andP;  The program and Valhala's customers deserve better.andO;LEAVE IT TO BEAVERTONandM;Be warned.andP;  The Beaverton D-50 Editor/Librarian is not a program thatbelieves in the standard Mac interface.andP;  But also be eager: While thisprogram is not at all Mac-intuitive and has documentation that ranges betweenoccasionally useful and almost always confusing, it  is also the mostpowerful of the four programs in terms of creating new and useful D-50patches.andP;  If your purpose is to store and load the patches you buy or tradeand to tweak them from time to time, this program is not for you.andP;  But ifyour purpose is to create  astonishing D-50 sounds, take a good long look.andM;The Beaverton system is really two programs in one.andP;  The first, D- 50 BankEditor, is the program used for saving, loading, rearranging, andcreating/randomizing new banks.andP;  The second, D-50 Editor/ Librarian, is ascreen emulation of Roland's PG-1000, the hardware programming unit for theD-50.andP;  Beaverton recommends that you jump between programs using MultiFinder.andO;It's a good idea, if you've got the memory, because shifting by other meanstakes 20 to 40 seconds.andM;These programs are wildly different from the competition, and this can beannoying.andP;  For example, to edit an individual sound you have to extract all64 patches from a bank file, which creates 64 separate patch files on disk.andO;Beaverton recommends putting related sounds into folders, thus turning theFinder's HFS into the equivalent of Opcode and Valhala's Library files.andO;Editing individual sounds from the PG- 1000 emulation is aestheticallysatisfying (lots of screen sliders!) but also demands that you know the D-50pretty thoroughly.andP;  Mucking about here and there won't teach you much aboutthe instrument or  how it makes sounds.andP;  The constant deviations from thestandard Mac interface (like apparent pull-down menus on the PG-1000 screenthat really aren't there and just beep when you try to use them) will drive aMac loyalist crazy.andM;But I'm still impressed.andP;  Beaverton has come up with creative tools that areworth the headache.andP;  First, their approach to patch generation throughrandomization and masking of patch settings is the most extensive available.andO;Second, their CrossTalk system not only lets you shuffle Partial, Common, andPatch data but also lets you filter the data through the randomization mask.andO;Finally, Beaverton has what they call a Universal Algorithmic Slider thatlets you tie together any of the hundreds of D-50 patch settings and adjustthem all from one screen slider.andP;  Such adjustments can be absolute,reflecting the value of the slider position, or relative, taking the sliderposition and adding or subtracting it from the current value of the setting.andO;Furthermore, the masks used in these three systems can be independently savedto disk for later use, letting you create an extensive toolbox of specificmasks for specific tasks, such as brightening, lengthening, crossfading, orotherwise manipulating sounds.andP;  This is power beyond the scope of any othersynth-editing program I'm aware of.andP;  But steel yourself for learning pains.andO;PATCHING IT ALL TOGETHERandM;The kind of librarian, editor, or editor/librarian combination you choose tobuy depends on just how deeply you want to get into the workings of a givensynthesizer.andP;  All four of the packages covered here offer value for themoney, and all four have differences that will make them appeal to slightlydifferent audiences.andP;  D-50 owners interested in librarian features and somemild sound tweaking will find the programs from Dr.andP;  T or Valhala mostsatisfying.andP;  Those who need more features will lean toward Opcode and learnto find their way around a mildly complicated (but well-documented)interface.andP;  Hard-core sound creators will settle for nothing less than thepower in the Beaverton package and will probably love it as much for itsvariations from the Mac standard as in spite of them.andM;And for those who own a MIDI synth other than a D-50, you should still beable to find a package that fits your needs, although your choices in varietyand features may be more limited.andP;  So introduce your synth to an editor orlibrarian -- in no time at all, they'll be making beautiful music together.andO;FREFF IS A COLUMNIST FOR MACUSER AND KEYBOARD MAGAZINES AND HAS BEEN INVOLVEDWITH MICROCOMPUTERS IN THE ARTS FOR TEN FUN-FILLED YEARS.andP;
