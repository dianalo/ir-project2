 They were looking for evidence of corporate software piracy on thecompany's personal computers.andP;  The results of the raid were scandalous: over90% of the Lotus Development Corp. and Ashton-Tate Corp. software examined ondozens of workstations were alleged to be unauthorized copies.andM;The agents also got similar results in raids on Montefibre, a company in theMontedison group, and Elettrocarbonium, a top Italian chemicals firm owned byWest Germany's Siemens AG.andP;  Within days after the Milan raids, the groupcoordinating the raids, the Business Software Association (BSA) ofWashington, D.C., announced that Lotus and Ashton-Tate were filing copyrightinfringement lawsuits against the accused companies.andP;  The BSA also indicatedthat other major Italian companies were under investigation.andP;  Since then, theBSA has been swift to pull off more raids, and legal action has also beenannounced against Enichem Agricultura, a large chemical company based inMilan, and oil firm Maxcom Petroli in Rome.andM;The BSA, whose members include Aldus Corp., Ashton-Tate, Autodesk Inc.,andO;Lotus, Microsoft Corp. and WordPerfect Corp., was formed last October topromote legitimate trade in business software in worldwide markets and tofight unauthorized copying and distribution of software.andP;  A key to the BSA'sstrategies is the &quot;corporate raid&quot;--court-sanctioned surprise attacks atsuspected violators' sites.andM;The BSA chose Italy as the starting point for its activities in Europebecause, as BSA president Douglas Phillips explains, &quot;The level ofunauthorized copying of software in Italy, not only by dealers but byorganizational users, is one of the most egregious in Europe.&quot;andP;  Phillipsclaims that the development and distribution of legitimate software byItalian and international software companies are blocked by piracy.andP;  The BSAalso estimates that software piracy costs the Italian PC software industryabout $500 million in lost annual sales.andP;  The European industry, the BSAestimates, loses over a billion dollars each year to piracy.andP;  &quot;We find lesscopying as markets become more mature,&quot; says Phillips, &quot;but not withoutactions to protect copyrights.&quot;andP;  Losses are lower in the United States, theBSA contends.andM;Giovanni Catalfamo, Lotus' Italian branch manager, illustrates the problem.andO;&quot;In Italy,&quot; he says, &quot;Lotus sells as much software as it does in Finland, butthe hardware market here is 10 times larger than Finland's.&quot;andP;  Even France,the European country thought to be culturally the most like Italy, has morerealistic software sales figures.andP;  According to Paris-based researchersIntelligent Electronics Europe, the ratio of PC hardware sales between Franceand Italy is 1.5 to 1, while the ratio of software sales is 2.8 to 1.andM;The BSA charges that exceptionally high levels of software copying is goingon in Singapore and Taiwan.andP;  The BSA has made recent raids in thesecountries, too--with one distinction: the Far Eastern raids were not oncorporate users but on a mail order operation.andM;Massimo Moggi, senior analyst at consulting firm Nomos Sistemi, says&quot;In-house software piracy isn't always just a widespread random activity insome large Italian firms.andP;  It's often a systematic procedure,institutionalized within the IS division.&quot;andP;  Moggi describes fully outfittedsoftware-copying centers where user manuals are neatly bound and turned outwith the company logo on the cover.andM;The large corporate user tends to play down the problem of piracy within thecorporation.andP;  Montedison categorically denies any wrongdoing, stating that itwas &quot;expressly authorized to duplicate programs&quot; in question.andP;  Lotus'Catalfamo says Montedison's claims are &quot;totally untrue.&quot;andP;  He has challengedMontedison to produce such an agreement.andM;Tarcisio Zucca Alessandrelli, head of IS at Fiat Auto, the country's largestprivate company, says, &quot;I don't believe that cases of codified piracyperformed in bad faith exist in large firms.andP;  But firms often tend toundervalue the problem of unauthorized copying and lack controls against thepractice.&quot;andP;  The bad faith factor is negated, Alessandrelli reasons, by theminuscule part PC software plays in a firm's total IS costs.andM;Montedison called the BSA's surprise raids and subsequent legal action&quot;hyperbolic for the extremely modest sums of money&quot; involved.andP;  Ashton-Tateand Lotus disagree.andP;  The BSA's Phillips, a lawyer with a background ininternational business arbitration and litigation, says if out-of-courtsettlements aren't reached, the prosecution will sue not only forcompensatory damages but also for &quot;moral damages.&quot;andM;Reasons for PiracyandM;This case may be less a matter of malicious malpractice by Italian users asit is an example of lack of diligence.andP;  Giancarlo Abate-Daga, general managerof Milan-based software publisher Editrice Italiana Software (EIS), says,&quot;One reason is the bureaucratic procurement process.andP;  Months can go by beforeauthorization to buy a product comes through.&quot;andP;  However, he does add that,&quot;In Italy, often the last thing we want to do is pay for something we know wecan get for free.andP;  In the case of software, we just ask a friend for a copy.&quot;andM;Nomos Sistemi's Moggi believes that part of the problem is in a trend todelegate large account sales to dealers that are often unprepared to managethe complex IT needs of the user.andP;  He fears software is too often sold aspart of a product, not as a solution to a particular business problem.andO;Dealers are commonly known to push hardware sales by throwing in freesoftware that they copy onto the computer's fixed disk before shipment.andM;Positive steps can be taken to prevent the piracy problem from getting moreout of hand, according to the BSA's Phillips: &quot;Suppliers can do what we atBSA are doing [take legal action against violators], and MIS directors canwork with top management to ensure that firms have realistic softwarebudgets, responsive acquisition policies and strong internal controls toprevent unauthorized copying.&quot;andM;Fiat Auto is one Italian firm that already takes the problem seriously.andP;  AllIS products must be ordered through one office and justified by specificprojects.andP;  In addition, Fiat's Alessandrelli explains, his office stressescopyright regulations to users.andM;Meanwhile, in a nation famed for scandal, the revelations about piracy arebeing met with mixed reactions.andP;  Unlike in the United States, where accusedsoftware copyright violators were prompt to take corrective measures, theItalian companies seem slow to respond.andP;  Abate-Daga of EIS says the BSA'ssuccess in getting the court order to raid the accused companies' premises bysurprise was exceptional in itself but that only through hard legal action,impounding PCs and widespread negative press about violators can thingschange in Italy.andM;According to the BSA, Montedison's response to repeated offers to negotiate,both before and after the raids, has been abrupt--the firm has simply toldthe BSA to stop sending such invitations.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
