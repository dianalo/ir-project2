In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.8783 marks Tuesday, down from 1.8816 marks Monday. But the dollar rose to 134.66 yen from 134.58 yen Monday.    In Tokyo, at midmorning Wednesday, the U.S. unit was trading at about 134.50 yen. Tuesday, it had closed at 134.58 yen.    Sterling rose in New York late Tuesday to $1.6784 from $1.6713, helped by release of better-than-expected United Kingdom trade and current-account data.    Most long-term players -- corporations and investment managers -- remained on the sidelines, dealers said. Therefore, trading mainly consisted of interbank traders playing ranges, moving in and out of the market quickly, they said. From early in the Asian business day to late New York trading, the dollar moved only in a band between 1.8755-1.8830 marks.    The market's underlying sentiment toward the dollar is positive because of the improvement of the U.S. trade deficit in recent months, the strong growth of the U.S. economy, the high level of U.S. interest rates and the market's belief that these rates will ultimately move higher.    However, Monday's intervention by major central banks made a major impression on market participants, traders said. The central banks are determined to prevent the dollar from rising above 1.90 marks, said Bob Hatcher, a dealer for Barclays Bank in New York, and Earl Johnson, a corporate adviser for Harris Trust andamp; Savings Bank. If not for the intervention, the dollar would now be above 1.90 marks, Mr. Hatcher said.    Sterling gained from the announcement that the U.K.'s August current-account deficit shrank to #1.31 billion ($2.2 billion), the second-largest monthly deficit ever, from the record #2.15 billion in July. The merchandise-trade gap contracted to #1.81 billion from #2.65 billion in July. Economists had forecast an August current-account deficit of #1.5 billion and an August trade gap of #2 billion.    Currency dealers anticipate stagnant dollar trading at least until September unemployment figures are released Oct. 7. And they believe hesitancy most probably will persist until the presidential election on Nov. 8, as bullish psychology continues to balance wariness over central-bank intervention.    Mr. Hatcher of Barclays Bank sees the dollar moving in a range of 1.8725 to 1.8900 marks and 134.25 to 135.00 yen until the unemployment figures are released. For sterling, he forecast a range of $1.6750-$1.6900 during the period. And Mr. Johnson of Harris Bank projected that the dollar will stay between 1.85 and 1.90 marks until the election.    Discussing the ramifications of the election for the dollar, Mr. Hatcher said a victory by Democratic nominee Michael Dukakis would cause mild selling, while a victory by Republican candidate George Bush would keep the currency in its present range through year end.    Corroborating the forecasts for a stable dollar, West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg told reporters in Berlin that he would be &quot;very surprised&quot; to see major changes in currency rates until next year, after the new president takes office.    On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold for current delivery rose $2.10 to $397.30 an ounce in moderate trading. Estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces.    In early trading in Hong Kong Wednesday, gold was quoted at $398.55 an ounce.    ---                    Late New York Trading                    Tuesday, Sept. 27, 1988   Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
