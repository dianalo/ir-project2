The work indicates that the presence oforganic sediments and gums in the fuels tested is the principal causeof their poor filterability. Metals and inorganic contaminants also contributedto the filtration problem by adhering to the filter medium, althoughtheir significance is diminished unless there are organic gums and sedimentsbonding them to the filter surface. Electron scan microscopy revealedfuel unfilterables typically to be composed of minispheres of approximately1 {mu}m diameter. Sediment collected from a Jet-A fuel was determinedto be principally composed of nitrogen-containing compounds probablyexisting as polymeric structures, whereas sediment from a JP-5 fuel containedmostly hydrocarbons and some oxygen- and sulphur-containing compounds.21 refs., 6 figs., 8 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
