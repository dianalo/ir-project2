Accordingly, the design of an optimum development planfor a natural gas field always depends on the field parameters, suchas total natural gas reserves, the individual well productivity, thedependence of production rates on the equipment capacity and the stateof depletion of the reservoir, and the gas sales contract. This paperpresents a model for abnormally pressured gas-condensate reservoirs thatcan predict the delivery rates from individual wells to meet a gas salescontract, set the completion schedule for additional infill wells, anddetermine the requirements for compression facilities. The model combinescertain facets of previously published ones in a manner that requireddevelopment and use of some new and some little-known relationships.Analytical methods for calculating gas compressibility factor, dew-pointpressure, volume percent liquid formed during retrograde condensation,and other gas properties have been included.</TEXT></DOC>
