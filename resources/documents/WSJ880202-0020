Last year, a panel of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade upheld a U.S. complaint that quotas on 10 categories of agricultural products violated international trade rules. Japan proposed to remove quotas on all but two of the categories. When other GATT members backed the U.S. position that all 10 quotas should be dismantled, Japan blocked adoption of the panel's report.    As previously reported, however, an American trade official said in January that the U.S. had agreed to accept continued quotas on the two products -- starch and powdered and condensed skim milk -- and to work out with Japan compensation for the restrictions.    A Japanese Agriculture Ministry official yesterday confirmed that Japan wouldn't block adoption of the GATT report and that it will retain controls over imports of starch and powdered and condensed milk.    The eight categories on which quotas will be lifted are processed beef and pork, canned pineapples, tomato juice, ketchup and tomato sauce, fruit puree and paste, processed cheese, grape sugar and other processed foods. </TEXT></DOC>
