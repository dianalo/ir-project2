Bush, addressing the 112 winners of the Presidential Award forExcellence in Mathematics and Science Teaching, lamented thatAmerica's schools do not produce more top performers in thesesubjects.   ``You've seen all the surveys about American students' poorperformance in scientific knowledge compared to their peers aroundthe world. We've all seen it. We agonize over them,'' he said.   ``You're not just complaining about it, you are doing somethingabout it. You're showing that excellence is not just possible inAmerican education, but that it ought to be the norm,'' thepresident said.   Bush lauded the victory of a high school student from Denver inthis year's 20th Internal Physics Olympiad in Warsaw.   ``When the United States began competing in the tournament in1986 some thought that our students wouldn't really have a chanceagainst students from Europe and the Far East. But our teams haveconsistently distinguished themselves, capped by this gold medalperformance,'' he said.   ``This is the standard of excellence that America's students andteachers should aspire to, and that more can attain,'' thepresident said. ``Our problem is not that we don't have Americanstudents excelling in science and math; we just don't see enough ofthem.''   Bush apologized to the teachers for being ``a little bit late''for the ceremony, held in brilliant autumn sunshine in the WhiteHouse Rose Garden.   Nodding in the direction of the Oval Office, he said, ``I wassitting in there trying to solve a few quadratic equations _somewhat more difficult than balancing the budget, I might say.''   He drew more laughter with a call for ``a moment of silence inmemory of those substitute teachers back home.''   The award program, begun in 1983, is administered by theNational Science Foundation. The winners were named earlier thisyear, two from each state and U.S. territories as well as four fromthe Defense Department's schools abroad.   The teachers were headed to Capitol Hill later in the day topresent their ideas for improving education to the Housesubcommittee on science, research and technology.</TEXT></DOC>
