The interval for visual inspections is decreased asa function of the number of inoperable snubbers discovered. With no inoperablesnubbers found, a maximum interval of 18 months plus or minus 25% is allowed.With one inoperable snubber per inspection period, the interval is 12 monthsplus or minus 25%. The proposed change would allow a one-time extensionof the 12 month interval to 20 months plus or minus 25%, for the case whereone inoperable snubber was found.The Need for the Proposed ActionThe proposed amendment is required to prevent unnecessary unit shutdown.Performance of these inaccessible snubber inspections would require unitshutdown due to their location in high radiation zones and the need toerect ladders or scaffolding for inspection.Environmental Impacts of the Proposed ActionThe proposed action would not involve a significant change in the probabilityor consequences of any accident previously evaluated, nor does it involvea new or different kind of accident. Consequently, any radiological releasesresulting from an accident would not be significantly greater than previouslydetermined. The proposed amendment does not otherwise affect routine radiologicalplant effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are nosignificant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposedamendment. The Commission also concludes that the proposed action willnot result in a significant increase in individual or cumulative occupationalradiation exposure. With regard to nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment does notaffect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact.Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiologicalenvironmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment. The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on September 7, 1989 (54 FR 37171). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.Alternatives to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated. The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin connection with the Final Environmental Statement related to operationof San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Units 2 and 3, dated April 1981and its Errata dated June 1981.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff has reviewed the licensees' request that supports the proposedamendment. The NRC staff did not consult other agencies or persons. <ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementof the proposed amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludesthat the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated July 26, 1989 which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,DC 20555, and at the General Library, University of California, P.O.
