SyStemix, which was founded in 1988 and only went publicin August, has developed several avant-garde technologies ingene therapy and related fields that could lead to newtreatments for immune disorders, cancers and geneticdiseases. Its guiding light is Dr. Irving Weissman, aStanford University professor who is one of the most highlyregarded immunology specialists in the country.</LP><TEXT>   Under yesterday's agreement, Sandoz will pay $70 a sharefor four million of SyStemix's shares outstanding and $56 ashare for about two million newly issued shares. The averageprice, about $65 a share, represents a fat premium overSyStemix's recent trading range of around $35 a share.   After the announcement, SyStemix shares soared $19.75 toclose at $53 in national over-the-counter trading. In Zurich,Sandoz closed at 2,410 Swiss francs ($1,718.81), down fromFriday's close of 2,420 Swiss francs.   The agreement may signal a new phase of big-bucksacquisitions in the U.S. biotechnology industry. Ever sincelast year, powerhouse drug makers -- often foreign concerns-- have been paying fat premiums for smaller companies withpromising, cutting-edge technologies. For example,Switzerland's Roche Holding Ltd. bought 60% of Genentech Inc.for $2.1 billion in 1990, a premium of about 66% overGenentech's stock price at the time.   The cash infusions are vital in an industry notorious forvolatile stock prices and heavy spending on exotic, high-riskresearch. Foreign money has found ready takers because WallStreet has run hot and cold on the industry, though U.S.investors in recent months have shown renewed faith inbiotechnolgy.   The prize for Sandoz in gaining control of SyStemix is thework that Dr. Weissman and his team have done in isolatingpurified bone marrow &quot;stem cells,&quot; which are known as thegrandfather of all human stem cells. Scientists say stemcells hold great promise in helping treat various diseases.They also believe that using the purified stem cells couldreduce rejection rates in organ transplants.   SyStemix caused a big splash in November when it announcedthat it had received a patent covering stem cells. Inaddition to the potential for developing treatments, thepatent thrust SyStemix into the middle of the bubbling debateover attempts to patent the basic building blocks of humanlife.   The company also is known for developing a research animalendowed with a human immune system, the SCID-humouse. Butclearly, SyStemix's work in stem cells is what caughtSandoz's eye. &quot;We feel they are redefining the state of theart of biotechnology with their stem cell work,&quot; said Dr.Craig Burrell, vice president of external affairs for SandozCorp., the company's U.S. unit. &quot;They are the world leaders,and their expertise will expand our ability in several keyareas.&quot; He said the high price was justified, partly as a wayto ensure that Dr. Weismann and his scientists stay on board.   SyStemix, Palo Alto, Calif., went public at $18 a sharejust four months ago. Dr. Weissman owns 5.3% of SyStemix,which gives his personal holdings a current value of about$22.5 million, based on yesterday's closing price. But thebiggest potential winner apparently is Eli Jacobs, the NewYork investor who owns the Baltimore Orioles baseball team.Mr. Jacobs owns about 38% of SyStemix, bought before thecompany went public; his shares now have a value of about$162.8 million.</TEXT></DOC>
