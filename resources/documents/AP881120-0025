FRAZIER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Despite the sirens and fire, the drama and thedamage, the takeover of Atlanta's dank, crowded federal prison byCuban inmates a year ago caused only a hiccup in a five-year plan tomodernize it.   Most buildings destroyed or damaged by the 11-day riot alreadywere scheduled for demolition and replacement.   An exception was $1.3 million in damage to the prison industriescomplex, where inmates made furniture, brooms and mattresses, whichhad not been scheduled for replacement. It smoldered for days; partswere saved, parts will be rebuilt.   ``(The destruction) didn't save us any money but I don't think itreally cost us much either,'' said associate warden Garland Jeffers.He said the riot caused a delay of about three weeks in the $63million project. Work resumed soon after the last of the Cubandetainees were shipped to other prisons.   One inmate was killed in the riot, which prison officials nowcall ``the November activities.''   Of the 145 prison guards and other employees taken hostage inAtlanta and Oakdale, La., 10 still receive workers' compensation forrelated psychological problems. A few have left the Bureau ofPrisons but 123 are back at work in the federal prison system, manyin Atlanta.   Half of the 14 buildings at Oakdale were destroyed and thatfacility, opened in 1986 as a short-term holding center for illegalaliens, remains closed.   The riot and takeover by the 1,100 inmates started Nov. 23, threedays after the United States announced Cuba would take back many ofthe prisoners and two days after a similar takeover at Oakdale.   The Cubans had arrived in 1980 on the ``Freedom Flotilla''boatlift and either had criminal records in Cuba or ran afoul of thelaw in the United States.   About 750 regular prisoners are back in the ``Big A,'' as theprison has been known since shortly after it opened in 1902. TheCuban detainees have been paroled or are held elsewhere.   The penitentiary was last modified around 1918 and was one of theblacker holes in the federal prison system for decades. It is theoldest and one of the larger federal prisons.   Outside contractors within the 27-acre prison are buildingrecreational and vocational facilities and new cell blocks that willprovide more open space but incorporate smaller units, lessening thechance of another takeover.   ``The idea is to do away with the claustrophobic feeling, to havemore open areas,'' said Angie Sheffer, executive assistant to WardenJoseph Petrovsky.   She said the prison population is smaller than it has been inyears and is made up of lower-security prisoners, primarilywhite-collar criminals and drug dealers not considered violent.   Despite the classrooms, new chapel, recreation and televisionrooms, library and other amenities being built, the Big A is still aprison.   Rolls of barbed wire drip from the tops of high steel fences.   Tower guards watch every move and there is always the wall,finished in 1910.   A prison fact sheet says the 4,178-foot wall, as much as 37 feethigh, was the largest single concrete structure in the world untilHoover Dam was built on the Colorado River in the 1930s.</TEXT></DOC>
