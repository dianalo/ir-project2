RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court, in a major setback foraffirmative action, today expanded the ability of white men tochallenge court-approved plans giving preferential treatment tominorities and women in government jobs.   By a 5-4 vote, the justices handed civil rights advocates theirlatest defeat in the case of white Birmingham, Ala., firefighterswho say they are victims of reverse discrimination.   The justices said an affirmative action plan agreed to by publicofficials and approved in court may be attacked even years later ina new suit by workers who took no part in the case leading to theoriginal agreement.   Today's ruling marks the third time this year a newly solidifiedhigh court conservative majority has dealt a significant blow toefforts aimed at helping minorities and women overcome bias.   The court in January ruled that state and local governmentsgenerally may not impose racial quotas for public works projects. OnJune 5, the justices erected new barriers for minorities seeking toprove with statistics that they are relegated to lower paying, lessdesirable jobs.   Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the court,dismissed arguments that the ruling threatens voluntary settlementof minority employment discrimination claims.   ``A voluntary settlement in the form of a (court) consent decreebetween one group of employees and their employer cannot possiblysettle, voluntarily or otherwise, the conflicting claims of anothergroup of employees who do not join in the agreement,'' he said.   ``A judgment or decree among parties to a lawsuit resolves issuesas among them, but it does not conclude the rights of strangers tothose proceedings,'' he said.   In a dissenting opinion, Justice John Paul Stevens said theruling could have serious consequences for affirmative action plansagreed to by employers.   The decision ``would subject large employers who seek to complywith the law by remedying past discrimination to a never-endingstream of litigation and potential liability,'' Stevens said.   He said the ruling threatens to undo efforts by Birmingham which``has made a substantial step toward the eradication of the longhistory of pervasive racial discrimination that has plagued its firedepartment.''   Stevens was joined by Justices William J. Brennan, Harry A.Blackmun and Thurgood Marshall.   Joining Rehnquist were Justices Byron R. White, Sandra DayO'Connor, Antonin Scalia and Anthony M. Kennedy.   In other action, the court:   _ Ruled that a jury choosing between the death penalty and a lifeprison term for a convicted murderer generally may not be told aboutthe victim's personal characteristics.   By a 5-4 vote, the justices ruled that a South Carolina murdererunfairly was sentenced to death after a prosecutor told jurors thatthe victim was a religious, community-minded person.   _ Agreed to decide whether manufacturers legally may give somediscounts to wholesalers but not retailers.   The court said it will hear an appeal by Texaco Inc., ordered topay $1.38 million in antitrust damages to 12 service stations in theSpokane, Wash., area.   _ Turned down an appeal by companies involved in treatinghazardous waste aimed at forcing the government to adopt tougherenvironmental rules.   The court, without comment, refused to let the firms sue forstricter standards that could increase their business volume or givethem a competitive advantage over other waste-treatment companies.   _ Rejected an appeal by an aspirin manufacturer being sued for$10 million by the parents of a child who contracted Reyes Syndrome.   The court, without comment, let stand a Wisconsin judge's orderthat the maker of Bayer aspirin reveal numerous company records.   _ Made it easier to recover lawyers' fees for people who windisputes with the government over Social Security benefits.   By a 5-4 vote, the court said the government must reimburse legalfees incurred during administrative proceedings that a federal courthas ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to conduct.   _ Refused to let Montana sheep owners kill grizzly bearsthreatening their herds.   The court, over one dissenting vote, rejected arguments that theowners have a constitutional right to protect their property _ evenif it means killing animals designated an endangered species.   _ Turned away the case of a Marine who died after his wiscomtooth was pulled, and left intact a legal doctrine barring membersof the military from suing over injuries suffered ``incident toservice.''   The court, without comment, refused to reinstate lawsuits againstthe government by the widow of Marine Sgt. Timothy Adkins, whosedeath in 1985 sparked three separate investigations by the Marinesand Navy.   The Birmingham case began in 1974 when city officials and theJefferson County Personnel Board were sued by the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People and blackscharging racial bias in the city fire department.   Eventually both sides reached agreement on an extensive plan thatincludes long-term and interim goals for hiring blacks asfirefighters and promoting blacks to higher ranks. The plan alsoincluded provisions to help women advance.   The Birmingham Firefighters Association opposed the plan. But itsobjections were rejected by a federal judge who issued consentdecrees in 1981 approving the agreement.   At the time, the city's 453 firefighters included 42 blacks. Noneof the department's 140 lieutenants, captains or battalion chiefswas black.   Seven white firefighters then challenged the promotion plan,saying less-qualified blacks were being promoted ahead of them.   A federal judge ruled that the white firefighters were bound bythe court consent decree and dismissed their suit.   But the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in late 1987reinstated the suit, sparking an appeal to the Supreme Court by thecity and county officials and those who filed the 1974 suit.   In a similar case last year, the justices split 4-4 in upholdinga New York City affirmative action plan for promoting more blacksand Hispanics in the city.   Kennedy, the court's newest member, did not participate in thatcase.   The former Reagan administration sided with the white Birminghamfirefighters even though the Justice Department had joined in the1974 suit on the side of those alleging bias against minorities. Thegovernment's position was staked out prior to the Bushadministration taking office.   The case is Martin vs. Wilks, 87-1614.</TEXT></DOC>
