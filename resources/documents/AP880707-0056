Arab assailants hurled two firebombs Wednesday at an Israeli busin west Jerusalem's busy commercial district. Police said therewere no casualties.   Although stone throwing and firebomb attacks have escalatedrecently in east Jerusalem, where 135,000 Arabs live, the attackWednesday was the first time the violence has spread into Jewishwest Jerusalem.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir said the firebombing showed thatthe Arab uprising is a serious threat.   ``This is additional evidence that all this struggle, thisuprising, is not about territorial issues but is about the veryexistence of Israel,'' Shamir told Israel radio.   Also Wednesday, a brick was dropped from the roof of acommercial building in one of the most crowded areas of Tel Aviv,striking the roof of a car on the street below.   Kollek described the firebombing as ``a terrible danger for thepresent and the future.''   ``I think the assailants wanted to prove that in Jerusalem,where life is relatively good compared with the territories,especially here they are in control,'' Kollek said on Israel radio.   Deputy Police Chief Rahamin Comfort told the radio the attack``was a very severe incident. It has great importance because untilnow we did not have such a case.''   After the attack at about 10:30 p.m. on Jerusalem's King GeorgeStreet, a busy thoroughfare packed witIsraeli passersby drew their gunsand chased the suspects.   Police rushed to the scene, stopped Arabs to check theiridentification cards and rounded up 10 suspects for questioning.   Witnesses told The Associated Press the firebombs were hurledfrom the top of a building under construction and thegasoline-filled bottles struck the top of a passing bus beforeigniting on the street.      The firebomb incident marked only the second time the downtownarea of an Israeli city was targeted for unrest since the uprisingbegan in December.   On June 12, Palestinians hurled three firebombs from the roof ofTel Aviv's main shopping plaza. The attack did not cause injuriesor damage. Police detained several Arab suspects.   In east Jerusalem, police closed two schools after Arab studentsburned tires and hurled rocks at riot police, said police spokesmanAlex Lapidot. One officer was slightly injured by a stone and oneyouth was detained, Lapidot said.   Protesters also stoned two buses, and police arrested 11 Arabsuspects, Lapidot said. In one attack, three Arabs fled into eastJerusalem's central bus station, and police fired tear gas into thecrowded terminal before capturing the assailants.   In other developments Wednesday, the army extended for threedays a closure order against all 800 Arabs schools in the WestBank. Army officials have said the schools, which now will reopenMonday, are hotbeds of anti-Israeli violence.   The West Bank's military government ordered Palestinian-rungovernment hospitals to stop treating casualties of the uprisingfree of charge, Arab doctors said Wednesday.   The hospitals, funded by taxes paid by Palestinians, wereordered to charge all patients $175 a night and demand payment inadvance for three nights, newspaper reports said.</TEXT></DOC>
