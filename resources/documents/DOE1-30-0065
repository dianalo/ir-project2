In 1977,the first artificial heat extraction loop was completed and successfullytested. In 1981, wells for 20 - 50 MW were drilled in three dimensionalintervals as designed. In May, 1982, hydraulic fracturing was startedfor the construction of an artifical reservoir. Following 10 experimentsperformed in 1982, a large scale hydraulic fracturing test was made in1983, but failed in conducting the above-mentioned two wells. A separatorwas designed and assembled, and additional 9 surface observation stationswere established. Vent gas from the wells and all water reservoirs inthe area were periodically analyzed for the protection of environment.In the field of reservoir engineering, a great progress was made in themapping technology for micro-earthquake waves. Theoretical study andindoor experiments were also carried out. Approximately 40 geochemicalexperiments were made, and the main result was the elucidation of thebehavior of montmorillonite in high temperature area. (11 figs, 2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
