At a meeting in the Kremlin, Russian President BorisYeltsin and U.S. Secretary of State James Baker announcedU.S. steps to help the former Soviet Union reduce its nucleararsenal and set up facilities to help the scientists whocreated these weapons put their talents to work innonmilitary endeavors.</LP><TEXT>   The Russian leader has a strong incentive to slashmilitary spending because of mounting economic problems. Mr.Yeltsin, acknowledging that both Mr. Bush and Congress wouldhave to agree to extend more grain credits, said yesterdaythat he had &quot;no doubt about a positive response&quot; from theU.S.   The Bush administration already has extended Russia about$3.75 billion in credits to buy American grain. A U.S.official said that about $650 million of that amount hasn'tyet been delivered, but Mr. Yeltsin indicated that thesecredits would be &quot;implemented&quot; by March or April. Now, Mr.Yeltsin is requesting $600 million more in credits.   Following yesterday's meeting, U.S. officials said theadministration would provide Russia with 25 special railroadcars and containers to safely transport and store nuclearweapons and components that ultimately would be dismantledand destroyed. The U.S. also plans to earmark $25 million toset up, along with Russia and Germany, a clearing house tochannel the talents of scientists into peaceful projects,either for their own economy or in conjunction with othergovernments or private companies. This money would come fromfunds previously appropriated by Congress to help the formerSoviet Union.   The U.S. wants to ensure that the nuclear scientistsaren't tempted by outlaw states or terrorist groups to&quot;engage in activities that would result in proliferation ofnuclear, biological and chemical weapons and missile deliverysystems,&quot; according to a statement released yesterday.   These measures are ushering in an arms-control era inwhich the U.S. is playing an active role in helping theformer Soviet Union make the transition to a market economyby shifting resources from military to civilian activities.Mr. Baker underscored this effort last weekend during anextraordinary visit to Chelyabinsk70, a major Sovietnuclear-weapons complex in Siberia once closed to Westernvisitors, where he discussed these efforts with some ofRussia's scientific elite.   At the same time, the U.S. and Russia still arenegotiating traditional arms-control issues, specifically howmuch further to reduce their arsenals of long-range nuclearweapons below the levels they had agreed to before the ColdWar ended. Mr. Baker and Russian Foreign Minister AndreiKozyrev plan to meet today to discuss proposals made recentlyby President Bush and Mr. Yeltsin.   Mr. Yeltsin, at a news conference yesterday, said he wouldmeet in July in Washington with Mr. Bush to discuss the fullrange of U.S.-Russian issues. A U.S. official said yesterdaythat a firm date still hasn't been set.</TEXT></DOC>
