Safeguard said an outside holder &quot;indicated orally&quot; that a group that he represents is &quot;contemplating making an offer of $10 a share to purchase&quot; the company, which had 6.1 million shares outstanding as of Sept. 30, giving the potential bid an indicated value of $61 million. The company said the holder also said that financing had been arranged.    The announcement drove Safeguard's shares sharply lower yesterday. In national over-the-counter trading, the shares fell 87.5 cents to close at $5.50.    The company, which operates prepaid dental plans in 13 states and has been authorized in three others, said it's referring the incident &quot;to the proper authorities for their review.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
