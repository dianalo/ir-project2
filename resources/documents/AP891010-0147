Manuel Antonio Noriega, who survived anothercoup attempt last week in Panama.   ``In Panama there is no longer a constitutional regime, but asimple military dictatorship ... engaging in dramatic excesses,''Perez told a news conference.   Noriega commands Panama's Defense Forces and so controls thegovernment there.   Perez accused that government of executing rebel officersimprisoned after the coup failed.   The government denied news accounts of some coup leaders beingexecuted after surendering, but Perez said he had reports that,``with a great deal of precision ... officers of the PanamanianDefense Forces have been executed while in prison.''   He gave no details nor did he spell out what action LatinAmerica should take.   At the funeral in Panama City on Tuesday of a Defense Forcescaptain involved in the coup, his widow said her husband was killedin prison and did not commit suicide as rumors had it.   Capt. Nicasio Lorenzo was reported to have committed suicide inprison by hanging himself. The official coroner's report said hedied of asphyxiation.   But his widow, Luz Elaine, said Lorenzo was ``a very Catholicman'' who would never have killed himself and vowed at herhusband's coffin, ``I will shout it to the world until justice isdone and the truth is known.''   Panamanian military officials have said eight officers and twosergeants were killed in the rebellion Oct. 3, including itsleader, Maj. Moises Giroldi. Several U.S. reports have said anenraged Noriega personally shot Giroldi to death minutes after thecoup failed.   In Washington, the Bush administration said Tuesday the UnitedStates had flown some coup leaders to Miami, along with members oftheir families.   The United States has tried to get Noriega out for nearly twoyears. It applied economic sanctions against Panama after federalgrand juries in Florida indicted him in February 1988 on charges ofdrug trafficking and money laundering.   Noriega claims all efforts to oust him are part of a U.S. plotto retain control of the Panama Canal after 1999, when it is to beturned over under treaties signed in 1977.   Panama led the agenda for talks between Perez and PresidentFrancois Mitterrand of France, who arrived Monday for a 48-hourofficial visit.   On Monday night, at a banquet for Mitterrand, Perez said theNoriega regime was ``sowing terror (by) executing Panamanianofficers.''   At the news conference Tuesday, he ruled out militaryintervention, saying it ``would be a tragedy for the wholecontinent.'' He added that Latin American action undertaken ``insolidarity with the Panamanian people'' would spare the regionworse evils.   The president declared that Latin America was allowing amilitary dictatorship in Panama despite its repudiation of attemptsto overthrow civilian governments in Argentina, Ecuador and Peru byforce.   That, he said, ``could be a dangerous sign of regression forLatin America's democratic process. It compels us to see ... adictorship in Panama as a threat for the entire continent.''   Observers said the call for joint action could lead to formalexpulsion of Panama from the Latin American Group of Eight, whoseother members are Argentina, Uruguay, Brazil, Peru, Colombia,Mexico and Venezuela.   Panama was suspended early in 1988 after Noriega arranged thedismissal of President Eric Delvalle, who had tried to fire thegeneral as Defense Forces commander.   The Group of Eight, formed three years ago to represent LatinAmerica on major political and economic issues, is to hold atwo-day summit this week at Ica, Peru. Perez said other membersshare his concern about Panama.   Because of Panama's strategic position, Perez said, the crisisthere has ``global implications'' and is Latin America's mostserious problem.   He said the Noriega regime ``lacks legality and legitimacy'' andthe coup attempt demonstrates ``that the Defense Forces' unity isbroken.'' Since the coup, Perez said, Noriega ``has unleashed anincreasing repression whose extent we cannot determine.''</TEXT></DOC>
