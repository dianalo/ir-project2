Donald McKenzie, chief negotiator for Ford Canada, saidthe two sides were &quot;still a fair distance apart.&quot; He added,however, that &quot;now is the time to pick up the pace ofnegotiations.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   The strike has closed nine Ford plants in Canada and hasthreatened to curtail some of the company's key U.S.operations that depend on parts manufactured north of theborder.   Emerging from a brief meeting with union leaders, Mr.McKenzie said the company was still drafting its new offer,which will cover a range of economic issues, including wagesand cost-of-living allowances. Ford Canada officials wouldn'telaborate on the specifics of the proposal.   Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workersunion, took a wait-and-see attitude to the company'swillingness to inject new momentum into the contract talks.Mr. White warned, however, that the union was still preparedto walk away from the bargaining table if there wasn't anyprogress made toward reaching a contract settlement by theend of the week.   But Ford's Mr. McKenzie indicated that the companyexpected movement from the union as well. &quot;If there isn'tprogress over the next couple of days, then obviously we'vegot a major problem.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
