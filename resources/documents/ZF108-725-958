Done judiciously, you can getan extraordinary amount of help from the executive that will guide you indesigning a successful  - in the eyes of the user  - system.andP;  The way toobtain that help is the executive interview.andP;  Get the help you need.andP;  Do notproduce a system that is only a mirror reflection of what they receive today - which may be totallly inadequate.andM;The instructor's suggested procedure:andM;1.andP;  Get on the executive's schedule.andM;You may have to wait 3 to 4 months to  &quot;get on the docket.&quot;andP;  Request twoone-hour time slots.andP;  Never ask for more than one hour at a time.andP;  You don'twant to leave your prospect feeling drained.'andM;During the first interview, you will find out what is important to theexecutive.andP;  During the second, which should be a few days later, you willfind out how to measure the items previously identified.andM;2.andP;  Listen !andP;  A good interviewer must be an active listener.&quot; (We agree!)andO;&quot;There are consultants who are horrible interviewers because they are so busyshowing they are brilliant that they don't listen.&quot;andM;&quot;You don't have to know your prospect's business [in order to listen].andP;  Ifyou don't understand something, ask for clarification.&quot;andM;3.andP;  Have someone else present.andM;It is a good idea to have someone else to act as a second pair of ears  - incase you miss or misinterpret something.andP;  That person does not participate only listens.andM;Avoid  - if possible  - having members of the executive's staff present.andP;  Youwant information  - not speeches.andP;  And not someone else's opinion.andM;4.andP;  Ask the following questions:andM;*   How much do you know about the EIS?andM;What do you think of it?andM;-   If the response is less than positive (&quot;It's allandM;bull!&quot;), dive right in! Get rid of hostility early.andM;-   These are the easy questions; you use themandM;early to get the executive talking, theandM;provocative ones come later.andM;-   Don't use a tape recorder.andP;  You want honestandM;answers  - not guarded responses.andM;*   Having gained some rapport, and whileandM;the tempo of the interview, you advance to theandM;tough questions:andM;A.andP;  After being away on vacation for a week, whenandM;you get back to the office, what are the firstandM;things you want to see?andM;- The answer will tell you which informationandM;is &quot;tactically important.&quot;andM;B.andP;  What enhancements would you like to see toandM;what you now receive?andM;-   The answer could be more graphics, moreandM;detail, less detail, quicker reports, etc.andM;-   The requested enhancements may beandM;enough to make the executive happy - andandM;definitely should be included in the veryandM;first delivery of the system.andM;C.andP;  When you pick up an issue of The HarvardandM;Business Review three years from today, youandM;find an article about you and yourandM;organization telling why things are going soandM;great.andP;  What does it say?andM;-  They often say &quot;What a good question!&quot;andM;- The answer will show the direction in whichandM;they want the organization to move.andP;  That willandM;be &quot;strategic&quot; information.andM;D. Assume you are reading the same type of article,andM;but this time it tells why things are so bad.andP;  WhatandM;does it say?andM;- The answer will not necessarily be theandM;opposite of the previous answer.andP;  It may beandM;&quot;We are not global,&quot; or  We didn't trainandM;properly,' 'Our operation is antiquated,&quot; etc.andM;E. If you had 10 minutes in your competitor's officeandM;(for public sector organizations, you can useandM;(oversight body) and were completelyandM;unobserved, what data would you want to get yourandM;hands on?andM;F. If your competitor were in your office, what dataandM;would he/she want?andM;That should be enough to fill the one-hour session.&quot;andM;&quot;The biggest added value will be in the last 4 questions.andP;  Most often, thatinformation is not included in an EIS.andP;  It is new information.&quot;andM;Before leaving, tell the executive that some of the information is notreadily available.andP;  Set up your appointment for the second interview.andM;The purpose of the second interview is to learn (agree) on how to measure theneeded information.andP;  Information comes in two varieties:andM;1.andP;  Hard data has but one definition and one sourceandM;-     like a stock price.andM;2.andP;  Soft data is much harder to define and to measure.andM;Perhaps nobody knows where to get it!andM;-  Examples: quality in marketing, quality in finance,andM;morale.andM;&quot;Reality is usually somewhere between [hard and soft data].&quot;andP;  The softer thedata, the more creative you have to be to come up with a way to measure it.andO;Get the executive to help you.&quot;andM;The ease of getting the data should not influence which data you use.andP;  It isthe hard to get data that is most likely to provide the best added value.andM;For soft data, it is usually necessarily to accept  &quot;reflective data&quot; thatgives indirect evidence.andP;  Example: to measure morale, collect data on:andM;* turnover ratesandM;* contributions to the suggestion box (which decline during periods of lowmorale)andM;* sick leave and absenteeismandM;* pilfering (the rate rises during low morale)andM;* worker productivityandM;* union grievancesandM;Always ask the executive whom to ask for that data.andP;  (Then the request comesindirectly from the executive  - that adds to the amount of cooperation youwill get.)andM;Do not assume the data must be accurate,' said Wayne.andP;  For soft data,consider how much accuracy is essential.andP;  I would rather be approximatelyright than exactly wrong.andP;  In some instances, you have to work with whateverdata is possible to collect.andM;Finally, prioritize what you learned from the interviews: What is mostimportant to the executive.andM;Wayne warned that most EISs are based on CSF  critical success factors) whichare tactical considerations.andP;  He advises you concentrate instead on the CFFcritical failure factors) which are strategic considerations.andP;  They arequantitatively different'andM;Some practical advice in design:andM;* Avoid forcing the executive to go more than  &quot;4andM;levels down' in a search for data.andP;  It is harder toandM;design menus that comply with that rule.andP;  However,andM;more levels characterize an unfriendly system.andM;* Label each set of data with the date of their lastandM;revision.andP;   That allows the user to avoid reexaminingandM;old data.andM;* In early versions of the system, avoid presentingandM;the users with choices that are not yet operable.andM;(Yes, that would make your later job easier - butandM;nobody said the objective was to make your jobandM;easier.)andM;* Use color effectively but judiciously.andP;  3 or 4 activeandM;colors are enough  - don't use too many.andP;  TheandM;accepted code is:andM;- red means danger! (a problem area)andM;- yellow means active and acceptableandM;- green means go!andP;  (exceptionally good)andM;* When possible (using some imagination), createandM;menus which are &quot;information bearing.&quot; Example:andM;an item on the menu could be a graphandM;summarizing the data.andM;Wayne had slides to show us a sample of a system now in use.andP;  I wasdisappointed.andP;  The system looked wooden, inflexible, awkward to use, and noimprovement over MISs I have seen.andM;Next he showed a long list of  unconventional measures,&quot; which he borrowedfrom Tom Peters' book  Thriving on Chaos.'andM;CAN COMMENT: The idea of using unconventional measures is great, but.andP;  Ithought the examples shown were poor.andP;  Example: for training, it listed&quot;hours/dollars for skill upgrading.&quot; That is a lousy measurement! You canspend lots of dollars and lots of hours on terrible training that upgradesnothing but the vendor's bank account.andP;  A much better example was Wayne's own- which measured morale.andM;&quot;What gets measured, gets done.&quot; When you measure something - anything - itmeans somebody is paying attention to it and that always affects performance.andO;(Experimenters have known about this inevitable response for years.)andO;Performance will be even more affected if everybody knows the executives areinterested in it.andM;When designing the system, don't be satisfied with the first success.andP;  Askyourself -  * Can I make it bigger? Smaller?andM;* Should there be more of it? Less of it?andM;* Can it be faster? Slower, but more complete?andM;Strive for perfection!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
