GEMMSTAR is the subject of U.S. Patent pending number 261,304 (application10/24/88). This machine will be a translation into computer hardware ofan existing software package, Generate, Emulate, and Manipulate Macromolecules(GEMM), developed by the Molecular Graphics and Simulation Laboratory ofthe Division of Computer Research and Technology (DCRT) of the NationalInstitutes of Health. The GEMMSTAR will interface to a host machine, whichwill do other calculations necessary for molecular mechanics and simulations.GEMMSTAR will calculate the compute-intensive pair interaction potentialfound in most molecular simulation codes including a van der Waal termand an electrostatic energy term. Additional terms (such as a pressureand a polarization term) will be incorporated into GEMMSTAR in order tomake the machine more flexible so as to be able to better respond to futuredemands. GEMMSTAR will compute the energy and forces for these potentialenergy terms and save them for subsequent analysis, minimization, or integrationof the equations of motion for molecular dynamics. Development of GEMMSTAR under the agreement will consist of the followinggeneral steps: (1) Participate in a detailed architectural design and simulation. <ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Provide non-recurring engineering funding and design facilities.</ITAG>(3) Provide an appropriate engineering team to the project. (4) Design and supply Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASIC's).The design calls for 50 to 60 copies of a single, new, ASIC. (approximately50,000 gates and 256 pins.)(5) Carry out the mechanical and board layouts, and build and test prototypeboards. (6) Develop system software to support the GEMMSTAR. Applications softwarewill be the responsibility of the Government. (7) Manufacture and market production units. Under the resulting Cooperative Research and Development Agreement, NIHwill grant an exclusive royalty-bearing license for the subject U.S. patentapplication, and an option to acquire an exclusive royalty-bearing licensefor future related U.S. patent applications and patents issued thereon,and those that may result from the agreement. A panel of senior Government scientists and computer specialists from theDivision of Computer Research and Technology will use the following criteriato choose the industrial partner: (1) Demonstrable experience with modern computer and/or chip manufacturingtechniques. (2) Prior manufacture of computers and components and application specificcomputers in particular. (3) Demonstrated experience and ability to market and distribute productionspecial purpose computers. (4) Willingness and demonstrated plan to commit the necessary resourcesto the project, including funding, personnel, design, computation, testing,and manufacturing resources. (5) Likely availability, and ability to interface to, a host machine capableof approximately 200 megaflops, and capable of sustaining close to a 50mbyte/second I/O bandwidth. (6) Willingness to cooperate and collaborate on a regular basis with appropriateNIH scientific and engineering staff. (7) Demonstrated ability to bring this class of product to market in atimely manner. (8) A business plan favorable to the interests of the Government includingreasonable royalties from any GEMMSTAR revenue, and for the retention ofthe exclusive license.
