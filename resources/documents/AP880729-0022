They got the ball rolling this week with the introduction oflegislation prompted by a series of hearings over the last twoyears at which scientists warned that the greenhouse effectthreatens the planet with higher temperatures, climate changes andrising oceans in the next century.   Sixteen senators, including Energy Committee Chairman BennettJohnston, D-La., unveiled a comprehensive plan on Thursday thatcalls for a variety of steps, from developing safer nuclear powerto slowing the destruction of forests in the Third World.   A day earlier, a group headed by Robert Stafford, R-Vt.,submitted a package to end U.S. use of chlorofluorocarbons, thechemicals that contribute to global warming and destroy the Earth'svital ozone layer.   Johnston, who has been identified more with energy developmentand production than environmental protection, said he would hold aseries of hearings in coming weeks to set the stage for 1989.   Next year, he said at a news conference, ``we'll have to beginthe serious process of legislating. We'll act as fast as thepublic's willing to support us.''   Johnston is a cosponsor of most elements in a package developedby Sen. Tim Wirth, D-Colo., that represents the broadest CapitolHill response yet to the greenhouse warnings.   ``The greenhouse effect is the most significant economic,political, environmental and human problem facing the 21stCentury,'' Wirth said.   Johnston, who recently held a hearing on the greenhouse effect,said: ``The evidence of global warming is virtually undeniable. Itis so much more comprehensive, dangerous and life-changing thananything we've ever seen.''   Aides said Johnston has become convinced that global action isnecessary to combat the production of carbon and other gases thatscientists say trap heat in the atmosphere.   Johnston stopped short of endorsing a key element of Wirth'sproposal: reducing carbon monoxide emissions by requiring new carfleets to average 55 miles per gallon by 2010, a doubling of the1985 fuel efficiency standard.   The Wirth package would force this country to reduce carbondioxide emissions by 20 percent by 2000. Scientists estimate thatcarbon dioxide, coming mostly from fossil fuel combustion, producesabout half the world's greenhouse gases. The United States is saidto be responsible for 20 percent of the world's carbon dioxideemissions.   The proposal would require administration officials to draft anational energy plan emphasizing the least expensive ways to reducefossil fuel use and increase use of renewables such as solar energy.   The package would authorize about $1 billion through 1992 forresearch and development of non-fossil energy sources and a newgeneration of safer and cheaper nuclear reactors. It also calls forgreater reliance on cleaner-burning natural gas for heating andtransportation.   On the international front, the secretary of state would beurged to hold a meeting aimed at getting other nations to commit toa 50 percent cut in greenhouse gas production by 2015.   The legislation also would authorize this country to spend morethan $1.5 billion in the early 1990s to provide birth controlinformation in an effort to slow the demand for fossil fuels inburgeoning nations.   It also calls for the United States to work throughinternational lending and development agencies to slow thedestruction of forests, which consume carbon dioxide when alive butwhich emit huge amounts when they are cut down.   Johnston said that to slow down polluting development in theThird World, ``we're going to have to pay for their non-developmentin some way, and it's going to be expensive.''   Joining as cosponsors were Max Baucus, D-Mont.; Jeff Bingaman,D-N.M.; Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.; John Chafee, R-R.I.; John Danforth,R-Mo.; Wyche Fowler, D-Ga.; Albert Gore, D-Tenn.; John Heinz,R-Pa.; Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii; John Melcher, D-Mont.; ClaibornePell, D-R.I.; Spark Matsunaga, D-Hawaii; Terry Sanford, D-N.C.; andRobert Stafford, R-Vt.</TEXT></DOC>
