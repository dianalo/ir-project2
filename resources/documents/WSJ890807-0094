The Pentagon, as is its custom, won't say a word about the classified mission. But outside space experts, as is their custom, are ready to spill the beans.    Trouble is the experts disagree over whether Columbia will carry a radar satellite that can see through clouds, a photo satellite that can make out license plates or, maybe, a signal-intercept satellite that can pick up Soviet missile tests. &quot;It's a guessing game,&quot; admits William Burrows, a New York University journalism professor who wrote a book about spy satellites. &quot;We're trying to be oracles.&quot;    Divining the U.S. capability to spy from space on the Soviet Union is devilishly tricky work. Satellites orbit far beyond sight, and the Pentagon tries to disguise its launches, sometimes misleading reporters. Space sleuths hunt for satellite descriptions made public at spy trials or congressional hearings, and combine that with launch information leaked to news organizations to predict which satellites the U.S. will launch and when.    The reporting gives U.S. intelligence agencies fits. William Odom, former head of the secretive National Security Agency, which eavesdrops by satellite on foreign communications, says the Soviet Union &quot;turns up defensive measures ferociously&quot; after reports of new U.S. spy satellites.    But private military-space researchers contend that the public should know more about the ability of spy satellites to photograph Soviet missile bases and intercept weapons-test results. &quot;That can improve public confidence in American capabilities to police arms-control treaties,&quot; says Paul Stares, a Brookings Institution space scholar.    Nearly all reporting on spy satellites begins with Aviation Week andamp; Space Technology, an influential trade magazine dubbed &quot;Aviation Leak&quot; at the Pentagon. In the past year, Aviation Week broke the stories that the space shuttle Atlantis would carry a new radar satellite code-named Lacrosse that can see at night and through clouds, and that the Titan 4 rocket would launch a new satellite to warn of missile attacks. The magazine also reported in May that a Titan 34D rocket launched two communications satellites, but later ran a correction after the Pentagon called to complain that it really launched a single signal-gathering satellite instead.    On military-satellite stories, Aviation Week works with Pentagon sources that are never named, and makes predictions that frequently can't be fully confirmed. But its reports become gospel as larger news organizations embellish and recirculate them.    The day Aviation Week published its Lacrosse story, for instance, United Press International, Reuters and even the Chinese news agency Xinhua spread the report world-wide. But the best confirmation the magazine could offer that its original story was true was when the shuttle Atlantis headed in a northerly direction from Cape Canaveral. That indicated that the satellite would head over much of the Soviet Union, as predicted. But this gave no indication that the satellite was equipped with radar -- the nub of the Aviation Week story, and a crucial technology to track Soviet mobile missiles that might move at night.    For tomorrow's planned shuttle launch, Aviation Week predicts that the Pentagon will loft an advanced photo satellite, codenamed the Strategic Response Satellite, over the Soviet Union. But other spy-satellite watchers figure the shuttle will launch another Lacrosse instead. Amateur astronomers will help settle the debate by tracking the satellite's altitude -- photo satellites generally orbit 100 miles up; radar satellites can orbit a few hundred miles higher than that.    Ironically, the Soviet government will quickly know the truth because its sensors can detect radar transmissions overhead. &quot;The Pentagon is only hiding the information from the American public,&quot; says Allan Krass, a Hampshire College physicist and arms-control expert.    To keep satellites secret, the Pentagon sometimes constructs elaborate lies that only become apparent years later. Early in the space age, for instance, the U.S. heavily promoted its Discoverer series of satellites as investigating the effects of space on small animals. But years later, it became clear that the real purpose of Discoverer was to develop technology for Corona, a Central Intelligence Agency reconnaissance satellite that snapped detailed photos of Soviet airfields and missile bases.    More recently, claims Mr. Burrows, the space author, the Pentagon tried to mislead a New York Times reporter about the cargo in a secret shuttle launch by revealing the satellite's unusual initial orbit, which differed from the path normally taken by spy satellites. That masked the satellite's real purpose of orbiting high above the globe picking up communications and data on missile tests. Wayne Biddle, the Times reporter who now works as a free-lancer, doubts he was deliberately misled. &quot;If there was an error made, it was through lack of information, not disinformation,&quot; he says.    Given the uncertainty about the reliability of Pentagon leaks, Mr. Krass, the Hampshire College physicist, studies technology instead. Military satellites are at least as good as civilian ones, he reasons. So the best U.S. photo reconnaissance craft should be able to match the quality of NASA's most advanced space camera, the Hubble Space Telescope, which is scheduled for launch early next year. He calculates that pointing the space telescope down at earth, as a military version would certainly do, would produce pictures with details as small as four inches.    Spy trials also help. Jeffrey Richelson, who has written four books on intelligence collection, says the U.S. admitted the existence of the Keyhole, or KH, series of photo satellites in 1978 when it prosecuted a CIA official for selling a KH-11 manual to the Russians.    John Pike, a space analyst for the Federation of American Scientists, keeps spy-case tidbits, plus orbital characteristics of U.S. satellites and reports from congressional hearings and the press in a computerized data bank listing 20,000 satellites and other space cargo. Putting together apparently unrelated space facts -- for instance, the crew of the shuttle Columbia trained earlier to launch a reconnaissance satellite -- helps him piece together information about planned classified launches.    His greatest joy comes on those occasions when he uncovers new satellite programs unwittingly revealed in government launch records. He calls one of his recent discoveries Jeroboam -- a giant-sized bottle of champagne -- because he estimates it will be twice as big as a spy satellite called Magnum. &quot;I'm like a comet watcher,&quot; he says. &quot;If you discover a new comet, you get to name it. If you discover a new satellite, you get to name that, too.&quot;    ---@ Military Space Launches And Their Likely Cargoes @DATE LAUNCHER PAYLOAD @December 1988 Shuttle Atlantis Lacrosse radar satellite @May 1989 Titan 34D Signal-gathering @ satellite @June 1989 Titan 4 Missile-warning @ satellite @August 1989 Shuttle Columbia Lacrosse radar satellite @ or photo-reconnaissance @ satellite @Late 1989 Titan 34D Two Defense Satellite @ Communications System @ satellites @December 1989 Shuttle Discovery Magnum communications- @ interception satellite @Early 1990 Titan 4 Advanced photo- @ reconnaissance @ satellite @Source: Aviation Week; space analyst John Pike, Federation of American Scientists </TEXT></DOC>
