The message Israel Galeano had for the fighters of the QuilaliBattalion on the day after Christmas at their Honduran base campwas blunt and unforgiving.   Luis Adan Fley, he said, was a traitor.   ``If I return, he'll have me shot,'' said Fley. ``This is whathe said to the troops of the Quilali.''   Under Central American peace accords, the ruling Sandinistas inNicaragua offered amnesty to all members of the U.S.-supportedContra rebel force, which has been fighting to overthrow theleftist government.   Fley became the only active rebel commander to accept amnestyand return home before the electoral hand plays out Sunday.   Why did the man best known by his nom de guerre, ComandanteJohnson, defy the rebel high command and leave his comrades-in-armsafter eight hard years?   ``There are two groups inside the resistance: those fighting forpower and those fighting for the democratization of Nicaragua,''Fley said. ``If I'd been fighting for power, I would have stayed.''   Fley said he came home because he believes the new Nicaraguanbattleground is _ finally _ the ballot box. The time has arrived,he said, for ``the people to decide with their vote'' what kind ofgovernment they want.   ``The armed struggle has borne its fruit,'' he said last weekduring a campaign rally in Matagalpa, his hometown 60 milesnortheast of Managua, for the 14-party opposition alliance tryingto unseat the ruling Sandinistas.   ``The Sandinistas have embarked upon a process ofdemocratization and to elections. The armed struggle isn'tjustified anymore. It would only be justified if the Sandinistascommitted fraud or refused to hand over power,'' he said.   With more than 1,000 international observers, Fley thinks thepossibility of fraud is ``remote'' and he is convinced theSandinistas will lose.   ``I don't have any doubt. I've been all over Nicaragua and I amsure UNO (the United National Opposition) will win by a 3-1margin,'' he said.   The UNO slate is led by publisher Violeta Barrios de Chamorro,President Daniel Ortega's principal opponent.   If Fley is wrong and the Sandinistas win, the Contra veteraninsists he is ready to recognize an honest Sandinista victory andremain in Nicaragua as part of the peaceful opposition.   ``I've been influenced by the changes in Europe. Systems havebeen changed without a shot being fired,'' he said. ``Why can't wedo this?   ``We're a backward country; we resolve all our problems withbullets and with killing anyone who thinks differently. We have toevolve and imitate these (European) countries,'' he said.   Fley, 39, said he doesn't believe the Sandinistas, ifvictorious, will risk international condemnation by stifling thepeaceful opposition.   ``They can't begin jailing all their opponents, sending theminto exile and killing them,'' he said. ``They have a lot ofcredibility problems abroad and economic problems. They need theopposition to have a credible government.''   Sandinista leaders have made it clear they expect cleanelections to bring improved relations with the United States andsubstantial international help in rebuilding an economy shatteredby war, U.S. economic embargo and mismanagement.   Fley, who was running the Contra office in Tegucigalpa, theHonduran capital, said he began negotiating his return a few daysbefore Christmas. He agreed to renounce the armed struggle inexchange for government guarantees that he would not be``investigated, detained, persecuted or drafted into the military.''   Although Fley's decision to return is unique among the seniorrebel commanders, it illustrates the hopes raised by the electionas well as the deep gulfs that must still be bridged before therecan be national reconciliation.   Two brothers, both officers in the Sandinista army, were on handto greet Fley when he returned Jan. 8 along with eightlower-ranking Contras. A third brother had died in a rebel ambushin 1987.   Fley and his 32-year-old brother Francisco had fought togetherwith the Sandinistas in the 1979 revolution that ousted the Somozafamily dictatorship.   They had last seen each other in October 1988. Francisco, now acaptain, was leading a mission charged with persuading Fley tocommit 1,200 rebel troops to a cease-fire in Matagalpa province.   But Fley, deeply suspicious of the Sandinistas, instead took hisbrother prisoner to embarrass the army. They spent eight daystogether in the hills, trying to persuade each other to stopfighting.   Neither budged.   Although Fley has come home believing Nicaragua is on the roadto democracy, much remains the same. He has talked with Francisoand with his other brother Jorge, a lieutenant, only briefly sincehis return.   ``It's always the same rhetoric that their chiefs say. Theynever say anything else,'' Fley said.   Jorge, 29, agreed there has been no political rapprochementamong the brothers. But he still believes his elder brother'sreturn offers hope for peace and reconciliation.   ``I think Luis has taken an important step,'' Jorge said. ``Heis well known among the Contras; he commanded a lot of men. It's astep toward peace in Nicaragua.''</TEXT></DOC>
