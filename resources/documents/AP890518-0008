Two of the burned workers were in critical but stable condition,and the third was in serious condition, said Kathy McGowan, aspokeswoman for New York Hospital-Cornell Burn Center.   The other nine workers were treated at two hospitals anddischarged.   The workers were installing a 26-foot rail between two stationsin Brooklyn and had placed a protective rubber mat across the thirdrail.   Apparently ``the rail they were installing somehow slit the matand came in contact with the third rail,'' said Caren Gardner, a TAspokeswoman. The mat was sent for testing to determine it wasslashed, she said.   It is standard operating practice not to shut off electricity tothe third rail while crews are installing a single rail, Ms.Gardner said.   The Transit Authority will convene a board of inquiry on Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
