While the boom in videotex information services deliveredby PC keeps receding into the future, the market forinformation and entertainment services delivered viatelephone lines has exploded, with analysts predicting growthrates of 40% or more over the next five years.</LP><TEXT>   The range of telephone-information services is limitedonly by the entrepreneurial imagination. Most are toll-free800 numbers or 900 numbers, for which callers pay. There areservices that virtually everyone has called at least once,such as time, weather or sports numbers. Adult and chat linesare commonplace and profitable, too, although analysts saytheir use is now declining.   But the variety of services that can be easily accessedsimply by poking numbers and letters on a touch-tone phonegoes much further. Is your diet center's appetite for cashhard to swallow? Call the USA-DIET line and a computerizedvoice will direct you to punch in personal information onyour age, height, weight and medical history beforedelivering a custom diet plan for about $30 a month. Tired ofarguing with the know-it-all next door over the outcome of anold boxing match? Button his lips by calling Boxing Line andhaving him listen to the bout's blow-by-blow as it wasrecorded 40 years ago.   Brokerage firms and banks, many having abandoned attemptsto serve customers using home computers, are beginning tooffer account information and even transaction services bytelephone. Newspapers are augmenting printed information withquick updates via phone. And advertisers are beginning to usethe new lines to promote their products.   There's even a line that tells you how to set up a line.Call 900-USA-INFO and a recording by W. Brooks McCarty, whoruns a one-man company called Information 900 Service Corp.,based in New York, will tell you how. It costs about $12 forthe average 11 minutes it takes to get the information. Mr.McCarty has also designed a system that will set up acustomer's program at no upfront charge, although he keeps 20cents on each call that's made to the number. &quot;I can takeyour order, run it through my system and have you operatingby tomorrow,&quot; he says.   With much of the telephone-information business --commonly referred to as audiotex -- still in private hands,its size is hard to gauge. But Link Resources Corp., a NewYork research firm, says that phone company revenue alonefrom carrying telephone-information traffic will grow 54% to$825 million next year from $550 million in 1990. By 1994,revenue will hit $1.5 billion, says Stephen Reynolds, Link'svoice information services analyst.   But that estimate includes only calls to 900 numbers. Itdoesn't cover revenue that programming companies take in. Nordoes it include revenue from local information services suchas weather lines and toll-free or sponsor-paid 800 calls,advertising and promotional services or even equipment sales.   Meanwhile, the videotex market, led in particular byProdigy Service Co., a joint venture of InternationalBusiness Machines Corp. and Sears, Roebuck andamp; Co., had revenuetotaling $234 million last year and is growing about 25% ayear, says Mr. Reynolds.   &quot;All the projections suggest that {audiotex} is going tobe a very big medium,&quot; says Andy Fraser, Saatchi NorthAmerica's executive vice president and director of businessdevelopment. &quot;Of course, we're looking at it.&quot;   Andrea West, national marketing manager for AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph's MultiQuest audiotex transmissionservices, sees the telephone-services market maturing: &quot;Inthe past six months, we've seen a shift in the market fromsheer entertainment programs to things like hot lines forsoftware customers, magazine subscriptions and travel linesfrom companies such as Avis and the airlines.&quot;   Companies are using 900 and 800 numbers to promote newproducts and conduct surveys. Teleline Inc., a voiceinformation services company, is working with Japan's Isuzuto set up a line that would promote its cars and trucks --and be entertaining enough that consumers would be willing topay for the call. Callers would dial chronic fibber &quot;JoeIsuzu&quot; for the lie of the day. &quot;Let's say the advertiser gets45 cents per call,&quot; says Robert A. Lorsch, Teleline'spresident. &quot;If 15,000 calls come in a day, that's $6,750 aday, or $209,250&quot; after a month. At that rate, which Mr.Lorsch says is about the number of calls he would expect theline to generate, income from the calls would pay forpromotion of the phone line. In other words, the campaignwould pay for itself.   Audiotex also can be an extremely accuratetarget-marketing tool. Callers' phone numbers,computer-matched with addresses from directory data bases,can be used to draw up a profile of customers and theirbuying habits, or as a mailing list of consumers who havealready shown an interest in a company or its products.   In the proposed Isuzu campaign, for instance, dealersmight get the name and phone number of the caller and replywith a thank you and an offer to test drive an Isuzu. &quot;Youcan target the customer so directly,&quot; Mr. Lorsch says.   Marketers also see big potential for 900 numbers inbilling. A customer would order something -- a magazinesubscription, for instance -- and the bill would appear onhis monthly telephone bill. The stumbling block is liability.Phone companies are wary of being held responsible if aservice or good is delivered late or damaged.   Things weren't supposed to turn out quite this way. Thecomputer industry had high hopes customers would use PCs andmodems hooked up to phone lines to bank from home, orderairline tickets and play games. But &quot;many videotex servicesrequire you to become a junior computer weenie,&quot; saysMitchell Kapor, chairman of On Technology Inc. and founder ofsoftware giant Lotus Development Corp. &quot;The phone isbrainlessly simple to operate.&quot;   Companies such as Citibank and Northern Telecom Inc. havephones with screens attached to them that combine the simpletouch-tone pad with a small computer screen to facilitateorder entry and other interactive communications services.ATandamp;T is said to be working on a similar audiotex phone.   Some computer industry experts think audiotex couldactually help develop the videotex market by introducingcustomers to electronic information services. But aside fromthe simplicity of using the phone, videotex lacks a networkcomparable to the nation's phone system. Mr. Kapor adds thatthe computer industry is hobbled by networking problems thatprevent users on one videotex system from communicating withPCs on other systems.   Also retarding videotex are start-up costs. A new phoneinformation service can get started for as little as $50,000,including writing and recording the program, hiring thetalent and advertising, says Mr. Lorsch.   A recent study of audiotex users by Saatchi andamp; SaatchiAdvertising, New York, shows they differ from nonusers not byage or background but by &quot;their ego structures,&quot; says DoreenDoell, vice president and associate research director atSaatchi. Users have &quot;a fear of the unknown related to wantingand needing to know what the future holds. For these peoplethe anxiety becomes overwhelming.&quot; The challenge, she said,is for advertisers and their clients to create thisoverwhelming desire among nonusers, who consider the linesfrivolous and associate them with porn lines and chatservices.   The audiotex industry has already formed its own NationalAssociation For Information Services to police itself againstmarketing abuses before regulators step in. Phone companies,excluding long-distance carriers, by law can't own theinformation they transport over their networks and they mustgive any information provider access to their publicnetworks. But some, including ATandamp;T, put many of the adultlines out of business when they stopped providing billingservices to the lines.   Don't bury the adult lines yet, however. After ATandamp;T'smove, the more resourceful providers simply switched theirnumbers to toll-free 800 lines and let Visa and MasterCard dotheir billing.   ---                      The Audiotex Boom                                                                                                        `900' phone line market share based on minutes of usage                                                                                                                Entertainment                    68%         Live conversation                15%         Polling                          10%         Product andamp; event promotion         5%         News, financial andamp; other           2%                                                                                                        Source: Link Resources</TEXT></DOC>
