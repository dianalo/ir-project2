(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   ``The Milagro Beanfield War'' is a storyof one man's battle for the right to water for his northern NewMexico fields, but it has a universal theme _ the fight to preservea traditional way of life, the author says.   The story, and the film version produced by Robert Redford andMoctesuma Esparza that opened Friday, will reinforce people whooppose the impersonal march of progress, says John Nichols, authorof ``Milagro.''   ``Yeah, hopefully books like mine or a film like `Milagro' can... help to create an atmosphere where people struggling at alllevels of society have just a little more on their side,'' the Taosresident said in a telephone interview.   Nichols, who won't see the movie until its New Mexico premieretoday, said the story celebrates the fight against the ``fascist,nihilistic, anti-hero, everybody-out-for-themselves-oriented''aspects of society.   The main character, handyman Joe Mondragon, bucks the politicaland economic system when he illegally diverts water from a resortdevelopment into his once-abandoned beanfield.   Such wars have punctuated the modern history of northern NewMexico. In Nichols' and Redford's view, the buying or stealing ofwater and land for commercial enterprises threatens to wipe out thetraditional, subsistence farmers, descendants of Spanish settlers,by making their simple lifestyle impossible.   In most of his 19 years in New Mexico, Nichols has embraced andparticipated in traditionalist causes.   In the early 1970s, he lampooned state water officials ineditorial cartoons, designed and distributed protest flyers againstthe construction of a dam and researched titles to find out whoreally held the land and the power in Taos Valley. In recent years,the fight has been against a proposed mining slurry reservoir and abypass road that is eating up farmland around Taos.   ``It is not acceptable for progress, American style, to throwaway cultures or human beings; to commit cultural genocide onanybody that gets in the way,'' Nichols said.   Nichols expected to be treated well by Redford and Esparza intheir film version of his 1974 novel.   ``I've always had a real trust for Moctesuma Esparza's andRedford's instincts. And both of them certainly have a long trackrecord of real concern and involvement in everything from theenvironment to culture, things I believe are important causes,''said Nichols.   Redford is well-known for his environmentalist work and Esparzais a film chronicler of the Hispanic world.   The New Mexico premiere of the movie will be joined by parades,art shows, contests, and $100 and $500 receptions to benefit asheep and wool cooperative, a private community grant foundation,an Albuquerque theater group and the legal aid agency of northernNew Mexico.   ``Obviously, my hope is that once all the glamour and the hoopladie down over the film, that it will be a loving and compassionatemovie with, you know, important cultural and political points tomake that will endure,'' said Nichols.   Many residents of Truchas, the mountain village where the filmwas shot, got parts in the movie or had other jobs with theproduction and will attend a special showing of the film.   Truchas embraced the film after the project was rebuffed byresidents of Chimayo, a small village about 30 miles northeast ofSanta Fe.   Redford had approached residents of Chimayo because the town'sold buildings and central plaza were ideal for scenes in the movie.   But a small group of Chimayosos opposed the project, saying itwould disrupt their lives, and Redford was forced 10 miles upstreamto Truchas.   Nichols said he was not surprised.   ``I thought they had every right in the world to protest thefilming in their town, and what's more, the people, the press andeveryone else should have respected that right without question,''said Nichols. ``Believe me, I think the integrity of the communityis a lot more important than making temporary bucks off a film.''</TEXT></DOC>
