Investor disbelief that the government would maintain theprogram's freeze on the peso-dollar exchange rate was a leadingcause of capital flight, the Center for Private Sector EconomicStudies said in a review of the Mexican anti-inflation program.   Investors fearing a sudden peso devaluation made advancepurchases of capital goods from abroad, sustaining economic activityand increasing imports of items such as machinery despite thegovernment's efforts to slow it, the report said.   However, some $700 million in capital returned to Mexico inJanuary, even after the government instituted a gradual pesodevaluation, the central bank announced last week.   The Center's report, based on government and central bank data,was released over the weekend.   The government did surpass its chief economic policy goal lastyear by halving an inflation rate that reached a record 159.2percent in 1987. Consumer prices rose by 51.7 percent in 1988 underthe program that froze the dollar-peso exchange rate, the minimumwage and prices for government-regulated goods and services.   But despite its initial success in curbing inflation, thegovernment failed to overcome ``general skepticism towards theprogram's viability,'' said the Center's report.   The result was ``a wave of speculation'' by nervous investorsthat prompted capital flight, it said.   Pre-payments of private sector foreign debts and depressed exportrevenues from oil also contributed to the run on reserves, it said.   In addition, the program's wage and price freezes cut workers'real purchasing power by 15 percent last year and created pricedistortions for regulated goods and services, the Center said.   Shortages developed for some basics, including meats, milk andcertain vegetables, as producers withheld their product from themarket to protest official prices they considered too low.   The plunge in reserves prompted President Carlos Salinas deGortari to adopt the gradual currency devaluation Jan. 1 that isaveraging one peso per day.   The private sector financed imports through non-oil exportrevenue and with credits from outside the nationalized bankingsystem. Representing 90 percent of total Mexican imports, capitalgoods imports between January and October 1988 surged by 55.4percent over the same period in 1987.   Consequently, the economy actually registered 0.5 percent growthin 1988, although ``the hoped-for recession...only began to developtowards the end of the year,'' the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
