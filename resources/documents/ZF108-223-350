So the state legislature, inthe interest of an open and just society, recently passed the first lawdesigned to counter the dangerous effects of folklore on the welfare ofdisadvantaged creatures.andP;  New York has at long last instituted a huntingseason for turtles.andP;  For starters, the law applies to the diamondbackterrapin, a kind of turtle, but we are confident that the noble experimentwill succeed and the rest of the armoured reptiles will get similarconsideration.andP;  In the meantime, the terrapins will, as we understand it, bepermitted to hunt.andP;  And we figure that the first thing they will want toshoot at is a rabbit.andP;  Any kid who ever had a box turtle knows that it eatslettuce.andP;  So does a rabbit.andP;  Obviously, the rabbits have been beating theturtles to the lettuce all along.andP;  Life isn't a fable.andP;  Hares don't sleepwhile the terrapins hog the salad bar, munching the lettuce and gettingcheap, gummy thousand island dressing in the artificial bacon bits.andP;  But now,in New York, armed, duly licensed terrapins will be able to blast thosebunnies into smithereens and get the lettuce and other dishes best eatencold, like revenge.andP;  Revenge is precisely what tortoise IBM has in mind as itattempts bunnycide on the growing population of small, swift companies thatinfest what it sees as its field.andP;  IBM is trying to shoot down hardwaremakers, software houses, leasing companies and service firms - somewhatindiscriminately.andP;  These enterprises have been nibbling away at IBM's presentbusiness and future prospects.andM;By Hesh WienerandM;Individually, only a few have consumed very much - DEC, Microsoft andComdisco come to mind.andP;  Others have eaten more modest but nonethelesssubstantial portions of IBM's lunch - Sun, Compaq and refurbishers AMI, forinstance.andP;  Countless other companies have individually nibbled butcollectively devoured additional billions of dollars in business.So, now morethan ever, the tortoise is on the hunt.andP;  And, where possible, it is shootingto kill.andP;  Armed terrapins will undoubtedly experience some of the growingpains its fellow Empire Staters at an Armonk company have undergone whilelearning to kill for sport and table.andP;  Even a glance at the newspapers duringhunting season reveals the pastime's inherent danger.andP;  Seasoned licensedgunsels routinely take out Bossy while aiming at Bambi.andP;  Imagine thepotential for harm a turtle with a carbine harbours, and a turtle, unlikeIBM's management, only has to make up one pea-sized mind before it aims.andO;Surely, one thinks, IBM, with all its wisdom and other resources, cannot becompared to a yuppie that just bought a $3,000 hand-carved Orvis shotgun,hoping to put a perforated pheasant under glass.andP;  Or to an armed terrapin,for that matter.andP;  Perhaps one should examine the record, which IBM has and,unfortunately, turtles do not.andP;  IBM has tried to kill DEC minis in the past,firing 8100s, Series/1s and 9370s.andP;  IBM's missiles weren't exactly duds, butthe only carcasses visible after the smoke cleared were those of thecompany's sales reps.andP;  IBM may be trying again with its RISC machines.andP;  It'stoo early to tell how the RS/6000 will affect DEC. We probably will neverknow.andP;  The IBM-DEC situation reminds us of a story from our small- townchildhood.andP;  A buck trying to cross the road was run down by a fellow in apickup.andP;  It was hunting season, so the driver took out his rifle and shot thedead deer.andP;  IBM's accident-prone nature is not confined to mishaps whileDEC-hunting.andP;  Compaq has also been in the crosshairs of Dead-eye-B-M.andP;  Andit's pretty clear whose portables have been shot down in the market.andP;  IBM maynever get off a fatal shot at its most distinguished PC rival, either,because Toshiba has zeroed in on the lightweight market.andP;  Having failed tobring down companies it targeted, IBM has been known to  train its guns onirksome individual entrepreneurs.andM;SewersandM;Among the most obnoxious is Steve Jobs, who paid tens of thousands of dollarsto television stations just so Apple could make fun of IBM customers, whom helikened to androids.andP;  Jobs was ultimately wounded by a soda popgun and wenton to greener pastures.andP;  In the end, IBM gave Jobs a sum that might be asmuch as Jobs paid the TV networks...andP;  just in case his NeXT software is worthimitating, even if it hasn't sold any machines.andP;  Need we investigate theimpact on Amdahl of ESA, PR/SM and not quite as many versions of the 3090 asthere are psychics in touch with Elvis? Now, Sun, Hewlett-Packard and theUnix flock are in IBM's sights.andP;  Duck, everyone! Perhaps we might bettertemper our sense of justice - or preserve the unfairness we were used tobefore the voice of the people, or the turtle, was heard in Albany.andP;  Thetortoise myth might have some value, particularly if it is upheld by law anda ban on giving the little buggers handguns.andP;  Admitting the fable is a fibcould lead to trouble.andP;  If things go far enough, millions of pet storeturtles might rise from the nation's sewers and try to flush our kids away.andO;And IBM could fire a shell powerful enough to circumnavigate the globe andpepper its own back with buckshot.andP;  It might already have done so with itsRS/6000s.andP;  After all, the initial reaction to the RISC machines is the bestIBM has gotten since it unveiled the AS/400 line.andP;  By the way, what everhappened to the AS/400?
