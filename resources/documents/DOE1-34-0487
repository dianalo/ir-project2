Scanning parameters (KV,MA) werekept constant, and the authors used a specially designed head holderto ensure a uniform scanning angle. Standard 8mm thick cuts, at zerodegrees to the supra-orbito-meatal line, were taken through the entirebrain. A &quot;phantom&quot; consisting of plastics of several different attenuationvalues was scanned before each patient as a reference to correct forany numerical drift in the scanner. Both patients and controls were scannedduring the same sessions to eliminate possible systematic bias, and asingle CT technologist carried out all scanning. Numerical CT data werecollected on magnetic tape for analysis on a specially designed imageprocessing system. Software was used to read CT density data from the512x512 matrix scanner output tapes and to transfer the resulting imagein standardized format to hard disk on the processing system. This systemconsists of a PDP-11-34 computer, linked to a Gould DeAnza IP-5000 imageprocessors, hard disk system and tape drive. Once transferred to disk,images were rated blindly to subject identity or diagnosis by another2 separate raters using a computer-linked cursor, and digitizer tablet.These numerical attenuation data from various anatomically defined regionsof interest, (ROI's), were then corrected for head size using a regressionmodel.</TEXT></DOC>
