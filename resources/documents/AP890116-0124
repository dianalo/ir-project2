Officials would notsay who may have sent it.   Foreign Office minister William Waldegrave returned from ameeting with Yasser Arafat in Tunis and said the PalestineLiberation Organization should be given a chance to prove itspeaceful intentions.   Relations between Britain and Israel are under strain becauseIsrael rejects British suggestions for a new moderate approach tothe PLO since Arafat, the PLO's chairman, publicly renouncedterrorism last month.   The embassy press office said: ``The parcel contained explosivesand was addressed to the ambassador, Yoav Biran.''   Police were called to the mission in Kensington Palace Gardens,west London, after a ``small device'' was received there in themail, Scotland Yard reported, but it did not give further details.It did not say where the bomb was defused.   Such attempts on Israeli diplomats in London have been rare inthe 1980s.   In June 1982, Ambassador Shlomo Argov was shot and wounded as heleft a dinner at a London hotel. Three Arabs of the terrorist groupled by Abu Nidal were convicted sentenced to prison.   Israel criticized Waldegrave's meeting Friday with Arafat, thefirst between Britain and the PLO at such a high level. He is tovisit Israel next month.   After his return Monday, Waldegrave said the PLO has said itwants to lay down its arms and form a democratic civilian state,``and now surely we should give them the chance to prove that whatthey say is sincere.''   He said it was vital to calm the ``totally understandableanxieties'' of the Israelis and assure them ``nobody is going todesert or leave them in the lurch.''   No attacks on Israeli targets by Palestinian groups underArafat's control have been reported since the Palestine NationalCongress, which acts as the PLO legislature, issued a Palestiniandeclaration of independence Nov. 15 that included implicitrecognition of Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
