Carlucci said Sunday.   ``Our position is that we welcome this dialogue (between theSoviet Union and China). ... It would be healthy for world peaceand stability,'' Carlucci told the Young Presidents' Organization,meeting in this British colony.   Carlucci said America's relationship with China is ``solid''even if China develops closer relations with the Soviet Union.   In recent years, China and the Soviet Union have tried toimprove their relations after an era of estrangement over politicaland ideological differences.   Carlucci arrived in Hong Kong on Saturday from China, where hemet Deng Xiaoping and other leaders. He left for Washington afteraddressing the Young Presidents' Organization, a private educationand service group based in New York whose 6,000 members becamepresidents of their companies before they were 40.   Carlucci said that in his Beijing talks, it was ``fascinating tosee the confluence of interests'' between China and the UnitedStates on Afghanistan, Cambodia and other international issues.   On Friday in Washington, the U.S. government announced it wouldapprove export licenses for satellites manufactured by the U.S.Hughes Aircraft Co. to be launched by China with its Long Marchrocket.   Private U.S. companies trying to establish satellite launchingservices have said they could be priced out of the internationalmarket by China's government-supported launching service.   Carlucci said the Chinese launch prices are about half the costof those in the United States, but he did not specify amounts.   He said he and Chinese Premier Li Peng had discussed the impactof the Chinese launches on the U.S. defense industry and thepossibility of China adjusting the price and number of its launches.</TEXT></DOC>
