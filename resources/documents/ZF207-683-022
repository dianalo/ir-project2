LagunaHills, Calif.andM;FBI Fails to Allay Concern for Civil LibertiesandM;In his letter that appeared in GCN Aug. 7, FBI spokesman Milt Ahlerich writesthat the bureau has the civil liberties problems of the NCIC 2000 projectwell under control.andM;While the FBI's words of support for civil liberties are welcome, Mr.andO;Ahlerich's assurances are premature.andM;Computer experts who participated in an extensive review of the FBI'sredesign of the National Crime Information Center found the proposal deeplyflawed.andP;  Long-standing problems with data quality were inadequatelyaddressed, as was the need for systematic procedures to remove inaccurate oroutdated information.andM;The plan still lacks a clear security model that sets out possible threats tothe system and proposed countermeasures.andM;And the proposed mechanism to authenticate the identity of the system usersis simply inadequate.andP;  Left unresolved, these problems increase thelikelihood of vulnerability and make the necessary security functionsimpossible to implement in any meaningful way.andM;Mr.andP;  Ahlerich writes that &quot;from the drawing board through implementation, theFBI's primary concern has been civil liberties, privacy and accuracy ofdata.&quot;andP;  However, the original list of design proposals included tracking ofsuspects and links to records systems at the Internal Revenue Service, theSocial Security Administration, the Immigration and Naturalization Service,and even credit bureaus, insurance companies and phone companies.andP;  It wasdrawn up without any input at all from civil liberties or privacy experts.andM;At the request of Rep.andP;  Don Edwards (D-Calif.), the FBI contacted privacyexperts to assess the proposed changes.andP;  Without Edwards' oversight and anindependent review of the project by Computer Professionals for SocialResponsibility and other experts, many of the original proposals may havegone forward.andM;Mr.andP;  Ahlerich claims that the FBI's plans for digitized mug shots also servecivil liberties interests.andP;  Yet the digitized storage and transmission of mugshots is a major step toward the computerized matching of photographs, acapability of uncertain reliability and obvious dangers.andP;  (Consider how thewidespread use of photograph surveillance contributed to the efficiency ofthe recent crackdown in China.)andM;On-line fingerprint searching and DNA identification, two other FBIinitiatives, also could have a profound impact on the ability of governmentto monitor the activities of individuals from all walks of life.andM;The computerization of criminal justice information raises significantsecurity and civil liberties problems.andP;  The FBI has failed to allay theseconcerns.andP;  Marc Rotenberg Director, Washington Office Computer Professionalsfor Social Responsibility Washington, D.C.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
