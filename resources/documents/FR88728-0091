Necessity of Data CollectionThe Office of Regulatory Analysis of the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration (OSHA) is collecting data to support an assessment of thetechnological and economic feasibility of revising its standard on theuse of personal protective equipment (PPE). OSHA has selected a telephonesurvey as the most effective means of generating the data needed to supportthis regulatory effort. The same data collection effort will also be usedto assess the methods of compliance required by future revisions to OSHAstandards covering welding operations, the pulp and paper industry, andrespirator usage. Finally, OSHA will create a data base on the engineeringcontrol methods that are used in lieu of personal protective equipment.This information can be used to influence OSHA's consideration of the personalprotective equipment standard and several other rulemakings as may be appropriate.Thus, OSHA is creating a survey-based data set for use in three scheduledregulatory analyses and in other future regulatory efforts. The existing personal protective equipment standards apply to all of generalindustry (29 CFR Part 1910). Many of these standards are outdated or designrestrictive and must be supplemented by administrative actions to permitthe use of more recently developed PPE. Such PPE, while technically notin compliance with the existing standard, provides equivalent or betterprotection than PPE of the type mandated by the existing standard. The proposed standard would revise the PPE requirements to make them clearer,more comprehensive, and more consistent with current technology. The revisedstandard will update all incorporations by reference to national consensusstandards so as to reference the most current American National Standards(ANSI) for the design of eye, face, foot, and head protection. Requirementsfor the selection, care, and use of PPE, and for training in use of PPEare to be included in the proposed standard. The revised standard willalso provide a redrafting of key elements of the standard to clarify thecompliance requirements for employers and to make these requirements applyto all workers. The OSHA standards for welding include numerous requirements for personalprotective equipment. OSHA will use this survey to generate informationrelevant to the effort to revise these standards. The focus and coverageof the PPE and welding standards are so similar that much of the informationcollected will serve both efforts. OSHA has also added several questionsto generate hard-to-obtain data about the types of welding operations occurringand about current practices in several areas covered by the existing andrevised versions of the standards. OSHA is also contemplating revisions to its standard for pulp and paperoperations. In this area, OSHA will be seeking information on selectedaspects of pulp, paper, and paperboard mills as well as on PPE use. Thisinformation will be sought solely from the pulp and paper industry in conjunctionwith the larger survey effort. OSHA's Congressional mandate stipulates that the agency carefully designand study its regulatory proposals. Section 6(b)(5) of the OSHA Act 2dU.S.C. 655 (b)(5) mandates that regulations promulgated by the Agency shallmost adequately assure worker safety and health ``to the extent feasibleon the basis of the best available evidence.'' They are to be based on``research and the latest available scientific data.'' Section 6(f) ofthe Act requires regulations to be justified by ``substantial evidencein the record'' and authorizes the Secretary of Labor ``to enter into contracts,agreements or other arrangements with appropriate public agencies or privateorganizations for the purposes of conducting studies related to his responsibilityunder the Act.'' The courts have endorsed the view that technological andeconomic factors affect the feasibility of proposed regulations. Thus,OSHA is obligated to gather data on the technological feasibility, costof compliance, and economic consequences of future standards. Executive Order 12291 reiterates this obligation by requiring the preparationof preliminary and final Regulatory Impact Analyses for each major rule.The Agency must analyze the potential benefits and costs of the rule andalternative approaches. The Regulatory Impact Analysis may be combinedwith the analysis required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act. This Actspecifically requires an analysis that describes the ``impact of the proposedrule on small entities'' and significant regulatory alternatives that ``takeinto account the resources available to small entities.''In order to fulfill the Congressional and Presidential mandates and toevaluate the economic and technological feasibility of the proposed OSHAstandards, OSHA requires a data base that describes current industry practicesand identifies situations where potential hazards exist. As discussed below,none of the available data sources are adequate for this purpose.For developing a data base relevant to the PPE standard, OSHA will requiredata on the use of PPE and on the work environments in which PPE use isessential to safety or health. Engineering controls, work practices, andthe nature of the manufacturing process determine, to a large extent, hazardlevels. Job hazards are also influenced by the efficacy of a firm's safetyprogram, including its policy on use of PPE. A sound policy requires anaccurate assessment of the hazards faced by workers, the provision of trainingto workers in hazard awareness, the institution of safe work practices,and the enforcement of proper PPE use.In meeting this objective, OSHA has designed the survey so that it willform the initial component of a major data base describing employee workconditions and job hazards. Because the survey instrument is organizedaround industrial processes, findings on job hazards can be placed withinthe context of specific industries and specific locations in the plant.The data base is also designed to allow numerous cross tabulations betweenrates of PPE use, and data on safety programs, injuries, and process hazards.This capability will be unique for data bases on industrial safety.This data collection effort is designed, therefore, to produce quantitativeestimates of (1) the number of workers who are exposed to hazards thatdictate the use of PPE, (2) the number of the workers who wear PPE, and(3) the effectiveness of PPE use. These hazards will be identified andclassified according to the type of manufacturing process and in recognitionof the nature of the engineering controls in place. Specific data on thehazards, the presence of engineering controls, and the associated PPE usewill permit a complete examination on the context of industrial decision-makingon PPE use. These data will also be used to identify areas where firmsare not adequately providing (or requiring) PPE and areas where safetytraining may be incomplete or missing.Injury and illness data are the final part of the necessary informationon work environments. OSHA will complete this survey of the work environmentby requesting firms to submit copies of OSHA Forms 101 and 200 which summarizethe establishment's injury and illness incidents. This data will be correlatedwith survey results in order to determine the relationships between safetypractices, engineering controls and use of PPE with success in preventinginjuries and illnesses. The information source will also provide statisticaldata on the measures being used by firms that are successful in maintaininglow injury rates.In order to take full advantage of this data collection opportunity, thesurvey will collect additional information on welding operations and onthe pulp and paper industry. These data will address hazards, work practices,and safety policies unique to these operations. For welding operations,information will be collected regarding specific protective clothing forwelders; respirator use, training, and maintenance; PPE use by welders'helpers; health monitoring; and other items. Data collected specificallyfrom the pulp and paper industry will address work practices for the handlingand storage of pulpwood and pulp chips; hazard training and the appropriateuse of protective eyewear, lifelines, respirators and other types of PPEin chemical pulpmaking operations; and training and safety procedures forthe operation and maintenance of chlorine dioxide systems used in bleachingoperations. Process-specific information regarding the presence of ventilationsystems and other types of engineering controls will be used to assessthe extent to which firms in the pulp and paper industry to rely on PPErather than on engineering controls for hazard protection.The data on engineering controls collected from all respondents will alsobe used as part of a continuing analysis of the appropriate methods ofcompliance with standards for welding, pulp and paper, and respirator useand with standards for other types of personal protective equipment. A timetable for the survey and the associated Regulatory Impact Analysisis presented on the next page. The timetable indicates that OSHA is attemptingto complete this project and survey within a short period of time. Theschedule currently calls for completion of the bulk of the survey effortwithin a 10-week period. Therefore, we request that an expedited reviewbe performed by OMB.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Schedule for Survey Design and Completion</T4><H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Complete design of survey instrument and submit information collectionplan to OMB <D>July 14, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Publish in <T4>Federal Register</T4> a notice of survey submission to OMB and thesurvey instrument <D>July 14-21, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Obtain survey and mailing list from DOL, and other list suppliers <D> July 15, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Receive OMB approval of survey and survey instrument <D>Aug. 15, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mail notification letters to survey targets <D>  Do.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Begin telephone interviewing <D>Aug. 20, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Complete first half of telephone interviewing <D>Sept. 20, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Submit Interim Report on secondary data base (covering industry database, regulatory comparison, and preliminary benefit analysis) <D>Aug. 26, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Complete second half of telephone interviewing <D>Oct. 21, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Perform any additional data tabulations and integrate survey resultsinto report <D>Nov. 4, 1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Submit draft final report <D>Nov. 15,1988.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Respond to comments and submit final report <D>Dec. 16, 1988.</D></ITAG></ITAG>2. Use of the InformationThe data collected through this effort will be used by OSHA (and its contractors)to perform technological and economic analyses related to the requiredRegulatory Impact Analyses and Regulatory Flexibility Analyses for proposedregulations modifying the Subpart I standards covering Personal ProtectiveEquipment as well as for future revisions to the Welding and Pulp and Paperstandards. The data will also be used in the study of compliance methodsappropriate for meeting the requirements of the welding, pulp and paper,and respirator standards.The OSHA Office of Regulatory Analysis will also be sharing data collectedin its research efforts with the Office of Safety Standards, which is draftingthe regulations. In this case, the data may be used to develop revisionsto any of the three regulatory proposals under consideration.For the standard governing personal protective equipment, the survey willprovide information on current compliance rates by industry. In addition,a database will be created that will permit analyses of the interrelationshipsamong process-related hazards, PPE use, and safety training and programs.The additional information on injury and illnesses, as provided by companieswho submit their OSHA Form 101s and 200s, will add another dimension tothe possible analyses of these data.For the welding study, the survey will yield difficult-to-obtain data onwelding work practices, safety procedures, and training. This data willsupport estimates of compliance with existing and proposed OSHA standardsand provide the database necessary for estimation of compliance costs.For the pulp and paper industry, the survey will facilitate the analysisof safety procedures and work practices in several industry-specific processes.This information is not available from other sources.In the absence of the data generated by this survey, OSHA could not accuratelymeasure the impacts of the existing and proposed PPE standards. In particular,OSHA could only speculate about the extent to which PPE is effectivelyused in different industrial settings.The discussion below describes the data uses for responses to each setof questions in the survey instrument.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Introduction and Collection of Identification Data</ITAG>The first elements of the survey instrument describe the telephone surveyin general and determine whether the respondent is in the SIC code anticipatedby the survey design. If the respondent is not in the SIC code expected(as based on Dun and Bradstreet industry lists), the correct SIC will begathered. If the SIC is one that is to be covered in the survey, the interviewerwill continue the questioning.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Data Collection on Types of Activities and Employment</ITAG>The next questions specify the type of activities (e.g., manufacturing,administrative, services, etc.) performed in the facility. Several purposesare served. First, establishments that perform solely administrative servicesare to be excluded from the remainder of the questionnaire. Second, thenumber of employees in production and other categories will be determined.This information will be used in later segments of the questionnaire. Finally,the data on total employment will be used in consistency checks made inthe final statistical analyses.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Questions on Welding Practices</ITAG>The interviewer will ask respondents if they perform welding operationsin their facilities. If so, a series of questions are asked about the meansfor protecting welders and welders' helpers against the hazards posed bywelding operations. The questions review both the use of PPE by weldersand the use of engineering controls, such as curtains and screens and ventilationsystems, as protection systems. Additional questions determine whetherthe welding is performed in the context of production or maintenance andrepair work. This information will be useful for the regulatory impactanalysis.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Questions on Pulp and Paper Mill Operations </ITAG>A separate set of questions is asked only of respondents in the pulp andpaper industry (SIC 26). These questions will examine the use of lifelines,personal flotation devices, and other types of PPE in specific pulp andpaper operations. Additional questions cover training and safety proceduresin chemical pulpmaking and bleaching operations. This information willsupplement data obtained from questions about process-specific PPE useand engineering controls as described below. These data will be directlyrelevant to the determination of the extent of compliance with the existingand proposed pulp and paper standard. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Identification of Processes Employed </ITAG>The next section will identify the processes employed in the facility.The interviewer will prompt the respondent with 2 or 3 processes that arebelieved to be performed in the facility. The respondent will then be askedfor other processes used in the facility. The interviewer will code inthese additional responses by referring to a master list of processes.If the process does not appear on the list, it will be coded in manually.<ITAG tagnum="81">F. Identification of Engineering Controls Used </ITAG>For each process, a set of questions will determine the types of engineeringcontrols that may be employed at the facility. The interviewer will referto a master list that associates processes with its associated hazards.This master list will be prepared in advance of the telephone interviewingthrough an extensive review of process safety and health information. Thehazards are categorized into seven categories: eye and face (flying particlesand chips), head, feet, hands, respiratory, noise, and skin (chemical absorption,splash). Thus, for example, for process X, the interviewer will refer tothe list to determine if hazards to the eye and face are associated withthe process. He will code this information into the computer. The computer-basedquestionnaire (see Section A.3) will then skip to the appropriate engineeringcontrols that might be employed to reduce or eliminate worker hazards fromthe process. For eye and face hazards, for example, the possible engineeringcontrols include various screens, barriers or enclosures to separate theworker from any flying chips or particles emanating from machinery usedin the process. <ITAG tagnum="81">G. Identification of Personal Protective Equipment Used </ITAG>After the engineering controls are identified, questions are asked aboutthe types of PPE used by workers engaged in that process. Proceeding withthe example given above, the respondent will be asked if workers wear eyeand/or face protection while working at the process being discussed. Ifsuitable engineering controls are not in place and items of PPE are notbeing used, then the firm will be considered to have hazards requiringPPE use for purpose of determining current industry practice in the analysis.This will not be communicated in any way to OSHA field compliance staffas explained later in the confidentiality section. <ITAG tagnum="81">H. Questions on Establishment-wide Training and Use of PPE</ITAG>The next section will solicit information on the establishment's policiesregarding training of workers in PPE use and hazard identification. Thetraining requirements are explicit in the draft standard. An additionalquestion asks whether the company has assessed the hazards evident in itsfacility. Again, this step is required by the draft standard. Finally,the interviewer will ask how many persons in the entire facility wear eachtype of PPE. (OSHA expects that not all production employees will be includedin the totals associated with the processes, or that, some double-countingof employees is possible. This question is the only means of developingan overall estimate of the number of employees wearing PPE). <ITAG tagnum="81">I. Final Questions on Specific Policies for use and Handling of PPE</ITAG>Several elements in the draft standard require policies regarding the useof employee-provided PPE, reissuing and cleaning of PPE, and replacementof damaged PPE. In order to determine compliance with these items, thesequestions are included at the end of the interview. <ITAG tagnum="81">J. Request for Mail Submission of the OSHA Forms 101 and 200</ITAG>Those respondents reporting recordable occupational injuries in the lasttwo years will be asked to supply copies of their Form 101s and 200s. OSHAwill correlate the facility PPE use and PPE policies with facility accidenthistories. 3. Use of Technology to Reduce Burden Information for this survey will be collected using a Computer AssistedTelephone Interviewing (CATI) system. Such a procedure will improve thequality and efficiency of the survey in a number of ways and will alsoreduce respondent burden. First, since the survey is done via telephone,there is no need for scheduling on-site visits to gather the information.This is expected to both increase the reponse rate and reduce the costand time of completing interviews. Respondents are also not being askedto fill out a long questionnaire form on their operations. Further, CATI system responses are entered directly into the computer,eliminating the need for separate recording and coding operations. Also,the computer ensures that the proper sequence of questions is followedautomatically. For example, if the response to one question suggests thata follow-up question can be skipped, the computer will automatically moveon. The interviewer simply reads the questions as they appear on the screen.This system produces a smoothly flowing interview and eliminates any pausesor delays by the interviewer to enter responses by hand or to find thenext question. 4. Identification and Duplication of InformationSignificant effort has been expended in collecting and examining existingsources of information relating to the patterns of use of personal protectiveequipment in various industries. This has been used to determine processesand hazards by industry to reduce the number of questions asked of eachrespondent. In addition to checking for possible information duplication,the assembled body of research was useful in helping to formulate and refinethe actual survey instrument.The following databases were reviewed in the course of designing the survey.Acronyms or abbreviations for these databses are indicated and are usedin the remainder of this document. A brief description of this informationand its relevance to the present effort is provided. A discussion of theshortcomings of these information sources for the analysis of PPE usagerequired for this study is presented in section 5 below.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. OSHA'S Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) Database</ITAG>OSHA's Integrated Management Information System (IMIS) contains data relatedto OSHA inspections for safety and health violations and in response toaccidents involving serious injuries and fatalities. This data source canbe used, on an industry basis, to obtain the frequency with which firmsare cited for PPE-related violations. As explained in Section 5, however,this citation rate is likely to understate the actual level of noncompliance.The data also do not allow any analysis of the number of workers in a givenfacility who were not wearing suitable PPE. Thus, there is no indicationof the degree to which a company may be out of compliance.The IMIS accident data provides information on the nature and the causeof the injury. This data will be used in assessing the benefits of theproposed revisions to the standard. Specifically, the accident narrativesthat are available for fatal incidents are helpful in determining the preventabilityof relevant accidents. The IMIS data base includes the OSHA Fatality/Catastrophereports that have been prepared over the past four years. The OSHA Fatality/Catastrophereports are based on investigations of fata accidents and of incidentsin which five or more workers are seriously injured. Many of the injuriesrelevant to PPE, however, are not investigated by OSHA and, therefore,would not be included in the IMIS data base.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Supplementary Data System (SDS)</ITAG>The SDS is a Federal-State cooperative program which complies informationfrom State workers' compensation records. Information is available concerningthe major characteristics of injuries and illnesses in various industriesand occupational groups. This data is being used to pinpoint industriesand occupations that generate injuries most likely to be preventable throughPPE usage. It is also potentially helpful in estimating the total nationalbaseline of injuries and illnesses that may be influenced by compliancewith regulations for use of PPE. The SDS data itself, however, containsno information on protective equipment worn by injured workers or on thepotentially hazardous conditions which might have contributed to the accident.Furthermore, it can do no more than outline the national baseline injurytotal because of the absence of any narratives or other means to describemore clearly the accidents covered in the data.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. National Occupational Exposure Survey (NOES)</ITAG>This two-year effort directed by the National Institute for OccupationalSafety and Health (NIOSH) involved visits to some 4,500 businesses representativeof the establishments covered by the 1970 Occupational Safety and HealthAct. Company officials were interviewed regarding the types of health andsafety programs in effect, and a plant walk-through was conducted in orderto document the numbers of workers exposed to various substances, and thecontrol methods in use.The focus of the NOES survey is almost entirely on health as opposed tosafety standards. The survey provides data on respirators, hearing protection,protective clothing and eye and face protection in the context of observedexposure to hazardous chemicals and materials. Data on the use of weldinghelmets were also collected. The use of safety glasses, face shields, hardhats, safety shoes, and protective clothing (e.g. fire retardant clothing)when used for safety-related reasons (protection against accidential ortraumatic situations) were not recorded. Furthermore, an exposure to hazardousmaterials of greater than 30 minutes per week was required in order forthe exposure and associated PPE control to be recorded. The NOES surveyalso includes data on the presence of ventilation systems as a controlfor hazardous exposures, as well as other means of control such as isolation,enclosure, and various work practice techniques to limit or avoid exposure.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. OSHA Survey on Permissible Exposure Levels (PEL)</ITAG>This telephone survey of 5,000 establishments will support OSHA's genericrulemaking on the control of occupational exposure to hazardous substances.The survey is designed to collect information on the chemical exposurepatterns or workers involved in a wide range of industrial processes. Dataon the wearing of PPE was collected for those processes which involvedchemicals.Because of the great variety of potential chemical exposures in industry,the PEL survey is necessarily limited to data collection on health as opposedto safety hazards. The PEL survey will provide data regarding employeeexposure to specific hazardous chemicals and the associated use of respiratorsand protective clothing, gloves, and eye and face protection. Informationon ventilation systems is also being collected. For the PEL survey, exposureis viewed in terms of inhalation or absorption and is measured in termsof atmospheric concentrations. Acute hazards such as chemical splash are,therefore, not directly addressed. The PEL survey covers most of the manufacturing sector and a number ofnon-manufacturing industries. The data are collected in the context ofa set of predetermined industry-specific processes or operations. Theseprocesses are general in nature and are not technology or equipment-based.No information is collected about safety-related PPE use, nor is any informationabout training, safety policies, or injury experience generated. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Department of Labor (DOL) Studies at the University of West Virginia</ITAG>A series of investigations conducted by researchers at the University ofWest Virginia examined current practices in the use of personal protectiveequipment among workers in several occupations and industries. These studiescover injuries and PPE needs and practices for specific occupations infoundries, chemical manufacturing facilities, and petroleum refineries.In addition, injuries and associated PPE practices for welders and workersfacing risks of episodic releases of toxic chemicals were investigated.Despite their limited scope, these studies provide important insights intoPPE practices and requirements for specific occupational situations. Thenumber of establishments surveyed, however, was small, and no statisticalvalidity can be attached to the results. The data was useful, however,in refining the questions included in the survey instrument. <ITAG tagnum="81">F. OSHA's Survey on Respirator Use </ITAG>In a 1984 study, OSHA conducted a telephone survey of approximately 2000manufacturing establishments to obtain information on the patterns of routine,occasional, and emergency respirator use. This information included dataon the types of respirators in use, the numbers of employees included inrespirator programs, and other information regarding training, monitoring,and inspection. Specific information on the types of airborne contaminantsencountered in the respondent's facilities was not collected. This survey was based on a two-stage sampling procedure. An initial sampleof about 7000 establishments was administered a screening survey to identifythose which used respirators. Those establishments with respirator programswere then eligible for the main in-depth survey. Thus, only informationon employment size (collected in the screening survey) is available asa control to analyze differences between establishments with and withoutrespirator programs. The OSHA survey was also restricted to the manufacturingsector. Thus, no information on respirator use was collected for non-manufacturingindustries. <ITAG tagnum="81">G. Bureau of Labor Statistics' Work Injury Reports </ITAG>The Bureau of Labor Statistics has conducted a number of surveys of injuredworkers. These surveys cover several categories applicable to use of PPEincluding head, eye, face, and foot injuries, chemical burns, welding-relatedinjuries, and others. The studies provide information on the extent towhich injured workers wear appropriate protective equipment, the PPE policiesof their employers, and the nature of any safety training they might havereceived. These data provide important insights into the relationshipsbetween injuries and PPE usage. Additional analysis of this informationis planned, particularly 3-way tabulations to control for safety trainingand policies in evaluating rates of PPE use among injured workers. The data in the Work Injury Reports, however, cannot be used to developcompliance rates because only injured workers are surveyed. Estimates ofPPE general usage, for example, would be biased downward since workersnot wearing PPE are more likely to be injured and thus included in thesurvey. <ITAG tagnum="81">H. Occupational Hazards Magazine Readership surveys </ITAG>Occupational Hazards, a magazine for safety professionals, conducts periodic``electronic'' surveys in which respondents voluntarily telephone in theirresponses. Recent surveys have generated 400-600 responses. Among the relevanttopics which have been covered are: Types of equipment used by employees;hazards against which PPE is used; employer contributions towards PPE purchase;and per employee spending on PPE. The results of the survey are interesting,but their statistical validity is limited by the significant influenceof self-selection in the responses, i.e., only companies with safety managersand established safety programs are likely to be participating in the survey.<ITAG tagnum="81">I. Current Industrial Reports   </ITAG>The Bureau of the Census collects and periodically publishes data on thevalue and quantities of shipments for a variety of industrial products.Such data from Current Industrial Reports on shipments of PPE might beused to estimate overall rates of use. The level of aggregation of thisdata, however, precludes identification of shipments totals for specificPPE types. <ITAG tagnum="81"/>J. NIOSH's National Traumatic Occupational Fatality Data BaseThe National Traumatic Occupational Fatality (NTOF) data base is beingdeveloped by NIOSH to provide a national census of traumatic occupationalfatalities. NIOSH is collecting death certificate records from all 50 statesand from the District of Columbia. These records are being used to estimatethe total occupational fatalities resulting from ``injury at work'', asentered on the death certificates. Information in the NTOF data base includethe age, sex, occupation and industry of employment of the victim, as wellas a description of the injury and immediate cause of death. NIOSH hascollected death certificates for the period 1980 through 1985 and plansto continue the collection through 1990. NTOF data provide a valuable base line for determining occupational fatalityrates. For the purposes of this project, however, the accident casualityinformation contained in the death certificates will not be sufficientlydetailed or consistent to permit determinations of the extent to whichPPE practices would have been relevant in preventing fatalities. The extentof the narrative description is quite variable, and often will not providemore than a brief phrase describing the incident. Also, information isnot generally available on whether the individual was wearing personalprotective equipment. Further, the lack of consistency in reporting precludesaccurate identification of the industry in which the victim was employedbelow the major division level of industry classification (e.g. construction,manufacturing, etc.). In summary, the uneven reporting of the circumstancesof accidents would preclude this data source from providing the informationneeded in this study. <T3>5. Inadequacy of Existing Data Sources </T3>The above databases provide valuable information on various aspects ofPPE-related questions and were utilized in design of this survey. Noneof them, individually or in combination, provide the comprehensive bodyof information about PPE required by OSHA. The inadequacies of these datasources are described below. <ITAG tagnum="81"/>A. Statistical Surveys (NOES, PEL, and Respirator Surveys) All of these studies provide statistical estimates of various types ofPPE use. These studies, however, have limited their focus to PPE used incontrolling health hazards. Specifically, none of these surveys providestatistically valid estimates of the number of workers who wear hard hats,safety glasses, face shields, safety shoes, and other types of PPE forsafety reasons. Both the PEL and NOES surveys collected data on the useof respirators and other PPE, primarily in response to exposure to airbornehazardous substances. Neither of these studies, however, provide informationabout the relationships between PPE use, training, safety programs, andindustrial injuries. Similarly, the OSHA respirator survey does not providestatistically-significant data for each industry. This survey also doesnot address factors that might influence establishment-level policies onPPE usage and did not collect data on the number of employees who use mosttypes of PPE. <ITAG tagnum="81"/>B. IMIS Data OSHA data on violations contained in IMIS indicate the frequency with whichinspected firms are cited for PPE violations. The format of the regulationsmakes it impossible in many cases to identify the exact nature of the violation.There are also biases in that very small firms are not likely to be inspectedby OSHA personnel, the most hazardous industries are targeted for inspections,and enforcement priorities may influence the pattern of citations in anunmeasurable fashion. Also, the citation statistics do not report who manyemployees failed to wear appropriate PPE. As noted above, accident datacontained in the IMIS are biased because only fatalities or accidents with5 or more serious injuries are typically investigated. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Injury Data (SDS, Work Injury Reports</ITAG>Information from worker compensation files contained in the BLS SDS datawill be useful in analyzing the causes of injuries potentially preventableby PPE use. Data on PPE use by injured workers, however, is not collected.Thus neither compliance rates nor the benefits of increased PPE use canbe derived from these data. Also, since the sample is not comprehensive,the SDS data can not be used directly to establish injury rates on an occupationalor industry basis. Data from the Work Injury Reports are useful for analysisof the conditions and characteristics of injured workers. Since only injuries(i.e., not fatalities) are included in the sample, limited insight is providedregarding overall patterns of PPE use.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Summary</ITAG>In summary, the available data do not provide adequate quantitative evidenceregarding the extent of PPE usage for safety-related reasons. Those studieswhich have compiled statistically-valid data on the use of PPE have limitedtheir focus to the PPE used in controlling health hazards. The studiesthat do address the safety-related uses of PPE are not designed for creatingstatistical measurements, are limited in scope, and do not provide sufficientdata to develop reliable estimates of the patterns of hazard exposure andassociated PPE requirements. None of the data reviewed for this submissioncan be used to produce estimates of the population of workers and establishmentsimpacted by the current and proposed PPE standard, the extent of compliance,or the costs of compliance. Similarly, these data do not reflect the currentindustry practice information that is needed for the regulatory impactanalyses for the revised welding and pulp and paper standards.Furthermore, none of the available information sources provide, on an industry-specificbasis, a comprehensive linkage between patterns of PPE use for both safetyand health reasons and the presence of engineering controls, the natureof the manufacturing process and technology, and associated work practices.Also, the interrelationship between accident experience, the use of PPE,and the nature of safety training and other safety programs is not addressedin these data sources. It is the lack of a comprehensive data base to evaluatethe full range of regulatory options needed to perform the Regulatory ImpactAnalysis that necessitates a field survey. The survey results will alsoassist OSHA in determining the need for these standards.6. Minimizing Burden on Small BusinessesThis data collection effort involves the collection of information fromlarge and small firms. Every effort has been made to minimize respondentburden. The survey instrument has been designed to allow the respondentsto provide estimates and approximations rather than detailed informationof the type which would lengthen response time. Respondent burden willbe limited by: (1) Limiting the length of the telephone interview to approximately45 minutes, (2) avoiding requests which require record of file review,and (3) accommodating respondents in arranging the most convenient timeto conduct the interview.In addition, the questionnaire is organized so that the response timesof small firms will be lower. The questionaire focuses on the specificprocesses employed in a facility. Many small firms will have only 1 or2 processes and will therefore require only 20 to 35 minutes to completethe questionaire.7. Recurrent Survey ConsequencesThis effort is a one-time, non-recurring survey. The consequences associatedwith less frequent collection are not applicable.8. Consistency with 5 CFR 1320.6There are no special circumstances that require the collection of informationin any manner inconsistent with the guidelines in 5 CFR 1320.6.9. Expert Review of the Survey QuestionnaireThe survey design team has had numerous discussion with industry experts,including safety engineers and safety program managers, in order to assessthe substance of the survey questions. The clarity of instructions andother specific survey design elements have been reviewed by contractorsurvey experts. OSHA personnel (both in ORA and Standards), and by expertsafety consultants in industry.<ITAG tagnum="15">A.

No major problems arose during this review.C. Public comment will be solicited through the <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice for the study.10. ConfidentialityProcedures have been developed to protect the confidentiality of the collecteddata. These measures are summarized below:A. All contractor and subcontractor personnel will be given instructionsregarding the importance of keeping all information they obtain from respondentsconfidential.B. The data will be collected using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interviewing(CATI) system. This technology enables the survey responses to be automaticallywritten to a computer data file. Neither the name of the company nor therespondent will appear in the data file. A listing of respondents willbe kept separately in a locked file cabinet at the contractor's office,and will be destroyed when no longer needed. The respondent's names willbe linked to the data base through a unique number assigned at the timeof the interview.C. OSHA Forms 101 and 200 will be assigned the respondent's record numberwhen received and then coded and entered into the computer file and matchedwith the respondent's survey data record. The OSHA forms will then be destroyed.Strict confidentiality will be maintained during the coding procedure.D. Diskettes containing completed survey data will be stored in lockedfile cabinets at the contractor's office. E. Publication of study results will be of a statistical nature only. Respondentswill never be identified in any publication or presentation, nor will theirnames be made available to other individuals or groups. 11. Sensitive Questions The proposed survey instrument contains no questions of a sensitive nature.12. Costs The total one-time cost to the government of the proposed data collectionis $485,000. This estimate includes costs incurred by contractors for administrationand operation of the data collection, tabulation of survey results, andsubsequent analyses (including benefit and cost estimates, small entityimpacts, economic impacts, etc.). The total one-time cost to industry isestimated to be $86,565 based on an administrative wage rate of $20.45per hour including fringe benefits. 13. Estimates of Burden This survey was not included in the agency's ICB as the potential scopeof the changes to the PPE standard as necessitated by newer technologiesand changes in current industry practices only became apparent as the projectprogressed. Every effort will be made to minimize respondent burden. All survey instrumentshave been designed to allow the respondent to provide estimates and approximations,rather than specific information for a specific time period. The effortwill focus on collecting information that respondents have already compiledor measured for their own purposes. Respondents are not expected to performnew data compilation activities. The completion time for each telephone survey will vary, depending uponhow much of the survey topic is applicable. It is estimated that a fullycompleted survey will require 45 minutes on average. Those declining toparticipate at the onset and those completing only the screening portionof the survey will require 5 minutes on average. The total respondent burden for the telephone survey will be approximately4,233 hours. The following table summarizes the burden for each group ofrespondents: <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,i1,s25,6,6,6,8 </C><T4> Respondent Burden Estimates </T4><H1>Type of respondent </H1><H1>Number of respondents </H1><H1>Average completion time (min.) </H1><H1>Total burden (hrs.) </H1><H1>Responder cost \1\ </H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Non-Response or screening only <D>3501 </D><D>5 </D><D>293 </D><D>$5,992 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Complete <D>5254 </D><D>45 </D><D>3940 </D><D>80,573 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Total <D>8755 </D><D> </D><D>4233 </D><D>$86,565 </D><F>\1\ Based on an administrative wage rate of $20.45 per hour includingfringes. </F></ITAG></ITAG> 14. Changes in Anticipated Burden This is a one-time data collection effort and thus it will not representa recurring paperwork burden to respondents. 15. Plans for Tabulation of the Data The survey data will be analyzed and used for the PPE, Welding, and Pulpand Paper standards to prepare Regulatory Impact Analyses (RIAs) and RegulatoryFlexibility Analyses which will be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The data will also support efforts to draftthe safety standards themselves, and efforts to develop more cost effectiveregulatory language. Tabulations of the primary data will be analyzed todevelop estimates pertinent to the development of these RIAs. These willinclude estimates of the number of firms that will incur compliance costs,and the number of employees by firm and by industry who are wearing orshould be wearing personal protective equipment. Additionally, estimateswill be derived of the number of employees who are trained in the correctuse of PPE and the number of companies who actively enforce the correctuse of PPE. In addition to specific estimates of the levels of compliancewith PPE requirements for welding and pulp and paper operations, tabulationsof other data specific to welding or pulp and paper operations will beused to support compliance estimates for those standards. The survey will also generate data on the use of PPE by process throughoutmanufacturing and in selected areas of non-manufacturing, and on the injuriesand illnesses associated with these processes (through collection of respondentsOSHA Form 101s and 200s). These data will help establish a data base onthe distribution of worker hazards among industries, and within industrialfacilities. The data will also be correlated with information gatheredin the survey on the training and safety programs of respondents. OSHAexpects to make numerous cross-tabulations to determine the relationshipsamong these various components of worker safety conditions. <ITAG tagnum="84">Statistical Methods Employed </ITAG>1. Description of the Respondent Universe and Sample Allocation The underlying universe for this survey design is all commercial establishmentsin the United States (excluding the construction industry) which are subjectto OSHA regulations for the use of personal protective equipment (PPE).Since the need for PPE differs by industry sector, a careful review ofStandard Industrial Classification (SIC) codes allowed OSHA to concentrateon only the SIC categories which are given in Table 1. Thus, the totalityof all establishments defined in Table 1 is the Respondent Population forthis survey. The subgroups shown in that exhibit are the key estimationcells for this study. Estimates for the population establishment counts, which are shown in Table2, were obtained from several sources. The population counts for the manufacturingsectors (SICs 20 through 39) were obtained from a Dun andamp; Bradstreetlisting of all such establishments. This file was purchased by OSHA inJune of 1987. Population counts for some of the service sectors (SICs 40and above) were derived from a Dun andamp; Bradstreet listing dated December,1987. This data base was purchased in support of the PEL survey recentlydone by the Office of Regulatory Analysis, and contained only those SICsectors included in that survey. For any SIC which was not in this file,estimates in Table 2 were obtained from the Bureau of Labor Statistics(BLS) Bulletin 2297, dated December, 1987. Population statistics are tabulatedby Estimation Cells and, within that, by size categories. Since the BLSBulletin 2297 did not contain a breakdown by size, no estimates for sizestrata are shown for those cells in which Dandamp;B data was not availablein Table 2. It is OSHA's plan to obtain new versions of both the manufacturing andnon-manufacturing sectors from Dun and Bradstreet just prior to commencementof the actual sample selection. At that time, the calculations done inthis package will be modified to account for the most recent information.We do not expect substantial changes in estimates for popular counts inTable 2 or in sample size estimates which appear later in this document.The size categories used are defined by the number of employees in establishments:<ITAG tagnum="15">(i) 0-19 employees</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(ii) 20-99 employees </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(iii) 100-249 employees, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">(iv) 250 and above employees. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,i1,6,8,r25 </C><T4>Table</T4> 1._<T4>Definition of Estimation Cells</T4> <H1>Cell No. </H1><H1>SIC codes included </H1><H1>Description </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">1 <D>20 </D><D>Food and Kindred Products. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>21 </D><D>Tobacco Products. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">2 <D>22 </D><D>Textile Mill Products. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">3 <D>23 </D><D>Apparel and Other Textile Products. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>31 </D><D>Leather and Leather Products. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">4 <D>26 </D><D>Paper and Allied Products. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">5 <D>24 </D><D>Lumber and Wood Products. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">6 <D>25 </D><D>Furniture and Fixtures. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">7 <D>27 </D><D>Printing and Publishing. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">8 <D>281 </D><D>Industrial Inorganic Chemicals. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>282 </D><D>Plastics Materials and Synthetics. </D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>286 </D><D>Industrial Organic Chemicals. </D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>287 </D><D>Agricultural Chemicals. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">9 <D>29 </D><D>Petroleum and Coal Products. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">10 <D>283 </D><D>Drugs. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>284 </D><D>Soap, Cleaners, and Toilet Goods. </D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>285 </D><D>Paints and Allied Products. </D><ITAG tagnum="22">  </ITAG><D>289 </D><D>Miscellaneous Chemical Products. </D><ITAG tagnum="1">11 <D>30 </D><D>Rubber and Misc.

Because of the complexity of the table given inAppendix 1, the sample allocation scheme aggregated to the Estimation Celllevel is shown separately in Table 3.2. Stratification and Sample Selection Estimates will be produced for the 29 estimation cells defined in Table1. For each estimation cell, a stratified systematic sample will be selected.Each cell will be stratified by four employment size classes. The size-classboundaries will be as follows: 0-19 employees, 20-99 employees. 100-249employees, and 250 or more employees. Within each estimation cell/size-class stratum, the establishments willbe sorted by four digit SIC before selection.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Required Sample Size</ITAG>Because of the complexity of the questionnaire for this survey and becauseof the requirement to produce estimates for many variables, no single surveyitem can be identified with which to set sample sizes. A common practicein such cases is to use two or more items from the survey which are differentwith respect to the form of the sample which would emerge if only thatitem was used to define the sample. Following this procedure, two variableswere chosen: The mean employment and the fraction of establishments incompliance with respect to PPE regulations. In fact, these represent groupsof estimates which will be produced. The first relates to variables whichare proportional to employment, such as the number of employees exposedto a hazard requiring PPE. The latter relates to the class of estimateswhich are proportions of establishments that share some characteristic(for example, those that require hard hats be worn for a particular process).In order to estimate sample sizes for the two types of variables definedin the previous paragraph, estimates of means and standard deviations forthe variables of interest must be obtained. In the case of the employmentvariable, means and standard deviations were obtained from the Dun andBradstreet frame. For the proportion variable, it was assumed that theproportion of interest is approximately 0.6. From this assumption, onecan compute the required standard deviation for use in the sample sizecomputation.In each case, a separate estimate of the required sample was made and thenallocated into the size-class strata using optimal allocation. Finally,the two estimates were averaged to produce the final estimate of samplesize. This procedure will result in a sample which is concentrated in thesmallest and the largest size strata. This is useful because of the needto adequately estimate the impact on small businesses and to also be efficientin the use of the sample.Both sample size estimates shown in Appendix 1 (that for variables proportionalto total employment and that for variables which are proportions of establishmentshaving some characteristic) were produced assuming the following accuracyrequirements: For manufacturing SICs (20-39), a target coefficient of variationof 5.5% was assumed and for the non-manufacturing SICs, a coefficient ofvariation of 7.5% was used. The coefficient of variation is the ratio ofthe standard error of the estimator to the mean of the estimator. Differentaccuracy requirements were set for the two groups because it was determinedat the outset of the survey design that there was likely to be a greaterdegree of variability among processes and PPE use in the manufacturingsector.<T3>a. Allocation to Size-Class Strata. </T3>For both of the variablesused to set the sample sizes and for each estimation cell, the sample allocationto the employment size-class strata is based on the theory of optimal allocation(Neyman allocation). For the employment variable, this procedure will allocatethe sample units based on the total number of population units in eachstratum and the population standard deviation of total employment in eachstratum. For the proportion of establishments having some characteristic,the sample is allocated in proportion to the number of establishments ineach stratum within the estimation cell. This latter situation followsfrom the fact that the sample size estimate for the proportion of interest(60%) and the associated standard deviation were used in all size classes.<T3>b. Frame Development and Sample Selection. </T3>The sampling framewill be developed from the Dun and Bradstreet listing of establishments.This frame was used by the Office of Regulatory Analysis for prior surveysand has proved to useful for establishment surveys. There is some concernthat the Dandamp;B listing overstates the non-manufacturing establishmentsin the universe. These and other possible problems with the frame can beremedied by using the results of the survey, for example to produce anestimate in total ``in scope'' establishments in the universe.At the time of sample selection, the frame will be sorted by EstimationCell by Size-class by four digit SIC by employment. Selection will be bysystematic sampling from a random start within each cell and size stratum.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Estimation</ITAG>Estimates will be produced for each estimation cell. All survey estimatorswill be self-weighting using weights attached to each respondent's recordin the database. Estimates from the survey are expected to have a relativestandard error in the range of .04 to .10 (see section B.2.3). Estimatesof totals will take the following form:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">Insert illus. 690</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where y<T2>ijk </T2>is the response of the kth unit in the jth stratum of estimationcell i, WGT is the stratum sampling weight, and NRAF is the stratum's unitnon-response adjustment factor for the parameter in question (defined below).Estimates of means will take the following form:<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus. 691A</ITAG>The Non-Response Adjustment Factor (NRAF) for the kth usable unit in stratumj of estimation cell i is calculated as follows:<G/><ITAG tagnum="91">Insert illus. 691B</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="92"/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Non-Response Adjustment Factor is calculated for each size-classstratum j in estimation cell i by summing the pre-coded employments forall viable sample units (all sample units less out the scope and out ofbusiness units) divided by the employment sum of all usable sample units.Note that the non-response adjustment procedure is a mean imputation.<T3>a. Benchmarking Estimates. </T3>To most efficiently use the Dandamp;Bsampling frame, estimates of key variables will be ``benchmarked'' to otherdata sources. For example, the estimate of ``total cost of coming intocompliance'' will be computed as follows:<G/><ITAG tagnum="7">Insert illus. 692</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">where the emp<T2>ijk </T2>is the number of employees obtained from the survey, c<T2>ijk </T2>is the cost amount associated with case k within cell i andsize stratum j, and (BLS Emp)<T2>i </T2>is the number of employees obtained from sources at the Bureauof Labor Statistics.<T3>b. Item Nonresponse. </T3>It is expected that some respondents whodo participate in the survey will either refuse to answer some questionsor not know the answer. In such cases it is common to impute responses.Imputation is done by using information obtained from the respondent onother questions and/or information from other like respondents to fillin the missing datum. There are many methods in common use for imputingfor missing data including mean imputation, hot deck procedures and regression-basedimputation.OSHA plans to use a mean imputation approach for missing items in thissurvey. First items which require imputation will be identified (for example,by virtue of their use in algorithms requiring multiple variables fromeach record). Second, specifications for how to impute will be made. Insome cases one can infer the answer to missing questions based upon answersto other questions. Failing that, a mean imputation will be done withinthe cell and size class for the record with missing datum. In such a case,the missing value is replaced by the arithmetic mean for those cases inthe cell/size stratum which have an answer for that value. The final stepis to carefully document which values were imputed and to retain both theoriginal and imputed values in the database. c. <T3>Variance Estimation. </T3>Since a survey is contemplated rather thana census of the establishments of interest, estimates produced from thesurvey database will have errors due to sampling alone. It is customaryto produce estimates of such errors, usually called standard errors ofthe estimate.  OSHA plans to use a replication technique to produce standard errors suchas half-sample replication. Such methods are preferred because of the complexityof determining exact formulas for survey data which include nonresponseadjustment factors as is the case with the proposed survey. Computationof such standard errors is routine with the use of computers. <ITAG tagnum="81">C. Accuracy </ITAG>The survey is desinged to produce estimates having relative standard errorsranging from .04 to .10 depending on the variable being estimated and theindustry sector in which it falls. A detailed tabulation of estimated standarderrors for the two types of estimates mentioned in section B.2.1 aboveis given in Appendix 2. It is emphasized, however, that estimates at the national level will bequite accurate (relative variances less than 1 percent). The approach tosample size selection outlined in this submission package is designed tomeet several goals. First, estimates of all variables at the national levelwill be very accurate. Second, as mentioned above, estimates at the estimationcell level will be moderately accurate (relvariances in the 4 percent to10 percent range). Moreover, the estimates at the estimation cell levelwill be consistent in their accuracy between cells. Finally, the samplewill be very useful for estimation in the smallest size category (1 to19 employees). This is important because of the requirement to analyzethe impact of the proposed regulations on small businesses. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Special Sampling Procedures </ITAG>None. <ITAG tagnum="81">E. Use of Periodic Sampling </ITAG>Not applicable. 3. Response Rates The survy is voluntary and is expected to yield a response rate in excessof 75 percent of in scope cases. Experience on prior surveys indicatesthat the Dun and Bradstreet frame has over 80 percent in scope cases (inbusiness, having working telephone numbers, etc.). The expected responserate of 75 percent mentioned above relates to the total of in scope caseson the frame. The CATI collection process should help to improve the overallresponse rate by allowing for direct telephone contact with the respondentand by scheduling and maintaining a detailed record of all necessary call-backs.Five attempts to reach a particular company will be required. Efforts willbe made to distinguish between those units that do not respond becausethey are ``out of business'' or otherwise ``out of scope'', and those thatare ``refusals''. 4. Tests of ProceduresOSHA proposes to condut up to 100 site visits (roughly 3 per estimationcell) to test the quality and reliability of the data being collected bythe telephone interviewing. A random selection of 2 respondents and 1 non-respondentper estimation cell will be used for this purpose. <ITAG tagnum="84">5.
