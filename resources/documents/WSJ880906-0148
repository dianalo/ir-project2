First Federal Savings Bank andamp; Trust, Pontiac, Mich., paid the Federal Savings andamp; Loan Insurance Corp. $500,000 for Citizens Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Jacksonville, Fla. Normally the FSLIC has to pay a healthy institution a premium to take a sick one off its hands.    First Federal also agreed to invest $4 million of capital in the Florida thrift, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board said.    The transaction was the second merger to be announced under a new, fast-track program launched by the Bank Board in June. Of the 20 thrifts offered in the first round of the so-called &quot;McDeal&quot; program, regulators have said they have potentially acceptable bids on at least 12 more.    First Federal has assets of $1.4 billion, 34 branches in Michigan and one loan-production office in Florida. Citizens Federal, a mutual institution, had five branches in Jacksonville with assets of $62.7 million and liabilities of $65.16 million. It will become Citizens Federal Savings Bank, a stock-owned institution.    In Jacksonville, James Clarkson, chairman and president of First Federal, said he is confident that Citizens Federal can recover more from its bad loans than its books suggest. He said he plans to have it open branches across the state and grow to $200 million in assets within two years.    Separately, Valley Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association of Hutchinson, Kan., was placed in the Bank Board's management-consignment program. Valley Federal, with $238.7 million in assets and $252.2 million in liabilities, has five branches. It is the sixth institution placed this year in the program, which the FSLIC uses to stabilize troubled thrifts while seeking long-term solutions for them. </TEXT></DOC>
