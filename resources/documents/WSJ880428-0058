Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> BON SCR </IN><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Milken, arguably the most powerful figure in U.S. finance, appeared before a congressional subcommittee but invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination rather than answer questions about Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s junk-bond operations.    Members of the House oversight and investigations subcommittee cautioned against drawing any adverse inferences from Mr. Milken's refusal to testify and said they weren't accusing him or Drexel of any crimes. But Mr. Milken, in explaining his refusal, repeatedly said, &quot;I've been under grand jury investigation in the Southern District of New York for the past 18 months.&quot;    The subcommittee hearings on Drexel, which continue today with testimony by its chief executive officer, Frederick Joseph, appear to be opening a new front in the investigations of the firm. Unlike the probes of the firm currently being conducted by the Manhattan U.S. attorney and the Securities and Exchange Commission, which have grown out of the Ivan Boesky insider-trading scandal, the congressional inquiry is questioning Drexel's marketing of high-yield, high-risk securities known as junk bonds and whether it has short-changed major clients to benefit its own executives.    As he entered the packed hearing room yesterday morning, the reclusive Mr. Milken, who appeared under a congressional subpoena, was immediately surrounded by photographers, television camera crews, and a courtroom artist. With noted lawyer Edward Bennett Williams at his side, Mr. Milken smiled wanly as flashbulbs popped continuously for almost half an hour before proceedings began. At the outset, Mr. Williams called on a rarely used congressional rule to successfully demand that the room be cleared of all cameras and recording devices.    Asked then by subcommittee Chairman John Dingell (D., Mich.) whether he has an interest in Otter Creek Associates, a limited partnership that includes Drexel executives and at times held a balance of more than $145 million in securities, Mr. Milken invoked the Fifth Amendment. He immediately asserted that right again after a second question about Otter Creek from Mr. Dingell.    Asked if he intended to answer any questions, Mr. Milken invoked the Fifth Amendment a third time. His attorney, Mr. Williams, then intervened, saying, &quot;He doesn't intend to answer any of your questions if he follows my advice.&quot;    Mr. Dingell then adjourned the hearing.    At a subsequent news conference, Mr. Dingell said the subcommittee's investigation focuses on three Drexel-led junk-bond issues in which investment partnerships involving Drexel executives bought large blocks of the bonds and resold them -- often within days -- at a profit.    &quot;There have been questions raised about whether . . . this complies with, among other things, the law relating to insider trading, front-running and possible questions of . . . what might be defined as market manipulation,&quot; Mr. Dingell said.    As previously reported, the three junk-bond issues in question involve Texstyrene Corp.; Hanover Petroleum Corp., a unit of Total Petroleum (North America) Ltd.; and the Beatrice Cos. unit of BCI Holdings Corp.    Mr. Dingell said the committee is looking into whether, in some cases, Drexel clients such as mutual funds and insurance companies &quot;not only paid higher prices&quot; than necessary for junk bonds, but were &quot;foreclosed&quot; from buying all the bonds they had requested.    By suggesting the existence of widespread irregularities in Drexel's treatment of its clients -- who by and large have remained loyal through the firm's travails -- the Dingell subcommittee could be opening up an entirely new area in the Drexel investigations.    At today's hearing, for example, evidence may be introduced showing that partnerships involving Drexel executives bought $247 million in Beatrice bonds, a major amount of an issue widely sought by investors.    Mr. Milken, 41 years old, has achieved legendary status on Wall Street. He is credited with almost single-handedly creating the huge market for junk bonds, which fueled the unprecedented takeover boom of the 1980s, and in the process helped transform Drexel into one of the nation's most profitable and powerful investment banks. The firm handled about 40% of new junk-bond issues in 1986.    Drexel issued a ringing endorsement of Mr. Milken, and said his status at the firm won't be affected by his use of the Fifth Amendment. &quot;Mike Milken has our full support. He is a colleague, a friend and an individual who has made an enormous contribution to financing this country,&quot; Drexel said.    The firm added: &quot;Mike has denied any wrongdoing, and we and our attorneys are unaware of any wrongdoing.&quot;    As previously reported, government investigators have evidence suggesting, among other things, that Mr. Milken and admitted insider trader Mr. Boesky were involved in a takeover conspiracy involving Fischbach Corp. and in an allegedly illegal scheme to park stock to conceal ownership, according to people familiar with the government investigation. A $5.3 million payment from Mr. Boesky to Drexel in March 1986 may have been part of the parking scheme, according to those people. Drexel has maintained that the $5.3 million fee was for legitimate investment-banking services, and Drexel and Mr. Milken have denied any wrongdoing.    ---   James B.
