Executive Summary</ITAG>On October 25, 1988, the Commission proposed Rule 144A to provide a non-exclusivesafe harbor exemption from the registration requirements of the SecuritiesAct of 1933 (the ``Securities Act'') \1\<NOTE/> for specified resales of restricted securities to institutionalinvestors. As proposed, the Rule would have provided a safe harbor forthree tiers of transactions. The first tier would have exempted only resalesto ``qualified institutional buyers,'' while the other two tiers wouldhave provided an exemption for resales of restricted securities to a broadergroup of institutional investors. The Commission today is reproposing forpublic comment a revised Rule 144A that would establish a single classof exempt transactions based on the ``qualified institutional buyer'' tierof the original proposal.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 77a <T3>et seq</T3>.The revised proposal contains several refinements to the first tier ofthe Rule as originally proposed. First, the definition of ``qualified institutionalbuyer'' has been revised to mean institutions with more than $100 millioninvested in securities at the conclusion of their most recent fiscal year.Under the original proposal, qualified institutional buyers would havebeen those with total assets in excess of $100 million. Second, in responseto concerns voiced by commenters about the potential development of side-by-sidepublic and private markets for the same class of securities, the Rule,as revised, would not be available for securities that, when issued, wereof the same class as securities listed on a U.S. securities exchange orquoted in the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotationsystem (``NASDAQ''). Third, availability of the Rule is proposed to beconditioned on the seller, or a person acting on its behalf, providingthe buyer upon request, with specified information, if the issuer is anon-reporting company under the Securities Exchange Act,\2\<NOTE/> and is not exempt from reporting under Rule 12g3-2(b) underthe Exchange Act. Fourth, securities of non-reporting foreign private issuerssold in reliance on Rule 144A, which are of the same class as securitiestraded in the United States, are proposed to be subject to certain resalerestrictions. Further, the Commission is proposing to revise the proposedamendments to Rules 144 and 145 to preclude ``tacking'' of holding periodsfor securities of non-reporting foreign private issuers.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ 15 U.S.C. 78a <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">II. Background</ITAG>A. Proposed Rule 144AOn October 25, 1988, the Commission published for comment a Release (the``Proposing Release'') proposing Rule 144A (the ``Rule'').\3\<NOTE/> As proposed, the Rule would have provided a safe harbor exemptionfrom the registration requirements of the Securities Act for several categoriesof resales of restricted securities to institutional investors. The proposedRule provided that, if its conditions were met, any person other than theissuer or a dealer who offered or sold securities would be deemed not tobe engaged in a ``distribution'' and therefore not to be an ``underwriter''within the meaning of sections 2(11) and 4(1) of the Securities Act.\4\<NOTE/> Similarly, an offering or selling dealer would be deemednot to be a participant in a ``distribution'' of securities within themeaning of Section 4(3)(C) of the Act, and the securities would be deemednot to have been offered ``to the public'' within the meaning of section4(3)(A) of the Act.\5\<NOTE/> The securities so offered and sold thus would not have beenrequired to be registered under the Securities Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Securities Act Release No. 6806 (Oct. 25, 1988) 53 FR44016. Eighty-nine comment letters were received. These letters and a summaryof such comment letters (``Comment Summary'') are available for publicinspection and copying at the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington,D.C. (File No. S7-23-88).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ 15 U.S.C. 77b(11), 77d(1): <T3>see </T3>proposed Rule 144A(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 15 U.S.C. 77d(3)(A), (C); <T3>see </T3>proposed Rule 144A(c).The Rule would have provided a safe harbor for three tiers of transactions.The first tier (the ``qualified institutional buyer tier'') would havepermitted unlimited resales of any securities of any issuer, provided thatthe purchaser was a specified institution with assets in excess of $100million.The second tier (the ``non-fungible securities tier'') would have permittedunlimited resales of securities to a wider class of specified institutions,if (i) securities of the class offered or sold were not quoted in an inter-dealerquotation system, listed on a securities exchange in the United States,or issued by an open-end investment company, unit investment trust or face-amountcertificate company that was registered under Section 8 of the InvestmentCompany Act of 1940 (the ``Investment Company Act''),\6\<NOTE/> and (ii) the securities were non-convertible debt securities,non-convertible preferred stock, or securities issued by a company subjectto a continuous reporting obligation under the Exchange Act.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ 15 U.S.C. 80a-8.The third tier of the Rule (the ``fungible securities tier'') would havecovered resales of the same types of securities covered by the non-fungiblesecurities tier to the same class of institutions, but would have extendedto classes of securities traded in a public market in the United States.The qualified institutional buyer and non-fungible securities tiers ofthe Rule, as proposed, would have imposed no resale restrictions, requiringonly that the seller or any person acting on its behalf take reasonablesteps to ensure that the buyer was aware that the seller might rely onthe exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Actafforded by the proposed Rule. In contrast, the fungible securities tierwould have required that the seller or any person acting on its behalftake reasonable steps to prevent the purchaser from reselling the securitiesin the United States unless the securities were registered under the SecuritiesAct or an exemption from the registration requirements was available. Theproposed Rule set forth a non-exclusive method by which that obligationcould have been satisfied. B. Response of Commenters to Rule 144A In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested extensive comment regardingthe potential impact of the Rule. Additional comment was elicted at a roundtableregarding the proposed Rule held on March 15, 1989, which was attendedby representatives of the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange,the National Association of Securities Dealers, the North American SecuritiesAdministrators Association, the Securities Industry Association, commercialand investment banks, issuers, market intermediaries, institutional investors,and the securities bar. The purpose of the roundtable was to examine thepotential effects of Rule 144A on investors (both institutional and retail),the capital raising process, the trading markets, and the internationalizationof the securities markets.\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The transcript of the roundtable (``Roundtable Transcript'')and the agenda of issues that were discussed are available for public inspectionand copying in the Commission's Public Reference Room in Washington, DC(File No. 4-345). Overall, commenters submitting letters to the Commission and those presentat the roundtable endorsed the concept of Rule 144A. Commenters believedthat the Rule would provide helpful and needed clarification of the exemptstatus of resales of privately placed securities in the secondary market,and would increase the liquidity and efficiency of the private placementmarket. These commenters noted that an increase in efficiency and liquiditycould lower significantly the discount commonly associated with privateplacements, which in turn could attract an increasing number of issuers,both foreign and domestic, into the U.S. private placement market. In response to the Commission's requests for comment regarding the implicationsof the proposed Rule with respect to the market for, and distribution of,securities, a number of commenters urged the Commission to proceed cautiouslyby adopting the Rule in stages. Most of the commenters suggesting a stagedphase-in of the Rule favored proceeding initially with a rule that wasavailable to large institutional buyers. A few suggested that the typesof securities that could be traded under the Rule should be limited tonon-convertible investment grade debt and preferred stock, securities ofsovereign issuers, or securities of a class that were not fungible withpublicly traded securities. Several suggested that a definition of ``qualifiedinstitutional buyer'' linked to securities investments would provide abetter test of an institution's investment sophistication than the proposedtotal assets test. While many agree with the Commission that some classes of institutionalinvestors clearly could fend for themselves, a number of commenters expressedconcerns about the documentation that would be provided and the abilityof secondary investors to obtain disclosure concerning the issuer. Thesecommenters supported including a requirement that the issuer provide, uponrequest, basic information concerning the issuer. In the Proposing Release, the Commission requested comment on the likelihoodthat, under Rule 144A, an active, liquid private market would develop alongsidea public market in the United States for the same class of securities.If such a development was viewed as likely, comment was requested on thenature of such markets, the consequences to the liquidity and efficiencyof the public market for such securities, and to individual investors,and whether any steps should be taken to prevent such a development. Inresponse, commenters were divided, some concurring with the Commission'sview that significant side-by-side markets were unlikely. Others, however,stated that the proposed Rule might have the effect of diverting some securitiesaway from the public market to the private market and expressed concernthat public markets and investors in those markets might be disadvantagedby resulting reduced liquidity, differential pricing, and volatility. Severalcommenters also expressed the position that the Rule would decrease thequality and quantity of securities available to retail investors. The Proposing Release noted that permitting tacking of holding periodsunder Rule 144, as proposed, could accelerate the movement of previouslyrestricted securities into the public market.\8\<NOTE/> In light of this potential, the Commission requested commenton the appropriateness of continuing the exemption from the Exchange Actreporting requirements provided by Rule 12g3-2(b) \9\<NOTE/> for foreign private issuers whose equity securities becomewidely held by non-institutional investors, if proposed Rule 144A wereadopted. In the case of domestic issuers, under section 12(g) of the ExchangeAct,\10\<NOTE/> the public markets would be protected because a company withmore than $5 million in assets incurs reporting obligations when any classof its equity securities is held by 500 or more persons.\11\<NOTE/> In the case of foreign securities, however, there would beno such protection because Rule 12g3-2(b) permits securities to be heldby any number of shareholders, without reporting obligations being incurred,as long as the securities are not quoted in NASDAQ or listed on a U.S.securities exchange. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Proposing Release, 53 FR at 44023. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 17 CFR 240.12g3-2(b). A foreign private issuer exemptfrom the periodic reporting requirements of Section 12(g) under Rule 12g3-2(b)is required to furnish to the Commission all documents it is required tomake public or file with regulatory authorities in its home jurisdiction.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>l</T3>(g). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Rule 12g-1 [17 CFR 240.12g-1].While recognizing that proposed Rule 144A has the potential to attractadditional foreign issuers into the U.S. market, commenters urged thatRule 12g3-2(b) be retained in its current form. These commenters statedthat elimination of the rule would be inconsistent with the policy of encouragingincreased trading in the United States by foreign issuers, and that theanticipated benefits of Rule 144A would be offset by repeal or modificationof Rule 12g3-2(b).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Overview of Reproposed Rule 144A</ITAG>The Commission agrees with the commenters that Rule 144A is likely to improvesubstantially the efficiency and liquidity of the U.S. private placementmarket, and as a result may well have major implications for financingpractices in the United States of both domestic and foreign issuers. TheCommission, therefore, proposes to implement the Rule in stages, to allowmarket participants to gain experience and assess the effects of the Ruleon the securities markets and on investors. Thus the Rule, as reproposed,would apply to offers and sales of securities to specified large institutions;essentially, the reproposal is a modified version of the first tier ofthe original proposed Rule. The Commission specifically invites commentsregarding steps that can be taken to evaluate the performance of Rule 144Amarkets, if the Rule is adopted, and, eventually, to extend the scope ofRule 144A beyond the specific provisions contemplated in this reproposal.When it initially proposed Rule 144A, the Commission noted that it didnot expect that Rule 144A would give rise to any significant volume ofprivate transactions in classes of publicly-traded securities. Notwithstandingthe potential for increased efficiency in the private resale market andthe ability to avoid costs and delays associated with registration, informationcurrently available to the Commission suggests that it would not be financiallyadvantageous for companies generally to sell securities in a market thatwas limited in its depth and liquidity compared to an existing public marketfor the same securities.\12\<NOTE/> Nevertheless, the Commission requested comment on the likelihoodthat such trading would evolve and whether steps should be taken to precludethe development of such side-by-side markets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Proposing Release, 53 FR at 44022.<ITAG tagnum="28">As the Commission noted in the Proposing Release, public companiesreportedly tend to issue equity securities privately only in special circumstances,such as in transactions involving debt securities with an equity component,a leveraged buy-out, a joint venture, or a restructuring. Proposing Release,53 FR at 44020 n.43.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">Moreover, securities in the institutional market would be likely toflow into the public market when the holding period requirement of Rule144A was satisfied. Thus, it appears unlikely that the institutional marketfor such securities would grow larger than the public market for the sameclass of securities over time.</ITAG>Commenters were divided regarding the likelihood that side-by-side marketswould develop. Several commenters, however, urged the Commission to takesteps to preclude such markets from developing, although they did not explainwhy they believed substantial institutional markets would develop in publiclytraded equities (which presumably would still trade at a discount to thesame securities in the public market). The Commission remains of the opinionthat development of significant side-by-side markets is unlikely. Nonetheless,the Rule, as reproposed by the Commission today, would not extend to transactionsin securities of a class that is publicly traded in the United States.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ Publicly traded securities would include securities listedon a national securities exchange or quoted in an automated inter-dealerquotation system. <T3>See infra </T3>n. 31 and accompanying text.To address the potential of Rule 144A to increase substantially the amountof foreign securities being sold into the retail market without ExchangeAct periodic reporting obligations being incurred, the Commission proposesto make two changes to the original proposal. First, as revised, tackingof holding periods in Rules 144 and 145 would be precluded for the securitiesof non-reporting foreign private issuers. Second, resale restrictions areproposed to be included in Rule 144A for transactions involving securitesof non-reporting foreign private issuers traded in both a U.S. and foreignmarket. These changes should minimize the effect of Rule 144A on individualinvestors, \14\<NOTE/> without the substantial problems inherent in restrictingthe current availability of Rule 12g3-2(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ Rule 906 of proposed Regulation S, permitting substantialaccess to foreign markets for resales, should also operate to assure thatthere will not be significant leakage into the U.S. public markets.In response to concerns expressed by commenters regarding the need fora minimum level of disclosure about the issuer of securities to be resoldunder the Rule, the Commission proposes to require, as a condition to theavailability of the Rule, that, where the issuer of the securities is anon-reporting company and is not exempt from Exchange Act reporting requirementsunder Rule 12g3-2(b), the seller of the securities or a person acting onits behalf provide the buyer upon request with specified basic informationregarding the issuer.Finally, the Commission wishes to reiterate its statement in the ProposingRelease that proposed Rule 144A and the revisions proposed today are notintended to preclude reliance on traditional facts-and-circumstances analysisto prove the availability of an exemption outside the safe harbor Rule144A would provide.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion of Revised Proposed Rule 144A</ITAG>A. Eligible PurchasersAs reproposed, for a transaction to qualify under the safe harbor exemptionprovided by Rule 144A, the securities could be offered or sold only toa ``qualified institutional buyer,'' or to an offeree or purchaser thatthe seller and any person acting on its behalf reasonably believed wasa qualified institutional buyer.Commenters addressing the definition of ``qualified institutional buyer''in the initial proposal were divided as to whether the proposed eligibilitythreshold of $100 million of total assets should be used to define theclass of participating institutions, some stating the threshold was appropriate,others arguing for a lower threshold, and others for a higher threshold.Commenters also suggested that qualified institutions should be requiredeither to have at least $100 million invested in securities or to exerciseinvestment discretion with respect to at least that amount of investmentassets owned by others.The revised proposal would define ``qualified institutional buyer'' tobe an institution, acting for its own account, that at the conclusion ofits most recent fiscal year had assets invested in securities purchasedfor a total of more than $100 million.\15\<NOTE/> A definition focused on assets invested in securities shouldtarget, with more precision than the asset test originally proposed, sophisticatedinstitutions with experience in investing in securities. Given this revisionin the definition, the Rule, as reproposed, would extend to entities formedfor the purpose of acquiring restricted securities if they satisfied thisdefinitional standard. The change to a test based on investments in securitieswould substantially reduce the number of institutional investors that wouldbe qualified institutional buyers for purposes of the Rule if the thresholdremains $100 million. The table below shows for several classes of institutionalinvestors the effect of various eligibility thresholds.\16\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ The term ``security'' is defined in Section 2(1) of theSecurities Act (15 U.S.C. 77b(1)).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ Information with respect to thresholds lower than $100million was not always available in time to be included in the release.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>7,L2,tp0,i1,s100,10,xs60,10,xs80,xs60,xs60</C> <H1> </H1><H1>No. of investment companies </H1>a<H1>No. of broker-dealer firms </H1>b<H1>No. of insurance companies </H1>c<H1>No. of commercial banks andamp; trust companies</H1><H1>No. of FDIC-insured savings banks</H1><H1>No. of FSLIC-insured Sandamp;Ls and savings banks </H1>d<ITAG tagnum="1">1.

Such a lower threshold wouldreflect the fact that the change from an ``assets'' test to an ``investmentsin securities'' test provides a more stringent standard with greater intrinsicsafeguards.\17\<NOTE/> The Commission also requests information regarding the numberand types of institutions (<T3>e.g.</T3>, venture capital firms, industrial corporations, etc.) thatwould qualify if the threshold were $25 million, $50 million, $75 million,or $100 million invested in securities. Those commenters providing suchinformation should specify whether the institutions satisfying the foregoingthresholds are currently participating in the U.S. private placement market.Comment is also requested as to the percentage of private placement investmentaccounted for by institutions with securities investments at each of thespecified threshold levels. To what extent, if any, should the $100 millionthreshold be revised, or industry-specific standards used, to assure thatthe institutional investors in a particular industry can be said to be<T3>per se</T3> sophisticated? To what extent, if any, should the thresholdbe changed to avoid undue disruption of current restricted securities resalepractices or markets? Comment is requested as to the threshold of eligibleparticipants necessary to achieve the anticipated efficiencies in the privateplacement market. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\On July 11, 1989, the Commission adopted Exchange ActRule 15a-6, 17 CFR andSection;240.15a-6, concerning registration requirementsfor foreign broker-dealers. [Exchange Act Release No. 27017 (July 11, 1989)].The definition of a ``major U.S. institutional investor'' under that ruleparallels the total assets test used in the original proposal of Rule 144Ato define a ``qualified institutional buyer.'' The Commission requestscomment on whether the definition in Rule 15a-6 should be amended to conformwith the revised definition of a qualified institutional buyer includedin revised Rule 144A. The Commission also requests comment on whether it would be appropriatein this first stage to make the Rule available to a broader class of institutions(for example, those that have invested over $10 million, $25 million, $50million or $75 million in securities), where the transaction involves securitiesof issuers filing periodic reports with the Commission under the ExchangeAct. Using such a lower threshold would reflect the protections affordedby the availability of Exchange Act information, which provides accessto the same issuer information provided in a Securities Act registrationstatement for purchasers of publicly traded securities. Commenters respondingto the Proposing Release did not address the issue of why the availabilityof Exchange Act information did not justify making the Rule available toa wider group of institutional purchasers. As was originally proposed, eligibility of an investment adviser wouldbe determined by aggregating proprietary assets and discretionary assetsunder management, and eligibility of a registered investment company thatis part of a ``family of funds'' would be determined by aggregating theassets of the family.\18\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\18\In the initial proposal, ``family of funds'' was definedto mean any two or more registered investment companies which share thesame investment adviser <T3>or</T3> principal underwriter <T3>and</T3> hold themselves out to investors as related companies. Thisdefinition has been revised to include only registered investment companiesthat share the same investment adviser (or, in the case of unit investmenttrusts, the same depositor). <T3>See</T3> proposed Rule 144A(a)(3)(i). Like the original proposal, the revised Rule permits a bank or savingsand loan to purchase securities for accounts over which it exercises investmentdiscretion, as well as for its own account. Due to the particular historicaldevelopment of bank and savings and loan participation in the securitiesmarkets, however, proprietary and fiduciary investments in securities couldnot be aggregated in order to meet the $100 million threshold for eligibility.This qualification to the eligibility test reflects the separate managementof proprietary assets and fiduciary accounts by banks and thrifts, as ifthe two classes of assets comprised separate entities.\19\<NOTE/> The Commission requests comment on whether the investmentstructure of these institutions warrants this treatment, or whether banksand savings and loan institutions should be permitted to aggregate thetwo types of portfolios in determining eligibility. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\19\This practice is followed by national banks because regulationsissued by the Comptroller of the Currency require such banks to separateinvestments of fiduciary accounts from proprietary assets (12 CFR andSection;9.13).Additionally, such investments must ``be placed in the joint custody orcontrol of not less than two of the officers or employees of the bank designatedfor that purpose by the board of directors of the bank or by one or moreofficers designated by the board of directors of the bank * * *.'' <T3>Id.</T3> Savings and loan institutions also follow this practice (12CFR andSection;550.6). The reproposed Rule would permit aggregation of securities held by wholly-ownedbank subsidiaries of a bank holding company, operating either in a statethat prohibits or restricts branch banking or in more than one state, indetermining the eligibility of the holding company and any such wholly-ownedsubsidiary to purchase under the Rule. The holding company structure inthese cases is necessitated by provisions of federal and state law andshould not operate to the disadvantage of these companies under Rule 144A,precluding them from being qualified institutional buyers. The Commissionrequests comment regarding whether allowing such aggregation is appropriate,and whether such treatment should be extended to savings and loan holdingcompanies. In determining whether an institution is a qualified institutional buyer,a seller would measure the value of that institution's securities portfolioby the total cost of the securities in the portfolio. The Commission isproposing that purchaser eligibility be determined on a fiscal year-endbasis because this would provide a brightline test and, to the extent thatinformation regarding the purchaser's securities investments is disclosedin its financial statements or regulatory reports, such information ismost likely to be available on a year-end basis. The Commission requestscomment on whether the eligibility of an institution should instead bebased on its securities portfolio on a quarterly basis. The original Rule proposal provided that sellers could rely upon informationfiled with the Commission in establishing the requisite reasonable beliefthat a prospective purchaser was a qualified institutional buyer.\20\<NOTE/> In response to the proposal, several commenters suggestedthat sellers also should be able to rely on information filed with otherfederal or state regulatory agencies because not all eligible institutionalbuyers file information with the Commission. The proposal has been modifiedin response to such comments, and, in light of the likely use of Rule 144Afor securities of foreign issuers, reliance on foreign government or self-regulatoryorganization filings would be permitted as well. Therefore, in determiningwhether a particular entity is a qualified institutional buyer, the sellerand any person acting on its behalf could rely upon publicly availableinformation regarding the securities investments of the entity appearingin financial statements or other material filed with the Commission oranother United States federal, state, or local governmental agency or self-regulatoryorganization, or with a foreign governmental agency or foreign self-regulatoryorganization. The seller and any person acting on its behalf could relyupon such filings as a non-exclusive means of satisfying the reasonablebelief standard if the information is disclosed in the filings.\21\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ The term ``reasonable belief'' as used in Rule 144A wouldhave the same meaning as it does in Regulation D (17 CFR 230.501-.506).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Given the change in the purchaser eligibility test fromtotal assets to investments in securities, such filings may not disclosesuch information specifically for all classes of issuers. Regulation S-Xspecifies the form and content of investment portfolio disclosures forcompanies that file financial statements with the Commission. <T3>See </T3>17 CFR 210.1-01 <T3>et seq. </T3>All such companies are required to present, on at leastan annual basis, marketable securities separately on the balance sheet,if material, classified into current and non-current components. 17 CFR210.5-02.2, 6-04.1, 6-06.1, 6A-03.2, 7-03.1, and 9-03.6. More detaileddisclosure of the aggregate amounts of the various marketable securitiescategories (<T3>e.g., </T3>government obligations, corporate equities, corporate debentures)is required on the balance sheet or notes thereto of certain registeredinvestment companies, employee stock purchase plans, bank holding companies,and savings and loan holding companies. 17 CFR 210.6-06.1, 6A-03.2, 7-03.1,9-03.6; Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 69. In addition, detailed marketablesecurities portfolio information including number of shares or units, cost,market value, and carrying value by type of issuer within each categoryof marketable securities may be required in a supplemental schedule. 17CFR 210.12-02. Registered investment companies, employee stock purchaseplans, and insurance companies are required to provide this informationin all cases. 17 CFR 210.6-10(c), (d) and (e), 6A-05, and 7-05. Commercialand industrial companies are required to provide this information if: (1)either total current or total non-current marketable securities constitute10 percent or more of total assets; (2) total current and non-current marketablesecurities in the aggregate constitute 15 percent or more of total assets;or (3) total marketable securities of a single issuer constitute two percentor more of total assets. 17 CFR 210.5-04. Bank holding companies and savingsand loan holding companies are not required to provide the supplementalschedule, but are required to provide detailed investment portfolio informationas part of the description of business in filings with the Commission.<T3>See </T3>Industry Guide 3; Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 69. Additionally,information regarding securities investments of a commercial bank appearin its Report of Condition and Income (call report) on Form FFIEC 031,and in its Annual Report of Trust Assets on Form FFIEC 001 that are filedwith the Comptroller of the Currency. Information regarding securitiesinvestments of savings and loan institutions and savings banks under thejurisdiction of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (``FHLBB'') would appearin the Thrift Financial Report filed on Form 1313 with the FHLBB and inthe certified financial statements they must file with the Federal HomeLoan Bank in the District in which they are located. Information regardingsecurities investments of insurance companies may appear in the annualstatements they must file with state insurance regulators. Additionally, the Commission has added as a <T3>per se </T3>reasonable basis of belief of eligibility, informationpublished in the ``recognized securities manual.'' Where a publicationlike Moody's includes financial information that would provide the requisiteinformation concerning securities investments, reliance on such informationwould be a basis for reasonable belief as to the institution's eligibility.The scope of the term ``recognized securities manual'' would be a matterof interpretation. Many states have exemptions based on publication ina recognized securities manual. The Commission would recognize similarmanuals, such as Standard andamp; Poor's Corporation Records; Moody's publications,including the Industrial, Transportation, OTC Industrial, the Bank andFinance, the Public Utility, and the International manuals and Best's InsuranceReports. Questions as to any other particular publication would be answeredby the staff. Several commenters stated that adoption of Rule 144A would necessitatea reevaluation of the limits currently placed on investments in restrictedsecurities by certain types of investment companies. Open-end managementinvestment companies (``mutual funds'') and unit investment trusts (``UITs'')issue redeemable securities,\22\<NOTE/> and are required by section 22(e) of the Investment CompanyAct to make payment to shareholders for securities tendered for redemptionwithin seven days of their tender.\23\<NOTE/> These investment companies must maintain a high degree ofliquidity to assure that portfolio securities can be sold and the proceedsused to meet redemptions in a timely manner. Guide 13 to Form N-1A \24\<NOTE/> states the staff position that the usual limit on aggregateholdings by mutual funds of illiquid assets is ten percent of the valueof the company's assets. Generally, an ``illiquid security'' is any securitythat cannot be disposed of promptly and in the ordinary course of businesswithin taking a reduced price.\25\<NOTE/> The Commission has taken the position that restricted securitiesare <T3>per se </T3>illiquid.\26\<NOTE/> The commenters urged that, if Rule 144A is adopted, the Commissionshould reconsider this position to permit investment companies to participatemore fully in the private markets, which are expected to be more liquidas a result of the Rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\22\ <T3>See </T3>Sections 5(a)(1) and 4(2) of the Investment Company Act of1940 (15 U.S.C. andSection;andSection; 80a-5(a)(1) and 80a-4(2)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\23\ 15 U.S.C. 80a-22(e). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\24\ 17 CFR 274.11A. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\25\ Investment Company Act Release No. 14983 (March 12, 1986)(51 FR 9773). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\26\ Investment Company Act Release No. 5847 (Oct. 21, 1969)(35 FR 19989). In the case of UITs, the Division of Investment Managementhas taken the position that, if the sponsor maintains a secondary marketfor trust units so that units are rarely redeemed, the UIT may have upto fifty percent of its assets invested in restricted securities. <T3>See </T3>Guide 3 to proposed Form N-7 in Investment Company Act Rel.No. 15612 (Mar. 9, 1987) (52 FR 8268). The Commission is considering revising its position so that, if Rule 144Ais adopted, mutual funds and UITs would not be required to treat securitieseligible for resale under rule 144A as <T3>per se </T3>illiquid. The determination of the liquidity of Rule 144Asecurties in the portfolio of an investment company issuing redeemablesecurities would be a question of fact for the board of directors to determine,based upon the trading market for the specific security. Comment is requestedon whether the Commission should revise its position and, if so, whetherany special conditions should be imposed to assure the liquidity of thesesecurities. Commenters are requested to provide information as to any assumptionsabout market conditions that investment company boards of directors makein determining whether portfolio securities are liquid.Generally, securities that cannot be publicly offered or sold because ofstatutory, regulatory or contractual arangements or other restrictionsare deemed by the Commission's uniform net capital rule \27\<NOTE/> to be non-marketable securities, and broker-dealers are requiredin their net capital computation to deduct 100 percent of the carryingvalue of such securities.\28\<NOTE/> The Division of Market Regulation has taken the positionin the past that a ready market could be deemed to exist with respect tosecurities that would otherwise be deemed to be non-marketable under therule.\29\<NOTE/> The division of Market Regulation is currently studying themarketability of certain short and medium term unregistered debt instrumentsand will expand its study to cover instruments which may be traded pursuantto Rule 144A. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\27\ Rule 15c3-1 (17 CFR 240.15c3-1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\28\ <T3>See </T3>Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(vii) (17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(vii)). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\29\ <T3>See </T3>Rule 15c3-1(c)(11) [17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(11)], and the Divisionof Market Regulation's letter dated December 29, 1975 to the SecuritiesIndustry Association. Rule 15c3-1(c)(11) of the uniform net capital rulesets forth the definition of what constitutes a ``ready market'' for securities.B. Exclusion of Fungible Securities From Rule As reproposed, Rule 144A would not extend to the offer or sale of securitiesthat, when issued, were of the same class as securities listed on a nationalsecurities exchange registered under section 6 of the Exchange Act \30\<NOTE/> or quoted in an automated inter-dealer quotation system.\31\<NOTE/> This revision to the original proposed Rule is designed toaddress concerns expresed by commenters that Rule 144A could result inthe development of side-by-side public and private markets for the sameclass of securities. As a result of the revision, privately-placed securitiesthat, at the time of their issuance, are fungible with securities tradingon a U.S. exchange or quoted in NASDAQ would not be eligible for resaleunder the proposed Rule. Where American Depositary Shares (``ADSs'') arepublicly traded in the United States, the deposited securities underlyingthe ADSs also would be considered publicly traded and could not be soldin reliance on the Rule. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\30\ 15 U.S.C. 78f. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\31\ Consistent with the use of the term in Rule 12g3-2(b),an ``automated inter-dealer quotation system'' would include NASDAQ butwould exclude bid and ask quotations in the current ``pink sheets'' ofthe National Quotation Bureau, Inc.Under the Rule, as reproposed, eligibility for resale would be determinedat the time of issuance in the interest of certainty. Thus, privately placedsecurities of nonreporting companies that go public thereafter would stillbe eligible to be sold in reliance on the proposed Rule. While this couldresult in some side-by-side trading, it should not be substantial. ProposedRule 144(k) can be expected to result in privately placed securities flowingfrom the private market to the public market three years after issuance.Accordingly, the potential for substantial side-by-side markets developingwhen a privately held issuer makes an initial public offering appears quitelimited both in its duration and in its effect on the public markets.In the alternative, fungibility could be measured at the time of each resalemade under the Rule. To assure against loss of bargained for liquidity,purchasers could obtain registration rights that would be triggered ifpublic trading commenced in securities of the same class. The Commissionrequests comment on both alternatives and on whether concerns about side-by-sidemarkets developing in the securities of issuers newly traded in the publicmarkets are substantial enough to necessitate changing the rule to measurefungibility on a transaction-by-transaction basis.The reproposed Rule provides that convertible securities, exercisable withinthree years of issuance, would be treated as securities of both classes.In the original Rule proposal, for purposes of determining fungibilityin the context of the fungible securities tier, all convertible securitieswere considered securities of both classes. Upon reconsideration, thisdoes not appear necessary to serve the purposes of the Rule. The three-yearperiod parallels Rule 144(k). Thus, if the underlying security were ofa class that were traded publicly, even if the senior security were not,the senior security could not be resold under Rule 144A. This treatmentis intended to prevent side-by-side markets from developing in the underlyingsecurities through the sale of convertible securities. The Commission requestscomment on whether the purpose of this provision would be adequately servedby a shorter period of non-exercisability, such as one or two years and,if so, why. The Commission also requests comment on whether an alternativetest relying on premiums upon conversion, such as 15 percent or 20 percent,would adequately protect against side-by-side markets developing in theunderlying securities.C. Provision of InformationAs reproposed, the Rule would require that the seller provide to the buyer,upon request, basic information concerning the business of the issuer andits final statements, if the issuer was not a reporting company under theExchange Act or exempt from Exchange Act reporting pursuant to Rule 12g3-2(b).\32\<NOTE/> As noted above, the Commission is proposing the informationrequirement in response to concerns raised with respect to the effect ofthe proposed rule and the securities.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\32\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rule 144A(d)(4).Where the issuer is a reporting company under the Exchange Act or is providingthe information required to maintain a reporting exemption pursuant toRule 12g3-2(b), publicly available information should sufficiently allaythose concerns. Where such information is not available, the proposed informationrequirement would condition the availability of the rule on the selleror person acting on its behalf providing the buyer with the specified information.The rule does not specify the manner in which the seller would obtain thespecified information; the information could be obtained pursuant to contractedrights with the issuer or in any other manner.The Commission requests comment as to whether the information conditionshould be deleted in its entirety, on the theory that qualified institutionalbuyers are sophisticated investors that are able to adequately assess theirneed for information and to determine when to proceed with an investment.Will the requirement unnecessarily impair the efficiency of resale transactionsunder the proposed rule? The Commission also requests comment as to whetherthe requirement should be expanded to apply to all transactions subjectto Rule 144A, or to require that the holder of the security have the rightto obtain such information upon request from the issuer directly. Wouldthe issuer's liability with respect to the information be altered by adelivery to the holder requirement?<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Securities of Foreign Non-Reporting Issuers</ITAG>In the Proposing Release, the Commission expressed concerns regarding thepossibility that non-reporting foreign issuers' securities, originallyissued to and resold among institutions in a transaction or chain of transactionsnot involving any public offering, would flow into the retail market andbecome widely held by non-institutional investors without adequate publiclyavailable information concerning the issuer because of the exemption fromthe Exchange Act's reporting requirements provided by Rule 12g3-2(b). \33\<NOTE/> As noted above, commenters expressing a view on this issueadvised the Commission that such concerns should not be resolved by repealingor otherwise amending Rule 12g3-2(b), on which more than 1400 foreign issuerscurrently rely. Rather than modify Rule 12g3-2(b), the Commission proposesto impose resale restrictions on securities of non-reporting foreign privateissuers traded in both a U.S. and foreign securities market, which aresold in reliance upon the Rule, \34\<NOTE/> and to revise the amendments to Rule 144 to preclude ``tacking''of holding periods for securities issued by non-reporting foreign privateissuers.\35\<NOTE/> Thus, resales of such securities into the retail market underRule 144 could be made only after the investor had held the security forat least two years. This revision, coupled with the offense resale provisionsof proposed Regulation S, \36\<NOTE/> should minimize the potential for proposed Rule 144A to increasesignificantly the sale of foreign securities in the United States to investorsother than institutions eligible to purchase under the Rule. The proposedresale restrictions further should impede any flow of securities of non-reportingforeign private issuers into the U.S. public markets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\33\ Proposing Release, 53 FR 15 44023.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\34\ <T3>See</T3> proposed Rule 144A(d)(5).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\35\ <T3>See infra</T3> n. 43 and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\36\ <T3>See</T3> Rule 906 of proposed Regulation S. Under Rule 906, resalesof securities by persons other than the issuer or a distributor could bemade immediately into foreign markets provided certain conditions weremet. As a result, rather than wait for the expiration of the applicableholding period under Rule 144, proposed Rule 906 would provide an incentivefor holders of restricted securities to resell such securities overseaswhere they seek access to the foreign trading markets.A. Resale RestrictionsResale restrictions are proposed to be incorporated in Rule 144A. The revisedRule would requre that, where securities of non-reporting foreign privateissuers were traded in the United States, steps would be taken to preventtheir leakage into the retail market.\3\\7\<NOTE/> Resale restrictions would apply if, at the time of the resale,the issuer of the securities was a foreign private issuer that was notsubject to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, and securities of thesame class were traded on or through the facilities of a foreign securitiesexchange or designated organized foreign securities market,\3\\8\<NOTE/> and quoted in a U.S. inter-dealer quotation system withinthe previous 12 months.\3\\9\<NOTE/> The criteria are intended to apply resale restrictions tosecurities fungible with securities traded in the United States. The practicaleffect of this standard would be that most foreign debt securities generallywould not be subject to resale restrictions. The Commission requests comment,however, whether 12 months is a reasonable period of time, and if not,whether a six or three month period during which quotations have appearedin a U.S. inter-dealer quotation system would suffice. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\7\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Rule 144A(d)(5).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\8\ The term ``designated organized foreign securitiesmarket'' would have the same meaning as in Rule 902(a) of proposed RegulationS, and would mean any market for trading of securities designated by theDivision of Corporation Finance that is organized under foreign law; hasan established operating history; and is subject to oversight by a governmentalor self-regulatory body to which securities transactions are reported ona regular basis. <T3>See </T3>Securities Act Release No. 33-6838 July 11, 1989) (Reg S reproposal).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\9\ The term ``inter-dealer quotation system'' would bedefined by reference to Rule 15c2-11(e)(2) [17 CFR andSection; 240.15c-11(e)(2)],as ``any system of general circulation to brokers and dealers which regularlydisseminates quotations of identified brokers or dealers * * * '' Sucha system would include NASDAO as well as the National Quotation BureauInc. ``pink sheets.''The proposed Rule would require that the seller of the restricted securities,or a person acting on its behalf, take reasonable steps to prevent thepurchaser of such securities from reselling the securities in the UnitedStates without restriction or an available exemption. Where precautionaryprocedures were implemented and followed properly, a seller's transactionwould be protected by the safe harbor, notwithstanding any subsequent non-exemptunregistered distribution by a purchaser. In such cases, the resellingpurchaser would be in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act,\4\\0\<NOTE/> but not the prior holder that sold in compliance with thesafe harbor Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\0\ 15 U.S.C. 77e.The Rule provides that reasonable steps to guard againt an unregistered,non-exempt public offering would be conclusively established where thepurchasers agreed in writing not to resell the securities in the UnitedStates absent registration or an applicable exemption, and there existeda procedure administered by the issuer or a third party that was reasonablydesigned to prevent the transfer of the restricted securities to otherthan qualified institutional buyers, unless the securities were registeredunder the Securities Act or an exemption was available.\4\\1\<NOTE/> The existence of such a procedure could be established, forexample, where the securities were subject to stop transfer instructions,legends or restrictions designed to prevent the unregistered distributionof restricted securities into the U.S. public market. The issuer in establishingsuch a procedure could rely on the reasonable belief standard in proposedRule 144A(d)(1) in assessing a buyer's qualification. As noted in the ProposingRelease, sellers could rely on a closed trading system that limited tradingto qualifying institutions and established depositary and clearance systemssuch that trades could be made only to other such institutions or outsidethe United States.\4\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\1\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Rule 144A(d)(5).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\2\ <T3>See </T3>Proposing Release, 53 FR at 44030, 44031. The American StockExchange, Inc. has proposed a domestic market for institutional tradingof unregistered foreign securities to be known as SITUS, for ``System forInstitution Trading of Unregistered Securities.'' The National Associationof Securities Dealers, Inc. has proposed a NASDAQ-type system for the tradingof unregistered securities of major foreign and domestic issuers. The NASDsystem will be known as PORTAL, for ``Private Offerings, Resales and Tradingthrough Automated Linkages.'' The Commission has not yet made any determinationas to the status of either SITUS or PORTAL under the Securities Act andthe Exchange Act.The seller's failure to take the particular steps specified in the Rulewould not create a presumption that it has acted unreasonably to guardagainst an unregistered, non-exempt public offering. In the absence oftaking the specified steps, the seller would remain free to establish thatother reasonable steps had been taken to prevent an unregistered distributionin the United States.The Commission requests comment on the effectiveness of the proposed resalerestrictions in preventing an unregistered public offering, and specificallyrequests comment on the need for such resale restrictions to protect againstRule 144A's significantly increasing the amount of securities of non-reportingforeign issuers being sold to ineligible buyers.B. Proposed Amendments to Rules 144 and 145As originally proposed, the amendments to Rule 144 would have permitteda holder of securities acquired in a transaction or chain of transactionsnot involving any public offering to include in its holding period theperiod that prior holders unaffiliated with the issuer of such securitiesheld the securities. The amendments would have permitted such ``tacking''regardless of the status of the issuer of the restricted securities. Uponconsideration of the comments received, as noted above, the Commissionnow proposes to modify the amendments so that each purchaser of restrictedsecurities of non-reporting foreign private issuers would continue to berequired to hold the securities for the specified holding period to resellingthe securities pursuant to Rule 144.\4\\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\3\ Proposed Rule 144(d)(1) and 144(k); proposed Rule 145(d).The permissibility of tacking would be determined at the time of the proposedresale. Thus, if the foreign private issuer became a reporting companyafter issuance of the restricted securities, subsequent sellers of suchsecurities would be able to tack the holding periods of previous unaffiliatedholders. Under the original proposal, the Commission proposed to eliminate certainprovisions allowing tacking as no longer necessary.\4\\4\<NOTE/> These provisions would be preserved, as revised, to conformto this change to the Commission's original proposal.\4\\5\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\4\ Proposing Release, 53 FR at 44032, 44033. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\5\ <T3>See </T3>proposed Rules 144 (d)(2), (d)(3), and (d)(4)(iv) through(d)(4)(vii), and proposed rule 145(d). In addition, the Commission has made several technical and clarifying changesto the Rules. Such changes are incorporated, as discussed below, in proposedparagraphs (d) (1) and (d)(4)(viii) of Rule 144, and paragraph (d) of Rule145. Proposed Rule 144(d)(1) has been revised to clarify that a person acquiringrestricted securities from a non-affiliated record owner holding the securitiesin nominee name on behalf of an affiliate must satisfy the full two orthree year holding period that, under new paragraph (d)(1), would beginupon any acquisition of restricted securities from an affiliate. Upon reconsideration,the Commission has inserted in proposed paragraph (d)(1) language fromexisting paragraph (d)(1) referring to commencement of the holding periodupon acquisition from the issuer or an affiliate only where there fullpurchase price or other consideration is paid or given by the acquiror.This change is consistent with the Commission's position that considerationfor the acquisition of securities may be paid through services and othernon-cash media. Technical amendments have been made to proposed Rule 144(d)(4)(viii) andparagraphs 145 (d)(2) and (d)(3) to clarify the Commission's intent thatthe holding period for securities acquired in merger or other Rule 145(a)transaction begins at the time of the transaction, not the subsequent datewhen the securities are issued. A modification to Rule 144(k) also is proposed in response to public comment.As outlined in the Proposing Release,\4\\6\<NOTE/> a proposed amendment to this provision would allow a personwho has been a non-affiliate for three or more months to resell restrictedsecurities free of the volume, information, manner of sale and Form 144filing requirements if the securities have been held for at least threeyears from the later of the date of their acquisition from either an issueror its affiliate. This modification of current Rule 144(k) was intendedsolely to incorporate the liberalized tacking principle to be embodiedin revised paragraph (d)(1), pursuant to which the three-year holding periodmust be calculated. One commentator nonetheless has suggested that, ifadopted as drafted, amended paragraph (k) could be construed to preventa non-affiliated trust from combining with its own holding period thatof its settlor. To minimize the potential for misinterpretation, the Commissionhas proposed to revise paragraph (k) to clarify that a non-affiliate takingrestricted securities from an affiliate of the issuer in connection withany of the no-sale transactions set forth in amended paragraphs (d)(4)(iv)through (d)(4)(vii) of Rule 144 would be permitted to sell in accordancewith paragraph (k), notwithstanding his transferer's affiliate status,and to tack the latter's holding period to his own for purposes of complyingwith the three-year requirement.\4\\7\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\6\ Proposing Release, 53 FR at 44032, discussing proposedRule 144(d)(4)(viii). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\\7\ <T3>See, e.g., Everest andamp; Jennings International </T3>(Nov. 19, 1981).<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Cost-Benefit Analysis</ITAG>As an aid in the evaluation of the costs and benefits of these revisedproposals, the Commission requests the views and other supporting informationfrom the public. It appears to the Commission that the proposals, if adopted,would work significant cost savings for issuers without compromising investorprotection.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. Summary of Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis </ITAG>The Commission has prepared an Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis(``Analysis'') in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603 regarding proposed Rule144A and the proposed amendments to Rules 144 and 145. The Analysis explainsthat the Commission proposed Rule 144A because it appeared that, in certaincircumstances, specified institutional investors may not need the protectionof the registration provisions of the Securities Act, and that registrationin such circumstances may impose undue burdens on the parties to thesetransactions. The Analysis explains that the proposed amendments to Rules144 and 145 are intended to provide more equitable means of determiningthe period for which restricted securities must be held before public resaleis protected by the rules. The Analysis indicates that the effect of Rule 144A would be to enhancethe liquidity of the private secondary market, thus making it easier forissuers, including small issuers, to sell their securities in that market.It notes that if the qualified institutional buyer tier was adopted asoriginally proposed, small issuers would not be disproportionately affectedby Rule 144A, as that tier would not be limited to debt securities, preferredstock and securities issued by reporting issuers. The revised definitionof ``qualified institutional buyer'' would similarly not limit the securitiesthat would be permitted to be sold in reliance on the Rule, except forsecurities of the same class as securities listed on a national securitiesexchange or quoted in an automated inter-dealer quotation system. Thisexception, however, would affect, without regard to size, all issuers contemplatinga private or public offering. The Analysis further states that small entitiesthat are broker-dealers generally would be affected by proposed Rule 144Ain the same way as other investment firms. The Analysis also indicates that proposed Rule 144A contains no reportingrequirements. Rather, adoption of the Rule may result in decreased reporting,recordkeeping, and other compliance requirements with respect to transactionscovered by the Rule. The amendments to Rules 144 and 145 would similarlyhave no significant effect on reporting, recordkeeping and other compliancerequirements. A copy of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis may be obtained fromBrent H. Taylor, Division of Corporation Finance, U.S. Securities and ExchangeCommission, 450 Fifth Street, NW., Washington, DC 20549.
