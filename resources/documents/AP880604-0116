(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Virginia Gov. Charles S. Robb,nominated by acclamation for the U.S. Senate, was shouted downduring his acceptance speech Saturday by Democratic conventiondelegates who support Jesse Jackson's presidential candidacy.   Robb was briefly surrounded by Jackson supporters as he walkeddown the center aisle of the convention hall to make his speech,amid shouts of ``Jesse.''   About midway through his speech, 60 Jackson supporters beganshouting again. Robb continued speaking for a few minutes until thedissidents made their way toward the platform. By then, they weresurrounded by Robb supporters shouting the former governor's name.   ``Whoever said Democrats didn't have any life left in them?'' anobviously exasperated but still smiling Robb said. He then quitspeaking.   Saturday's floor incident came on the heels of a Friday meetingbetween Robb and Virginia leaders of Jackson's campaign. Thesession, which lasted more than an hour, was held in an effort tosettle complaints that Robb has not supported Jackson for a positionin likely nominee Michael Dukakis' White House bid.   Robb, asked what the Jackson supporters wanted him to do, said,``I'm not real certain.''   Convention delegates voted down a floor motion to open debate onallocating the party's 75 national convention delegates, 37 of whichwent to Jackson, 22 to former candidate Albert Gore Jr. and 16 toDukakis. The three-way split reflects the outcome of the SuperTuesday primary in Virginia.</TEXT></DOC>
