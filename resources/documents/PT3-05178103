According an aspect of the      present invention, a variable compression ratio device also includes a      variable compression height piston which is positionable in a plurality of      compression heights, including fully retracted, fully extended, and at      least one position therebetween. The piston has an outer section slidably      mounted on an inner section, with the inner section being attached to the      connecting rod, and with the piston further comprising means responsive to      inertia and gas pressure forces and to the hydraulic signal for      controlling the compression height. The means for generating a hydraulic      signal may comprise means for controlling the pressures of lubricating oil      provided to first and second passages within the connecting rod in      response to at least one engine operating parameter. The means responsive      to a hydraulic signal for controlling the compression height of the piston      may comprise a control valve which is rotationally positionable by the      hydraulic signal and which is translationally positionable by the piston's      outer section. </PAR><PAR>  A control valve comprising part of a system according to the present      invention may be rotationally positioned by means of a rack-geared plunger      which is responsive to a hydraulic signal. The control valve may comprise      a generally cylindrical body having a metering helix formed on its      cylindrical outer surface, with the control valve further comprising an      upper passage extending axially from the upper end of the cylindrical body      to a port formed on the surface of the cylinder below the helix, and a      lower passage extending axially from the lower end of the cylindrical body      to a port formed on the surface of the cylinder above the helix. The      control valve is slidably housed within a ported bore extending through      the inner section of the piston in a direction parallel to the axial      motion of the piston, with both ends of a control valve extending from the      bore and abutting the outer section of the piston, such that the control      valve will move axially and translationally with the piston's outer      section. </PAR><PAR>  According to another aspect of the present invention, a means responsive to      a hydraulic signal for controlling the compression height of a piston      further comprises an upper chamber extending between the top of the inner      section of the piston and the top of the outer section of the piston and a      lower chamber extending between the bottom of the inner section of the      piston and the bottom of the outer section of the piston, with the      chambers being filled with engine lubricating oil flowing through said      upper and lower passages in the control valve primarily in response to      inertia and gas pressure forces acting on the outer piston section and      according to the rotational position of the control valve. </PAR><PAR>  According to another aspect of the present invention, a control valve may      be positioned by an electrically driven motor housed within the piston's      inner section. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a plan view, partially broken away, of a piston having an      adjustable compression ratio feature according to the present invention,      taken along the line 1--1 of FIG. 2. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is a sectional view of a piston according to the present invention,      taken along the line 2--2 of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 is a partial section of the piston of FIGS. 1 and 2, taken along the      line 3--3 of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 illustrates the developed surface of a control valve, 18, embodied      in a piston according to the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 5 is a partially schematic representation of valving embodied in a      piston according to the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 is a sectional view of a valve comprising part of a system according      to the present invention, taken along the line 6--6 of FIG. 1. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate alternative methods for maintaining the lower      plate, 40, of a piston according to the present invention, in contact with      outer section 36. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 is a block diagram showing two system variations according to the      present invention. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a schematic representation of a control plunger oil feed system      according to one aspect of the present invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  As shown schematically in FIG. 9, a controller, 84, which is responsive to      at least one engine operating parameter, which may comprise engine load,      combustion chamber pressure, other parameters or combinations of      parameters, controls output of an oil pump, 88, which supplies hydraulic      fluid, which may comprise engine lubricating oil or some other type of      fluid, to a connecting rod, 16, which in turn furnishes the fluid to a      piston, 10. Alternatively, controller 84 may directly command a motor, 92,      which comprises a part of piston 10 to perform the function of operating a      control valve according to the present invention. Motor 92 may comprise      either an electric motor such as a stepper or torque motor or some other      type of motor. </PAR><PAR>  Turning now to FIG. 2, a piston 10, reciprocably mounted with an engine      cylinder, 12, is connected with the crankshaft of an engine (not shown) by      means of connecting rod 16. Hydraulic fluid, in this case, engine      lubricating oil, is provided to piston 10 via passages 20 and 21 formed in      connecting rod 16. Passages 20 and 21 may be supplied with oil via the      normal engine lubricating oil pump, with the pressure output of the pump      being controlled by means of controller 84. Oil travelling up passage 20      from the large end of connecting rod 16 passes into interior cavity 28 of      the piston's wrist pin, 22, via supply port 24. Oil leaves cavity 28 by      means of one or more exit ports 19 and flows into supply groove 26 which      is formed in the wrist pin bore. Note that the ends of cavity 28 are      sealed by means of plugs 30 and 32 so all oil reaching the interior of      wrist pin 22 must leave through exit port 18. Oil flowing through supply      groove 26 eventually ends up either in upper cavity 18, which is defined      as the cavity extending between the top of the inner section of the      piston, 44, and the lower surface of the top of the outer section of the      piston, 36, or in bore 56, which will be described in detail below. Note      that oil within upper cavity 18 will prevent the piston from becoming      fully retracted. Full retraction occurs when upper land, 42, of outer      section 36 comes in contact with the upper surface of inner section 44. </PAR><PAR>  When it is desired to increase the compression height of the piston, oil is      moved into upper cavity 18 and released from lower cavity 14 causing outer      section 36 to move upward relative to inner section 44 and wrist pin 22.      It is noted in this regard that inner section 44 is allowed only to pivot      on wrist pin 22 and does not move axially with respect to the wrist pin. </PAR><PAR>  When it is desired to reduce the compression height of the piston, oil is      admitted into lower cavity 14 and released from upper cavity 18; placing      oil in the lower cavity will cause outer section 36 of the piston to move      downwardly with respect to inner section 44 and wrist pin 22. This      reduction in compression height of piston 10 will have the effect of      reducing the compression ratio achieved by an engine using a piston and      connecting rod arrangement according to the present invention. </PAR><PAR>  The compression height of a piston according to the present invention is      determined, as noted above, by the relative volumes of oil trapped in      upper cavity 18 and lower cavity 14. The relative volumes of oil trapped      in these cavities is determined by the rotational position of control      valve 48. As best seen from FIGS. 1 and 3, the rotational position of      control valve 48 is determined by the axial location of rack-geared      control plunger 54, which is housed in a bore formed in inner section 44      of piston 10. Oil entering supply groove 26 from the interior of wrist pin      22 flows to chamber 56 and displaces control plunger 54 against the      biasing force of calibration spring 60 and the force of oil within chamber      25. Controlled oil pressure within chamber 25 arises from connecting rod      passage 21 through supply port 31 to cavity 29 within wrist pin 22 and      then through exit port 27 and into grooved channel 33. A seal, 23,      prevents the oil within passages 20 and 21 from bleeding into the      incorrect supply port 24 or 31, as the case may be. After entering grooved      channel 33, oil moves to chamber 25 (see FIG. 1). Thus, it may be seen      that the axial position of control plunger 54 depends upon the magnitude      of the hydraulic forces resulting from the pressures within chambers 56      and 25 as well as upon the force exerted by control plunger spring 60. </PAR><PAR>  As control plunger 54 is displaced axially, a series of rack teeth, 58,      forming a gear rack on control plunger 54, interact with pinion teeth 50      (FIG. 3) formed on control valve 48, thereby rotating control valve 48 to      a rotational position which corresponds to the difference between the      pressures transmitted through passages 20 and 21 in connecting rod 16. It      is the rotational position of control valve 48 which determines the      compression height of the piston. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 is a schematic representation of a hydraulic signal generating      means according to one aspect of the present invention. Beginning with the      top of FIG. 10, control plunger 54 is shown as being positionable      according to the control pressures contained within chambers 25 and 56.      The control pressures are shown schematically as being transmitted along      connecting rod passages 20 and 21. The crankshaft-connecting rod      interface, 162, includes two 180.degree. supply grooves in the connecting      rod upper bearing insert, with each groove communicating with one of      passages 20 and 21. Each of the two grooves in the upper bearing insert is      fed a separately controllable pressure by separate holes bored into the      connecting rod journal of the crankshaft. Each hole is fed by a passage      drilled up from a different main bearing journal. The crankshaft holes      feeding connecting rod 16 are located such that the 180.degree. grooves      are supplied with oil only when piston 10 is in the upper half of its      stroke. Taken together, the pressures acting in passages 20 and 21      comprise a hydraulic signal pair. </PAR><PAR>  The main bearing-crankshaft interface, 160, of FIG. 10 is intended to      provide for continuous, unrestricted oil pressure to the crankshaft's      connecting rod journals. This may be accomplished by feeding the oil      passages drilled up from the main bearing journal to the connecting rod      journal by means of 360.degree. grooves formed in the main bearing insert.      Alternatively, the main bearing inserts may be grooved so that the      crankshaft oil passage receives oil only when the 180.degree. supply      grooves in the connecting rod upper bearing inserts are indexed with the      supply holes in the crankshaft's connecting rod journals. Each of the      passages 20 and 21 will then receive pressure whenever piston 10 is on the      upper half of its stroke. Adjacent main bearing journals of the crankshaft      may be provided with different oil pressures according to this invention      and these pressures may be communicated with piston 10 via passages 20 and      21. </PAR><PAR>  The pressure regulation system shown in the lower part of FIG. 10, which is      part of oil pump 88 shown in FIG. 9, provides passage 20 with oil at a      relatively constant high pressure, such as, for example, 60 psi. Oil      enters the system shown in FIG. 10 through port 144 and flows without      restriction through passage 20 into piston 10. Passage 21 is supplied with      variable pressure in the range, for example, of 30 to 60 psi. As described      above, control plunger 54 is positioned according to the difference in      pressures supplied by passages 20 and 21. The pressure within passage 21      is controlled by controller 84, which operates spring load adjustor 156,      by means of a stepper motor, or a hydraulic motor (not shown) or by some      other similar device known to those skilled in the art and suggested by      this disclosure. Spring load adjustor 156 biases spring plunger 154, which      preloads spring 148. The force of spring 148 is exerted upon pressure      regulator plunger 144. If the load upon spring 148 is increased by spring      plunger 154 as a result of a command from controller 84, pressure      regulator plunger 144 will move to the right, thereby opening drain      passage 146. As a result, the pressure in chamber 150 and passage 21 will      decrease and plunger 144 will move to the left to further restrict drain      146 and to assume an equilibrium position If the load upon spring 148 is      reduced, plunger 144 moves to the left, thereby further opening port 140      and increasing the pressure in chamber 150 and passage 21, causing plunger      144 to move to the right to an equilibrium position. </PAR><PAR>  Each position of spring plunger 154 is marked by a unique differential      between the pressures within passages 20 and 21. In turn, these pressures      relate to a unique position for control valve 48, and ultimately, to a      unique compression height for piston 10. The novel system of the present      invention, including dual passages 20 and 21 through connecting rod 16,      compensates for inertia forces which would otherwise disrupt the control      of compression height if only a single connecting rod passage were used.      Without compensation, inertia forces acting on the oil within a single      connecting rod passage would render the oil pressure within the passage a      nullity during part of the piston's stroke, while greatly amplifying the      pressure at other parts of the piston's stroke. Inertia forces act on the      column of oil within the connecting rod such that the oil pressure is      increased during the upper half of the piston's stroke and reduced during      the lower half of the stroke. According to the present system, the inertia      forces on each of the columns of oil within passages 20 and 21 will cancel      each other during the upper half of the piston stroke because control      plunger 54 responds to the differential pressure between passages 20 and      21. During the lower half of the piston stroke, the cutoff provided by the      180.degree. grooves in crankshaft-connecting rod interface 162 will      prevent oil from leaving passages 20 and 21. </PAR><PAR>  The compression height of piston 10 results from the rotational position of      control valve 48 as follows. Beginning with FIG. 3, note that control      valve 48 extends between upper land 42 formed on outer section 36 and      lower plate 40, which is joined immovably with outer section 36.      Accordingly, control valve 48 moves translationally by reciprocating with      outer section 36 as the outer section slides relative to inner section 44,      so as to achieve a change in compression height. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 illustrates the developed surface of control valve 48. Notice that      control valve 48 has an upper passage 66, extending through control valve      48 to a lower port, 70, in the surface of the control valve (see also FIG.      5). Control valve 48 has a second lower axial passage, 74, which extends      to an upper port 76. Ports 70 and 76 are separated by a metering helix,      62, which allows the rotational position of control valve 48 to determine      the oil flow between upper cavity 18 and lower cavity 14. </PAR><PAR>  Turning now to FIGS. 1 and 5, control valve 48 is housed within a bore, 52,      formed within the piston's inner section, 44. An upward opening check      valve, 112, allows oil to enter upper cavity 18, thereby increasing the      compression height of piston 10. A downwardly opening check valve, 116,      allows oil to enter lower cavity 14, thereby decreasing the compression      height of piston 10. The oil is allowed to flow through various check      valves due to the rotational position of control valve 40 as follows. The      underlying concept of control includes the utilization of the axial forces      which act on the piston cyclically in both directions. During the      compression and power strokes of the engine, significant downward force is      exerted on the piston because of the gas pressure within the combustion      chamber. This force is counteracted by the oil in upper cavity 18. During      the later part of the exhaust stroke and during most of the intake stroke,      an upward force acts on the piston. This force is generally of a lesser      magnitude than the previously described downwardly acting force. The      upwardly acting force is supported and counteracted by the oil trapped in      lower cavity 14. </PAR><PAR>  The function of control valve 48 is to allow oil to flow into one of the      upper or lower cavities until the required compression height is achieved,      at which time valve 48 shuts off the oil flow automatically. This      operation can be understood with reference to FIGS. 4 and 5. More      specifically, when metering helix 62 is positioned so as to block the flow      into metering passage, 80, oil cannot flow through either of check valves      112 or 116, or for that matter, check valve 120, and the piston will be      hydraulically locked at a given compression height. If controller 84      signals oil pump 88 to increase the pressure in cavity 25 operating on      control plunger 54, the control plunger will move to the right, causing      control valve 48 to rotate counterclockwise as viewed from the top in FIG.      1. As a result, upper port 76, which is maintained in fluid contact with      lower passage 74, will be connected with metering passage 80, and oil will      be allowed to flow from lower cavity 14 through lower passage 74 and      metering passage 80 and past check valve 112 into upper cavity 118. Check      valve 112 prevents oil flow in the reverse direction. In response to the      oil flow into upper cavity 118, the compression height of the piston will      be increased until a point is reached at which metering helix 62 once      again covers metering passage 80, at which time the compression height      will be hydrostatically locked. If, on the other hand, the pressure signal      is decreased by controller 84, decreased pressure acting upon control      plunger 54 in cavity 25 will cause control valve 48 to rotate clockwise,      as viewed from the top in FIG. 1, thereby placing lower port 70 in fluid      contact with metering passage 80, and thereby allowing fluid to flow from      upper cavity 18 through upper passage 66, through lower port 70 and then      through check valve 116 into lower cavity 14. This will cause the      compression height of the piston to be reduced until a point is reached at      which metering helix 62 once again covers metering passage 80, at which      time the compression height will again be hydrostatically locked. </PAR><PAR>  Because the cross-sectional area of upper cavity 18 greatly exceeds that of      lower cavity 14, check valve 120 allows surplus oil to be discharged      through port 124 and into cavity 34 and through channel 128 into the      crankcase of the engine, when the compression height of the piston is      reduced (see FIGS. 1 and 2). On the other hand, when the compression      height is increased, the volume of oil trapped in lower cavity 14 will      always be insufficient to achieve the desired volume change in upper      cavity 18. Because this is the case, additional oil will be admitted into      upper cavity 18 by means of oil replenishment check valve 136 (see FIGS. 1      and 6). In addition to obviating problems resulting from oil sludging      resulting from stagnation, this arrangement provides for a biasing oil      pressure in the upward direction, which is advantageous because it      accelerates the upward movement of the piston. Notwithstanding that seals      may be used on the various moving parts of a system according to this      invention, oil leakage may occur. This may cause oil to be lost from the      upper and lower cavities. Any such loss will, whenever, automatically be      replenished through oil replenishment check valve 136. Although valve 136      feeds only the upper cavity 18, this is not a problem because if oil is      lost from lower cavity 14, the compression height will gradually increase.      When this happens, control valve 48 will move upward relative to inner      section 44, and lower port 70 will be connected to metering passage 80. As      a result, oil will be caused by gas and inertia forces acting on outer      piston section 36 to flow to lower cavity 14 and the compression height      will be brought back to the desired value. </PAR><PAR>  A system according to the present invention allows the compression height      of the piston to be adjusted to any position in between the fully      retracted and fully extended positions. Those skilled in the art will      appreciate in view of this disclosure that merely by changing the      differential pressure acting upon control plunger 54, a precise rotational      position for control valve 48 may be selected and, as a consequence, the      control valve will determine the precise positioning of outer section 36      with respect to inner section 44 and connecting rod 16. Accordingly, a      system according to the present invention will produce an infinitely      variable compression height so as to allow the effective compression ratio      of the engine to be altered according to the operating needs of the      engine. </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 7 and 8 illustrate alternative means for securing lower plate 40 to      outer section 36. As shown in FIG. 2, a first embodiment includes a weld,      96, imposed between the lower plate and outer section. FIG. 6 illustrates      a radial pin, 100, which mechanically fastens the lower plate and outer      section. FIG. 8 illustrates a threaded connection, 104, between the lower      plate and outer section. </PAR><PAR>  As shown schematically in FIG. 9, a motor, 92 may be substituted for      control plunger 54 and the passages leading thereto. Motor 92 will      position control valve 48 to the rotational location corresponding to the      desired compression height. Such a motor could comprise an electrically      driven unit such as a torque or stepper motor. Those skilled in the art      will appreciate in view of this disclosure that controller 84 could      communicate with motor 92 by means of high frequency electromagnetic      emissions, or by more prosaic devices such as sliding electrical contacts      or by yet other devices. In any case, the signal characteristic which is      indicative of the desired compression height may be the amplitude or      frequency of the transmitted signal, or some other appropriate      characteristic. The use of a motor instead of a control plunger will      obviate the need for two separate oil passages in connecting rod 16,      because such a motor will operate essentially independently of the inertia      forces which must be balanced in the case of a hydraulically actuated      control valve. Accordingly, only a single oil passage will be required. </PAR><PAR>  Although the invention has been described with reference to illustrated      embodiments, it should be understood that numerous changes may be made      within the spirit and scope of the inventive concepts described.      Accordingly, it is intended that the invention not be limited to the      illustrated embodiments, but that it have the full scope permitted by the      language of the following claims. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
