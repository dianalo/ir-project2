(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A cable television company is asking itsCinemax subscribers whether they want the cable company to blackoutthe scheduled showing next month of the movie ``The Last Temptationof Christ.''   When the movie was released last year, many fundamentalistreligious groups objected, with mass demonstrations and picketing oftheaters where it was shown. In North Dakota, the movie was onlyshown in Fargo.   Because of that controversy, Bismarck-Mandan Cable TV sent its1,800 Cinemax subscribers a letter saying it is considering blackingout the five showings of the film in October.   The company also sent subscribers a card with two boxes to check_ a box in favor of the blackout and a box against it.   ``As we examined it, we said it looks like a no-win situation,''said Jay O. ``Jot'' Turner, manager of the cable company. ``If weaired the movie there will probably be a lot of protests like lastyear in the theaters. And if we censor the movie or blackout therewould be a lot of protests from people saying you shouldn't dothat.''   Turner said he will have an announce the results of the ballotingon Wednesday.   A spokesman for Home Box Office, parent company of Cinemax, whoasked not to be identified said he didn't want to comment on themovie but said the company's general policy is that HBO and Cinemaxhave the final say over programming. Local cable operators do nothave the right to blackout the movies, he said.   Turner said Bismarck-Mandan Cable TV's contract allows it. ``Wedo have a clause in there which says that we can make a decision ifthere's some programming we feel is not proper to communitystandards, we would have the right to black it out,'' he said.   Turner said that clause is used only as a last resort and addedthe cable company has never exercised that option.</TEXT></DOC>
