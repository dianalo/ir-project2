Mitchell, D-Maine, said Wednesday that a refusal by Bush toaccept a boost in the income tax rates paid by the richestwage-earners would kill any budget deal that involves slashedcapital gains levies.   ``There are certain points beyond which you can't go,'' Mitchellsaid.   The majority leader's comments to reporters came ascongressional leaders and White House officials continued talks onhow to slice next year's budget deficit, which is expected tosurpass $160 billion.   The bargainers discussed ways to save at least $10 billion bycutting benefit programs such as Medicare but reached noagreements. The two sides planned to hold separate strategysessions today and to resume negotiations Friday.   Many congressional Republicans have insisted that the presidentwill never accept an increase in income tax rates for the richestAmericans, despite his recent easing of the anti-tax stance he tookduring his 1988 election campaign.   But Mitchell said swapping one for the other was a matter ofequity.   ``In the past decade, the federal tax system has becomeincreasingly regressive,'' he said. ``The middle class in oursociety ... those are the people who are paying increasingly, whoare shouldering the burden of taxation in our society.   ``I don't see how anyone in good conscience can further thattrend,'' he said.   Under current law, income tax rates rise to 33 percent in theupper-middle income bracket and then drop back to 28 percent forthe additional earnings of the most wealthy Americans. Capitalgains income _ earnings derived from the sale of assets such asstocks and real estate _ is taxed at those same rates.   Bush has been pushing to cut the capital gains rate to 15percent, arguing it would spur investment and economic growth.Mitchell and other Democrats oppose the change because the wealthywould benefit disproportionately.   A frequently discussed compromise is to simultaneously cut thecapital gains rate and eliminate the drop in the income tax ratefor the richest taxpayers. Mitchell's comments Wednesday reflectedhis willingness to consider such a tradeoff.   Mitchell said that at a minimum the top marginal tax rate shouldbe raised to 33 percent, and he personally favored 35 percent.Anything less than 33 percent would be ``completely unacceptable,''he said.</TEXT></DOC>
