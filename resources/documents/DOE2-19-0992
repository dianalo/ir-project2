The parameters determining flame front fold-over and interruptionare investigated by varying the nozzle diameter, the initial velocityand the initial turbulence. The temperature field, flow field and turbulencefield are investigated by different methods, and a model is developedwhich describes the influencing parameters. (HAG).</TEXT></DOC>
