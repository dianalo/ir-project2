There was no independent confirmation.   Baghland City, the provincial capital, has been under siege forweeks. Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, chairman of the seven-party Moslemguerrilla alliance, saids the city's collapse would be a coup forhis fighters.   Agency Afghan Press, a private-run Pakistani news service,claimed more than 100 Soviets and 15 guerrillas were killed on theSalang Highway when the anti-Marxist guerrillas repulsed an attackon their headquarters near the city on May 27.   Departing Soviet troops travel the Salang Highway, the only roadout of Afghanistan's capital city of Kabul north to the Soviet Union.   A strategic northern city would also give the U.S.-backedguerrillas a stronghold should speculation prove true that AfghanPresident Najib is eyeing the north as a possible refuge if Kabul isoverrun.   Meanwhile, official Radio Kabul broadcasts have been playing upguerrilla activities since May 15, the official start of the Sovietwithdrawal under a United Nations-sponsored peace accord. Priorbroadcasts virtually ignored guerrilla exploits.   The radio, monitored in Islamabad, claimed late Sunday thattroops overran three guerrilla groups in southeastern Zabul andKandahar provinces and in northwestern Faryab province.   Guerrilla commanders have been preparing for a major offensive onthe major city of Kandahar. According to Agency Afghan Press,villages to the southwest of Kandahar City have been heavily bombed.   Soviet forces invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and replaced oneMarxist government with another. It began withdrawing its more than100,000 troops on May 15 after signing the April peace accord inGeneva.</TEXT></DOC>
