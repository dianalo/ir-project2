But you wouldn't know it from the agonized shrieks coming from one of the dressing rooms: &quot;YEEEEEH. YEEEEH. . . .&quot; &quot;Resonance. I'm building resonance, fine-tuning the voice so it won't go woofy during the performance,&quot; explains the source of these seemingly extraterrestrial caterwauls. Her name is Joyce Castle, and she is no alien. But, all made-up and ready to sing, this Kansas-bred mezzo looks even worse than she sounds warming up.    Homeless birds would love the singer's disheveled gray wig. Blackened teeth fill that open mouth. Her skin is a field of penciled furrows. This is not a face to launch a thousand ships. But in a few minutes she will steal the show as Madame d'Urfe, a loony old alchemist. Bobbing up and down in a gondola during a storm, she will raise her scrawny arms above her head and, in a penetrating voice, implore Casanova to transform her into a male infant. She will catch pneumonia instead. He will get her jewels. The audience will laugh.    Wide and deep experience enriches Ms. Castle's portrait-years of experience singing other biddies -- and bats -- in this same house. Last season, she hobbled through Leonard Bernstein's &quot;Candide&quot; as the old lady with one big buttock and won a Grammy award for the recording on the New World label. More recently, she's been seen here in the minor role of the old lady with one dumb son in &quot;Cavalleria Rusticana.&quot; Ms. Castle was so compelling holding her dish rag, her reviews were better than the singer who starred as Santuzza.    But as d'Urfe, Ms. Castle's onstage for a whole act, and she is eager to get going. &quot;WHEEEARG. Finally, a golden role, a big sing,&quot; she says, as she completes her alchemist outfit by donning a leather apron and a matching leather hat. Tossing off some diet soda, she heads for d'Urfe's ovens: &quot;See you later.&quot;    Later is at a Chinese restaurant where Ms. Castle picks apart a dumpling she didn't ask for. As Mrs. Lovett in &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; she has spent too many evenings baking pies with bits and pieces of people inside not to be a suspicious eater of other people's stuffed pastries. &quot;Never eat pies anymore. Not even tiny ones,&quot; she croons pleasantly, reaching for something else. After a long scrub in the dressing room, the attractive, green-eyed mezzo now looks a lot like a normal human being with a lot of red hair.    In a few weeks, though, that firmly chiseled chin will sprout a luxurious black beard. City Opera is reviving Stravinsky's &quot;The Rake's Progress&quot; and Ms. Castle will be Baba the Turk, the chatty show-biz freak whose astonishing beard has brought her admirers the world over. But alas, Tom Rakewell, who marries her on a whim, is not among them. He puts his wig on her face to shut her up in mid-aria and proceeds to lose her fortune.    &quot;I specialize in special cases,&quot; Ms. Castle says, &quot;nuts, mammas, lesbians, nymphomaniacs, witches and men.&quot;    This is not the glamour repertoire Ms. Castle dreamed about growing up in Baldwin, Kan., or as a student at the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, N.Y. &quot;I wanted to be a diva,&quot; she admits, and in the late 1970s, she moved to Paris to see what she could do about that. For six years she sang with Radio France. The few times she left her microphone it was to perform with an avant-garde music theater company in Frankfurt. With this kind of exposure, turning into a diva proved to be as easy as turning into a male infant.    &quot;I sing a wonderful Charlotte,&quot; she insists, referring to Werther's soul mate in the Massenet opera every juicy mezzo wants to sing. &quot;But nobody ever asked me. Not even when I was 25. Maybe it's my countenance.&quot; (The nose will require the least make-up when she sings Humperdinck's witch in &quot;Hansel and Gretel&quot; at the Houston Grand Opera this December.) &quot;Maybe it's my height. But what can you do about that, though I did read an interesting piece in the papers about a very tall woman who wanted to be shorter and had a surgeon take out bones in her legs. Then her hands hung down to her knees.&quot;    Ms. Castle, who is a thin 5 feet 10, stays abreast of such news by reading lurid tabloids at a supermarket on New York's Upper West Side. She moved there from Paris last year: &quot;I divorced my, must I tell you, yes it's true, second husband, but who's counting, and decided to come back to the States. But six years abroad is a long time and nobody knew me.&quot;    She got busy. Auditioning for Hal Prince landed her at Houston's Grand in 1984 baking those horrible pies for the first time. The Metropolitan Opera signed her up to wear a breastplate and produce &quot;hojotohos&quot; as one of the Valkyries in last year's &quot;Die Walkure&quot; production and let her pluck a goose as the innkeeper in &quot;Boris Godunov&quot; when another mezzo died. Along the way, Beverly Sills, City's general director, had stuck her with Olga in &quot;Merry Widow.&quot;    &quot;The woman doesn't sing,&quot; recalls Ms. Castle. &quot;It was a sad moment in my career.&quot; But the world turned brighter soon, when Ms. Sills started tossing her one eccentric part after another. These days, Ms. Castle has few rivals as a character singer. Just watching her snoot around as the cruel stepmother in Massenet's &quot;Cendrillon&quot; will make you lose your shoes. (Washingtonians can watch her oppress Frederica von Stade as Cinderella in February at the Kennedy Center).    Now in her early 40s, Ms. Castle has come to realize that glamour roles like the princess Amneris aren't always the most interesting. &quot;The characters I do are handsome in their own way. Baba is so proud. Others are engaged in life and death issues. Madame d'Urfe . . . I love that woman. Yes, she's been in the lab too long. But the commitment, the vulnerability. She is very moving despite her grotesqueness. And to bring that out is challenging.&quot;    And not limiting. Neither is being Ms. Castle. She reckons her repertoire now encompasses some 70 roles, including two big Strauss mammas she has yet to perform onstage: Klytemnestra in &quot;Elektra&quot; and Herodias in &quot;Salome.&quot; She sings some 75 performances a year. Like Baba, Ms. Castle isn't waiting around and worrying. When, at the end of the &quot;Rake's&quot; progress, the bearded one is asked where she will go and what she will do, Baba bats not an eye. &quot;My dear,&quot; she says. &quot;A gifted lady never need have fear.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
