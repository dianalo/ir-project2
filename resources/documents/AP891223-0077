The Immigration Reform and Control Act of late 1986 was supposedto allow illegal aliens to enter the mainstream of American lifewhile also stemming the rising tide of illegal immigration acrossthe nation's southern border.   Critics say the landmark legislation has only partiallysucceeded in slowing the influx of aliens and has done little toimprove the lives of many alreading living here.   Congress and the administration, these critics say, also haveturned their backs on a host of new problems.   ``The '80s was a period of great promise that was never met; agreat promise that failed,'' said Dan Stein, executive director ofthe Federation for American Immigration Reform. ``Americans lookeddown the barrel of huge increases in immigration and failed to takethe steps needed to fix the system.''   Hispanic rights organizations said the legislation, which barsemployers from hiring undocumented aliens, has created anunderclass of people desperate for jobs but vulnerable to employerswho pay subminimum wages and require workers to perform hazardoustasks.   At the same time, significant numbers of employers wary aboutsanctions for breaking the new law are discriminating againstforeign-born or foreign-sounding job applicants, the activistsclaim.   And Congress and the administration have yet to make good ontheir promise to increase the ranks of the Border Patrol by 50percent. Before the bill's enactment there were 3,700 Border Patrolagents; today there are 3,800 on duty, according to the Immigrationand Naturalization Service.   The Border Patrol also has been thrown into the war on drugs andother missions that divert its attention from patrolling theborder, said Rep. Bruce Morrison, D-Conn., chairman of the HouseJudiciary subcommittee on immigration, refugees and internationallaw.   ``It was, overall, an enforcement failure,'' Stein said. ``TheINS and the Border Patrol have known what needs to be done yet theadministration has never put pressure on Congress to give us arespectable level of border funding.''   The reforms, however, appear to have succeeded _ at leastinitially _ in slowing the number of aliens crossing the Southwestborder illegally.   Apprehensions of these illegal aliens _ considered the bestindicator of illegal immigration _ fell from 1.6 million in theyear before the bill's passage to 854,939 in fiscal 1989.Apprehensions, however, have begun creeping up again, officials say.   The bill also has succeeded in touching the lives of 3.1 millionpeople who were in the country illegally prior to its passage, butwho are now eligible to become citizens through its amnestyprovisions.   ``One in every 100 residents (of the country) has beentouched,'' said Michael Fix, a senior research associate at theUrban Institute, a Washington think tank. ``The scale is stunningand the kind of money spent and the impact on society over the longrun is just stunning. This is a one-time program of the size of thewar on poverty _ a big social deal and I don't think the dimensionsare really appreciated.''   But activists say the amnesty provisions split families, withone spouse allowed to remain here legally and another unqualifiedto apply for residency. Immigration reformers complain thatCongress failed to prepare for the clamor of relatives who surelywill follow.   ``The failure to reform legal immigration (which favorslegalization of family members of new residents) will meanunprecedented political pressure to admit millions more immigrantswhen there's not general public support for it,'' Stein said.   But Mario Moreno, director of the Washington office of theMexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, said Congresscould have helped far more people achieve residency through moreliberal amnesty standards.   At the same time, those who don't qualify are ``outside the loopof any sort of safety net,'' he said. ``There have been reports ofpeople being taken advantage of, of being exploited.''   Some have taken such hazardous jobs as improperly managedasbestos removal or working with toxic wastes, Moreno said.   Jose Garcia De Lara, national president of the League of UnitedLatin American Citizens, said he has heard of illegal aliens doinghazardous construction or agricultural work, or being forced intocrime.   ``They're certainly an unprotected people,'' he said, and aslong as there is political and economic turmoil to the south of theRio Grande, Mexicans, Central and South Americans will continue totry to enter the country illegally.   ``Congress passed the bill and turned its back,'' De Lara said.``Congress should roll up its sleeves and do a major overhaul ofIRCA and include an initiative to help the countries south of ourborder.''   Added Moreno: ``The unabated flow of aliens is not going to bestopped by employer sanctions.''   Activists complain those sanctions, however, are responsible foremployer discrimination against foreign-looking andforeign-sounding job seekers.   ``It's a very real, powerful problem,'' said Fix. ``While it maybe IRCA related, it's not just an IRCA problem. A lot ofdiscrimination predated IRCA.''   De Lara said the Office of Special Counsel within the JusticeDepartment has done ``almost nil'' to enforce the law'santi-discrimination provisions.   Rep. John Bryant, D-Texas, a member of the immigrationsubcommittee, agreed the administration has ``refused to takeseriously the obligation to enforce the anti-discriminationprovisions in the bill. They don't have the people to enforce it.''   But Rep. Lamar Smith of Texas, the ranking Republican on theimmigration panel, said he's seen little evidence of discrimination.   ``There have only been a dozen or so proven cases ofdiscrimination because of employer sanctions and this despite thefact that a number of organizations have spent a lot of time tryingto come up with examples of discrimination,'' said Smith.   INS spokesman Verne Jervis also said discrimination does notappear to be severe.   Enforcement of employer sanctions, however, has fallen short inSmith's view.   ``Until we vigorously enforce employer sanctions, we are notgoing to significantly stem the flood of illegal aliens enteringthe United States. I'm hoping we will see more enforcement, and theimposition of more penalties, in the future,'' Smith said.   C</TEXT></DOC>
