SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Schools, museums, librarians, prominentpoliticians and even a television quiz show are teaming up this weekto draw attention to the need to know where we _ and others _ are.   A variety of programs are planned for ``Geography AwarenessWeek'' in the United States, a land of people who came from otherplaces.   ``Without geographically literate citizens, America cannotcompete in global markets or take the lead in meeting internationalpolitical, economic, environmental, social and militarychallenges,'' said Gilbert M. Grosvenor, president of the NationalGeographic Society.   Yet Americans' ignorance is illustrated by a recent Gallup surveywhich found that 18- to 24-year-old Americans know less about worldgeography than residents of other nations do.   _Less than half could find Central America on a map.   _Only one in three could locate Vietnam.   _Just one-quarter could find the Persian Gulf.   _And when asked to locate New York state on a map, respondentspicked 37 different places across the nation.   ``Continued ignorance of geography, other cultures, and foreignlanguages places the United States at a disadvantage in matters ofbusiness, politics and the environment,'' says Sen. Bill Bradley,D-N.J.   How to solve the problem?   The National Geographic Society, the Association of AmericanGeographers, educators, librarians and others are giving it a try.   Perhaps with the potential to reach the most people quickly isthe quiz show ``Jeopardy,'' which will include special geographycategories during the week.   National Geographic Society head Grosvenor and U.S. EducationSecretary Lauro F. Cavazos will teach a geography class in Dallas,Texas. Several state governors will serve as honorary teachersduring the week.   In many cities, weathercasters will include a bit of extrageography in their broadcasts during the week, as well as lecturingin local schools.   Grosvenor also announced that his society will donate a copy ofits new Historical Atlas of the United States to every school in thenation with a ninth grade or higher.   The Census Bureau, which spends lots of time worrying about wherepeople are, will send workers to a dozen or more schools in theWashington area to make classroom presentations on maps andlocations.   The geography of environmental hazards will be the focus oflectures at Western Washington University in Bellingham, theUniversity of Maryland in College Park, Villanova University, inVillanova, Pa., Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. and others.   At George Mason University in Virginia, the geography of thespread of the disease AIDS will be reported by geographer William B.Wood of the State Department.   T-shirts celebrating the week will be on sale from the GeographyClub at the University of Nebraska-Omaha and by students atAppalachian State University in Boone, N.C.   At Montana State University in Bozeman a ``bake sale ofgeographic delights'' is planned, while a high school in Louisville,Ky., has created cookie cutters in the shape of states and will holda decorating contest to add appropriate topographic features.   Science will make room for the arts also, as students at BallState in Muncie, Ind., explore the ``geographical perspectives ofbluegrass music,'' and the Texas Alliance for Geographic Educationholds a statewide poster contest with judging scheduled at SouthwestTexas State in San Marcos.</TEXT></DOC>
