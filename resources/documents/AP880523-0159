Four percent of the stream mileage sampled in 1985 and 1986 inmid-Atlantic areas was acidic and showed chemical characteristicsthat made it unlikely all the acidity could have come from naturalsources, the study concluded. On forested ridges inland fromcoastal lowlands, the proportion reached 10 percent.   ``The lack of plausible sources of neutral salts in thesestreams makes it likely'' that their acidity is ``probablyassociated with atmospheric acid deposition,'' said the study madeavailable by the agency on Monday.   More than a quarter of the stream mileage showing these chemicalcharacteristics in EPA's study of eastern streams was outside themid-Atlantic, but most of that was in Florida where streams areoften naturally acidic. There was practically no such mileage inthe Southeast or the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas and Oklahoma.   Courtney Riordan, head of acid rain research for EPA, said thenew findings show there has been ``an expansion of the geographicarea'' known to be influenced by acid rain.   What the study could not show is definite proof that acid rainhas acidified the streams in question, how fast stream acidity andacid-neutralizing ability is changing or when it is likely thewatershed no longer will be able to neutralize the aciditynaturally. EPA hopes to be able to answer such questions next year.   The mid-Atlantic area in the study was made up of rural areas ofmost of Virginia and Pennsylvania, all of Maryland, Delaware andNew Jersey, the eastern half of West Virginia and the CatskillMountains of New York.   An acidic stream was defined as one that had lost all ability toneutralize further inputs of acidity.   Some of the heaviest deposition of acidity in rain and snow wasfound in southern and southwestern Pennsylvania, northeastern WestVirginia and the Maryland panhandle.   These areas and their robust soils, believed to have plenty ofability to neutralize acid rain, have not attracted the attentionof areas with somewhat less acidity in the rain but more vulnerablewatersheds like parts of New England, the Adirondack Mountains ofNew York and eastern Canada.   Most of the acidity in rain, snow and fog in the area isbelieved to originate in emissions from smokestacks of coal-firedpower plants in the area and also upwind in the Midwest. Sulfurdioxide in the smokestack gases is transformed in the atmosphereinto sulfuric acid which is washed out in precipitation.   The more acidic the water, the less fish life it can support,and too much acidity means no fish can live there _ whatenvironmentalists say has happened in many lakes in the Northeastand eastern Canada.   There are several sources of sulfates, and the sampling schemeexcluded streams that were likely to have been influenced bysources in urban pollution or mine runoff.   About one-third of the 4 percent of stream mileage in question``had chemistry influenced but not dominated'' by organic compoundsoriginating in the soil, and most of these stream segments werelocated in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey or were headwaters ofstreams in the relatively flat glaciated soils of Pennsylvania andNew York.   ``Historic data suggests that streams in the Pine Barrens mayhave been naturally acidic at least since the early 1900s,'' thestudy said. ``There is no reason, however, to believe that most ofthe upland forested reaches have always been acidic.''   Overall, the study concluded that 2.7 percent of the streammileage sampled was acidic, including 12 percent of the Floridastreams.</TEXT></DOC>
