McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Business inventories jumped 0.7 percent inJuly, the biggest pileup in a year, while sales slumped 0.5percent, the government said Monday, causing some apprehension overthe amount of goods held on shelves and back lots.   Although the level of inventories is not recessionary, RobertBrusca, chief financial economist at Nikko Securities Co.International Inc. in New York, said surging stockpiles are adanger sign.   ``When inventories rise faster than sales, particularly whensales are in a lagging mode, it's reasonable to assume you're goingto see cutbacks in manufacturing output,'' he said. That couldresult in growing unemployment.   The Commerce Department said inventories in July totaled aseasonally adjusted $801.9 billion, up from $796.5 billion in June.It was the biggest increase since a 0.8 percent gain in July 1989.   The June backlog had declined a revised 0.5 percent from theprevious month, rather than the 0.4 percent originally reported.   Sales, meanwhile, dropped to a seasonally adjusted $539.5billion, down from $542.4 billion a month earlier. The June salesalso were revised to a weaker 0.6 percent gain, rather than the 1.0percent advance first reported.   Cynthia Latta, an economist with DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington,Mass., noted that sales rose only on the retail level in July butpointed out that retail sales deteriorated in August, falling 0.6percent, according to a Commerce Department report last week.   And while retail sales increased 0.4 percent in July, the gainwas less than half of the 1.1 percent jump the previous month.Retail sales represent about half of all consumer spending whichitself accounts for two-thirds of the nation's economic activity.   The combination of falling sales and rising inventories produceda 1.49 ratio of inventories to sales, up from 1.47 in June and thesame as May's 1.49. The ratio means it would take 1.49 months toexhaust the backlog of goods at the July sales pace.   Neither Brusca nor Ms. Latta believe the ratio is dangerouslyhigh.   ``But with evidence that retail selling is weak and that outputis falling, to have inventories building is not a good sign for theeconomy,'' Brusca said.   All major business categories experienced gains in inventories.Manufacturing backlogs were up 0.7 percent to $373.3 billion.Wholesalers posted a 0.5 percent gain to $192.2 billion. Retailersregistered a 0.8 percent advance to $236.5 billion.   Manufacturing sales, meanwhile, declined 0.8 percent to $237.5billion, while wholesalers posted a 1.0 percent drop to $152.0billion. Retail sales totaled $150.0 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
