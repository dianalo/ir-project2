The study has obvious political importance,since the chairman of the committee, Dan Rostenkowski (D.,Ill.), has proposed a tax increase of nearly 18% on thehighest-bracket taxpayers. And Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan(D., N.Y.) has also proposed cutting Social Security taxes.   Robin Hoods in the press quickly focused on a themeimplicit in the report: that the poor are worse off thanbefore and the rich better off. But there are some problemswith the statistics on which this assertion is based. Inparticular, the report understates the income of the poor,and so overestimates their tax rate; it overstates theincrease in the incomes of wealthy Americans, and sounderstates their tax rate.</LP><TEXT>   The slanting starts with the portrait of America's poor.The press paid a lot of attention to the &quot;news&quot; that manylow-income families now pay more of their income in SocialSecurity taxes than in income taxes, as though that weresomehow scandalous. Yet Social Security taxes are larger thanincome taxes for the working poor only because many of thepoor pay no income tax at all] This is thanks to an expandedearned-income tax credit and doubled personal exemption, bothReagan administration changes.   In any case, those in the bottom fifth of the incomedistribution range as a whole could not be badly damaged bySocial Security taxes, since the Congressional Budget Officecalculates that only 16% of them hold full-time jobs allyear. Even the Ways and Means study shows that half thetaxpayers &quot;earning&quot; less than $10,000 a year paid no SocialSecurity tax, for the obvious reason that they did not work.   The study also assumes that half of the corporate profitstax is borne by consumers, in the form of higher prices. Thestudy concludes that corporate taxes account for 11% of allthe taxes supposedly paid by the poorest fifth of thepopulation, but only 10% for the richest fifth. Thisarbitrary assumption ignores competitive restraints onbusiness; if a business passed along as much of the costs ofthe tax to consumers as the study assumes, it would priceitself out of the market. If the assumption made sense, somepolitician would surely be proposing to slash corporate taxesas a way to alleviate tax burdens on the poor.   The Ways and Means study has another big problem. Itsimply excludes 2.4 million people in &quot;families with negativeor zero incomes.&quot; As there were 500,000 more families in thatseemingly awful situation in 1980 than in 1990, excludingthem means the number of families remaining in the poorestfifth appears to increase faster than the rest of thepopulation, by 12.5% rather than 10.9%. This illusion of afaster increase in the number of &quot;poor&quot; families reduces themeasured growth of income per family.   This raises the question, though, of how 2.4 millionfamily members could possibly survive with a zero or negativeincome. One way is by receiving in-kind benefits, such asfood stamps and public housing. Another is by receiving cashbenefits, such as the earned-income tax credit.   In the Ways and Means study, however, in-kind benefitsdon't count at all, and any cash benefits that are countedare apparently just treated as a &quot;negative tax&quot; rather thanas income. The estimated individual income tax rate for thosewho have jobs (and pay Social Security tax) in the bottomfifth is minus 2.3%. That is, rather than saying that someonewho makes $1,000 has $1,023 of income, after receiving cashfrom the government, the study says his income is $1,000 buthis tax rate is minus 2.3%.   It is also well known that much of the income that iscounted among the 18% of the households remaining in the&quot;bottom fifth&quot; is vastly understated. Census Bureau surveysacknowledge that about a fourth of the income from pensionsand from Aid to Families with Dependent Children is routinelyunreported. Since all in-kind benefits and many cash benefitsare not counted as income, Social Security, excise andcorporate tax rates on the bottom fifth of the populationappear larger than they really are. To pay excise taxes ashigh as estimated by this study, for example, the poor wouldhave to devote a huge share of their budgets to liquor,tobacco and gasoline. That would be quite impossible withouteither uncounted cash subsidies or uncounted in-kind aid thatfrees up cash that otherwise would be needed for necessities.   Nearly all of the exaggerated increase in tax rates amongthe lowest fifth is concentrated among &quot;non-elderlyhouseholds without children.&quot; Although the study repeatedlyrefers to &quot;families,&quot; these &quot;non-elderly households&quot; consistmainly of young single people, some of them students, andmany with uncounted financial help from their parents.   Mr. Rostenkowski's report has also served as the basis fora second major complaint: that the rich have become richer,while their tax burden has been shifted to the poor. &quot;For thelowest 20% of the population,&quot; claims the study, &quot;real incomefell by 3.2% {from 1980 to 1990}, while the total federal taxrate rose by 16.1%. By contrast, for the highest 20% of thepopulation, real income rose by 31.7%, while the totalfederal tax rate fell by 5.5%.&quot;   In reality, this grossly overstates the increase inincomes of the most affluent fifth of families, andunderstates their tax rate. One &quot;trick&quot; here is that capitalgains are included as income in the year during which assetsare sold. This vastly exaggerates regular income, becausehomes and lifetime savings are often sold in large lumps onlyonce or twice in a lifetime, particularly at retirement. Suchone-time capital gains surely account for the study's findingthat the number of elderly households in the most affluenttwo-fifths of the population supposedly increased by anastounding 46.4% during the bull market of the 1980s.   Yet counting one-time gains from the sale of assets asregular income (while also excluding rental losses) is notnearly sufficient to account for the estimate that realincome is &quot;expected to rise by 31.7 percent&quot; before taxes forthe highest fifth. Instead, what mainly accounts for theillusion of such a huge income gain is that the Ways andMeans study adopts a bizarre, purely relative definition ofreal income. Estimated income in the top fifth, it argues,rose from 8.6 times the poverty level in 1980 to 11.3 timesthe poverty level in 1990. The difference between 8.6 and11.3 equals 31.7%. That is, people in the most affluent fifthof the population are 31.7% better-off relative to povertythan they were in 1980. By that same standard, though, theentire population was likewise 18.7% better-off.   With average income up 18.7% -- relative to the povertylevel -- and the top fifth up 31.7%, the top fifth mightnonetheless be said to have beaten the average by 13percentage points. Yet this too does not mean what so manypoliticians think it means. It is not that incomes forone-fifth of the families have risen about 13% more thanaverage (much less 31.7%), but rather that so many familiesare now earning so much more money that it now takes a 13%higher real income to be counted among the top 20%.   The percentage of families earning more than $50,000, in1987 dollars, soared from 17.5% in 1980 to 22.9% in 1987. Itis obviously impossible to stuff 22.9% of all families intothe &quot;top 20 percent.&quot; So, the amount of income needed toreach the &quot;top 20 percent&quot; had to be raised from $47,609 in1980 (in 1987 dollars) to $52,910 in 1987. Since the incomesof those earning between $47,609 and $52,910 were no longercounted among the &quot;top 20 percent,&quot; incomes of thoseremaining in that top group were obviously higher -- bydefinition -- since the average was no longer diluted byincomes below $52,910. It is not that &quot;the rich are gettingricher,&quot; but that so many couples have surpassed a level thatused to be called &quot;rich&quot; that they cannot all fit within thetop fifth.   Despite the interpretation many have given reports likethis one, the truth is that the share of all federal taxescarried by the most affluent fifth of taxpayers isnonetheless estimated to have increased from 55.7% to 58.1%since 1980, while the estimated burden on the poorest fifthremained unchanged at a trivial 1.6%. Only in the topsy-turvyworld of Washington, where the worst numbers are the bestpolitical weapons, could it be considered &quot;unfair&quot; to liftmore and more families above what was once the &quot;middleclass,&quot; so that they could afford to pay a larger share oftaxes.   ---   Mr. Reynolds is director of economic research at theHudson Institute in Indianapolis.</TEXT></DOC>
