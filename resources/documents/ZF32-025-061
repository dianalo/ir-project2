 Cintech'sCinphonyandM;Cintech's (Cincinnati, OH) Cinphony ACD is perhaps the most successfulproduct to emerge from Northern Telecom's Norstar development program.andP;  Acombination of software and DOS-based hardware, Cinphony brings comprehensiveACD capabilities to even very modest centers.andP;  It also serves as a platformfor integrating other components, such as auto attendants and verticalapplication software.andM;Cinphony delivers a full ranger of high-end ACD features.andP;  It providesadvanced  call routing, true real-time status screens and managementreporting to  call centers with 30 or fewer logged-in agents.andP;  Cinphony hasgiven small companies a unique opportunity to venture into call centeroperations a virtual fiscal impossibility before.andM;Flexible options include sophisticated overflow, two routing tables pergroup, automatic logout of an agent if a call is not responded to within auser-defined time and call categorization to classify calls by type.andP;  Agentsare also able to log into multiple groups.andM;Cincinnati Milacron, a machine tool  business,  has  used  theNot-star/Cinphony ACD solution for their service parts division.andP;  The centerreceives phone orders from throughout the US and Canada.andP;  It sells parts forany Milacron equipment dating back to 1884.andP;  Service parts specialists handleabout 400 calls per day.andM;Prior to Cinphony, Milacron used a voice mail system, with parts specialistsreturning unanswered calls.andP;  Although Milacron is a large company.andP;  theycouldn't justify buying an ACD for this small departmental operation.andP;  UsingCinphony and Norstar, they are able to run a mini-ACD behind their PBX.andO;Milacron's customers are now talking to people 94% of the time, as opposed tomerely 55% with the voice mail systemandM;&quot;When a customer is calling us, it's usually because their machine is down -they need a new part to get it up and running again,&quot; said Gary Finney,Marketing Manager of the Service Parts Division.andP;  &quot;Every minute they're downcosts them money.andP;  We have to be attentive to that because they'll goelsewhere to get that part if we  can't get to them in time.andP;  Now customersare gettining immediate answers.&quot;andM;Mr.andP;  Finney also enjoys Cinphony's reports.andP;  They make him more highlyattuned to trends in  his market.andP;  &quot;Because of the reports Cinphonygenerates, we can react quickly to changing business conditions that we wereonly guessing about before.andP;  The ACD technology is going to help us keepcustomers today as well as tomorrow.&quot;andM;A Fortune 500 electronics firm has also installed the Norstar/Cinphony ACDsystem to handle the inbound rush at their credit union, which services theentire corporation.andP;  The system has two applications.andP;  First, Cinphony routesinbound calls  among a group of agents handling inquiries and  transactionslike account balances and transfers.andM;Secondly, Cinphony queues calls made to their Integrated Voice Response (IVR)system.andP;  Instead of busy signals, customers now are placed on queue andreceive announcements promoting credit union services.andP;  News items are alsoplayed.andP;  Cinphony reports gives the call center the vital stats to track howwell they are handling the work load.andM;Mitel's Host Command InterfaceandM;Mitel (Boca Raton, FL) has developed the Host Command Interface (HCI), aswitch-to-host link for their popular SX-2000 digital PBXs.andP;  HCI wasintroduced back in 1989, as part of the, MS2004 release.andP;  Already, over 50SX-2000s have been sold with the, CNI option.andP;  Thirty companies haveintegrated applications to the DEC VAX, the Mitel Applications Platform orthrough one of Mitel's value added resellers.andM;HCI has also been used as the open application link on the GX5000 centraloffice switch.andP;  USWest has developed kill Enhanced 911 application in thisenvironment.andP;  HCI will soon be incorporated into the Mitel SX-200 DigitalPBX, via release G1004.andM;The Mitel Telephony Applications Interface (MiTAI) is an important VARdevelopment tool.andP;  Residing on a 386AT  computer.andP;  MiTAI allows theapplication programmer to implement applications over the HCI link.andP;  A numberof US VARs have expressed interest in MiTAI, and will participate in trialsthis fall.andP;  Mitel Semiconductor has already purchased a license for the MVIPprotocol, and will be using them in their voice processing products.andM;HCI has already yielded the powerful  Call Center Manager  application, anadvanced message  desk  eared for high traffic call centers.andP;  The applicationfurnishes high quality message taking and retrieval with a &quot;real voice&quot;answering business lines.andM;Call Center Manager has been installed at the Bay Business Center executivesuites in San Jose, CA.andP;  Two agents answer the various lines of differenttenant-businesses, with a professional script customized for each tenant.andO;The agent can forward messages to voice mail or a pager with a single keystroke.andP;  Agents can also take down written messages or send the text to thedisplay of the versatile Mitel Superset 4 or 4N.andM;ACD SuperVision, another HCI application, is an advanced agent, group andcall center management tool which integrates with the SX-2000 PBX/ACD.andP;  Itdelivers real-time displays at the agent, group and call center level.andO;Mouse-driven menus allow easy manipulation of relative database info.andP;  Theapplication also provides a complete reporting package for agents, groups andthe overall call center, with a menu-driven scheduling system.andM;SuperVision was developted under the aegis of Revenue Canada, which hasimplemented the application in Ottawa and Vancouver the two largest taxationcenters in Canada.andM;At TCA, Mitel announced an enormous breakthrough for the SX PBXs in generaland HCI in particular.andP;  The SX-200 Light and SX-2000 Light arefiber-distributed PBX systems.andP;  They consist of peripheral  cabinetsconnected to a main control unit via fiber links.andP;  The peripheral cabinetscan be placed as far as 3,300 feet from the control unit.andM;Up to seven 96-port peripheral cabinets are available on the SX-200 Lightsystem.andP;  The SX-2000 Light supports up to 11 192-port peripherals, withreflundant and non-redundant main  control.andP;  The architecture is especialyeffective in campus-variety environments, like hospitals, universities andgovernment complexes, and for buildings with wiring restraints.andM;Since both systems use the same cabinets and share a number of interfacecards, the breakthrough draws the historically distinct SX-200 and SX-20002000 a common  direction.andP;  By distributing the cabinets, it also brings thesystem interface closer to each department.andP;  Thus, companies can  developcustomized work group applications for each department, as opposed to thehighly centralized applications which dominate today's market.andP;  NorthernTelecom's ACCESS ToolkitandM;Northern Telecom's (Nashville, TN) Norstar is a  digital hybrid withcompletely open architecture.andP;  Using Northern's ACCESS Toolkit, softwaredevelopers have created a abroad spectrum of  applications for this system.andO;They have also adapted scores of existing applications for Norstar use.andM;Developers write applications in C language on a PC.andP;  The, toolkit enablesPCs to place, answer, transfer, conference or  disconnect calls fortelephones governed by the application.andP;  ACCESS thus affords full integrationof your computing and telephony resources.andM;Because ACCESS uses standards like DOS and Microsoft C, developers can easilyadapt existing software to Norstar.andP;  Telemagic Canada is the exclusicelicensee of the Telemagic conmangament software system in Canada.andP;  ThroughACCESS they have tightly integrated Telemagic with the Norstar.andP;  Theincorporation of Norstar didn't require any modification of the basicsoftware.andP;  only a simple capabilities which incorporates Norstar capabilitiesinto Telemagic.andM;The resulting StarMagic Norstar solution allows the Telemagic user to answer,conference, hold, retrieve, transfer  or disconnect a call via their PCkeyboards instead of through a Norstar station set.andP;  in a LAN environment,all Networked terminals can use the Norstar module in  conjunction with theirNorstar sets.andP;  Norstar also provides records of system and agent activitydata, for a more productive  all center.andM;&quot;We have been extremely pleased with the results of Norstar ACCESS,&quot; saidGerry Brown, President of Telemagic Canada.andP;  &quot;Our customers now havecapabilities that exceed their expectations.&quot;andM;Oriole Business Systems has  implemented  the StarMagic Norstar.andP;  Oriolemarkets office supplies, forms and business software in Toronto.andP;  Since theyimplemented application,  they have become far more efficient in contactingclients.andM;ACCESS has also given rise to totally new products.andP;  ICSI  Mankato., MN)created a Norstar message center with the toolkit.andP;  Dubbed StarText, themessage center does away  with sloppy pink slip messaging.andP;  Receptionists cannow type a phone message  into a directly into the PC.andP;  through a menu-drivenformat.andP;  The message is sent  to the appropriate Norstar station set, where amessage indicator is activated.andM;The user can read his messages across the LCD  display.andP;  With a single touchof his button, he can then return the  call.andP;  Message lists  can be printedand faxed to any location, and phone users can sign out from their stationsets.andM;The StarText solution is an electronic messaging alternative to voice mail.andO;Susan Cross, Marketing Manager of ICSI, claims &quot;the message center givesNorstar  distributors an application that is state-of-the-art yet easy touse.andP;  The acceptance by both Norstar  distributors and  customers has beenexciting.&quot;andM;With the advent of Norstar ACCESS.andP;  open applications are no longer theprivilege of large corporations.andP;  Dynamic, switch-to-host software has becomeavailable for the smallest of start-up companies.andP;  Summa Four's SDS-500,SDS-1000andM;Summa Four's  Manchester, NH) SDS-500 and SDS-1000 are not your conventionalPBXs or ACDs.andP;  However, they have served as the  key elements in major callcenter solutions.andP;  SDS-based applications have been writtenfor servicebureaus and 800/900 gateways.andP;  These applications have been implemented onCPE equipment or in network environments.andM;The SDS-500 and SDS-1000 provide a true open applications interface, forreal-time application software control of network interface and serviceresources.andP;  You can program them  at several  levels.andM;A powerful command and support set gives you host application control.andO;Internal macros, templates and tables enable you to control resident callprocessing.andP;  Host resident application development tool packages have also)been released.andM;Your menu of interface resources includes analog lines and trunks, standardT-1 and ISDN primary rate interface.andP;  You can blend together any of theseresources in a seamless web.andP;  Accurate call progress analysis, MF/DTMF tonereceiving, speaker independent speech recognition and digital conferencingare your major service resources.andM;SDS  can provide ISDN connectivity to older PBXs unable to adapt to theservice on their own.andP;  Working as all adjunct, the SDS ISDN server canprovide real ISDN features without  replacing the existing PBX or telephoneISDN terminal adaptors, telephones of- terminals.andM;ISDN/SDS applications have been written to provide telecommuting to nationalcall centers.andP;  Via ANI.andP;  the host can sort  calls by  geographic location.andO;services needed or customer profile.andP;  Both the caller and his datafile canthen be sent to a regional or homebound agent.andM;Summa Four has also outlined a banking application for automated customerservices.andP;  Using a host, fax server and a voice response unit (VRU), clientscan call an 800 number to get information on interest  rates,  loans  oraccount updates.andM;In the banking application, the  SDS-1000 directs the callers to the VRU,which presents them with a menu of options.andP;  The caller can make hisselections verbally or with DTMF tones.andP;  The selections are passed to the host, which instructs the VRU to emit the appropriate response.andP;  During thecall, the client can request a fax  detailing the same information--say, hismortgage balance, or  current loan rates.andP;  He can  also speak to a warm body at any  given time.andM;A network-based fax service application can support broadcast fax, delayedtransmission, fax retry, store and forward and received fax screening.andO;unifi's PhoneServer and Distributed CallCenterandM;Unifi's (Billerica, MA) PhoneServer is a revovutionary new  concept in openarchitecture.andP;  PhoneServer acts as a software platform to intelligentlycontrol the public network, commanding it to route calls to any local orremote site over a plain-vanilISDN Bill X.25 link.andM;PhoneServer provides a unique alternative to customer premise equipmentaltogether.andP;  It harnesses the ultimate power and  reliability of the publicnetwork for your business.andP;  Your database.andP;  your telephones and  any otherperipherals can be placed at any geographic spot you choose,  when connectgedto the public  network via the simple BRI link.andP;  All such resources can beshared  with complete transparency.andM;Unifi has introduced a Distributed CallCenter founded upon PhoneServerarchitecture.andP;  Unlikje traditional ACD applications, customer calls are notsimply dumped into the Distributed CallCenter.andP;  While each inbound call isstill in the public network, a message is sent to PhoneServer along the ISDND channel.andP;  The network can provide PhoneServer with set-up messages, DNIS orANI numbers.andP;  PhoneServer then commands the network to shunt each call to thelocation best equipped to handle it.andM;To save on long-distance charges some regional PhoneServer stations can beequipped with call discriminators, each composed of an ISDN co-processor cardand a remote service module.andP;  Thus, if your PhoneServer controller is locatedin California, and a call is initiated from the East Coast, your East Coastfacilities can steer the call directly their way.andP;  Think of the calldiscriminators as antennae for the controller, which make the entire systemmore efficient.andM;The Distributed CallCenter places no restrictions on the number of computersystems you use, or how they integrate.andP;  Established call centers can retaintheir existing backbone data networks, or they can shift their data as wellas their voice connections around via the universal X.25 ISDN BRI interface.andM;Note that you can place agents anywhere, that ther's no switching hardware,OPX lines or any other limiting facilities involved.andP;  Agents can easily beset up in informal call centers, comprised of both office people andtelecommuters.andP;  Agents who are recovering from an illness but are ready towork could conceivably hook up their Unifi terminal from their convalescentbed, and contribute just as effectively to the company as before.andM;Another halmark of the Distributed CallCenter is the innovative agentworkstation.andP;  Rather than using both a proprietary phone and a terminal, theUnifi workstation is a PC using Windows software, with the agent headsetplugged directly into the terminal.andM;Whenever an agent receives a  call, he,'ll have all relevant networkinformation -- like ANI -- sent in advance to his phone window.andP;  Thatinformation is copied into a host application window, and the agentautomatically receives the callers  datafile along with his call.andP;  The agentcan also transfer both call and the datafile simultaneously to a supervisoror another agent via the Windows program.andM;There's an incalculable advantage of having a PC talk to the host -- apeer-to-peer exchange -- than having a proprietary telephone systemcommunicate with your data resources.andP;  The former scenario is far morestreamlined than the latter.andM;Rather than earmarking an entire agent group as an overflow group, theDistributed CallCenter can assign overflow responsibilities to individualagents, based upon their unique skills.andP;  Some agents working in yourorder-taking department may be excellent an handling exchanges.andP;  but areabysmal in dealing with customer complaints.andP;  The Distributed CallCenterassigns each agent based upon his own particular talents.andM;The overflow search is an expanding search.andP;  Agents whose tertiary skill iscustomer complaints may be called into action on unusually busy day.andP;  Theysearch also looks backward, never losing sight of the agents best equipped tohandle the calls.andP;  If one of the first choices suddenly becomes free, thecall will be routed there.andM;Unifi's Distributed CallCenter is UNIX-based.andP;  It is written in C language,and employs an Informix relational database and standard off-the-shelfdevelopment platform and hardware.andP;  This is truly open telephony - the usercan obtain the equipment from the dealer he trusts the most, or who has givenhim the best deal.andM;Customers get development licenses with either the Distributed Call Center orPhoneServer.andP;  They are free to develop new PhoneServer applications or honeexisting ones to their needs.andP;  A set of application programming interfaces is provided.andP;  Installation, training, warranty and 800-number support arealso a part of the purchase price.andM;A graphical user interface lends a three-dimensional look to your call centerprogramming, not the usual textbased command structure.andP;  3D graphics providea visual conceptualization  for routing.andP;  They remove the intimidation factorfor call center personnel who are not computer programmers.andM;Unifi's  Distributed CallCenter is currently in the testing process, and willbe generally available in January 1992.andP;  It will run you  50,000 for a10-agent configuration when you supply your own hardware, with eachadditional agent costing an additional $1,500.andP;  Included in the package is the  underlying PhoneServer software and the development license.andP;  DigitalTechniques' DISA Voice Security (DVS) SystemandM;The, DISA Voice Security (DVS) System by Digital Techniques  Allen, TX) is ahighly effective instrument for telecom security.andP;  It provides secureDISA-variety features, without using vulnerable PBX DISA software.andP;  DVS alsosupports SecurID, a smart card which  changes its passcode every 60 seconds.andO;An interesting use of non-repeating number generation.andM;An ancillary processor, DVS is capable of  loin, everything DISA does.andP;  Itperforms all user authentications  and restrictions, and ascertains callorginations.andP;  By supplanting DISA, it also lifts the spectra of DISA hackers,computer thieves who can run up thousands of dollars on your phone  bill.andM;DVS furnishes multiple levels of security.andP;  The system  unles the user byvoice prompts instead of the usual DISA tones or beeps.andP;  Most hacker programsneed to  detect these beeps in order to penetrate your PBX.andP;  By employingvoice prompts, the program is often  deceived into thinking it has reached alive operator, and  hangs up.andM;Each user is given a unique ID code, he must enter in before  getting pastthe first prompt.andP;  After a userselected number of bIown attempts, DVS canhang up on a suspicious caller.andP;  The SecurID Card, virtually impossible tocrack, brovi(les added protection against PBX toll fraud.andP;  By assigning yourtechnicians SecureID cards, you can also protect your maintenance modem.andM;On a tiser-by-user basis, DVS can restrict when users have, access, sensitiveto time and day.andP;  The system can bar international calls and  certain areacodes, and can limit the number of  calls made per  lay, hour, week or month.andO;As a precautionary measure,  DVS can automatically shut  down abusedaccounts.andM;DVS handles  data security as well as voice  calls.andP;  Modems  on your host canbe set up so they are inaccessible from outside the PBX.andP;  From then on,access to your host can be granted only by dialing through the DVS system.andM;DVS boasts friendly, menu-driven administration.andP;  Report generation and ahard copy audit trail are available.andP;  DVS also can integrate with yourcurrent client billing packages.andM;The system runs on a 386 PC running a multi-tasking operating system shell.andO;DVS can work with any PBX capable  of performing a trunk-to-trunk transferfrom a 2500 set.andP;  Rolm, InteCom, ATandamp;T, Ericsson, Northern Telecom and otherPBX can be accommodated.andP;  Redcom's Modular Switching PeripheralandM;The, Modular Switching Peripheral (MSP) by Redcom (Victor, NY) is anadvanced, full programmable switching peripheral.andP;  The MSP  cana becompletely controlled by the host computer, whose software makes alldecisions and defines the overall operation of the specialized system.andM;A straightforward command language makes the MSP  effortless to program andcontrol.andP;  You do not have to interface your telecom, voice and data bIants atthe most minuscule of levels.andP;  The MSP allows you to concentrate on thebroatler switch-to-host application.andM;The MSP is founded upon Redcom's Modular Switching Units (MSUs),  digitaldistributed building bIocks.andP;  Each  component harbors its own microprocessorcontrol, which communicates the rest of the  system through a  data bus.andP;  Youcan keep on adding  MSUs until you reach the  maximum of 400 ports.andM;Commands and  responses between the host and  the MSP travel over an RS-232Clink.andP;  Multiple links  !an be established for fail-safe, switch-to-hostarchitecture.andP;  The RS-232C  connections incorporate a fault  detection andrecovery protocol, for bi-directional communication.andM;The MSP has been used in a variety of open applications.andP;  In a CellularMobile Telephone application, the MSP furnishes th(, switching systeminterface to the local  buplic network and cell cites.andP;  When prodded by thehost, the MSP establishes and ends mobile calls, and helps to relaytransmissions from one cell to another.andM;An  Inter-Exchange  Carrier Arrangement is geared  for leased transmissionfacilities.andP;  When the MSP receives the inbound  calls, the host commands itto route calls over the leased lines.andP;  The application can also cross-connectcalls to other peripherals for voice mail access or other subscriberservices.andM;Because of its programmability, the MSP can serve in practically any otherapplication you dream up.andP;  Dispatch centers.andP;  third party billing,800-service, automatic operator services and answering service applicationscan all be implemented.andP;  Rhetorex's RSDP FamilyandM;The Rhetorex (Campbell, CA) RSDP voice processing components are founded uponDigital Signal Processing (DSP), a unique  technology which employshigh-quality software alogrithms  as opposed  to limiting hardware.andP;  The RDSPproducts are available in two, lour and 24-line increments of IBM PC/XT orPC/AT single slot form factors.andP;  They can serve in the simplest voice mailapplication and in the largest, most intricate applications.andM;The RSDP broducts offer stellar voice reproduction, compression.andP;  blaypack,DTMF detection and generation, call progress  detection and generation andvoice recognition.andP;  Pulse/rotary detection and generation and conferencingare available for special applications, while speed  control serves you wellin dictation environments.andM;A DOS driver and Application Programming Interface is included  with all RSDPcomponents free of charge.andP;  Drivers for OS/2 and Unix are also available.andO;Preprogrammed terminate-and-stay resident  driver routines provide thenecessary control.andM;Rhetorex offers a variety of software utilities to assist the systemintegrator in developing voice processing applications.andP;  A Visual VoiceEditor lets you record, play or graphically display one or more audiosignals.andP;  You can visually cut and paste the displayed signal, and displayone or more audio signals in graphic terms.andM;The AccuCall Plus Utility enables the system to automatically recognize PBXor key system signals, or those signals emanating from the  public network.andO;During installation.andP;  AccuCall Plus is used to analyze and save the signalcharacteristics it detects.andP;  The charactcrs are stored on a table.andP;  which can be consulted for network or system categorization and testing.andM;High level interface routines furnish vital support to the Microsoft CCompiler.andP;  Integration with Brooktrout multi-channel fax products will befacilitated by common support of the MVIP bus.andM;Rhetorex has recently announced a new marketing assistance program forsoftware VARs.andP;  The S.M.A.R.T.andP;  (Software Marketing Assistance for RhetorexTechnology) program is geared for developers of voice processing applicationsand other tools.andM;Through S.M.A.R.T., Rhetorex offers VARs an additional channel ofdistribution through their endorsement, promotion and sale of their softwar(products.andP;  There is no charge for developers to submit a package.andO;Refreshingly, Rhetorex has not placed any restraint to the number ofdevelopers they will allow into the, program.andM;Rhetorex has also just added fourand 24-port speaker independent voicerecognition capabilities to RDSP line.andP;  Teleos' IRX9000 Intelligent ResourceExchangeandM;The,  IRX9000  bv  Teleos (Eatontown.andP;  NJ) is annovative alternative totraditional PBX/ACDS.andP;  it is a small-sized, high-performance ISDN switchwhich defers call  control to  an external computer.andP;  Teleservices areprovided by an IBM/400 or other host.andP;  Users can change and implementfeatures, management reports and other system functions with a flexibilityunmatched by any traditional PBX.andM;The IRX9000 sends information provided by ISDN primary rate and other networkservices to CallPathvariety computers across an IBM Token Ring LAN.andP;  Whenintegrated with your current  database, the link leads to Intelligent CallDistribution applications.andM;The system can mix both inbound and outbound traffic dynamically, and canadjust in real-time as calling patterns change.andP;  This capability canseriously cut down  on costs, since inbound 800 and outbound WATS resourcescan be balanced on the same access line.andM;The IRX9000  can also significantly improve the efficiency  of outboundapplications, since you're sending network work calling data directly via adedicated signalling channel.andP;  When your call is completed, the computer isnotified instantly via that selfsame signalling channel.andM;A newpredictive dialing call center system has made use of the IRX9000.andP;  The,system has ben installed as a call set-up and routing solution for atelemarketing firm performing high-speed, high-volume sales.andM;The 96-agent system costs only $2500 per agent seat.andP;  The system isespecially effective because it leverages the switched digital network,eliminating the need for costly dedicated lines and private switchingequipment.andM;A customer service department is also using an AS/400.andP;  and IRX9000 and ISDN.andO;The resultant system uses ANI to deliver the customer's datafile and his callsimultaneously to the agent's desktop.andP;  The  department also uses the systemto keep  demographics on the origin of customer calls, the assess the needsof each region.andM;Aristacom's SCIL*LINKandM;SCIL*LINK (Switch/Computer Interface Link) by Aristacom International(Alameda,  CA) is an application package which integrates switching andcomputer environments and delivers sophisticated call managementapplications.andP;  These applications include: simultaneous and automatic screenpresentation along with a voice call; voice/data transfer and conferencing;predictive, intelligent and preview dialing options; reporting;

 including inbound and outbound call brocessing,transfer/conference, call processing, computer-managed (third-party)telephony and agent-managed first party) telephony.andP;  These essentialfunctions can be tailored to meet the needs of a wide range of industries.andM;The SCIL*ACP/2 is Aristacom's Application Call Processor for the PS/2environment.andP;  It is a workstation application, designed to support automaticcall  distribution functions.andM;For agents handling high amounts of voice and data.andP;  SCIL*ACP/2 providesscreen  synchronization, voice/data transfer and conferencing and keyboarddialing.andP;  ACD management functions are fully integrated into the PS/2workstation.andP;  Agents can answer the call effortlessly no matter where theyare in the program.andM;SCIL*ACP/2  gives you many options in voice/data call handling.andP;  Forinstance, you can conference voive and data at the outset.andP;  Or, you canconference only the voice  -.all, and send the data only upon request.andP;  Or,you can hold a conference consultation, and then execute the voice and datatransfer.andP;  The system offers you that kind of flexibility.andM;The Travelers insurance company has used SCIL*LINK products for its customerservice facility.andP;  Travelers employs voice response units to handle inboundcalls.andP;  Their application includes the SCIL*VRU (voice response unit), theSCIL*IG (interface to ATandamp;T's ISDN Gateway Protocop and the SCIL*SNA Gateway.andO;Taken together, these  components furnish simultaneous call and datafiledelivery to the agent's desktop within the larger call center environment.andO;The Aristacom software works in conjunction with the company's TOPs Travelers' On-Line Processing System).andM;A bank also uses the Aristacom application, to brovide 401K of information toall of its member companies.andM;Aristacom recently announced that it has become an IBM Business Partner forCallPath Services Architecture.andP;  SCIL*CSA will be released in the firstquarter of 1992.andP;  thus adding to Aristacom's broadly compatible productfamily.andP;  It will link a variety of switches to IBM System/370 and System/390mainframes.andP;  The company has already established formal marketingpartnerships with ATandamp;T, Rockwell, Aspect and Talx, in addition to moreinformal working relationships with  other vendors.andP;  Dialogic's ResourceSharing ArehitecturesandM;Dialogic (Parsippany.andP;  NJ), the giant of PC-based voice brocessing, hasreleased two resources sharing architectures - the Analog Expansion Bus (AEB)and the PCM Expansion Bus (PEB).andP;  The architectures allow system integratorsto develop custom call processing applications.andP;  They also permit the variouscomponents to communicate in real-time, and to share information with eachother on the PC platform.andM;PEB and AEB enable developers to build voice processing systems that sharedifferent resources or capabilities on a common platform.andP;  For example, youcan connect your voice store and forward components to a variety of resourcemodules.andP;  These resource modules can provide speaker-independent voicerecognition, facsimile, text-to-speech or other capabilities.andP;  The platformcan employ anato-, T-1 digital and ISDN PRI network interfaces.andM;Both architectures have been opened to third-party developers, allowing themto construct both AEB- and PEB-compatible components.andP;  Dialogic supportstheir developers through a Technology Developers Program, offered as part ofthe company's broader OPEN Development Program.andP;  VARs have already releasedseveral PEB and AEB compatible components.andM;The PEB, or PCM Expansion Bus, is a time-division multiplexed bus thatcarries information between the DIALOG/12-port voice store and forwardmodules, resources and network interfaces in digital form.andP;  Since anyresource can attach itself to any channel on the bus, multiple voice channelscan share voice recognition, fax or other capabilities.andM;The AEB, or Analog Expansion Bus, connects DIALOG/4-port voice store andforward components to other resources, furnishing resource sharing bymultiple channels in an analog format.andP;  You can interface components throughDialogic's AMX/81, a cross-point matrix switch, to connect and share infoamong various channels.andP;  The platform also enables telephones to be connecteddirectly to the voice response system with no PBX intervention.andM;IBM has recently announced CallPath DirectTalk/2, a PS/2-based host IVRsystem which employs Dialogic PEB resource sharing architecture on aMicroChannel platform.andP;  DirectTalk/2 can handle up to 16 telephone linessimultaneously, employing up to two Dialogic LSI/80MC Loop Start Interfacecards.andM;These cards are interfaced to Dialogic store-and-forward cards, and to thecompany's VR/81-MC Voice Recognition System, for simultaneousspeaker-independent voice recognition up to eight channels.andP;  DirectTalk/2 canalso hook up to various IBM databases.andP;  The system's open design allowscompanies like Granada Systems to develop new applications and enhancementsuPon it.andM;Telecorp Systems, a Dialogic Solutions Developer, has developed a voiceprocessing application for a cable  pay-per-view  service.andP;  Customers callinto the company to request a program automatically.andP;  The front-end switchsends the call to the voice response unit.andP;  The caller selects the desiredprogram and enters an account code for billing.andP;  The VRU then sends the infoto the head-end cable computer, while shunting the billing data to a billingcenter.andP;  The customer gests his program, and the billing center, of course,sends the bill.andM;The PEB and AEB platforms can also be used for broadcast fax or fax-on-demandsystems.andP;  Customers call into the VRU, select a  document and have thedocument automatically sent out to them in the same call.andP;  Or the system canhave the fax sent on a separate call, thus saving the prospect or valuedcustomer the expense.andM;In a broadcast application, the VRU  :an broadcast time-sensitive informationby fax.andP;  The originals can be scanned in or accessed from the database.andO;Dialogic customers like Copia International have installed a system forLand's End, which faxes out special sale flyers or catalog pages tocustomers.andM;Brooktrout Technologies has developed a two-line fax product compatible withAEB.andP;  Dialogic will show their own 12-channel fax product, the FAX/120, atthe New York City's Voice show in November.andP;  InteCom's OAIandM;Since it introduced OAI in 1987, inteCom (Allen, TX) has been providingbusiness solutions through internally developed applications and throughtheir strategic partners.andP;  InteCom's development  approach  stresses enhancedproductivity, increased end-user control and increased revenue.andP;  Threelaudable goals.andM;InteCom offers application proramming interfaces  (APIs) for MSDOS, VAX/VMS,OS/2, SCO XENIX, interactive UNIX and AIX operating systems, to accommodatecustomers want to use their own programming staff to develop customapplications.andP;  The APIs offer a communications driver layer of software, aswell as a  &quot;C&quot; language API.andP;  InteCom also has a DOS-based OAItester/emulator program for preliminary testing of applications.andP;  A dedicatedOAI testing facility is equipped with the IBX, Telari and assorted computerplatforms.andM;The Integrated Message Center is one of the most widely used OAIapplications.andP;  At a large US law firm, the application serves 200+ attorneys.andO;Before the Message Center was installed, an unanswered call was routed to theattendant on the called party's floor.andP;  The receptionist would have to takedown a handwritten message.andP;  During busy hours, some crucial calls wentunanswered.andM;In the IMS application, the unanswered calls are still initially routed t()the receptionist on the called attorney's floor.andP;  If the receptionist isbusy, the IBX will route the call to an available receptionist on anotherfloor.andM;That receptionist is automatically provided with a message screen at hercomputer terminal.andP;  The screen identifies the  called attorney, as well aswhy the call wasn't answered - busy, no answer, all calls forwarded.andP;  It alsogives information regarding the attorney's schedule, location and any timewhen he would be available.andP;  Attorneys can read the messages on their dispiay sets and place callbacks or print the message using feature buttonson the telephone set.andM;A Campus Emergency 911 application has gained popularity with the educationand health  care markets.andP;  The University of Minnesota has installed thisapplication on their VAX 6410.andP;  The VAX 6410 uses three IBXs to serve 25,000stations, spread over 300+ buildings.andP;  The entire campus is served by onecentralized Campus Emergency E911 application.andM;When the University Police department receives an emergency call, theapplication provides the dispatcher with the caller's location information.andO;Special hotline phones are provided in strategic locations, like parkinglots, so a student needs only to knock the receiver off hook for the systemto locate his distress call.andP;  The system services as many as 700 emergencycalls per month.andM;InteCom's DSA is a VAX-based Data Security Administration System.andP;  it hasbeen installed at a large petrochemical manufacturer whose two IBXs serve15,000 users.andP;  DSA enables the customer to screen and authenticate allexternal data users dialing through the IBXs to access their computersystems.andM;instead of dialing directly into the computer, callers must dial into the DSAsystem.andP;  They are screened on a  combination of customer-definable data,including name, password, requested computer system, DES (Data EncryptionStandard) token challenge, time of day, day of week, etc.andM;Once the caller is authenticated, DSA instructs the appropriate IBX to blacea  data  call from the request computer system back to the  caller's  datadevice.andP;  If the user flunks the ID process, DSA drops the connection, therebyfoiling access to the hoped-for  data resource.andM;A major hospital in Louisiana uses DSA in a radically different way.andP;  Sincephysicians may be callin, in from locations where a callback is impossible,DSA can transfer data calls to the appropriate computer once the caller'saccess has been verified.andM;Other exciting InteCom applications we'll mention in passing is a PC-basedTime Clock and a VAXbased ACD Supervisor Terminal Expansion (ASTEX)application.andP;  CULTIVATING COMPUTER-TELEPHONE LINK STANDARDSandM;The following observations are from Jim Burton, at ComputerTelephone Link(Boston, MA).andM;Currently, computer vendors and application developers that work with oneswitch must redesign software (and often hardware) to work with anotherswitch.andP;  &quot;It costs approximately  1 million to work with a new PBX vendor,&quot;says Carl Strathmeyer, Director of Marketing for DEC's Computer IntegratedTelephony (CIT) program.andM;Ron Charnock, president of NPRI, a leading developer of computer-to-telephonelink application software and chairman of the Alliance of Computer-BasedTelephony Application Suppliers, says, &quot;it cost my company nearly $500,000every time we link our software to a new switch.andM;The American National Standards Institute (ANSI) and the European ComputerManufacturers Association (ECMA) are both working on standards for theindustry.andM;The ANSI TIS1.1 ISDN Working Group - whose standards project is namedSwitch-Computer Application Interface (SCAI) - is addressing both public andprivate networks, while the ECMA TTG11 (Technical Committee 32, Task Group11) committee - whose developing standard is known informally asComputer-Sitpported Telephony Applications (CSTA) - decided last year tofocus exclusively on interfaces for PBX switches.andM;Although both ANSI and ECMA have made remarkable progress on their respectivestandards, there is just no shortcutting the tortuously slow process.andM;C-T Link can be reached at 617-737-1277.andM;We'll report on their progress as it happens in TELECONNECT, and at TelecomDevelopers  92 (in Dallas, May 5, 6, 7, 1992).andP;  CINPHONY AS INTEGRATIONPLATFORMandM;Cinphony was designed from the outset with &quot;hooks&quot; for integration.andP;  As aplatform, it incorporates digital voice cards to support announcementcapabilities within Cinphony, and to integrate with IVR and auto attendants.andM;Cinphony can interface with other systems in at least three areas.andP;  A programmodule collects  data from the caller while in  queue and then routes  callsto a specific  queue and agent based on that data.andP;  This scenario  couldinclude simultaneous voice/data delivery to the agent's desktop.andM;A  data table module reaps real-time data for on-line status screens or fordisplay on wall boards.andP;  An event data file module uses real-time systemactivity data for reports or for feed to manpower planning systems.andP;  Lastly,a database module uses system stats to build reports or for on-line injuries.andM;Using the program module interface, Cintech will release an entry-level ACDwith complete auto attendant capabilities in early 1992.andP;  Unlike most low-endsystems with glorified UCD, it will be a true ACD, replete with real-timestatus screens, reporting and a wholly integrated auto attendant.andP;  NORTHERNTELECOM BROADENS ACCESS FOR NORSTARandM;In an effort to broaden the appeal of the Norstar ACCESS developer program,Northern Telecom has introduced an optional pricing package, allowingdevelopers to acquire the toolkit, develop the application and test itsmarketability at minimal cost.andM;Initially, Norstar ACCESS was available in a bundled format for $25,000.andO;That price included the toolkit, 40 hours of technical support, runtimeduplication rights for the first 1,000 units and bundled hardware.andP;  Northernis still offering this package deal, which might even turn out to be thecheaper option, depending on your requirements.andM;They have also unbundled the above elements, to better meet the needs ofprospective developers.andP;  The new prices are as follows:  1,995 for the ACCESStoolkit; technical support in eight-hour blocks at $950 each; runtimeduplication rights in 100 unit lots, $2,000 each up to 1,000 units; anddeveloper selected hardware.andM;Whatever pricing option you choose, runtime duplication rights in excess of1,000 of developed applications are as follows: 1,000 for $10,000; or 100units for $2,000.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
