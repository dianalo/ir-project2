Arab reports said Israeli soldiers shot and wounded 36Palestinians during clashes Sunday with stone-throwing protesters insix villages and refugee camps. The army said it was checking thereports.   During the 21-month-old uprising in the occupied West Bank andGaza Strip, 572 Palestinians have been killed by soldiers or Israelicivilians and 114 have been slain by fellow Arabs who suspected themof collaborating with Israel. Forty Israelis have been killed.   Rabin's trip Monday comes before an expected flurry of MiddleEast diplomacy at the U.N. General Assembly during which Israeli,Egyptian and U.S. officials are to discuss Mubarak's peace proposals.   Elias Freij, the Palestinian Mayor of Bethlehem in the occupiedWest Bank, returned Sunday from a trip to Tunisia where he said heurged PLO chief Yasser Arafat to endorse Mubarak's ideas.   Freij is the first Palestinian leader in the West Bank topublicly announce a meeting with Arafat, in defiance of an Israelilaw that bans meetings with leaders of the Palestine LiberationOrganization, Israel Television reported.   U.S. State Department officials have said Mubarak's 10-pointpeace plan, recently presented to Israeli officials, could be usefulin reviving Israel's proposal for Palestinian elections in the WestBank and Gaza Strip.   But the Egyptian move also has caused a rift between the twomajor parties in Israel's coalition Cabinet.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir's right-wing Likud bloc opposesMubarak's demand that Israel agree to trade land for peace. It alsoopposes giving Arabs in Israeli-annexed east Jerusalem the right tovote in Palestinian elections.   The left-leaning Labor Party, headed by Vice Premier ShimonPeres, accepts both points.   Rabin's trip, approved Sunday by the Cabinet, immediately touchedoff a new debate between the two parties. Recent media reports haveportrayed the defense minister as an avid supporter of negotiationsbased on Mubarak's plan.   Likud ministers met after the weekly Cabinet session and issued astatement rejecting Mubarak's initiative, saying it gives too muchground to the Palestinians.   Shamir's election plan, presented to the United States in April,calls for choosing Palestinians to negotiate an interim peace forthe occupied territories, with the final status of those territoriesto be decided later.   Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan and the Gaza Strip fromEgypt in the 1967 Middle East war.   The Israeli proposal omits the question of future boundariesbecause of Likud opposition to withdrawing from the territories.   Mubarak has also offered to arrange a Palestinian delegation tonegotiate with Israel that would include two men recently deportedfrom the occupied lands.   The proposal is designed to satisfy both Israel's demand that itmeet only Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza, and the PLO'sinsistence that Palestinians from outside the territories beincluded in peace talks.   Israel officially refuses to talk to the PLO, which it views as aterrorist group.   ``If we keep making concessions, then all we do is move into atrap set by the Palestinians,'' said Yitzhak Modai, Likud's EconomicPlanning Minister. ``A Palestinian state would endanger ourexistence. It will not happen.''   Labor leaders, however, strongly urged Israel to agree tonegotiations based on Mubarak's plan as a way to end an impasse inpeace efforts.   ``In my view, for the first time there is a chance for aPalestinian delegation to negotiations,'' Peres said on Israel radio.   Egyptian Ambassador Mohammed Bassiouny, who extended theinvitation to Rabin, said Sunday:   ``Of course Mr. Rabin is a key in the peace process ... Now theball is on the Israeli side. If you (Israel) agree, next month youwill see an Israeli delegation and a Palestinian delegation meetingin Cairo to discuss and talk about these problems.   ``Can you imagine,'' Bassiouny added, ``next month the wheels ofpeace will start.''   The Israeli government has formally agreed to put off a decisionon the plan until Peres and Foreign Minister Moshe Arens return fromvisits to the United States, where both are expected to meet Mubarakand U.S. officials.   The Egyptian plan has caused a split in the Palestinian side aswell. The PLO has announced it also will put off final judgment onthe plan until October, but the Moslem fundamentalist movementHamas, or Zeal, has condemned it.   ``No to Mubarak's 10-point plan,'' said graffiti signed by Hamasand scrawled on a wall Sunday in Bethlehem in the West Bank.   The clashes between troops and Palestinians Sunday came as Arabsobserved a general strike called by Hamas that shut down theoccupied territories. It was called to mark the anniversary of themassacre of hundreds of Palestinians by Israel's Christian allies inthe Sabra and Chatila refugee camps in Beirut in 1982.</TEXT></DOC>
