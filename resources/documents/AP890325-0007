The government has a court motion pending to quash the subpoenafor Reagan and ``we will pursue that matter,'' David Runkel, anaide to Attorney General Dick Thornburgh, said Friday.   The defense sought a court order seeking the former president'sappearance next Friday following testimony in the past month atNorth's trial that Reagan was deeply involved in helping theContras.   The judge in the North case, U.S. District Judge Gerhard A.Gesell, is expected to schedule a hearing for next week to considerthe defense request.   Reagan and then-Vice President George Bush got subpoenas fromNorth on Dec. 30 to testify at his trial but sought through theJustice Department to have them quashed. Gesell dismissed Bush'ssubpoena, but held Reagan's open, pending trial developments.   ``The importance of Mr. Reagan's testimony to the defense ofthis case is clear both from the record in the trial to date andfrom'' a filing in January by North, defense attorney BrendanSullivan said in a court filing.   North's lawyers argued Jan. 23 that concerns about privilegesfor confidential communications and state secrets must yield to ademonstrated need for testimony.   Subpoenas for the appearances of Reagan and Bush ``raiseprofound constitutional concerns,'' Thornburgh argued in January.   The concerns are in connection with ``executive privilege ...but also regarding the authority of the courts to compelappearances by a former or sitting president,'' Thornburgh said atthe time.   ``The spectacle of a former or sitting president being subjectedto peremptory judicial process may chill foreign governments in theway they deal with the president now and in the future,''Thornburgh said.   Reagan told the Tower commission investigating the Iran-Contraarms and money affair in January 1987 that he did not know hisNational Security Council staff _ including North _ was helping theContras.   According to testimony at North's trial, Reagan, based on NSCstaff recommendations:   _Secretly approved slipping $110 million worth of extra aid toHonduras as an enticement for supporting the Contras.   _Telephoned the president of Honduras to gain release of an armsshipment that had been seized by the Honduran military while enroute to the Contras.   _Apparently approved airdropping intelligence and recoillessrifles to the Contras to destroy ships carrying arms to Nicaragua.   The activities in question came in 1985 when Congress had bannedU.S. military aid to the Contras.   Former national security adviser Robert McFarlane testified thatwhen Reagan learned of a Contra contribution from a foreigncountry, the president said ``we shouldn't share that withCongress.''   ``He did not say to lie about it,'' McFarlane said of Reagan.``He just said do not share that information.''   North faces 12 criminal charges, including six alleging he liedto Congress about his activities on behalf of the Contras.</TEXT></DOC>
