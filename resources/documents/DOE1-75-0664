Attentionis given to geochemical trends in the basaltoid series and the rare-elementclarkes in these rocks as well as to the types of alkaline basaltoidsof the Russian platform. Special consideration is given to the geochemicalcharacteristics and the formation conditions of the volcanic associationsof the Maimecha-Kotui and the Baikal regions, the trends of the magmaticdifferentiation of the alkaline basalts of the Kuznecki Alatau region,and the geochemistry and genesis of the youngest volcanites in the Caucasusregion. The petrochemical typification of the alkaline-basaltic continentalseries is presented. 50 references.</TEXT></DOC>
