Multiple scans (2 to 7) were available in 16 cases. Fractionatedneutron radiotherapy was delivered over four to seven weeks to a totaldose of 60 to 67 Gy photon equivalent. Parenchymal change within thelung was noted in 43 % by 12 weeks, in 91 % between 12 and 24 weeks,and in 100 % after 24 weeks. Three different patterns of lung parenchymalchange were evident. Ectatic air-filled bronchi were observed in morethan 50 % after 24 weeks. Mediastinal shift and thoracic shrinkage weredemonstrated in six and three cases, respectively. Serial CT scans revealedthat lung parenchymal changes usually became stable or shrunk after 36weeks. The possible effect of chemotherapy (mitomycin-C, vinblastin andcis-platinum), in 19 of these patients is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
