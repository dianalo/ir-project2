Johnson III, the wealthy chairman of FidelityInvestments? Or others among Fidelity's millions ofcustomers?   All you have to do is call up a new Fidelity toll-freenumber, 1-800-544-7544. Then, you just punch in Mr. Johnson's(or anyone else's) Social Security number. In the case of theFidelity chairman, his Social Security number can be found onpublicly available documents that Fidelity is required tofile with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LP><TEXT>   His number is 029-24 . . ..   Well, we won't give you the final four digits.   But if we did, you could find out all of Mr. Johnson'sFidelity mutual fund holdings and how much they are worth. Ifyou dialed another 800 number, you could also find out whatstock and option positions he has. It's that easy.   &quot;I'm astonished,&quot; says John Bogle, chairman of VanguardGroup, Fidelity's archrival.   In fact, as things now stand, anyone can dial the Fidelitytoll-free number, punch in the Social Security number ofsomeone they know, and find out how much money that personhas at Fidelity, including the type of mutual fund. TheBoston-based mutual fund company has more than four millioncustomer accounts.   Judith McMichael, a Fidelity marketing manager, says thefirm has received only three complaints from shareholderssince the phone-in system was launched three weeks ago. AndFidelity says it hasn't any plans to change the system.   &quot;We don't put services together without thinking itthrough,&quot; says Ms. McMichael. &quot;The overwhelming number ofcustomers who are using it think it is the bees-knees. It'sextremely popular.&quot;   She says that Fidelity will take shareholders off thesystem if they request it. Ms. McMichael also says that thefirm is in the process of blocking access to the accounts ofcertain Fidelity executives, including Mr. Johnson's account.   That doesn't satisfy Eric Kobren, editor of FidelityInsight, an independent newsletter on Fidelity published outof Wellesley, Mass. &quot;What about you and me?&quot; he says. &quot;It'svery easy to find out Social Security numbers.&quot;   Mr. Kobren, who writes about the new system in his mostrecent newsletter, notes that Social Security numbers appearin a host of places, including on the front of some checks,on driver licenses, in documents filed with the SEC and ontax forms made public by politicians.   He argues that to safeguard privacy, shareholders shouldhave to punch in a secret personal identification numberbefore they get access to their mutual fund balances. Mr.Kobren concludes: &quot;It's another Big Brother type of story.&quot;   Oh, by the way, do you want to know what Fidelity mutualfunds are owned by Peter Lynch, the legendary stock pickerwho used to run Fidelity's Magellan Fund? His number is018-34 . . .. But that's another story.</TEXT></DOC>
