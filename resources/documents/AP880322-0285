Fahd suggested in a statement issued Monday that cheating onquotas and prices by some members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries encouraged further weakness in prices.   That sent prices into full reverse on the New York MercantileExchange, where contracts for April delivery of West TexasIntemediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, gave up an early 45-centgain to close at $16.49 per barrel, down 9 cents from Friday.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale heatingoil closed up 0.35 cent at 45.40 cents per gallon, after havingrisen to 46.70 cents per gallon earlier. Unleaded gasoline gave upa 1.41-cent gain to close up 0.12 cent at 46.11 cents a gallon.   The decline continued in early trading today. West TexasIntermediate was down 28 cents to $16.11 a barrel, while heatingoil was off 0.05 cent to 43.35 cents a gallon and gasoline fell0.51 cent to 45.60 cents a gallon.   ``The basic factor in balancing supply and demand is thecommitment of all member states to OPEC-decreed quotas and prices.But if one member fails to live up to this commitment, then theresult will affect the market. This is what we witness presently,''the official Saudi news agency quoted Fahd as saying.   ``Under these circumstances, it would be difficult to ask thosecommitted (to OPEC output and price controls) to modify thesituation at the expense of their quotas,'' the king said.   Analysts said Saudi Arabia is believed to have been discountingits oil lately, and that some traders interpreted Fahd's remarks asjustifying that action.   As such, it undermined a recent rally by reiterating thekingdom's well-known postition that it would not sacrifice its ownproduction or prices to bolster the market while other cartelmembers continue to cheat.   Prices, which had been sagging, rose strongly after OPECPresident Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister, said lastThursday he would announce new measures to bring stability to themarket at a press conference today.   However, a source close to Lukman said today that the pressconference was expected to focus on Nigeria's domestic oil policy,although questions on OPEC might be raised by reporters.   In addition, a spokesman for the state-owned Nigerian NationalPetroleum Corp. said the press conference, although originallyscheduled for today, was more likely to take place Wednesday orThursday.   Lukman's announcement last Thursday came one day after hedeclared he would not seek an early meeting of OPEC ministers,despite a weeks-long trend of eroding prices at the time.   Thus, many analysts said Monday they were not certain whatmeasures Lukman could announce that could have any substantiveeffect on prices.   ``Most people don't believe he's got anything new to tell theworld,'' said Donald Morton, vice president for energy futures inthe Boston office of Prudential-Bache Securities, Inc.   James Steel, an analyst at Refco Inc. Commodities, said hebelieved there were fears prices would drop sharply, oncedisappointment over Lukman's comments set into the market _ andthat the Saudi king had thus stepped in to soften the blow.   ``I think that's why Fahd made the statement today,'' Steel said.</TEXT></DOC>
