Accordingly, these matters are not included within or covered by theseimplementing regulations.Similarly, pursuant to 12 U.S.C. 2278a-10, the Assistance Board is notrequired to follow the requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act(APA) with respect to notice and comment on rulemaking. However, in theinterest of informing the public of the procedures for obtaining AssistanceBoard records that are subject to the FOIA and the Privacy Act, the AssistanceBoard is publishing these implementing regulations. The Assistance Board'sdetermination in this instance is not and should not be construed as adetermination that it is subject to the notice and comment requirementsof the APA.The Assistance Board has determined that this regulation is not a majorrule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 because it will not havean effect on the economy of $100 million or more or otherwise meet thethreshold criteria.

All fees soassessed will be charged to the requester, except where the charging offees is limited under this section or where a waiver or reduction of feesis granted under this section. All applicable fees must be received beforecopies of the requested records are made available to the requester. Requestersshall pay fees by check or money order made payable to the Assistance Boardand indicate the request for which payment is made. (b) <T3>Definitions. </T3>For the purpose of this section: (1) The term ``direct costs'' means those expenditures which the AssistanceBoard actually incurs in searching for and duplicating (and, in the caseof commercial use requesters, reviewing) records to respond to a FOIA request.Direct costs include, for example, the salary of the employee performingthe work (the basic rate of pay for the employee plus 16 percent of thatrate to cover benefits) and the cost of operating duplicating machinery.Not included in direct costs are overhead expenses such as costs of spaceand heating or lighting of the facility in which the records are stored.(2) The term ``search'' includes all time spent looking for material thatis responsive to a request, including page-by-page or line-by-line identificationof material within documents.(3) The term ``duplication'' refers to a process of making a copy of arecord necessary to respond to a FOIA request. Such copies can take theform of paper, copy, microform, audio-visual materials, or machine-readabledocumentation (e.g., magnetic tape or disk) among others. The copy providedshall be in a form that is reasonably usable by requesters. (4) The term ``review'' refers to the process of examining a record locatedin response to a request in order to determine whether any portion of itis permitted to be withheld. It also includes processing any record fordisclosure, e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise it and otherwiseprepare it for release. Review costs shall be recoverable even where thereultimately is no disclosure of a record. Review time does not include timespent resolving general legal or policy issues regarding the applicationof exemptions. (5) The term ``commercial use'' refers to a request from or on behalf ofone who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthers the commercial,trade, or profit interests of the requester or the person on whose behalfthe request is made, which can include furthering those interests throughlitigation. Where the circumstances of a request suggest that the requesterwill put the records sought to a commercial use, either because of thenature of the request itself or because the Assistance Board has reasonablecause to doubt a requester's stated use, the Assistance Board will providethe requester a reasonable opportunity to submit further clarification.(6) The term ``educational institution'' refers to a preschool, a publicor private elementary or secondary school, an institution of undergraduatehigher education, an institution of graduate higher education, an institutionof professional education, and an institution of vocational education whichoperates a program or programs of scholarly research. To be eligible forinclusion in this category, a requester must show that the request is beingmade as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institutionand that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are soughtin furtherance of scholarly research. (7) The term ``noncommercial scientific institution'' refers to an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is referencedin paragraph (a)(5) of this section, and which is operated solely for thepurpose of conducting scientific research, the results of which are notintended to promote any particular product or industry. To be eligiblefor inclusion in this category, a requester must show that the requestis being made as authorized by and under the auspices of a qualifying institutionand that the records are not sought for a commercial use but are soughtin furtherance of scientific research. (8) The term ``representative of the news media'' refers to any personactively gathering news for an entity that is organized and operated topublish or broadcast news to the public. The term ``news'' means informationthat is about current events or that would be of current interest to thepublic. Examples of news media entities include television or radio stationsbroadcasting to the public at large and publishers of periodicals (butonly in those instances where they can qualify as disseminators of ``news'')who make their products available for purchase or subscription by the generalpublic. For ``freelance'' journalists to be regarded as working for a newsorganization, they must demonstrate a solid basis for expecting publicationthrough that organization; a publication contract would be the clearestproof, but the Assistance Board will also look to the past publicationrecord of a requester in making this determination. To be eligible forinclusion in this category, a requester also must not be seeking the requestedrecords for a commercial use. In this regard, a request for records supportingthe news dissemination function of the requester will not be consideredto be for a commercial use. (c) <T3>Charges. </T3>In responding to requests under this subpart, the followingfees will be assessed, unless a waiver or reduction of fees has been grantedpursuant to paragraph (e) of this section: (1) <T3>Search. </T3>(i) No search fee will be assessed with respect to requestsby educational institutions, noncommercial scientific institutions, andrepresentatives of the news media (as defined in paragraphs (b) (6), (7)and (8) of this section, respectively).

(ii) <T3>Searches other than for computerized records.</T3> Requesters willbe charged at the salary rate(s) (i.e., basic pay plus 16 percent) of theemployee(s) making the search. However, when a single class of personnelis used exclusively (e.g., all administrative/clerical, or all professional/executive),an average salary (plus 16 percent) may be established and charged. Thischarge will include transportation of personnel and records necessary tothe search at the direct costs. (iii) <T3>Searches for computerized records.</T3> For computer searches of records,which may be undertaken through the use of existing programming, requesterswill be charged the direct costs of the search, including computer searchtime, runs and the operator's salary (basic pay plus 16 percent). The feefor computer printouts will be the direct costs.

(ii) Review fees will be assessed only for the initial record review, i.e.,all of the review undertaken when the Assistance Board analyzes the applicabilityof a particular exemption to a particular record or record portion at theinitial request level. No charge will be assessed for review at the administrativeappeal level of an exemption already applied. However, records or recordportions withheld pursuant to an exemption that is subsequently determinednot to apply may be reviewed again to determine the applicability of otherexemptions not previously considered. The requester may be charged thecosts of such a subsequent review, particularly where that review is madenecessary by a change of circumstances.
