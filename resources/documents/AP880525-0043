In the latest attempt to turn the lessons learned from theaffair into law, the House on Tuesday approved by voice vote a billdesigned chiefly to prevent exports of military equipment toterrorist nations, like Iran.   But the legislation, sent to the Senate, permits the presidentto deal with such countries if he believes the national interest isat stake _ and if he adheres to strict notification requirements toCongress.   Since the bill permits the president some flexibility, theReagan administration does not oppose the legislation, according toadministration foreign policy supporter Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill.   The House bill is the second major attempt by Congress to avoidanother Iran-Contra affair.   The Senate earlier this year passed a bill, which is stillpending in the House, that would require the president to notifyCongress of any covert intelligence operation within 48 hours afterits authorization. Current law merely provides for timelynotification.   The Reagan administration considers that requirement too rigidand opposes the legislation.   The new House bill requires notification to Congress in a muchbroader array of circumstances than just covert actions. Thecoverage would include transfer of weapons and foreign aid money,which may or may not be secret.   In the Iran-Contra affair, President Reagan did not tellCongress he had authorized the sales to Iran until after the secretoperation was revealed in a Middle East publication.   Iran is one of six nations designated by the State Department asa terrorist country. The other countries are Cuba, Iran, Libya,North Korea, North Yemen and Syria.   Current law is supposed to prevent such weapons sales, butfailed to do so.   Hyde, a member of the former House Iran-Contra committee, calledthe bill ``one of the thoughtful responses to the Iran-Contrahearings.   ``One of the big problems (in the Iran-Contra affair) was thetransfer of weapons to the Iranians and nobody knew about it,'' hesaid. ``In this bill, the president still has his constitutionalpower to execute his foreign policy functions.''   The latest bill would prohibit any American from exporting armsto a terrorist state, whether the individual is a governmentemployee, a private citizen or someone acting on behalf of thegovernment.   The secret network that controlled weapons sales to Iran and useof some profits to aid the Nicaraguan Contras was directed byformer National Security Council staffer Oliver L. North. He, inturn, enlisted two businessmen to run the logistics of theoperations: Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakim.   Under the legislation, the State Department would form its listof terrorist nations by determining whether a country repeatedlysupported acts of international terrorism or granted sanctuary tointernational terrorists.   The president could delete a nation from the list. But he mustreport to Congress that a fundamental change in leadership andcharacter has taken place, that the country has not supportedinternational terrorism for the preceding six months, and thatgovernment provided assurances it would not support future acts ofterrorism. The deletion could not take place until 30 days afterthe report was submitted.   The legislation would require a validated license before goodsor technology could be exported to terrorist states, if suchexports would significantly contribute to the military potential ofthe country or enhance its ability to support terrorism.   The State Department must notify Congress 30 days before issuinga validated license.   The president would be able to waive export restrictions fornational security reasons, and could provide foreign assistance toa terrorist nation for humanitarian purposes.   But first, the president must give Congress a 15-day advancenotification, and a report containing all the details of theproposed transaction.   The legislation would retain current penalties for violatingrestrictions on exports or aid to terrorist countries: a maximum of$1 million in fines and 10 years in prison for criminal violations,and up to $500,000 for civil penalties.</TEXT></DOC>
