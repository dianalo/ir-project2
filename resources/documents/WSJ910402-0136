It's a video simulation made with the help of asupercomputer, featuring an innocently rolling buckyball thatsuddenly gets squashed between two walls of hard stuff. Thereis a happy ending, though. After the pressure is eased, theflattened ball pops back into shape, notes Donald Brenner, aresearcher at the Naval Research Laboratory in Washington,D.C., who helped produce the simulation.</LP><TEXT>   Not &quot;Rocky IV&quot; perhaps, but to scientists it is gripping,action-packed entertainment. The buckyball is physicalscience's hottest new star -- it's hitting the gee-whizbutton among physicists and chemists more often than anythinghas since the superconductor breakthrough five years ago.That's partly because the buckies are such oddballs,chemically speaking -- they are only the third pure form ofcarbon to be discovered, after graphite and diamonds. Andtheir unique properties suggest a bounty of commercial uses,including new lubricants, drugs, fuels, batteries andhigh-strength materials.   &quot;I meet many scientists and have been absolutely stunned&quot;by the number working on buckyballs, says Robert D. Johnson,an International Business Machines Corp. researcher studyingthe molecules. By last fall, &quot;every visiting group {ofscientists} was working on this or knew someone who was.&quot;   Buckyballs resemble symmetrical spheres of chicken wirewhen depicted using chemist's ball-and-stick models. Theirmore formal name is buckminsterfullerenes, suggested by theirresemblance to the geodesic domes of architect BuckminsterFuller. Buckyballs are thought to be formed -- at leastfleetingly -- when carbon-containing substances, such ascandles, are burned and make soot. But they weren'tidentified until 1985, when Richard Smalley, a RiceUniversity physical chemist, and colleagues used alaser-zapping technique to spawn and isolate tiny amounts ofthem. With some ideas from Harold Kroto of England'sUniversity of Sussex, Mr. Smalley figured out their structurelate one night by taping together paper polygons in hiskitchen after loosening his imagination with beer.   The buckyball bonanza really started last fall, however,when a team of German and U.S. scientists published an easyway to make the molecules in sizable quantities. Theirtechnique requires little more equipment than an ordinary arcwelder -- a major reason why so many scientists are jumpinginto the buckyball game.   Commercial caution is in order: Buckyball applicationsremain highly speculative for the reason that all the dataaren't in on their basic properties yet. Some possibilitiessuggested in the first flush of excitement already arelooking a little dubious. University of Arizona chemistDonald Huffman, who co-discovered the easy way to makebuckyballs, says he sent some to Edwards Air Force Base inCalifornia to try as rocket fuel. In early tests, &quot;theycouldn't get it to ignite,&quot; he says.   But buckyballs do oxidize and break down when heated. Thatcasts doubt on one early hope: applying the molecules liketiny ball bearings to lubricate hot engine parts. Moreover,they may be too small to lessen the rub between typicalsurfaces. &quot;It might be like trying to lubricate the moonrubbing against the Earth by putting ping-pong balls on themountains,&quot; says Rice's Mr. Smalley.   Still, the tiny balls may be just the thing to lubricategears in &quot;micromotors,&quot; suggests John Weaver, a University ofMinnesota physicist. Such microscopic motors might someday beused in gnat-sized robots designed to clean clogged arteriesand perform other chores in small places.   Unlike other forms of pure carbon, buckyballs dissolve invarious solvents, making them easy to chemically manipulate,says IBM's Mr. Johnson. Thus, it may be fairly easy tocustomize them for certain uses, including lubrication, bychemically combining other atoms or molecules with them.Researchers at the University of California in Berkeleyalready have reported forming a buckyball variant resemblinga purse with a handle. And polymers made from long chains ofchemically altered buckyballs stuck together might provideextra strength in aircraft wings and other places, says Mr.Smalley.   The best-known buckyball contains 60 carbon atoms; butlarger ones, some with hundreds of atoms, also are thought toexist. The size variations may be handy for applicationsbased on the idea of placing atoms or other molecules insidebuckyballs. For instance, radioactive atoms for killingcancer cells might be sheathed in buckyballs before injectionto help protect the atoms while they work against tumors. Andbatteries' charged particles -- their electrically activeingredients -- might last longer by &quot;shrink-wrapping&quot; them inbuckyballs, scientists say.   Recent studies suggest buckyballs themselves can be turnedinto highly charged particles by well-known methods thatstrip away one or more of their carbon atoms' electrons. Thatmeans the balls alone might spawn new kinds of batteries.Charged buckyballs also can be accelerated by electric fields-- if hurled into carbon or other surfaces, they might evenexert enough pressure to form a thin layer of diamond,speculate some researchers; on the other hand, there is someevidence the buckyballs may just bounce off the surface. Akind of Bucky Rogers idea also has been proposed -- blastingcharged buckyballs out the tail of a spacecraft to propel itat high speeds to distant planets.   Farfetched suggestions for applying buckyballs seemnatural as their exotic properties emerge. Among otherthings, the balls appear to be semiconductors -- like thesilicon used in computer chips. And researchers recentlyfound that the balls form exotic crystals resembling hoveringrows of spinning tops. Excitement about such surprises ishelping to dispel a cloud over physics and chemistrylingering from bitter controversy about &quot;cold fusion,&quot; thepotential energy breakthrough that hasn't panned out, saysMark Ross, a researcher at the Naval Research Laboratory. Thenew buckyball game, he adds, is making scientists &quot;likelittle kids again.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
