Meese made the comment as President Reagan asked congressionalleaders on Tuesday for help in creating a bipartisan task force ondrugs.   Reagan has asked that the task force lay out its proposals in areport to him and the congressional leadership within 45 days.   One proposal it will almost certainly examine involvesadditional penalties for passport holders involved with drugs.   Currently, passports can be seized as evidence if someone isfound to be smuggling narcotics into the United States.   But there is no penalty provision to deny convicted narcoticsoffenders their passports.   Meese said he believes a majority of the Cabinet-level NationalDrug Policy Board, which he heads, favors legislation to enact sucha penalty.   He said legislation is being contemplated and that ``we will beproposing a lot of ideas in the course of these meetings withCongress.''   Reagan named White House chief of staff Howard Baker, TreasurySecretary James A. Baker III and national security advisor ColinPowell as well as Meese to the task force.   To date, no members of Congress have been named to the panel.Some members had criticized the proposal as offering morebureaucracy, rather than concrete steps to battle the problem.   Meese, however, said congressional leaders emphasized the needto move quickly and there will be further discussions in the nextfew days.   Meese also told reporters there is ``no softening whatsoever''of the Reagan administration's ``zero tolerance'' anti-drug policy,despite modifications under which the Coast Guard will be morecautious about seizing boats outside the 12-mile limit.   Under the administration's zero tolerance policy, lawenforcement agencies are cracking down on illegal drug use, nomatter how small the amount.   With the new changes, however, vessels outside the 12-mile limitfound to contain drugs will be seized only when there is evidenceof intent to smuggle them into the United States.   ``There have been some operational refinements, but the policyremains the same,'' Meese said.   ``Zero tolerance continues to be our policy both inside andoutside the 12-mile limit,'' Meese said. But the attorney generalacknowledged that federal law ``outside 12 miles does relate toquantities of narcotics indicating an intent to traffic in orsmuggle.''   One idea that has been jettisoned by the Cabinet-level drugpolicy board, according to Meese, is the proposal by the U.S.Customs Service to shoot down planes carrying drug smugglers.   In an interview with The Washington Post on Tuesday, CustomsCommissioner William Von Raab declined to discuss specificanti-drug proposals Customs has made to the drug policy board, butdid call for an all-out fight against drugs.   ``You must treat it like a war _ total mobilization, totalcommitment,'' he told the newspaper. ``When you fight a war, everyman, woman and child should be mobilized to that effort.''</TEXT></DOC>
