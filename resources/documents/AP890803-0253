A recent agreement on reducing the $107 billion foreign debt``has generated confidence in Mexico and desire among manyinvestors to repatriate their capital,'' the Treasury Departmentsaid Wednesday in a statement.   The measures apply to capital returned to the country after Jan.1, 1989.   Officials hope the debt reduction agreement signed with foreigncreditor banks last month will ease economic uncertainty andstimulate the private investment needed to revive Mexico's stagnanteconomy.   The agreement gives the more than 500 creditor banks the optionsof writing off 35 percent of Mexican debt, lowering interest ratesto 6.25 percent or granting Mexico new loans. It covers $53 billionof the debt, which is the second-highest in the developing worldafter Brazil.   Under the Treasury Department decree, deposits abroad over thepast three years earned no taxable income.   It establishes a 3.7 percent tax on deposits or investments madeabroad in 1985 and a 5 percent tax for those made before 1985. Themaximum income tax for private indivduals is 40 percent.   A second decree Wednesday provides tax exemptions for low-pricedcompact cars and imported component parts used to make them. Itapplies to cars that sell for no more than $5,500 and use low-leadgasoline.   ``The high prices of vehicles are outside the reach of mostnational consumers,'' the decree said.   Volkswagen, whose popular ``beetle'' is the lowest-pricedMexican-made car, immediately took advantage of the new regulation,setting its new price at $20 less than the $5,500 limit and $1,377below its previous price.   Morgan Guaranty Trust, one of Mexico's main creditor banks,estimates that $84 billion in capital left the country between 1977and 1987, but a private economist estimated the figure at about $50billion.   Capital flight began when, after years of stability, the pesocurrency was devalued against the U.S. dollar in late 1976.   In 1982, over-borrowing abroad and falling oil prices quicklydeflated the country's oil boom. Mexico could no longer keep upwith its foreign debt payments and the currency began a slide.   In late 1982, about 70 pesos were equal to one U.S. dollar butthat rate is 2,500 to one today.</TEXT></DOC>
