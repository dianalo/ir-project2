The rules are designed to keep strategic products out of thehands of the Soviet Union and its allies.   The countries affected by the change are: Belgium, Luxembourg,Canada, Denmark, West Germany, France, Greece, Italy, Japan, theNetherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Turkey, Britain, Australia,Switzerland and Finland.   All but Switzerland and Finland are U.S. allies and members ofthe Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, asemi-secret organization in Paris.   U.S. authorities said Switzerland and Finland had adopted controlsystems effective enough to be included in the new rules though theydo not belong to the Paris group.   Goods affected are those that can be used for civilian ormilitary purposes and include most kinds of computers, telephoneswitching equipment and some machine tools.   Commerce Department licenses will no longer be required to exportthose goods, nor will the 18 governments have to ask U.S. permissionto re-export the goods to one another. They still will have to askpermission to sell the goods to countries not in the group.   Approval will also still be needed for trade within the group ofsome items such as supercomputers and eavesdropping equipment.   U.S. exporters have long complained about the time and paperworkneeded to get export licenses, especially when other governmentspermitted similar goods to be sold freely.</TEXT></DOC>
