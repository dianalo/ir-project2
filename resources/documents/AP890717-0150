Rostropovich, music director of Washington's National SymphyonyOrchestra, announced the Sept. 18 performance at a news conferencesponsored by conservation groups trying to draw attention to whatthey called a possible ``elephant holocaust.''   ``When I see chairs and tables made with legs of ivory, I think,how inhuman, how barbaric,'' Rostropovich said.   Killing for ivory has reduced the African elephant populationfrom 1.3 million to an estimated 550,000 in the past 10 years, saidDiana E. McMeekin, vice president of the African Wildlife Federation.   The ivory is harvested after the elephants are killed.   Sponsors of the concert at Washington's Kennedy Center for thePerforming Arts predicted it would net at least $400,000, all to beused for elephant conservation projects and investigation into thenetwork of elephant-poaching and ivory trading being outlawed bymany countries.   Christine Stevens, president of the Washington-based AnimalWelfare Institute, described the poachers as ``totally evil butwonderfully well-organized.''   She predicted a fierce battle at the October meeting inSwitzerland of the 102-nation Convention on International Trade inEndangered Species ``to ensure there are no weakening'' movesagainst a proposed total ban on ivory imports.   Japan, the major ivory buyer, and Botswana, South Africa andZimbabwe, the major suppliers, want reservations that would allowthem to trade among themselves.   Many African nations, led by Kenya and Tanzania, supportcurtailing the ivory trade.   Japan accounts for 40 percent of world ivory consumption and theUnited States 15 percent. Japanese use carved ivory for personalsignature stamps as well as jewelry.   In June, Japan banned ivory imports but continues to permitshipments certified by the countries of origin. Ms. Stevens saidsuch a loophole would mean that ``all of the elephants in all ofAfrica will be at risk.''   President Bush issued an executive order June 5 banning U.S.import of ivory from all countries. The West European Community hastaken similar steps.</TEXT></DOC>
