These are, above all,dinitrogene oxide, methane, carbon monoxide, chlorofluoromethanes andthe tropospheric ozone. The contents of these tracer gases in the air,their retention time and absorption bands are given. The rise in thesegases has been proved in different measuring stations. On the basis ofthe future rise in temperature to be expected, it can be stated thatthe climatic effect of all these gases is roughly equal to that of carbondioxide.</TEXT></DOC>
