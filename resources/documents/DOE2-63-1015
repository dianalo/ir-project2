(Non-official headnote of a decision by the FederalConstitutional Court, BVG, 29.7.1988 - 1 BvR 1047/88). The constitutionalcomplaint was raised against the rejection by an administrative court,of an urgent motion aiming at preventing further participation of theTUEV Bavaria as an expert, and of individual civil servants of the licensingauthority, in the then current hearing concerning the licensing of theWackersdorf reprocessing plant (2nd partial construction licence). Admissibilityof the constitutional complaint by the party in question (a foreign publiclaw entity) was considered possible without final examination, but thematter was dismissed due to lack of reasonable prospects of success,as Art. 19 para. 4, sentence 1 of the Basic Law in this case does notoffer legal protection.
