In quartz thisis particularly effective as the nuclear damage soon saturates at {similar_to}5%,and also practically no index change occurs along the initial part ofthe track, thus enabling multiple-energy implants to produce broad, flatbarriers. We report the use of this technique in the construction ofa device with two such barriers at different depths, thus producing apair of overlayed waveguides. The profile of this composite system couldnot be determined by any conventional mode analysis method, and so wehave extended our dark mode reflectivity technique to cope with multiplebarriers. It has proved a very powerful tool for this application, ableto probe at sufficient depth below the surface to supply accurate informationabout the entire double profile.</TEXT></DOC>
