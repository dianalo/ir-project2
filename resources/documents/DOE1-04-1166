The quantities obtained are compared with those for PEG-300,PEG-600 and 1,4-dioxane measured under the same conditions. The hydrogenyields range from about 1 to nearly 2 molecules per 100 eV and ethylenefrom 0.02 to 0.15 depending on the irradiation conditions. From the viewpointof the rate of radiation decomposition, there is not much differencebetween crown ethers and their analogues including 1,4-dioxane, the simplestmolecule in the series. 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
