Because dealers were reluctant to establish significant positions with the end of the year approaching, the currency stayed within a narrow range, traders said. &quot;We've closed our positions, and I think most American banks have closed their books for the year,&quot; said Masakazu Miyamori, senior vice president and chief trader at Sanwa Bank Ltd., New York. &quot;The market is so thin we won't take any positions because we couldn't get out of them if something happens,&quot; he added.    In late New York trading yesterday, the U.S. unit stood at 2.0203 West German marks, up from 2.0163 Monday. The dollar also rose to 164.03 Japanese yen from 163.38.    In early trading in Tokyo Wednesday the dollar rose against the Japanese currency to 164.15 yen from 164.03 in New York yesterday afternoon.    The dollar began climbing in overseas dealings yesterday, hitting its intraday high of 2.0265 marks as New York trading began. The dollar dipped to the day's low of 2.0169 marks following news that U.S. housing starts fell 1.8% in November, to their lowest level since October 1984.    But Arthur C. Agostini, vice president and chief foreign-exchange dealer at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said that &quot;the news was really not of much significance.&quot; He said the dollar appeared to be bouncing between support and resistance points on charts of its recent movements, which are monitored by so-called technical analysts.    The British pound, which had been climbing with oil prices in recent days, eased to $1.4314 from $1.4338, as crude prices slipped back. Britain is a major oil producer.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $2.30 an ounce, to $393.20, in moderate trading. The estimated volume was 3.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $392.45 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                           New York    Home Mkt.

The financial community fearsthe Bundesbank will tighten reins on credit to ensure that1987 monetary policy stays on track.   Inflated by currency speculation and a heavy foreigninvestment in West German instruments, the Bundesbank's moneysupply figure this year consistently has overshot itsassigned growth of 3.5% to 5.5%. In November, the indicatorexpanded at a 7.8% rate, despite the Bundesbank's projectionlast summer that the rate would correct itself as the yearprogressed.</TEXT></DOC>
