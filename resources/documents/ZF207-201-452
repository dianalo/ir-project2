The net result of this restriction is that we now have to pay higherprices for these little critters, and many of our companies can't buildcomputers competitively.andM;These same people are paid to restrict trade so we don't import too manyreliable cars.andP;  Well, now we can buy many unreliable cars that our owncompanies make at much higher prices than they are worth.andP;  Don't ourcompanies build a lot of the parts in other countries anyway?andP;  So who is thenet beneficiary of these policies?andM;They pay for people who make decisions on a health-care and retirement planthat engineers don't seem to have.andP;  Our Social Security taxes are supposed tohumble us when we grow old by keeping us poor.andM;These are the same people who make retirement policies for themselves thatguarantee them an income more than you and I will ever make working fulltime.andM;These same people decide who pays how much.andP;  It seems some people pay morethan others, and it is because these other guys invest in the right thingsand do the right stuff.andM;They pay for (military) research to make sure we don't fall behind.andP;  Iremember reading about the castle that was constantly being invaded.andP;  So theking came up with a plan to defend against the invaders -- he would pour hotoil over the attackers.andP;  But then the bad guys decided that they could attackthe castle and do just as much damage by catapulting rocks into the castle orshooting fiery arrows over the wall.andP;  Well, we don't want the bad guys tohurt the good guys (us).andP;  Or do we?andM;They pay for weapons that are used to arm the freedom fighters in some ThirdWorld nations so that we can prevent the bad guys from getting any strongerthan they already are.andP;  That's good for our national defense.andM;They pay for national security.andP;  We spend a lot of money on spying,intelligence and counterintelligence; things that are illegal for other guysto do in our country.andP;  When we catch someone doing this here, we throw himout.andM;They pay to clean up the air and the garbage that we have created.andP;  Thisgarbage is generated on a regular basis and, at times, is spectacularlytragic, such as the recent oil spill off the Alaskan coast.andP;  You can be sure,Nicholas, that Exxon won't pay for that catastrophic negligence.andP;  Ourlumbering government, which may yet swing ponderously into action, will dothe cleanup work.andP;  Guess who'll pay?andM;They pay to eliminate our national debt, which from what I hear, amounts to$43,000 per family.andM;OK, Nicholas, here's the deal.andP;  If you figure out why I pay taxes, I will payfor your tuition at a fine university with the money left over.andM;----------Aziz Makhani is a free-lance taxpayer who doubles as a systems-engineeringmanager for a company in Southern California.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
