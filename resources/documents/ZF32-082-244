Mills, a systems consultant with The Benjamin/CummingsPublishing Co. in Redwood City, Calif.andP;  Rather than resist platformcollaboration, he said, they've been looking into translation software forgraphics as well as text.andM;&quot;Things like file formats are not problems for us,&quot; said Peter Bloch,president of Interactive Arts, a multimedia and presentation company in SantaMonica, Calif.andP;  &quot;We have about every file conversion utility imaginable, andwe've written some of our own.&quot;andM;Some file formats, such as TIFF and Encapsulated PostScript, are at leastnominally supported on many platforms.andM;On the Mac, programs that use Claris Corp.'s XTND technology can read many ofthe popular PC graphics formats, and some programs, such as Deneba Software'sCanvas 3.0, with its Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) import capability,support a foreign format directly.andM;Some Mac-to-PC connection programs, such as MacLink Plus from DataViz Inc. ofTrumbull, Conn., also can translate between Mac graphics formats and PCstandards such as PC Paintbrush (.PCX) and Lotus graphics (PIC) files.andP;  CGMformat graphics, widely supported on both PC and workstation graphicsplatforms, can be translated to Macintosh format by products such asGraphPorter and MetaPICT from GSC Associates Inc. and PICTure This from FGMInc.andM;The translation also can be done at the PC end with PC-based products such asHijack from Inset Systems Inc. of Danbury, Conn.andM;Commonality.andP;  &quot;If you have products that can run across platforms, and theproducts are fairly consistent, the support is much easier,&quot; said MichaelFontana, a systems specialist at ITT Hartford, the insurance giant based inHartford, Conn.andM;While most current &quot;platform twins&quot; programs are productivity applications,corporate requests and the success of cross-platform graphics packages suchas Aldus PageMaker are sending graphics publishers a strong message.andM;Several PC programs, such as Ventura Publisher, already have Mac companionversions, and Quark Inc. is busy porting QuarkXPress to the Windows platform.andM;&quot;It's a cornerstone of our strategy to make sure all of our technology worksacross platforms,&quot; said John Kunze, director of product marketing for theApplication Products Division of Adobe Systems Inc. in Mountain View, Calif.andO;While PC versions of Illustrator and Photoshop have not been formallyannounced, Kunze said,  &quot;...andP;  we certainly expect to leverage them into thePC marketplace.&quot;andM;According to Jonathan Seybold, president of Seybold Seminars in Malibu,Calif., &quot;There's no question that from the support standpoint, organizationshave a strong rational preference for reducing the number of variables theyhave to deal with.andP;  They've always had a preference for one word processingprogram, one graphics program, one layout program -- it means you developwithin the organization a broader base of skill.&quot;andM;However, Seybold admits, the corporate drive for consistency may collide withthe natural desire of graphic artists to pick their own tools.andM;Perhaps this desire on the part of artists will encourage developers to bringeven more programs into the multiple platform arena.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
