Under the provisions of 42 U.S.C. 10601 (d)(2)(A)(iv), of thefirst $100,000,000 deposited in the Fund in a particular year, 4.5% shallbe available for grants as provided in 42 U.S.C. 10603(a). Under 42 U.S.C.10601(g)(1) the Attorney General, acting through the Director of OVC, isauthorized to use 15% of the funds available under 42 U.S.C. (d)(2)(A)(iv)to make grants for the purposes of assistiang Native American Indian tribesin developing, establishing, and operating programs designed to improvethe handling, investigaiton and prosecution of child abuse cases, especiallychild sexual abuse cases. The Office for Victims of Crime has labeled thisprogram the <T3>Children's Justice Act Discretionary Grant Program for Native Americans</T3>.This is the first year of funding for the Children's Justice Act DiscretionaryGrant Program for Native Americans. The Children's Justice Act of whichthis program is a part was signed into law by President Reagan on August27, 1986. The Act was passed in response to a recognition of the seriousness,complexity and escalating number of children who were reported as victimsof child abuse, especially child sexual abuse.Reports of suspected child sexual abuse and neglect throughout the nationincreased by 225% in the decade between 1976 and 1987. In 1987, over 2million children were reported to authorities as suspected abuse or neglectvictims. Approximately 40% of these reports were eventually substantiated.While much of this dramatic increase of reporting is probably due to anincreased awareness of the nature of abuse and better reporting procedures,many professionals believe that not all cases of child abuse are reported.The authors of the Children's Justice Act recognized that because of thepeculiar nature of child sexual abuse, reports of such abuse require specialinvestigation and prosecution and the victims require special handlingto avoid being further traumatized. However, as a result of the publicityaround a number of cases, many of the authors of the Children's JusticeAct felt that child victims were being unnecessarily traumatized by thejustice system.The Children's Justice Act was designed to address the shortcomings ofthe criminal justice system in investigating and prosecuting child sexualabuse cases. Before a state could be eligible to receive funds from theChildren's Justice Act, it was required to establish or designate a multi-disciplinarytask force dealing with children's justice. Each task force was directedto:andbullet; Review and evaluate State investigative, administrative and judicialhandling of cases of child abuse, especially child sexual abuse.andbullet; Make recommendations in the categories of: investigative, administrativeand judicial handling of cases of child abuse; experimental, model anddemonstration programs for testing innovative approaches; and techniquesto improve the rate of successful prosecution or enhance the effectivenessof judicial and administrative action in child abuse cases.andbullet; Make recommendations regarding the reform of state laws, ordinances,regulations and procedures to provide comprehensive protection for childrenfrom abuse.States that met these criteria were eligible to receive a proportionateshare of Children's Justice Act funds. In FY 87, 25 states shared in $2.8million and in FY 88, 27 states shared in $3.5 million.In 1987, the revelations of sexual abuse of Native American children onreservations and the problems tribes faced in trying to deal with the abusebecame evident. Dealing with child sexual abuse in Indian country was foundto be different and more difficult than dealing with abuse discovered offthe reservations. The difficulties manifested themselves in such issuesas: lack of trained practitioners to investigate, prosecute and treat childsexual abuse cases; geographic isolation; cultural diversity; and a lackof clear understanding of the roles and responsibilities of the variousgovernment entities that had authority to act upon allegations and findingsof child sexual abuse on the reservations.In order to respond more effectively to this situation, the Justice Departmentproposed that Children's Justice Act funds be made available to Indiantribes to improve the handling of child sexual abuse cases. In November1988, President Reagan signed the Anti-Drug Abuse Act of 1988. This legislationamended the Victims of Crime Act by authorizing that 15% of the funds availablefor the Children's Justice Act be utilized to assist native American Indiantribes in developing, establishing and operating programs designed to improvethe handling of child abuse cases, especially child sexual abuse. Underthis program funds will be made directly to Native American tribal organizationsas defined in 25 U.S.C. 450 b (1) to initiate or expand service in Indiancountry.<ITAG tagnum="84">Purpose</ITAG>The Office for Victims of Crime is making $531,000 available through acompetitive process to Native American Indian tribes or other appropriateentities to develop, establish and operate programs, and modify proceduresand practices which would improve the investigation and prosecution ofserious child abuse cases, especially child sexual abuse cases, and improvethe handling of child abuse cases in a manner which avoids additional traumato the child. The Office for Victims of Crime is seeking to bring aboutsystemic improvement in the way child sexual abuse cases are respondedto on the Native American Reservations and other locations where NativeAmericans reside. The agency seeks program models that will foster greatercooperation between all agencies, i.e., law enforcement, prosecutors, health,mental health, social services and victim services that have responsiblityfor investigating, prosecuting and treating the child victims of thesecases while at the same time reducing the trauma inherent in processingthese types of cases. Awards will be made to selected eligible applicants.OVC recognizes that each tribe functions differently. It does not intendto place a considerable number of restrictions on how the tribes may goabout achieving these goals. It is expected, however, that all tribes beactively involved in improving the manner in which these cases are processedat the tribal level. It is also expected that tribes be actively involvedin the manner in which referrals are coordinated with appropriate stateand Federal authorities for prosecution.<ITAG tagnum="84">Eligible Applicants</ITAG>Applications will be accepted from the recognized leader or chief executiveof the tribe. In those cases where the Tribal Council serves as the governingbody, the application must be signed by the Chairman or other recognizedleader of that group. Grants will be limited to Native American Indiantribal organizations as defined in 25 U.S.C. 450 b (1). For this purpose,``tribal organization'' means the recognized governing body of any Indiantribe; any legally established organization of Indians which is controlled,sanctioned, or chartered by such governing body or which is democraticallyelected by the adult members of the Indian community to be served by suchorganization and which includes the maximum participation of Indians inall phases of its activities.There will be two categories of applicants. Applicants will compete onlyagainst those in their respective category. The first category will consistof all tribes that have an established multi-disciplinary Child ProtectionTeam (CPT) that meets on a regularly scheduled basis. The second categorywill consist of those tribes that either have not yet formed a CPT or havean inactive CPT.Selected applicants will not have to contribute any matching funds. However,indirect costs which are often imposed by Indian tribes on Federal grantsare not permissible in VOCA funded victim assistance grant programs. Also,applicants will be required to become part of a consortium consisting ofall other grantees who receive assistance under this initiative. the consortiummembers will meet twice during the life of the grant to discuss mattersrelated to the implementation and operaton of the overall program as wellas their specific grant.<ITAG tagnum="84">Program Description</ITAG>Approximately, eight to ten model projects will be funded. Each projectmust be designed to improve the investigation and prosecution of seriouschild abuse cases, especially child sexual abuse cases, and improve thehandling of these cases in a manner which reduces trauma to the child.Emphasis will be placed upon projects which either develop or expand theuse of multi-disciplinary teams (known in many areas as Child ProtectionTeams) including specialized prosecutorial units for the investigation,referral, and prosecution of child abuse cases.The multi-disciplinary teams which are developed or expanded must includerepresentatives of the tribe and state and Federal agencies that provideservices to the tribe. These multi-disciplinary teams should assist inclarifying roles and responsibilities of all authorition involved in thesecases, including social services, law enforcement, and Federal prosecutors,so that a coordinated system is established to receive and respond to reports.The teams should be comprised of entities that have a role in the identification,initial investigation, treatment and prosecution of child abuse cases,including but not limited to: child protection workers, mental health personnel,police, Federal investigators, prosecutors and medical personnel. Programfunds shall not be used to replace or serve as a substitute for funds alreadyused for existing multi-disciplinary teams.All multi-disciplinary teams will be required to develop and adhere towritten policies regarding the roles and responsibilities of each of theagencies and professionals who participate in cases. The teams will alsobe required to develop procedures for handling all serious child abusecases including all child sexual abuse cases. The primary emphasis shouldbe placed upon child sexual abuse cases. The policies and procedures developedmust employ practices which protect the child victim from further traumawhile improving the probability of a successful investigation and prosecution.Tribes are also encouraged to develop special legal units to advise themulti-disciplinary teams and to prosecute these cases in the tribal courts.The tribal prosecutor should also review the Tribal Codes to ensure theyadequately address the issue of child abuse at the tribal level and thatthey protect the rights of child victims.All special legal funded units that are involved in the prosecution ofchild sexual abuse cases will be required to use techniques that limittrauma to child victims. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Examples of activities that could be funded under this program are:andbullet; The establishment or expansion of a multi-disciplinary team forthe investigation and referral of child abuse cases. If this activity ischosen the applicant must indicate why the tribe has not yet developedsuch a unit.andbullet; The establishment or expansion of a special unit/person to providelegal advice to the multi-disciplinary unit and/or prosecute child abusecases at the tribal level.andbullet; Training of multi-disciplinary teams and/or special legal counselin commonly accepted innovative procedures for investigating and prosecutingchild sexual abuse cases.andbullet; Development of formal protocols among all parties involved inthe investigation, referral, prosecution and treatment of child abuse cases.This includes funding for bringing representatives from the Federal, stateand local agencies together to discuss and formulate formal policies andprocedures for handling these cases.andbullet; Development of treatment plans for victims of child abuse, toinclude payment for services not normally available to the tribe.andbullet; Recommendations and plans for revision of tribal laws, rules andprocedures to recognize the serious nature of child abuse, especially childsexual abuse.<ITAG tagnum="84">Selection Criteria</ITAG>All applicants will be placed in one of two established categories: (1)Those with active CPTs or (2) those who either do not have a CPT or haveone that is inactive. The selection criteria for both groups will be identical;however, applicants will be required only to compete against other applicantsin the same category. In determining which applications to fund, OVC willconsider the following:1. The need for such a program. Please indicate the following: the numberof reported cases of child abuse and child sexual abuse over a period oftime (information should be provided for the latest year complete informationis available), the number of cases investigated, the number of childrenfound to have been abused, the number of persons referred for prosecutionand the number actually prosecuted. (20 points)2. Cost effectiveness of the project. Cost effectiveness will be basedupon review of a budget which accurately reflects how grant funds willbe used to promote the effective handling, investigation and prosecutionof cases. (20 points)3. The appropriateness and soundness of program design. Appropriatenessand soundness will be based upon such factors as: evidence of cooperationbetween tribal, local, state and Federal agencies and officials, including,where appropriate, the U.S. Attorney who has responsibility for prosecutingFederal crimes; where available written guidelines should be presentedas evidence of previous cooperative efforts; description of the processto be used to coordinate activities among all agencies/individuals thathave responsibility for dealing with child abuse cases and the relevanceof program activities to the identified need. (30 points)4. Evidence of a need and willingness to change current procedures, practices,laws and/or tribal codes in order to improve the investigation and prosecutionof child abuse cases and reduce the trauma inherent in such prosecution.(20 points)5. Description of how the efforts contemplated under this program willbe continued when program funds expire. (10 points)Each application will be scored based upon the above named criteria. Applicationsreceiving the highest score in each group will be funded. OVC anticipatesawarding approximately four to five grants in each group, for a total ofeight to ten projects.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applications</ITAG>Applicants should submit three (3) copies of their completed proposal bythe deadline established above.
