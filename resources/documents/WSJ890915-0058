Yesterday, activists in San Francisco, London and New York staged demonstrations attacking Burroughs Wellcome and its parent, London-based Wellcome PLC, as corporate extortionists. Five AIDS activists chained themselves to a balcony inside the New York Stock Exchange, sounding a horn to drown out the opening bell and unfurling a banner that read: &quot;Sell Wellcome.&quot; Protesters also invaded pharmacies, pasting other Wellcome products with stickers reading &quot;AIDS Profiteer.&quot;    The company is accused by activists and some health-care providers of reaping unseemly profits from AIDS patients and federally funded Medicaid by keeping the price of AZT, or azidothymidine, at a level that makes it one of the most expensive drugs ever sold -- about $8,000 for a year's supply per patient.    Driven in part by AZT, Wellcome's profits have doubled in the three years ended Aug. 27, 1988, to $198 million in its most recent fiscal year, and a bigger bonanza is just around the corner. As a result of a recent study confirming that AZT helps people who are infected with the lethal virus but not yet showing symptoms, the Food and Drug Administration is expected to authorize the compound for sale to hundreds of thousands, rather than just the tens of thousands who are sick with AIDS.    At the current price, Wellcome could generate $1.2 billion of AZT sales in 1992, with about half of that flowing to the bottom line as net profit. When the medical study was announced Aug. 18, Wellcome's stock jumped 32% in London trading.    People familiar with the FDA approval process think it is almost inevitable that Wellcome will cut the price of AZT after it is allowed to sell to the wider market, though by how much is unclear. But many AIDS patients and doctors believe Wellcome has already made too much money at the expense of the sick, pricing their drug so far out of the reach of some indigent and moderate-income people that the federal government has had to step in with hundreds of millions of dollars in subsidies -- money that further bolsters Wellcome's profits.    &quot;Wellcome is involved in shameless profiteering,&quot; contends Curtis Morriss, administrator of the infectious-disease clinic at Atlanta's charity hospital, Grady Memorial. &quot;They ought to be ashamed.&quot;    Particularly galling to Wellcome's many critics is that the AZT profits are something of a windfall for the company. Wellcome acquired AZT years ago. But it didn't create the compound, it wasn't the first to discover its effectiveness against AIDS-type &quot;retroviruses,&quot; it didn't uncover its effectiveness against AIDS itself and it didn't conduct the first human tests. Much of that work was done by other scientists, some at the National Institutes of Health with federal financing.    It is also a curious irony that Wellcome is being vilified as an AIDS profiteer, for most of its dividends go to charity, and much of its retained profits to research and development. It is 75%-owned by the Wellcome Trust, a charitable organization that has spent millions aiding pharmaceutical research and other causes.    The company pays out about 25% of its earnings in dividends, mostly to the trust, and spends heavily on research and development of experimental drugs for a wide range of diseases, including cancer, sickle cell anemia and multiple sclerosis. Its drug acyclovir is a leading treatment of herpes.    Moreover, analysts believe that Wellcome's gross profit margins on AZT, while very high at 70% to 80%, are in line with what other companies get from major new drugs. High returns are needed to finance research and development, and pay for &quot;dry holes&quot; -- the many drugs that never reach market. Wellcome's main defense has been that it needs to recoup its upfront investment in AZT, which included paying for a major clinical trial, initially giving the drug free to as many as 5,000 AIDS patients and spending $80 million on a new plant and raw materials.    &quot;There is a myth out there that we're robber barons, ripping people off,&quot; contends David Barry, vice president, research development and medical affairs of the Burroughs Wellcome unit, based in Atlanta. &quot;It would be theoretically possible for us to give away all our drug,&quot; Dr. Barry says. &quot;Everyone would get it for a while, and then we'd go bankrupt.&quot;    Demonstrations and talks with activists notwithstanding, he says there will be no &quot;knee-jerk&quot; concessions on AZT's price. He cautions the potential bonanza may be offset by several recent studies suggesting the drug may be just as effective at half the dose, thus cutting the annual cost to the patient to $4,000 or less. Wellcome also may be hurt by a forthcoming anti-AIDS competitor, Bristol-Myers Co.'s DDI, or dideoxyinosine, which is still being tested.    &quot;If there were a decision to lower price,&quot; Dr. Barry says, &quot;it would be on a rational, quantitative basis.&quot;    Nonetheless, what started out as a triumph for Wellcome has turned into a public-relations disaster, and sparked a raging debate that raises many troubling questions about medical ethics, government policy and the role of private enterprise in drug development. Among other things, the flap promises to change the terms under which the government supports corporate drug research.    Wellcome isn't alone in its dilemma. Dr. Barry is quick to point out that interferon therapy offered by companies like Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. for treatment of an AIDS-related tumor can run $9,800 a year per patient. Moreover, Genentech Inc. made headlines when it priced its heart-attack drug, TPA, at $2,200 a dose.    But Wellcome has several unusual problems. The gay communities heavily affected by the AIDS virus are highly organized and politically adroit, unlike most other patient populations. Their target, Wellcome, is increasingly unable to mount a credible defense based on the argument that it needs to recoup its AZT investment. It has already been greatly enriched by its role in treating the epidemic. In the fiscal year ended in August, Wellcome logged AZT sales of about $220 million, and profit of about $100 million, analysts believe.    The profits for that single year would more than recoup all of Wellcome's initial investment in plant, equipment and materials for AZT. By 1992 analysts suggest AZT's annual sales could quintuple to more than $1 billion a year. Such blockbuster status is attained by few products.    Some critics say that while a high return may be justifiable for lower-cost drugs, it is less so when it puts out of reach a drug that helps an expanding number of sufferers of a lethal epidemic, an epidemic that by its nature also financially cripples those people.    Matthew Ward, a 38-year-old writer in New York, has been taking AZT for 2 1/2 years, and has exhausted his own and friends' funds to buy it. &quot;One of the most dispiriting things was to have to get together that amount of money -- $800 a month -- in the midst of being ill,&quot; he says.    Business-as-usual isn't good enough, argues Peter Staley, a member of AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or ACT UP. Mr. Staley, who was one of the five activists who chained themselves to the balcony of the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, says, &quot;There's a difference between a $500 drug sold at 80% margins and an $8,000 drug sold at 80% margins,&quot; he says. &quot;We have a drug that could slow a world-wide epidemic, and it's being sold only to the people and the countries that can afford it. Africa isn't getting AZT.&quot;    &quot;Many patients still can't get AZT,&quot; adds Joseph Wilber, physician and medical director of the AIDS Program of the Georgia Department of Public Health. &quot;We have 18 patients in Savannah who doctors think should get AZT but there's no source. We've used up all our federal money.&quot; Moreover, because the FDA hasn't cleared AZT for use in children, the government hasn't set aside subsidies to buy the drug for this group. Therefore, a poor parent might get subsidized AZT but his child might not.    Dr. Barry insists Wellcome has been a model of compassion, distributing AZT free prior to its initial marketing approval and launching a patient assistance program for the uninsured -- though activists charge the program is so cumbersome only 300 people have actually used it. He points out that the company did cut AZT's price in December 1987, lowering the retail price to $8,000 from $10,000.    But Wellcome's moral position is undercut by the fact that much of the important work on AZT was done by others. The creator of the drug was Jerome P. Horwitz, chemistry chairman of the Michigan Cancer Foundation, who in 1964 synthesized the compound through grants from the National Institutes of Health and the local United Way chapter. AZT failed as a cancer therapy, and Mr. Horwitz's recipe was never patented, thus casting the compound into the public domain, where it remained for 20 years, a drug in search of a use.    Wellcome synthesized some AZT from the formula and began to explore its use, first as an antibacterial drug and later as an antiviral. Others were looking at it too.    Far from Wellcome's labs and long before AIDS struck, a West German scientist made a prescient finding. W. Ostertag and co-workers at the Max Planck Institute for Experimental Medicine in 1974 published a study showing AZT in the test tube could block Friend leukemia virus, a mouse virus which, like AIDS, belongs to the class of so-called retroviruses, which transfer their genetic infomation in a backward fashion from RNA to DNA. A decade later, Wellcome confirmed his finding.    When the epidemic hit, few companies had labs equipped to handle live AIDS virus. So the government took the lead. At its National Cancer Institute, then-chief of clinical oncology Samuel Broder asked companies to send in candidate anti-AIDS compounds for screening. Among many samples sent was AZT, under the code name &quot;compound S.&quot; In a screening system developed by NCI scientist Hiroaki Mitsuya, AZT wiped out the virus. In July 1985, Dr. Broder and his colleague Robert Yarchoan administered the first dose to a human being.    Wellcome complains that the government's role has been overstated. The company's 1988 annual report devotes a full page of text to clarifying this &quot;misunderstanding&quot; and defending its antiviral efforts and expertise. Dr. Barry grants there was a good deal of &quot;collegial collaboration,&quot; but insists, &quot;This is our drug.&quot;    Wellcome performed toxicology, pharmacology and animal studies before AZT was given to the first human volunteer, he says, and financed the big, multi-center clinical trial in patients, as well as bankrolling a giveaway to 5,000 people prior to FDA approval.    But Wellcome still refuses to disclose its actual cost of development and production. In early 1987, Dr. Barry said raw materials and a sophisticated new plant had cost $80 million, but today company officials say that figure was incomplete, and omits ongoing research. Asked for a total, a spokeswoman, as a guide, simply repeats the industry average for any drug of $125 million.    &quot;Why don't they release their numbers?&quot; demands Larry Kramer, a playwright and founder of ACT UP. &quot;Do they expect us to believe them at face value?&quot;    Disclosure would only engender &quot;false and misleading calculations,&quot; Dr. Barry replies. &quot;Whatever number you give out, it'll be used to mislead.&quot;    Wellcome is now under pressure on many fronts to cut its price. AIDS activists are considering litigation challenging the company's patent, and its biggest customer, the U.S. government, is distinctly restive. Under Medicaid and other subsidy programs, the U.S. has already spent $320 million funding purchases of the drug. (An article in today's edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association estimates that total annual costs for early treatment of AIDS-infected people in the U.S. could run as high as $5 billion to $10 billion, mostly for AZT.)    Government attorneys are mulling over a wartime statute permitting the government to allow patent infringement by other companies when its own procurement of a product is threatened by the activities of a single supplier. Also, activists could sue to revoke AZT's designation as an orphan drug, that is, a drug designed to treat a relatively small group of people. Orphan-drug development is encouraged by tax breaks and guarantees of exclusive marketing rights for seven years.    A more likely tack is public jawboning. Rep. Henry Waxman, a California Democrat who held hearings on AZT's price in early 1987, last week wrote the company, serving notice that Wellcome's original price rationale -- achieving a decent return on investment during a short product life -- no longer exists as the drug approaches its third anniversary and a burgeoning marketplace.    &quot;The continued high price of the drug now appears to be an attempt to charge whatever patients, governments and insurers can scrape together because they are desperate and have no alternative,&quot; Rep. Waxman wrote to Burroughs Wellcome's president, T.E. Haigler. He said that was inappropriate in light of all the government help Wellcome received, and warned that his subcommittee on health and the environment may reopen hearings into AZT's price.    The FDA may play the biggest role in bringing AZT's price down. Drug analysts believe that Wellcome inevitably will cut its price -- conditioned on the FDA's expanding the approved use of AZT to people who are infected by the virus but haven't shown any symptoms. &quot;It isn't a quid pro quo, and you don't ever say it,&quot; says Samuel Isaly, a drug-company consultant. &quot;It's done with winks and nods.&quot;    But scientists and ethicists warn that singling out one drug company, or one disease, for special treatment could be counterproductive in the long run.    &quot;I believe in letting companies have a reasonable return. But where does one draw the line and say you've made enough profit, and now it's unseemly?&quot; asks Peter Jensen, chief of infectious diseases of the San Francisco VA Hospital. &quot;Anytime you regulate, you risk killing the goose that laid the golden egg.&quot;    &quot;Perhaps business as usual isn't good enough,&quot; adds Robert Levine, a Yale University ethicist and professor of medicine. But he is troubled by the ad hoc &quot;patchwork&quot; of subsidies for AIDS that leaves deeper policy questions unsettled. &quot;Whether the epidemic should change ordinary business assumptions isn't something society has addressed very carefully. We have many diseases as lethal as AIDS. If you change expectations for AIDS, should we also change them for cancer?&quot; He warns against strangling creativity with over-regulation.    Many in Washington feel that perhaps the easiest way out of the dilemma is for the government to aggressively foster alternative drugs, letting the resulting competition drive down the cost rather than resorting to price controls. But just in case, Dr. Broder, now the National Cancer Institute's director, also wrote a &quot;reasonable price&quot; clause into all future licensing agreements covering transfer of an NIH-invented compound to a company for development.    Bristol-Myers's DDI, licensed from the cancer institute, is covered by such a clause, and some analysts believe it will eventually be sold at a substantial discount to AZT as a result.    No one is certain how the &quot;reasonable price&quot; clause would be enforced. However, an unduly high price could trigger a government order for a company to open its books. Any company found in violation could be sued by the government for breach of contract.    &quot;It puts a company on notice that care should be exercised in pricing,&quot; says Barney Lepovetsky, the National Cancer Institute's director of technology development. &quot;That moral position is established.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
