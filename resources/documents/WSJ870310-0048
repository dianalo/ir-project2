Separately, the consumer and industrial products concern reported that its net loss for the fourth quarter ended Dec. 28 widened to $165.7 million from $52.8 million a year earlier. For all of 1986, Allegheny had a net loss of $164 million, compared with a $109.1 million loss a year earlier.    The buyout proposal calls for common stock shareholders to receive $24.60 a share. Holders of Allegheny's $2.19 cumulative preference stock would get $20 a share and holders of the $11.25 convertible preferred stock would get $87.50 a share.    News of the agreement sent Allegheny's shares soaring yesterday on the New Stock Stock Exchange. In composite trading, the stock closed at $24 a share, up $8.625, on heavy volume of about 2.7 million shares.    Though Allegheny's move to go private is structured as a typical leveraged buyout, the company's top management currently isn't involved. Instead, Sunter Holdings, a special acquisition corporation formed by First Boston Corp., will be the company's new owners.    A spokesman for the Boston-based investment banking concern said, however, that he expects Allegheny's top management ultimately will be included in the arrangement with an equity position in the holding company.    &quot;We're on the same wavelength as management,&quot; the spokesman said, adding that changes in top management aren't anticipated. &quot;We think the company is attractive.&quot; The spokesman also said First Boston favors Allegheny's recent strategy of selling its high-technology industrial specialties and focusing on its North American consumer products operations.    Under the buyout plan, Sunter intends to begin a cash tender offer for all of Allegheny's shares outstanding by Friday. By then, Allegheny said, it will have received a waiver from its lending banks of certain conditions in its loan agreement. The buyout plan is contingent on Allegheny receiving that waiver.    The surprise buyout agreement was welcomed by shareholders, who have been increasingly frustrated by Allegheny's poor earnings and by published reports of corporate waste by former management.    &quot;I'm quite pleased that someone else recognized some value&quot; in Allegheny, said William Miller, investment manager at Legg Mason Wood Walker Inc., a unit of which owns a significant stake in Allegheny. Some analysts said they believe the company, whose major consumer products operation is Sunbeam Corp., could have a value of $30 to $40 a share.    Allegheny's banks, which have been closely monitoring the company's balance sheet, apparently were caught off guard by yesterday's announcement. Bank sources, comforted by First Boston's deep financial pockets, said the agreement sounded excellent but emphasized they would have to examine the details.    The company's lenders were scheduled to meet with Allegheny officials last week to discuss a forthcoming deadline to pay down about $335 million of debt, but the meeting was postponed until this week. Allegheny, which has been working with lenders to reduce its total of $800 million in bank debt, might not be able to meet the deadline, bank sources said. An Allegheny official said the company has to renegotiate its revolving credit agreement with the banks by April 28, but didn't elaborate.    Not everyone applauded the agreement. Gregory Drahuschak, an analyst with Butcher andamp; Singer Inc., said he thinks the company could have made the turnaround on its own. He pointed to a 50% increase in operating profit last year of Allegheny's U.S. and Canadian consumer operations -- increasingly the core of its business -- to $71.1 million from $47.3 million in 1985.    &quot;I think they threw in the towel,&quot; Mr. Drahuschak said of Allegheny's management and board.    Allegheny, confirming rumors, said it will sell its London-based Wilkinson Sword unit, which makes razors and blades. The company disclosed that it had signed letters of intent to sell Wilkinson to a buyer whose identity wasn't disclosed and to sell its Pacific appliance group, which includes the Australian unit of Sunbeam, to Reil Corp Ltd., of Sydney. Terms of both sales weren't disclosed, although analysts have estimated that Wilkinson could fetch $160 million to $200 million.    Allegheny, in posting its 1986 fourth quarter and full-year results, said the latest quarter's net loss included a $13.7 million loss from discontinued operations and an extraordinary charge of $1.1 million from the reversal of tax-loss carry-forwards. The year-earlier quarter included a loss from discontinued operations of $15 million. Sales in the latest quarter fell 12% to $346.1 million from $392.5 million.    For all of 1986, Allegheny posted earnings from discontinued operations of $34.1 million. The 1985 loss included a loss from discontinued operations of $26.9 million. Sales fell 8.2% to $1.33 billion from $1.45 billion in 1985. </TEXT></DOC>
