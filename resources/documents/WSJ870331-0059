A Henley spokesman said the company purchased 7,907,700 shares before Dec. 31, 1986, at an average price of $32.98 each, or a total of about $261 million. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Santa Fe Southern shares closed at $38, up $1.875, on volume of 1.5 million shares.    &quot;It's an investment and we're happy with it,&quot; the spokesman said. He said Henley hasn't bought or sold any Santa Fe Southern shares this year, but he declined to comment further.    In Chicago, John J. Schmidt, chairman and chief executive officer of Santa Fe Southern, said that Henley informed him that it likes the company and purchased the stock as an investment. Santa Fe Southern is a railroad and natural-resources concern.    Henley, which has interests in engineering and financial services, disclosed the holding in its 1986 form 10-K annual report, which it filed Friday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Henley said it wasn't required to file a form 13-D with the SEC, which is required when an investor acquires more than a 5% stake in a company, because its stake represented less than 5% before Santa Fe Southern recently bought back some of its stock. </TEXT></DOC>
