Shares rose to another record in Sydney but slipped in Tokyo on profit-taking in heavy trading. Frankfurt, Singapore and Hong Kong all posted declines.    London's 100-share index gained 24.7 to 2304.5. The Financial Times 30-share index rose 21.8 to 1812. The gold mines index fell 4.5 to 442.7. Volume was 627 million shares, compared with 538.6 million Wednesday.    Dealers said bullish sentiment continued in the wake of Wednesday's reports on British government borrowing and industrial production. The figures indicated that economic growth remains strong and that borrowing needs could be less than expected this year, which would boost hopes for a tax cut next year.    Unemployment and revised secondquarter current-account data released yesterday were also favorable, dealers said.    &quot;People's confidence in the market has increased a lot recently,&quot; one dealer said.    However, market participants said they are focusing on today's reports on the money supply and bank lending for a stronger indication of the market's shortterm direction.    Among major gainers, Rio Tinto Zinc rose 30 pence to 1,388 pence ($22.85) a share after reporting that first-half pretax profit rose 11% in the first half to #254.5 million ($418.9 million). Dealers said some investors were switching into RTZ from Consolidated Gold Fields, which fell 15 to 1,465.    Glaxo Holdings rose 38 to 1,765. The company said it reached agreement with Japan's Mochida Pharmaceutical to jointly develop, manufacture and market an antibiotic drug. Peninsular andamp; Oriental Steam Navigation rose 22 to 711 after a buy recommendation from brokerage Nomura International.    Insurers continued to gain after Wednesday's news that Australian financier John Spalvins controls 5.1% of Royal Insurance. Royal's shares gained 10 to 575, General Accident rose 30 to 1,123, Guardian Royal Exchange jumped 28 to 1,058, and Sun Alliance andamp; London Insurance rose 21 to 1,139. Reckitt andamp; Colman fell 27 to 1,085 after reporting pretax profit rose to #74.5 million in the first half from #62.1 million.    Tokyo's Nikkei stock average, which rose 13.71 Wednesday, fell 112.42 to 24855.31. Volume was 1.1 billion shares, compared with 750 million Wednesday. The Tokyo Stock Exchange first section index fell 10.49, or 0.51%, to 2051.22.    Traders said they were puzzled by the market's fall in the absence of any significant economic news. Volume was heavy, with export-led shares accounting for much of the decline. Steel, machinery, tool and chemical shares closed higher.    Toshiba, which rose Wednesday on speculation that the U.S. Congress won't retaliate as severely as was feared earlier for a Toshiba affiliate's sales of sensitive equipment to the Soviet Union, fell 3 to 741 yen ($5.15) a share.    Toyota Motor fell 30 to 1,980, and Honda Motor fell 30 to 1,560. Kawasaki Steel rose 7 to 324, and Nippon Steel rose 9 to 386. Sumitomo Chemical rose 23 to 927. Machine tool maker Tsugami gained 2 to 732.    In Frankfurt, shares fell for the second day in a row as investors reacted to Wednesday's 36.39-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Volume was even lighter than the &quot;minimal&quot; trading reported Wednesday.    Among electrical issues, AEG-Telefunken rose 3 to 340 marks ($187.50) a share after saying it expects flat profit for the year. Siemens fell 5 to 656.    Sportswear maker Puma gained 25 to 375, but retailer Asko was down 50 to 905 after a poor response to its one-for-one rights issue.    The Australian stock market rose to another record, with gains concentrated in industrial shares and companies announcing profit gains. Australian National Industries rose 0.22 to 2.92 Australian dollars ($2.14) a share after posting an 18% rise in profit for its latest year. Pacific Dunlop, which posted a profit gain Wednesday, gained 0.30 to 6.    Construction and property shares remained strong. They are benefiting from lower interest rates after this week's news of a much narrower government budget deficit as well as from tax changes. Lend Lease gained 0.40 to 19, and Jennings Industries advanced 0.18 to 3.10. Building materials supplier Boral rose 0.12 to 6.80. James Hardie Industries moved up 0.10 to 4.80.    National Australia Bank firmed 0.06 to 6.10. Its board said it opposes Adelaide Steamship's plan to raise its stake in the bank to 15% from 9.8%. Adelaide Steamship advanced 0.30 to 11.10, and its David Jones unit added 0.30 to 14.40.    Hong Kong shares dropped for the fourth consecutive session as rumors of rights issues by major companies again depressed the market. Turnover was heavy, with the property and commercial-industrial sectors posting the biggest losses.    Singapore stocks also continued to drop in profit-taking, but volume remained light. Some bargain-hunting emerged near the close, bringing the market up from its lows for the day.    Stocks rose in Milan, with foreign investors encouraged by the renewed stability of the Italian lira. Shares fell in Brussels, Amsterdam and Stockholm and were mixed in Paris and Zurich.
