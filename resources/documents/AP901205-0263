The 8.1-ounce cellular phone, to be made by four Japaneseelectronics companies, can carry a continuous conversation for 45minutes, NTT said.   New miniaturized low-power circuitry is used to cut its size to9.2 cubic inches, compared with 13.5 cubic inches for MotorolaInc.'s MicroTac telephone, it said.   The MicroTac, which the U.S. company says is the world'ssmallest cellular phone, weighs 10.7 ounces and can transmit for upto 30 minutes with its slim-sized battery, and up to 100 minuteswith a slightly thicker battery, Motorola spokesman David Pinskysaid. Motorola introduced MicroTac two years ago.   Pinsky, speaking from his company's Schaumburg, Ill.,headquarters, said Motorola would have no comment on the NTT phoneuntil it receives more information on it.   ``The new phone comes out on top in all three areas - size,weight and battery life,'' said NTT's Kazuyoshi Terada. ``Afterfeeling melancholy for two years, we now can feel proud abouthaving the best portable phone.''   The phone is about one-third the size and weight of the smallestmodel currently marketed by NTT, Japan's main telephone company.   It will be available in four designs containing the sameNTT-developed circuitry, each manufactured by a different Japaneseelectronics firm. The four companies are NEC Corp., MatsushitaElectric, Mitsubishi Electric and Fujitsu, NTT said.   The phone features automatic dialing, message notification byeither audio or light signals, and a selection of three differentmessage notification tones. It also has a built-in electronicmemory for storing up to 100 names and telephone numbers.   NTT said it plans to begin marketing the telephone in Japan inApril. Although it will not sell the phone overseas, the companiesthat participated in its development may market similar productsoutside Japan in the future, Terada said.   NTT said it was able to reduce the volume of radio parts in thephone by about one-half by developing new high-density integratedcircuits and reducing the size of other components. However, thephone contains two separate receivers and antennas, including oneinside the case, and can automatically pick the stronger of the twosignals to improve reception, it said.   The phone saves battery power by automatically limitingtransmission strength to the minimum amount needed. Transmissionpower is a maximum 0.6 watts, the same as in the MicroTac, NTTsaid.   The new NTT phone, like most existing cellular phones, usesanalog technology, while digital technology, which allows many morecallers to use te service at once, is considered the wave of thefuture.   Motorola's digital voice-coder technology was selected lastsummer as the future Japanese national standard, a move that helpeddefuse trade tensions over Japan's cellular telephone market.   Those tensions also were eased when the Japanese governmentagreed in June to allow Motorola's analog cellular technology to beused on frequencies in the Tokyo area, which had been limited toNTT technology.   Previously, Motorola supplied analog cellular equipment to NTTand other Japanese companies only outside Tokyo.</TEXT></DOC>
