Manuel Antonio Noriega.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said administrationofficials ``want to reiterate our unqualified support for civilianconstitutional rule in Panama.''   ``There is but one legitimate sovereign authority in Panama andthat is the Panamanian people exercising their democratic right tovote and elect their leadership in a free society,'' Fitzwater saidin a formal statement released not long reports surfaced fromPanama City saying that President Eric Arturo Delvalle haddismissed Noriega.   There was no immediate comment from the White House or StateDepartment early Friday after the Panama's legislative assemblyremoved Delvalle and the vice president from office.   A senior U.S. official said that as of Thursday night, the majorunanswered question was whether Noriega would attempt to fight hisouster.   Initial reports indicated that Noriega did not intend to goquietly, the official said, citing a television newscast in Panamain which a member of the Defense Forces said that if anyone isremoved from power, it should be Delvalle.   The official, insisting on anonymity, said it was hisunderstanding that Col. Marcos Justine, Noriega's designatedsuccessor, is almost as tainted by corrupt activities as is Noriega.   Sen. Alphonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who participated in acongressional investigation of Noreiga, said U.S. militaryintervention might be in order to support Panama's civiliangovernment if Noriega decides to cling to power or attempts a coup.   But he said he has no indication whether the Reaganadministration might initiate military action against Noreiga oract on any request from Delvalle.   ``We're not without leverage,'' D'Amato said in an interview.``There are 10,000 U.S. troops under arms in Panama'' guarding thePanama Canal.   ``I am suggesting that there have been times in the past when wehave been asked to intervene by a legitimate government,'' D'Amatosaid. ``I don't think we should write off that possibility. That'sa very real option.''   At the Pentagon, a spokeswoman said the U.S. Southern Command inPanama had issued a ``personnel movement'' alert Thursday night asa precaution.   Capt. Nancy LaLuntas said the command had issued a ``Bravo''alert, which orders American military personnel and dependents to``decrease their visibility.''   A Bravo alert specifies that ``some civil disturbance activityis probable. Reduce the amount of time spent in public areas ofPanama. If you do not live on a defense site or military area ofcoordination, stay around your residence unless traveling to andfrom work or conducting personal business in a non-affected area.''   LaLuntas said there are two higher levels of alert, one whichorders travel to be confined to essential business and anotherwhich suspends travel.   She said the U.S. Southern Command in Panama had receivedreports of scattered demonstrations in and around Panama City.   ``U.S. personnel ... are also being reminded that under theterms of the (Panama Canal) treaty, we are not to interfere in theinternal affairs of Panama,'' she said.   Delvalle's move was applauded on Capitol Hill, but with somereservation.   Rep. Charles Rangel, D-N.Y., head of the House Select Committeeon Narcotics Abuse and Control, said he believed the Delvalle movewas a direct result of Noriega's indictment in the United States ondrug charges.   ``That was a foreign policy objective, but we used our JusticeDepartment to do it,'' Rangel said. ``That's not the normal way todo things. ... Are we going to conduct foreign policy byindictment?''   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., called Delvalle's action``courageous.''   ``It is constitutional and it deserves the support offreedom-loving people throughout this hemisphere,'' Kennedy said.``There is no doubt about the wishes of the Panamanian people:President Delvalle must be supported and Gen. Noreiga must go.''   ``If Gen. Noreiga persists in power, he will become an outcast _now and for all time _ in Panama and throughout the world,''Kennedy said.   Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., called the announcement ``veryimportant news'' and said the United States should be prepared tohelp Delvalle.   ``I think we have a number of options,'' said Kerry, chairman ofa Foreign Relations subcommittee which held hearings earlier thismonth on Noriega's involvement in drug trafficking   ``The first (option) for the Congress of the United States toimmediately move to a full economic embargo of the country. ...Hopefully, the business community and others in Panama whorecognize the impossibility of surviving in that situation andNoriega himself will find it impossible for him to govern.''   During a nationally broadcast news conference Wednesday night,President Reagan, when asked whether the United States wouldconsider dropping the federal indictment if Noriega stepped aside,replied:   ``No, and I'm not going to comment on something of this kind.This man has been indicted by a federal grand jury, and so I'm notgoing to make any comment of that kind. Nor have we made anyadvances or suggestions of that kind to the government of Panama.''   Reagan said that ``what we would like to see is a return todemocracy and a civilian government in Panama, and not thisdomination by literally a military dictator.''</TEXT></DOC>
