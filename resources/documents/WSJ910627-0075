Next -- the brainchild of Steven Jobs, co-founder of AppleComputer Inc. -- said it expects to post sales of $45 millionto $50 million for its quarter ending Sunday. That puts Nexton target to achieve $200 million in 1991 sales. &quot;This is avery respectable accomplishment,&quot; said Richard Shaffer,editor of Computer Letter. &quot;Steve is beginning to gaincredibility.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But Mr. Jobs, who launched Next in 1985 after leavingApple, isn't out of the woods.   His alliance with International Business Machines Corp. isfoundering. And industry observers believe his company, whileholding substantial cash reserves, isn't profitable yet.Moreover, Mr. Jobs's rebound, while impressive, is fragile.Two important rivals, Sun Microsystems Inc. and SiliconGraphics Inc., are each poised to unveil machines that couldhalt Next's hard-won momentum.   &quot;The Next `gap' is being narrowed,&quot; said Robert Herwick,an analyst at Hambrecht andamp; Quist. &quot;Other vendors areincreasingly offering features that Next had first,&quot; makingit more difficult for Next to sustain its recent pace.   The uncertainty over Mr. Jobs's future is nothing new.Since forming closely held Next, he has led a roller-coastercareer. Initially, he was celebrated as a visionary andapplauded for having the guts to try to create a second hitcompany. But by last year, after the original model of hisNext computer failed miserably with customers, many observersdismissed Next and deposited Mr. Jobs on the scrap heap ofcomputer history. The company introduced improved models lastfall.   Symbolic of Mr. Jobs's dashed hopes: a much-ballyhooeddeal in 1988 in which IBM paid more than $10 million for therights to the first version of Nextstep, the acclaimedsoftware that controls the basic functions of Next'scomputers. As part of the deal, IBM said it would sell aversion of Nextstep along with its own machines, greatlylifting the chances that the software would become amarketplace standard. But IBM has never followed through onits promise to ship Next's software, though as recently aslast September Big Blue restated its intention to back Mr.Jobs.   Today, IBM's support for Mr. Jobs appears to be waning,though Mr. Jobs still wants Big Blue's help. &quot;We really dohope IBM does come out with Nextstep,&quot; Mr. Jobs said in aninterview, but he's hardly confident IBM will. &quot;They may comeout with {it} or they may not,&quot; he said.   While IBM insists it hasn't retreated from its plans tosell Next software with some of its computers, a spokeswomanconceded Big Blue doesn't even hold a license to the newestversion of Next's basic software, released last fall.   IBM's inattention to Mr. Jobs contrasts sharply with theveritable love-fest Big Blue is carrying on with myriad othersoftware suppliers. In recent months, the company hasexpanded its ties with Go Corp., which makes software thatrecognizes handwriting, and inked pacts with Novell Inc. andBorland International Inc.   Big Blue also is talking with Apple Computer about apossible technology exchange. Should the talks bear fruit,the damage to Mr. Jobs could be substantial. As part of thediscussions, Apple is considering abandoning its support fora future family of microprocessors called the 88k fromMotorola Inc. Since Next is believed to be already designingits future computers around the Motorola chips, Apple'sdecision &quot;is kind of scary,&quot; said Mr. Herwick, the analyst.&quot;It means Next is building its future around a processor thatisn't getting any support.&quot;   As for the new Sun and Silicon machines, Sun is expectedto introduce a more powerful version of its popular IPCworkstation computer next month. Later this summer, Siliconwill unveil a new multimedia workstation, code-named&quot;Hollywood&quot; and aimed directly at enthusiasts of Mr. Jobs'smachine.   Despite these approaching problems, Mr. Jobs is gainingthe respect of computer experts and, more importantly,starting to ring up significant sales, mainly at the expenseof Sun.   Next, for instance, recently beat out Sun for a big orderfor 250 computers from the Los Angeles County Sheriff'sDepartment and won a 500-unit order from advertising-agencyBozell Inc. It also won sizable orders from the influentialDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency and from FirstNational Bank of Chicago.   &quot;The Next computer, off-the-shelf and out of the box, doeseverything we need,&quot; said Ricardo Merrick, chief of technicalservices for the Los Angeles County Sheriff.   Next also is getting an enthusiastic reception fromsecurities firms, which are attracted to Nextstep because itlets programmers create custom applications more quickly thanrival software. &quot;We're seeing vendors on Wall Street move toNext,&quot; said Eric Bergerson, a New York consultant. &quot;The earlystigmas {against Next} are disappearing.&quot;   In addition, Next is showing signs of strength overseas,especially in Japan, where Canon Inc., an investor in Next,markets the computers. Already, about 15% of Next's salescome from Japan, &quot;and that's without a Japanese-languageproduct,&quot; Mr. Jobs said. Next has just begun shipping aversion of its software in Japanese.</TEXT></DOC>
