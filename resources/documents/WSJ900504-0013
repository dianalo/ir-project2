The addition, from the proposed sale of Subaru'sauto-lease portfolio, should help wrap up the deal, whichFuji proposed in January. Some Subaru shareholders hadcomplained about the initial price, because it didn't reflectmuch of a premium on Subaru stock. Some of the holders filedlawsuits opposing the terms of the takeover.</LP><TEXT>   Under the unusual definitive agreement, Tokyo-based Fujiwill stick to its original $6 a share offer for full controlof the U.S. company that sells cars Fuji builds. But Subaruwill add to the offer a minimum of $2.50 a share.   Subaru officials said they don't have a buyer lined up forthe leases, but set the $61 million minimum value on theadvice of their investment bankers.   In a joint announcement with Subaru, Toshihiro Tajima,chairman and president of Fuji, said, &quot;Our decision toincrease our offer reflects the desire by Fuji Heavy toconclude this transaction.&quot;   The deal, which the companies expect to complete in thethird quarter of 1990, illustrates a consolidation amongJapanese auto makers smaller than Toyota Motor Corp., NissanMotor Co. and Honda Motor Co.   The larger Japanese car and truck companies areincreasingly pressuring their smaller competitors for salesand market share. Partly in reaction to this, the smallercompanies are looking for more help from overseas partnersand even from some of their larger domestic competitors.   Fuji is a prime example. About three months after Fujilaunched its offer for Subaru, Mr. Tajima announced he wouldstep down from Fuji's top jobs in favor of Isamu Kawai, aformer top executive with Nissan, Fuji's largest shareholder.   The moves amount to a Nissan rescue of Fuji, whichestimated it would complete the year ended March 31 with anoperating loss of nearly 23 billion yen ($145.3 million).That's seven times more than it forecast last fall.   The management changes and Fuji's financial difficultiesadded uncertainty to the Subaru offer Fuji launched inmid-January. Subaru officials had already balked at the bidbecause it offered a thin premium above the market value ofthe stock. The potential class-action suit filed inopposition to terms by some holders was settled as part ofthe definitive agreement.   &quot;It was clear that shareholders and management weren'tready to accept the lower initial price,&quot; said Scott Merlis,an auto analyst with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. &quot;Throwing inproceeds from the sale of the leasing operations was a clevercompromise in very tough negotiations.&quot;   Other analysts said the $8.50 a share aggregate offer ismuch higher than they expected for Subaru shares. The higheroffer pushed Subaru shares higher by $1.625, to close at $8in national over-the-counter trading yesterday.   Subaru hit its sales peak in 1986. But since then, saleshave rapidly deteriorated, forcing Subaru to ante up largebuyer and dealer incentives. Subaru's sales dropped 34%between last year and 1986. The financial shock led to hugelosses in that period for Subaru, the only publicly tradeddistributor of Japanese cars in the U.S.   Fuji officials, with the full backing of Nissan, say theyexpect to improve Subaru's performance and communicationsbetween the U.S. and Japanese operations.   &quot;It's very, very important that we have clearercoordination between product development and sales,&quot; saidAkira Soejima, a Fuji senior managing director in a telephoneinterview. &quot;We're now thinking of new products for the U.S.market and we're trying hard to assist our 750 dealers allover the U.S. market.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
