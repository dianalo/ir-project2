TheIBM Hamiltonian is constructed microscopically in the following two steps.In the first step, the collective nucleon pairs of J = 0{sup +} (S),2{sup +} (D), etc. are mapped onto the corresponding bosons. Nucleon-nucleoninteractions are also mapped onto boson-boson interactions. The mappingmethod for spherical nuclei is reviewed, and the mapping method for deformednuclei, which was recently developed, is discussed in some detail. Low-lyingcollective states primarily consist of S and D pairs. Consequently, thecorresponding boson states mainly consist of s and d bosons, while thereare some admixture of g-bosons. In the second step of the derivationof the IBM Hamiltonian, effects of these g-bosons are included withinthe s-d boson space by a unitary transformation which transforms a combinationof d and g bosons into a new d-boson. It is demonstrated that the s-dHamiltonian thus derived indeed reproduces spectra of the original s-d-gHamiltonian.</TEXT></DOC>
