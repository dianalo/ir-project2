The banks -- County Bank, Manatee County, in Palmetto, Fla., and First State Bank of King City, Mo. -- were closed Friday by state banking authorities, bringing the number of bank failures this year to 27, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said.    On the same day, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board took control of one failed thrift, Universal Savings Association, Chickasha, Okla., and transferred the insured deposits of another, Life Savings of America, Rockford, Ill., to another institution.    County Bank's three offices are to reopen today as branches of NCNB National Bank of Florida, Tampa. The failed bank had assets of $163.9 million and held deposits of $163.2 million in 10,500 accounts. County Bank was the first Florida institution to fail this year.    First State is to reopen today as a branch of Citizens Bank andamp; Trust Co., Chillicothe, Mo. First State had assets of $13.5 million and held deposits of $13.8 million in 2,700 accounts. It was the second bank to fail in Missouri this year.    The Bank Board, which had installed new management at Life Savings in August, declared the thrift insolvent Friday. The institution's insured deposits and 15 branches were taken over by TCF Banking andamp; Savings, Minneapolis. Life had assets of $380 million.    The failed thrift's deposits included an undetermined amount of money in 3,400 accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor. The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. will use the proceeds from the sale of Life Savings' assets to pay those depositors on a pro-rata basis.    Universal was declared insolvent by the Bank Board Friday and reopened Saturday as a newly chartered federal stock association with the same name. The failed thrift has assets totaling $106.3 million.    The new Universal will be operated for the Bank Board under a management contract with First Western Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, Oklahoma City.    Meanwhile, the FDIC on Saturday began paying off the insured deposits of Security National Bank, Midland, Texas. Security National was closed Thursday by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, and the FDIC received no bids to purchase it.    Security had assets of $7.8 million and held deposits of $7.7 million in 2,400 accounts, including $41,000 in 12 accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 per depositor.    Holders of those deposits will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the failed bank's assets. </TEXT></DOC>
