It marked the firsttime a Soviet-bloc Communist Party has dissolved itself.   The resolution presented to the congress stated that the party's``history ... has ended'' and named its successor the HungarianSocialist Party. The new party is to resemble the socialist partiesof West Europe, its founders said.   Of the 1,202 delegates present, 1,005 voted for the motion.There were 159 votes against and 38 abstentions.   Reform Communists have for months urged the party to supporttheir plan to start anew as Hungary prepares for its first freenational elections in 41 years.   The reformers have pointed to shrinking membership _ more than70,000 party members have quit this year alone _ and a series ofby-election losses to newly permited opposition parties in arguingthat only a new, democratic-leftist party can compete successfullyat the polls.   The party leadership's commitment to free elections by June atthe latest, along with the acceptance of international human rightsprovisions, had put Hungary in the forefront of reform within theWarsaw Pact alliance even before Saturday's vote.   Only Poland, with the Soviet bloc's first government notcontrolled by Communists, has come as far as Hungary in itsdemocratic strivings.   The new party, which draws on socialist and communist ideals,supports ``humanism, freedom and democracy,'' the document stated.It seeks alliances with reform-oriented communist parties as wellas socialist and social democratic parties, according to theresolution.   Liberals grouped in the Reform Union faction had urged since thecongress opened Friday that the new party be free of CommunistParty conservatives. However, in a clear attempt to gain broadsupport the position paper avoided direct mention of cleansing ofranks.   It instead ``called into its ranks all those who agree with itsplatform, who accept the ground rules.'' But the document alsoprovided that members of the old party would not automatically bemembers of the new one by proposing that new membership booklets beissued by Nov. 10.   Originally even more wide-ranging in its intention to split withthe past, the reform leadership watered down the document lateSaturday to gain the support of the Platform for Rural EqualOpportunity _ less progressive than the Reform Union but moreliberal than the conservative groupings.   Members of the two liberal factions debated passionately _yelling could be heard from a conference hall at one point _ beforeagreement was reached on the compromise document.   The document declared the new party would support the concept ofboth private and state property, calling for ``a mixed propertysocial market economy,'' and ``the development of ... a multipartyparliamentary democracy.''   Politburo member Janos Barabas told reporters the change wouldnot challenge Hungary's ties with more orthodox Communist Partiesin other Warsaw Pact countries ``with whom we are in an alliancesituation.''   Communist Party chairman Rezsoe Nyers, a moderate reformerappointed in an attempt to bridge ideological differences among thefour-member party leadership, praised the position paper as ``acompromise serving the rebirth of our party as a new left-wingSocialist Party.''   In a surprise turn, Nyers disclosed that former Politburo memberJanos Berecz, one of the most bitter opponents of reform at thecongress, had asked whether there was room for him in the new party.   ``I said `Yes, as a reform Communist,''' Nyers said to cheersfrom some of the delegates.   The strong approval of the document was a blow to conservativesat the congress who had supported plans to make some changes in theexisting party but rejected founding a new one.   Imre Pozsgay, the leading reformer in the four-man partyleadership, had told reporters earlier he was closer to socialdemocratic ideals than traditional communist ones. He said thecommunist principles ``led to a dead end in Eastern Europe,wherever they were tried.''   He described Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's campaignfor restructuring and openness as an encouraging ``wind for ourreforms,'' but emphasized that Hungary's decisions were independentof other countries.   Pozsgay has been the party candidate for the newly createdgovernment post of president in the planned elections.   Premier Miklos Nemeth, also a reformer and member of thecollective party leadership, told the delegates that the new partywould have no room ``for those who have blood on their hands'' frompast Communist Party excesses.   Another test of reform and conservative strength at the congresswas expected Sunday in voting on leadership posts.   Reformers, with nearly 500 committed delegates, represent thestrongest faction at the congress, with staunch conservativesnumbering less than 100.   But several reformers said the conservatives were continuingefforts to win over hundreds of uncommitted delegates.</TEXT></DOC>
