Accordingly, the provisions of 5 U.S.C.553 do not apply and no regulatory flexibility analysis is required underthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This rule has been reviewed under Department of Agricultureprocedures required by Executive Order 12291 and Departmental Regulation1512-1 and has been classified as ``not major'' since the rule does nothave any of the effects specified in those documents.Presidential Proclamation No. 4941 of May 5, 1982 (47 FR 19661) establisheda country-by-country quota system for the importation of sugar into theUnited States. Under the import quota allocation provisions establishedunder the Proclamation, each country was allocated a specific percentageof the quota if that percentage was .7 percent or greater. A specifiedpercentage of the total quota amount was allocated to a group of countriesspecified in the Proclamation and designated as ``Other Specified Countriesand Areas'' (more commonly known as the ``basket category''). The percentageallocation of the quota to the basket category was pooled and each countrycompeted on a first-come-first-serve basis for the entire allocation.Proclamation No. 4941 further provided that notwithstanding the allocationprovisions set forth in the Proclamation, the Secretary may, after consultationwith the U.S. Trade Representative, the Department of State, and the Departmentof the Treasury, issue regulations modifying the allocation provisionsgoverning ``Other Specified Countries and Areas'' if the Secretary determinesthat such modifications are appropriate to provide such countries and areasreasonable access to the United States sugar market.These allocation provisions were modified in an interim rule publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on August 11, 1982 (47 FR 34769) to provide thateach country in the basket category would have a specific annual quota.Under that interim rule, each country received a quota allocation equalto its pro rata share of the quota allocation for the basket category,or 16,500 short tons, raw value, whichever was greater.The interim rule (47 FR 34769) was adopted as a final rule with a modificationand was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 6, 1985 (50 FR 49919). The finalrule modified the maximum level allocated to individual countries in thebasket category. Each country received a quota allocation equal to itspro rata share of the quota allocation for the basket category, or 12,500short tons, raw value, whichever is greater.The final rule (50 FR 49919) was further modified by an interim rule publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 18, 1986 (51 FR 45295) which reducedthe maximum quota allocated to each basket country to a level equal toits pro rata share of the percentage allocation for the basket category,or 7,500 short tons, raw value, whichever is greater. No comments werereceived with respect to the interim rule.The interim rule (51 FR 45295) was adopted as a final rule with a modificationand was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 18, 1987 (52 FR 48079). The finalrule modified the maximum level allocated to individual countries in thebasket category. Each country received a quota allocation equal to itspro rata share of the quota allocation for the basket category, or 5,770short tons, raw value, whichever is greater.This interim rule modifies the final rule (52 FR 48079) by revising thequota amount each basket country will receive to a level equal to its prorata share of the percentage allocation for the basket category, or 8,000short tons, raw value, whichever is greater. After consultation with the United States Trade Representative, the Departmentof State, and the Department of the Treasury, the Secretary of Agriculturehas determined that the modification of the allocation provisions coveringthe basket category is appropriate to provide countries or areas in thebasket category with reasonable access to the United States sugar market,in light of changed circumstances affecting such access. It has also beendetermined that these provisions are appropriate to carry out U.S. obligationsunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 6</ITAG>Agricultural commodities, Foreign trade, Imports, Quotas, Sugar.Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 6, Subpart_Sugar Import Quotas is modified as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 6_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
