The assessment providesa basis for the conclusion that the field testing of these geneticallyengineered Hansen poplar plants will not present a risk of introductionor dissemination of a plant pest and will not have any significant impacton the quality of the human environment.

A permit must be obtained before a regulated article can beintroduced in the United States. The regulations set forth procedures forobtaining a limited permit for the importation or interstate movement ofa regulated article and for obtaining a permit for the release into theenvironment of a regulated article. The Animal and Plant Health InspectionService (APHIS) has stated that it would prepare an environmental assessmentand, when necessary, an environmental impact statement before issuing apermit for the release into the environment of a regulated article (see52 FR 22906).Iowa State University, Ames, Iowa, has submitted an application for a permitfor release into the environment, to field test genetically engineeredHansen poplar plants to express a wound-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene which is a marker gene. The field trial will take placein Ames, Iowa.In the course of reviewing the permit application, APHIS assessed the impacton the environment of releasing the Hansen poplar plants under the conditionsdescribed in the Iowa State University application. APHIS concluded thatthe field testing will not present a risk of plant pest introduction ordissemination and will not have any significant impact on the quality ofthe human environment.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact, whichare based on data submitted by Iowa State University, as well as a reviewof other relevant literature, provide the public with documentation ofAPHIS' review and analysis of the environmental impacts associated withconducting the field testing.The facts supporting APHIS' finding of no significant impact are summarizedbelow and are contained in the environmental assessment.1. A gene encoding a wound-inducible chloramphenicol acetyl transferasehas been inserted into the poplar chromosome. In nature, the genetic materialcontained in a chromosome can only be transferred to another sexually compatibleplant by cross-pollination. In this field test trial, the inserted genecannot spread to any other sexually compatible plant by cross-pollinationbecause the trees will not be allowed to flower.2. Neither the proteinase inhibitor II promoter or terminator signal sequences,the chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene itself, nor the chloramphenicolacetyl transferase confer on poplar any plant pest characteristic.3. The potato plant, from which the proteinase inhibitor II promoter andterminator signal sequences were obtained, is not a plant pest.4. The wound-inducible chloramphenicol acetyl transferase gene does notprovide the genetically engineered poplar plants with any measurable selectiveadvantage over nongenetically engineered poplar in its ability to be disseminatedor to become established in the environment.5. Select noncoding regulatory regions derived from plant pests have beeninserted into the poplar chromosome. These sequences do not confer on poplarany plant pest characteristics.6. The vector used to transfer the wound-inducible chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene into a poplar chromosome has been evaluated for its usein this experiment. The vector agent, the bacterium that was used to deliverthe vector DNA and the wound-inducible chloramphenicol acetyl transferasegene into poplar cells, has been shown to be eliminated and no longer associatedwith transformed poplar.7. Horizontal movement of the introduced gene is not possible. The vectoracts by delivering the gene to the plant genome (i.e., chromosomal DNA).the vector does not survive in any plant.8. The size of the field test trial plot is small (30 meters by 15 meters).The plot will be located on a research farm which will provide adequatesecurity.The environmental assessment and finding of no significant impact havebeen prepared in accordance with: (1) The National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4331 <T3>et seq.</T3>), (2) Regulations of the Council on Environmental Qualityfor Implementing the Procedural Provisions of NEPA (40 CFR parts 1500-1509),(3) USDA Regulations Implementing NEPA (7 CFR part 1b), and (4) APHIS GuidelinesImplementing NEPA (44 FR 50381-50384, August 28, 1979, and 44 FR 51272-51274,August 31, 1979).<ITAG tagnum="21">Done in Washington, DC, this 19th day of September 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James W.
