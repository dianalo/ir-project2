McCLAIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Housing construction continued to rebound fromthe depressing effects of high mortgage rates with a 0.8 percentincrease in new starts last month, the government reported today.   This could mean more jobs in the construction and buildingmaterials industries, and additional employment and sales in suchhousing-related businesses as home furnishings and appliances.   The Commerce Department reported that new homes and apartmentswere built in July at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.43million units, up from 1.42 million units in June when the reboundbegan.   The housing industry had been among the sectors hardest hitearlier this year as the Federal Reserve drove interest rates up torestrain economic growth and contain inflation.   Construction starts had fallen for four consecutive monthsthrough May, the longest string of declines since activity slowedfor five months in a row from February through June 1987. The Maylevel of 1.31 million units was the slowest pace since the 1.3million rate in December 1982.   But the central bank began nudging rates down in June and, inanticipation of that move, fixed-rate mortgages began falling fromtheir peak of 11.22 percent in March. The Federal National MortgageAssociation said fixed rates had dropped to 9.96 percent by lastFriday.   The July construction pace followed a hefty 8.5 percent hike inJune, the highest since a 8.6 percent jump to 1.51 million units inFebruary 1988.   But June's increase reflected a 32.9 percent rise in the volatileapartment construction, the highest since a 43 percent increase inApril 1988. Apartment construction last month fell 1.2 percent to anannual rate of 389,000 units. It had increased 5.4 percent in Mayafter falling 26.6 percent in April.   Construction of single-family homes in July rose 6.3 percent toan annual rate of 1.04 million units. Single-family starts had risen0.2 percent in June after falling 5.1 percent in May and 4.7 percentin April.   Analysts had expected single-family construction to remain weakas the economy continued to slow, causing a buildup in unsold newhomes.   By region, overall housing construction jumped by 16 percent lastmonth in the Northeast, where starts rose to a seasonally adjustedannual rate of 196,000 units.   Starts were up 11 percent to 272,000 units in the Midwest butfell 4.3 percent to 530,000 units in the South and 4.2 percent to432,000 units in the West.   Applications for building permits, a barometer of futuremultifamily housing activity, were down 3.1 percent in July,following a drop of 2.9 percent in June. They had risen 1 percent inMay and 8.5 percent in April after three consecutive monthlydeclines.</TEXT></DOC>
