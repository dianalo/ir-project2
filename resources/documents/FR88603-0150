Effective Date </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26"> B. Paperwork Reduction Act </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background </ITAG>A. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve Drawdown Plan The Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) was established by the Energy Policyand Conservation Act of 1975 (EPCA, Pub. L. 94-163) to store up to onebillion barrels of petroleum to diminish the impact of disruptions on petroleumsupplies and to carry out obligations of the United States under the InternationalEnergy Program. The EPCA required the preparation of an ``SPR Plan'' detailingproposals for the development of the SPR; this SPR Plan was to includea Distribution Plan setting forth the methods for drawing down and distributingthe SPR in the event of an emergency. The mandated SPR Plan, which wassubmitted to Congress and subsequently took effect on April 18, 1977, indicatedthat the Distribution Plan was still being formulated. On October 21, 1979,a detailed Distribution Plan was transmitted to Congress as Amendment No.3 to the SPR Plan and became effective on November 15, 1979. This DistributionPlan set out a number of alternative distribution methods, ranging fromallocation to price competitive sales. In the Energy Emergency Preparedness Act of 1982 (EEPA), Pub. L. 97-229,Congress required that a new ``Drawdown'' (Distribution) Plan be transmittedto the Congress. The EEPA provided that this amendment to the SPR Planwould take effect on the date transmitted, without Congressional review.The new Distribution Plan, SPR Plan Amendment No. 4, was transmitted toCongress on December 1, 1982, and took effect on that date. The new Planprovided that the principal method of distributing SPR oil will be pricecompetitive sale. On March 16, 1983, DOE published a notice of proposed rulemaking (48 FR11125) to establish a framework for implementing the policies and proceduresset out in Amendment No. 4. For a discussion of the statutory authorityfor the SPR and the regulatory background of the proposed rule, <T3>see</T3> the preamble to the proposed rule at 48 FR 11125. B. The Final Rule The purpose of the SPR sales rule (48 FR 56541, December 21, 1983) is tofacilitate the sales process during a drawdown of the SPR by providingfor the establishment of Standard Sales Provisions (SSPs), containing contractterms and conditions developed in accordance with the rule which, it isexpected, will be contained in contracts for the sale of SPR petroleum.The rule calls for the publication of the SSPs in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and the Code of Federal Regulations as an appendixto the rule. The rule also provides for the periodic review and republicationof the SSPs in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>, including any revisions to such provisions.Upon a Presidential decision to draw down the SPR, DOE would issue a Noticeof Sale, announcing the amounts, types, and locations of the SPR petroleumto be sold, the delivery points, and other pertinent information. The ruleprovides that the Secretary of Energy or his designee would specify inthe Notice of Sale, by referencing the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and the Code of Federal Regulations in whichthe latest version of the SSPs was published, which of the terms and conditionsin the SSPs would or would not apply to a particular sale. In the Noticeof Sale, the Secretary also could revise such terms and conditions, oradd new ones which would apply to that particular sale. The rule providesthat no contract could be awarded to an offeror who had not unconditionallyagreed to all contractual provisions and responsibility measures made applicableby the Notice of Sale. The rule also provides a mechanism for excludingpurchasers that fail to perform their contractual obligations from futureparticipation in SPR sales. C. The Standard Sales Provisions <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Publication of the SSPs </ITAG>As provided in the SPR sales rule, draft SSPs were published on June 15,1983 (48 FR 27482) for public comment. The draft SSPs underwent significantrevision and were adopted as interim final procedures on January 20, 1984(49 FR 2692); additional public comment was sought on the interim finalSSPs. As the result of the public comments on the interim final SSPs, internalDOE exercises, the addition of the ARCO Terminal as a new distributionpoint for SPR petroleum, the National Petroleum Council (NPC) report tothe Secretary of Energy, <T3>The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, A Report on the Capability to DistributeSPR Oil </T3>(December 1984), and the SPR test sale held by DOE from November1985 to January 1986, on June 16, 1987 (52 FR 22960) DOE published draftrevisions to the interim final SSPs for public comment. DOE is now issuingthe revised SSPs for use in the event of a drawdown of the SPR. <ITAG tagnum="81">2. General Sales Objectives </ITAG>The procedures and provisions contained in the SSPs are designed to balanceand achieve two objectives of SPR Plan Amendment No. 4, i.e., to providethat SPR price competitive sales will be open to all interested buyers,but to establish measures to assure purchaser performance under the resultingcontracts. In order to maximize competition by the widest possible universe of offerors,DOE made the SSPs as unrestricted and nonjudgmental as possible. As requiredby Amendment No. 4, price is to be the determining factor in the awardof SPR petroleum sales contracts. The measures included in the SSPs to ensure the offeror's fulfillment ofits responsibilities include: <ITAG tagnum="15">a. Requirement for offer guarantee; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">b. Requirement for letter of credit or cash deposit to guarantee paymentand performance; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">c. Assessment of liquidated damages for failure to lift oil in accordancewith the contract; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">d. Possible termination for default. </ITAG>An offer or contract to acquire SPR oil thus would involve a substantialcommitment to the implementation of SPR drawdown and distribution in amanner consistent with the purposes of the SPR. For a more complete discussionof the responsibility measures, <T3>see </T3>the preamble to the interim final SSPs at 49 FR 2693-94. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. General Sales Procedures </ITAG>The SPR sales process starts with the issuance of a Notice of Sale whichwould indicate the amount, characteristics and location of the petroleumbeing sold, the delivery dates and the procedures for submitting offers,as well as providing other information pertinent to a particular sale;in addition, it would specify what contractual provisions and performanceand financial responsibility measures are applicable. Over the course of an SPR drawdown, a number of Notices of Sale may beissued, each covering a sales period of 1 to 2 months. Initially, Noticesof Sale issued during SPR drawdown could allow an extremely short leadtime for offers and deliveries. It is contemplated that offerors mightbe given as little as 7 days from the issuance of the Notice of Sale untiloffers are due, and as little as 30 days from the time of such issuanceuntil oil delivery starts, with a less compressed schedule becoming morefeasible after the initial stages of drawdown. Because of the possibleshort lead time, the SSPs provide for the establishment of a list of prospectiveofferors, to whom the Government would furnish copies of all Notices ofSale. The next step in the sales process is the preparation by prospective purchasersof their offers, which must be submitted before a time specified in theNotice of Sale. The SSPs require that the offeror: unconditionally acceptall terms and conditions made applicable to that sale by the Notice ofSale; include an offer guarantee; and offer at least the minimum price,if any, specified in the Notice of Sale. Following the receipt of offers, the Government would evaluate the offersto select the ``apparently successful'' offerors. The evaluation processis structured so that the highest offerors could select the method by whichthe SPR petroleum is to be transported, up to the limits of the SPR distributionsystems. Specific delivery arrangements are to be negotiated later. Under the SSPs, all apparently successful offerors would be required, withinas little as 5 days, to provide a letter of credit or a cash deposit asa guarantee of performance and of payment of amounts due under the contract.Upon timely receipt of the guarantee, and upon a final determination bythe Contracting Officer that the offer is responsive and the offeror responsible,the Government would issue the Notice of Acceptance. The only other bases in the SSPs upon which the Contracting Officer couldmake a finding of nonresponsibility, other than nonperforming purchasersthat had been excluded from SPR sales under the procedures establishedby the sales rule, are: (i) the offeror is on either DOE's or the FederalGovernment's list of debarred, ineligible, and suspended bidders; (ii)evidence of an offeror's conduct or activity which represents a violationof law or regulation, or Executive Order having the force and effect oflaw; or (iii) evidence which shows a lack of integrity (including actionsinimical to the welfare of the United States) or willingness to perform,and which would substantially diminish the Contracting Officer's confidencein the offeror's performance. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Major Comments </ITAG>A. Comments on the Draft Revised SSPs In response to the request for comments on the draft revisions to the SSPs,five sets of comments were received, four from refiners and one from anoil industry trade association. In general, all five commenters favoredthe revisions, stating that the revised provisions now conform more closelywith standard industry practices. However, the five did propose additionalchanges. The proposed revisions limited the circumstances in which a purchaser thatfailed to perform in accordance with the terms of the contract would beliable for liquidated damages. No. C.29 assesses liquidated damages ofone percent per day for each day of delay in taking delivery of SPR oilup to a maximum assessment of 30 percent. The proposed revisions wouldnot assess liquidated damages until three days after the end of the scheduledloading window and would excuse purchasers for nonperformance by transportationsubcontractors provided that the subcontractor is not an affiliate andthe services could not be obtained in a timely fashion from other sources.Three commenters objected that even with the changes, the liquidated damageswere an unreasonable burden on the purchaser. DOE disagrees. A purchaser'sfailure to honor an SPR petroleum sales contract could hinder attainmentof the desired drawdown rate, with possible adverse effects on the Nation.The liquidated damages are compensation for the damages incurred by thecountry when a buyer fails to comply with the contractually agreed deliveryschedule. Therefore, the revised SSPs continue to assess liquidated damagesfor unexcused delays in accepting delivery of the petroleum. One commentersuggested that the relief from liability for the failure of non-affiliatedtransportation subcontractors to perform be extended to apply to affiliatedsubcontractors. The relief was proposed because DOE had determined thatthe actions of non-affiliated transportation subcontractors are likelyto be beyond the control of the purchasers of SPR oil; such would not bethe case with affiliated transportation firms. Four commenters expressed concern relating to Jones Act waivers. Two commentersrecommended that, if no waiver is granted, an offeror should be allowedto withdraw his offer without penalty if it can be shown that the purchasermade a good faith effort to charter a coastwise-qualified vessel. Two commentersrecommended that the time period in which vessels could be initially nominatedor substitute vessels be named be extended to allow for a decision on aJones Act waiver request. The Notice of Sale will announce any generalwaiver of the Jones Act. The case-by-case Jones Act waiver procedures whichDOE has developed with the Maritime Administration and the U.S. CustomsService provide for a response to a waiver request in two days. Therefore,DOE believes that there will be sufficient time to obtain vessels to transportthe oil and that further exculpatory provisions are not required. Three commenters suggested that the proposed new provision on demurrageexcluded too many events from the calculation of laytime and demurrage.There is no standard industry practice with respect to how to calculatelaytime and time on demurrage. DOE, after review of several commercialcharter parties, believes that the Government's liability under these SSPsfalls within the range of commercial practice. Two commenters suggested that a system similar to that used to designatecategories of petroleum for ``Superfund'' tax purposes be used to designatepetroleum as belonging to various categories, e.g., Naval Petroleum Reservecrude oil or Alaskan North Slope crude oil, to assist in determining whichexport restrictions are applicable to crude oil delivered to a particularbuyer. Enforcement of the export control laws is the responsibility ofthe Department of Commerce, beyond the scope of these SSPs, and thereforeno such categorical designations will be made by DOE. One commenter suggested that, to conform more closely with commercial terms,DOE should be liable for the purchaser's cost in preparing to perform thecontract should the Government terminate the contract for its conveniencedue to a sovereign decision of the United States, such as a Presidentialdecision to terminate the drawdown. However, it is a long-established principleof Government contracting that the Government is not liable under its contractsfor its sovereign decisions impacting those contracts. One commenter suggested that notwithstanding the procedures for givingpreference to the scheduling requests of offerors with the highest pricedoffers, exceptions to that system should be allowed in unique situationswhen it is in the best interest of DOE, or the purchaser, such as a refinerythat is about to run out of petroleum. DOE agrees that scheduling flexibilityis desirable; SSP No. C.5(c), which allows purchasers to schedule deliveriesprior to the start of the contract delivery period on a first-come, firstserved basis unless unacceptable costs would be incurred or schedules disrupted,should accommodate most of these unique situations. One commenter was concerned that a purchaser would be required to acceptoil tendered for delivery regardless of characteristics, and which mightbe hazardous to load or transport. As the specifications in the Exhibitsto the SSPS make clear, the petroleum now in storage in the SPR containsno such hazards and DOE's purchase specifications and quality assuranceprocedures would preclude such crude oil from being acquired. As the petroleumis delivered directly to the purchaser without being commingled with othercrude oil streams, the delivery of unsuitable petroleum to a purchaseris improbable. One commenter suggested that the amount of time during which an offer mustremain valid should be reduced from 10 days to 3 days after the date offersare due. DOE disagrees. Offers must remain valid long enough for DOE toevaluate them, notify the apparently successful offerors, receive the paymentand performance guarantees (generally 5 days will be allowed to furnishthe guarantees) and to notify the next winning offeror if any apparentlysuccessful offeror defaults. Three days are insufficient to accomplishthese events. One commenter was concerned that the two business days deemed for receiptof a mailed notification from DOE are inadequate. DOE believes, however,that given the availability of overnight mail services and telex communication,two business days are adequate. The Contracting Officer may extend thatperiod in individual cases. Finally, one commenter suggested several clarifying definitions and citationsrelating to quantity and quality measurement standards, most of which havebeen incorporated into the text of provisions C.15 and C.16. B. Comments on SPR Plan Amendment No. 4 Three comments were received which suggested that sales be restricted toU.S. domestic refiners, their purchasing agents, and other traditionalsuppliers so that the sales procedures could be streamlined to acceptedcommercial terms. Section 161(c) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act explicitly providesthat drawdown and distribution must be in accordance with the SPR Planin effect at that time. Consequently, DOE cannot adopt any SSPs that areinconsistent with SPR Plan Amendment No. 4, which provides that ``all interestedbuyers will be eligible to bid for and purchase SPR oil ....'' <ITAG tagnum="84">III. The Revised Standard Sales Provisions </ITAG>No substantive changes have been made to the draft revised SSPs publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 16, 1987. For a discussion of the majorchanges to the interim final SSPs proposed by the draft revisions, <T3>see </T3>54 FR 22960. Several of the draft revised SSPs, however, have been slightly revisedto clarify meaning, correct citations, or give additional factual or proceduralinformation. There follows a provision-by-provision discussion of the noteworthyrevisions. <ITAG tagnum="81">SSP No. B.3 Requirements for vessels - caution to offerors </ITAG>This provision has been amended to make clear that all costs for the disposalof vessel sludge, oily bilge water wastes, and oily ballast will be theresponsibility of the vessel. <ITAG tagnum="81">SSP No. B.4 ``Superfund'' tax on SPR petroleum - caution to offers</ITAG>This provision has been revised to clarify that the 1.3 cents per barreltax to fund the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund was never enacted. The Noticeof Sale will advise purchasers of their ``Superfund'' tax liability. <ITAG tagnum="81">SSP No. B.23 Offeror's certification of acceptance period </ITAG>This provisions has been revised to clarify that only the prices for theapparently successful line items must remain valid for 30 days after receivinga notification of Apparently Successful Offeror. <ITAG tagnum="81">SSP No. C.5 Delivery and transportation scheduling </ITAG>1. The procedures for the scheduling of deliveries have been changed toprovide that all purchasers must propose a delivery schedule in writingno later than 15 days prior to the earliest delivery date offered in theNotice of Sale. In the event that conflicting requests are received, preferencewill be given to the highest priced offer. The SPR/PMO will respond tothe purchasers no later than 10 days prior to the start of deliveries eitherto confirm the schedule or propose an alternative schedule. The purchaserwill have two days to request reconsideration of any proposed alternativeschedule but DOE's decision on reconsideration is final. <ITAG tagnum="81">SSP No. C.8 Vessel loading procedures </ITAG>1. The minimum average loading rate requirement for vessels has been reducedfrom 20,000 to 15,000 barrels per hour. 2. A vessel's Notice of Readiness for loading shall be tendered upon arrivalat berth or at the customary anchorage (any anchorage from which the vesselcan reach the SPR dock within six hours). Customary anchorages for eachSPR terminal are listed in Exhibit E. 3. Allowable berth time for vessels with capacities larger than 500,000barrels is increased one hour for each 20,000 barrels to be loaded in excessof 500,000 barrels. <ITAG tagnum="81">SSP No. C.9 Vessel laytime and demurrage </ITAG>The citations to the tanker rate schedules to be used for calculating applicabledemurrage rates have been corrected and the applicable reference periodhas been identified for each. <ITAG tagnum="81">SSP No. C.15 Determination of quality of petroleum </ITAG>This provision now states that, for the samples from which crude oil qualityis determined, preference will be given to samples collected by means ofan inline sampler, when one is available and operational. <ITAG tagnum="81">Exhibit E </ITAG>1. Customary anchorages have been identified for each SPR terminal. 2. Phillips Terminal's permission to berth vessels less than 32,000 deadweighttons is no longer required. 3. The draft restriction at the DOE St. James Terminal has been increasedto 45 feet. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Procedural Matters </ITAG>A. Effective Date As of June 3, 1988 these SSPs are adopted for use in the price competitivesale of SPR petroleum. B. Paperwork Reduction Act The forms used in the sale of the SPR petroleum have been cleared by theOffice of Management and Budget in accordance with the Paperwork ReductionAct under control number 1910-1400. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 10 CFR Part 625 </ITAG>Administrative Practice and Procedure, Oil and Gas Reserves, Strategicand critical materials, Strategic Petroleum Reserve. <ITAG tagnum="6">Berton J.

Further, certain U.S.-flag vessels builtwith Construction Differential Subsidies (CDS) are precluded by Section506 of the Merchant Marine Act of of 1936 (46 U.S.C. 1156) from participatingin U.S. coastwise trade, unless such prohibition has been waived by theSecretary of Transportation, the waiver being limited to a maximum of 6months in any given year. CDS vessels may also receive Operating DifferentialSubsidies, requiring separate permission from the Secretary of Transportationfor domestic operation, under Section 805(a) of the same statute. The NSwill advise offerors of any general waivers allowing use of non-coastwisequalified vessels or vessels built with Construction Differential Subsidiesfor a particular sale of SPR petroleum. If there is no general waiver,purchasers may request waivers in accordance with Provision No. C.7, butremain obligated to complete performance under this contract regardlessof the outcome of that waiver process. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) The Department of Transportation's interim rule concerning ReceptionFacility Requirements for Waste Materials Retained on Board (33 CFR Parts151 and 158) implements the reception facility requirements of the InternationalConvention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modifiedby the 1978 Protocol relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78). This rule prohibitsany oceangoing tankship, required to retain oil or oily mixtures on-boardwhile at sea, from entering any port or terminal unless the port or terminalhas a valid Certificate of Adequacy as to its oily waste reception facilities.SPR marine terminals (<T3>see</T3> Exhibit E, SPR Delivery Point Data) have Certificates of Adequacyand reception facilities for vessel sludge and oily bilge water wastes,all costs for which will be borne by the vessel. The terminals, however,may not have reception facilities for oily ballast. Accordingly, tankshipswithout segregated ballast systems will be required to make arrangementsfor and be responsible for all costs associated with appropriate disposalof such ballast, or they will be denied permission to load SPR petroleumat terminals which lack reception facilities for oily ballast. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) By submission of this offer, the offeror certifies that it willcomply with the ``Jones Act'' and all applicable ballast disposal requirements.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.4 ``Superfund'' tax on SPR petroleum - caution to offerors </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Sections 4611 and 4612 of the Internal Revenue Code which imposeda tax on domestic and imported petroleum to support the Hazardous SubstanceResponse Fund (the ``Superfund'') have been revised by the Superfund Amendmentsand Reauthorization Act of 1986, Public Law No. 99-499, and the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1986, Public Law No. 99-509. As amended, thesesections impose taxes to finance the Hazardous Substance Superfund andthe Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund as of January 1, 1987 and February 1,1987, respectively. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Section 4611 imposes a tax of 8.2 cents a barrel for domesticcrude oil and 11.7 cents a barrel for foreign crude oil to support the``Superfund'' on (1) crude oil received at a United States refinery and(2) petroleum products (including crude oil) entered into the United Statesfor consumption, use or warehousing. In addition, Section 4611 providesfor a possible additional tax of 1.3 cents a barrel for both foreign anddomestic oil to support the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. Section 4612provides that no tax is imposed if it is established that a prior tax imposedby Section 4611 has already been paid with respect to a barrel of oil.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) DOE has already paid the ``Superfund'' taxes on some of the oilimported and stored in the SPR. However, no ``Superfund'' tax has beenpaid on imported oil stored prior to the effective dates of these Actsor domestic oil stored in the SPR, nor has tax been paid into the Oil SpillLiability Trust Fund for any oil. Because domestic and imported crude oilfor which no tax has been paid and imported crude oils for which ``Superfund''taxes have been paid at different rates have been commingled in the SPR,upon drawdown of the SPR, the NS will advise purchasers of the tax liability.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.5 Export limitations and licensing - caution to offerors </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Offerors for SPR petroleum are put on notice that SPR crude oilssubject to different export control laws have been commingled in storage.Export of SPR crude oil is subject to U.S. export control laws, the provisionsof which differ depending on the source and destination of the crude oilproposed to be exported. For example, imported crude oil stored in theSPR may be exported pursuant to applicable Department of Commerce ``ShortSupply Controls,'' 15 C.F.R. Part 377, if: the export is part of a transactionresulting in the importation of refined products of a quantity and qualitynot less than would be derived from domestic refining; the products areto be sold at prices no higher than the lowest prices at which they couldhave been sold by the nearest capable U.S. refinery; and for compellingeconomic or technological reasons beyond the exporter's control, the crudeoil cannot reasonably be processed in the U.S. (15 CFR 377.6(d)(1)(vii)).However, there are somewhat more stringent, independent statutory teststo be met as preconditions to the export of certain other crude oils storedin the SPR, including Alaskan North Slope (ANS) and Naval Petroleum Reserves(NPR) oil. <T3>See</T3> 7(d) of the Export Administration Act of 1979, 50 U.S.C App.2406(d) (ANS oil) and 10 U.S.C. 7430(e) (NPR oil); <T3>see also</T3> 30 U.S.C. 185(u) (oil shipped across a Mineral LandsLeasing Act Section 28(u) right-of-way) and 43 U.S.C. 1354(a) (OCS oil).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) By submission of this offer, the offeror certifies that it willcomply with any applicable U.S. export control laws. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.6 Issuance of the Notice of Sale </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In the event petroleum is sold from the SPR, DOE will issue a NS containingall of the pertinent information necessary for the offeror to prepare apriced offer. <T3>A NS may be issued with a week or less allowed for the receipt of offers.</T3>Offerors are expected to examine the complete NS document, and tobecome familiar with the SSPs cited therein.

Such acknowledgment mustbe received prior to the time specified for receipt of offers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.9 Late offers, modifications of offers, and withdrawal of offers</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Any offer received at the office designated in the NS after thetime specified for receipt will be considered only if it is received beforeaward is made and only under the following conditions: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) it was sent by registered or certified mail not later than thefifth calendar day prior to the date specified for the receipt of offers(e.g., an offer submitted in response to a NS requiring receipt of offersby the 20th of the month must have been mailed by the 15th or earlier);or, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) it was sent by mail, telegram or telex if authorized, and it isdetermined by the Contracting Officer that the late receipt was due solelyto mishandling by the SPR/PMO after receipt at the address specified inthe NS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Any modification or withdrawal of an offer is subject to the sameconditions as in (a) above, except that it shall be mailed not less thanthe third calendar day prior to the date specified for receipt of offers.An offer may also be withdrawn in person by an offeror or its authorizedrepresentative, provided the representative's identity is made known andthe representative signs a receipt for the offer, but only if the withdrawalis made prior to the time set for receipt of offers. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The only acceptable evidence to establish: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) the date of mailing of a late offer, modification, or withdrawalsent either by registered or certified mail is the U.S. Postal Servicepostmark on either (i) the envelope or wrapper, or (ii) the original receiptfrom the U.S. Postal Service. If neither postmark shows a legible date,the offer, modification or withdrawal shall be deemed to have been mailedlate. Post mark means a printed, stamped, or otherwise placed impression,exclusive of a postage meter machine impression, that is readily identifiablewithout further action as having been supplied and affixed on the dateof mailing by employees of the U.S. Postal Service. Therefore, offerorsshould request the postal clerk to place a hand cancellation ``bull's-eye''postmark on both the receipt and the envelope or wrapper. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) the time of receipt at the address specified in the NS is thetime/date stamp at such address on the offer's wrapper or other documentaryevidence of receipt maintained at the place of receipt. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) Notwithstanding (a) and (b) of this provision, a late modificationof an otherwise successful offer which makes its terms more favorable tothe Government will be considered at any time it is received, and may beaccepted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.10 Offer guarantee </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Each offeror must submit an acceptable offer guarantee for eachoffer submitted.

Currently, there are eight MLIs inExhibit A, one for each of the eight crude oil streams that the SPR hasin storage. The NS may offer fewer than the eight possible MLIs. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) Each MLI contains several DLIs, each of which specifies an availabledelivery method and the nominal delivery period. Offerors are cautionedthat the NS may alter the period of time covered by each DLI. This is mostlikely to occur in the first sales period of a drawdown if the period ofsale does not correspond to a calendar month. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) DLI-A covers petroleum to be transported by pipeline, either commoncarrier or local. The nominal delivery period is one month. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) DLI-B, DLI-C and DLI-D cover petroleum to be transported by tankships:DLI-B, covering tankships to be loaded from the 1st through the 10th ofthe month; DLI-C, tankships to be loaded from the 11th through the 20th;and DLI-D, tankships to be loaded from the 21st through the last day ofthe month. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) DLI-E, DLI-F and DLI-G cover petroleum to be transported by barges(Caution: These DLIs are currently only applicable to deliveries of WestHackberry Sweet and Sour crude oil streams from Sun Docks): DLI-E, coveringbarges to be loaded from the 1st through the 10th of the month; DLI-F,barges to be loaded from the 11th through the 20th; and DLI-G, barges tobe loaded from the 21st through the last day of the month. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Where the storage site is connected to more than one terminalor pipeline (presently this only occurs at Bryan Mound) additional DLIswill be offered. The additional DLIs will include DLI-H, covering petroleumto be transported by pipeline over the period of a month; DLI-I, coveringtankships to be loaded from the 1st through the 10th; DLI-J, tankshipsto be loaded from the 11th through the 20th; and DLI-K, tankships to beloaded from the 21st through the last day of the month. The Notice of Salewill specify which DLIs are offered on each MLI. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The NS will state the total estimated number of barrels to besold on each MLI. An offeror may offer to buy all or part of the petroleumoffered on an MLI. In making awards, the Contracting Officer shall attemptto achieve award of the exact quantities offered by the NS, but may varythe estimated MLI quantities by +/^10 percent in order to match the DLIoffers received. In addition, the Contracting Officer may reduce the MLIquantity available for award by any amount and reject otherwise acceptableoffers, if he determines, in his sole discretion after consideration ofthe offers received on all of the MLIs, that award of those quantitiesis not in the best interest of the Government because the prices offeredfor them are not reasonable. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The NS will specify a minimum contract quantity for each DLI.To be responsive, an offer on a DLI must be for at least that quantity.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(e) The NS will specify the maximum quantity which could be sold oneach of the DLIs. The maximum quantity is not an indication of the amountof petroleum that, in fact, will be sold on that DLI. Rather, it representsDOE's best estimate of the maximum amount of the particular SPR crude oilstream that can be moved by that transportation system over the deliveryperiod. The total DOE estimated DLI maximums may exceed the total numberof barrels to be sold on that MLI, as the NS DLI estimates represent estimatedtransportation capacity, not the amount of petroleum offered for sale.Where necessary to avoid an unfair competitive advantage for local pipelineowners, e.g., where there are only one or two likely offerors, the NS mayomit a pipeline DLI. Where this occurs, those offerors may bid againstvessel DLIs and, if successful, request a contract modification under ProvisionNo. C.6, to permit delivery of the awarded oil to a pipeline. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(f) The NS will not specify what portion of the petroleum which DOEoffers on a MLI will, in fact, be sold on any given DLI. Rather, the highestpriced offers received on the MLI will determine the DLIs against whichthe offered petroleum is sold. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(g) DOE will not sell petroleum on a DLI in excess of the DLI maximum;however, DOE reserves the right to revise its estimates at any time andto award or modify contracts in accordance with its revised estimates.Offerors are cautioned that: DOE cannot guarantee that such transportationcapacity is available; offerors should undertake their own analyses ofavailable transportation capacity; and each purchaser is wholly responsiblefor arranging all transportation other than terminal arrangements at theterminals listed in Provision No. B.15, which shall be made in accordancewith Provision No. C.5. A purchaser against one DLI cannot change a transportationmode without prior written permission from DOE, although such permissionwill be given whenever possible, in accordance with Provision No. C.6.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(h) Exhibit D, SPR Crude Oil Stream Characteristics, contains nominalcharacteristics for each SPR crude oil stream. Prospective offerors arecautioned that these data will likely change as more crude oil is storedin the SPR. The NS will provide, to the maximum extent practicable, thelatest data on each stream offered. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.17 Line item information to be provided in the offer </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Each offeror, if determined to be an ASO on a DLI, agrees to enterinto a contract for the purchase of the quantity of petroleum in the offerand to take delivery of that petroleum (plus or minus 10 percent as providedfor in Provision No. C.18) in accordance with the terms of that contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) An offer may be for more than one MLI. However, offerors are cautionedthat alternate offers on different MLIs are not permitted. For example,an offeror may offer to purchase 1,000,000 barrels of SPR West HackberrySweet and 1,000,000 barrels of SPR West Hackberry Sour, but may not offerto purchase, in the alternative, either 1,000,000 barrels of sweet or 1,000,000barrels of sour. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) An offeror may submit more than one offer. However, separate formsmust be prepared and each offer will be evaluated on an individual basis.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) The following information will be provided to DOE by the offeroron the form in Exhibit A or other forms as required by the NS: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) MLI quantity. (``MAXQ'' on the Exhibit A offer form) The offerorshall state the maximum quantity of each crude oil stream that the offeroris willing to buy. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) DLI quantity. (``DESQ'') The offer shall state the number of barrelswhich the offeror will accept on each DLI, i.e., by the delivery mode andduring the delivery period specified. The quantity stated on a single DLIshall not exceed the MAXQ for the MLI. The offeror shall designate a quantityon at least one DLI for the MLI, but may designate quantities on more thanone DLI. If the offeror is willing to accept alternate DLIs, the totalof its designated DLI quantities would exceed its maximum MLI quantity;otherwise, the total of its designated DLI quantities should equal itsmaximum MLI quantity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) DLI unit price (``UP$$'') and total price. The offer shall statethe price per barrel for each DLI for which the offeror has designateda desired quantity, as well as the total price (quantity times unit price).Where offers have indicated quantities on more than one DLI with a differentprice on each, DOE will award the highest priced DLI first. If the offerorhas the same price for two or more DLIs, it may indicate its first choice,second choice, etc., for award of those items; if the offeror does notindicate a preference, or indicates the same preference for more than oneDLI, DOE may select the DLIs to be awarded at its discretion. Prices maybe stated in hundredths of a cent ($0.0001). DOE shall drop from the offerand not consider any numbers of less than one one-hundredth of a cent.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) Minimum DLI quantity acceptable. (``MINQ'') The offeror must choosewhether to accept only the stated DLI quantity (DESQ) or, in the alternative,to accept any quantity awarded between the offer's stated DLI quantityand the minimum contract quantity for the DLI (indicated by the ``N'' and``Y'' blocks respectively under ``MINQ'' on the offer form). However, DOEwill award less than the DESQ only if the quantity available to be awardedis less than the DESQ. If the offer fails to indicate the offeror's choice,the offer will be evaluated as though the offeror has indicated willingnessto accept the minimum contract quantity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) Any other data required by the NS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.18 Mistake in offer </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) After opening and recording offers, the Contracting Officer shallexamine all offers for mistakes. If the Contracting Officer discovers anyprice discrepancies or quantity discrepancies, he may obtain from the offerororal or written verification of the offer actually intended, but in anyevent, he shall proceed with offer evaluation applying the following procedures:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Price discrepancy: An offer for a DLI should contain the unitprice per barrel being offered, the desired quantity of barrels to whichthe unit price applies, and an extension price which is the total of thequantity desired multiplied by the unit price offered. If there is a discrepancybetween the unit price and the extension price, the unit price will governand be recorded as the offer, unless it is clearly apparent on the faceof the offer that there has been a clerical error, in which case the ContractingOfficer may correct the offer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Quantity discrepancy: In case of conflict between the maximumMLI quantity and the stated DLI quantities (for example, where a singlestated DLI quantity exceeds the corresponding maximum MLI quantity), thelesser quantity will govern in the evaluation of the offer. In the eventthat the offer fails to specify a maximum MLI quantity, the offer willbe evaluated as though the largest stated DLI quantity was the offer'smaximum MLI quantity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) In cases where the Contracting Officer has reason to believe amistake not covered by the procedures set forth in (a) may have been made,he shall request from the offeror a verification of the offer, callingattention to the suspected mistake. The Contracting Officer may telephonethe offeror and confirm the request by telex. The Contracting Officer mayset a limit of as little as 6 hours for telephone response, with any requiredwritten documentation to be received within as little as 2 business days.If no response is received, the Contracting Officer may determine thatno error exists and proceed with offer evaluation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) The Head of the Contracting Activity will make administrativedeterminations described in (1) and (2) below if an offeror alleges a mistakeafter opening of offers and before award. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) The Head of the Contracting Activity may refuse to permit theofferor to withdraw an offer, but permit correction of the offer if clearand convincing evidence establishes both the existence of a mistake andthe offer actually intended. However, if such correction would result indisplacing one or more higher acceptable offers, the Head of the ContractingActivity shall not so determine unless the existence of the mistake andthe offer actually intended are ascertainable substantially from the NSand offer itself. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) The Head of the Contracting Activity may determine that an offerorshall be permitted to withdraw an offer in whole, or in part if only partof the offer is affected, without penalty under the offer guarantee, wherethe offeror requests permission to do so and clear and convincing evidenceestablishes the existence of a mistake, but not the offer actually intended.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(d) In all cases where the offeror is allowed to make verbal correctionsto the original offer, confirmation of these corrections must be receivedin writing within the time set by the Contracting Officer or the originaloffer will stand as submitted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.19 Evaluation of offers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) The Contracting Officer will be the determining official as towhether an offer is responsive to the SSPs and the NS. DOE reserves theright to reject any or all offers and to waive minor informalities or irregularitiesin offers received. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) A minor informality or irregularity in an offer is an inconsequentialdefect the waiver or correction of which would not be prejudicial to otherofferors. Such a defect or variation from the strict requirements of theNS is inconsequential when its significance as to price, quantity, qualityor delivery is negligible. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.20 Procedures for evaluation of offers </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) Award on each DLI will be made to the highest responsible offerorswhich submit offers responsive to the SSPs and the NS and which have providedthe required payment and performance guarantee as required by ProvisionNo. C.19. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) DOE will array all price offers on an MLI from highest to lowestfor award evaluation regardless of DLI. However, DOE will award againstthe DLIs and will not award a greater quantity on a DLI than DOE's estimate(which is subject to change at any time) of the maximum quantity that canbe moved by the delivery method. Selection of the apparently successfuloffer involves the following steps: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Any offers below the minimum acceptable price, if any minimumprice has been established for the sale, will be rejected as nonresponsive.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) All offers on each MLI will be arrayed from highest price to lowestprice. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) The highest offers will be reviewed for responsiveness to theNS. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(4) In the event the highest offer does not take all the crude oilavailable on the MLI, sequentially, the next highest offer will be selecteduntil all of the petroleum offered on the MLI is awarded or there are nomore acceptable offers. In the event that acceptance of an offer againstan MLI or a DLI would result in the sale of more petroleum on an MLI thanDOE has offered or the sale of more petroleum on a DLI than DOE estimatescan be delivered by the specified delivery method, DOE will not award thefull amount of the offer, but rather the remaining MLI quantity or DLIcapacity, provided such portion exceeds DOE's minimum contract quantity.In the event that the quantity remaining is less than the offeror is willingto accept, but more than DOE's minimum contract quantity, the ContractingOfficer shall proceed to the next highest offer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(5) In the event of tied offers and an insufficient quantity availableon the MLI or insufficient capacity on the DLI to fully award all tiedoffers, the available MLI quantity or DLI capacity remaining will be allottedpro rata among the tied offers using the following formula: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L1(0,0,0),b1,tp0,p8,8/1,g1,t1,s8,r80,1,r40,r8</C> <H1> </H1><H1>The quantity the offeror is willing to purchase at the tied price </H1><H2>The sum of all the quantities the tied offerors are willing to purchaseat the tied price </H2><H1>andmultiply; </H1><H1>the quantity or capacity remaining to be allotted </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="22"> </ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">If after application of this formula, the pro rata share of any offeroris less than 90 percent of the quantity which the offeror is willing toaccept (as indicated in the offer), the Contracting Officer in his solediscretion may do one or more of the following: (i) make additional quantityor capacity available and increase the offeror's share to its minimum acceptablequantity; (ii) contact the offeror to determine whether alternative deliveryarrangements can be made, permitting the offeror to accept his proratashare; (iii) eliminate the offeror and recalculate the shares of all remainingofferors; or (iv) not award that offeror's prorata share. If any quantitiesremain after this process, the Contracting Officer may elect not to awardthose quantities, or to award those quantities in accordance with ProvisionNo. B.22. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(6) The Contracting Officer may reduce the MLI quantity availablefor award by any amount and reject otherwise acceptable offers, if in hissole discretion he determines, after consideration of the offers receivedon all of the MLIs, that award of those quantities is not in the best interestof the Government because the prices offered for them are not reasonable.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(7) Determinations of ASO responsibility will be made by the ContractingOfficer before each award. All ASOs will be notified by telephone and advisedto provide to the Contracting Officer, within five business days or suchother longer time as the Contracting Officer shall determine, a letterof credit (<T3>see</T3> Exhibit H, Payment and Performance Guarantee - Letter of Credit)or advance payment as specified in Provision No. C.19. Compliance withrequired payment and performance guarantees will effectively assure a findingof responsibility of offerors, except where: (i) an offeror is on eitherDOE's or the Federal Government's list of debarred, ineligible and suspendedbidders; or (ii) evidence, with respect to an offeror, comes to the attentionof the Contracting Officer of conduct or activity which represents a violationof law or regulation (including an Executive Order having the force andeffect of law); or (iii) evidence is brought to the attention of the ContractingOfficer of past activity or conduct of an offeror which shows a lack ofintegrity (including actions inimical to the welfare of the United States)or willingness to perform, so as to substantially diminish the ContractingOfficer's confidence in the offeror's performance under the proposed contract.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.21 Financial statements and other information </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) As indicated in Provision No. B.20(b)(7) above, compliance withthe required payment and performance guarantee will in most instances effectivelyassure a finding of responsibility. Therefore, DOE does not intend to askfor financial information from all offerors. However, after receipt ofoffers, but prior to making award, DOE reserves the right to ask for theaudited financial statements for an offeror's most recent fiscal year andunaudited financial statements for any subsequent quarters. These financialstatements must include a balance sheet and profit and loss statement foreach period covered thereby. A certification by a principal accountingofficer that there have been no material changes in financial conditionsince the date of the audited statements, and that these present the truefinancial condition as of the date of the offer, shall accompany the statements.If there has been a change, the amount and nature of the change must bespecified and explained in the unaudited statements and a principal accountingofficer shall certify that they are accurate. The Contracting Officer shallset a deadline for receipt of this information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) DOE also reserves the right to require information from the offerorregarding its plans for use of the petroleum, the status of requests forexport licenses, plans for complying with the Jones Act, etc. The ContractingOfficer shall set a deadline for receipt of this information. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">B.22 Resolicitation procedures on unsold petroleum </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(a) In the event that petroleum offered on an MLI remains unsold afterevaluation of all offers, the Contracting Officer, at his option, may issuean amendment to the NS, resoliciting offers from all interested parties.DOE reserves the right to alter the MLIs and/or offer different MLIs inthe resolicitation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) In the event that for any reason petroleum which has been awardedor allotted for award becomes available to DOE for resale, the ContractingOfficer may use the following procedures: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) If priced offers remain valid in accordance with Provision No.B.23, the petroleum will go to the next highest ranked offer. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) If offers have expired in accordance with Provision No. B.23,the Contracting Officer at his option may offer the petroleum to the highestofferor for that MLI.
