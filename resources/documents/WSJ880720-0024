Mitchell (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><TEXT>   As the stock market goes, so goes the rush to get an M.B.A.    In both 1986 and 1987, the number of people applying to the nation's graduate business schools rose at unprecedented rates -- 30% to 40%. But this year, on the heels of last October's market crash, many schools showed no increases in applications. And at some they even declined.    &quot;For a while, (an M.B.A.) was the golden key and the ticket to everything,&quot; says Andrea Hershatter, director of admissions for Emory University's business school, which received about the same number of applications this year as it did last, when it received 37% more than the year before. But students are &quot;being much more realistic now. . . . We've had to do hit after hit after hit to get the quality (of student) we want.&quot;    Faced with that kind of resistance, almost every business school in the U.S. is out beating the bushes for applicants. They are bombarding inquirers with increasing numbers of personalized mailings and fancy brochures. They are stepping up the courting of minorities and women. And they are extending their recruiting drives overseas. Indeed, schools that once felt no need to sell prospective students with personal interviews are now talking to all comers.    Certainly, the October 1987 stock market crash is a major reason for this turn of events: With thousands of high-priced, M.B.A.-toting Wall Streeters now out of work, the advanced business degree no longer seems a sure road to riches.    But there are other factors, too. New federal laws have slashed the number of people able to qualify for federally subsidized student loans and cut back the amount of money available to those who do. Furthermore, changes in tax laws have reduced the amount of money companies can deduct for subsidizing employees' educations, leading a number of companies to scale back on such programs.    In this new environment, it's often no longer just a matter of admissions officials selling the merits of one school over the next. Instead, recruiters say they now are having to convince prospects of the value of the M.B.A. itself. &quot;We (are) a bit on the defensive with Black Monday and all,&quot; says Stephen Christakos, director of admissions at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business, where the number of applications for the fall semester was up only 2% over the previous year, following last year's 35% increase over the year before that. &quot;There's more and more people saying, 'Maybe I ought to stay put for a while.'&quot;    Indeed, Greg Case, 25, said just that after being accepted by both Wharton and the University of California, Los Angeles. He currently works for Investments Orange Nassau, a Newport Beach, Calif., venture capital company. In the wake of the October market crash, he has come to believe that an M.B.A. won't make or break his career. &quot;It's no longer an absolute, rubber-stamp kind of decision,&quot; he says. &quot;It's just not clear any more that the cost makes sense for the benefits you get.&quot;    Such skepticism may eventually lead to a shakeout in the business school industry. In 1974, there were 369 graduate business schools. Now there are 700. And some of them are likely to falter as demand for their degrees slacken and competition for students increases, says Charles Hickman, director of projects and M.B.A. services for the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business, an association of business school deans. His assessment: &quot;If (business schools) are going to survive, they're going to have to be more distinctive than they've been.&quot;    Some schools have already gotten the message. This spring, Southern Methodist University's Edwin L. Cox School of Business noted an alarming 25% decline in applications from a year earlier. In response, it launched a $5,000 ad campaign, promoting itself in local newspapers and in numerous college publications. It also decided to go back and recruit at regional undergraduate schools it had visited just last fall. The tactics worked: The applicant pool this year ended up being about the same size as last year's.    Even Wharton, one of the nation's most prestigious business schools, has stepped up its recruiting efforts. In the past, Wharton rarely used in-person interviews to do more than size up prospective students who weren't clearly qualified for admission. And even then it kept the number low: two years ago it saw only 11% of its applicants. But this year, the school interviewed all the candidates it could -- 41% of the entire number -- and also used the time to pitch the advantages of a Wharton education.    Furthermore, every person who inquired about Wharton's program for the 1988-89 school year -- 33,000 people in all -- received a slick brochure touting the accomplishments of its more prominent graduates, among them New York developer Donald Trump, financier Saul Steinberg and John Sculley, president of Apple Computer Inc. Previously, the mailing went just to matriculating students.    Admissions officials also are tapping foreign markets, where the impact of the falling dollar on tuition costs has people clamoring for bargain-priced American M.B.A.s. Stanford University's business school, for example, recently sent a team of officials to several Scandinavian countries in its search for students.    Like many other schools, Stanford also is beefing up its efforts to attract women and minorities. Last November, it hosted a special reception for women; 66 showed up, and half of them applied for the coming fall semester.    In its drive for more minority students, Stanford joined forces with UCLA, the University of California at Berkeley and the University of Southern California to sponsor a forum targeting blacks and Hispanics; about 200 prospective students attended the event.    This year, even those students who already have forked over their deposits aren't considered bagged game. &quot;When they get ready to march off their jobs, will they really leave to go to graduate school?&quot; frets Joel Covington, admissions director at Vanderbilt University's Owen Graduate School of Management. To help ensure that they will, Owen this year increased the money available for grants and scholarships by 10%, to about $1 million. The school figures the promise of money might ease prospects' financial worries arising from the changes in regulations governing federally subsidized student loans. It also may give the school an edge in snagging top students away from other programs.    As the competition for students heats up, some schools are turning to the computer for a bit of high-tech help. Indiana University's business school is installing an $80,000 software program designed to keep track of a student's performance both in school and after graduating. It then comes up with a profile of the kind of student most likely to succeed. By bringing in more students that fit the profile, the school believes it can churn out larger numbers of successful graduates -- and then use that fact to promote itself. Ultimately, says Joseph Pica, the school's director of admissions, &quot;you increase the chances that you'll bring in even more (students) on the front end&quot; than the school does now.    ---               Who Wants a Business Degree?
