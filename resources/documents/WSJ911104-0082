As part of a broad Federal Aviation Administration effortto improve security, several companies are developingcomputer-based systems that can find all sorts of explosivesthat would currently go undetected.   For instance, Scan-Tech Security, Northvale, N.J., isworking with researchers at Rutgers University to useelectromagnetism to probe the contents of a piece of luggage.The system would then take the feedback and evaluate it usingan esoteric type of computer called a neural network.   Such systems are designed much the way the human brain is.They include numerous processors whose degree of influence oneach other can be changed. That flexibility means a neuralnetwork can be trained through practice. If it produces thewrong answer -- letting a bomb slip through in a dry run --the system will alter its own logic. The process can, intheory, be repeated until the system is nearly flawless.   Currently, even the most advanced devices being tested bythe FAA just examine bags for concentrations of nitrogen,often a telltale sign of a bomb. But that doesn't find allbombs, and lots of other things, such as some clothing,contain nitrogen, so there can be many false alarms.Scan-Tech says its system should be much more precise,because it can look for the specific molecule that identifieseach type of explosive.   Imatron Industrial Products, San Francisco, uses atechnology similar to that used by doctors in CAT scans tolook inside the human body. The system produces a detailedimage of what's inside a bag. It also evaluates an X-rayimage to look for the specific patterns caused by knownexplosives, to alert an operator that there may be a bomb.   The FAA says any new system would be used at least toinspect luggage being checked onto planes, and if it workedwell enough, might also be incorporated into systems usedwith carry-on bags.                                                                                                          Building Prototypes   Right at Your Desk                                                                                                          FOR a few years now, researchers have been making progressin a field that is coming to be known as desktopmanufacturing.   The systems let designers produce prototypes of partsright at their desks, instead of having to dispatchspecifications to a shop. As a result, the prototypes ofturbine blades and auto engine parts can take minutes orhours to produce, instead of days or weeks.   One of the problems has been that the systems have onlybeen able to build prototypes out of plastic or metal powder,so the parts have been flimsy. That has made it hard to testthem in real-life situations.   Now, researchers at Carnegie Mellon University inPittsburgh say they have developed a method using masks thatwill let parts be built out of dense metals that should standup to a pounding. It also will allow for parts made out ofvarious materials.   Once a part is designed on a computer, the Carnegie Mellonsystem reads it and uses a laser to cut holes in a series ofmasks. Various materials can be sprayed by a special nozzlethrough the holes in the first mask, forming a layer that's1/200th of an inch thick. As succeeding masks areautomatically placed over what's already there, the prototypegrows into its final shape.                                                                                                          Calling Up a Machine   To Manufacture a Part                                                                                                          ROBERT White, undersecretary for technology at theDepartment of Commerce, says that when certain parts wereunexpectedly needed by the U.S. military for the war in thePersian Gulf, they were milled in the U.S. and shipped to thewar zone within 48 hours. He says that's far faster thanwould have been possible in past wars. The reason for theimprovement: a newly popular type of electronic communicationknown as CALS.   CALS, which stands for computer-aided acquisition andlogistics support, is akin to the sorts of communication thatlet businesses send orders electronically, and that let bankstransfer funds that way. But the process is more complicatedwith CALS, because the designs for parts being transmittedare so elaborate. Thus, CALS has been slower to take hold.   Now that it's catching on at lots of companies, someonewanting a part can send the specifications over a phone linedirectly to the machine that will do the milling at asupplier's facility. The Commerce Department says that shouldhelp companies reduce inventories even more than they alreadyhave. Because CALS creates a sort of language forcommunicating about design, it also lets engineers share datafaster. That reduces design changes by 50%, the departmentsays, and speeds product development.   One drawback is that CALS has mainly taken hold among bigcompanies, and not among the small companies that are theirsuppliers. Mr. White estimates that only 20% of small U.S.companies have the automated machine tools and othertechnology necessary to use CALS.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          FOR HIKERS really worried about getting lost, Sonyintroduces a 1 1/2-pound handheld device that can use thesatellites in the Global Positioning System to tell the userprecisely where he is at any moment.
