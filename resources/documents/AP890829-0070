(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   PTL founder Jim Bakker complained justweeks before he resigned in 1987 that he didn't live as well asother evangelists, a former aide testified today at Bakker's fraudand conspiracy trial.   ``We were at ORU (Oral Roberts University) and they were showingus around,'' David Taggart said. ``Mr. Bakker said that he livedshabbily compared to Oral Roberts ... and other ministers.''   Taggart, who was convicted last month of tax evasion, said Bakkermade the comment while they were in Oral Roberts' office in Tulsa,Okla. The office, he said, ``is about the size of thos courtroom.''   He also testified that Bakker had become fascinated with realestate investments and had said he wanted to invest his bonuspayments from PTL in land. ``He told me he wanted to have 10homes,'' Taggart said.   Taggart also said the Bakker's parsonage electric bill usuallyran about $1,800 to $2,000 a month because ``the pool was kept at avery high temperature ... in the 90s.''   Taggart began his testimony on Monday, the first day of Bakker'sfederal court trial. He testified then that the PTL ministry founderused church money to pay Jessica Hahn to keep silent about theirtryst.   Taggart said his former boss also used official funds to buyhomes, expensive cars and to finance luxurious trips to seasideresorts.   A prosecutor, citing what he called excesses in Bakker'slifestyle, said on one occasion the minister and his wife bought$100 worth of cinnamon buns from a bakery because they liked thearoma, and threw the rolls out from their hotel suite three dayslater without eating a single one.   Bakker is charged with 28 counts of fraud and conspiracy andcould be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $5 million iffound guilty of all of them.   Bakker quit PTL in March 1987 amid revelations about his 1980sexual encounter with church secretary Hahn and a $265,000 payoff toher. Bakker attorney George T. Davis said the Hahn payment was madewithout Bakker's knowledge.   Taggart said Bakker complained about his salary and told him topPTL executives diverted funds for their own use.   ``I remember Mr. Bakker saying he wanted to be paid like JohnnyCarson,'' Taggart testified. ``He said some fund-raisers got up to10 percent of what they took in.''   Prosecutors say Bakker and other executives at the evangelicalempire diverted for their own benefit at least $4 million of the$158 million they raised by selling ``lifetime partnerships'' at theministry's resort hotels.   Davis said his client is innocent and called him a ``creativereligious genius.''   Bakker didn't ``sell'' anything, Davis said. ``What happened wasgifts or donations. This was a church.''   Davis blamed problems at PTL on trusted lieutenants and notedthat former PTL vice president Richard Dortch as well as Taggart andhis brother, James, are convicted felons.   Dortch pleaded guilty to fraud and conspiracy charges in exchangefor testimony against Bakker. He was sentenced last week to eightyears in prison and fined $200,000.   David and James Taggart were convicted last month of tax evasionon money received from the PTL. Each faces 25 years in prison and $1million in fines at sentencing Sept. 8.   David Taggart testified that one 1986 document in Bakker'shandwriting suggested in 1986 cutting the ministry's payroll to $10million from $24 million. Taggart said that same month the PTL boardvoted Bakker a $200,000 bonus and a $100,000 bonus for his wife,Tammy Faye.   Under Bakker's orders, Taggart said he spent more than $500,000in PTL money to purchase and decorate a condominium for the Bakkerfamily in Highland Beach, Fla., in 1982.   Taggart said Bakker also purchased a $600,000 home in PalmSprings, Calif., a month before he resigned.   Bakker had little to say after the day's proceedings.   ``I'm tired,'' he told reporters.   Meanwhile, Tammy Faye Bakker carried on with the couple'stelevision program broadcast from Orlando, Fla., asking viewers topray for her husband. She said she wanted to have the ``Jim andTammy Show'' on the air so ``Jim will have something to come hometo.''   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller said the ``case is aboutcheating people out of their money, tricking people out of theirmoney by the use of the mails, telephone and television.''   The money paid for ``a lavish lifestyle most of you won't be ableto identify with,'' Miller said, including $100,000 for a privatejet to take the Bakkers' clothing to California. Miller said theBakkers had two Rolls Royces and four Mercedes cars, including oneused only to drive Bakker's 12-year-old son from place to place.   Miller said the Bakkers bought the cinnamon buns during a trip,and tossed them out three days later, ``with not a bite taken out ofany of them.''</TEXT></DOC>
