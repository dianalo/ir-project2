Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt, Syria's main Lebanese ally, ordereda general mobilization in his 200,000-member Druse community toprepare for a major battle against the Christians, Moslem sourcessaid.   Police said two people were killed and nine wounded in clashesbetween Syrian troops and Christian forces along Beirut'sChristian-Moslem dividing line and three other fronts in the centralLebanese mountains and in north Lebanon.   The new casualties raised the overall toll to 781 killed and2,118 wounded since fighting broke out March 8 between Gen. MichelAoun's mainly Christian army units and Syrian troops backed byJumblatt's Progressive Socialist Party.   Spradic exchanges have broken a general lull prevailing since theU.N. Security Council appealed Tuesday for a cease-fire.   In its statement published by Beirut newspapers, Hezbollah, orParty of God, accused France, Washington and the pope of favoringLebanese Christians in the 14-year-old civil war with Moslems.   ``The French naval buildup in the Mediterranean, the Pope'sfanatic and biased stands, and America's moves at the (U.N.)Security Council are part of the arrogant campaign aimed at tamingthe Moslems,'' it said.   ``This campaign will only lead to failure because the era of thecrusaders' invasion is gone following the spread of the spirit ofmartyrdom that forced the (U.S.) Marines and the French to retreatin 1983,'' it said.   That was a reference to the twin suicide truck bomb attacks onOct. 23, 1983, against the U.S. Marine base and the headquarters ofFrench paratroopers in Beirut. The bombings killed 241 Americanservicemen and 58 French soldiers and led to withdrawal of aninternational peace force.   Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella for undergroundextremists holding 16 foreign hostages, including eight Americans,in Lebanon. The longest-held is Terry A. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press, who was kidnapped March 16,1985.   In a separate interview with the Central News Agency newsletter,an unidentified Hezbollah official was quoted as saying Israelshould immediately release an influential Moslem Shiite clericabducted by Israeli commandos last month. The kidnapping promptedone group to announce it had killed an American hostage, Marine Lt.Col. William Higgins, in retaliation.   France dispatched the aircraft carrier Foch, the destroyerCassard, and the destroyer Duquesne to the Mediterranean in recentdays while its envoy, Alain Decaux, discussed the crisis withLebanese officials.   Aoun, who serves as army commander and leader of a ChristianCabinet, was quoted Saturday as saying he would like to see Frenchforces get involved.   ``I would like a French military intervention, but I don't wantto compromise France with a Lebanese request. Up until now, we haveexhausted much of our human and material resources, and we need helpto continue the resistance,'' Aoun was quoted in an interview in theParis weekly Journal du Dimanche.   Aoun's 20,000 troops are outnumbered by Syrian's 40,000 soldiersand its allies. The Syrian soldiers came under terms of a 1976 ArabLeague peacekeeping mandate.   French officials say the movement of their forces in theMediterranean was designed to help evacuate the estimated 7,000French citizens if necessary. They say Paris has no intention ofintervening militarily.   One source close to the Jumblatt's group said his militia'smilitary police toured a Druse enclave in the Chouf mountains inrecent days ``instructing all physically fit men aged 16-40 toreport to party offices.'' The source spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Jumblatt also has been critical of the French naval buildup. Hesaid at a news conference Saturday: ``France still supports theMaronites.''   He was referring to Paris' strong links to the Christians beforeLebanon's independence in 1943.   ``If they insist (on intervening), then let the whole of Lebanonand the whole of the Middle Eest go up in flames,'' he said.   The pope has expressed outrage at the recent fighting in Lebanonand last week said he felt an ``imperative'' to visit the country.</TEXT></DOC>
