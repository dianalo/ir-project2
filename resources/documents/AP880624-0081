The heightened security culminated a week of tension andstudent-led rioting. Officials said nine people died in streetviolence, and the government has imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew,closed institutions of higher learning and prohibited all publicmeetings.   Buddhist pilgrims reported Thursday that students had moved intothe sprawling hilltop Shwedagon Pagoda, a centuries-old marvel ofgolden spires and stupas, to set up a ``strike center'' that wouldcoordinate anti-government protests.   However, pilgrims who entered the pagoda after it was reopenedtoday said they found no trace of student demonstrators.   Pagoda trustees who spoke on condition of anonymity saiduniversity students arrived in groups at the shrine on Wednesdayafternoon and probably mingled with worshippers before the 6:00p.m. government curfew.   The students were also said to have left later that day, thoughit was not clear whether they too were observing the curfew ordeparted for some other reason.   The trustees said security officials searched the temple groundsWednesday night and barred public access Thursday.   The week's protests have also caused classes to be suspended atschools in Mandalay, the country's second largest city.Anti-government protests have also been reported in Pegu, north ofRangoon, and in Moulmein, on the southeastern seacoast.   Since October, the 26-year-old regime of strongman U Ne Win hasbeen rocked by three violent protests in Rangoon and smaller onesin other parts of the country.   Diplomatic and other sources says lack of personal freedoms anda downward spiraling economy are fueling unrest.   Buddhist pagodas in Burma have traditionally been centers ofpolitical protest. In 1920, Rangoon students moved into theShwedagon grounds to launch agitation against the British, who werethen the colonial rulers in Burma.   The posting of guards at Sule, Botataung and other shrines todaywas viewed as a measure to prevent activists from entering theBuddhist holy places, where violence of any kind is forbidden.   Traffic increased in Rangoon today and all markets were open,although fewer shoppers were seen.   Last week, students at several institutions had peacefullydemonstrated for release of detained students and legalization ofstudent unions. Violence broke out after the government respondedby closing the schools.   On Tuesday, about 5,000 students and other protesters foughtpolice with stones.   Last March, police and military units brutally suppressed asimilar demonstration, arresting hundreds and killing what Westerndiplomats put at possibly up to 100 protesters.</TEXT></DOC>
