Hundreds of army vehicles including artillery and tanks paradedin front of the Royal Palace as a band played a song celebratingthe ``solidarity'' between Vietnam and Cambodia.   Several thousand people including Cambodian soldiers andschoolchildren lined the streets waving flags in yet anothergovernment-organized ceremony marking what Vietnam says is thewithdrawal of its final 26,000 troops.   Heng Samrin, president of the Vietnamese-installed government,thanked the commanders of departing Vietnamese units 479 and 979.Twelve Buddhist monks in saffron robes chanted blessings.   Cambodian and Vietnamese commanders embraced and were presentedflowers from women in traditional costumes.   After the brief ceremony, the soldiers headed east for theVietnamese border on narrow Highway No. 1. That was a main routeVietnamese forces used to invade Cambodia in late 1978 and endnearly four years of Khmer Rouge rule in which hundreds ofthousands died.   After an overnight rest, the soldiers were to cross from SveyRieng province to Vietnam's Tay Ninh province, supposedly endingHanoi's involvement in the stalemated war against the Khmer Rougeand two other guerrilla groups. Other units were to return home bythe Mekong River and the Gulf of Thailand.   The guerrillas have called the six-day troop movement a fake,but the Khmer Rouge has beseiged the gem-rich western town ofPailin in recent months, evidently to take advantage of aVietnamese retreat from the Thai border area.   The Khmer Rouge claimed today it had captured the Ratanamondoldistrict seat at Sdau township, on Route 10 which links the town ofBattambang with Pailin.   On its radio station, the Voice of the National Army ofDemocratic Kampuchea, the Khmer Rouge called the area a ``majorstrategic position whose task is to defend Battambang town from thesouth.'' A transcript of the radio report was seen in Bangkok.   Battambang is about 160 miles northwest of Phnom Penh.   The defense minister, Gen. Tea Banh, has acknowledged theguerrillas have seized territory around Pailin but says it remainsunder Phnom Penh control.   Phnom Penh's best division, the 196th, was defending Pailinagainst some 3,000 guerrillas of elite Khmer Rouge divisions 415and 320, said Khieu Kanharith, a prominent newspaper editor whorecently visited the front.   Khieu said the Khmer Rouge were raining 800 to 2,000 shellsdaily. He said the guerrillas trucked in ammunition from a shortdistance while Phnom Penh forces were supplied from bases 75 milesaway.   Since 1979, only soldiers have lived in Pailin, he said in aninterview.   The battle has intensified concern in the country over whetherthe army of the Vietnam-installed Phnom Penh government can handlethe guerrillas alone.   Some Phnom Penh residents have been stocking rice anticipatingthe guerrillas will cut off supplies to the city, Cambodianofficials said. Some senior government officials have been savingmoney and gold in case they need to flee abroad, Western aidofficials say.   Already many Vietnamese civilians, including entire villages offishermen, reportedly have fled back home.   The Khmer Rouge toppled the U.S.-backed Lon Nol government inApril 1975, and immediately drove the people of Phnom Penh into thecountryside at gunpoint. Attempting to turn Cambodia into aprimitive agrarian commune, they created slave labor camps thatbecame mass graves.   On Sunday, Phnom Penh's Prime Minister Hun Sen urged the mainnon-Communist resistance leader, Prince Norodom Sihanouk, to breakwith the Khmer Rouge and return home.   Sihanouk's hands have been ``soaked in blood'' by the alliance,he said.   Hun Sen called on China, Thailand and other countries to keepwhat he said were pledges to stop military aid to the guerrillasonce the Vietnamese have left.   ``We have clearly seen that our enemy has prepared alleventualities for civil war,'' he told a news conference. ``Thescope of the war will depend on the attitude of foreign countries.''   In a statement issued in Bangkok, Sihanouk said today he wouldonly take part in future peace talks if they are held within aninternational framework.   He rejected absolutely any negotiations with Hun Sen, and said areport on the Voice of America radio station that he had agreed tobilateral talks ``does not correspond with reality.''   Thailand has allowed the insurgents to set up camps in itsterritory, while China has armed them.   The Soviet ambassador, Rashit Khamidouline, has said hisgovernment is continuing arms supplies to Phnom Penh but notincreasing them as Vietnam retreats.   Hun Sen confirmed that he and guerrilla leaders have just agreedto resume peace talks.   But he said he would not back off from his demand that anysettlement must include dismantling the Khmer Rouge army andpolitical organization.   Talks in Paris failed in July after Hun Sen rejected guerrillademands that the Khmer Rouge be included in a transitionalgovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
