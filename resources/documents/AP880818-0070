Thank you, thank you, thank you. (Applause).   Can you imagine, can you imagine how hard it is to be the Grammof Gramm-Rudman?   Trying to do the Lord's work in the devil's city. Trying tobalance the budget and always seeing those terrible headlines:Gramm-Rudman Cuts, Gramm-Rudman Slashes, Gramm-Rudman Denies ...I'm still waiting for the headline: Gramm-Rudman Saves TaxpayersMoney.   And I've finally figured out why that headline is never written_ the people writing those headlines think that the moneygovernment spends comes from heaven. So, when government doesn'tspend it, it's lost.   But you and I know the real story.   The money government spends does not come from heaven. It comesout of the pockets of the working men and women of America, andwhen government does not spend our money, it's not lost. It stayswith families to invest in the American dream and, my friends,that's what this election is all about.   Do you remember what the world was like in January of 1981 whenRonald Reagan and George Bush took the oath of office?   The amnesia merchants of the Atlanta convention want us toforget that when the Democrats left the White House, inflation andinterest rates were at the highest levels in American history.Prices outstripped wages, workers grew poorer, retirees saw theirlives' savings destroyed. People couldn't build or buy their ownhomes or invest in their own businesses.   Remember how we resented it when Jimmy Carter told us we had tolearn to live on less? Of course that turned out to be the goodpart. The bad part was that the tax and spend policies of theDemocrats forced us to do it.   The amnesia Democrats of Atlanta may have forgotten all that,but we have not forgotten and, so help us God, we are not going toallow them to do that to America again.   Under the leadership of Ronald Reagan and George Bush, we've cuttaxes so that working people could keep more of what they earned.We gave people incentives to work, save and invest _ and they haveworked, and saved, and invested.   With government off our backs and out of our wallets, the geniusof our people re-emerged.   Inflation, the No. 1 problem in the '70s, has been virtuallyeliminated. We have created 17 million new permanent, taxpayingjobs with a future. Interest rates have plummeted and homeownership, always part of the American dream, is again part of theAmerican reality.   But while the world calls our economic rebirth a miracle, theDemocrats call it a disaster. They long for the failed policies ofthe past.   The Chinese communists may be coming out from behind theirideological Great Wall to recognize that government is the problemand free enterprise is the answer, and perestroika may bepermeating the walls of the Kremlin, but the message of economicfreedom and opportunity has yet to register with the Democrats.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
