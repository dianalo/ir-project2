 They were deliberately structured toprovide a commentary on what I expected to be key issues this year and theirlikely outcomes.andP;  What better way to end the year than to review thosepredictions?andM;First, the shift I predicted from an emphasis primarily on individualproductivity applications to using personal computers (and micro technologygenerallt) as building blocks for larger systems is clearly underway.andM;Replacing costly mainframe and minicomputer systems with micro-basedalternatives, &quot;downsizing,&quot; has become an important theme over the past 12months.andP;  The word I first used back in 1985 has become a common one in theindustry's vocabulary.andM;The significantly lower prices I predicted for 386-based systems, memoryPostScript printers, and other products have also come about as predicted.andO;By early this fall, prices had fallen dramatically, making what only a yearago were expensive high-end systems affordable today for the majority ofbuyers.andM;My predictions about a takeoff for OS/2 and closinf windows of opportunityfor Microsoft Windows, however, did not fare very well in 1990.andP;  OS/2 use didnot accelerate as I had thought it would, and the smashing success of Windows3.0 rolled mercilessly over my prediction.andM;Unrepentant sinner that I am, I still think the move onward to OS/2 willcome.andP;  I think I was just a bit ahead of my time.andP;  The renewed cooperationbetween IBM and Microsoft announced in September should help pave the way forOS/2.andP;  Still, I rate zeros on both these predictions for 1990.andM;My prediction that Unix would continue to go nowhere on the desktop, however,made it through the year with flying colors.andP;  For all the talk about Unix,and all the semi-fanatical enthusiasm on the part of its more zealouspartisan, Unix market share on office PCs isn't much different from what itwas a year ago.andM;That EISA would emerge as the dominant 32-bit bus standard for vendors otherthan IBM, and the MCA clones would go nowhere, also provided to be a correctprediction.andP;  MCA clones are all but a dead issue at this point, and EISAsystems are now available from the majority of vendors other than IBM.andM;Another prediction that fared well this year was that at least some of thetraditional PC software vendors would be in for a rough time.andP;  Ashton-Tate'sdifficulties were obvious to everyone, and once-mighty Lotus no longer leadsthe best-seller charts.andP;  The overall financial results for the establishedmarket leaders were generally disappointing.andM;I also said that IBM,'s OS/2 Exrended Edition and OfficeVision would &quot;treadwater, at best.&quot;andP;  Score another hit there.andP;  EE has had only minor impact sofar, and OfficeVision is reported to be in serious difficulty at this point.andM;My ninth prediction about 1990 being a &quot;banner year for lawyers&quot; was, ofcourse, undeniably correct.andP;  There hasn't been a more litigious year in theindustry in recent memory.andP;  Assertion of intellectual property rights seemsto have become nearly as important as building and selling good products fora depressingly large number of vendors.andM;The tenth prediction of big gains for network servers is arguably right orwrong depending on what aspects of the matter are emphasized.andP;  While sales ofconspicuous products like Compag's Systempro did not meet many people'sexpectations in 1990, a stunning array of vendors reading like a Who's Who inthe industry introduced server produdcts at a ferocious pace throughout 1990.andM;Ialso predicted a hard year for Apple.andP;  That has been borne out by twothings.andP;  First is Apple's declining financial fortunes in the calendar year1990.andP;  Also the denunciations of Apple's market strategy given at MacWorldExpo last August by the likes of Bill Campbell, then head of Apple's Clarissubsidiary, have demonstrated Apple's serious marketing difficulties.andM;This fall's new product introductions by Apple are aimed at turning thingsaround, but it remains to be seen how successful the company will be in doingso.andP;  Nevertheless, 1990 is not a year Apple would want to repeat.andM;While some diehards might want to argue the point, my prediction that &quot;NeXTIsn't&quot; also looks good.andP;  NeXT sales were poor through the first part of theyear.andP;  The much-vaunted deal with Businessland did nothing for NeXT andnothing for Businessland.andM;NeXT respondended to its dismal showing in the market with an improvedproduct line, including color systems, this fall.andP;  So far, however, there islittle convincing evidence that this latest (and probably last) effort ispaying off, either.andM;Finally, I said that IBM's epeatedly anticipated turnaround won't come in1990, either.andP;  We won't know for sure how that one turns out until IBMannounces its fourth-quarter financial results in mid-January.andP;  Based on whatwe've seen thus far, however, it looks like my prediction will prove correct.andM;The bottom line, therefore, looks to me like eight correct, two wrong, atleast for 1990 (OS/2 and Windows), two probables (NeXT and IBM), and one inbetween (network servers).andP;  That adds up to a win/lose/tie record of 8-2-3which will go up to 10-2-1 if NeXT doesn't turn out to be the favoritestocking stuffer this holiday season and IBM's financial results in thecurrent quarter are as dismal as I expect them to be.andM;CHANGING WAYS OF BUSINESSandM;Two events I didn't predict this year but wish I had may be even moreinteresting than the ones I did.andP;  The first is the spectacular growth ofsystem vendors that sell direct.andP;  Vendors like Austin, CompuAdd, Dell,Gateway 2000, Northgate, Swan, TriStar, and Zeos have radically and probablypermanently changed the distribution structure of the industry.andM;The second is the general decline of traditional computer storefront dealers.andO;Unable to meet their promise of service and support to justify higher prices,they have seen their role reduced over the past year.andP;  Only those who trulyadd value through expertise--MicroAge is a good example--continue to do well.andM;In retrospect, 1990 is likely to prove to have been a key transitional yearfor the industry.andP;  A number of important issues that were unsettled andunsettling in 1990 appear on their way to resulution as 1991 approaches.andO;Prospects are good for a solid resumption of growth in 1991, despite what maybe unfavorable conditions in the economy generally.andP;  That, however, is atopic for my upcoming predictions for 1991.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
