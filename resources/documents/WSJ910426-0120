Democratic Senate Leader Mitchell tries to shape a planthat would force employers to offer insurance or pay thegovernment to do so, but Senate Finance Chairman Bentsenprefers a more gradual approach. The Bush administrationgears up defensively in case Democrats make health a big '92campaign issue. One idea: Reducing state-mandated coverage tomake policies cheaper for small businesses.</LP><TEXT>   But a House Ways and Means Committee retreat produces noconsensus on major bills to expand access to health care orreduce high costs. GOP Rep. Gradison warns that there is nomoney for extensive health-care reform. &quot;There hasn't beenthe kind of grass-roots demand that's going to push and pullpoliticians into taking this very large step,&quot; says EdHoward, a former Pepper Commission official.   White House Budget Chief Darman knocks everyone else'shealth-care solutions, but offers none of his own yet.                                                                                                          WORRIES GROW about a new Mideast arms race despite U.S.calls for restraint.   Iran is believed to have more Soviet jets on the way andalso to be shopping for arms in Europe. &quot;My sense would bethat they would want to come back into the Western armsmarket,&quot; says Shaul Bakhash, an Iran analyst. Syria, whichU.S. officials believe got about $2 billion from the Saudisfor fighting Iraq, also is showing up in the world armsmarkets.   A new arms peddler in the region is North Korea, whoseoffered products include Scud missiles. The U.S. and SaudiArabia move slowly for now on plans for a big sale ofAmerican arms to the Saudis. &quot;It's hard to make the case&quot; forarms control &quot;when you're announcing arms sales yourself,&quot;one administration aide says.                                                                                                          REPUBLICANS WOO Hispanic voters in the push for free tradewith Mexico.   Despite opposition in Congress, the White House keeps thetrade issue on the front burner, figuring it is a &quot;wedge&quot;issue with Hispanics in the Southwest. That is why Bushscheduled talks with Hispanic leaders in California and Texasrecently. He is expected to hold more meetings at the WhiteHouse to showcase GOP support for improved economicopportunities for Mexico.   GOP pollster Ed Goas says early surveys show thatHispanics, especially in Texas and Arizona, support the tradepact. Pollster Andy Hernandez speculates there is a&quot;yearning&quot; among Mexican-Americans &quot;that the U.S. respectMexico in some fundamental way.&quot; But rank-and-file workersmay be open to labor arguments that the pact would cost manyof them their jobs.   Democrats are in the awkward position of having to opposeone of their constituencies: Hispanics or labor.                                                                                                          LABOR'S CLOUT in Congress deteriorates further, despiteheavy union political donations and campaign help forDemocrats. Senate leaders fail to back a bill to banpermanent striker replacements. Democratic leaders go slow onlegislation to shore up the unemployment compensation programamid rising joblessness.                                                                                                          STANDING BY? Transportation Secretary Skinner clears hiscalendar for June, canceling six appearances. The move fuelsspeculation he hopes to become attorney general if Thornburghruns for the late Pennsylvania Sen. Heinz's seat. But WhiteHouse Chief of Staff Sununu may have other attorney-generalcandidates.                                                                                                          AIRLINE RE-REGULATION plans rise in Congress. Under newHouse bills, the sale of international routes and airportlanding rights could go to carriers that would increasecompetition rather than to the highest bidder. Other billswould tighten rules for airline computer reservation systemsor even require carriers to sell their systems.                                                                                                          EUPHORIA FADES after the postwar optimism. Pollsters PeterHart and Richard Wirthlin both report sharp turnarounds onwhether the U.S. is on the right track. &quot;The `wrong track'answers are up by 20 points,&quot; Hart says, &quot;and we haven't evenhad the welcome-home parades.&quot;                                                                                                          CORPORATE MISCREANTS face stiffer fines with hotly debatedcourt guides.   The U.S. Sentencing Commission is expected to approvetoday proposals to Congress for fines of tens of millions ofdollars in cases of corporate pollution or fraud. Fines ofhundreds of millions of dollars will be urged for the mostserious cases. The Justice Department, however, stillbelieves that &quot;many of the fine levels are too low,&quot; says theagency's Paul Maloney.   Business groups lobby to get Congress to water down theproposals. They complain companies shouldn't be held liablefor acts committed inadvertently or by &quot;rogue employees.&quot; Butcongressional Democrats, still smarting from the Sandamp;L fiasco,want to appear to be tough on white collar crime and aren'tlikely to bend.   The guidelines automatically go into effect Nov. 1 ifCongress doesn't vote to block them.                                                                                                          MINOR MEMOS: Sununu, arriving late at a Washingtonfund-raiser, explains, &quot;I couldn't find a place to land.&quot; . .. Satirist Argus Hamilton says the U.S. is still trying todrive Saddam Hussein nuts: &quot;Just today, his wife received adozen red roses signed, `You were wonderful last night. Love,Frank Sinatra.'&quot; . . . FDIC chief Seidman notes that twoEastern states without real-estate-based banking problems areVermont, where rigid environmental laws prevented building,and South Carolina, &quot;where Hurricane Hugo blew it all down.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
