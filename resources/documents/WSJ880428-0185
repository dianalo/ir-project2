The natural way, as sociologist Jan Szczepanski has put it, is for a host of angels to descend from the heavens and hoist Poland toward prosperity. The miraculous way is for the Poles to do it themselves.    But don't expect any miracles.    Only three months after embarking on a reform promoted as the most daring in the East bloc, Poland is stuck again. In the hope of jolting supply and demand into market-like balance, reformers have implemented big price rises. But in fear of popular discontent, the state has caved in and allowed big wage rises, too.    So reform has derailed, inflation has blasted off -- and the people are discontent. Prices and wages each rose 45% in the first quarter. More price rises are due, and a few experts are talking of an 80% inflation rate by year's end. While reformers still hope to cut inflation-adjusted wages as much as 7% this year, even the official unions have refused to go along.    With the announcement of the price and wage statistics this week, at least 2,000 workers at a big steel mill near Krakow walked off the job and were still out yesterday. In the city of Bydgoszcz, transit crews won a 60% wage increase Monday after a 12-hour strike. In August 1980, another price-wage whirlpool gave life to the independent trade union, Solidarity, and 15 months of upheaval. Does this mean a new Polish August is in the offing?    &quot;It's too late,&quot; says a man at the gates of Gdansk's Lenin Shipyards, where it all began. He says he is an electrician but won't give his name. &quot;We're scared,&quot; he says. &quot;It's psychological terror.&quot; Like many workers, he feels the martial-law clampdown of 1981 proved protest leads nowhere in Poland. But that hardly puts Poles in the mood to sacrifice for the sake of official reform.    &quot;A worker cannot be stolen from,&quot; another man says. &quot;He has his demands. A horse isn't really concerned that the wagon is falling apart.&quot; This man is also an electrician at Lenin Shipyards, but he isn't afraid to give his name: Lech Walesa.    Mr. Walesa, Solidarity's leader, and his advisers argue that only far-reaching political reform will induce the Poles to accept austerity. Otherwise, economic reform will fail. If the state doesn't placate the workers, unrest will kill reform; if it does, inflation will do the job. The logic makes more sense than ever to hard-nosed foreign economists, yet real democracy still remains a task for Polish miracle workers.    &quot;The population is demanding fundamental political change and broad democratization as a condition for supporting the reform,&quot; says PlanEcon Report, which tracks the East bloc from Washington. This is something Poland's leader, Gen. Wojciech Jaruzelski, &quot;either cannot, or more likely, is not willing to offer.&quot;    Democratization was what Gen. Jaruzelski said he was offering when he called a referendum on reform in November. A coalition of &quot;no&quot; voters and nonvoters rejected his agenda of even-harsher price rises. But in light of what followed, it seems Poles didn't reject reform so much as the government that proposed it.    Since Feb. 1, centrally fixed prices for food have jumped by 40%, gasoline by 60%, public transportation by 67%, heating by 100% and rent by 200%. The government promised not to let living standards drop, and offered across-the-board wage increases that came to all of $4.37 (at the official exchange rate) a month. The unions balked, pushed for $17 and won $15.    It didn't end there. In Poland, as in other communist countries, managers who know how to play the system think of wages as revenues, not costs. They gladly pay workers more, as long as it keeps them quiet. The more politically dangerous the workers, the more they get.    Details are hard to pin down, but economists guess that some factories have dished out increases at five times the norm. One government newspaper reported that construction workers at the Zarnow nuclear power station received bonuses, in advance, of as much as $1,750.    This may have made sense to reformers if the workers had been rewarded for higher productivity, but they weren't. Managers, by the same token, have felt free to jack up prices on the 50% of Polish products the state doesn't regulate. Their customers have no choice: Coal users can't rush out to buy insulation when the state still fails to make enough of it.    The state has devised a tax that intends to apply uniform limits on wage increases at all companies regardless of productivity or profitability. And it has put a 36% lid on price increases that theoretically are free. Both efforts, neither of which has worked, fly in the face of reform.    &quot;This tax kills all incentives for efficiency,&quot; says university economist Jan Mujzel. Government spokesman Jerzy Malkowski doesn't dispute that. &quot;We do it out of desperation,&quot; he says.    Gen. Jaruzelski threatened last month to go a step further and call for &quot;special powers&quot; to make reform work. He didn't say what kind of powers, but some suggest they might be used to fire the least compliant of company managers.    Special powers, though, won't please anybody. Reformers say managers ought to sink or swim on profit-making skills alone. The most vulnerable managers are those with conservative connections in the Communist Party, and the protective support of their well-paid workers. Worse, the notion of special powers evokes an image of martial law. The Poles are angry enough as it is.    On Gdansk's main street, chocolate and coffee fill shop shelves for the first time in years. As reform dictates, prices have gone up and demand has dropped. Poles who can't afford to buy resent that. The toilet-paper price has also risen, but supply hasn't. So a line for toilet paper stretches a block, and Poles resent that, too.    Nearby, meanwhile, one shop has achieved a miraculous balance. It sells dresses. It is busy. And it is private. &quot;I sell a lot,&quot; says Krystyna Zdziarska, who owns the place. &quot;My costs go up. I don't raise prices. I cut prices! I want to sell everything. I want people to buy! It's a different approach to economics.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
