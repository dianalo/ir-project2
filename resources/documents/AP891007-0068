Manuel Antonio Noriega, but the nextU.S. moves are more likely to involve dollars than bullets.   The new economic strictures under consideration to step uppressure on Noriega include the withholding of about $1.5 millionin taxes paid monthly to his government on behalf of Panamanianemployees of U.S. agencies, officials said.   The officials, who asked not to be identified, said discussionsabout new sanctions against Panama began well before the failedcoup attempt last Tuesday. According to the Treasury Department,sanctions imposed to date have deprived Panama of about $400million.   Other economic measures under consideration, the officials said,include limiting even further the payments U.S. companies operatingin Panama can make to the government and prohibitingPanamanian-flag vessels from using U.S. ports. It was not clearwhat such additional sanctions would cost Panama.   Not all the options under discussion are economic in nature.   Administration officials have sounded out congressionalintelligence committees on the possibility of U.S. covert actionsagainst Noriega but none has been approved, said the sources, whodeclined to be more specific.   Bush talked briefly to reporters Friday and defended hisdecision not to commit U.S. forces to aid Panamanian rebels duringlast Tuesday's coup attempt. When asked whether he might authorizemilitary action in the future, the president replied, ``I would notrule out any option.''   The administration is still convinced that a steady weakening ofthe Panamanian economy will make Noriega's rule increasinglyuntenable and eventually force his removal, the officials said.   The economic decline Panama has suffered since early 1988 wasone of the factors cited by the coup plotters in justifying theiraction, the sources noted.   By a vote of 99-1, the Senate adopted a resolution proposed bySen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., on Thursday that expressed support for Bush'sefforts to democratize Panama through a ``full range of economic,diplomatic and military options.''   But the administration does not appear intent on deviating toofar from the policy of economic denial and diplomatic pressureinstituted by former President Reagan 19 months ago.   Among other measures, the United States has withheld payments toPanama for canal operations and has frozen an estimated $300million worth of Panamanian assets in U.S. banks. Some tradebenefits, including sugar exports, also have been denied.   Bush has hoped these measures would damage the Panamanianeconomy to the point that the Defense Forces would move againstNoriega. His actions last Tuesday at the time of the coup attemptindicate a strong preference to limit direct U.S. militaryinvolvement in efforts to oust Noriega.   The administration is not contemplating a complete trade embargoagainst Panama because that would put hundreds of U.S. companiesoperating there out of business, the officials said.   Bush has come under criticism from many members of Congress aswell as from some conservative outside government for not movingmore aggressively in support of the coup leaders last Tuesday.   Former Assistant Secretary of State for Inter-American AffairsElliott Abrams said the U.S. policy of ``speeches and sanctions''against Noriega is not enough.   ``To borrow a slogan from Theodore Roosevelt, who was profoundlyinvolved in Panamanian affairs, it's time for the U.S. to speakmore softly but carry _ and contemplate using _ a big stick,''Abrams says.   But former Ambassador Sol Linowitz, who helped negotiate thePanama Canal treaties, says that military action could put at riskthe 50,000 American citizens in Panama.   ``The military option can't be done without significantbloodshed,'' Linowitz told a reporter Thursday. He also opposesadditional sanctions because the ones already in place have``destroyed the economy without budging Noriega.''   Linowitz advocates reviving the diplomatic effort in theOrganization of American States _ suspended six weeks ago _ aimedat negotiating a restoration of democratic rule in Panama.   According to U.S. officials, there are about 18,000 Panamaniansworking for the Panama Canal Commission and other U.S. agencies.The $1.5 million the U.S. government pays to Panama on behalf ofthe Panamanian employees of U.S. agencies ostensibly is used foreducation and health care but American officials believe the fundsare used for other purposes.   They acknowledged that the Panamanian government could retaliate_ by withholding health and education benefits _ against employeeswhose taxes are not paid by U.S. agencies.   Noriega is said to need $30 million to $40 million a month torun the government, and officials believe ways must be found to cutinto his income as much as possible without destroying thePanamanian economy in the process.</TEXT></DOC>
