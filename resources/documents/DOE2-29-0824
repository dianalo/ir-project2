Ten objectives related to this area arepriorities for the national control effort. Progress is reviewed on thosepriorities within the responsibilities of the Public Health Service.Six key program elements, or types of support activities, are deemedessential to preventing, identifying, and controlling toxic agent andradiation threats. Significant progress has been made toward achievingobjectives for which all key program elements have been successfullyimplemented to provide the requisite know-how, manpower, and tools. Importantadvances have been made in reducing the blood lead levels of the population,reducing unnecessary exposure to medical X-rays, evaluating the toxicitiesof chemicals in toxic waste dumps, and improving the scientific and technicalinformation base and its availability for prevention and control efforts.The most important priority for the forseeable future will be to expandour knowledge of potential health risks posed by toxic agents and radiation.Expanded surveillance systems and data bases are essential to determiningthe extent of the problems in terms of human health effects and for measuringthe impact of prevention programs. Emphasis on the activities embodiedin the key elements will encourage the expansion of the knowledge baseand its effective application to prevention and control problems.</TEXT></DOC>
