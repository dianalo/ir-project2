John Poindexter, then the National Security Adviser, in a computer message sent to his predecessor Robert McFarlane. Dated Feb. 1, 1986, the memo was soon followed by the first shipments of U.S. arms to Iran that month. House and Senate investigators said it represents the most tangible evidence to date of Mr. Bush's stand on the controversial policy.    Meanwhile, Central Intelligence Agency Director William Webster's decision to discipline several CIA officers for improper activities in the Iran-Contra affair was applauded in Congress after being announced yesterday. But intelligence sources said one official's punishment was reduced after he objected vehemently to it, and another official has indicated to associates that he, too, may resist the punishment ordered by Mr. Webster.    Mr. Bush's aides played down the Poindexter memo as &quot;nothing new,&quot; but its disclosure could make it more difficult for the vice president to separate himself from the controversy as he seeks the Republican nomination for president next year. Throughout his campaign, Mr. Bush has sought to make a virtue of his loyalty to Mr. Reagan, but since early this year he also has insisted that he expressed &quot;reservations&quot; about the initiative and knew little about how it was carried out.    For example, in a recent televised debate, the vice president portrayed the policy as more the president's than his own, without saying what advice he had given. &quot;I'm not going to take you back over the whole course of what the president thought he was doing or not,&quot; said Mr. Bush. But his questioner in that debate, former Secretary of State Alexander Haig, renewed his demands for an explanation yesterday.    The issue is complicated by the fact that Adm. Poindexter has never been questioned on the memo, which was discovered only after completion of a House-Senate report last month on the Iran-Contra affair. The former security adviser had an interest himself in promoting the initiative, and investigators released two other messages yesterday indicating the Navy officer was anxious to calm any fears by Mr. McFarlane.    Altogether 96 messages -- most of them never seen before -- have been recently found in White House files by applying a more sophisticated technique for searching the computers' electronic memory. No decision has yet been made on their release, but those disclosed yesterday raise new questions as well about Israel's role in the affair.    Intelligence sources said CIA Director Webster stayed an order demoting Alan Fiers, the head of the CIA's Central America Task Force, when Mr. Fiers vowed to quit at what was described as an &quot;emotional&quot; meeting in Mr. Webster's office and then enlisted support from other administration officials. The Wall Street Journal yesterday reported that Mr. Fiers is being reprimanded and demoted.    The sources said Mr. Webster has &quot;suspended,&quot; not dropped, his decision to transfer Mr. Fiers to a lower-ranking job, and has ordered a reprimand to remain on his record for the next two years. CIA spokesman Bill Baker said Mr. Webster took Mr. Fiers's &quot;exemplary record&quot; into account in deciding what action was appropriate.    Other officials suggested the administration isn't eager for a messy purge of the agency's Central American operations at a time when disclosures of a planned Nicaraguan military buildup may have improved the chances of winning congressional approval for renewed aid to the CIA-backed Contras.    Intelligence sources said another senior CIA officer, Duane &quot;Dewey&quot; Clarridge, the head of the agency's Counterterrorism Center, was reprimanded and urged to retire by Mr. Webster. But according to associates, Mr. Clarridge hasn't decided whether to accept the disciplinary action or to resist it.    In addition, intelligence sources said Charles Allen, the CIA's National Intelligence Officer for counterterrorism, also received a letter of reprimand.    Two lower-ranking officials, the former CIA station chief in Costa Rica and the chief of an agency base at Aguacate, Honduras, were dismissed for helping deliver arms to Nicaraguan rebels during the period when Congress barred U.S. military aid to the Contras, the sources said.    Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman David Boren (D., Okla.) hailed Mr. Webster's actions as &quot;strong, but balanced and fair,&quot; and added that they &quot;send a strong signal that the leadership of the CIA is strongly committed to the rule of law.&quot;    Mr. Webster, who has been under pressure from the congressional intelligence committees to tighten controls on covert action, yesterday also announced plans to strengthen the CIA inspector general's office, adopt new guidelines governing congressional testimony by agency officials, and protect the CIA's analyses from political influence.    &quot;This has been a testing chapter in the history of the CIA,&quot; Mr. Webster said in a statement. &quot;A number of people who engaged in activities determined to be improper have been disciplined. On the other hand, I am proud to note that evidence in the record suggests that the overwhelming majority of our employees acted in a professional manner within the policy and legal guidance with which they were provided.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
