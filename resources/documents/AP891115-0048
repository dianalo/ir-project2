Both Cristiani's rightist administration and the Marxist-ledFarabundo Marti National Liberation Front claimed widespreadpopular support. More than 500 people have been reported killed and1,000 wounded in the fighting.   The government battled guerrillas holding poor districts on thecapital's northern outskirts on Tuesday, the military's helicoptergunships pouring fire on at least one working-class neighborhood.   Thousands of residents remained trapped in their homes by theheavy fighting and civilian casualties were high. The governmentdeclared a 24-hour curfew in seven northern neighborhoods whereguerrilla fighters had dug in.   Fighting was also reported in eastern provinces, to which travelis restricted.   Rebel commander Ana Guadalupe Martinez, speaking early today onthe insurgents' clandestine Radio Venceremos, said the guerrillashad declared more than a quarter of the Massachusetts-sized country``liberated.''   She said revolutionary committees had been set up in dozens oftowns.   ``We call on the popular committees to give priority to the taskof supporting the combatants ... to form militias, to constructworkshops of popular armament, to collect food, medicine andbandages and organize the means of getting them to the combatzones,'' she said.   Cristiani said the offensive, begun Saturday night, ``has been afailure'' for the guerrillas.   ``The harshest blow to them has been the repudiation of thepeople,'' he said in a speech broadcast nationwide Tuesday night.``This (the offensive) is the act of a desperate beast.''   The combat, a state of siege, a dusk-to-dawn curfew and aguerrilla-imposed road transport ban made circulation difficult, attimes impossible.   These conditions hampered efforts to gauge the degree to whichthe general population was being swayed toward either side.   The streets were deserted overnight for the third straight night.   Red flares dropped by helicopters drifted over the Mejicanosneighborhood and tracer-laced bursts from the gunships' .30-calibermachine guns sporadically blasted the working-class district.   Mejicanos was one of several neighborhoods on the capital'speriphery where insurgents were entrenched.   The fighting was been the fiercest since the rebels' ``finaloffensive'' of January 1981 failed to win them power.   At least 500 people have been killed in the battle of SanSalvador, with nearly double that number wounded, according to themilitary hospitals and morgue reports.   A 10-year-old civil war between the rebels and a succession ofU.S.-backed governments has claimed an estimated 70,000 people,most of them civilians.   Rebel leaders ordered the offensive after announcing they wouldnot participate in peace talks scheduled for next week inVenezuela. They said Cristiani's government was not negotiatingseriously and blamed it for the Oct. 31 bombing of a unionheadquarters that killed 10 people and wounded 29.   Two leftist political leaders who had been operating publiclysince late 1987 took refuge in the Mexican and Venezuelanembassies. The leaders, Guillermo Ungo and Ruben Zamora, have notasked for asylum, and are described by their hosts as ``guests.''   Many leaders of union, peasant and student organizationsconsidered guerrilla fronts by the government have gone undergroundthis week.   Cristiani, a rightist who took office June 1, said governmentforces had ``neutralized'' insurgents on San Salvador'ssoutheastern, southern and western periphery, but that combatcontinued with dug-in rebels on the northern outskirts.   ``The army is advancing, but advancing slowly,'' he said. Heaccused the guerrillas of holding civilians ``hostage'' and ofusing them as ``screens'' against army counteroffensives.   ``There is no danger whatever of the government being toppled,''he said.   Cristiani denied air force planes and helicopters had bombardedcivilian zones where the guerrillas are dug in. He acknowledgedthat rebel positions were strafed.   Gen. Humberto Larios, minister of defense, said helicopters havefired rockets at guerrilla positions.   Nearly 100 civilians have been killed and more than 680 woundedin San Salvador since Saturday night, many reportedly casualties ofair attacks.   The New York-based human rights organization Americas Watch onTuesday called on both the armed forces and the rebels to respectthe articles of the Geneva Conventions obliging belligerents totake all measures possible to prevent civilian casualties.   Pedro Varela, spokesman for the Salvadoran Red Cross, said thelocal organization had appealed to the International Red Cross inGeneva to mediate a 72-hour truce between the government and theguerrilla command.   He said the International Red Cross agreed to try to arrange themeasure, which would be used to evacuated wounded and civiliansfrom combat zones.</TEXT></DOC>
