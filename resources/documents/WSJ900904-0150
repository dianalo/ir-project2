The struggling auto maker needs the cost cuts to cope witha surge in buyer-incentive costs to an industry average ofabout $1,250 a vehicle, up from just $500 a vehicle two yearsago, said Lee A. Iacocca, the company's chairman. &quot;If we canget to $2.5 billion, I'll give our guys a lot of credit,&quot; hesaid. &quot;The last $1 billion obviously gets a little harder.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   In an interview, Mr. Iacocca said that, had his travelschedule been slightly different, he might have been caughtin the midst of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. He had beenscheduled to depart Nov. 1 on a trip to Kuwait and SaudiArabia to visit new distributors of Chrysler products. Thetrip was canceled after the invasion.   The executive also made the following points:   -- Chrysler is committed to maintaining its common-stockdividend, currently 30 cents a share quarterly. At thecurrent price of $13.875 a share the stock's dividend yieldis 8.6%, and Chrysler's cumulative earnings during the pastthree quarters haven't been enough to cover the payout. &quot;Butall good companies go through some periods where they don'tearn the dividend but continue to pay it,&quot; Mr. Iacocca said.   -- The departure in May of Gerald Greenwald as Chrysler'svice chairman was &quot;a bit of an emotional jolt for me&quot; becausehe had selected Mr. Greenwald to succeed him one day. The toptwo contenders now are vice chairman R.S. Miller, 48 yearsold, and Robert A. Lutz, the 58-year-old president ofChrysler Motors. &quot;I'll watch the two of them for the next 12months and make a decision,&quot; Mr. Iacocca said, adding,however, that he won't retire &quot;until things are squared away&quot;at Chrysler.   -- Chrysler hopes to find &quot;a good European partner&quot; tocooperate on vehicle development and distribution, and iscurrently talking with several companies, including Italy'sFiat S.p.A. &quot;Will anything come of those?&quot; he asked. &quot;Nothingyet. Will it be a big deal? I would think it will start withthings like minivans and Jeeps, our strengths.&quot; It's lesslikely, Mr. Iacocca added, that a foreign auto maker wouldbuy a big equity stake in Chrysler, because Chrysler doesn'tcurrently need a cash infusion and prospective buyers arewary. &quot;It's the old story,&quot; he said. &quot;They want to wait andsee how well you're doing.&quot;   Mr. Iacocca portrayed his cost-cutting effort as crucialto returning Chrysler to healthy profitability. The companyalready is close to reaching its initial goal of cutting $1.5billion from its cost base, he said, since the program beganlast July.   Without those cuts, he added, Chrysler would be running inthe red right now. The company's first-half earnings plunged64% from a year ago, to $251 million on sales of $16.5billion.   If Chrysler's cost cuts can reach $2.5 billion, Mr.Iacocca explained, the company should weather the next twoyears without eating into its $4.5 billion of cash on hand.By then, Chrysler will be launching a crucial line ofmid-sized cars code-named LH.   But the wild card, Mr. Iacocca acknowledged, is if car andtruck sales take an unexpectedly steep plunge in the monthsahead, perhaps because of the Persian Gulf crisis. In thatcase, he said, &quot;the worst I think will happen is we'll runthrough $750 million in cash in each of the next two years.I'll blow a full $1.5 billion, but I'll still have $3 billionto run on without any sweat at night.&quot;   Chrysler's cost-cutting methods have included a broadrange of actions, from layoffs and company-travelrestrictions to eliminating most company-paid newspapers andmagazine subscriptions. The company also eliminated meritraises for salaried employees and bonuses for eligibleexecutives.   Some of the measures are being undone. Chrysler reinstatedmerit raises a few months ago. And 1,800 senior employeeswill receive stock awards to offset the loss of their bonuspay, which can be one-third or more of an executive's totalcompensation.   Still, the stringency has taken its toll on morale. Whilethe resignations of Mr. Greenwald and a couple of otherhigh-level executives have received the most publicity, manyat Chrysler are more concerned about departures inupper-middle management, where many operationalresponsibilities lie.   For example, Mr. Iacocca acknowledged that severalengineers with expertise in the key area of tailpipeemissions recently have left Chrysler for Ford Motor Co.Another top engineer has returned to teaching, and ahigh-level management-information specialist has left to joinHoneywell Inc.   Also, Michael V. Howe, who as general manager of theChrysler-Plymouth division had a high-level marketing job,recently left to run the Detroit office of Young andamp; Rubicam,an advertising agency that handles the account of Ford'sLincoln-Mercury division.   Mr. Iacocca acknowledged that keeping morale up atChrysler has been &quot;increasingly difficult&quot; lately. But he wasphilosophical about the recent departures. &quot;The fact that youlose some good guys isn't all bad,&quot; he said. &quot;Because if yourguys were never looked at {by other companies}, you'd think,`Gee, I thought I had such great guys, but nobody wants thembut me.'&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
