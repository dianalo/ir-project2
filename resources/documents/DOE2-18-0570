At 0.02 T the frequency difference between fat and water is about3 Hz. Field echo images were produced and the known phase differencebetween the fat and water was used to decompose the complex image intothe fat and water components. At 0.02 T the optimal echo time is of theorder of 60 msec, depending on the T2 values of the tissues of interest.The phase errors due to the main field inhomogeneity were corrected usingtwo-dimensional polynomials fitted to water phantom images.</TEXT></DOC>
