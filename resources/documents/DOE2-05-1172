It was considered importantthat this framework lend itself to the eventual integration of the variousartificial intelligence techniques. Fuzzy Set Theory provided an elegantway to extend the notions developed for black andamp; white images to thosefor colored/grey-valued images. A priori generalizations of fuzzy setsare proposed, enabling effective application of the Fuzzy Set Theory.The various operations on fuzzy sets and possibility distributions studiedare maximum, minimum, complement, sum, product, difference, quotient,and scalar multiplication. It is shown that the semantics of the underlyingoperations are preserved by the operations induced by them. The fuzzysets are used to represent colors of the pixels in the colored digitalimage model; whereas the possibility distributions are used to representthe possible grey values of a pixel in the grey-valued digital imagemodel. Two morphological covariance functions are proposed for effectivecharacterization of images. A space-time efficient algorithm to computethese functions is also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
