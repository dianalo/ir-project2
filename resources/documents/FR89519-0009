Thesechemical impurities have been shown to cause cancer in test animals. Residualamounts of reactants and manufacturing aids, such as ethylene oxide and1,4-dioxane, are commonly found as contaminants in chemical products, includingmost food additives.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Determination of Safety</ITAG>Under section 409(c)(3)(A) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act(the act) (21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)), the so-called ``general safety clause''of the statute, a food additive cannot be approved for a particular useunless a fair evaluation of the data available to FDA establishes thatthe additive is safe for that use. The concept of safety embodied in theFood Additives Amendment of 1958 is explained in the legislative historyof the provision: ``Safety requires proof of a reasonable certainty thatno harm will result from the proposed use of an additive. It does not andcannot require proof beyond any possible doubt that no harm will resultunder any conceivable circumstance.'' H. Rept. 2284, 85th Cong., 2d Sess.4 (1958). This definition of safety has been incorporated into FDA's foodadditive regulations (21 CFR 170.3(i)). The anticancer or Delaney clauseof the Food Additives Amendment of 1958 (section 409(c)(3)(A) of the act(21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A))) provides further that no food additive shallbe deemed to be safe if it is found to induce cancer when ingested by manor animal.In the past, FDA has often refused to approve a use of an additive thatcontained or was suspected of containing even minor amounts of a carcinogenicchemical, even though the additive as a whole had not been shown to causecancer. The agency now believes, however, that developments in scientifictechnology and experience with risk assessment procedures make it possiblefor FDA to establish the safety of additives that contain a carcinogenicchemical but that have not themselves been shown to cause cancer.In the preamble to the final rule permanently listing Dandamp;C Green No.6, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 2, 1982 (47 FR 14138), FDA explainedthe basis for approving the use of a color additive that had not been shownto cause cancer, even though it contains a carcinogenic impurity. Sincethat decision, FDA has approved the use of other color additives and foodadditives on the same basis.An additive that has not been shown to cause cancer but contains a carcinogenicimpurity may properly be evaluated under the general safety clause of thestatute using risk assessment procedures to determine whether there isa reasonable certainty that no harm will result from the proposed use ofthe additive. The agency's position is supported by <T3>Scott </T3>v. <T3>FDA, </T3>728 F.2d 322 (6th Cir. 1984). That case involved a challengeto FDA's decision to approve the use of Dandamp;C Green No. 5, which containsa carcinogenic chemical but has itself not been shown to cause cancer.Relying heavily on the reasoning in the agency's decision to list thiscolor additive, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit rejectedthe challenge to FDA's action and affirmed the listing regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Safety of Petitioned Use</ITAG>Sanitizing solutions are mixtures of chemicals. Each listed component ina sanitizing solution must have a functional effect. The subject sanitizingsolution contains two short-chain fatty acids_decanoic acid and octanoicacid. In addition, the solution contains phosphoric acid, a mixture of1-octanesulfonic acid and 1-octanesulfonic-2-sulfinic acid or 1, 2-octanedisulfonicacid, lactic acid, FDandamp;C Yellow No. 5, and the condensate of four molesof poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene) block copolymers with one mole ofethylenediamine. The functions of each component are described below.A. Short Chain Fatty AcidsThe two short chain fatty acids, decanoic acid and octanoic acid, are antimicrobialagents in the subject sanitizing solution and are used in a regulated sanitizingsolution listed in 21 CFR 178.1010 (b)(27) and (c)(22). On the basis ofthe data submitted in support of that regulated use, and the data containedin the food additive petition submitted in support of this sanitizing solution,FDA finds that the use of these fatty acids in the subject sanitizing solutionis safe.B. Phosphoric AcidPhosphoric acid functions as a pH stabilizer in the subject sanitizingsolution. Phosphoric acid is listed in 21 CFR 182.1073 as generally recognizedas safe (GRAS) for direct use in food. On the basis of the data containedin the food additive petition submitted in support of this sanitizing solutionand other available data, FDA finds that the use of phosphoric acid inthe subject sanitizing solution is safe.C. A Mixture of 1-Octanesulfonic Acid and 1-Octanesulfonic-2-Sulfinic Acid,or 1,2-Octanedisulfonic Acid (OSA Mixture)This OSA mixture functions as a surface-active agent in the subject sanitizingsolution. The mixture is a 40-percent aqueous solution of 1-octanesulfonicacid (25 percent minimum) and 1-octanesulfonic-2-sulfinic acid or 1,2-octanedisulfonicacid (9.0 percent maximum). This mixture is not regulated for use in sanitizingsolutions. On the basis of the data contained in the food additive petitionsubmitted in support of this sanitizing solution, FDA finds that the useof this mixture in the subject sanitizing solution is safe.D. Lactic AcidLactic acid assists in stabilizing the subject sanitizing solution formulation.On the basis of the data contained in the food additive petition submittedin support of this sanitizing solution and other available data, FDA findsthat the use of lactic acid in the subject sanitizing solution is safe.E. FDandamp;C Yellow No. 5FDandamp;C Yellow No. 5 functions as a colorant in the subject sanitizingsolution and should be used at levels intended to perform its functionaleffect. On the basis of the data contained in the food additive petitionsubmitted in support of this sanitizing solution and other available data,FDA finds that the use of FDandamp;C Yellow No. 5 in the subject sanitizingsolution is safe.F. Ethoxylated EmulsifierFDA estimates that the petitioned use of the condensate of four moles ofpoly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene) block copolymers with one mole of ethylenediaminewill result in extremely low levels of exposure to this additive. Thissubstance functions as a defoaming agent in the subject sanitizing solution.The agency has calculated the estimated intake of this substance basedon the probable concentration of the additive in the daily diet from itsuse on food-processing equipment and utensils. The estimated daily intakefor the additive is 7.0 micrograms per person per day for a 60-kilogramperson (2.3 parts per billion of the total daily diet).FDA does not ordinarily consider chronic testing to be necessary to determinethe safety of an additive whose use will result in very low exposure levels(Refs. 1 and 2), and the agency has not required such testing here. However,the petitioner did submit data from an acute toxicity test in rats. Noadverse effects were reported in this study.As stated above, the condensate of four moles of poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene)block copolymers with one mole of ethylenediamine may contain 1,4-dioxaneand ethylene oxide, substances that have been shown to cause cancer intest animals. These impurities may be present as a result of manufacturingprocedures used to produce this emulsifier. Because the additive has notbeen shown to cause cancer, however, the anticancer clause does not applyto it.FDA has evaluated the safety of this ethoxylated emulsifier under the generalsafety clause, using risk assessment procedures to estimate the upper boundrisk presented by 1,4-dioxane and ethylene oxide that may be present asimpurities in this additive. Based on this evaluation, FDA has concludedthat the chemical is safe under the proposed conditions of use.The risk assessment procedures that FDA used in this evaluation are similarto the methods that it has used to examine the risk associated with thepresence of minor carcinogenic impurities in various other food and coloradditives that contain carcinogenic impurities (see, e.g., 49 FR 13018,13019; April 2, 1984). The risk evaluation of the carcinogenic impuritiesethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane has two aspects: (1) Assessment of the worstcase exposure to the impurities from the proposed use of the additive;and (2) extrapolation of the risk observed in the animal bioassays to theconditions of probable exposure to humans.1. <T3>1,4-Dioxane. </T3>Based on the fraction of the daily diet that maybe in contact with surfaces and articles containing residues of the condensateof four moles of poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene) block copolymer withone mole of ethylenediamine, as well as the level of 1,4-dioxane that maybe present in this additive, FDA estimated that the hypothetical worstcase exposure to 1,4-dioxane from the use of this additive in the sanitizingsolution would not exceed 0.07 nanograms per person per day (Ref. 5). Theagency used data in a carcinogenesis bioassay on 1,4-dioxane conductedfor the National Cancer Institute (Ref. 4) to estimate the upper boundlevel of lifetime human risk from exposure to this chemical stemming fromthe proposed use of the poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene) adduct of ethylenediaminedefoamer in the sanitizing solution. The results of the bioassay on 1,4-dioxanedemonstrated that the material was carcinogenic for female rats under theconditions of the study. The test material caused significantly increasedincidences of squamous cell carcinomas and hepatocellular tumors in femalerats.The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's Cancer Assessment Committeereviewed this bioassay and other relevant data available in the literatureand concluded that the findings of carcinogenicity were supported by thisinformation on 1,4-dioxane. The committee further concluded that an estimateof the upper bound risk from potential exposure to 1,4-dioxane stemmingfrom the proposed use of the poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene) adductof ethylenediamine defoamer could be calculated from the bioassay.The agency used a quantitative risk assessment procedure (linear proportionalmodel) to extrapolate from the dose used in the animal experiment to thevery low doses encountered under the proposed conditions of use. This procedureis not likely to underestimate the actual risk from very low doses andmay, in fact, exaggerate it because the extrapolation models used are designedto estimate the maximum risk consistent with the data. For this reason,the estimate can be used with confidence to determine to a reasonable certaintywhether any harm will result from the proposed conditions and levels ofuse of poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene) adduct of ethylenediamine.Based on a worst case exposure of 0.07 nanograms per person per day, FDAestimates that the upper bound level of individual lifetime risk from potentialexposure to 1,4-dioxane from the use of this poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene)adduct of ethylenediamine defoamer is 2.5andmultiply;10^12 or less than 1in 400 billion. Because of the numerous conservatisms in the exposure estimate,lifetime-averaged individual exposure to 1,4-dioxane is expected to besubstantially less than the estimated daily intake, and therefore the calculatedupper bound risk would be less. Thus, the agency concludes that there isa reasonable certainty of no harm from exposure to 1,4-dioxane that resultsfrom the use of this poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene) adduct of ethylenediaminedefoamer.2. <T3>Ethylene oxide. </T3>Based on the fraction of the daily diet that maybe in contact with surfaces containing the poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene)adduct of ethylenediamine, as well as levels of ethylene oxide that maybe present in the additive, FDA estimated the hypothetical worst case exposureto ethylene oxide to be 0.07 nanograms per person per day (Ref. 5). Theagency used data in a carcinogenesis bioassay on ethylene oxide conductedfor the Institute of Hygiene, University of Mainz, West Germany (Ref. 3),to estimate the upper bound level of lifetime human risk from exposureto this chemical stemming from the proposed use of this poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene)adduct of ethylenediamine defoamer. The results of the bioassay on ethyleneoxide demonstrated that this material was carcinogenic for female ratsunder the conditions of the study. The test material caused significantlyincreased incidences of squamous cell carcinoma of the forestomach andcarcinoma in situ of the glandular stomach.The Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition's Cancer Assessment Committeereviewed the bioassay and other relevant data available in the literatureand concluded that this information on ethylene oxide supported the findingof carcinogenicity. The committee further concluded that an estimate ofthe upper bound level of lifetime human cancer risk from potential exposureto ethylene oxide could be calculated from the bioassay. Based on a worst case exposure of 0.07 nanograms per person per day, FDAestimates, using the linear proportional model, that the upper bound levelof individual lifetime risk from potential exposure to ethylene oxide fromthe use of poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene) adduct of ethylenediamineis 1.3X10^10, or less than 1 in 8 billion. Because of numerous conservatismsin the exposure estimate, lifetime-averaged individual exposure to ethyleneoxide is expected to be substantially less than the estimated daily intake,and, therefore, the calculated upper bound risk would be less. Thus, theagency concludes that there is a reasonable certainty of no harm from theexposure to ethylene oxide that results from the use of the poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene)adduct of ethylenediamine defoamer.G. Need for Specifications The agency has also considered whether specifications are necessary tocontrol the amount of the ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxane impurities inthe poly(oxyethylene)poly(oxypropylene) adduct of ethylenediamine defoamer.The agency finds that a specification is not necessary for the followingreasons: (1) Because of the levels at which ethylene oxide and 1,4-dioxaneare present as byproducts in the production of these additives, the agencywould not expect these impurities to become components of food at otherthan extremely small levels; and (2) the upper bound level of lifetimerisk from exposure, even under worst case assumptions, is very low, lessthan 1 in 400 billion for 1,4-dioxane and less than 1 in 8 billion forethylene oxide.H. Conclusion of Safety FDA has evaluated the available toxicity data and the exposure calculationfor the components of the sanitizing solution and has determined that theyare safe and effective for their proposed use. In accordance with andSection; 171.1(h) (21 CFR 171.1(h)), the petition andthe documents that FDA considered and relied upon in reaching its decisionto approve the petition are available for inspection at the Center forFood Safety and Applied Nutrition by appointment with the information contactperson listed above.
