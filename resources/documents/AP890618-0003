(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Pigeon River runs clean and clear for afew miles downstream from its source. But as it snakes through themountains of western North Carolina the stream becomes a foaming,stinking sewer that looks like root beer, smells like rotten eggsand carries a dose of deadly dioxin.   The river's tragic transformation takes place in this little milltown of 4,700 residents.   It was here, 20 miles west of Asheville, that the ChampionInternational Corp. built a paper products plant in 1908. Sincethen, Champion's mill has dumped countless millions of gallons ofdark, poisonous wastewater into the Pigeon River.   For those eight decades, people downstream in Tennessee havecomplained time and time again, to little avail.   If the Tennesseans fear for their health, upriver in NorthCarolina the fear is for 2,000 mill jobs. Now, folks on both sidesof the state line are waiting anxiously as the river's fate is aboutto be decided by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.   ``It's the classic confrontation between jobs and environmentalconcerns,'' says John Marlar, the EPA official in Atlanta who mustmake the initial recommendation. It could come within 30 days.   ``We have received more than 180,000 letters on this matter,'' hesaid. ``It has been a unique case in that there are two statesinvolved and that they have been unable to reach an accommodationwith each other. And, it's very, very rare when we have to step inand take over a state's responsibility to monitor water quality, theway we've had to do in North Carolina.''   The Canton plant, which makes envelope paper and milk cartons,has enormous political clout on its side of the border. It is thebiggest employer in the western end of the state, with a payroll of2,000 workers.   ``Champion has been operating since 1981 without a valid federalwastewater discharge permit,'' Marlar said. ``In 1984 the state ofNorth Carolina issued them a permit, over our objections, and that'swhen we got involved.''   People along the river have complained for decades thatChampion's steaming hot, dark-stained and foul-smelling effluent waswiping out most of the aquatic life for 60 miles downstream, makingthe river unfit for recreation or use as a water supply.   Then, in 1987, the federally sponsored National Dioxin Studyrevealed that the bleaching process used to make milk cartons alsocreates chloroform and dioxin, one of the deadliest poisons.   ``That changed everything,'' Marlar said.   It also created a furor along the Tennessee border, 37 milesdownstream from Canton. The news was especially disturbing inHartford, a riverside hamlet two miles from the state line.   The community, known locally as ``Widowsville,'' has had a rashof cancer deaths over the past 20 years.   ``We're convinced there's a correlation between these deaths andthe river,'' says Charles Lewis Moore, the chief administrativeofficer of Cocke County, Tenn.   He added, ``The EPA has recommended that the river be posted toprevent people from eating the few bottom feeders _ catfish andsuckers, mostly _ that can survive in that muck and mire. But whatabout the people who have lived beside it for all these years?''   Joe Hall is one of those people. The 50-year-old Hall, whooperates a grocery and restaurant at Hartford, said he can'tremember when the river wasn't black and stinking.   ``When we were kids we used to have to hold our noses to keepfrom smelling it when we walked back and forth from school,'' hesaid.   At Newport, 10 miles further downstream, local people formed the``Dead Pigeon River Council'' to fight for a clean river. FranKetterman, one of the founders, had little good to say about eitherthe EPA or Champion.   ``Champion could clean up the river if it really wanted to. Also,we didn't even learn about the dioxin from the EPA. It wasGreenpeace that tipped us off,'' she said.   Fish taken from the river have shown high dioxin levels, shesaid. ``You should see those fish; their bodies are covered withhuge abscesses and tumors, their fins are backwards and their eyesare missing.''   The Pigeon River flows through the center of Newport but thecity's 8,500 residents pipe in their drinking water from the FrenchBroad, six miles away.   Cocke County loses more than $7 million a year in potentialdevelopment and tourism dollars because of the river's pollution,according to studies quoted by Moore.   ``We're counting on the EPA to clean up this mess,'' he said.   Oliver Blackwell, the manager of Champion's Canton plant, saysthere is no hard evidence to bear out allegations about increasedincidence of cancer in Cocke County.   However, he quickly adds: ``I know the people in Tennessee arevery upset and concerned. We haven't done a good job keeping theminformed of all of our many past efforts to clean up our discharge,but we're working on it and I ask them to be patient and to trustus.''   The Tennesseans laugh when told that Blackwell wants their trust.   They say Champion was using economic blackmail when it threatenedto close its Canton plant in late December, after Tennesseeauthorities refused the company's proposal to substantially reducethe color in its discharges. The dark color prevents sunlight fromfiltering through and sustaining aquatic life.   Tennessee's refusal was influenced by Gov. Ned McWherter's canoetrip down the Pigeon River last fall. After spending time on theriver, and after learning that Champion International, the nation'sfifth-largest paper maker, had realized $1.24 billion in profitsover the past 10 years, McWherter declared Tennessee was beingabused by North Carolina.   Tennessee's refusal to accede on the water color issue _ and thecompany's subsequent threat to close the plant _ sent the people ofCanton into a frenzy of fear and anger against the people downstream.   ``We've been wronged by a neighbor,'' complained North CarolinaGov. Jim Martin.   Things got so heated at one point that a North Carolinalegislator proposed that all shipments of Tennessee's strong, brownliquid _ Jack Daniel's whiskey _ be stopped at the border. Coolerheads prevailed.   ``I regret all those angry charges and boycott threats,'' saysBlackwell. ``It's just that the technology currently doesn't existto completely clean up our discharge.''   If ordered to clean up its act completely, he says, the plantwould have to close, thus throwing 2,000 people out of work. Stamey,Canton's city manager, shudders at the prospect of losing the $90million worth of annual wages and benefits generated by Champion.   ``We've got our fingers crossed, waiting to see what the EPA willdo about Champion's water permit,'' Stamey said. ``We really can'tmake any plans for the future until we know the outcome.''   On March 29, the EPA issued a preliminary draft of a compromiseplan that would give Champion three years to install the technologyneeded to significantly reduce the color content and toxicity of itsdischarge.   The EPA's Marlar said he thinks Champion should be required toimmediately begin reducing the amount of dioxin released into theriver, but the exact formula has not been worked out.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
