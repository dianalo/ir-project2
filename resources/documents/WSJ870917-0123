YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD (FED) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Reserve Board proposed rules that would allow bank holding companies to buy healthy savings and loan institutions and operate them as thrifts.    The proposal reflects the changing nature of the thrift industry and regulators' concerns about healthy thrifts leaving the ailing Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. by converting to commercial banks.    Currently, the Fed usually doesn't permit bank holding companies to operate thrifts because of the conflicting regulations for banks and thrifts. When a banking company has purchased a healthy thrift, the Fed has required that the institution be converted to a commercial bank.    Since 1982, however, federal law has allowed bank holding companies to purchase failing thrifts with federal assistance and continue operating them as savings and loan institutions.    Many of the details of the Fed's revised regulation are to be determined after a 60-day period for public comment. For example, the Fed hasn't decided what conditions, if any, it would place on the operations of a bank holding company's thrift subsidiary, including limits on the thrift's joint operations with other subsidiaries of the banking company.    Fed General Counsel Michael Bradfield indicated that federal law would require that the thrift not engage in any activity prohibited to the parent banking company. Thrifts, for example, currently may develop real estate projects, while banks and bank holding companies may not.    Also to be determined is whether any geographical limitations should be applied. Thrifts aren't subject to the same restrictions on interstate operations that are placed upon banks. The Fed could either allow banking companies to buy thrifts in those states where they may purchase banks or allow them to buy thrifts anywhere.    The Fed decided to reconsider its regulations because of the new authorities that Congress and federal and state regulators have given thrifts in recent years. Those changes have &quot;made savings and loans virtually identical to commercial banks except for the signs on the door,&quot; said Fed Gov. Martha Seger.    Another policy consideration is limiting the number of healthy thrifts that leave the FSLIC for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., which charges lower premiums than the FSLIC.    Federal regulators have expressed fears that an exodus of institutions from the thrift insurance fund could threaten its plan to raise as much as $10.8 billion by selling bonds. The bonds are to be financed by the insured institutions. The comprehensive banking bill signed into law last month places a one-year ban on thrifts' leaving the FSLIC.    The thrift industry is split on the Fed's proposal. The influential U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the thrift industry's dominant trade group, opposes it. In a letter to the Fed in July, William O'Connell, president of the organization, said that allowing bank holding companies to acquire healthy thrifts &quot;would gradually diminish the role (thrifts) perform for housing.&quot;    But John Rousselot, president of the smaller National Council of Savings Institutions, which represents more deregulatory-minded thrifts, praised the proposal as &quot;a true recognition on the part of the Fed of reality in the marketplace.&quot; Mr. Rousselot said that by expanding the range of potential buyers for thrifts, the Fed is &quot;moving in the right direction to help the thrift industry.&quot;    The American Bankers Association praised the proposal, but said that thrifts owned by a banking company should have the same authorities as other savings and loans. &quot;We're disappointed that they aren't contemplating allowing the thrifts to enjoy all the advantages they've had up to now,&quot; said Kirk Willison, a spokesman for the group. </TEXT></DOC>
