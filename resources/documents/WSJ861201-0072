The move was seen by banking sources as a setback to Citicorp's efforts to develop its information business.    The venture, Global Electronic Markets Co., or Gemco, was aimed at supplying traders with commodity prices and related data gathered by McGraw-Hill and enabling buyers and sellers to negotiate and settle transactions over the network.    Citicorp attributed the dissolution of the project, which focused on oil and petrochemicals, to the sharp decline in oil prices in the past year. A Citicorp spokesman said curtailments in trading operations at major oil companies and the drop in the dollar volume of oil trading hurt the demand for the service. Gemco had hoped eventually to expand the business to include other commodities, but those plans have been dropped.    &quot;The problem wasn't in the joint venture or partnership,&quot; said Frederick A. Roesch, a Citicorp senior vice president for global electronic markets. &quot;The problem was with the market. We basically concluded there wasn't a critical mass.&quot;    Although Citicorp and McGraw-Hill decided last month to dissolve the partnership, Mr. Roesch said the decision not to market the system occurred several months earlier, following the completion of a six-month test in the offices of about 60 prospective customers.    Meanwhile, McGraw-Hill still supplies oil price information to its customers, Mr. Roesch said. McGraw-Hill officials couldn't be reached for comment over the holiday weekend.    When the project was unveiled in September 1985, it was billed as the first attempt to combine electronically delivered market information with financial services. The network allowed traders to &quot;shake hands&quot; electronically and then complete transactions by arranging such things as letters of credit and foreign exchange contracts. Citicorp chairman John S. Reed said at the time, &quot;We're creating the first global commodities marketplace fulfilling all of the customer's needs.&quot;    For Citicorp, the venture was seen as a significant foray into the information services business, one component of its so-called Five I strategy. This strategy is reflected in the five-way organization of the nation's largest banking company into the individual, or consumer bank; the institutional, or corporate bank; and the investment, insurance, and information banks.    Mr. Roesch denied that the breakup of Gemco dealt a blow to Citicorp's bid to develop its information services. &quot;We figured some ideas would succeed and some wouldn't. We have a number of other products that are doing extremely well,&quot; he said.    Quotron Systems Inc., which Citicorp bought earlier this year for $680 million, is considered the cornerstone of its information services business. Quotron supplies stock price information and other financial data.    Mr. Roesch said most of Gemco's approximately 30 employees originally worked either for Citicorp or McGraw-Hill and have returned to those companies. Although he said Citicorp's investment in Gemco amounted to &quot;several million dollars,&quot; he didn't indicate what impact the abandonment of the venture would have on earnings. </TEXT></DOC>
