The net loss for the quarter ended Dec. 31 compares with year-earlier profit of $2.4 million, or 49 cents a share. The New York-based company said profit from its talent agency group fell because some clients weren't paid until this year for 1987 work. Revenue fell 4.5% to $60.3 million from $63.1 million.    Holders have filed about six suits concerning the proposal by Chairman Marvin Josephson to take the company private in a transaction valued at $33.8 million. A new company formed by Mr. Josephson said in January it would pay $13.50 a share in cash and securities for the 66% of the shares Mr. Josephson doesn't already own.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Josephson shares closed unchanged at $11.75. </TEXT></DOC>
