The star perched atop the partially gutted structure in downtownSofia was hoisted up by the helicopter at 9:30 a.m. to applausefrom some of the 100 people gathered outside. Crews had spent twodays loosening it from the roof.   Torch-carrying youths broke away from a large demonstration nearthe building on Aug. 26, breaking its windows and setting curtainsand furniture inside ablaze. The fire burned for hours before itwas brought under control.
