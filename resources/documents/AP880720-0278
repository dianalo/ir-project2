Gold prices jumped $9 an ounce in Zurich and $8 in London andsilver prices also surged.   Dealers said fears that European central banks again wouldintervene to sell dollars and the belief that the dollar's recentrise was overextended dampened bullish dollar sentiment in themarket.   ``The U.S. trade imbalance is certainly improving, but everyoneknows a rapid rise in the dollar will only break that process,''said a dealer in Milan, Italy.   He predicted the dollar would continue to trade within a narrowrange.   In Tokyo, the dollar fell 0.80 Japanese yen to a closing 133.05yen. Later, in London, it edged up to 133.22 yen.   In London, the British pound rose to $1.7110 from $1.6937 lateTuesday.   Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Tuesday'squotes, included: 1.8475 West German marks, down from 1.8640;1.5320 Swiss francs, down from 1.5475; 6.2325 French francs, downfrom 6.2845; 2.0825 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1010; 1,368.50Italian lire, down from 1,383.60; and 1.1960 Canadian dollars, downfrom 1.2011.   The sudden leap in precious metals prices apparently was sparkedby a combination of a lower dollar and a miner's strike in Peru,they said.
