The Rulemaking</ITAG>The present monitoring requirements for fuel gas combustion devices underandSection; 60.105(a) (3) and (4) allow the options of monitoring SO<T2>2</T2> after fuel gases are combusted or monitoring H<T2>2</T2>S in the fuel gases. Since October 6, 1975 (40 FR 46250), affectedfacilities choosing to monitor H<T2>2</T2>S in the fuel gases have been exempted from the monitoring requirementsof andSection; 60.105(a)(4) because PS's for H<T2>2</T2>S CEMS's had not been established. This rulemaking proposes toamend the emission monitoring requirements to end this exemption. The effectof this rulemaking will be to require affected facilities to monitor SO<T2>2</T2> after fuel gas combustion or, as an alternative, H<T2>2</T2>S in the fuel gas.When fuel gases are burned in a combustion device, the H<T2>2</T2>S is converted to SO<T2>2</T2>. The resulting SO<T2>2</T2> concentration is substantially less than the corresponding H<T2>2</T2>S in the fuel gas due to dilution from added combustion air.The amount of dilution air required for complete fuel gas combustion hingesupon the makeup of fuel gas components (primarily hydrogen and hydrocarbons)and their stochiometric need for oxygen. The EPA investigated a numberof typical fuel gas compositions and their combustion products and determinedthat, at zero percent excess air, the concentration of SO<T2>2</T2> formed from combusting fuel gas containing H<T2>2</T2>S at the standard level (162 ppm) ranged from 9 to 25 ppm withthe majority of values between 15 and 20 ppm. This agrees with the 15-to 20-ppm SO<T2>2</T2> level noted in the Background Document to the proposed petroleumrefineries standard.Realizing the complexity of establishing the SO<T2>2</T2>/H<T2>2</T2>S equivalency on a case-by-case basis, EPA has selected 20 ppmto represent the compliance level for SO<T2>2</T2>. In addition, rather than requiring monitoring of the effluentafter each combustion device, EPA is allowing the monitoring of SO<T2>2</T2> after only one of the combustion devices as long as that onelocation accurately represents the fuel gas being burned by all of thecombustion devices.During 1978 and 1982, EPA conducted evaluations of H<T2>2</T2>S CEMS's and concluded that acceptable H<T2>2</T2>S CEMS's were not available (see Section 4 of PS 7). However,a State agency and a local agency reported that H<T2>2</T2>S CEMS's have been installed under their jurisdiction that areoperating satisfactorily. Certification test reports that have been submittedfor Agency review indicate that, at least in these cases, acceptable CEMSaccuracy and calibration drift are attainable. Other data from regulatoryagencies have shown varying degrees of success in certifying and auditingH<T2>2</T2>S CEMS's. Most of these data were taken from H<T2>2</T2>S CEMS's of the same type, and instrument performance appearsto be linked to operator and maintenance proficiency. Thus, EPA had decidedto allow the use of H<T2>2</T2>S CEMS's for fuel gases as an alternative to SO<T2>2</T2> CEMS's for combusted fuel gases. For this purpose, PS 7 is beingproposed.In reviewing the regulations, EPA determined that the option of controllingSO<T2>2</T2> after combusting the fuel gases was not being used. Also, thisoption does not appear to be an economically feasible alternative for futureconsideration. Therefore, mention of this control option is being deletedfrom the regulation. This action, however, does not prohibit the use ofsuch control devices. In the future, sources that desire to burn fuel gasescontaining H<T2>2</T2>S in excess of 230 mg/dscm and control the resulting SO<T2>2</T2> emissions may petition the Administration for an alternativecompliance demonstration.Hydrogen sulfide and TRS emitted from Claus plants are regulated by standardsset at 10 and 300 ppm, respectively. Total reduced suflur compounds, thoughdetermined separately from TRS, are also inclusive of H<T2>2</T2>S by definition. The Agency has determined that it is difficultto monitor the disproportionate concentrations of H<T2>2</T2>S and TRS on a continual basis, especially at levels near thestandards. A separate determination of H<T2>2</T2>S apart from TRS will therefore not be required, but only thecontinuous monitoring of TRS. Performance Specification 5 and Method 15of 15A are being proposed as the means to evaluate the TRS CEMS performance.For greater flexibility, EPA is also proposing to allow the use of a CEMSthat oxidizes the TRS compounds to SO<T2>2</T2> and analyzes the concentration of the resulting SO<T2>2</T2>. Rather than trying to determine the concentration of SO<T2>2</T2> equivalent to the TRS concentration, EPA is proposing to usethe level of 250 ppm SO<T2>2</T2> (dry basis, zero percent excess air) to represent the SO<T2>2</T2> compliance level. This concentration is consistent with thecontrol option of combusting the effluent gases under andSection; 60.102(a)(2)(i).In addition to the above changes, EPA is proposing to clarify ambiguitiesin the existing regulations by correcting inconsistencies and by specifyingpertinent testing procedures that originally were only implied.This rulemaking does not impose emission measurement requirements beyondthose specified in the current regulations, nor does it change any emissionstandard or make it more stringent. Rather, the rulemaking will facilitatethe use of acceptable CEMS's and allow affected facilities to comply withmonitoring requirements to which they are already subject.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Administrative Requirements</ITAG>A. Public HearingA public hearing will be held, if requested, to discuss the proposed revisionsin accordance with section 307(d)(5) of the Clean Air Act. Persons wishingto make oral presentations should contract EPA at the address given inthe ADDRESSES section of this preamble. Oral presentations will be limitedto 15 minutes each. Any member of the public may file a written statementwith EPA before, during, or within 30 days after the hearing. Written statementsshould be addressed to the Central Docket Section address given in the<T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this preamble.A verbatim transcript of the hearing and written statements will be availablefor public inspection and copying during normal working hours at EPA'sCentral Docket Section in Washington, DC (see <T2>ADDRESSES</T2> section of this preamble).B. DocketThe docket is an organized and complete file of all the information submittedto or otherwise considered by EPA in the development of this proposed rulemaking.The principal purposes of the docket are to: (1) allow interested partiesto identify and locate documents so that they can effectively participatein the rulemaking process, and (2) serve as the record in case of judicialreview (except for interagency review materials) (Section 307(d)(7)(A)).C. Office of Management and Budget ReviewExecutive Order 12291 Review. Under Executive Order 12291, EPA must judgewhether a regulation is ``major'' and, therefore, subject to the requirementof a regulatory impact analysis. This rulemaking would not result in anyof the adverse economic effects set forth in section 1 of the Order asgrounds for finding a ``major rule.'' It will not have an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more, nor will it result in a major increasein costs or prices. There will be no significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofU.S.-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domesticor export markets. This regulation was submitted to the Office of Managementand Budget (OMB) for review as required by Executive Order 12291.D. Regulatory Flexibility Act CompliancePursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I hereby certify that thisattached rule, if promulgated, will not have any economic impact on smallentities because no additional costs will be incurred.This rule does not change any information collection requirements currentlyapproved by OMB under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, 44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq. </T3>Information requirements contained in 40 CFR Part 60,Subpart J are cleared under OMB control number 2060-0022.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 60</ITAG>Air pollution control, Intergovernmental relations, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Incorporation by reference, and Petroleum refineries.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 19, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Don R.

The gases entering the sampling train shouldbe at about atmospheric pressure. If the pressure in the refinery fuelgas lines is relatively high, a flow control valve may be used to reducethe pressure. If the line pressure is high enough to operate the samplingtrain without a vacuum pump, the pump may be eliminated from the samplingtrain. The sample shall be drawn from a point near the centroid of thefuel gas line. The sampling time and sample volume shall be at least 10minutes and 0.010 dscm (0.35 dscf). Two samples of equal sampling timesshall be taken at about 1-hour intervals. The arithmetic average of thesetwo samples shall constitute a run. For most fuel gases, sampling timesexceeding 20 minutes may result in depletion of the collection solution,although fuel gases containing low concentrations of H<T2>2</T2>S may necessitate sampling for longer periods of time.(f) The owner or operator shall determine compliance with the SO<T2>2</T2> and the H<T2>2</T2>S and TRS standards in andSection;60.104(a)(2) as follows:(1) Method 6 shall be used to determine the SO<T2>2</T2> concentration. The concentration is mg/dscm (lb/dscf) obtainedby Method 6 is multiplied by 0.3754 to obtain the concentration in ppm.The sampling point in the duct shall be the centroid of the cross sectionif the cross-sectional area is less than 5.00 m\2\ (54ft\2\) or at a pointno closer to the walls than 1.00 m (39 in.) if the cross-sectional areais 5.00 m\2\ or more and the centroid is more than 1 m from the wall. Thesampling time and sample volume shall be at least 10 minutes and 0.010dscm (0.35 dscf) for each sample. Eight samples of equal sampling timesshall be taken at about 30-minute intervals. The arithmetic average ofthese 8 samples shall constitute a run. Method 4 shall be used to determinethe moisture content of the gases. The sampling point for Method 4 shallbe adjacent to the sampling point for Method 6. The sampling time for eachsample shall be equal to the time it takes for two Method 6 samples. Themoisture content from this sample shall be used to correct the correspondingMethod 6 samples for moisture. For documenting the oxidation efficiencyof the control device for total reduced sulfur compounds, Method 15 shallbe used following the procedures of paragraph (f)(2) of this section.(2) Method 15 shall be used to determine the TRS and H<T2>2</T2>S concentrations. Each run shall consists of 16 samples takenover a minimum of 3 hours. The sampling point shall be the same as thatdescribed for Method 6 in paragraph (f)(1) of this section. The ensureminimum residence time for the sample inside the sample lines, the samplingrate shall be at least 3.0 lpm (0.10 cfm). The SO<T2>2</T2> equivalent for each run shall be calculated after being correctedfor moisture and oxygen as the arithmetic average of the SO<T2>2</T2> equivalent for each sample during the run. Method 4 shall beused to determine the mositure content of the gases as in paragraph (f)(1)of this section. The sampling time for each sample shall be equal to thetime it takes for four Method 15 samples.(3) The oxygen concentration used to correct the emission rate for excessair shall be obtained by the integrated sampling and analysis procedureof Method 3.
