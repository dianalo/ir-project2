The pedestalamplitude technique uses the signal amplitude as a source of informationon drop size. The phase Doppler anemometer (PDA) technique uses an interferometricpattern generated by drops crossing the control volume. The characteristicsof the pattern are used to determine the drop diameter. The experimentalapparatus and the results obtained for both methods are described. Itis concluded that the PDA technique is preferable for spherical particleswith a diameter larger than a few microns, since it gives more accurateresults for the measured sphere diameter. For irregularly shaped particlesor for particles smaller than a few microns, the pedestal technique shouldbe used. 18 references.</TEXT></DOC>
