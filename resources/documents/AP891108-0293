President Bush isexpected to sign the bill next week.   The 89-8 Senate vote came eight days after Bush and congressionalDemocrats agreed on the plan to boost the minimum wage by 45 centsnext April 1 and another 45 cents a year later.   The measure, passed overwhelmingly by the House last week, alsocreates a new, subminimum wage that could be paid to teen-agers fortheir first three months in the work force and up to three monthsmore for those in certified training or education programs.   Bush's signature will not only trigger the first increase in theminimum wage in nearly a decade but also will end a bitter stalematebetween congressional Democrats and successive Republicanadministrations over the politically charged issue.   ``The nine-year logjam on the minimum wage is finally broken,''said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., a key architect of thecompromise. ``The working poor are about to receive an increase,although it is not as much as they deserve.''   Kennedy promised to return to the issue and seek another increaseas the 1992 presidential election nears. Democrats may try to usethe issue against Bush then, but on Wednesday they had praise forthe president.   ``We all owe a debt of gratitude to the president of the UnitedStates, who was willing to stand up and support a minimum wageincrease, thereby reversing the policy of the prior administration,which had consistently opposed any increase,'' said Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell of Maine.   Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah, one of two Republicans whounsuccessfully sought to amend the measure, credited Democrats andKennedy with a victory over the White House in the compromise talks.   ``He's won with the president,'' Hatch said of Kennedy. ``He gotthe president to come his way.''   AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said the labor federation was``delighted that the compromise bill to raise the minimum wage hascleared the Senate and is on its way to the president's desk.America's poorest workers have gone nearly a decade without a raiseand this long overdue step will give them a chance to liftthemselves and their families out of poverty.''   The final vote came afer Hatch and a handful of otherconservative Republicans long opposed to any increase made aspirited rhetorical effort to derail the compromise by defeating oramending it.   ``The fact is that this legislation will not help the people itsays it is supposed to help, those people at the bottom of theeconomic ladder,'' said Sen. Steve Symms, R-Idaho.   But even the Senate's GOP leaders, citing Bush's deal with theDemocrats, frowned on the amendment efforts.   ``The president made an agreement,'' Republican Leader Bob Doleof Kansas said in urging his colleagues not to support amendments.   The minimum wage, frozen at $3.35 an hour since January 1981, ispaid to about 4 million American workers. But the legislation likelywill have a broader impact by driving up the wages of workers whonow make slightly more than the minimum wage, particularly thosecovered by collective bargaining agreements.   Such wage inflation was a major concern of Republicans andbusiness interests who opposed any increase in the minimum wage. ButBush's campaign promise to support one left them hobbled in theirefforts to block a boost, one of organized labor's top prioritiesthroughout the 1980s.   Labor, on the other hand, which failed to win an increase duringthe eight-year Reagan administration and lost in its first fightwith Bush on the issue, was forced to drop its longstandingopposition to any subminimum wage.   Bush in June vetoed a Democratic-backed bill calling for anincrease to $4.55 and, as his veto was sustained, said he would notbudge from his offer of an increase to $4.25 an hour by January 1992provided employers could pay all newly hired workers a subminimumfor up to six months.   The White House, under increasing pressure from GOP lawmakersseeking to avoid another veto battle heading into an election year,two weeks ago signaled a willingness to strike a deal, and bothsides made concessions leading to the compromise.   Bush agreed to a timetable reaching the $4.25 level nine monthsbefore he had proposed and also accepted a far more restrictivetraining wage than he had demanded. The compromise limitsapplication of the subminimum to workers 16-19 years old, requiresactual skills training for it to be paid to those with more thanthree months work experience and prevents it being paid to anyworker with six months total experience. The provision allowing thesubminimum expires in April 1993.   Bush wanted a provision allowing the lower wage to be paid to allworkers, regardless of age, for their first six months on any newjob, regardless of past work experience.   Labor and the Democratic sponsors of the increase, in addition toaccepting the new subminimum, lowered their final target for theincrease _ at one time more than $5 _ to $4.25 an hour. They alsogave up demands for a commission to report annually on whetheradditional boosts were needed. Opponents of any increase feared sucha panel would become a lobbying arm for annual confrontations on theissue.   All eight senators voting againt the measure were Republicans.They were Sens. William Armstrong of Colorado, Hatch and Jake Garnof Utah, Jesse Helms of North Carolina, Gordon Humphrey of NewHampshire, Connie Mack of Florida, Don Nickles of Oklahoma, andSymms of Idaho.</TEXT></DOC>
