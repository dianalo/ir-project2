The Big Three U.S. auto makers cut their U.S. car and truck production by 23% during July, compared with a year ago.    General Motors Corp., Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. built 33% fewer cars in the latest month than a year earlier. The Big Three's share of total U.S. car output fell to 76% in July from 87% a year ago.    The five major Japanese auto makers with U.S. plants boosted their total car and light truck production in July by 50%, to 72,941 vehicles from 48,456 a year earlier.    Meanwhile, auto makers last week expected to build 86,988 cars in the U.S., up 5% from 82,853 cars in the year-ago week. A 29% rise in output from Japanese-owned or joint venture plants offset an expected 1.5% decline in Big Three car output for the week.    GM is expected this week to reopen nine U.S. assembly facilities that had been idled for model changeovers, parts shortages or to cut inventories.    Chrysler said all eight of its U.S. car and truck assembly plants will work this week.    As previously reported, Ford's Atlanta midsized car plant will be idle this week because of a shortage of dealer orders for 1989-model Taurus and Sable cars.    For the year to date, U.S. auto output is down 1% from the year-ago level. Car production by Japanese plants is up 47% for the year through last Friday, while Big Three car output is down 5.4% for the year so far.    ---@ AUTO PRODUCTION MONTHLY @ July July Yr to date Yr to date @U.S. Output 1989 1988 1989 1988 @GENERAL MOTORS @ Cars-b ........ 124,313 176,814 1,976,442 1,983,254 @ Trucks-buses .. 129,722 132,122 993,193 957,999 @ Total ........ 254,035 308,936 2,969,635 2,941,253 @FORD MOTOR @ Cars .......... 64,669 84,609 1,024,330 1,083,866 @ Trucks ........ 53,074 60,537 932,378 890,036 @ Total ........ 117,743 145,146 1,956,708 1,973,902 @CHRYSLER CORP.-c @ Cars .......... 23,343 56,787 545,597 639,312 @ Trucks ........ 23,148 29,575 402,996 367,717 @ Total ........ 46,491 86,362 948,593 1,007,029 @HONDA @ Total ......... 23,452 23,227 221,635 212,616 @NISSAN @ Cars .......... 6,194 5,697 67,880 59,187 @ Trucks ........ 5,404 2,645 70,698 58,667 @ Total ........ 11,598 8,342 138,578 117,854 @TOYOTA @ Total-a ....... 20,115 3,498 120,471 33,952 @MAZDA @ Total ......... 12,262 13,389 130,198 61,123 @DIAMOND STAR @ Total ......... 5,514 32,012 0 -- @INDUSTRY @ Cars .......... 279,862 367,533 4,107,652 4,108,615 @ Truck/bus-x ... 211,348 224,879 2,397,182 2,274,419 @ Total ........ 491,210, 592,412 6,504,834 6,383,034 @ a-Includes Toyota Corolla and Camry cars only. @ b-GM car figures include the Chevrolet Nova built at Nummi. @ c-Includes AMC car and truck production for 1987 and 1986. @ x-Includes only buses and trucks built by auto makers.    ---@ This Last Yr.
