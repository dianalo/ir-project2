Nuclear Regulatory Commission staff members said they weregenerally pleased with the department's plan for determining thesuitability of the site as a permanent graveyard for radioactivewaste from commercial and defense nuclear reactors.   But they raised two crucial objections to the plan and citedseveral less urgent concerns.   Commissioner Kenneth Rogers said he was especially worried thatthe Energy Department was not ensuring that the most critical issuesget settled early.   Among what Rogers described as ``killer issues'' is whether thereare active geologic faults or potentially destabilizing volcanicactivity in the area that would disqualify Yucca Mountain, about 100miles northwest of Las Vegas.   Another is how quickly moisture might dissolve waste and carryradioactive atoms into groundwater supplies.   Rogers said he was concerned that once construction gained acertain momentum, ``a really fundamental question somehow gets lostin the dust.''   Initial construction work is scheduled to start in November, andthe Energy Department is to decide by 1994 whether the site issuitable. If the NRC granted a license, wastes would start movinginto the site in 2003.   Robert Bernero, commission director of nuclear materials safetyand safeguards, said in an interview that Energy Secretary James D.Watkins was reconsidering that timetable as part of a ``fresh look''at the entire program.   The Nevada government is strongly opposed to the program. Gov.Bob Miller recently signed a bill making it illegal for anygovernment body to store high-level radioactive waste in the state.   Bernero said the NRC had concluded that the Energy Department hadproduced a ``fundamentally useable'' plan for collecting andanalyzing the data necessary to decide whether Yucca Mountain was asuitable site.   He said the staff had two key objections to the plan: It didn'tinclude an adequate means of assuring the quality of the datacollected and there may be flaws in the design of an experimentalshaft to be drilled on the site.   In a related development, the Energy Department ordered SandiaNational Laboratories, one of the major contractors on the project,to stop work until it corrected a technical flaw in itsquality-control program.   Meanwhile, Sen. John Glenn, D-Ohio, introduced legislation togive states authority over cleanup of hazardous wastes from thedepartment's nuclear weapons plants without going to court. The billwould demand a concrete cleanup schedule whenever government weaponsplants are closed.   The bill was aimed at Ohio's Fernald uranium-processing plant andradioactive wastes at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant.   Glenn also proposed increasing the power of the Defense NuclearSafety Board, protecting the Energy Department's Office ofEnvironmental Safety and Health from future administrativereorganizations and repealing a provision preventing the EnergyDepartment from paying environmental penalties.</TEXT></DOC>
