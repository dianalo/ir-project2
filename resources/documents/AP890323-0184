Those who operate the semi-private cooperatives must choosebetween knuckling under or fighting back, the Communist Partynewspaper said. It quoted a police chief as saying: ``The populationis arming itself.''   ``People are making guns and bombs right at work,'' said thechief, who was not identified. ``And you know how they explain it?Self-defense.''   The Interior Ministry acknowledges that new economicopportunities and social change introduced by President Mikhail S.Gorbachev have brought more crime.   Pravda said the murder rate rose 14 percent last year and armedrobberies increased by more than 40 percent. Professional criminalsare multiplying in a ``renaissance of robber traditions,'' andorganized crime benefits from the new atmosphere, it said.   The newspaper attributed almost 20,000 crimes in 1987-88 to 2,607organized groups, of which 50 acted in ``deep conspiracy'' for morethan three years.   Gangs have souped-up cars, computers, bugging devices and hiddenvideo cameras at their disposal, while police work with outdatedequipment and insufficient enthusiasm, the article said.   Many cooperatives hire policemen away from the force to serve asguards, Pravda declared, sometimes tripling their pay and providingup to 34 vacation days a year.   Organized crime also causes increased corruption in the justicesystem, the party paper said.   ``Underground millionaires and policemen, robbers andprosecutors, judges and speculators, party workers and `godfathers'often end up in the same boat together'' at conviction time, it said.   Pravda criticized the revised criminal code now underconsideration. Although the new code would humanize the system, thepaper said, it would benefit criminals at the expense of theirvictims.   Changes in the code would provide more alternatives to prisonsentences, such as house arrest and community service, and reducethe number of capital crimes.   According to the Pravda report, police would not have a way toarrest leaders of organized crime rather than those who merelyfollow orders.   It quoted a detective named Y. Myslovsky as saying ``our heartssank'' when he and other investigators learned of the new provisions.   Cooperatives are open to extortion because framers of currentlaws never dreamed enterprises in a communist state would produceenough profit to make the protection racket worthwhile.   Although police have formed anti-racketeering units and the lawis being revised, ``while you're all discussing new legislationaround here, I'm buying a gun,'' Pravda quoted a cooperative workeras saying. ``The racketeers have driven me crazy, and the policewon't defend me,'' he said.   Gorbachev introduced cooperatives to spur individual enterpriseand help fill gaps in poor state-run services and production ofconsumer goods. Their prices are not set by the state, and manycooperatives sell scarce items for high profits on which taxes arecomparatively low.   They are praised for initiative but sometimes censured for buyingup goods meant for the general public. Cooperatives also have beenaccused of developing their own rackets and bribing officials to getpermits and supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
