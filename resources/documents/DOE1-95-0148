Principal free amino acids wereasparagine, aspartic acid, glutamic acid, serine, and glutamine. Percentaspartate and glutamate declined as the ovaries grew, with aspartatedeclining more in abscising and glutamate more in setting ovaries. Percentglutamate was positively correlated to percent abscission throughoutthe period. Proline, serine, and leucine were positively correlated toabscission from 0 to 2 days after anthesis, whereas significant negativecorrelations were observed at these ages for ethanolamine and arginine.{sup 75}Se fed as selenate and {sup 14}C fed as sucrose, glycine, andalanine were readily incorporated into soluble and insoluble proteinsin a 24-hour in vitro incubation. Radioactivity of total proteins, expressedon a per-ovary basis, was negatively correlated with percent abscissionand positively correlated with ovary weight. [{sup 14}C]Glutamine andserine followed the opposite pattern, with greater protein labeling inabscising than in setting ovaries. When data were expressed as disintegrationsper minute per milligram ovary fresh weight, protein labeling from alaninewas seen to be significantly greater in abscising ovaries at anthesisand throughout the sampling period. Nucleic acid labeling from uridinewas highly correlated to ovary weight; labeling from thymidine was greaterin setting than abscising ovaries at anthesis and in abscising ovariesat later stages of development.</TEXT></DOC>
