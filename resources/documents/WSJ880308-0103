A year earlier, the Fremont, Calif.-based company earned $15.2 million, or 67 cents a share, on sales of $132.8 million.    Worlds of Wonder attributed the loss to plummeting sales and delays in getting its toys to market during the Christmas season. The quarter's loss included a charge of $63.6 million for reserves to cover price reductions, estimated losses for the liquidation of a Hong Kong unit and disposal of excess materials related to discontinued or slow-moving lines. In addition, the company was hurt by high advertising costs.    For the nine months, the once high-flying toy-maker, now operating under the protection of Chapter 11 of federal bankruptcy laws, had a net loss of $182.7 million on sales of $109.7 million. In the year-earlier period, the company had profit of $18 million, or 83 cents a share, on sales of $218 million.    The company said it had a negative net worth, or excess of liabilities over assets, of nearly $83.7 million at the end of its third quarter. As a result, the company's subordinated debt holders and trade creditors will take large losses on the $202 million they are owed. The company also owes $78 million to five banks led by First National Bank of Chicago, a unit of First Chicago Corp.    Gary Jacobson, an analyst with Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co., said, &quot;I was expecting it to be bad, but this is bad.&quot; Mr. Jacobson said he had estimated the company would post a loss of about $100 million for the quarter. Fred Anschel, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. said the loss is &quot;larger than anything I had imagined.&quot;    As previously reported, an Ernst andamp; Whinney accountant representing Worlds of Wonder's secured creditors estimated in bankruptcy court in January the company would post a loss of as much as $180 million for a 10-month period through January.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Worlds of Wonder shares fell 25 cents to close at $1.125.    Worlds of Wonder, founded in 1985, racked up huge sales with its hits Teddy Ruxpin and Lazer Tag, the top toys for two consecutive Christmas seasons. But last year, plagued by production problems and delays, the company faltered. In December, the company filed for protection under Chapter 11.    In Chapter 11, a company is protected from creditors' lawsuits while it works out a plan to pay debt.    Last year wasn't a good one for the toy industry. Mattel Inc. had a $100.7 million loss for the fourth quarter, ended Dec. 26, and a loss of $113.2 million for the year. For the first nine months of 1987, Coleco Industries Inc. had a loss of $6.6 million.    Still, Worlds of Wonder's loss ranks with the industry's largest. For the 1984 fiscal year, Mattel had a loss of $394 million. In 1986, Coleco had a loss of $111.2 million. In 1983, computer and video game maker Atari Inc., then owned by Warner Communications Inc., had a loss of $538.6 million. Donald Kingsborough, chairman of Worlds of Wonder, was a senior sales executive at Atari at that time.    Despite its bleak financial situation, Worlds of Wonder attended last month's Toy Fair in New York, wooing buyers at the ballroom of the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Worlds of Wonder introduced low-priced toys, including a variation on a jump rope and a water baseball game. The company said the products have received a &quot;good response&quot; from buyers.    Mr. Jacobson, who attended the event, said: &quot;I laughed all the way through. Kingsborough really doesn't know when to give up. . . . The company is gone.&quot; He said other toy companies that have posted huge losses &quot;still have a stable base of products,&quot; including standards such as games, puzzles or Barbie. &quot;None of WOW's products have staying power,&quot; he said.    Mr. Anschel, who also attended, was slightly more optimistic. He said the company had &quot;a couple of decent items&quot; and thought its &quot;chances to survive have improved somewhat.&quot; He said the company's future depends on how it intends to raise working capital and on its reorganization plan.    Paul Jakab, the company's general counsel, said Worlds of Wonder had a negative net worth, or excess of liabilities over assets, of $83.7 million at the end of its third quarter. He said the company is scheduled to present its plan of reorganization on April 19, although that deadline can be extended.    He said the company was &quot;pleased with the favorable response&quot; Worlds of Wonder received at the Toy Fair. He said he couldn't be specific about any orders placed by retailers. &quot;The intention of the company is to go forward in a very positive manner. We wanted to put the bad news behind us. People here are very dedicated to make this thing go.&quot;    Worlds of Wonder is being financed through an interim agreement approved by the bankruptcy court, which covers the company's costs through March 18. Another hearing on the financing is scheduled for later this month. </TEXT></DOC>
