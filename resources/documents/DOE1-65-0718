In a sense the term low energy superstrings is misleading:the work of the past fifteen years in string theory, culminating in lastsummer's stunning developments by Green and Schwartz have led theoriststo believe a finite, consistent superstring theory can be formulated.An enormous amount of work is going on in this subject, the premise thatan effective field theory in ten space-time dimensions can be obtainedfrom the superstring theory is the start of the lectures. The lectureswill cover this later stage, namely how does one proceed from the effectiveten dimensional theory to an effective four dimensional theory, describingthe world as we see it. 87 references, 2 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
