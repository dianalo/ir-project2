But such a combination isn't likely to occur soon -- and that appears to be good news both for Japan's European and U.S. competitors and for Southeast Asian nations currently enjoying an economic boom because of Japanese investment.    Beginning tomorrow, 170 Japanese business leaders will hold four days of economic cooperation meetings with Soviet officials in Moscow. Considering the current East-West thaw, it would be natural to assume this will be one of the most productive of the 12 such meetings the two nations have held since 1966.    It also would be wrong. Japanese businessmen expect little to come of the talks. Soviet trade officials here decline to comment, but it isn't thought that the U.S.S.R. expects much from the talks, either. More than ever, two big obstacles -- one political, the other economic -- appear to block increased Japanese trade with and investment in the Soviet Union.    Despite wider diplomatic contacts, no progress has been made in resolving claims to four islands north of Japan that the Soviet Union occupied in the waning days of World War II. The more the two sides talk about the issue, the more entrenched their positions seem to become.    A Foreign Ministry official has been urging Japanese business leaders not to proceed with any major projects until the Soviets make a major concession on the territorial issues, according to trade association officials. It would be undesirable, says one government official, to allow the Soviets &quot;to take only the delicious part&quot; and get sweet deals without swallowing some bitter political concessions.    But even if the dispute were resolved, it isn't clear that Japanese companies would find it profitable to jump into Siberia. That's a big change from the outlook a decade ago, when the economic interests of the two nations seemed to be converging perfectly. The Soviet Union had enormous reserves of untapped natural resources in Siberia, just a short boat ride from Japan. And Japan had an insatiable appetite for natural resources, but none of its own. The world in those days seemed resource-starved.    The world looks different now, as do oil prices. Of the more than 400 Soviet-foreign joint ventures undertaken since the Soviet Union began promoting such ventures in 1987, only 12 have been with Japan. Less than 2% of Japan's trade is with the U.S.S.R.    A Sakhalin Island natural gas and oil project has been under discussion for more than 10 years, but &quot;given the current oil price level, any investments we might make wouldn't pay,&quot; says Kazuo Ogawa, managing director of Japan Association for Trade with Soviet Union and Socialist Countries of Europe.    Even if energy prices were to rise, Siberia might not be Japan's most attractive alternative source of supply. &quot;Why do Japanese companies have to choose the Soviet Far East?&quot; asks a government official. &quot;There is no infrastructure and the climate is also very severe. Southeast Asia is available {for investments}. Unless the Soviet side provides incentives, no way.&quot;    To be sure, economic contact between the two nations is far from drying up. Trade between the two reached an all-time high last year, surpassing the record set in 1982, with combined value of exports and imports totaling $5.9 billion. But trade association officials attribute the rise largely to price increases.    Japanese industry sources also complain about dealing with the labyrinthine Soviet bureaucracy. Soviet attempts at economic reform have meant a constant reshuffling of government bureaus and the officials responsible for them, making it difficult for Japanese companies to locate the right person when they do want to negotiate possible deals.    However, Ryoichi Kawai, chairman of Komatsu Ltd., the big maker of construction machinery, told Kyodo News Service that he is particularly looking forward to meeting this week with representatives of Soviet enterprises, which will be a first. Mr. Kawai, who is also vice chairman of the Japan-Soviet Business Cooperation Committee, said he expects progress in talks on the development of energy, paper pulp, and coal, Kyodo reported.    Japanese businessmen also doubt that joint-venture companies in the Soviet Union can make export-quality products. The Soviets are believed to be targeting the products of ventures at its domestic market, but that solution raises another problem: The lack of convertibility of the ruble, which prevents Japanese companies from repatriating any profits.    To set up plants in the Soviet Union capable of producing export-quality products, Japanese companies would have to bring in up-to-date facilities with them. But that could bring Japanese companies up against Cocom regulations against high-technology exports to East bloc nations. Cocom, the Coordinating Committee for Multilateral Export Controls, is a group of 16 industrial nations that sets common policies to control exports to Communist countries. Japanese companies have been fearful of offending the U.S. over Cocom since the 1987 incident in which a Toshiba Corp. subsidiary was disclosed to be in violation of the rules -- a disclosure that led to the subsidiary being shut out of the U.S. market and the resignation of the parent's two top officials.    For most major Japanese companies, trade with the Soviet Union isn't worth the risks incurred in other markets, particularly the U.S., trade association officials say. The U.S. accounts for 29% of Japan's total exports and imports, compared with only 1.3% for the Soviet Union.    Some Japanese businessmen worry that unless their nation strengthens economic relations with the Soviets, European, U.S. and South Korean companies might displace it. West Germany, for example, recently concluded an investment-protection agreement with the Soviets.    But in the absence of an easing of Cocom rules, progress is unlikely at this week's meeting except, possibly, on a Siberian forest-resource development project. And even that won't be easy, industry and association officials say, because the Soviet Union is pushing to export furniture and lumber instead of logs for higher added value. Japanese businessmen doubt that this furniture will do well with Japan's style-conscious consumers. </TEXT></DOC>
