<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-0647 </DOCNO><TEXT>The effects of charge-symmetry breaking on the two nucleon system arediscussed. Two specific reactions are considered in detail: np elasticscattering and np {yields} d{pi}{sup 0}, with some emphasis on the former.In np elastic scattering these effects have been calculated in termsof electromagnetic interactions and one-boson exchange (with other contributionsestimated to be small), and are in reasonable agreement with the oneexisting measurement from TRIUMF. Calculations for np {yields} d{pi}{sup0} are more difficult, but predict effects close to current experimentallimits. 15 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
