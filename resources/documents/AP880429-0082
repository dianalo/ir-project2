The dispatch from Havana, received here, said Cuban DeputyForeign Minister Raul Roa Kouri had used the figure of 458``counterrevolutionary prisoners'' during the meeting in Geneva,Switzerland.   The U.N. Human Rights Commission addressed the situation in Cubaduring a six-week session that ended March 11.   Prensa Latina said the attorney general was asked if penal codereforms scheduled to take effect April 30 would benefit prisonersbeing held for crimes against state security.   ``The policy that is followed with them is different,'' de laCruz was quoted as replying. ``It obeys a program that relatesrelease with emigration to the United States.''   He noted that an agreement has been made on that subject withRoman Catholic bishops of the United States.   New York Cardinal John O'Connor said last week on a visit toHavana that Cuban President Fidel Castro indicated that hundreds ofpolitical prisoners could be freed from Cuban jails if the UnitedStates gave them visas.   During the meeting in Switzerland, the U.N. Human RightsCommission accepted Castro's invitation to send its firstdelegation to Cuba to investigate allegations of human rightsabuses.   Cuba denies allegations from the United States, AmnestyInternational and others of torture and mistreatment of politicalprisoners.   De la Cruz also said in the interview that the death penaltyremains in force in the new code.   He said, however, that all legal actions take place in Cubawithin the law. ``We never have used nor will we use, as happens insome Latin American countries, disappearances, illegalexecutions,'' the attorney general said.</TEXT></DOC>
