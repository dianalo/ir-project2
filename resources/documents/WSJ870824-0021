YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> GRAND TETON NATIONAL PARK, Wyo.  </DATELINE><TEXT>    The chairman of theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp. proposed a sweeping plan toderegulate financial services.   William Seidman called for the repeal of the legal barriers prohibiting banks from securities underwriting and other types of businesses. At the same time, federal regulators should increase their supervision of banks and their dealings with their affiliates in order to guard against improper transactions under a new financial services system, Mr. Seidman said.    The plan is one of the most far-reaching blueprints for deregulating financial services to be put forward by a federal policy maker, but faces substantial hurdles to enactment. It is contained in a 184-page draft FDIC study that Mr. Seidman unveiled here to a symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Mo.    Mr. Seidman's proposal goes well beyond those offered by bank trade groups and by Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, all of which favor maintaining the separation of banking and commerce.    Mr. Seidman said his goals are to simplify banking regulation and &quot;enhance the safety and soundness (of the banking industry) by making banks an attractive place to put capital.&quot; What is needed, he said, is &quot;a system that keeps banks safe . . . but lets the marketplace around them operate with freedom from bank regulators.&quot;    Under the plan, banks could own or be owned by companies that engage in non-banking business. Federal law currently prohibits banks from ooow banks from owningggks from owning or bbom owning or being owned by a company that isn't related to banking, and bans most banks from being affiliated with securities firms.    Those barriers, some more than a half-century old, stem from the belief that conflicts of interest in the 1920s -- arising from commericial banks' domination of the securities field -- helped trigger the Depression.    Mr. busecan be solved with stronger supervision of banks by federalregulators. He called current laws &quot;inefficient andunnecessary.&quot;   In addition, Mr. Seidman proposed removing the non-bank parts of banking companies from regulation by any of the federal banking agencies. Currently, the Federal Reserve Board oversees the activities of bank holding companies and their subsidiaries.    Mr. Seidman said the changes should be adopted over a period of two to three years. &quot;I don't think I would advocate racing down that road yet,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think you can move all at once, either politically or practically.&quot;    Congress is moving on financial-services reform almost as slowly as the glaciers that shaped the peaks of the Teton mountain range here long ago. The banking bill that President Reagan signed into law two weeks ago prohibits regulators from giving banking companies new authority to deal in securities, real estate or insurance until March 1, 1988.    Lawmakers wanted the moratoriumin order to have more time to consider whether banks should have expanded powers. But Congress isn't expected to settle the issue by the time the moratorium ends.    Mr. Seidman acknowledged that his plan is controversial, noting that a large &quot;amount of agency and special-interest turf could be torn up.&quot; The powerful lobbies for the securities, real estate and insurance industries, for example, have strenuously fought any attempt to allow banks into their fields. In addition, the role of the Fed in regulating banking companies could be greatly diminished.    Many of those attending the Kansas City Fed's symposium questioned whether Mr. Seidman's plan was feasible.    Some doubted that any amount of supervision by regulators could prevent improper transactions between a bank and its commercial affiliate. Addressing that issue in general, Steven Roberts, a principal for Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co. who was an assistant to former Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, said, &quot;I'm not sure that that heavy burden can be carried out by field examiners.&quot;    Carter Golembe, a Washington-based banking consultant, praised Mr. Seidman's proposal as &quot;simpler and cleaner&quot; than other plans and &quot;breathtaking in its audaciousness.&quot; But, Mr. Golembe said, &quot;I'm not sure where his allies are.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
