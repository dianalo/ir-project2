The National Association of Broadcasters, along with majoradvertising industry groups and alcoholic beverage makers, onTuesday said recommendations by a U.S. Surgeon General's workshopthat restrictions be placed on alcohol ads were a well-meaning butconstitutionally unsupportable attack on commercial speech.   Wallace S. Snyder of the American Advertising Federation said theworkshop recommendations ``are clearly unconstitutional anddiscriminatory because of a lack of evidence showing any linkbetween alcoholic beverage advertising and consumption, let aloneabuse.''   ``We're really concerned that censorship of truthful advertisingis contagious, and we would be on a slippery slope, and all sorts ofproduct advertising would come under fire,'' Snyder said.   Restricting ads does not get at the root causes of drunkenness _a problem that must be approached by expanded public education, thegroups said.   At a news conference, industry representatives attacked therecommendations presented to Surgeon General C. Everett Koop inDecember by a workshop on drunken driving. The broadcasters andadvertisers said they were writing to Koop to urge him, as oneofficial put it, to reject ``these hasty and misguided proposals.''   The NAB and the advertising industry declined to participate inthe workshop last year, claiming it was stacked against advertisers'interests.   Advertising of alcoholic beverages on radio and televisiontotaled $931 million in 1987, the NAB said. The industryrepresentatives Tuesday said they stood ready to increase theircampaigns against alcohol abuse.   Snyder said he hoped Koop would recognize the anti-drunkennessefforts being made by the advertising industry and ``not to get intoa confrontational mode but to try to solve this problem by talking.''   ``Banning alcohol advertising and marketing will have no effecton the drunk driving problem other than to provide falsesatisfaction that something is being done,'' NAB President Edward O.Fritts said in a statement.   ``Research shows that the first step toward solving the tragedyof drunk driving is to make drunkenness socially unacceptable,''Fritts said. ``Attempts to scapegoat any one element of society arecounterproductive and, in the workshop's case, totally withoutmerit.''   However, the presidential National Commission Against DrunkDriving reported in December that teen-agers testified during publichearings ``with near unanimity'' that advertising encouragesadolescents to drink. The commission said drunken driving was theNo. 1 killer of teens.   The federal Centers for Disease Control said 23,632 people werekilled in the United States in 1987 in vehicular accidents in whichalcohol was involved.   The workshop's recommendations to Koop included banning alcoholads and promotion and sponsorship of public events where themajority of the audience is under the legal drinking age;elimination of advertising that portrays activities that arecombined with alcohol use; banning sponsorship of athletic events bythe alcoholic beverage industry; and blocking the use of celebritieswho have a strong appeal to young people in alcohol advertising andpromotion.   NAB representative Chuck Sherman said the NAB had recommended toKoop that:   _Broadcasting's ongoing public service announcements campaign``should be broadened and developed to make the public aware thatgetting drunk is socially unacceptable.''   _An education campaign should be developed to explain thedifference between taking a drink and getting drunk.   _Individuals ``can and should be trained and educated torecognize an impending intoxication in others _ and trained tointervene effectively.''   _``Families must be taught that education about drinkingpractices begins at home.''   _Incentives should be promoted to encourage anti-drunkennessefforts.   Jim Brown, a spokesman for the Public Health Service, said Koopwould have no immediate comment on the comments by the broadcastersand advertisers. He said Koop would review the panel'srecommendations and public comments and then issue his own views.</TEXT></DOC>
