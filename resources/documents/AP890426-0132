JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Environmental groups and six states called onthe Interior Department on Wednesday to strengthen regulationsbeing used as guides in estimating damage to natural resources fromthe Alaska oil spill.   The present regulations, which Interior officials have confirmedare being used in negotiations with Exxon Corp., already are thesubject of a lawsuit claiming they are too lax on polluters andprevent adequate compensation for major oil or toxic chemicalspills.   The regulations place ``an absurdly low value on wildlife andother resources,'' maintained Joan Claybrook, president of PublicCitizen, an advocacy group which is among those who have challengedthe regulations in court.   The critics asked in a letter to Interior Secretary Manuel Lujanthat the regulations be rewritten so that more than ``marketvalue'' of destroyed resources is used in assessing recovery costsin a long-term settlement on damages caused by the Alaska spill.   In addition to Ms. Claybrook, the authors of the letter includedthe attorneys general of Ohio, Colorado, Maine, Texas, Rhode Islandand Connecticut. The regulations also have been criticized by theNational Wildlife Federation and officials of a number of otherstates as being too easy on polluters.   Interior Department officials acknowledged in interviews Tuesdaythat the government has agreed to use guidelines giving pollutersthe option of paying only the ``market value'' of resources theydestroy, rather than the cost of restoring the environment to itspre-spill condition if the market value is cheaper.   The decision comes despite administration promises to seek``complete restoration'' of losses from the Exxon Valdez tankerspill that has fouled Alaska's wildlife-rich Prince William Sound.   The regulations in question stem from the 1980 Superfund lawwhich required Interior to establish guidelines on assessing damageresulting from an oil spill or discharge of toxic chemicals.   The regulations were supposed to make it easier for states andfederal trustees of public lands to recover damages. But Interiortook nearly six years to draw them up and, according to critics,did so in 1986 substantially along the lines sought by the oilindustry.   ``The rules are there, they make sense and we're going to startto use them,'' said Cecil Hoffman, a senior Interior officialinvolved with the damage assessment effort. ``The intent is thatwe're going to set a dollar value'' on the damages.   Ms. Hoffman said, however, that the regulations are viewed as aframework for making the assessments and do not necessarilypreclude other actions being taken.   The rules, however, are under challenge in the federal courts.Three environmental groups and 10 states have filed suit accusingInterior of violating the Superfund law by making the regulationstoo lax.   In February, six weeks before the Exxon spill, the JusticeDepartment vigorously defended the regulations at a hearing beforethe U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington. No decision has yet beenmade by the court.   ``The rules create a myriad of ... economic, scientific andadministrative obstacles to the recovery of funds needed to restoredamaged resources,'' maintains Eric Glitzenstein, an attorney forPublic Citizen.   Erik Olson, an lawyer for the National Wildlife Federation,another plaintiff in the suit, said if the damage assessments aredetermined under Interior's regulatory guidelines, Exxon could wellescape substantial liability.   During the recent court hearing, Justice Department attorneysdefended the reliance on ``use value'' and ``market value'' todetermine damages on natural resources. Lawyers for theenvironmental groups and states argued that total cost of``restoration and replacement'' should be required.   Under some guidelines, the value of a seal might be as little as$15 because that has been determined as the value of its pelt,while a seabird such as the puffin might be merely $7.88, theenvironmental lawyers said.   Other plaintiffs in the suit which was filed last year are theEnvironmental Defense Fund and the states of New York, New Jersey,Ohio, California, Connecticut, Colorado, Massachusetts, Maine,Rhode Island and Vermont.</TEXT></DOC>
