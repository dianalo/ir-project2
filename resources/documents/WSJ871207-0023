Analysts say that change is bound to come but that it will probably come very slowly.    A Ministry of Finance advisory committee Friday issued a report calling for a complete review of the country's financial system, including barriers that divide banking and the securities industry. The report lends official muscle to demands by various sectors of the financial industry for access to one another's business.    But immediate change is unlikely because the report doesn't propose specific ways to untangle the rival demands of vested interests, industry sources and ministry officials say. &quot;For the future, the report is undoubtedly significant,&quot; says Simon Smithson, research manager at the Tokyo branch of Kleinwort Benson International Inc., a British securities firm. &quot;How near-term a future we're talking about is another thing.&quot;    In its report, the Financial Systems Research Council said financial deregulation is needed for integrating Japanese and international markets. The council said the report should act as a guideline for dismantling laws that limit banks' activities and that put a wall between the banking and securities sectors.    &quot;The report is very important because it will stimulate discussion immediately,&quot; says an official at Nomura Securities Co. &quot;The discussion is the most important first step.&quot;    The potential changes the report might bring about include:    --Enabling all banks to engage in the management of Japan's huge pension funds, an area now restricted to the country's nine trust banks.    --Allowing city banks -- the major commercial banks -- to participate in long-term lending, which currently is officially confined to long-term credit banks.    --Allowing banks to engage in securities dealing and underwriting, breaking down one of the strictest barriers in place. The advisory committee's report suggests using the Canadian system as a model for allowing banks to enter the securities business through affiliated companies.    Since the end of World War II, Japan has strictly separated the securities business from banking to prevent the development of financial monopolies with too much power over industry.    Similar legislation in the U.S., the Glass-Steagall Act, is being reviewed by Congress. Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman, last week endorsed a bill proposing that banks be allowed to enter securities dealing and underwriting through subsidiaries of their holding companies. U.S. deregulation would provide an impetus to efforts in Japan, industry analysts say.    Britain last year became a testing ground of financial deregulation when it ended 85 years of fixed commissions and the separation of financial powers in October's so-called Big Bang.    In Japan, pressure to loosen restrictions has grown as banks and securities firms increasingly overlap in new markets. Most recently, they have been allowed for the first time to compete directly with each other in a commercial-paper market that opened last month. The legal restriction against banks participating in securities was sidestepped by defining the commercial paper as promissory notes.    Also last month, another advisory-committee report called for the creation of a comprehensive futures market that would be open to both banks and securities houses.    Foreign banks don't expect to be much affected by changes in the financial system, at least not quickly. Those already in Japan enjoy some securities business because they alone are allowed to own 50% of a Tokyo securities branch. Such arrangements could be taken as a starting point for the deregulation of Japanese banks, analysts say.    &quot;Breaking down compartments between various banks has to happen; it's only a matter of time,&quot; says Robert Binney, Tokyo-based senior vice president with Chase Manhattan Bank.    But carrying out the deregulation will require hard negotiations. &quot;The problems are complicated,&quot; says a Finance Ministry official. &quot;Deep discussion will be needed to settle them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
