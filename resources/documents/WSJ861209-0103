In July 1985 a narrowly divided (8-7) Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the statute violates the establishment clause of the First Amendment because it &quot;would have the effect of promoting religion&quot; -- hardly what the framers had in mind when they proscribed religious establishment.    The Louisiana law makes no reference to any specific religious doctrine (such as the Flood). The appeals court majority noted that &quot;the theory of creation is a theory embraced by many religions,&quot; thereby (one would have thought) minimizing the likelihood that the statute would tend to favor any one religion. The appeals court objected that &quot;the scheme of the statute, focusing on the bete noire of evolution as it does, demonstrates the religious purpose of the statute.&quot; Thus &quot;self-serving statements&quot; as to its secular intent made in legislative hearings could safely be ignored.    In an amusing dissent joined in by almost half the court, Circuit Judge Thomas Gibbs Gee wrote: &quot;I await with interest the application of this new mode of constitutional analysis to other statutes. The bigamy laws, for example, carry tell-tale indicia of having been passed with a motive to favor the Judeo-Christian preference for monogamy. . . . Perhaps our court, consulting its intuitive knowledge about what motivates legislators, will presently determine that there can be no secular purpose in such a preferment of one model of the marital relationship over another.&quot;    Still, one has qualms about the Louisiana law -- or any other law that tells schools what they must teach. Having failed to score the necessary intellectual victory, creationists are attempting a forced entry into the academic citadel with, as it were, police escort. If successful, this will only provoke greater intellectual resistance to their ideas in the future.    The problem stems, I believe, from an unwarranted dogmatism about evolution that is pervasive in the biology profession. This, in turn, has driven parents and (no doubt about it) religious groups to pressure legislators into providing a legal remedy. The Arkansas Legislature acted first, but its equal-time law was effectively laughed out of court with much guffawing about fundamentalists and rednecks, and endless jocular references to the Scopes trial.    We are repeatedly told that evolution is &quot;not a theory but a fact.&quot; This is little more than whistling in the dark. There has been a persistent campaign by evolutionists to bully the lay public into accepting evolution by adopting an authoritarian posture inappropriate to science. The fact is that we know very little about evolution -- far less than most educated people realize.    Colin Patterson, a senior paleontologist at the British Museum of Natural History, remarked at a public lecture in New York in 1981 that there was &quot;not one thing&quot; that he knew about evolution. &quot;Question is,&quot; he went on, &quot;can you tell me anything you know about evolution, any one thing that is true? I tried that question on the geology staff of the Field Museum of Natural History and the only answer I got was silence.&quot;    I so quoted him in a Harper's magazine article in February 1985, and Mr. Patterson seems not to have recanted the heresy. In a recent issue of the Creation/Evolution Newsletter, he writes: &quot;The awful question: 'can you tell me anything you know about evolution . . .' Well, I still think it's a reasonable one.&quot;    In the Louisiana case Dean Kenyon, a professor of biology at San Francisco State University, has submitted an affidavit in which he attests to his belief &quot;that a scientifically sound creationist view of origins is not only possible, but is to be preferred over the evolutionary view.&quot;    Mr. Kenyon, who has a doctorate in biophysics from Stanford University, is the author of a 1969 book, &quot;Biochemical Predestination.&quot; He taught undergraduate courses on evolution and the Darwinian revolution to undergraduates at San Francisco State, but he was reassigned apparently when he began to raise questions about the subject.    Another professor who has raised questions about evolution is G. Lawrence Vankin of Williams College, in Massachusetts. According to Mr. Vankin, after he assigned to his students two articles from the prestigious Journal of Theoretical Biology that questioned the plausibility of evolution by random processes, the Williams biology department told the library to cancel its subscription to the journal. Mr. Vankin was subsequently reassigned to the college's history of science department.    In conversations with me, more than one professional staff member at the American Museum of Natural History in New York has expressed frustration at the dogmatism and authoritarianism that saturate evolutionary biology. One day Gareth Nelson, the chairman of the ichthyology department at the museum, characterized the typical paleontologist's search for ancestral species in the rocks as follows: &quot;'We've got to have some ancestors. We'll pick those.' 'Why?' 'Because we know they have to be there, and these are the best candidates.' That's by and large the way it has worked. I am not exaggerating.&quot;    In light of such comments, there is a certain irony in recent decisions, both by the Texas and the California state boards of education, to reject science textbooks on the ground that they &quot;water down&quot; instruction on evolution. In California the superintendent of public instruction, Bill Honig, has been depicted as something of a latter-day Galileo, bravely standing up to the forces of reaction by insisting that &quot;we must send a message to the publishing industry that we cannot tiptoe around certain subjects just because they are controversial.&quot; New texts will be more assertive about evolution than were their predecessors, and perhaps ultimately more misleading for that reason. Nonetheless, Mr. Honig vows: &quot;We are going to establish policy for the rest of the country.&quot;    Mr. Honig's use of the word &quot;controversial&quot; suggests that we must not shrink from the truth just because some parents don't like it. But the truth is that there is great uncertainty about what (if anything) is known about evolution. Those who embrace controversy should be fearless in pointing this out. Louisiana's unsatisfactory &quot;balanced treatment&quot; law and the legal contest surrounding it show what can happen when we too timidly submit to scientific authoritarianism.    ---   Mr. Bethell, a media fellow at the Hoover Institution and a contributor to the American Spectator, has been at work on a book about evolution. </TEXT></DOC>
