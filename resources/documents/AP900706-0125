The competition, which began June 14, drew 335 competitors from51 countries. It took on special significance because this year isthe 150th anniversary of Tchaikovsky's birth.   The gold medalists will perform at a special concert Saturdaynight, and the runners-up will play on Sunday.   ``I feel totally exhausted,'' Voigt, 29, said Friday. ``It was agrueling and grinding experience.''   The soprano and former apprentice with the San Francisco OperaCompany celebrated with champagne, and plans a U.S. concert tourstarting in Chicago.   Choi, a baritone and former student at the La Scala operacompany of Milan, Italy, had said his biggest problem was language.``I must sing in six languages, and I must sing perfectly in sixlanguanges, because the judges come from so many countries.''   Suwanai, 18, of Tokyo, told the Tass news agency she was happyto win a first prize after coming in second at contests in Genoa,Brussels and Japan.   She said some credit for her victory had to go to Tchaikovsky.``He is not just my most favorite composer. Possibly, there is noother composer who is so close to me spiritually.''   Park, a junior in high school who also studied at the CincinnatiConservatory of Music, won the bronze for her renditions of worksby Tchaikovsky, Paganini, Mozart and Bartok.   In an interview after the winners were announced, she said: ``Iwas very honored, but also very puzzled,'' because theinternational jury awarded her the medals for the most artistic andmost talented, but only ranked her third overall.   Park, the youngest of the 65 violinists who entered thecompetition, admitted feeling some tension, ``but I just tried totreat it as a concert and play.''   Berezovsky, a 22-year-old student of the Moscow Conservatory,won for his performance of works by Tchaikovsky, Chopin and Liszt.   The international jury also awarded two fourth prizes topianists Rolf Plagge of West Germany and Stephen Prutsman, of LosAngeles.   Ten Americans were among the 48 finalists who competed Thursdaynight.   For the first time since the competition began in 1958, foreignfunding was used for organizing the contest.
