It's the legacy I will leavemy children.''   He is thickset and stocky, with Popeye biceps, unanchoredshirttail and a face that evokes a Connecticut autumn: sky-blueeyes, wind-chapped skin and a chinful of reddish-gold scrub. A tinygold anchor pierces one earlobe, and a faded denim cap stained withfish blood moors his hair.   A self-described ``walking contradiction,'' he's a smoker whoworries about air quality; a fisherman who frequents a seafoodrestaurant, then orders hot dogs for lunch.   He's also a pollution fighter who objects to being called anenvironmentalist, ``a word that conjures up images of kooks incanoes, tree-huggers, liberals.''   He prefers ``fisherman,'' and when asked why, cites King James:``My God, it's a noble trade! It was the apostles' own calling.''   ``There is something noble about being a fisherman, aboutproducing food for people to eat,'' Backer says.   However, it was restlessness, not nobility, that led him tochoose his father's lobster boat over a high school education. Healso worked at a gas station, then set off at 16 to see the world.   ``I picked crops in California, I logged in Oregon. To give youan idea of the politicizing of Terry Backer, I once owned a T-shirtthat said, `Sierra Club: Kiss My Ax.' There is some confusion insociety about just what natural resources are for.''   The T-shirt is long gone, as is any confusion on its owner'spart. ``The Earth is for everyone,'' Backer says.   ``I'm not against progress. But if progress means water youcan't drink, plants you can't grow, fish you can't eat and air youcan't breathe, we need to redefine progress.''   His effort on behalf of the sound began in earnest after afishing trip to Alaska in the early '70s. ``It was very beautiful _as pristine as you can get. Then I came back here to work with myfather and one day, while looking over the side of the boat, I sawthat the place had really gone downhill. There were rafts of humansewage floating downriver.   ``Each generation leaves less behind. My grandfather didn't knowit could all be consumed, that it could be possible to dig out allthe marshes. How we got here is ignorance. How we stay here isarrogance.''   Backer's credentials as a fisherman help buttress his argument.``He's not an ivory-tower environmentalist,'' Kennedy says. ``Hecan be much more persuasive because he's able to say, `I've got afamily that may go hungry because you are discharging this stuffinto Long Island Sound and I want you to stop.' Or, `Because youare dredging this shoal for your pleasure boat, I'm going to loseincome this year.'''   ``The idea that environmentalists take jobs away from people isstill very prevalent,'' Backer says. ``We've becomesupermarketized. Clean water and the first 6 inches of soil arewhat keep us all going.   ``People say that you can't compare worms and clams with people.What I'm trying to tell them is that when the worms and the clamsgo, we are not far behind.''   He uses a donated 19-foot powerboat to look for things thatdon't belong: dead fish, raw sewage, detergent foam, spewing pipes.The boat is small for a reason. ``Most of the problems are rightaround the edges,'' in shallow water. With 86 sewage treatmentplants all emptying into the sound, there's always something tofind.   On this particular Sunday _ ``Sundays are good days to catchpeople doing things they shouldn't be doing'' _ he finds a solventleaving a sheen on the surface of the Norwalk River.   Backer frowns at the sight of a hen mallard dipping her billinto a tiny oil slick, then follows the trail until the rivernarrows, forcing him to turn back. He'll cover the rest of thedistance on foot.   ``When I find something in the water, that's when the real workbegins.'' Tracking the culprit could take weeks. Much of the workis done in the office, the second floor of an aging clapboard houseoverlooking an inlet.   A hand-lettered sign over the door says ``War Room.''   ``It's considered good form for people involved in causes to saythings like, `There are no enemies here,''' Backer says. ``Butthere is an enemy. The enemy is people, companies, municipalities.Whoever puts that dollar ahead of the environment that's going tosustain my kids, you're my enemy.''   Far more battles take place in the hearing room than thecourtroom. ``Every problem doesn't need to be addressed with alawsuit,'' Backer says. ``If I can go to a community and talk topeople, write letters, or show up and do interviews with the localnewspapers, a lot of times that's all it takes to get peoplethinking differently.   ``Government works best when people participate. Without citizeninput, the guys in the $800 suits are going to get what they wantfor the people they work for.''   Though the battles continue, Backer believes he and the soundalready have won the war. ``What we've won is an awareness aroundthe area that someone is here, and someone is watching.''</TEXT><NOTE>END ADV</NOTE></DOC>
