But in what Jesse Jackson calls ``the newSouth,'' his relationship with Bert Lance is a sign of the times.   Lance, long a fixture on the Georgia political scene and thebudget director under former President Jimmy Carter, is one ofJackson's closest advisers in his 1988 presidential bid.   ``I have a relationship that's fairly well known with Rev.Jackson,'' Lance said in a telephone interview. ``He is a very goodcandidate who has run a superb campaign.''   Lance supported Jackson in Georgia's primary last week and,according to Jackson aides, the two consult by telephone as oftenas once a day.   ``Jesse Jackson has got a message that the country is concernedabout _ especially about drugs, especially about economic commonground. These things are important to the country,'' said Lance,who left the Carter administration under a cloud of allegationsabout his previous activities as a banker.   He declined to specify what advice he gives Jackson, but saidtheir relationship began during Jackson's 1984 White House bid.   The relationship demonstrates how the candidate who ran under ananti-establishment banner four years ago now is reaching out forestablishment advice as he tries to craft a more mainstreamcampaign and expand his base beyond his core black constituency.   So far, the gambit seems on course. Jackson has made nosignificant gaffes in his campaign _ avoiding the kind of slipsthat alienated Jewish voters in 1984 when he used the words``Hymie'' and ``Hymietown.''   And he has been winning white votes in far greater numbers thanhe did in 1984.   He also consults at times with such party leaders as JimmyCarter, Clark Clifford, and Shirley Chisholm, according to hispress secretary.   Among Jackson's close advisers is political consultant AnnLewis, former Democratic National Committee political director. Oneof his biggest boosters among political strategy types, she hasgiven him pointers on Jewish and women's questions, and campaignstrategy, especially in the many months before he hired a campaignmanager.   Lewis introduced Jackson to Carol O'Cleireacain, an official ofthe American Federation of State, County and Municipal EmployeesUnion who has become a key economic adviser. She was primarilyresponsible for conceiving one of Jackson's central economicthemes, a proposal to reinvest corporate pension funds in domesticjobs programs.   Democrat William Gray, chairman of the House Budget Committee,is another Jackson economic adviser.   On foreign policy matters, Jackson leans on Bob Borosage, whotook a leave from his job as director of the liberal think tank,Institute for Policy Studies, to advise the campaign and travelwith Jackson; Rep. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., a member of the HouseArmed Services Committee; and Jim Zogby, head of the Arab AmericanInstitute.   Jackson signed up one of California's most powerfulofficeholders and savvy black politicians, Assembly Speaker WillieBrown, as his campaign chairman. Another confidant is WalterFauntroy, the non-voting House member from the District of Columbia.   Texas Agriculture Commissioner Jim Hightower has endorsedJackson and advises him on farm policy. Former New Mexico Gov.Toney Anaya and Mississippi educator Armando Guitierrez specializein Hispanic issues.   Jackson's most senior aide is Frank Watkins, who met him in1969. Watkins is devoting himself to analysing and targeting statesand congressional districts.   One change from 1984 is a semblance of organization in theJackson campaign, thanks in large part to campaign manager GeraldAustin. The 11th-hour addition of Austin last fall gave thecampaign a sense that ``somebody is running the railroad,'' saidLewis.   ``He really has provided the structural underpinning to supportJackson that I don't think Jackson ever had before,'' she said.   A no-nonsense political operative who managed Gov. RichardCeleste's campaign in Ohio, Austin is Jewish and said he had beenoffended by Jackson's reference to Jews as ``Hymie.'' He confrontedJackson on the topic before taking the job, and said he acceptedthe apology the candidate offered.   Austin has turned around the campaign's tendency towardindecisiveness, say some who deal with the campaign. He alsodeveloped Jackson's TV commercials himself.   A direct mail operation is in place, run by California mailconsultant Mal Warwick. He is getting good results by targeting aspectrum of Democratic voters, and the mail has become a majorparty of fund-raising for the cash poor campaign.</TEXT></DOC>
