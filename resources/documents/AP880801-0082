GRAY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Burmese government announced todayit arrested the country's most prominent dissident and nine otherpeople to prevent an attack against the state.   Official Rangoon radio, monitored in Bangkok, said action wouldbe taken against dissident Aung Gyi and the nine others ``accordingto criminal law procedures.''   The broadcast did not mention Associated Press correspondentSein Win or several other people said to have been detained in asweep last week.   ``In order to prevent an attack against the state, aspreventative measures, authorities ... detained Aung Gyi and hisassociates...as from July 29, 1988,'' the announcement said.   It was the first official word of the arrests, which had beenreported by Western diplomats in Rangoon, Burma's capital, and theU.S. State Department.   The men listed in the broadcast were retired military officers,many of whom had supported former leader Ne Win in his early yearsin power. Most are in their mid- to late 60s.   Ne Win resigned abruptly last month after 26 years ofauthoritarian rule. He was replaced by Sein Lwin, a former generalknown for his brutal suppression of dissent.   The U.S. Embassy in Burma today reportedly made an officialinquiry into the status of AP correspondent Sein Win, who diplomatssaid was being held with the others at Insein prison on theoutskirts of Rangoon.   Leaflets circulated by student groups in the city, meanwhile,called for a nationwide strike Aug. 8 against the current regime,Western diplomatic sources said.   The sources, who asked not to be further identified, said atleast some of the leaflets came from the All Burma UniversitiesStudents Democratic League, which has been demanding the removal ofnew leader Sein Lwin.   Aung Gyi, 70, emerged this year as the most outspoken critic ofBurma's government through a series of letters he wrote decryingeconomic and political conditions in Burma.   In the letters, which were widely circulated in Rangoon, AungGyi singled out Sein Lwin for ``turning a blind eye'' to grosshuman rights abuses during bloody student riots last March and June.   The radio broadcast said those arrested along with the70-year-old Aung Gyi were Kyi Han, Tun Win, Ba Shwe, Khin Nyo, KyiMaung, Tun Shwe, Chit Ko Ko, Aung Win and Zaw Win.   Retired colonels Kyi Muang and Khin Nyo were in Ne Win'sRevolutionary Council after he seized power in 1962. Kyi Maung leftNe Win's government in 1963 and Khin Nyo was fired in 1965.   Han Kyi has once served as military attache in Washington and asambassador to Manila. Ba Shwe formerly served as ambassador toIndia.   The diplomatic sources said Aung Shwe, a former general who oncewas ambassador to Australia, also was held.   Rangoon was reported quiet today after a week of majorleadership changes and one small student demonstration.   Virtually all the country's institutes of higher learnig wereclosed following student riots in June. They are scheduled to openlater this month.   Reporter Sein Win, 66, a onetime publisher of theEnglish-language newspaper The Guardian, was awarded the Golden Penof Freedom by the Paris-based International Federation ofJournalists in 1963. He was jailed for three years in the 1960salong with thousands of other political prisoners.</TEXT></DOC>
