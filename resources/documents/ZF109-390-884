 Louis, MO), 1990 was not merely the end of an old decade.andO;It was the year they introduced On-Traq, a sophisticated component whichgives users real-time status information.andP;  On-Traq proffers versatileinformation sorting, team status displays and walkaway monitoring tools suchas color-coded alarm displays and message board drivers.andM;Affinitec's Analyser is another component worth tooting a horn about.andO;Analyser is actually two software packages in one Queue Performance andEmployee Performance.andP;  Analyser collects, stores, assesses and reports avariety of key results at both the overall call center and the individualagent level.andM;Forecaster takes advantage of each call center's particular call patterns andcompany objectives to generate predictions of the future workload.andP;  Theforecasts include average time required to handle each call, the number ofanticipated calls per quarter- or half-hour, and the number of agents neededto handle the inbound rush to meet expected service levels.andM;Scheduler uses Forecaster data and the roster of available agents to selectand place full-time and part-time shifts.andP;  This component takes into accountavailability as well as agent preference.andP;  It provides optional or mandatoryoff-line requests to schedule other activities when you've got too many idleagents.andM;In-Charge enables call managers to enter changes and exceptions to the dailyemployee list within a real-time framework.andP;  Attendance, meanwhile, gives youan easy, accurate way to track and support employee absence and tardystatistics.andM;A variety of standard reports is available for all products, and all of themcan be customized to fit the intended one's needs.andP;  Take note, also, that thecomponents outlined above constitute a total service package includinginstallation, implementation, training, on-site field service andmaintenance, phone support and consulting.andM;Cybernotics Systems internationalandM;EMPS (Employee Management Planning System)andM;Runs on the following hardware: All computer platformsandM;Compatible with: All major ACD manufacturersandM;Real-time statistics?: yesandM;Color graphics?: yesandM;Major varieties of reports: Forecasting, manpower coverage, work schedules,consolidated network coverage, intra-day  forecasting,  workloadrequirements, employee information.andP;  Ballpark retail price: $25,000 and up.andM;The Employee Management Planning System (EMPS) by Cybernetics (Coral Gables,FL) boasts a flexible design and a clever modular construction.andP;  EMPS iscomposed of several  interactive programs which together automate planningand control of your call center personnel.andP;  We'll sketch each of thembriefly:andM;A Data Gathering Interface receives and keeps traffic and transaction infofrom the ACD.andP;  Employee and function data are available on demand, and othersystem components are automatically updated as required.andP;  A Work History andForecasting module furnishes storage and retrieval of workload data for eachfunction.andP;  Data can be stowed away in daily or half-hourly increments.andO;Workloads can be charted for the coming day, week or month.andP;  Daily forecastscan be set in minuscule five-minute increments.andM;A Scheduling module establishes day-off and start-time patterns.andP;  It alsoputs together that complex of shift types to best serve your call centerneeds.andP;  These shifts can be allocated to different work areas, if necessary.andO;Drawing on past work history, a Requirements arm determines how many agentsare needed to meet a given workload at a particular time of daY.andM;A trunking module finds the grade of service of trunk groups and number oftrunks needed to satisfy grade-of-service targets.andP;  Shift Assignment matchesemployees to a preset number of required shifts - according to theirseniority and personal preference.andM;A Network Management component lets customers tap into remote auxiliaryprocessors, for multiple site calculations.andP;  Lastly, an Administration moduleestablishes and keeps up a database of work hours, employees and assignments.andO;It also evaluates the status of your agents against the workload.andM;HTL Telemanagement, Ltd.andM;ACD Solution SoftwareandM;Compatible with: All major ACD manufacturersandM;Runs on following hardware: IBM and compatible PCsandM;Real-time statistics?: no, but it works with real-time stats.andM;Color graphics?: noandM;Major varieties of reports: Single-period analysis, multi-period analysisbased on current optimizations and minimum cost, grade of service, reports bynumber of agents or by number of agents and lines.andP;  Ballpark retail price:$2,500 annual license fee (not purchase), which is reduced after the firstyear.andM;HTL Telemanagement's (Burtonsville, MD) ACD Solution Software is orientedtowards ACDs with single gates - switches needing in-WATs, a usage-sensitiveFX and alternative service.andP;  ACD Solution Software can formulate an optimalconfiguration for these switches, taking into consideration cost, averageagent talk-time and workloads.andP;  The package can also accommodate multigateapplications, handling up to 500 agents and 800 trunks.andM;ACD Solution Software is a standalone module, generating multi-periodanalyses, forecasting reports and  &quot;what-if&quot; scenarios.andP;  Call center managerscan use this data to chart the service level most amenable to theirparticular environment.andP;  They also can determine whether the number of groupsand agents should be increased, decreased or held steady.andM;The package assimilates ACD summary reports - work duration, averageconversation time, amount of calls per half hour - into its database.andP;  Ittakes into consideration both the number of trunks in use and particulargrades of service while making predictions.andM;ACD Solution Software can make several &quot;what if&quot; predictions.andP;  For instance,given a certain increase in inbound calls, it will let you know how manycallers would be put on hold, how many would hang up and how your currentclass of service would hold up.andP;  It can also tell you how many trunks andextra agents you'll need to meet targeted service levels.andM;MTC SystemsandM;ACD Time ManagerandM;Compatible with: ACD Time Manger - all Rolm 8000, 9000, 9751;
