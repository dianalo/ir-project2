If wewant to save jobs; we've got to know, in advance, that a factory ora plant is in trouble. We've got to give governors and mayors andcommunity leaders a chance to go to work to save those jobs; tokeep that plant open; to cushion the blow for the community wherethat plant is located.   The national plant closing bill approved by Congress will helpus to save jobs. It will help our workers to get the skills to findnew jobs. It will help our communities by keeping plants open. Itwill help our taxpayers by reducing the cost of unemploymentinsurance and welfare. It should be the law of the land.   Finally, if we're serious about winning the battle for oureconomic future, we've got to get control of the merger andacquisition binge that's gobbling up our capital, destroyingcompetition, and creating billions in profits for a few, withoutcreating a single new job for American workers.   Today, too many of our best educated and most talented citizensare using their skills not in America's war against foreigncompetition; but in a civil war for paper profits _ a war that pitsregion against region, business against business, and managementagainst labor; a war that weakens our economy at home and ourcompetitiveness abroad; a war whose primary victims are the workingmen and women of America.   During the past five years, more than 12,000 Americancorporations have changed hands. Today, according to Business Week,the corporate takeover wave is ``skyscraper high.'' We've had 15takeover bids of a billion dollars or more since New Year's Day _less than four months ago.   And what have we got to show for it?   Massive corporate debt. Lower quality products. Workers throwninto the streets. A less competitive America.   And the profits they're making are unbelievable. We've seencorporate raiders make $140 million trying to take over Safeway,while 35,000 workers were laid off.   We've seen raiders make $160 million in a deal that forcedGoodyear so far into debt it had to shut down plants in highunemployment areas in Maryland and Michigan. And for the people ofAkron _ the community here in Ohio which depends so heavily onlythe long-term success of Goodyear _ there now is, in the words ofits congressman and former Mayor Tom Sawyer, ``a lingering sense ofinsecurity not only for the future of Goodyear, but for the futureof our community.''   Altogether, 500,000 workers have lost their jobs as a result ofthe merger mania in recent years; and thousands more have hadpension plans terminated so that companies could skim the surplusoff those pension funds.   And why are we putting up with this? Because we have a LaborDepartment and an NLRB that won't stand up for the Americanworkers. Because we've got an attorney general who couldn't tellthe difference between antitrust and antifreeze; and a FederalTrade Commission that seems to have forgotten that its job is topromote and encourage competition in the American marketplace.   Wall Street pirates and corporate hit teams aren't a model forthe best America. To build the future we want, we're going to haveto do what my parents and millions of immigrants did when they cameto this country. Work hard. Save. Invest. Produce, not justconsume. Make sure that the label ``Made in America'' _ the unionlabel _ is a symbol of quality and durability and value all overthe world.   My friends, America isn't just a place; it's not just anotherpiece of land; or just another country. It's the noblest experimentever undertaken on this planet. It's a symbol of what we humanbeings can do _ when we work together; when we respect each other;when we understand that we are one people. One nation. Onecommunity.   Because there are no shortcuts to the American dream.   The best America doesn't hide; we compete.   The best America doesn't waste; we invest.   The best America doesn't leave some of its citizens behind; wework for everyone.   The best America doesn't yearn for the past; we prepare to takeon the future.   The best America isn't behind us; the best America is yet tocome.   The best America is a nation where the son of Greek immigrantscan seek _ and win _ the presidency of the United States.   Thank you very much.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, May 15</NOTE></DOC>
