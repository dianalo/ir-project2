Bush's proposal, in addition to hitting taxpayers for half of a$90 billion problem, calls for the most sweeping regulatory overhaulsince federal deposit insurance agencies were established in 1933.   Specifically, the president would:   _Strip the Sandamp;L insurance fund, the Federal Savings and LoanInsurance Corp., from its parent agency, the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, and merge it into the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., whichguarantees bank deposits.   _Take what's left of the bank board and make it part of theTreasury Department. The comptroller of the currency, part of thedepartment, has regulated national banks since the Civil War.   ``This is the most comprehensive restructuring of the thriftregulatory structure that we will see in our lifetime,'' saidKenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of Independent BankersAssociation of America.   Guenther, whose group represents small commercial banks, said theBush proposal addresses one of the root causes of today's Sandamp;Lproblems: coziness between the bank board and the industry it wassupposed to be regulating.   ``The Federal Home Loan Bank Board has been the sweetheartregulator of the thrift industry,'' Guenther said. Bush's plan``ensures that never again will there be such sweetheart regulatorsand never again will we have to undergo this type of comprehensiverestructuring.''   The enlarged FDIC within two years would force Sandamp;Ls to complywith stricter regulatory standards that now apply only to banks.   Sandamp;L owners will also be required to put up more of their ownmoney. By June 1991, the capital standard for Sandamp;Ls would double fromthe current 3 percent to 6 percent, which is now the standard forbanks.   Thus, Sandamp;Ls would lose many of the competitive advantages theyhave enjoyed while still operating with one major disadvantage. Asthey have since 1985 and are expected to into the forseeable future,thrifts would pay higher deposit insurance premiums than banks.   The Bush plan raises Sandamp;L premiums from $2.08 per $1,000 indeposits to $2.30. Bank premiums would go from 83 cents to $1.50.   Bert Ely, a financial institutions analyst in Alexandria, Va.,said thrifts would have so much trouble raising new capital andpaying higher premiums that the Federal Reserve Board could bepressured into allowing bank holding companies to buy Sandamp;Ls.   ``We're going to see a lot of cross-industry mergers,'' he said.   Bud Koch, chairman of the National Council of SavingsInstitutions, said Sandamp;Ls should be given more time to meet thecapital standard and warned that the government could wind upcreating more failures.   ``What they've done is put the industry in a straitjacket, put itinto the corner and said, `We're going to tax you out ofexistence,''' Koch said.   Meanwhile, FDIC officials estimated at a briefing Tuesday thatthe premium increase could put several dozen weak commercial banksin danger of failure, but said premiums might be eased for thosebanks.   Robert Litan, a banking expert with the Brookings Institution,said the bank board, as part of the Treasury Department, would notnecessarily be any less receptive to influence by Sandamp;Ls.   ``I think this is just a very initial tentative step towardmerging the two industries. ... The way I read between the lines isthe Bush people have decided not to tackle the very tough politicalissue of ending the thrift industry. ... I clearly think they'relooking at this in stages, but they're not going public on what thenext stage is,'' he said.   Nevertheless, the Sandamp;L industry's chief lobbying group, the U.S.League of Savings Institutions, is gearing up to fight.   ``It is a proposal. It is no more of a done deal than a budget iswhen the president sends it to Congress. The fact is, it is theWhite House and the Treasury's wish. That does not translate into itbecoming fact,'' said Mark Clark, a senior vice president of the Sandamp;Lassociation.   A key Sandamp;L ally in the fight will be Rep. Frank Annunzio, D-Ill.,the chairman of the House Banking subcommittee with jurisdictionover thrifts. Annunzio is a longtime advocate of an old-fashionedthrift industry catering to home mortgage borrowers.   ``Treasury has long shown that it does not favor a separate homelending agency. Once it got its hands on control of the Feeral HomeLoan Bank Board, it would move to eliminate the industry,'' Annunziopredicted.   Thrift executives are pointing privately to Treasury SecretaryNicholas F. Brady's ties to Wall Street, where he headed theinvestment banking firm of Dillon, Read andamp; Co., as evidence of a biasagainst thrifts.   According to a financial industry source who spoke on conditionof anonymity, the question of subsuming the bank board into theTreasury Department was hotly debated within the Bush administration.   Richard Breeden, the Bush aide in charge of Sandamp;L matters, pushedstrongly for the Treasury oversight and was backed by FederalReserve Chairman Alan Greenspan at a luncheon meeting with BushSaturday at the Camp David, Md., presidential retreat, the sourcesaid.</TEXT></DOC>
