In the year-earlier quarter, the biotechnology concern had a loss of $2.1 million on revenue of $2.3 million.    Molecular said the charge will largely offset a $3.5 million gain posted in the second quarter from the sale of a majority stake in a Dutch subsidiary, resulting in a loss for the year that will be &quot;slightly lower&quot; than the $4 million loss for 1986.    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Molecular shares closed at $3.1875, down 12.5 cents.    The company said $2.2 million of the charge stems from the write-down of certain assets at its research facilities and manufacturing plant. Most of the balance covers severance obligations from the termination of 72 employees' jobs, the company said.    In November, Molecular employed about 135 people when it announced plans to discontinue animal health research and manufacturing. At the time, the company said the cutback would mean substantial staff reductions. A spokeswoman said total employment could reach 79 within a couple of months, because of the addition of 16 jobs. </TEXT></DOC>
