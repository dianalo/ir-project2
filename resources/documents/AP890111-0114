In a compromise between the United States and Arab nations, thefinal declaration did not explicitly link the control of nuclear andchemical weapons but referred to a 1978 United Nations document thatdoes so.   U.S. delegates said they were pleased with the declaration, whichofficials from 150 nations adopted by consensus after a five-daymeeting.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles Redman said theadministration was pleased with the outcome of the conference.   ``The U.S. objectives for the conference were to focus worldwideattention on the problems of chemical weapons use and chemicalweapons proliferation and help put a stop to the use of theseweapons in violation of international law,'' he said.   The document reaffirmed the 1925 Geneva Protocol prohibiting theuse of chemical weapons and called for stepped-up negotitions inGeneva to ban the development, production and storage of chemicalarms. It also urged giving the U.N. secretary-general more power toinvestigate chemical weapons use.   The participating states ``solemnly affirm their commitments notto use chemical weapons and condemn such use. They recall theirserous concern at recent violations as established and condemned bythe competent organs of the United Nations,'' the declaration said.   ``The participating states stress the necessity of concluding, atan early date, a convention on the prohibition of the development,production, stockpiling and use of all chemical weapons, and ontheir destruction. This convention shall be global and comprehensiveand effectively verifiable.''   Arriving at a consensus required days of haggling and compromise.U.S. officials said that they got more than they expected.   ``We're very pleased with a very substantive declaration thathits all the main points that the conference should haveaddressed,'' said Gary Crocker, a member of the U.S. delegation.``The important thing is that we have the world's attention focusedon this serious problem.''   The declaration, which is not binding, illustrates ``the commonwill of nations to condemn chemical weapons,'' Kalevi Sorsa ofFinland, chairman of the drafting committee, told reporters afterthe meeting ended.   Sorsa said obtaining a consensus ``required concessions andcompromises from all sides.'' But, ``From here on we can refer backto the Paris conference and its text.''   The resolution reaffirms participating nations' commitment to aGeneva protocol that bans the use of chemical weapons but not theirproduction and storage. The protocol often has been ignored since itwas signed 67 years ago.   Arab delegates failed to persuade the meeting to implicitlycondemn Israel's alleged nuclear capability. Foreign Minister TariqAziz of Iraq said he and his Arab colleagues finally decided not totake a position that would prevent the success of the conference.   Work on the declaration continued through Tuesday night toreconcile deep-seated differences between industrialized nations andArab states. Including the word ``nuclear'' became the main obstacleto consensus.   Arab states wishing to retain the right to have chemical weaponsto offset Israel's alleged nuclear force, had asked that chemicaldisarmament be linked directly to nuclear disarmament, a positionopposed by the United States and the Soviet Union.   In the end, the declaration excluded the word ``nuclear,'' butreferred to the final declaration of the 1978 U.N. General Assemblysession devoted to disarmament that linked nuclear and chemicalnegotiations.   Aziz complained, ``That draft falls short of our concerns ...Where there is one country that has nuclear weapons and that countrythat has mass destruction weapons is not a signatory to thenon-proliferation treaty ... and has refused to reach peace ... thatnation constitutes a real threat to the peace and security of theregion.''   Both the superpowers have thousands of tons of chemical weaponsin storage, and the United States has a program to develop newsophisticated systems.   Another 20 nations, including many at the conference, possess theweapons or are in the process of developing them.</TEXT></DOC>
