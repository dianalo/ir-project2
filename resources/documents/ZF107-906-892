moreover,with the various developments taking place in the telecommunicationsindustry, it is an anonymity that Telettra accepts could become increasinglydisadvantageous.andP;  But there are a number of large barriers to overcome beforeTelettra can achieve the &quot;minimum level of awareness&quot; it feels that it needsboth in Italy and abroad.andM;OvershadowingandM;One of the reasons that even the average Italian in the street has only thevaguest idea of what the company actually does, and why its main rival in thehome market, Italtel SpA, is more famous, is undoubtedly the overshadowingeffect experienced due to the size of Telettra's parent company, Fiat SpA,which many Italians feel is in fact becoming too dominant in Italy, where 50%of Telettra's sales are still made; the main reason, however, is the natureof the continually changing transmission technology that makes up Telettra'sbusiness: as Terry Tyzack, manager of the Communication and Image Departmentpoints out, &quot;if you produce cigarettes, wine or tables (the conversation tookplace in a restaurant), people immediately know who you are&quot;, but he acceptsthat as a supplier of transmission technology, most of Telettra's productsand services often lack the tangibility required to enter the publicimagination - a phenomen that also results from the fact that the fast paceof the industry means that at any one given time, 60% of Telettra's productsare less than three years old.andP;  Around 75% of Telettra's sales are in thepublic network market, with products for transmission on physical lines, suchas multiplexers and digital systems on optical fibres, and products fortransmission on radio carriers, such as microwave radio link systems andpublic mobile radio - physical line and radio carrier product ranges bothaccount for roughly a third of Telettra's sales to the public network market;sales to private networks, which account for around a fifth of totalturnover, are largely taken up with High Voltage and Medium Voltage powerline carrier systems, train to ground communication systems, and a wide rangeof other transmission products; supervisory systems for various forms ofnetworks, private branch exchanges and key telephone systems take up the restof Telettra's involvement in this area.andP;  When one looks at the kind oftechnology on which these products are based - Gallium Arsenide Field EffectTransistors, various optical components, high density circuits, mechanicaland quartz filters, and things known as microwave cavity resonators - oneappreciates the problem Telettra has in achieving the kind of profile enjoyedby the switch makers and network operators, such as BritishTelecommunications, that form a large part of its customer base.andM;- By Mark John -andM;And yet Tyzack argues that this low profile belies the extent of Telettra'sinvolvement on the international telecommunications scene.andP;  Through itsSpanish subsidiary Telettra Espana, in which Telefonica de Espana has a 10%stake, Telettra has taken around a half of the Spanish transmission systemsmarket, and has deals in the Soviet Union, Pakistan and Libya as well as ajoint contract with L M Ericsson's Intesa SA arm to build the digitalcellular telephone system for the city of Barcelona; Telettra also suppliesmicrowave systems to British Telecom, and optical fibre lines to MercuryCommunications, and apart from its main bases in Italy and Spain, has another20 odd offices scattered around the world; one of these, Telettra Mexico, hasjust won a $12m deal to install a rural telephone multi-access network inMexico, so strengthening what seems to be a natural and potentiallysignificant relationship with Latin American descendants in the growing SouthAmerican telecommunications market.andP;  However, the increasingly internationalcharacter of the telecommunications industry, and the sharpening ofcompetition that is expected to result from the creation of a single Europeanmarket, means that firms such as Telettra can count less and less on anestablished markets, home or abroad: what is more, Telettra is, comparativelyspeaking, by no means a large organisation, and parent company Fiat, with itsmain interest being the volatile car industry, could not always be counted onto bail Telettra out if times were hard in its core motor business.andP;  Althoughnot as exposed as switching companies will be, Telettra is without doubtaware of this potentially difficult future as it holds talks with &quot;the mainsix to eight companies in the field&quot; on the subject of a merger, or, as seemsmore likely, a joint venture including mutually beneficial 7marketingagreements with a large international company, possibly in the switchingsector of the industry - the outcome of these talks, however, is unlikely tobe known before the middle of next year.andM;1990 World CupandM;In the meantime, Telettra is preparing an extensive international advertisingcampaign intended to achieve the desired level of awareness about the companybefore things start to hot up, with one possible emphasis being the guaranteeof quality that Telettra feels it can offer - a campaign that, regardless ofthe quality of Telettra's products, will seem more credible now that Fiat hasmanaged to shake the image it had 10 years ago of producing &quot;rustboxes&quot;.andP;  Andfinally, in what seems like a heaven-sent opportunity to make a name foritself, particularly in its own country, Telettra is also taking advantage ofthe fact that Italy is hosting next year's World Cup soccer finals byinvolving itself in a project to set up a number of high-definitiontelevision screens relaying live pictures of the matches to cities all overthe country - and if that initiative can't increase awareness abouttransmission technology among the football-crazy Italians, then probablynothing can.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
