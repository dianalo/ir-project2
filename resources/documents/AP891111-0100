As the sun set over Berlin on Saturday, Himpel hadn't spent apfennig. The wall was open all day, but stores in West Germanyclose for the weekend at 2 p.m. Saturday, by law. The law wassuspended in some parts of West Germany because of the specialcircumstances, but not in downtown West Berlin.   Although they could not shop, the family returned home withsouvenir memories: a kiss from a drunk, a U-turn with a befuddledold woman in a crowded Volkswagen van and a feeling of bewildermentin a strange land, the other half of their own Germany's capitalcity.   They also had all 400 marks ($220) the family collected from theWest German government, which offers 100 marks to each new arrivalfrom East Germany.   ``It could have been a lot better,'' Himpel said, disdaining thetrinkets available in a street market. ``We'll come back. Now wehave the opportunity.''   The family had driven 4{ hours from their home in Siebenlehn, atown of 1,200 where Himpel and his wife Monika run an auto bodyshop.   They specialize in fixing Trabants, the gimcrack East Germancars abandoned by the thousands of East Germans who moved West inthe weeks before the wall was opened. A ``Trabbi'' usually rustsbefore it's dented, Himpel said.   It took 90 minutes to get into West Berlin from the Easternsector, then there was a three-hour wait at the Bank fuer Handelund Industrie for the ``welcome money.''   While Himpel stood in line, 11-year-old Tanja and Lars, 12,checked out the Ratzekatz toy shop, marking it as stop No. 1 on theshopping spree.   With the marks in hand, however, the family found a long lineoutside the toy shop. ``Just like home,'' Mrs. Himpel, a cheerfulwoman, said with a shrug.   They went along to the Hertie department store. It was closed.Lars looked thunderstruck.   The sun now hugged the horizon on a crisp autumn day that wasturning cold. They tried the subway, but police were directingpeople away because it was too crowded. They waited for a bus, invain. Taxis rolled by, but all were taken.   At another bus stop, the Himpels got lucky with a Volkswagenvan. Albrecht Gramberg, the owner, waved them into the back alongwith two other East Germans and an elderly woman with a cane whohad to be coaxed aboard.   Three more people filled the front seat and Gramberg laughedloudly as two more hitchhikers tried to flag him down.   ``I get the impression that everyone in Berlin is stoned,'' hesaid. ``It's like Woodstock _ love, peace and happiness _ becauseall signs and symbols of power are done.''   ``In another month, it has to be more serious,'' he added inEnglish, ``but for now, it's a lot of fun.''   A woman in the back, spending her second day in the West withouthaving gotten into a store, said it also was very frustrating.   Hardly the best place for a lady with a cane she observed to theelderly woman, who replied: ``I live here.'' Where? Back by the busstop. Gramberg made a U-turn.   By 4:30, hunger had led them to a tavern for bratwurst allaround.   No more bratwurst, the waitress said.   ``Just like home,'' Mrs. Himpel said.   A small, dark-haired woman lurched to the table, brimming withbeer and good will.   ``You're just like us, just like us,'' she said, and planted abig smack on Mrs. Himpel's cheek while Tanja made faces behind her.   ``She's not a regular,'' the waitress explained, ``but today,nothing is normal.''</TEXT></DOC>
