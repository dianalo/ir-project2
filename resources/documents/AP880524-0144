The Party for Peace and Democracy, led by former presidentialcandidate Kim Dae-jung, said recent anti-U.S. protests were causedin part by attempts to subordinate Korean policy to U.S. interests.   But the oppositon party called on protesters to halt violentattacks on U.S. diplomatic offices and said it did not endorsecalls for the removal of American troops from South Korea.   ``Although we understand the feelings of the students, westrongly ask them not to use violence under any circumstances,''the opposition party said in its harshest criticism of the UnitedStates in recent months.   Students have attacked U.S. diplomatic posts in Seoul and thesouthern city of Kwangju since violent protests began Wednesday tomark the eighth anniversary of a civil uprising in the southerncity of Kwangju.   The dissidents have called for the overthrow of President RohTae-woo and the removal of 42,000 U.S. troops based in South Koreaunder a mutual defense pact.   Protesters hurled firebombs and rocks at the U.S. InformationService building in Kwangju on Monday and threw home-made bombs atthe U.S. Embassy in Seoul on Friday after an attack on the nearbyU.S. Information Service office the day before.   On Tuesday, scattered clashes continued in Kwangju, 165 milessouth of Seoul, when riot police fired tear gas to stop some 1,200students trying to march on two campuses.   In Seoul, 2,000 students from three universities battled riotpolice Tuesday at a university campus, shouting anti-government andanti-U.S. slogans. There there were no reports of injuries orarrests.   Prime Minister Lee Hyun-jae on Tuesday promised action after thegoverning Democratic Justice Party called for tighter security toprotect U.S. diplomatic facilities.   The government and opposition parties agreed to form specialcommittees during the National Assembly's first special session inJune to investigate the Kwangju incident and corruption underformer governments.   But Kim Dae-jung's party urged the government and the UnitedStates to study why anti-U.S. protests were increasing and to takesteps to end repressive rule and other unpopular policies.   The recent protests, Kim's party said, were caused by ``U.S.policies that emphasize its own national interests and the (SouthKorean) government's humiliating subservience toward the U.S.''   U.S. officials have consistently denied their government hadanything to do with the nine-day Kwangju uprising, in which about200 people were killed when the army suppressed the protests.Dissidents contend the United States condoned the action and thatSouth Korea covered up the brutality of the soldiers.</TEXT></DOC>
