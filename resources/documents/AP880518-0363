However, Brazilian officials said there was no impasse in thetalks and negotiations were expected to continue later.   Brazil's two main negotiators returned from New York, wheretalks were nearly finished with a committee of 14 banksrepresenting Brazil's 700 creditors.   Sergio Amaral, the international representative for the FinanceMinistry, said talks stalled over the past 10 days due tomisunderstanding over two issues.   He said Brazil wanted to eliminate a condition set by bankersthat the IMF evaluate the Brazilian economy every three months, ashas been the practice.   Also, Brazil wanted to alter a clause in the debt restructuringagreement which states that in the case of default, Brazilianassets abroad may be seized under court order, he said.   Amaral did not explain how specifically Brazil wants to changethe clause or if it wants it taken entirely out of the agreement.   Amaral and Antonio de Padua Seixas were in New York for threeweeks putting the finishing touches on an agreement that wouldallow Brazil to resume interest payments on the debt, thedeveloping world's largest.   Seixas said they left because ``we thought the bankers wouldmake a counter-proposal and they didn't.''   He said the next step before negotiations resumed was for thebankers committee to take Brazil's proposals to creditor banks forreview.   ``This is not an impasse, it is an opportunity to deepen ourunderstanding with bankers,'' Amaral said.   In February 1987, Brazil announced a debt payment moratorium,saying the country was unable to meet monthly interest payments andneeded to restructure its outstanding debt. Brazil made interestpayments in January and February this year after progress in debttalks.   The agreement being worked on includes a $5.8 billion loan tohelp pay part of the interest due from 1987 through 1989.</TEXT></DOC>
