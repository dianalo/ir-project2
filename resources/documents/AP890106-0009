North's defensearsenal may be silenced by the prosecution's decision to drop thetwo central charges against him in the Iran-Contra case.   The ex-Marine's continued demand to include national secrets inthe case was delaying the trial while independent counsel LawrenceE. Walsh fought a rear-guard action with intelligence agencies overthe release of classified information demanded by the court.   Faced with the Reagan administration's refusal to allow moredisclosures of secret information in his own evidence, Walshstreamlined the case Thursday by asking the court to dismiss the twocharges most laden with national security problems.   If as expected U.S. District Judge Gerhard A. Gesell grantsWalsh's motion, the prosecutor will surrender the most politicallyexplosive charges, which allege a criminal conspiracy to divertU.S.-Iran arms-sale profits to the Nicaraguan rebels.   But Laurence Tribe, a constitutional scholar at HarvardUniversity Law School, who has done some legal work for Walsh, sayswhat's left is a ``lean and mean'' set of allegations that Northshredded documents, lied to Congress and obstructed a presidentialinvestigation of the Iran-Contra affair.   Walsh can ``proceed without the cloud of national security''hanging over the remaining charges against the former NationalSecurity Council aide, Tribe said.   The move may also defuse the difficult legal issue raised byNorth's issuance of subpoenas for President Reagan andPresident-elect Bush to testify in court.   That question, unresolved by the courts, could have delayed thetrial for months while White House lawyers fought the summonses allthe way to the Supreme Court.   Without charges he conspired to corrupt Reagan's legitimateeffort to sell arms to free American hostages, North will have aharder time justifying the need to subpoena Reagan and Bush.   ``When those issues are removed, both the need for presidentialtestimony and the need for the great bulk of the documents thatallegedly might compromise national security are radicallyreduced,'' Tribe said.   North can no longer claim that he thought he was acting withpresidential authority when he secretly helped finance theNicaraguan rebel cause with money from the arms-for-hostages deals.   Therefore he has no need to use classified documents to support acontention that his modus operandi in other, authorized, covertoperations was no different from the role he played overseeing thesecret arms network for the Contras.   It is unlikely Gesell would let North claim he thought he wasacting with presidential authority when he shredded NationalSecurity Council documents and lied to Attorney General Edwin MeeseIII during the November 1986 presidential investigation of theIran-Contra affair.   The 12 remaining charges are all felonies that carry penaltiesranging from two to 10 years imprisonment and fines up to $250,000.   ``It's a sad day when we think charges of lying to Congress,obstructing (a presidential inquiry)... and destroying documents aresomehow relatively unimportant,'' Tribe said. ``In the broaderscheme of things those charges should be taken very seriously.''   Some of those charges may still pose some secrecy problems forWalsh, and he may have to jettison a few other counts of theindictment. But it greatly increases the likelihood that the casewill go to trial in the near future.   Tribe said it also reduced the possibility that Reagan wouldreverse his oft-stated position and issue a pardon. ``The need touse a pardon as a means of preserving the alleged confidentiality ofexecutive information is a greatly reduced one.''   Another Harvard University law professor, Alan Dershowitz, saidhe thought dismissal of the two major charges against the retiredMarine colonel will ``make it a lot easier... for North to defendhimself at trial.''   ``He won this battle,'' Dershowitz said. ``It remains to be seenwhether he's gonna win the war.''</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: James Rowley covers the Justice Department for TheAssociated Press and has written about the Iran-Contra case for twoyears.</TEXT></DOC>
