Many of the illegal aliens drown during the three-day voyage.Most who make it ashore later pose as Puerto Ricans to slip pastimmigration officials and board flights to New York.   U.S. Coast Guard and Border Patrol officials in Puerto Rico saythey don't have enough manpower to halt the exodus, which hasincreased sharply in recent months as the Dominican economy worsens.   The Dominican Republic has a population of 6 million, and as manyas 30,000 try to leave each year, officials estimate. They say nomore than 10 percent to 20 percent of Dominicans illegally enteringPuerto Rico are caught. Some 3,000 people were detained in 1988. Therest either make it or drown.   Authorities complain that the problem isn't getting the attentionit deserves because it's happening so far from the U.S. mainland.Puerto Rico, a U.S. commonwealth, is 1,000 miles southeast of Miami.   ``There are human beings dying, and they also pose an economicthreat to the United States; but the consciousness of this iszero,'' said Capt. William A. Caster, head of the Coast Guard'sGreater Antilles Command.   U.S. officials say the Dominican exodus has reached the scale ofHaiti's in 1985, when thousands of boat people were intercepted bythe Coast Guard and hundreds of others washed up on Florida's shores.   ``The only difference is that Haitians were dying off the U.S.coast,'' said Caster, who also led the Haitian operation.   Another difference is that the Coast Guard has an agreement withHaiti allowing the Coast Guard to board Haitian boats to check forillegal aliens. The agreement resulted in the arrest of some 4,000Haitians in 1988.   There is no such accord with the Dominican government, althoughtalks are to start in the new year about signing one.   ``We are focusing on the drug problem, not aliens,'' said Caster.``We don't go out looking for Dominicans. We're coming across themon our patrols and when we do, it invariably turns out to be arescue operation.''   ``The boats are in such bad shape and the people are in so muchdanger, they are thankful to be taken anywhere,'' he said.   Facing 30 percent unemployment rate and 60 percent inflation,Dominicans are lured to the United States in search of jobs and toPuerto Rico because Spanish is spoken here and Puerto Ricans areU.S. citizens. A Dominican who can pass for a Puerto Rican doesn'tneed documents or a passport to fly to New York, where most illegalDominicans end up.   Authorities concede it is easy for Dominicans to get pastimmigration officials at San Juan's airport with a well-rehearsed``New York'' when asked where they're from.   ``There aren't that many differences between the languages andcultures'' of the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico, said JamesWalker, the district director of the Immigration and NaturalizationService. He said more than 1 million Dominicans are in the UnitedStates, most of them illegally.   ``If the family never hears from them, they assume they made itsafely. They don't think anybody drowned,'' said Walker.   About 100 bodies were recovered in a two-month period alone in1988.   ``But we never find the bodies when they drown in the high seas.We suspect there's quite a number though,'' said Joe B. Bennett,chief of the Border Patrol, the federal agency set up a year ago inthe northwest port of Aguadilla where most Dominicans arrive.   Dominicans take on the 90-mile Mona Passage in fragile, woodenfishing boats loaded with up to 80 people. They usually wear no lifejackets or other safety equipment.   ``They don't know the first thing about navigating in the mosthazardous conditions in one of the most dangerous waters of theworld,'' said Bennett.   Clashing winds from the Caribbean and the Atlantic can whip up20-foot swells in the Mona Passage. It's a trip even the Coast Guardand Border Patrol avoid on rough days.   Dominicans sell stoves and refigerators to raise the $500smugglers charge for the journey. The price is $3,000 if a planeticket to New York is included.   Ramon Antonio Sanches, a 30-year-old fisherman recently arrestedoff the cost of Aguadilla, said he sold everything he had for thetrip.   ``If hunger is going to kill me, I prefer to be killedescaping,'' he said. ``What I want to do is work, but there are nojobs at home.''   The Coast Guard patrols 1.3 million square miles with seven largepatrol boats, four smaller boats, four helicopters and three planes.   The Border Patrol has 17 agents and two boats for a 30-milecoastline. Bennett said it would take 200 agents to halt the exodus.</TEXT></DOC>
