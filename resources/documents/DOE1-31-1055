Two types of thin-layer temperature-difference galvaniccells are tested under the same conditions. An ordinary one-layer typetemperature-difference cell is compared with a four-layer type temperature-differencecell. The latter consists of four unit cells connected in series andhas the same volume as the former cell. The total electromotive forceis measured at various temperature differences while the central temperaturein the temperature-difference cell is kept constant at 25{sup 0}C. Resultsshow that the electromotive force of the four-layer type cell is about3.4 times that of the one-layer type cell, though theoretically it shouldbe four times as large. The 16 percent loss is due to incomplete separationbetween each unit temperature-difference cell. The test results haverevealed that a suffiently large electromotive force can be obtainedwith a rather small loss even when several series-connected temperature-differencecells are immersed together in an electrolyte bath.
