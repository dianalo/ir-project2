Over the past few years, the toy-store chain with the backward &quot;R&quot; in its name has confronted hundreds of small U.S. companies -- such as Tots-R-Us and Lamps R Us -- who agree that poor spelling habits can be good for business. Decidedly unflattered, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us has sued dozens of the imitators, contending that they are violating federal trademark law.    &quot;Whether it's 'are' or 'R,' we're going to pursue it,&quot; warns Michael Goldstein, an executive vice president and designated name protector at the Rochelle Park, N.J., concern. The company, which also owns the Kids &quot;R&quot; Us clothing chain, says it has never lost a name-infringement suit.    Only last week, for example, Films R Us bit the dust in federal court here. The Manhattan photography store had been sued in May for creating what Toys &quot;R&quot; Us alleged was &quot;public confusion.&quot; While the toy company didn't win any money in the court settlement, the photo firm did have to change its name. &quot;It's a better name anyway,&quot; says a spokesman for the newly rechristened Clicks andamp; Flicks.    Not every small proprietor backs off, however. &quot;Everyone is running scared except for me,&quot; asserts John Greaux, vice president of family-owned Auto Parts &quot;R&quot; Us in Brooklyn. Mr. Greaux says that if his business loses its name in a court fight, &quot;the judge will have to come here and take the sign down&quot; himself. He also vows that, while Auto Parts &quot;R&quot; Us has never sold toys, &quot;I will sell them if we lose.&quot;    But then, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us could just as easily turn around and sell auto parts someday. Lawyers for the company note that it already claims common-law rights to all business names the &quot;dominant portion of which is the designation 'R Us.'&quot; Court papers cite such specifics as Pools &quot;R&quot; Us and Skates &quot;R&quot; Us, as well as Portraits, Computers, Boys, Babes, Games and Gals &quot;R&quot; Us.    Despite its obvious attachment to the name, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us usually brings its R-infringement suits as Geoffrey Inc., the unit of the company that actually owns the trademark. Geoffrey is named after the company's giraffe mascot -- of which it seems equally protective.    &quot;If someone would do something with the giraffe,&quot; Mr. Goldstein says, &quot;we'd go after that also.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
