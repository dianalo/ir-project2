Neutronmonitoring would provide information on vibration of the thermal shield.The amendment provides for reporting any exceedance of acceptance criteriaand shutdown if the last flexure (upper thermal shield support device)is determined to have broken. The amendment also provides for a mid-cycleinspection of the thermal sheield.The NRC staff has concluded that the monitoring program and mid-cycle inspectionwill provide adequate compensation for the degraded fasteners during thenext operating cycle. The thermal shield attachment mechanism will be fullyrepaired at the end of the cycle, which coincides with the required 10-yearinservice inspection.<T3>The Need for the Proposed Action: </T3>The proposed amendment is requiredto provide for monitoring and inspecting the condition of the reactor vesselthermal shield.<T3>Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Action: </T3>The proposed actionwould not involve a significant change in the probability or consequencesof any accident previously evaluated. The NRC staff has evaluated the proposedamendment and has determined that operation with degraded fasteners isacceptable. If further degradation should occur the thermal shield couldshift position but not in such a way as to cause fuel damage. Consequently,any radiological releases resulting from an accident would not be significantlygreater than previously determined. The proposed amendment does not otherwiseaffect routine radiological plant effluents. Therefore, the Commissionconcludes that there are no significant radiological environmental impactsassociated with the proposed amendment. The Commission also concludes thatthe proposed action will not result in a significant increase in individualor cumulative occupational radiation exposure.With regard to nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendment does notaffect nonradiological plant effluents and has no other environmental impact.Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significant nonradiologicalenvironmental impacts associated with the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 2, 1989 (54 FR 8854). No request forhearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following this notice.<T3>Alternatives to the Proposed Action: </T3>Because the Commission hasconcluded that there are no significant environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed action, there is no need to examine alternatives to theproposed action.<T3>Alternative Use of Resources: </T3>This action does not involve theuse of resources not previously considered in connection with the FinalEnvironmental Statement related to operation of San Onofre Nuclear GeneratingStation, Unit 1, dated October 1973.<T3>Agencies and Persons Consulted: </T3>The NRC staff has reviewed thelicensee's request that supports the proposed amendment. The NRC staffdid not consult other agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludesthat the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated February 17, 1989, as supplemented March 21 and 23, andMay 3, 1989.
