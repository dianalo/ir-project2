(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Donny Osmond, known for sugarcoated songswith sister Marie, has charted a comeback designed to shed hissqueaky-clean image.   The resurrection of his career is off to a fast start with theTop 5 single ``Soldier of Love,'' and Osmond has shed his polyestershirts, favoring a leather jacket, blue jeans, T-shirt and bikerbelt buckle.   A whisker-stubble has replaced the peach fuzz. But Osmond, 31,said in a recent interview that he is still having image troubles.   ``This guy at a radio station in Florida refused to play therecord,'' Osmond recalls. ``I called him and asked, Why? He said,`Because you're a wimp!' So, I gave him as good as I got and weagreed to arm wrestle.   ``If I won, he'd have to play it. I won and he's playing it.''   Osmond even considered changing his name to express his maturity.   ``I started realizing, `What am I hiding?' I think there wouldhave been a bigger backlash associated with a name change than justcoming out and saying, `Look, it's me.' That's why I named thisalbum `Donny Osmond.' You can't get plainer than that,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
