Jones, won'trenominate him to the board when his current term expires inMay.   Northrop said its retirement policy bars nomination ofdirectors after age 70. Mr. Jones is 71. A company spokesmansaid the policy, adopted by a resolution of the board inMarch 1990, wasn't designed to force Mr. Jones off the board.&quot;The policy allowed for a logical and predictable successionat a time when the average age of the board was 70 yearsold,&quot; he said.</LP><TEXT>   Despite Northrop's close identification with Mr. Jones,the announcement of his departure came in a routine pressrelease about the board changes that didn't even mention hisformer titles of chairman and chief executive officer.   Reached at his office here, where he is involved withcharity and conservation fund-raising activities and avineyard operation, Mr. Jones said the mandatory replacementof directors at 70 had had his support as &quot;a logical andgraceful way&quot; to build a younger board for Northrop.   Also retiring as a director is William F. Ballhaus, 73.Northrop said he remained on the board despite his agebecause the mandatory retirement rule went into effect afterhis last re-election.   Mr. Jones's exit from the board brings to an end hissometimes stormy 39-year career at Northrop. He wasconsidered an industry maverick who presided for two decadesover one of the most successful military programs of alltime, the F-5 fighter. Winning the B-2 stealth bombercontract was a major coup, although the program will end farshort of its promise.   Mr. Jones's announcement in April 1989 that he would stepdown as chief executive, after 30 years, came amid questionsabout payments to South Korean businessmen. U.S.investigators charged that the 1984 payments were meant toinduce Seoul to buy F-20 planes. Northrop said the funds werefor a Seoul hotel complex.   But Northrop's executive committee and outside directorsformally reprimanded Mr. Jones over his &quot;management style&quot; inattempting to sell the jet fighters to the Korean government.In September 1990, Mr. Jones resigned as chairman.   Questions about Mr. Jones date back to the 1970s, when hepleaded guilty to a felony count for creating a secretpolitical slush fund for contributions to President Nixon's1972 campaign. Mr. Jones resigned as chairman for a time in1975 after a Northrop report said he had &quot;a heavy share ofthe responsibility&quot; for questionable corporate paymentsabroad.   Since Mr. Jones's retirement as a company officer,Northrop has taken a number of steps to quietly distanceitself from its former leader. Last April, for example, thecompany terminated a consulting contract with Mr. Jones,although he will continue to draw payments under the contractthrough this year.   Among other board changes, Oliver C. Boileau, 64, aNorthrop vice president who is president and general managerof the B-2 stealth bomber division, was elected a director,succeeding F.J. Manzella. His retirement as executive vicepresident was announced in November. Two people werenominated to fill the board vacancies.</TEXT></DOC>
