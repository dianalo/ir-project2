This action will not result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; a major increase in costs or pricesfor consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local governmentagencies or geographic regions; or significant adverse effects on competition,employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability ofUnited States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprisesin domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact Statement</ITAG>This document has been reviewed in accordance with 7 CFR part 1940 subpartG, ``Environmental Program.'' It is the determination of FmHA that theproposed action does not constitute a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment, and in accordance withthe National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, Public Law 91-190, an EnvironmentalImpact Statement is not required.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>This program is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance undernumber 10.422, and is subject to the provisions of Executive Order 12372which requires intergovernmental consultation with State and local officials(7 CFR part 3105, subpart V; 48 FR 29112, June 24, 1983; 49 FR 2267, May31, 1984; 50 FR 14088, April 10, 1985).<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Interim Rule</ITAG>It is the policy of this Department that rules relating to public property,loans, grants, benefits or contracts shall be published for comment notwithstandingthe exemption of 5 U.S.C. 553 with respect to such rules. However, FmHAis making this action effective immediately upon publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> without securing prior public comment. The purposeof this rule is to provide assistance to businesses which have been distressedby natural disasters that have occurred in 1988 or 1989.Especially as a result of drought across most of the country, an emergencysituation exists. This interim rule is a response to an existing situationand, while this Department is reluctant to short circuit prior public comment,it is certain that failure to implement a mandated program at once willresult in significant economic harm to the public.FmHA believes it is essential that this assistance be made available assoon as possible before it is too late for the businesses to recover. Thetypical drought-impacted business in rural communities was only beginningto recover from the serious agricultural and other physical and economicproblems of the preceding decade. Forbearing creditors, aware that anybusiness depends on its customers' economic health, can forbear just solong. Rural businesses and their creditors must plan for the immediateeconomic future. Without immediate implementation of programs of financialassistance, there is no reason to assume the creditors of rural businessesdevastated by the blow to the agricultural and other rural business sectorswill_or can_continue to forbear.The legislative history of Disaster Assistance Act of 1989 (the Act) furtherindicates that many farm related businesses, such as certain small feed-lotoperations, were deemed ineligible for assistance under either the disasterloan provisions administered by the Department of Agriculture or thoseadministered by other Federal agencies. Therefore, in keeping with theintent of the committee, the proposed regulation shall make every effortto assist farm related businesses, ``that are ineligible for other Federaldisaster loan programs, ineligible for disaster loans when these businesseshave suffered drought related losses.''The legislative history of the Act indicates that Congress felt that quickresponse is needed to implement this disaster program in order to alleviatethe effects of the disasters affecting rural businesses. The Congress hasstressed the importance of getting the regulations written and the paymentsmade as quickly as possible.Public comments will be accepted for 60 days and later revisions will bemade to this interim rule if justified on the basis of comments received.This procedure will make assistance available now. The usual course ofa proposed rule, comment period, comment analysis, and a final rule incorporatingchanges would inevitably mean a 60 to 90 day delay in getting assistancewhere it is most needed. Those seeking to comment and make suggestionsfor improvement should be advised that final action will occur as promptlyas possible after the 60 day comment period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Rule</ITAG>FmHA is implementing section 401 of the Disaster Assistance Act of 1989by adding an appendix for this new program at the end of its Business andIndustry loan program. The loan guarantees authorized and implemented bythis action will be called Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprises.These loans will be available to generally the same type of entities asBusiness and Industry loans for generally the same type of loan purposesas Business and Industry loans, through generally the same type of lenders.The major differences between Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprisesand Business and Industry loans are as follows:(1) Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprises loans must assistin alleviating financial distress caused to rural business entities bydrought, freeze, storm, excessive moisture, or related conditions in 1988or 1989 or assist such entities which refinance or restructure debt asthe result of losses incurred because of such natural disasters.(2) Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprises loans for refinancingmay allow an existing lender to bring that part of its existing unguaranteeddebt that has been adversely affected by a disaster under the new guarantee.In no case will the guarantee exceed 90 percent of loan principal and interestor $2.5 million whichever is less.(3) The maximum amount of Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprisesloans to any one borrower is $10,000,000.(4) The maximum loss payment on loans to any one borrower under DisasterAssistance for Rural Business Enterprises loan program is limited to $2,500,000or 90 percent of principal and interest, whichever is less.(5) The requirement for borrower's equity contribution to the businessmay be somewhat smaller for a Disaster Assistance for Rural Business Enterprises(DARBE) guaranteed loan than for a Business and Industry loan, althoughthat equity must be positive and must be such that when considered withother credit factors, repayment of the loan and continued success of thebusiness operation are reasonably assured.(6) DARBE loan proceeds may be used for hotels, motels, tourist and recreationfacilities, and agricultural production (production agriculture) entities.(7) Subsequent DARBE guaranteed loans will not be made due to the maximumloss coverage of $2,500,000.(8) Webster's Ninth New Collegiate dictionary defines production as ``themaking of goods available for use'' and agriculture as ``the science orart of cultivating the soil, producing crops, and raising livestock andin varying degrees the preparation of these products for man's use andtheir disposal.'' It follows then, that agriculture production means cultivatingthe soil, producing crops and raising livestock to make goods, and productionagriculture means the making of goods through cultivating the soil, producingcrops and raising livestock. FmHA has concluded that there is no substantialdifference in meaning between the terms agriculture production as usedin its regulations for Bandamp;I guaranteed loans and production agriculture.Additionally, this definition appears to fulfill Congress's concern asexpressed in the legislative history of the Act that certain businesseshave been precluded guarantee assistance in other programs. Accordingly,FmHA has adopted this definition coupled with the provise that entitiesinvolved in agricultural production are eligible for DARBE assistance solong as these entities are not eligible for other assistance under farmerprogram loans. FmHA feels the exclusion from DARBE assistance of projectseligible under farmer program loans is reasonable because assistance willstill be rendered but under a program which has a larger financial assistanceresources than DARBE. In addition, DARBE should not duplicate existingFmHA programs.Generally, except where the Disaster Assistance Act mandates otherwise,FmHA has sought to minimize differences between these loans and businessand Industry loans so that field staff, lenders, and other already familiarwith Bandamp;I guaranteed loans will be able to handle these loans withoutany significant training or research. This will expedite the provisionof needed assistance.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 1980</ITAG>Loan Programs_Business and industry_Rural development assistance, Ruralareas.Accordingly, title 7, chapter XVIII, of the Code of Federal Regulationsis amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 1980_GENERAL</ITAG>1.

A proposed method of making the maximum collection possible onthe indebtedness.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">4. If the outstanding principal Bandamp;I loan balance including accruedinterest is less than $200,000, the Lender will obtain an estimate of themarket and potential liquidated value of the collateral. On Bandamp;I loanbalances in excess of $200,000, and all other loans regardless of the outstandingprincipal balance, the Lender will obtain an independent appraisal reporton all collateral securing the loan, which will reflect the current marketvalue and potential liquidation value. The appraisal report is for thepurpose of permitting the Lender and FmHA to determine the appropriateliquidation actions. Any independent appraiser's fee will be shared equallyby FmHA and the Lender.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. FmHA's response to Lender's liquidation plan.

When the Lender is conducting the liquidation, and owns any ofthe guaranteed portion of the loan, it may request a tentative loss estimateby submitting to FmHA an estimate of loss that will occur in connectionwith liquidation of the loan. FmHA will agree to pay an estimated losssettlement to the Lender provided the Lender applies such amount due tothe outstanding principal balance owed on the guaranteed debt. Such estimatewill be prepared and submitted by the Lender on Form FmHA 449-30, usingthe basic formula as provided on the report except that the appraisal valuewill be used in lieu of the amount received from the sale of collateral.For Farm Ownership, Soil and Water, and Operating loans only, if it appearsthe liquidation period will exceed 90 days, the Lender will file an estimatedloss claim. Once this claim is approved by FmHA, the Lender will discontinueinterest accrual on the defaulted loan and the loss claim will be promptlyprocessed in accordance with the applicable FmHA regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After the Report of Loss estimate has been approved by FmHA, and within30 days thereafter, FmHA will send the original Report of Loss estimateto FmHA Finance Office for issuance of a Treasury check in payment of theestimated amount due the Lender.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">After liquidation has been completed, a final loss report will besubmitted on Form FmHA 449-30 by the Lender to FmHA.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3.
