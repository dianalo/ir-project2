The 22-count indictment named NEC's Japan AviationElectronics Industry Ltd. and Aero Systems Inc. of Miami asthe principals in an alleged conspiracy to transfer more than$7 million in navigational equipment for the F-4 Phantomfighter to Iran between 1984 and 1987, when it was at warwith Iraq.</LP><TEXT>   U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens said the shipments &quot;contributedsubstantially&quot; to Iran's ability to keep the planes inaction. The U.S.-made fighters were acquired by Iran beforeits 1979 takeover by Shiite fundamentalists.   Yesterday's indictment also cited three Aero Systemsunits, three Japan Aviation employees and a former executiveand a former sales agent for Aero Systems.   The indictment is the latest development in a rapidlyunfolding Japanese scandal that already has resulted in thearrest of four JAE officials on charges of violating Japan'strade laws. One of those four was also among the individualsindicted by the federal grand jury. The scandal has had anunusual political impact in Japan because of Tokyo'slongstanding prohibition against the export of arms.   Mr. Stephens said the JAE case may be the first allegedviolation of the U.S. arms export control law by a majorJapanese supplier. If convicted, JAE could be fined as muchas $22 million. It also could face a more serious penalty ofbeing barred from purchasing U.S. technology or receivingcontracts with the federal government, he said.   The indictment alleges that JAE illegally manufactured thenavigational gear for Aero Systems' Hong Kong and Singaporesubsidiaries, knowing that those parts would be reshipped toIran. JAE had a license from Litton Systems Inc., a unit ofLitton Industries Inc., to make those parts for F-4's boughtby Japan, but couldn't supply them to any other countrywithout the State Department authorization.   The grand jury also charged that F-4 gyroscopes that JAEacquired through a valid license from Honeywell Inc. wereillegally resold to Iran through the Aero Systems units.Neither Litton nor Honeywell was involved in any wrongdoing,Mr. Stephens said, praising both U.S. contractors, as well asthe Japanese government, for cooperating with theinvestigation.   Aero Systems didn't respond to calls for comment on theindictment. NEC, which owns 50.2% of JAE, has disclaimed anyknowledge of the Iran shipments.   Another Japanese electronics giant, Toshiba Corp., ismarginally involved in this case. Mr. Stephens said thatToshiba was the direct licensee for some of the U.S.technology involved, and that it had subcontracted thebusiness to JAE. Toshiba wasn't charged with any wrongdoing,though Mr. Stephens said it may have to confront certain&quot;administrative&quot; issues.   In the late 1980s, Toshiba was involved in anexport-control scandal when one of its units was discoveredto have shipped milling machines to a Soviet submarine yardin violation of the Western alliance's export controls.</TEXT></DOC>
