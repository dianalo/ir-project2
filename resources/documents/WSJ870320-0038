Currently, partnerships that are formed specifically to complete such acquisitions often can acquire large blocks of shares in target companies without disclosing the purchases. They also don't have to provide the Justice Department or the Federal Trade Commission with information about their intentions and the likely competitive impact of the proposed transactions.    The Senate Judiciary antitrust subcommittee yesterday approved by voice vote a measure to include partnerships in the filing requirements under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act. But subcommittee Chairman Howard Metzenbaum (D., Ohio) indicated he would drop his push to close the loophole if the FTC adopts a regulation accomplishing the same thing.    &quot;If the (Reagan) administration acts and achieves the same result, so be it,&quot; Sen. Metzenbaum said. &quot;But they have a way to go.&quot; The FTC has proposed a rule to narrow the loophole, but Sen. Metzenbaum said the proposal wouldn't cover all partners that might launch a takeover bid.    The legislation is designed to prevent raiders from launching takeovers without pre-merger notification. The measure is expected to be passed by the full committee. </TEXT></DOC>
