And a story it was, with only mythical justification and naive faith in conventional U.S. wisdom concerning agricultural chemicals. I question whether any of the alleged perils you referred to are real or significant, but instead are simply extensions of our U.S. mania over technology.    I am delighted that our Mexican friends have become a major exporter of food to the U.S. and am pleased, too, with its quality. Pesticides are, no doubt, a significant factor in the abundance as well as the quality. In contrast, our politically motivated EPA regulations have become a major contributor to the ills of our domestic agriculture and to the sad prospect of our loss of world leadership in food and fiber production.    The very last thing I would want anyone to do would be to blindly follow the dictates of our politicized EPA, whose motivations stem from the urging of our environmentalist drones, egged on by irresponsible segments of the media.    I.W. Tucker   President, National Council   for Environmental Balance   Louisville, Ky.   ---   Since 1974 Mexico has had a rigorous law with criminal penalties to control the use of pesticides.    Abiding by the guidelines of the World Health Organization and the U.N. Food and Agricultural Organization, and in accord with the results from the Mexican National Institute of Agricultural Research, a list of authorized agrochemicals is elaborated every year. The Secretariat of Health publishes a Manual of Pesticide Tolerances that is distributed throughout the country to everyone involved in the use of pesticides, public and private. Likewise, permanent training and educational programs are organized. The tendency is to rationalize the use of agrochemicals within acceptable productivity levels. Other methods are developed, such as genetic, cultural and quarantine controls.    In addition, there is permanent communication with authorities of other countries. In the U.S. with the EPA, USDA and FDA, for example, the quality of lab analysis is checked by exchange of samples and verification of results; Mexican technicians are trained by the FDA, and permanent communication is maintained with regard to illegal residue.    The GAO report (Sept. 1986) quoted in your article, found that during 1979-85 &quot;. . . the overall violation rate for Mexican imports has been lower than the rate for other importing countries . . .&quot;; also &quot;The Los Angeles district took 596 samples of imported Mexican tomatoes in fiscal 1985. Again only one sample was found to be adulterated.&quot; And the report also recognizes that &quot;Significant amounts of information have been obtained from Mexico . . .&quot; regarding pesticide use.    Erroneously, the article applies to Mexico conclusions that are valid for some Third World countries, such as the opinion of Agi Kiss (consultant of the World Bank), quoted in the article, who told us subsequently that &quot;I was not specifically refering to Mexico; I have never been to Mexico.&quot;    Mexico is as rigorous as the most advanced countries in the regulation of the use of pesticides, protecting the health of farm workers as well as that of domestic and foreign consumers.    Alfonso Ayala   Agricultural Counselor   Embassy of Mexico   Washington   ---   I have worked on agricultural projects in 59 countries and have found that in the overwhelming majority of the cases, poor Third World farmers who are meticulously counting every baht of expense cannot and do not apply inordinately large amounts of the wrong chemical to the wrong crop. In the cases I have observed, they are much more cautious and knowledgeable about their particular crops than is the average American farmer.    Larry Grupp   Moscow, Idaho</TEXT></DOC>
