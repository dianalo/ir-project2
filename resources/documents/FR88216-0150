This action has become necessary due to an increase in the numberof vessels being accepted for transit by Canal authorities when their lengthexceeds that permitted by current regulations. The effect will be to recognizethe increasing growth in size of commercial vessels by permitting themtransit on a regular basis, thereby conforming regulations to the practicethat has developed.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Written comments should be submitted on or before March17, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should be sent to Secretary, Panama CanalCommission, 2000 ``L'' Street NW, Suite 550, Washington DC 20036-4996 orPanama Canal Commission, Office of General Counsel, APO Miami, Florida34011-5000.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Michael Rhode, Jr., Secretary,Panama Canal Commission, telephone: (202) 634-6441, or Mr. John Haines,Jr., General Counsel, Balboa Heights, Republic of Panama, telephone: 011-507-52-7511.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Present Commission regulations in 35CFR 103.6(e)(1) restrict regular transits to (1) commercial vessels whoseoverall maximum length, including bulbous bow, does not exceed 900 feet,and (2) to passenger and container ships whose overall length does notexceed 950 feet. Depending on their characteristics, vessels exceedingthese limits have been authorized single transits at the discretion ofCanal authorities, subject to special conditions to ensure the safety andcontinuity of regular Canal operations. There has been a gradual increasein the number of exceptions granted to vessels that exceed the limitationsset forth above and recurring requests for these vessels to transit ona regular basis, without the need for authorization for individual transits.A study of Canal operating procedures indicates that an increase in maximumlength by 50 feet, from 900 feet to 950 feet may be acceptable on certaincommercial vessels. Similarly, an increase of 15 feet, from 950 feet to965 feet is considered acceptable for transit of passenger and containerships.In view of this determination, therefore, the Commission proposes to reviseparagraph (e)(1) of andSection; 103.6 to permit the Commission to acceptfor regular transit commercial vessels whose maximum length overall, includingbulbous bow, is 950 feet, except that passenger and container ships maybe 965 feet in overall length. To insure a safe passage, vessels greaterthan 900 feet in length overall, which are transiting for the first timeor are newly-modified vessels or newly-constructed vessels are subjectto denial of passage pursuant to andSection; 103.2 and to the requirementof prior review and approval of vessel plans by Canal authorities.The Commission has determined that this rule does not constitute a majorrule within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 dated February 17, 1981(47 FR 13193). The bases for that determination are, first, that the rule,when implemented, would not have an annual effect on the economy of $100million or more per year, and second, that the rule would not result ina major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,local governmental agencies or geographic regions.Further, the agency has determined that implementation of the rule willhave no adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation or the ability of United States based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Finally, the Commission has determined that this rule is not subject tothe requirements of sections 603 and 604 of Title 5, United States Code,in that its promulgation will not have a significant impact on a substantialnumber of small entities, and the Administrator of the Commission so certifiespursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 35 CFR Part 103</ITAG>Panama Canal, Vessels, Marine safety, Navigation.Accordingly, it is proposed to amend Title 35, Code of Federal Regulations,Part 103, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 103_GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING VESSELS</ITAG>1.
