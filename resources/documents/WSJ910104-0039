The company declined to say how much of the estimatedvalue is made up of firm orders, and one Wall Street analystwarned against viewing the seemingly huge contract as abonanza for Allied-Signal.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There are a lot of questions about the size and successof the Boeing 777 program,&quot; said Tassos Philippakos, ananalyst at Moody's Investors Service Inc. He said the Boeing777, which will have a passenger capacity of 360 to 390people, will make its debut in a highly competitive market in1995 and the number of 777s finally built may turn out to bemuch smaller than currently expected.   &quot;I don't see the contracts having any material effect onAllied-Signal's bottom line,&quot; he said.   An Allied-Signal spokesman declined to say how many 777planes are represented by the $1 billion in Boeing contracts.   Allied-Signal said the contracts call for its GarrettAuxiliary Power Division in Phoenix, Ariz., to supply theauxiliary power system for the aircraft. The company put thevalue of this contract at $530 million. Deliveries arescheduled to start in 1994.   The company's AiResearch Group in Torrance, Calif., willdevelop and supply a new air supply control system and cabinpressure control system for the plane. Allied-Signal said thepotential value of this contract is about $500 million.   The contracts will be spread over 10 to 15 years, theAllied-Signal spokesman said.   Mr. Philippakos, the analyst, estimated that given thenumber of years the contracts would be spread over and theuncertainty about the size of the market, the contracts wouldgenerate $100 million in annual revenue for Allied-Signal atthe peak of the plane's production. &quot;This aircraft will havemuch more competition than Boeing faced on its other planesin the past,&quot; he said, referring to other entries in thatmarket from the four-nation European consortium AirbusIndustrie, and McDonnell Douglas Corp.</TEXT></DOC>
