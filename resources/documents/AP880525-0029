Geographically and historically, neutral Finland sees itself asthe no-man's land between East and West.   It also has great saunas, as the president may have heard fromGeorge Shultz. The secretary of state has made four rest stops inHelsinki in less than three years on his way to Moscow, andreportedly has become an enthusiast of the traditional Finnishsweat bath.   Reagan is scheduled to arrive in Helsinki early Thursdaymorning, and will spend three nights there recovering from jet lagand preparing for his May 29-June 2 summit with Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev.   In his only scheduled activities outside his regular Saturdayradio address, Reagan will meet Friday with President MaunoKoivisto and then address Finnish leaders on human rights.   He will speak in Finlandia Hall, where 35 heads of state signedthe 1975 Helsinki Accords on military security, economiccooperation and humanitarian issues.   American Jewish leaders have announced they will hold a vigil inHelsinki during Reagan's stay to draw attention to the demands bySoviet Jews for freedom to emigrate.   Though Reagan probably won't see much of the city, Helsinki'sRussian flavor offers him a taste of things to come. With itstrolley cars, broad avenues and 19th century buildings, the cityhas been used as a set for ``Gorky Park'' and other movies aboutRussia.   Most of Helsinki was devastated by fire in 1808, the same yearSweden ended its 600-year rule of Finland and ceded the territoryto Russia. It was a Russian duchy until 1917.   Finland's life in Russia's shadow has been the theme of itspolitics for centuries. It shares a 793-mile border with the SovietUnion, the longest of any non-communist state.   The Finns like to say they were ``defeated, but not conquered''by the Soviets in World War II, since they retained an independentgovernment and parliament. But they were forced to cede territory,pay reparations and sign a Treaty of Cooperation and Friendship.   Their post-war caution toward the Soviets gave rise to the term``Finlandization'' as a synonym for obsequiousness in a country'sforeign policy.   ``With all my heart, I would like that word to be abolished,''Prime Minister Harri Holkeri said with uncharacteristic angerduring a Washington news conference last month.   Holkeri, who took office in April 1987, is the first primeminister from the Conservative Party since the war. Before lastyear, the party was frozen out of government in deference to Moscowbecause of its staunchly anti-Soviet image.   Finns defend their policy by saying they are nobody's lackey.   ``Having for long felt themselves to be menaced by the East andlet down by the West, the Finnish people today feel they aregetting the best of both worlds,'' writes Max Jakobson, a formerFinnish ambassador to the United Nations.   ``The supreme test for Finland has been to find a way to live inpeace with her powerful neighbor without giving up her own systemof government and her ties with the Western world,'' Jakobson wrotein ``Finland: Myth and Reality'' published last year.   During the last year Finland has increasingly turned away fromthe Soviets and more toward Western Europe.   In April, it decided to join the Council of Europe, which itonce saw as an instrument of the Cold War. Finland had been theonly major non-communist European country to stay outside thecouncil, which monitors human rights in Europe.   Trade with the Soviets dropped from 25 percent of Finland'stotal two years ago to 15 percent last year. More than 60 percentof Finland's trade is with Western Europe, and about five percentis with the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
