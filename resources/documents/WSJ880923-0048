Inc., underscoring the continued advances in electronic imaging, introduced a new electronic still-image camera that allows users to view their pictures instantly on a television.    The Canon RC-250, which will have a suggested retail price of about $1,000, uses a miniature magnetic disk instead of film to record images, so no processing is required. As many as 50 images can be recorded on a two-inch magnetic floppy disk, and each image can be erased and replaced with new pictures. The camera, which also features Hi-Band recording for good image quality, connects to a TV set with a single cable for playback.    Canon, which two years ago introduced an electronic still-image camera for industrial use, noted that its latest model will sell for one-fifth the price. &quot;This offers the industrial version's advantage of instant playback on a television, but at a price consumers can easily afford,&quot; said Fujio Mitarai, president of Canon U.S.A., which is a unit of Tokyo-based Canon Inc.    Some competitors in the photography industry are expected to soon follow Canon's lead in the electronic still-image market. Casio Computers Inc. of Japan has already announced plans for a similarly priced camera.    Still, the market for the camera is likely to be small, industry observers believe, and many companies won't feel the need to rush with their own models. &quot;If you're a consumer with $1,000 to drop on this kind of a toy, chances are you want a camcorder, which gives you images on TV, plus sound and motion,&quot; noted Michael Ellmann, a photography industry analyst at Wertheim andamp; Co. By comparison, &quot;consumers' appetite for looking at still photographs on a TV set is very low,&quot; he added. &quot;There's a good reason the neighbor with the slide projector is considered a bore.&quot;    In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Canon Inc.'s American depositary receipts dropped $1.125 to $52.625.    Canon's new camera -- which allows users to take a picture, display it immediately and transmit it by telephone to a third party -- should appeal to news-gathering and crime-detection organizations. Businesses that want to offer electronic slide shows at management meetings may also snap it up.    But the camera doesn't have as high a resolution quality as traditional slides, or hard-copy print capability, analysts note. &quot;The ideal product is an electronic camera selling for $300 to $500 that can be plugged into a TV but also has high enough resolution to generate high-quality prints,&quot; says Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. That technological advance is &quot;about five years away,&quot; he believes.    Canon, which plans to begin selling the electronic camera in January 1989, won't disclose details of its planned advertising campaign for the new product, but says it plans to market it &quot;not as a replacement camera but as a complement to camcorders and film-based photography. The company added that it will launch a &quot;full-blown campaign&quot; early next year, with newspaper, magazine and television ads. </TEXT></DOC>
