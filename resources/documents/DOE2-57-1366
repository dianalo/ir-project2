In the present report alternativeways of meeting the energy demand are pointed out, by using natural gas,biomass, energy conservation, heat pumps and solar energy. These alternativesmay be used to substitute parts of the electric power and the oil consumption.An analysis is given of alternative energy scenarios for the year 2000,and their consequences with regard to effluent reductions and energycosts. It is also examined how gas power most favorably can be fit intothe Norwegian energy supply system to meet the peak load requirements.25 refs., 2 figs., 7 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
