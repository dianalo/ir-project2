<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-05-0302 </DOCNO><TEXT>The most likely volcanic source rock for uranium in epigenetic depositsof the Tallahassee Creek uranium district and nearby areas is the WallMountain Tuff. The widespread occurrence of the Tuff, its high apparentoriginal uranium content, {similar_to}11 ppm, and its apparent loss ofuranium from devitrification and other alteration suggest its role inproviding that element. An estimate of the original Th/U ratio is basedon the present thorium and uranium contents of the basal vitrophyre ofthe Tuff from Castle Rock Gulch, Hecla Junction, and other areas. TheGribbles Park Tuff also could have supplied substantial amounts of uranium.Its presently high thorium content suggests an original uranium contentsimilar to that of the Wall Mountain Tuff, but little data are availableupon which to base an estimated Th/U ratio. The remaining units thatwere evaluated include the lower member of the Thirtynine Mile Andesiteand related rocks, the Badger Creek Tuff, the Antero Formation, the GribblesPark Tuff, and the Thorn Ranch Tuff. 36 refs.; 8 figs.; 9 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
