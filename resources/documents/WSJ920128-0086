Hinson, who presided over both the growth anddemise of Midway Airlines, was named executive vicepresident, marketing and business development, of McDonnellDouglas Corp.'s commercial jet division.   The 58-year-old executive assumed essentially the same jobat the Douglas Aircraft Co. unit held until September byRussell L. Ray Jr. Mr. Ray, 56, left to become chiefexecutive of Pan Am Corp.'s Pan American World Airways, whichwas forced to shut down last month.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Hinson, who took up his duties at the Long Beach,Calif.-based unit yesterday, oversees marketing and sales ofMcDonnell Douglas's family of commercial jets, includingmodel MD-80 and MD-90 twin jets and the MD-11 wide body. Heis also charged with launching sales of two new aircraft, theMD-12 jumbo jet and the MD-95, a 100-passenger successor tothe DC-9.   The success of the MD-12, a new generation jumbo jetdesigned to travel 9,000 miles nonstop, is crucial tocompletion of Taiwan Aerospace Corp.'s proposed investment inDouglas. The Taiwanese company has signed a tentativeagreement to buy up to 40% of McDonnell Douglas's commercialjet business. Another challenge will be to bolster Douglas'sorder book, which analysts said showed more cancellationsthan new orders last year.   In an interview, Mr. Hinson confirmed that the MD-12program &quot;is one of my top priorities.&quot; And, &quot;to the degreethat orders and options have slipped, that poses a realchallenge and we'll have to deal with it. . . . This seems tobe a cyclical situation. Since I was 19 years old, I've neverseen a stable order book&quot; in a weak economy, he said.   Mr. Hinson was elected chairman and chief executive ofMidway Airlines in 1985 after the Chicago-based regionalairline had two consecutive years of losses. He soon helpedreturn Midway to profitability and charted a course forgrowth.   But the airline bit off more than it could chew two yearsago, when an ambitious plan to open a hub in Philadelphiafailed. Further weakened by the recession, the airline filedfor bankruptcy-law protection in March. When an offer to buythe airline fell through in November, Midway stopped flyingand Mr. Hinson left after a bankruptcy trustee was appointed.   From 1973 until joining Midway, Mr. Hinson managed aprivate business that owned a Beech aircraft distributorship,among other interests. He held various management posts at amedium-sized airline on the West Coast during part of the1960s after several years as a pilot for Northwest Airlines.   In other announcements, St. Louis-based McDonnell Douglassaid John N. Feren, 36, was named to the newly created postof vice president, commercial marketing and contracts, of thecommercial jet division. Ronald R. Wasikowski, 47, vicepresident, commercial marketing for the Americas region, wasgiven additional responsibilities for regions in the Pacificand Asia. Both men report to Mr. Hinson, a company spokesmansaid.   ---   Brett Pulley contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
