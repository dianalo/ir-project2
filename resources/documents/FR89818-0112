The regulations establish such apermit system to designate Specially Protected Areas and Sites of SpecialScientific Interest. Additional information was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on July 17, 1989. The applications received areas follows:<ITAG tagnum="84">1. <T4>Applicant </T4></ITAG>Mark A. Chappell, Department of Biology, University of California, Riverside,Riverside, CA 92521.<ITAG tagnum="84">Activity for Which Permit Requested</ITAG>Taking, import into U.S. The applicant is conducting a study of the physiologicalcondition of seabirds breeding near Palmer Station, Antarctica, in relationto the effects of the recent oilspill there. The applicant will collectstomach content and blood samples form Adelie penguins (140); blue-eyedshags (10); southern giant petrels (10); and South Polar skuas (10). Thesespecimens will be released after samples are taken. Up to five Adelie penguinswill be sacrificed for calibration of body composition measurements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Location</ITAG>Palmer Station, Antarctic Peninsula vicinity.<ITAG tagnum="84">Dates</ITAG>October 1989_March 1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">2. <T4>Applicant</T4></ITAG>Richard Rivkin, Horn Point Environmental Laboratories, University of Maryland,Cambridge, MD 21613.<ITAG tagnum="84">Activity for Which Permit Requested</ITAG>Introduction of non-indigenous species into Antarctica. The applicant proposesto study the nutrition of planktonic larvae produced by marine benthicinvertebrates (asteroids and echinoids). Larvae survival on particulatefood, dissolved organic food and/or yolk provided by the parents will beinvestigated.The study requires algal cultures to rear mass cultures of larvae to determinefood preference and grazing characteristics. Six non-indigenous speciesof algae are required to feed lavaral cultures for nutritional studies.The six species are: Synechococcus, Dunaliella, Skeletonema, Isochrysis,Thalassiosira, and Nannochoris. Cultures of indigenous species of algaewill also be established and used to feed larvae for grazing preferenceand characteristics.All cultures will be maintained in enclosed incubators at the Eklund BiologicalLaboratory. Larvae will be reared within the Aquarium Building at McMurdo.Non-indigenous species of algae will not be released in the environment.All non-indigenous species will be destroyed (heat killed by autoclaving)at the end of the study. Cultures of indigenous species of algae will betransported back to the U.S.A. (University of Maryland) to study physiologicalcharacteristics of the antarctic algae.<ITAG tagnum="84">Location</ITAG>McMurdo Station, Antarctica.<ITAG tagnum="84">Dates</ITAG>October 1989_January 1990.<ITAG tagnum="6">Charles E.
