Background</ITAG>On September 19, 1986, the Department, in conjunction with the InternalRevenue Service and Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, published inthe <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 33500) proposed changes to the Form 5500Series. On January 2, 1987, the Department published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(52 FR 84) proposed amendments to the annualreporting regulations (Part 2520 of Chapter XXV of Title 29 of the Codeof Federal Regulations) which, in part, were necessary to implement certainof the proposed changes to the Form 5500 Series. A number of technicalamendments to the regulations were also proposed in order to update certainof the reporting and disclosure regulations, as well as to eliminate duplicationof information also appearing in the instructions to the Form 5500 Series.The Form 5500 Series, as modified by the Agencies, is published in thesame separate part of today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4>The amendments published on January 2, 1987, were proposed to be effectivefor reporting for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 1987, tocoincide with the implementation of revisions to the Form 5500 Series forthe 1987 plan year. Subsequent to the publication of the proposed amendments,the Department, in conjunction with the Internal Revenue Service and PensionBenefit Guaranty Corporation, decided to defer forms revisions to the 1988plan year filing cycle. Accordingly, the amendments contained herein willbe effective for reporting for plan years beginning on or after January1, 1988, to coincide with forms revisions implemented for the 1988 planyear filing cycle.As discussed in more detail below, the Department received only three commentsrelating to the proposed amendments to the annual reporting regulations,and the Department has decided to adopt those amendments in the form proposed,except as otherwise noted.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Description of Amendments</ITAG>Sections 2520.103-1 and 2520.103-2Section 2520.103-1 describes the content of the Form 5500. The Departmentis adopting the following amendments to andSection;2520.103-1. (1) Amendparagraph (a)(2) to delete the reference to andSection;2520.104b-11, whichprescribed the summary annual report requirements for plans which constitutea group insurance arrangement. Section 2520.104b-11 was superseded by andSection;2520.104b-10pursuant to notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(44 FR 19403) on April 3, 1979. (2) Amend paragraph(b) to delete references to specific line items on the Form 5500 Seriesin order to avoid future regulation amendments solely to accommodate minoritem changes to the forms. (3) Amend paragraphs (b) and (c) to add a referenceto Schedule C, the proposed schedule for reporting service provider, trustee,and certain service provider termination information (<T3>see </T3>revised Form 5500 Series in the same separate part of today's<T4>Federal Register</T4>). And, (4) amend paragraphs (c), (d), and (e)to eliminate references to the Form 5500-K, which was eliminated as a reportingform for plan years beginning after December 31, 1983 (<T3>see </T3>Internal Revenue Service Release 84-71, June 18, 1984).\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\Form 5500-K was the Return/Report of Employee Benefit Planfor Sole Proprietorships and Partnerships. The Tax Equity and Fiscal ResponsibilityAct of 1982 (Pub. L. 97-248, 96 Stat. 324 (1982)) repealed most of thespecial limitations and restrictions on the design and operation of theseKeogh plans, resulting in these plans having the same contribution, deduction,and vesting requirements, and similar coverage requirements, as other plans.These plans are now required to file either Form 5500-C or Form 5500-R.Section 2520.103-2 describes the contents of the Form 5500 for plans whichconstitute a group insurance arrangement, as defined in andSection;2520.104-43.Paragraph (b) of andSection;2520.103-2 is amended to eliminate the referencesto specific line items on the Form 5500, consistent with the amendmentsto andSection;2520.103-1.Section 2520.103-6Section 2520.103-6 sets forth the definition of reportable transactionsfor the Form 5500. The Department is amending paragraph (b)(1)(ii) to deletethe reference to a specific line item on the Form 5500 Series.Under paragraph (c) of andSection; 2520.103-6, a reportable transaction isdefined as any transaction or series of transactions involving an amountin excess of 3 percent of the current value of a plan's assets.\2\<NOTE/> The Department is amending paragraph (c) of andSection; 2520.103-6by adding a new subparagraph (c)(4) which raises the threshold for reportabletransactions from 3 percent to 5 percent for plan years beginning on orafter January 1, 1988. This amendment is necessary to implement the increasein the threshold for reportable transactions from 3 percent to 5 percenton the revised Form 5500 Series (<T3>see</T3> in the same separate part of today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ <T3>See</T3> section 103(b)(3)(H) of ERISA.The Department also is modifying the examples set forth in paragraph (e)of andSection; 2520.103-6 to reflect the change from 3 percent to 5 percent.This amendment is being adopted in accordance with the authority grantedthe Secretary under sections 104(a)(3) and 110, pursuant to which utilizationof the Form 5500 under andSection; 2520.103-1 constitutes a limited exemptionfor welfare plans and an alternative method of compliance for pension plans.The findings required under section 104(a)(3) and section 110 with respectto the use of the Form 5500 as a limited exemption and alternative methodof compliance are discussed below.Section 2520.103-10Section 2520.103-10 describes the format and content of the financial schedulesincluded as part of the Form 5500. The Department is amending andSection;2520.103-10 as follows: (1) Delete the references to specific line items(e.g., item 22) in order to avoid the necessity of future amendments tothe regulations to accommodate minor changes in the forms; and (2) in aneffort to eliminate duplication, delete the schedule formats and othergeneral explanatory information appearing in the regulation which alsoappears in the instructions to the forms.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ For clarification purposes, the regulation continues tospecify certain transactions with a party-in-interest that are not requiredto be reported on that schedule. In this respect, it should be noted that,although the form does not require the reporting of publicly traded securitiestransactions involving a party-in-interest, such transactions are not inall cases exempt from the prohibited transaction provisions of section406 of ERISA.The Department had proposed an amendment to andSection; 2520.103-10 thatwould add a reference to the Form 5500-C to accommodate a proposed changeto the Form 5500-C requiring plans with 26 to 99 participants to file aschedule of loans and leases in default (<T3>see</T3> proposed revisions to the Form 5500 Series, 51 FR 33500).Under the revised Form 5500 Series being adopted by the Agencies (<T3>see</T3> in the same separate part of today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>), plans filing the Form 5500-C will not be requiredto file a schedule of loans and leases in default. Accordingly, the Departmentis not adopting this amendment.Section 2520.104-41Section 2520.104-41 provides a simplified method of annual reporting forplans with fewer than 100 participants. Paragraph (c)(2) of that sectionrequires administrators of Keogh plans to file the Form 5500-K. Becausethe Form 5500-K has been eliminated as an annual reporting form, andSection;2520.104-41 is being amended to delete paragraph (c)(2) in its entirety.Section 2520.104b-10Section 2520.104b-10 sets forth the requirements for the summary annualreport and prescribes the formats for such reports. Included as an appendixto the regulation is a cross-reference guide which corresponds the lineitems of the summary annual report formats to the line items on the Forms5500 and 5500-C to facilitate completion. This document includes a revisedappendix which takes into account the changes to the revised Form 5500Series being adopted by the Agencies.Section 2520.104-46Section 2520.104-46 provides a waiver of the examination and report ofan independent qualified public accountant for employee benefit plans withfewer than 100 participants. This section is being amended to delete thereference to Form 5500-K appearing in paragraph (d).Address Corrections to Reporting RegulationsSince the publication of many of the reporting regulations, the Officeof Pension and Welfare Benefit Programs has changed its name to the Pensionand Welfare Benefits Administration, pursuant to Secretary of Labor's OrderNo. 1-86. In addition, the agency has changed the room for receipt of documentsrequired to be filed under Title I of ERISA with the Department. In orderto facilitate the filing and receipt of documents, the Department is amendingthe following sections to provide an updated address: andSection;andSection;2520.104-22(c); 2520.104-23(c); 2520.014a-3(d), and 2520.104a-4(c).<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Discussion of Comments</ITAG>The Department received three comment letters concerning the proposed amendmentsto the annual reporting regulations. Two of the letters contained commentsrelating to andSection;2520.103-6. One of the commentators suggested thatraising the reportable transaction threshold from 3 percent to 5 percentwould permit, in the case of a plan with substantial assets, transactionsinvolving a significant amount of assets to go unreported. The commentatoralso recommended that the dates of reportable transactions be requiredto be reported. The Department recognizes that by increasing the reportabletransaction threshold from 3 percent to 5 percent, certain transactionsheretofore required to be reported will go unreported. However, the Departmenthas concluded, on the basis of its enforcement experience over the pastten years, that the disclosure of 5 percent transactions will enable itto identify transactions that are sufficiently large to suggest that fiduciarymisconduct may be involved and, therefore will provide adequate reportingto the Department. For the same reason, the Department believes that the5 percent threshold will provide adequate disclosure to plan participantsand beneficiaries. It is also noted that the 5 percent threshold is consistentwith the threshold under generally accepted accounting principles for identifying``significant'' investments, which are required to be reported on the financialstatements of plans. Accordingly, the Department has decided to adopt the5 percent threshold criteria for reportable transactions. The Departmentalso has decided not to require the dates of reportable transactions tobe reported. The Department believes that sufficient information concerningreportable transactions is required to be reported, without transactiondates, to apprise the Department and plan participants and beneficiariesof potential abuses. Moreover, because the report is required to be filedannually, the specific date of a particular transaction is of less significance.The other commentator recommended that the definition of a reportable transactionunder andSection; 2520.103-6 be amended to exclude the following transactionsinvolving pooled separate accounts maintained by insurance companies: (a)New employer deposits; (b) transfers between pooled separate accounts;and (c) transfers between general assets accounts and pooled separate accounts.The commentator suggests that the reporting of such 5 percent transactionswith pooled separate accounts detracts from other transactions that shouldbe reported. As noted by the commentator, a plan meeting the requirementsof 29 CFR 2520.103-4 is not required to report on its annual report individualtransactions of the pooled separate account; however, such a plan is requiredto report any plan transactions with the pooled separate account, includingcertain reportable transactions under andSection;2520.103-6. In this regard,the Department notes that, while andSection;2520.103-6 does not exempt allplan transactions with pooled separate accounts, paragraph (b)(2)(ii)(G)of that section relating to transactions which occurred prior or subsequentto a reportable transaction with the same person during the plan year,does significantly reduce the reporting that would otherwise be required.The Department further notes that, pursuant to 29 CFR 2520.103-11(b)(2)(vi),units of participation in a pooled separate account are excluded from thedefinition of ``assets held for investment'' for purposes of the assetschedules required to accompany the annual report. In view of the aforementionedreporting exceptions and the adoption herein of an amendment increasingthe reportable transaction threshold from 3 percent to 5 percent, the Departmentbelieves that the reporting of new employer deposits, transfers betweenpooled separate accounts, and transfers between general asset accountsand pooled separate accounts does provide useful information concerningbasic transactions involving pooled separate accounts, without imposingundue burdens on either plan administrators or insurance companies maintainingsuch accounts.The third commentator offered suggested changes to the requirements ofandSection; 2520.103-9, relating to the direct filing of common or collectivetrust and pooled separate account information by banks and insurance carrierswith the Department. The Department did not propose any amendments to andSection;2520.103-9,accordingly, the suggested changes to that section are beyond the scopeof the annual reporting amendments being adopted herein.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Departmental Findings</ITAG>For purposes of Part 1 of Title I of ERISA, the filing of a completed Form5500 (including the report of an independent qualified public accountantand any required statements and schedules) by plans with 100 or more participantsconstitutes compliance with the limited exemption and alternative methodof compliance prescribed in paragraph (b) of andSection;2520.103-1, promulgatedin accordance with the authority granted the Secretary of Labor (the Secretary)under sections 104(a)(3) and 110 of ERISA.Section 104(a)(3) authorizes the Secretary to exempt any welfare plan fromall or part of the reporting and disclosure requirements of Title I ofERISA or to provide simplified reporting and disclosure, if the Secretaryfinds that such requirements are found to be inappropriate. Section 110permits the Secretary to prescribe for pension plans alternative methodsof complying with any of the reporting and disclosure requirements, ifthe Secretary finds: (1) That the use of the alternative is consistentwith the purposes of ERISA and that it provides adequate disclosure toplan participants and beneficiaries and to the Secretary; (2) that applicationof the statutory reporting and disclosure requirements would increase thecosts to the plan or impose unreasonable administrative burdens with respectto the operation of the plan; and (3) that the application of the statutoryreporting and disclosure requirements would be adverse to the interestsof plan participants in the aggregate.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Under the authority of sections 104(a)(2)(A) and 104(a)(3),the Secretary has prescribed by regulation a simplified annual report forpension and welfare plans which cover fewer than 100 participants (Form5500-C). <T3>See</T3> 29 CFR 2520.104-41. Pursuant to this authority, the Departmenthas made changes to the 1988 Form 5500-C. These changes are described inthe preamble accompanying the publication of the 1988 annual report forms.(<T3>See</T3> the ``notices'' section of today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>.)As reflected in the revised Form 5500 Series (<T3>see</T3> in the same separate part of today's <T4>Federal Register</T4>), and the amendment to andSection;2520.103-6, raisingthe threshold of reportable transactions from 3 percent to 5 percent, anumber of changes are being adopted which affect the information requiredto be reported and disclosed on the Form 5500. With regard to these changes,the Department has made the following findings under sections 110 and 104(a)(3)with regard to the utilization of the revised Form 5500 (and statementsand schedules required to be attached to the Form 5500) as an alternativemethod of compliance and limited exemption pursuant to 29 CFR 2520.103-1(b):1. The use of the revised Form 5500 as an alternative method of complianceis consistent with the purposes of Title I of ERISA and provides adequatedisclosure to plan participants and beneficiaries and adequate reportingto the Secretary. While the information required to be reported on or inconnection with the revised Form 5500 deviates, in some respects, fromthat information delineated in section 103 of the Act, the informationessential to ensuring adequate disclosure and reporting under Title I ofERISA is required to be included on or as part of the Form 5500, as revised.With regard to the revision to the definition of ``reportable transaction''for purposes of the Form 5500 to include only transactions involving amountsin excess of 5 percent of the plan's assets, the Department believes sucha change will assure the reporting of significant transactions which mayreveal fiduciary misconduct which is the purpose underlying the 3 percentstatutory requirement in section 103. The Department, on the basis of itsexperience with enforcement cases over the past ten years of ERISA, hasconcluded that disclosure of 5 percent transactions will enable it to identifytransactions that are sufficiently large to suggest that fiduciary misconductmay be involved.\5\<NOTE/> For the same reason, the Department believes the 5 percentthreshold will provide adequate disclosure to plan participants and beneficiaries.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ In the interest of efficient administration of ERISA,the Department has attempted to align the reporting and disclosure requirements,where possible, with generally accepted accounting principles. Recommendationsof the Employee Benefit Plans and ERISA Special Committee of the AmericanInstitute of Certified Public Accountants in concert with the FinancialAccounting Standards Board's Statement No. 35 indicate that, under generallyaccepted accounting principles, investments representing 5 percent or moreof net assets are treated as ``significant,'' and therefore, must be reportedon financial statements.2. The use of Form 5500 as an alternative method of compliance relievesplans subject to the annual reporting requirements from increased costsand unreasonable administrative burdens by providing a standardized formatwhich facilitates reporting, eliminates duplicative reporting requirements,and simplifies the content of the annual report in general. The Form 5500,as revised, is intended to further reduce the administrative burdens andcosts attributable to compliance with the annual reporting requirements.With regard to the change from 3 percent to 5 percent threshold for reportabletransactions, the Department's experience has been that a 3 percent thresholdhas resulted in the reporting of information which is not necessary forthe effective administration of ERISA. Therefore, reporting informationregarding transactions involving more than 3 percent, but less than 5 percentof a plan's assets, has resulted in additional costs and unreasonable administrativeburdens to plans.3. Finally, taking into account the above, the Department has determinedthat application of the statutory annual reporting and disclosure requirementswithout the availability of the Form 5500 would be adverse to the interestsof participants in the aggregate. The revised Form 5500 provides for thereporting and disclosure of basic financial and other plan informationdescribed in section 103 in a uniform, efficient, and understandable manner;thereby, facilitating the disclosure of such information to plan participants.With regard to the 5 percent reportable transaction threshold, the Department'sexperience has been that the 3 percent threshold tended not to reveal abusivecases that would not otherwise have been revealed at a 5 percent threshold.The additional disclosure of information regarding transactions involvingmore than 3 percent, but less than 5 percent, therefore only provides participantsand beneficiaries with information of negligible value and this informationis often voluminous, especially in the case of larger plans. The Departmentbelieves that the revised 5 percent threshold should provide for clearerand more concise reporting of those transactions which because of theirsize require closer scrutiny.Further, the Department has determined under section 104(a)(3) that applicationof the statutory reporting requirements to the extent that the revisionsto Form 5500 modify them would be inappropriate in the context of welfareplans for the reasons discussed above.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>The Department has determined that this regulation would have no significanteconomic impact on small entities. In conducting the analysis requiredunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act, it is estimated that adoption ofthe amendments to the annual reporting regulations_which conform to thechanges being made in the annual report forms (Form 5500 Series), makeadditional technical corrections, and eliminate certain duplicative language_willimpose no additional costs on small entities. The purpose of these revisionsis to simplify and reduce the burden attributable to the annual reportingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>The Department has determined that this regulatory action does not constitutea ``major rule'' as that term is used in Executive Order 12291 becausethe action does not result in: an annual effect on the economy of $100million; a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individualindustries, government agencies, or geographic regions; or significantadverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The amendments to the annual reporting regulations include revisions whichare necessary to conform the regulations to changes in the annual reportform (Form 5500 Series) which have been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980(P.L. 96-511). The approved information collection for the Form 5500 Seriesannual report is assigned control number 1210-0016.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 2520</ITAG>Accountants, Actuaries, Disclosure requirements, Employee benefit plans,Employee Retirement Income Security Act, Health insurance, Life insurance,Pensions, Pension and Welfare Benefits Administration, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulation</ITAG>For the reasons set out in the preamble, Part 2520 of Chapter XXV of Title29 of the Code of Federal Regulations is hereby amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="56">PART 2520_RULES AND REGULATIONS FOR REPORTING AND DISCLOSURE</ITAG>1.

At aboutthis time, XYZ plan also purchases a commercial development property inan amount equal to 8 percent of the current value of plan assets.
