(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A shipboard fire that injured nine sailorsin the Atlantic today extended to five the string of seriousaccidents this week that have cost the Navy up to seven lives.   Sailors were trying to start a boiler when it caught fire on theoiler USS Monongahela in the eastern Atlantic, the Navy said. Theblaze disabled the ship. Nine sailors suffered smoke inhalation andone also was burned, officials said.   One sailor was missing in each of two incidents earlier thisweek involving men overboard, and a plane crash aboard an aircraftcarrier on Sunday killed five people.   Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said he saw no connectionbetween the recent accidents. He said the Navy has an excellentsafety record.   A wave swept three sailors and 38 missiles off the aircraftcarrier USS Dwight D. Eisenhower early Tuesday in the Atlanticabout 90 miles southeast of Cape Hatteras, N.C. The wave struck afreight elevator as sailors moved missiles from one deck toanother, the Navy said.   Late Monday, a sailor fell off the carrier USS Carl Vinson intorough Pacific seas about 620 miles north of Wake Island, the Navysaid.   Rescuers in a helicopter plucked one Eisenhower sailor from thewater; a second was rescued by boat. They were being treated aboardship, where one was in serious condition and the other in goodcondition, the Navy said.   ``It looks like they're both going to make it,'' said Lt. PaulJenkins, a Navy spokesman in Norfolk.   Craig A. Harris, 22, of Uniontown, Pa., was missing from theEisenhower. Navy vessels and aircraft searched for him Tuesdaybefore giving up.   There were no plans to salvage the missiles because they havebeen ruined by the salt water, said Lt. Cmdr. Mike John, aspokesman for the Atlantic Fleet's air command. He said he had noinformation on their value.   The 18 Sparrow and 20 Sidewinder missiles swept off the shipwere not nuclear-powered, said an Atlantic Fleet spokeswoman,Senior Chief Petty Officer Cindy Adams. ``Therefore, they'reharmless,'' she said.   On the Vinson, a sailor fell into the sea while the carrier cutthrough 12-foot swells while returning to its home port at theAlameda Naval Air Station near San Francisco after taking part inexercises.   The Navy searched choppy waters by air and sea Tuesday for thesailor, whose name was not released.   On Sunday, a pilot making his first landing on a carrier crashedon the USS Lexington in the Gulf of Mexico, killing him and fourpeople on the ship. A videotape of the crash will not be madepublic because it is part of the investigation, the Pentagon said.   On Monday, a pilot accidentally dropped a bomb on the guidedmissile cruiser USS Reeves in the Indian Ocean, injuring fivesailors.   A Navy spokesman at the Pentagon, Lt. Bruce Cole, said the pilotapparently mistook lights from the Reeves for flares markingbarrels in the water that were to be used as bombing targets in anighttime weapons training exercise.   The worst Navy accident this year was the explosion in a turretof the battleship USS Iowa in April. The blast killed 47 sailors.   Before the most recent accidents, sailors had fallen or beenswept off Navy ships at least four times during the past fivemonths. At least four sailors were killed.</TEXT></DOC>
