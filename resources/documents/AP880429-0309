Lucky, the nation's sixth-largest supermarket chain, saidThursday it had agreed tentatively to go private in a cash andstock leveraged buyout led by Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd.   Earlier Thursday, Lucky again spurned friendly merger proposalsby American Stores Inc., of Salt Lake City, which said it wasprepared to acquire Lucky for $60 a share. American launched thebidding a month ago with a $45 a share tender offer that still isoutstanding, but Lucky rebuffed that offer and a later proposal byAmerican to pay $50 a share in a friendly merger.   ``I think we could easily see the bidding war continue,'' saidJeff Siegel of Pershing andamp; Co. in New York   American officials declined to return repeated telephone callson Thursday.   Lucky shares jumped $5.37{ to $61.50 in heavy trading Thursdayon the New York Stock Exchange, as speculation of a bidding contestheated up. American Stores rose $1.12{ to $61.50 a share.   Under the agreement with Gibbons Green, the firm will launch a$61 a share cash tender offer for 35.7 million Lucky common shares,about 92 percent of its 38.6 million common shares outstanding.   The remaining 2.9 million shares would be exchanged forpreferred stock with a stated value of $7 each, according to ajoint announcement by the two companies.   So as a whole, Lucky shareholders would receive $56 a share incash plus $7 in stated value of preferred stock for each of theirLucky shares. Assuming the preferred stock trades at slightly lessthan its face value, as analysts believe is might, the entirepackage could be worth about $2.18 billion in cash and stock.   The buyout was conditioned on financing being obtained, amajority of Lucky shares being tendered and other conditions.Gibbons Green said it expected bank financing to be committedshortly.   In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly withborrowed funds that are repaid with the company's cash flow or withmoney raised by the sale of its assets.   Gibbons Green said it would retain current Lucky management andemployees and maintain its corporate headquarters in Dublin, 25miles east of San Francisco.   ``We believe it (Lucky) is the pre-eminent supermarket companyin the areas of its operations,'' said Leonard Green, a partner inthe firm.   Analyst Carol Palmer of Duff andamp; Phelps in Chicago questionedwhether American Stores would renew its bid, although she said itcould afford a new offer of as high as $65 a share.   But Jonathan Ziegler, of Sutro andamp; Co. Inc. in San Francisco,said: ``I don't know if we've heard the last from American Stores.''   A merger of American Stores and Lucky would create the nation'slargest supermarket chain, surpassing Kroger Co.   American Stores' initial offer for Lucky in late March cameabout 1{ years after Lucky derailed a hostile takeover attempt byNew York investor Asher Edelman by undergoing a major restructuring.   American Stores, the third-largest U.S. operator of grocery anddrug stores, has about 1,620 outlets in 40 states.   Lucky employs 39,000 people and has 480 outlets, including 340stores in California.</TEXT></DOC>
