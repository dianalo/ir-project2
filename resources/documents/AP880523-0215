Dole and Bush returned to the campaign.   High noon on the Evening News.   Dan Rather wanted to talk about Iran-Contra. George Bush wantedto talk about education and the deficit. Rather said he wanted toset the record straight. Bush said Rather had impugned hisintegrity. Rather said he didn't want to be argumentative, but.Bush said it was unfair to judge his whole record by Iran and (asif bringing up a family scandal) ``how would you like it if Ijudged your career by those seven minutes when you walked off theset?'' Rather said it was more important to discuss Bush'squalifications for president than (as if delicately paraphrasing aprofanity) ``what you just referred to.''   The temperature rose, the pace quickened and soon both weretalking at once and, mercifully, neither could be heard.   In their traveling debates, the candidates pelted each other,relentlessly, with marshmallows while audiences coast to coastwondered if the cavalry would never come. Democrat or Republican,the usual pattern was that the pack would chase the front-runnersince he had the most votes and some might drop loose. Issues wereas hard to find as passion.   Almost invariably, nobody picked on Jackson or the reincarnatedHart because one man's votes were unbudgeable and the other'snon-existent. Jackson, once the voice of protest in the land, tookon the role of establishment harmonizer and gently chided theothers when they lost their heads and became adversarial.   Jackson, of course, couldn't do anything about Dole. On nationalTV one night, Dole accused Bush of ``lying'' about his record, andacross the land political behaviorists tsked and said wasn't thatshocking?   Through the last century, calling presidential candidates liarwas a relatively polite form of discourse. They were also calledtraitor, lecher, murderer, thief, drunkard, atheist, pickpocket,syphilitic, gorilla.   In the campaign of 1800, John Adams' Federalists describedThomas Jefferson as a ``mean-spirited, low-lived fellow, the son ofa half-breed Indian squaw, sired by a Virginia mulatto father ...raised wholly on hoecake made of coarse-ground Southern corn, baconand hominy, with an occasional change of fricasseed bullfrog.''   Jefferson's Republicans lashed back by spreading a story thatPresident Adams was plotting to marry off one of his sons to adaughter of King George III to begin an American dynasty and reviveroyal links with Britain.   In the politesse of the 1988 primary campaign, candidatesgrappled more with their image than with each other. Mediaconsultants and other unfrocked shrinks along the way agreed thatDole, for example, had to fight a mean streak; Bush, a wimp streak.   Other perceived streaks to be resisted were Dukakis,mechanistic; Alexander Haig, militaristic; Pierre Samuel du PontIV, rich; Simon, dull; Robertson, ``funny facts.''   They tried various disguises. Dole smiled more. Bush thrashedRather. Dukakis danced to bouzouki music. Simon flipped pancakes.Haig cozied a baby pig. Du Pont said call me Pete.   Hart and Biden brought the Democrats odd headlines. PatRobertson took care of the Republicans.   In his autobiography, Robertson wrote that God had told him aminister should not run for public office. Then he announced hemight run for president. Then his book was re-issued, with God'sinjunction excised. Then he announced that God was now telling himto run. No other candidate claimed that endorsement.   In New Hampshire, Robertson let it be known that the Russiansstill had nuclear missiles in Cuba. Not true, said the White House,but its source was a satellite only 2,000 miles up. Did Robertsonhave word from higher authority?   In Atlanta, Robertson said he knew where the American hostageswere held in Lebanon, and in Washington President Reagan wonderedaloud why he hadn't shared that information with the government.   And then George Bush put on his cowboy boots, Al Gore donned hisdown-home smile, Mike Dukakis packed up the old folks, PatRobertson dusted off the family album and away they went, to SuperTuesday, on a frantic steeplechase across 20 states in which thecorn pone of Dixie was mixed with the slick sell of Madison Avenueand a handshake was replaced by a greeting from outer space.   No primary day ever before had demanded so much travel. Socandidates flitted around like nervous fleas on a dog having anightmare, and the constant motion, the merciless speechifying, thepounding TV commercials produced a numbing blur. The WashingtonPost called it Stupor Tuesday.   Gone were the leisurely ``coffees'' the candidates had withvoters in Iowa and New Hampshire. Now they hopped from airport toairport, saw no voters, talked fast for local TV and were goneagain. Or they holed up in a hotel room and took questions from TVstations hundreds of miles away and answered via a satellite 22,300miles above the equator.   Back on earth and lacking only a magnolia in his ear, PatRobertson strode the red clay hills of South Carolina proclaiming,``I'm the only candidate who was born at Stonewall JacksonHospital. I'm the only one who went to college where Robert E. Leewas president.''   And to the condos of south Florida they came, to the homes andthe pools of senior citizens who take their franchise seriously.Richard Gephardt appeared in their living rooms with a glowing TVbenediction from a local hero, Rep. Claude Pepper, 87. Dukakisshowed up with former House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., 75, whospoke highly of Dukakis' position on Social Security and Medicare.   Gephardt sent his 80-year-old mother to the condos in person.Dukakis rallied. He sent his 84-year-old mother and his 79-year-oldfather-in-law.   And the crocuses came and they campaigned in Illinois andConnecticut and the forsythia came and they campaigned in Wisconsinand New York and the dogwood came and they campaigned inPennsylvania and Ohio and the azaleas came and they campaigned inNew Jersey and California and, each in turn, like the petals of aflower whose time had come, they fell gently to earth, all butthree.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE></DOC>
