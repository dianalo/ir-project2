A giant C-5 cargo plane flew the crew and 52 tons of cleanup gearto the southern port of Punta Arenas on Thursday. The crew was toboard on a U.S. research ship departing today for the spill, about590 miles south of the Cape Horn.   Anton Inderbitzen, head of Antarctic staff for theWashington-based National Science Foundation, said the vessel PolarDuke would take about four days to reach the spill, just off theAntarctic Peninsula and about two miles from the U.S. scientificbase Palmer Station.   However, a Greenpeace spokesman cautioned that less than twomonths remain to contain the damage.   ``They can't hang around too long,'' said Peter Wilkinson fromthe Greenpeace ship Gondwana in Antarctic waters. ``By mid- tolate-April the ice will start to freeze over.''   ``Any ship that's underwater in Antarctica with that amount offuel poses a big problem,'' he said in a radio telephone interviewto Sydney, Australia.   The environmental group is calling for an international effort tocontain damage caused by the sinking Tuesday of an Argentine navyvessel that, according to the National Science Foundation, wascarrying 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel.   In a stop in Santiago on Thursday, Inderbitzen told reporters thecrew would focus efforts on saving baby penguins in the pollutedarea.   ``All the young penguins are just about at the age where theytake their first swim,'' he said. ``When these birds enter the waterfor the first time, it could be the last time.''   The 9,300-ton Paradise Bay was leaking fuel oil at anundetermined rate, and hundreds of drums of oil and canisters ofcompressed gas had slipped from its decks, the foundation said.   A spokesman for the Argentine Ministry of Defense said Thursday,``There really wasn't a (significant) spill.''   An Argentine navy statement said an icebreaker was to arrive atthe scene today to ``assess the best ways available to combat thepollution.''   Some environmental experts and scientific groups have saidhundreds of gallons of fuel leaked from the ship and created a slickup to 16 miles long, but the Chilean navy said the reports appearedexaggerated.   ``The information that we have is that there is no big spill,''said a navy snnel at Palmer Station weregathering drums of fuel oil and tanks of compressed gas from aroundthe grounded ship.   ``The latest we have now is that there's probably 150 to 200barrels in the water,'' Renirie said in a telephone interview fromSantiago. ``And there's still oil coming out of the ship.''   Inderbitzen said the Science Foundation, which organized thecleanup mission and directs all U.S. activities in Antarctica,feared lasting environmental damage.   Some dead penguins had already been sighted, and the slick hadcaused isolated schools of krill, a shrimp-like animal, to surface,Renirie said.   Inderbitzen said Antarctica's unspoiled environment requiresspecial measures to contain the spill, which is near two areas setaside for scientific study under terms of the Antarctic Treaty.   ``In warm weather it's easier for plants and even animals torecover from an accident,'' he said. ``But in Antarctica, it takesplants and animals many, many years to recover because of the cold.It's a very, very fragile environment.''   The crew has a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilledoil and pumping it into floating tanks, and a small tugboat andinflatable booms to contain drifting oil.   The cleanup work will be peformed by Marine Pollution ControlCo., under contract to the U.S. Navy, Renirie said.</TEXT></DOC>
