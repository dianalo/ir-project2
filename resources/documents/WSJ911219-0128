The public queued up outside the EgyptianHall, Piccadilly, for hours in order to pay a shilling forthe privilege of beholding &quot;The Raft of the Medusa,&quot; TheodoreGericault's huge, 24-by-18-foot painting of shipwreckedsailors adrift in the sea off the coast of Africa. Today artis still one of the best spectacles on offer, but we live ina more cautious age. The painting that traveled across theChannel in the early 19th century is now deemed too fragileto make the half-mile trip up the Champs Elysees from theLouvre to the Grand Palais for the first major retrospectiveof the art of Gericault.   That Gericault's best-known work should be missing fromthis exhibition of 300 paintings, drawings and engravings isironic but appropriate; the fame of the &quot;Medusa&quot; has longobscured the true worth of an artist who is arguably theequal of his more famous contemporaries, Jacques Louis Davidand Eugene Delacroix. Everyone knows the painting but fewrecognize the painter, and this is for several reasons.Gericault died when he was 32, at a time when, like mostpainters, he was just emerging from his long apprenticeshipto the past.</LP><TEXT>   Moreover, he is an art historical enigma, a copyist ofstartling originality whose work manages to be derivative yetmodern. In their energetic brushwork and melodramaticlighting, Gericault's copies of Raphael and Michelangelopresage the later work of Courbet and Cezanne. He evenmanaged to make the classical themes he copied from suchconstipated academics as David and Jean-Antoine Grosinteresting if not downright exciting. What's more, Davidknew what he was up against. The old master was puzzled byGericault's 1812 portrait of an anonymous &quot;Officer of theImperial Guard,&quot; saying: &quot;I don't recognize this touch.&quot; Andindeed, the &quot;touch&quot; would not show up in French painting foranother 40 years.   These days, Gericault is merely hard to characterize andexplain, but his contemporaries found his art both confusingand unsettling. He painted during a period (1812-1824) thatstands as a parenthesis in French history, a historicalvacuum during which history seemed to have lost the momentumthat carried it through 20 years of revolution, war andempire. Not yet a republic but no longer a convincingkingdom, post-Napoleonic France was rudderless and drifting,very much like the raft in Gericault's painting.   Such successful painters as David and Gros played up tothe era's most cherished myths with portraits of generals andbattle scenes in the flat, technicolored academic styleperfectly suited to the strident claims of imperial bombast.The show at the Grand Palais, which runs until Jan. 6, beginswith Gros's tribute to Napoleonic overstatement, the stately,static painting of &quot;Murat, King of Naples.&quot; On the wallopposite hangs Gericault's more somber portrait of the&quot;Officer of the Imperial Guard&quot; from the same period.Although well received by the critics who saw Gericault'sofficer as heroism personified, the painting is moresubversive than the hagiographic work of Gros and David.Hesitant and reflective, the officer seems at odds with hispowerful horse, looking backward over his shoulder as hismount charges into war. French historian Jules Michelet wrotethat &quot;he makes war while thinking,&quot; a sure recipe fordisaster in battle.   The Paris show is full of the horses Gericault loved andpainted in abundance throughout his short career. He devotedentire canvases to horse parts; a large painting depictsthree rows of hindquarters-abstracted and detached from therest of the animal, but powerful nonetheless. Whether paintedalone in the &quot;Barberi Race,&quot; a riderless horse race held atthe end of Carnival every year in Rome, or mounted in theportrait of &quot;Three Trumpeters on Horseback,&quot; the horsesexpress a superhuman and unfettered sexuality.   The ironic juxtaposition of the horse's power with therider's impotence illustrates in formal terms Gericault'stragic view of the human nature. The rounded, sensualhorseflesh represents a physical ideal that no spindlysoldier can attain. However heroic the posture of the officerin the 1812 painting, he can only be diminished by comparisonwith the horse. And yet, Gericault's irony manages to beromantic; unlike his classical masters, he is able to paintfailure in all its heroism.   The artist's compassion for that failure can be seen inthe superb portraits of madmen he painted at the end of hislife. They supposedly were commissioned by a specialist inthe study of monomania to illustrate different kinds ofinsanity: kleptomania, envy, the compulsion to gamble,pedophilia. The illnesses could be picturesque, but Gericaultavoids caricature by means of his rigorous realism, hisfidelity to the details that make these textbookillustrations individuals rather than mere types. Like thearms and legs from the morgue he drew in preparation for his&quot;The Raft of the Medusa,&quot; these faces are poignant ratherthan macabre.   How well Gericault articulates the tragedy of the insane,shipwrecked in their madness, adrift, unmoored but desperatefor contact with the rest of the world. And nowhere is thattheme better expressed than in &quot;The Raft of the Medusa,&quot; hispainting of a real-life shipwreck off the coast of Senegal.The many preparatory oils and drawings at the Grand Palaisshow that the artist took his theme seriously, interviewingtwo of the wreck's 15 survivors and commissioning a smallmodel of the raft from which to paint.   Many of the preliminary drawings for the &quot;Medusa&quot; exhibitGericault's unique and paradoxical blend of formal beauty andgrisly content. The hacked-off arm and hand in one drawingretains its expressive power, its nobility, though it hasbecome a &quot;thing,&quot; long separated from its human origins.Similarly, the painting's pathetic survivors appear in alltheir failed grandeur. Hungry, thirsty and nearly dead afterweeks at sea, a few still manage to wave frantically at thespeck on the horizon that was to become the ship that rescuedthem. Despite the artist's grim realism, his eye for grislydetail, the wasted bodies near death are as beautiful asthose vital bodies on the ceiling of Michelangelo's SistineChapel.   Like any great painting, &quot;The Raft of the Medusa&quot; has muchto say about life and art. Shipwrecked sailors or shiftlessmadmen, we are never equal to the challenge of the other; wealways fall short of our desire to connect with the world.But our despair and frustration possess a violent andcreative energy. As he lay dying of a bone abcess brought onby repeated falls from his horse, Gericault complained thathe had never painted anything worthwhile. Yet he took todrawing his left hand with his right, explaining that &quot;I amusing myself.&quot; In Gericault's world, we have to make do withwhat remains, and what remains is art.   ---   Ms. Tuttle writes regularly on the arts from Paris.</TEXT></DOC>
