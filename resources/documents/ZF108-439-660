Because it offers readers access to high-quality research onthe mechanisms, tools, and processes involved in supporting complex systemsof scale and longevity requiring substantial investments in definition,design, development, maintenance, and related support activities.andP;  TOSEM willpublish significant papers on all aspects of research related to complexsoftware systems, generally characterized by a scale requiring development byteams, rather than individuals.andP;  The editor-in-chief of TOSEM is W. RichardsAdrion, University of Massachusetts.andM;ACM SIGSOFT members can subscribe for the reduced price of $11.00.andP;  All otherACM members can subscribe for $22.00 and student members can subscribe for$17.00.andP;  The cost to nonmember subscribers will be $85.00.andP;  ACM SIGSOFTmembers must subscribe by December 31, 1990 to qualify for the reduced $11.00price.andM;A New journal to Serve the Needs of the Simulation CommunityandM;ACM Transactions on Modeling and Computer Simulation (TOMACS) will become theprimary resource for technically excellent material on all aspects ofcomputer simulation and the modeling of complex systems studied throughsimulation techniques.andP;  Its topical emphasis on discrete event simulationwill relate to combined, distributed and hybrid simulation; model theory,development, management, verification, and validation; complexity, diagnostictechniques, and methodology; runtime efficiency; programming andspecification languages; applications; variance reduction; credibilityassessment; Al; computer graphics; and much more.andP;  The editor-in-chief isRichard E. Nance, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.andM;All ACM members can subscribe for $30.00, student members for $25.00 andnonmembers for $95.00.andP;  TOMACS, a quarterly archival journal, will startpublishing in january 1991.andM;New Titles in the ACM Press Books ProgramandM;Two of the three new titles that are about to be published in the ACM PressBooks Program-ACM's collaborative publishing venture with Addison-Wesley-arein the History Series-A History of Scientific Computing, edited by StephenNash, George Mason University, and A History of Medical Informatics, editedby Bruce I. Blum, Applied Physics Laboratory at the johns Hopkins University,and Karen Duncan, Health Information Systems.andM;A History of Scientific Computing is an historical documentary which shiftsits focus from people to problems to methods and places, depending on wherethe action takes place.andP;  Thus, essays about gifted contributors to the fieldof scientific and numeric computing-like John von Neumann, James Wilkinson,George Forsyth, and Howard Aiken-give way to examples of how the drive tosolve particular problems influenced the development of algorithms, software,and even computers.andP;  Methods that have led to new tools in computer analysislike the fast Fourier transform and finite-element and interactive methodsalso are highlighted.andP;  The chronicle continues with discussion of thecontributions of societies like ACM and SIAM and institutions such as the LosAlamos Laboratory and the former National Bureau of Standards.andP;  The volumecomes full circle with a view of work on numerical analysis in Europe and theSoviet Union.andM;This book, approximately 304 pages, is available at a cost of $44.50 tomembers and  49.50 to nonmembers.andP;  The order number is 702901.andM;A History of Medical Informatics gives a firsthand look at the earlydevelopment of medical informatics, the application of computer technology tomedicine.andP;  It includes papers by many of the field's pioneers, delivered atan ACM-sponsored conference at the National Library of Medicine in November1987.andP;  The retrospective examines accomplishments in medical informatics inlight of present research.andM;The book, about 600 pages, is available at a cost of $44.50 to members and$49.50 to nonmembers.andP;  The order number is 702900.andM;Bridging the Gap between Computer Science and PsychologyandM;The third new title in the Books Program is User Interface Design, by HaroldThimbleby, Stirling University.andP;  This book provides a much needed bridgebetween computer science and psychology.andP;  It describes the important conceptsand essential techniques underlying the design of interactive systems.andP;  Fullcoverage is given to the human factors involved, but the primary focus is onthe technical and scientific methods appropriate to the effective design ofuser interfaces.andP;  Case studies of a variety of design projects are described,and the author provides practical applications of generative user-engineeringprinciples.andP;  It is suitable for courses on user interface design, humancomputer interaction and human factors in departments of computer science,cognitive science, psychology and Al.andP;  It will also be of interest toprogrammers and researchers.andM;User Interface Design is 480 pages and is available to members for $33.95 andnonmembers for $37.75.andP;  The order number is 704907.andM;Cooperation Among ComputersandM;Cooperation among computers and also the need for cooperation betweenuniversities/colleges, industry, and government to advance the development ofcomputing techniques is emphasized in CSC  90-The Proceedings of the 1990 ACMEighteenth Annual Computer Science Conference, held in Washington, DC,February 20-22, 1990.andM;Key areas covered include cooperation and competition in the computerindustry, advancement of sciences through modern information technology,computer reasoning, problem solving and intuition as frameworks forintelligence as information processing, and multi-disciplinary engineeringenvironments.andM;CSC '90 is 500 pages and available to members for $26.00 and nonmembers for$34.00.andP;  The order number is 404900.andM;Orders by check, ACM Press Books, no postage/handling charges.andP;  Nopostage/handling on subscriptions.andP;  Orders for CSC '90 or any order chargedor invoiced, please submit postage/handling according to the following chart.andM;Shipping and handling on orders totalling: $1.00 to $20.00  $3.00)/$20.01 to$30.00  $4.00)/$30.01 to $40.00 $5.00)/$40.01 to $60.00  $6.00)/ $60.01 to$100.00  $7.00)/$100.01 to $500.00  $8.00)/$500.01 to $1,000.00$10.00)/$1,000.01 and over ($15.00).andO;</TEXT></DOC>
