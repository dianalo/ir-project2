The plant, built last year, produces the Mercury Tracer, a subcompact car based on a design by Mazda Motor Corp., Ford's Japanese partner. The car is to go on sale in the U.S. March 26.    A Ford spokesman said about 780 production workers, represented by the Confederation de Trabadores Mexicanos union, were involved in the strike, which he called a &quot;legal&quot; walkout that followed a breakdown in negotiations on a new wage contract Saturday night. The plant currently produces about 200 Tracers a day and employs a total of 1,100 workers.    The spokesman said Ford built the highly automated, $500 million plant to satisfy a Mexican government requirement that Ford build more cars in that country to continue to sell cars in Mexico. For that reason, he said, Ford can't respond to the workers' demands for higher wages by cutting production at the Hermosillo plant.    The Ford spokesman declined to comment on whether workers were demanding a wage increase of as much as 70%, which had been reported in the Mexican press. Currently, the striking workers earn about 1,120 pesos -- or about $1.09, based on current exchange rates -- for each of the 45 hours they work every week. </TEXT></DOC>
