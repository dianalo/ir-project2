NASA didn't estimate how long the rocket problem would set back the launch, which had been scheduled for June 2. The space agency, which fired the rocket last Wednesday, said it only recently discovered that a portion of a nozzle had broken off. The rocket nozzles are important because they steer the rocket during takeoff.    David Winterhalter, NASA's director of systems engineering and analysis, said the launch delay would likely be measured in &quot;weeks, not days.&quot; He said about one-third of a membrane that anchors a nozzle component broke off. Should that happen in flight, he said, it could mean that the nozzle would be unable to move or, in the worst case, hot gases could leak and explode. Neither happened during the test, he added.    NASA said it didn't know yet what caused the nozzle problem, but said it was unrelated to the O-ring joints, which join the sections of the rocket and which failed during the Challenger disaster nearly two years ago. NASA said the redesigned joints had operated properly during the test.    Morton Thiokol Inc., which built the booster rockets for the Challenger, is redesigning the rocket to be used when shuttle flights resume. Separately, four Morton Thiokol workers were killed and one was seriously injured in a fire that destroyed an MX missile plant in Utah.    A NASA official said booster rocket segments that were to be used in the June launch were scheduled to begin arriving at the Kennedy Space Center from Morton Thiokol on Jan. 6, and their assembly was to begin on Jan. 27. But he added that until NASA understands what went wrong in the recent test, the booster rockets would be held at Morton Thiokol's Utah plant.    A NASA spokeswoman said that the nozzle part that failed in the test was redesigned after the Challenger disaster because of previous problems with it. But those flaws, she said, didn't play a role in the shuttle accident.    The shuttle program has been stalled since the Challenger exploded on Jan. 28, 1986, 74 seconds after liftoff, killing its seven crew members. The disaster, which was followed closely by launch failures of NASA and Air Force unmanned rockets, crippled the country's ability to launch satellites and severely undermined NASA's credibility.    Since that time, the government has been pushing private companies to move into the satellite launch business, using unmanned rockets. French and Chinese rocket launch companies also have moved to fill launch demand. The redesigned shuttle, once it begins regular flights, is expected to be largely devoted to military cargo.    A Morton Thiokol spokesman declined to comment on the incident. He said the company wouldn't elaborate on NASA's statement. </TEXT></DOC>
