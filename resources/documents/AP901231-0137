An employeeeligible for a raise in January will instead be reviewed in April.Those eligible in May could get raises in August.   The company has been under a partial hiring freeze since lastApril, Tuley said. It also is considering cutting the percentage ofthe newspaper devoted to news and increasing the percentage ofadvertising, as well as possibly cutting costs in its productiondepartment, he said.   ``Right now, I don't anticipate we're going to have to lay offpeople, but I certainly couldn't guarantee that,'' he said.

Scripps Co., whichreported a 17.2 percent drop in publishing profits for the firstnine months of this year.</TEXT><HEAD>Norfolk, Va., Newspapers Combining Into All-Day Format</HEAD><DATELINE>NORFOLK, Va.

The law, which affects city workers and private businesses with15 or more employees, requires adjustable workstations, regularbreaks and training on safe use of VDTs. It also recommendstransfer to non-VDT work for pregnant women who ask to be moved.   ``This legislation ... will ensure San Francisco workers areprotected from dangerous injury, without driving away businesses,''Mayor Art Agnos said as he signed the ordinance Dec. 27. ``It'slegislation on the cutting edge of social change.''   The ordinance requires compliance within two years for mostbusinesses, but Agnos worked out a compromise with business andlabor leaders calling for a longer period. The amendments proposedunder the compromise are to be voted on next month by the Board ofSupervisors.   The proposed changes are a three-step program for compliance:   - After one year, new equipment would have to meet standards inthe ordinance.   - For existing workstations, retrofitting that cost less than$250 would have to be completed within 30 months.   - Retrofitting that cost more than $250 would have to becompleted within four years.   The legislation was pushed by a coalition of activists who citeddangers to VDT operators, including repetitive strain injury, backand neck pain, deteriorating vision and possible miscarriages.   The law will affect an estimated 56,000 workers and will costabout $14 million in the private sector within the first 30 months,said Paul Varacalli, executive director of Service EmployeesInternational Union Local 590, which backed the bill.
