Salwen </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AM </CO><IN> HRD STK TNM IND </IN><TEXT>   AM International appears well on the way to cleaning up its shop.    The Chicago-based maker of business-graphics equipment Monday agreed to sell the Web Press unit of its Harris Graphics unit for about $250 million -- roughly what AM paid for all of Harris in 1986. The agreement allows AM to reduce debt, while retaining Harris's profitable bindery and forms business, which has annual revenue of about $200 million.    Market players believe AM agreed to sell Web Press -- which has consistently disappointed Wall Street -- to prevent some raider from acquiring the entire company and doing it first. A few argue that the company remains an attractive takeover candidate.    After all, suitors don't find too many target companies with revenue exceeding $800 million and a market capitalization of just $250 million. For its part, AM contends that it hasn't received any merger interest.    In Monday's accord, Komori Printing Machinery of Japan agreed to pay AM $181 million and sell back 3.9 million AM shares; in reaction, AM shares jumped 3/4 to 4 3/4. The stock continued to gain yesterday, adding 1/8 to close at 4 7/8.    The accord with Komori allows AM to sell Web Press to a higher bidder if one can be found before the sale is completed. &quot;There are a number of people who expressed interest in Web Press,&quot; explains Merle H. Banta, AM's chairman and chief executive officer. &quot;We don't want to foreclose those people.&quot;    The move does wonders for AM's balance sheet. Mr. Banta says the proceeds will be used to pay part of the company's $291 million of long-term debt and $52 million of short-term borrowings.    That prospect has got some analysts excited -- a sentiment that hasn't surrounded AM's shares in years. &quot;Management has done an excellent job in cutting costs and improving margins at the old AM (businesses),&quot; says Mitchell Kuflik, director of research at Brahman Securities, a New York institutional research firm. &quot;Now it is divesting a problem area.&quot;    Mr. Kuflik says another foreign company is likely to up the ante for Web Press. &quot;The stock is extremely undervalued at this level,&quot; he says.    Wall Street has been repeatedly disappointed by Web Press, which makes web printing presses. &quot;The unit seemed to encounter one problem after another,&quot; says Philip Sancken, an analyst at Piper, Jaffray andamp; Hopwood in Seattle. The backdrop for Web Press's products couldn't be better than it is now, he argues, citing the potential for strong sales overseas and magazines' efforts to &quot;downsize.&quot;    &quot;Despite that, the company wasn't able to capitalize on it,&quot; Mr. Sancken says. Now, he says, AM &quot;has almost returned to where it started. They had a problem and now they fixed it.&quot;    Without Web Press, analysts expect AM to earn more than 60 cents a share in the fiscal year ending July 31, 1989; the company is likely to earn about 15 cents for the year that ends next month, though those numbers will include Web Press.    About two-thirds of the roughly $600 million in annual revenue at the &quot;old AM&quot; -- before the company acquired Harris Graphics in 1986 -- is generated by the company's supplies and services division. That unit, which Mr. Banta believes is the largest of its kind, services graphics equipment and sells inks and other supplies to the graphics industry. The cash flow generated by the unit provides a solid floor for the company's stock and minimizes risk, Brahman's Mr. Kuflik argues; he estimates that the old AM has operating profit of about $40 million.    Moreover, Mr. Banta says, he is seeing steady growth from such businesses as newspaper-insert and mailing-room equipment (orders are up 16% this year), bindery equipment, and forms equipment in overseas markets. The situation is a far cry from 1984, when AM emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law proceedings.    For now, he adds, he will focus on AM's core businesses, though he will consider making acquisitions of &quot;some small things.&quot; Mr. Banta notes that no acquisitions are in the works; any purchase would probably be small enough not to encumber the balance sheet.    Messrs. Kuflik and Sancken are recommending the stock at these levels. Each contends that the shares could easily reach 7.    Mr. Banta has about 1.1 million incentives to boost the share price, as well; that is how many shares of AM common he holds.    ---   AM International   (NYSE; Symbol: AM)   Business: Graphics equipment   Year ended July 31, 1987:   Sales: $1.16 billion   Net income: $12.5 million, or 11 cents a share -   Third quarter, April 30, 1988:   Per-share earnings:*   Average daily trading volume:   174,237 shares   Common shares outstanding: 51.5 million   *Preferred dividend requirements exceeded quarter's net income of $1.6 million</TEXT></DOC>
