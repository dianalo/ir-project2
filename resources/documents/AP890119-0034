City commissioners, meeting in emergency session, appointed apanel with subpoena power to investigate the fatal police shootingof a black motorcyclist that sparked the disturbances. And thesister of the motorcyclist's passenger, who died when the vehiclecrashed, made a televised appeal for an end to the violence.   Deputy Police Chief Walter Martinez said 50 arrests had been madeby 1 a.m. Thursday, on what he called ``the quietest night so far''since violence erupted Monday. That brought the total of arrestsover three days to about 400.   The rioting that followed the killing of the 23-year-old, unarmedmotorcylist by a Hispanic policeman has left one person dead, eightshot, about 20 buildings burned and numerous others looted in theblack neighborhoods of Overtown and Liberty City.   The violence came as the city prepared to play host to Sunday'sSuper Bowl football game, which has attracted tourists and mediafrom around the country by the thousands.   On Wednesday, the city was quiet until late afternoon, when shotswere fired at police in the Overtown section and rock throwing wasreported in Liberty City, said Miami police spokesman David Rivero.Authorities again cordoned off Overtown.   ``We had a few shots fired at us, but fortunately no one washurt,'' Rivero said. Scores of Miami police squad cars and a stateSWAT team went to the spot in a show of force aimed at heading offmore violence.   In Liberty City, police said fire caused minor damage to aKentucky Fried Chicken franchise after a large crowd gatheredoutside throwing rocks and bottles.   Police spokeswoman Stephanie Gibbs said shots were also fired androcks and bottles thrown in black sections of Coconut Grove, aneighborhood south of downtown that previously had not beenseriously affected by the rioting.   But by 9:30 p.m. it was so quiet in Coconut Grove that policecalled off a planned sweep of the neighborhood and decided not toarrest a large group of people standing on a streetcorner, saidCoral Gables police Sgt. Wayne Harris. Coral Gables is a cityadjacent to Miami.   Martinez said 250 policemen were deployed, including fieldforces, small groups of officers equipped with riot gear that movein quickly to quell specific disturbances.   ``We hope we can normalize and go back to routine patrolling,''Martinez said. ``We don't like being out here 12 hours and beingshot at.''   Claudia Lubrin, whose brother, Allen Blanchard, died in ahospital Tuesday, went on television to ``plead to the Overtownpeople that they stop the riots.   ``Put down your weapons _ I do not want my brother to beremembered with the riots,'' she said.   Commissioners unanimously approved the special panel amidwarnings from black leaders that there will be more disturbances ifauthorities do not act quickly to ease tensions.   Black leaders warned Mayor Xavier Suarez before the commissionmeeting that their community would no longer accept empty promisesand business as usual.   ``The word is out that there will be more disturbance,'' said TheRev. William Washington. ``Now we've got to act and act quick.''   The panel set up by the commission will investigate the death ofClement Lloyd, shot in the head Monday night as he and a friend spedthrough Overtown.   After discussions, the commissioners approved a suggestion byMiller Dawkins, the lone black on the five-member commission, whowanted a board consisting of five policemen and five Overtownresidents, with the mayor as chairman. The panel will have the powerto subpoena witnesses.   Dawkins acknowledged the board will not satisfy the young peoplethrowing rocks and bottles, and he appealed to them for time.   ``I'd like to tell them to give us a chance to work this out, andto work on all our other ills, such as poor housing, poor education,joblessness,'' he said. ``And they have to work with us instead ofcreating other problems like they are doing now.''   Some 700 police officers in riot gear arrested an estimated 325people Tuesday night, most for looting. Most of those arrested foralleged looting were released on $250 bail. Charges ranged fromtrespassing to armed robbery, and many suspects were unable to makebond, according to jail officials.   No looting loss estimates were available.   The FBI, the State Attorney's Office and the police internalreview board are also investigating the police shooting. WilliamLozano, 29, the Colombian-born police officer who shot themotorcyclist, was relieved of duty with pay pending theinvestigation.   City workers entered the riot-torn neighborhoods Wednesday tobegin cleaning the streets. Most schools that closed Tuesdayreopened, although administrators said they expected to sendteachers and students home early.   The violence began Monday night in Overtown as crowds throwingrocks and bottles, firing rifles and setting fires. On Tuesdayviolence broke out when a white man in a luxury car fired into acrowd of blacks in Overtown, wounding one man.   By nightfall burning and looting had spread to adjacent LibertyCity, site of a 1980 race riot also linked to the death of a blackmotorcylist at the hands of white police officers. The 1980 uprisingleft 18 people dead.   ``The automatic gunfire _ I don't think we had that in the early'80s,'' said Lt. Rick Colpitts. ``With the high-caliber rifles thatare accurate and deadly ... it's the most dangerous situation I'vebeen in in 22 years as a policeman.''   On Tuesday night, a teen-ager was shot to death in an argumentover a looted office check-riting machine, police said.   Others shot included two suspected snipers hit in the legs bypolice, a 7-year-old girl hit by a sniper and a policeman whosebulletproof vest stopped a shotgun pellet, police said.   At a special bond hearing Wednesday that required opening of asecond courtrooom, most people alleged to be looters were orderedreleased on $250 bail.   The Miami Heat basketball game at the Miami Arena at the edge ofOvertown was postponed Tuesday night. The mayor assured Super Bowlfans that the rioting would have no effect on the game, which is 15miles north of Overtown.   ``We don't think there's any problem in making sure the peoplehave absolute safety in going to the game if that's what they'recoming to Miami for,'' Suarez said.   In New York City, a spokesman for the Rev. Al Sharpton, whofigured prominently in the Tawana Brawley case, said Sharpton wouldspeak at a weekend rally in Miami and attend Blanchard's funeral.   Miss Brawley, a black New York teen-ager, claimed she wasabducted and sexually abused by several white men, but authoritiessaid they could not substantiate her story. Sharpton maintained theinvestigation was conducted in a racist manner.</TEXT></DOC>
