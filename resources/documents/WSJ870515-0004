By a 62-37 vote, the Senate defeated an attempt by Sen. Jake Garn (R., Utah) to remove those provisions from legislation to raise money for the insolvent Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. The entire measure, identical to one the Senate passed in March, was approved by a voice vote.    The move puts additional pressure on House Banking Committee Chairman Fernand St Germain (D., R.I.) to agree to consider those issues when lawmakers meet to reconcile differences between the two chambers' plans to recapitalize the FSLIC.    The House bill, passed last week, is limited to allowing the FSLIC to raise as much as $5 billion over two years by selling 30-year bonds. The Senate version, which would allow the FSLIC to raise as much as $7.5 billion over the same amount of time by the same method, contains a number of other provisions. Those include the curbs on limited-service banks and a moratorium on federal regulators giving banks new authority to engage in securities, real estate and insurance activities.    Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D., Wis.) wants to link the curbs on limited-service banks with the FSLIC measure in the hope of avoiding a veto; Reagan administration strongly opposes the restrictions. But Rep. St Germain has said he won't consider the other provisions of the Senate-passed bill without first holding hearings on them.    Limited-service banks, also called nonbank banks, either take deposits or make commercial loans, but don't do both. Thus they skirt the legal definition of a bank and evade the restrictions put on banks.    Sen. Garn wanted to remove the parts of the bill dealing with limited-service banks and new bank powers in order to speed its final approval. A similar attempt failed by a 54-35 vote when the Senate first considered the legislation in March.    Meanwhile, Comptroller General Charles Bowsher said that neither chamber's measure to recapitalize the FSLIC would be enough to resolve the problems of the troubled thrift industry. Mr. Bowsher, head of the General Accounting Office, cited estimates that it would cost $25 billion to take care of the 380 thrifts that are beyond hope. The estimates were made by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which oversees the FSLIC.    Mr. Bowsher's comments were in the GAO's qualified report on the FSLIC's financial condition. The report shows that the insurance fund had losses of $10.9 billion last year, resulting in a $6.3 billion deficit. &quot;These factors indicate that the (FSLIC) may be unable to continue to fulfill its mission and meet its financial obligations,&quot; Mr. Bowsher wrote.    Bank Board officials said yesterday that about 100 thrifts that counted their contributions to the FSLIC's secondary reserve as assets will have to reduce their net worth by a total of $823.7 million. That's because the secondary reserve, which was established in 1961 to supplement the FSLIC's resources, has been erased by the fund's losses.    Fewer than five of the thrifts will become insolvent as a result, Bank Board officials said.    The secondary reserve consisted of prepayments of insurance premiums by FSLIC-insured institutions. The prepayments stopped in 1973 and were to be gradually repaid to the thrifts. The repayments stopped in the early 1980s when the ratio of the fund's primary reserves -- the fund's accumulated income -- to insured deposits dropped.    The FSLIC insures $900 billion in deposits in 3,200 federally insured thrifts. </TEXT></DOC>
