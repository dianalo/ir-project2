Clashes between police and protesters on Tuesday left at leastfive people injured and nearly 300 arrested.   The strike was called to protest austerity measures imposed thismonth, including food price increases ranging from 20 percent to100 percent.   Meanwhile, Shining Path guerrillas killed seven policemen andwounded five others in two attacks Monday and Tuesday on policeposts in Peru's eastern jungle. Police said they did not know ifthe attacks were strike-related.   Leftist guerrillas supporting the work stoppage launched bombattacks on buildings in several Peruvian cities, including one inLima that wounded three passers-by, officials said.   Prime Minister Armando Villanueva called Tuesday's strike afailure and said just 30 percent of Peru's factories and businesseswere affected.   But strike leader Alberto Ramirez said 80 percent of factories,stores and businesses in Lima were shut down by the strike Tuesdayand a slightly smaller percentage closed nationwide.   The strike cut Lima bus transportation Tuesday by 50 percent,and most banks and government offices in downtown Lima opened lateand were understaffed, officials said. School attendence was lowand about half the shops and stores in downtown Lima were closed.

It was the third general strike against the 3-year-oldgovernment of President Alan Garcia, head of the governingcenter-left Aprista Party.   The strike was called by the General Confederation of PeruvianWorkers, which claims to represent 90 percent of Peru's 1.6 millionunionized workers, and was endorsed by the Marxist United Left, thenation's second strongest political party.
