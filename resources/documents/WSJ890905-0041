Federal prosecutors plan to retry former Mayor Gerald Blessey and Reba Capers, former director of the Greater Biloxi Economic Development Foundation. They were charged with illegally using $160,000 of a $500,000 HUD grant for costs related to a waterfront-project bond sale, rather than the project's infrastructure development as approved by HUD officials.    &quot;We absolutely intend to retry,&quot; said George Phillips, U.S. attorney for the southern district of Mississippi. Mr. Blessey's lawyer, Boyce Holleman, said the mistrial means &quot;the government lost&quot; and its &quot;case gets weaker&quot; as the prosecution attempts to pursue it further. </TEXT></DOC>
