The move followed a four-month internal investigation thatConsumers Union said uncovered a &quot;pattern of excessivecommissions&quot; paid to a broker for the purchase of securitiesbacked by mortgages of the Government National MortgageAssociation.</LP><TEXT>   The chief financial officer, David Granston, had beensuspended in February pending results of the internalinvestigation. Neither Mr. Granston nor his attorney could bereached for comment.   David C. Berliner, assistant director for Consumers Union,said Consumers Union, which is weighing civil action againstMr. Granston, is meeting with law enforcement officials todetermine whether to bring criminal charges as well. He saidno replacement has yet been named for Mr. Granston.   Mr. Berliner said the excess payments, for the period from1986 through 1991, are estimated in the range of severalhundred thousand dollars. He said the report noted thatcertain documents in Mr. Granston's handwriting contained a&quot;formula&quot; indicating the sharing of the mark-ups with thebroker, who Consumers Union identified as Stanley Feminellaof American Express Co.'s Shearson Lehman Bros. unit, oncertain Ginnie Mae purchases.   Mr. Feminella was traveling and could not be reached forcomment, said a spokesman for Shearson, who added that&quot;Consumers Union brought the matter to our attention recentlyand we are cooperating with them in an investigation.&quot; Mr.Feminella couldn't be reached at his Long Island home.   Mr. Berliner said Mr. Feminella also previously had workedfor PaineWebber Group Inc. and David Lerner andamp; Associateswhile acting as broker for Mr. Granston and Consumers Union.PaineWebber officials couldn't immediately confirm whetherMr. Feminella had been an employee.   Roger Berlin, director of finance for David Lerner andamp;Associates, said Mr. Feminella had been employed by theSyosset-based firm for one year and had left in 1986. But headded that Mr. Feminella couldn't have charged excessivecommissions while with David Lerner. &quot;We have a fixed pricepolicy&quot; for Ginnie Mae securities. &quot;When a security is put upfor sale, the price is determined by the trading desk. Thesalesmen can't charge more for the security.&quot;   Valerie Kinderman, David Lerner's regulatory complianceofficer, said that the firm recently was contacted byattorneys for Consumers Union and that it has just begun tolook into the transactions. She added that the attorneys saidthey based their conclusions on published prices innewspapers, and that such conclusions would be inaccuratebecause newspapers only provide closing prices and notreal-time prices during the trading day.   Mr. Berliner of Consumers Union said the investigatorsreached the conclusion that the mark-ups were excessive afterconsultations with brokers and &quot;others who were experts inthe area.&quot; He added that &quot;we don't know whether thebrokerages knew the sizes of the commissions being charged.&quot;He said some of the mark-ups went as high as 6% of thetransaction. The mark-ups on Ginnie Mae purchases by aninstitutional buyer generally is around 1/16 of a point,according to the Public Securities Association. One pointequals $10 for each $1,000 face amount.   Mr. Granston had been chief financial officer forConsumers Union since 1983. Mr. Berliner said that an earlierinvestigation in 1987 by Coopers andamp; Lybrand, conducted at therequest of Consumers Union, failed to turn up any problem. Hesaid Consumers Union is seeking a new auditing firm.   Consumers Union has an annual operating budget of justover $100 million. In the fiscal year ended May 30, 1990, ithad $66 million in cash reserves, most of which were investedin Ginnie Maes.   In a memo to the staff, Mr. Berliner said &quot;we want toemphasize the fact that the events under review in no wayaffect Consumers Union's financial stability, nor haveanything whatsoever to do with our testing and reporting. Nofinancial or other assets of our organization are in any wayjeopardized.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
