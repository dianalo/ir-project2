(Cast in Code)(column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Coffee, Peter.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Software developers would be wise to adapt Isaac Asimov'sscience-fictional Laws of Robotics to their own practices.andP;  If theword robots is replaced with computer systems, the First Law ofComputer Systems would declare that a system may not harm a humanor through inaction allow one to come to harm.andP;  An example of thislaw is automated teller machines which have a fallback mode thatallows them to grant a withdrawal even if the ATM's connection tothe mainframe has been severed.andP;  The Second Law would state that asystem must obey the orders given it by humans unless such ordersconflict with the First Law, and this Law is also followed by mostsystems.andP;  The Third Law would state that a system must protect itsown existence as long as that end does not conflict with the Firstand Second Laws.andP;  The Third Law is not yet followed by allsystems, which frequently crash because of bugs orincompatibilities.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Program Development TechniquesGuidelinesReliabilityCompatibilityDebugging.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Last week, I witnessed a murder-suicide pact between PC and Macintoshversions of Microsoft Word.andP;  It wasn't a pretty sight.andM;The poison pill was a file produced by Word 5.0 on a PC, sent to the Mac viamodem.andP;  Protocol transfers prevent most data errors, but this was anexception.andP;  Things went wild as soon as Mac Word 4.0 tried to repaginate.andM;The screen stayed blank, while the page counter started at 126 and just keptcounting.andP;  It got into the 190s (it was an eight-page document) before theprogram crashed.andM;The nice thing about software, of course, is that reincarnation takes only afew seconds.andP;  I turned off the background repagination (ironically, a featurethat Mac Word users have been demanding for years) and went on a cyanidehunt.andM;What I found was a fatal format.andP;  The right indent was now just over 17inches, leaving minus 10 inches for text; line spacing was a bit less than2,400 points (about 33 inches), making it impossible to put even one line ona page.andM;You or I would have given up right there, but no one told Word that peoplemight ask it to do the impossible; it marched steadfastly over the cliff,humming &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come,&quot; and hit the ground hard enough to windup six feet under.andM;I'm not going to call this a bug, because you can't create this conditionthrough any normal means.andP;  Word won't let me set a line spacing greater than432 points from the paragraph-format dialogue box, and even if I tighten thetop and bottom margins to leave less than that spacing, it puts the text inthe bottom margin anyway.andM;Even so, as software gets to be embedded in mission-critical applications, itseems to me that developers could do with a bit more constructive paranoia.andO;Data may be doing an end run around their carefully crafted routines thattrap most user errors; garbage may be going right into the gut as a stream ofbits from some other system, poisoned at the source by softwareincompatibility or spoiled during the trip by communication errors.andM;For your software, it's like the difference between eating a meal and gettinga blood transfusion: The transfer is more direct, but the program no longerhas its senses of vision and taste to help it judge what's safe to eat.andM;I'm reminded of the three laws of robotics, proposed by Isaac Asimov infictional works almost 40 years ago.andP;  &quot;A robot may not injure a human beingor allow a human being to come to harm; a robot must obey the orders given itby humans except where such orders would conflict with the First Law; a robotmust protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflictwith the First or Second Law.&quot;andM;If you replace the word &quot;robot&quot; with a looser term, &quot;system,&quot; you wind upwith a decent set of guidelines for software serving more than casual needs.andO;Consider automated teller machines: If a machine were to lose its mainframeconnection, it could simply shut down, but imagine the results if someonewere unable to get cab fare in the middle of the night and had to walk homethrough dangerous streets.andM;For this reason, some of these machines have a fallback mode that checks thelast date and balance recorded on your card's magnetic strip.andP;  The machinethen uses that information, imperfect though it may be, to decide whether togrant the withdrawal.andM;Granted, you may have cashed a check earlier that day and cleared out youraccount, but common sense and good business practice call for accepting thatrisk.andP;  This is a small but revealing example of First Law thinking.andM;First Law design will be driven by this kind of knowledge of the businessneed, and Second Law design is implicit in the way that software is specifiedand debugged.andP;  As systems do more work at machine speeds rather than in humantime, however, we need to demand that they take better care of themselves --Third Law design -- as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
