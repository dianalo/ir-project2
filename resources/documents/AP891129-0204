It was a sensational development in the scandal, which centerson the disbanded Recadi government agency. The case is part too ofa wave of corruption charges against the administration of formerPresident Jaime Lusinchi, who completed his five-year term inFebruary.   The country's Upper Court on Wednesday ordered the arrests offormer Cabinet ministers Hector Hurtado, who oversaw developmentand finance; Hector Meneses, from the development department;Manuel Azpurua of finance; and Modesto Freites of planning.   A warrant was also issued for Mauricio Garcia Araujo, formerpresident of the Venezuelan Central Bank.   The court also ordered the arrests of former Recadi directorEgdalia Bastardo, former Finance Vice Minister Jorge Garcia, andthree other officials.   The court had been expected to rule after state and municipalelections scheduled for Sunday.   ``The warrants were issued this afternoon and have already beenhanded to the police, who will be in charge of executing them,''said Judge Silvestre Ortiz Bucaram.   He gave no details of what the suspects were being charged with.   Lusinchi's successor, Carlos Andres Perez, is an old personaland political rival.   Meneses is reported to be in the United States seeking medicaltreatment for serious injuries he suffered in April, when he shothimself in the temple shortly after the Recadi investigation began.   In a letter found at his side, addressed to his wife, Menesesaccused Hurtado and Azpurua of trying to make him the scapegoat.   Recadi was the government agency charged with distributingdollars for imports at prices much lower than those of the generalmarket. It was set up in 1983 to soften the impact of thedevaluation of the national currency, the bolivar.   Perez eliminated Recadi and the preferential dollar systemshortly after his inauguration.   Dozens of companies are now under investigation, charged withfraudulently obtaining cheap Recadi dollars through overbilling ornon-existent imports. According to official figures, close to $7billion ended up in private and company accounts in the UnitedStates and Europe.   A few months ago, a lower court investigating the case orderedthe arrest of Argentine Finance Minister Nestor Rapanelli.   From 1984-85, Rapanelli headed Gramoven, a Venezuelan flourmill. He was charged with wheat contraband and exchange fraud.   In October, Lusinchi himself narrowly avoided a formalcongressional investigation when two consecutive votes ended in atie with the entire opposition voting against the governingDemocratic Action party.   In another case, Jose Angel Ciliberto, Lusinchi's last interiorminister, is being investigated by the prosecutor general forpossible misuse of public funds.</TEXT></DOC>
