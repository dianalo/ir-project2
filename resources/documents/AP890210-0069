The discovery, reported Thursday, confirms a theory that pulsarsare created by the explosion of enormous stars, called supernovas,said Carl Pennypacker, a research physicist at the Lawrence BerkeleyLaboratory.   The pulsar, a highly dense star known as a neutron star, spinsnearly 2,000 times per second, according to Pennypacker, who saidits speed is three times faster than anything researchers haveobserved before.   ``It's really phenomenal,'' he said, describing the pulsar as``something that has the mass of the sun squished down to a10-kilometer radius.''   The discovery offers key information into what happens when asupernova explodes, he said.   ``It tells us about the birth of pulsars and the final stage ofbig stars,'' Pennypacker said. ``It will probably change our senseof what the (supernova) explosion mechanism is. I think it's goingto have a pretty profound effect.''   Pennypacker, a researcher at LBL and the Space SciencesLaboratory at the University of California at Berkeley, said thepulsar emits light that creates ``sort of a searchlight effect.''   The pulsar's creation was observed as part of an internationalresearch project begun two years ago when astronomers first spottedthe parent supernova, named Supernova 1987A.   Located about 170,000 light-years away from the Earth, theexplosion of Supernova 1987A was much closer than any othersupernova explosion in four centuries. Observers were able to watchit with the naked eye for several months. Pennypacker called thatexplosion ``probably the most exciting astronomical observation ofthe decade.''   ``We barely have an understanding of what makes these starsexplode,'' he said. ``They're neat because all the atoms in us camefrom Supernova explosions. ... They're some of the brightest thingsin the universe; ancients watched them.''   When the big star's core collapsed in an enormous explosion, theneutron star was formed, he said.   The pulsar was detected inside the cloud of gas dust left by thesupernova in the Large Magellanic Cloud near the Milky Way galaxy.   Speculation about how fast the pulsar would spin had ranged fromtwo or three rotations per second to Pennypacker's guess that itwould spin at a rate of ``at least 100 times a second,'' but no onehad come close to anticipating the pulsar's spectacular speed.   The pulsar, which will likely keep researchers busy until atleast 1995, probably existed for about two years, but debris and foghave obscured its presence, Pennypacker said.   Astronomers in Chile gathered the first data that documented thediscovery Jan. 18, Pennypacker said, adding that a team of abouteight researchers has been interpreting the information since then.   More observations are expected soon from telescopes in Australiaand Chile, he said.   The team that discovered the pulsar included scientists from theLawrence Berkeley Laboratory, the Los Alamos National Laboratory,the Las Campanas and Cerro Tololo observatories in Chile, NASA'sAmes Research Center, the Mount Stromlo-Siding Springs Observatoryin Australia, and the Universities of Oregon and Toronto.</TEXT></DOC>
