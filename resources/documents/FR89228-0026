The FMP provides for designation of ARs and fish attractiondevices (FADs) as SMZs, in which specific gear and harvest limitationswould apply. An AR or FAD creates fishing opportunities that would not otherwise existand an AR may increase biological production. The cost of their constructionand maintenance can be substantial and their intended socioeconomic benefits(<T3>e.g., </T3>recreational fishing or tournaments) can be reduced or eliminatedif highly efficient fishing gear and fishing practices are not restrained.Therefore, designation of an AR or FAD as a SMZ acts as an incentive forconstruction. The Ft. Pierce Sportfishing Club (Club) requested the Council to establishSMZs around two ARs located in the Exclusive Economic Zone off the southeastcoast of Florida for which it holds a Corps of Engineers permit authorizingtheir construction. FADs are utilized with each AR. The Club requestedthat the following limitations be applied in these SMZs: (1) Prohibit useof fish traps; (2) prohibit use of bottom longlines; (3) prohibit use ofhydraulic and electric reels to fish for fish in the snapper-grouper fisheryunless the reels are mounted on hand-held (including rod holder) fishingrods; (4) prohibit spearfishing on the inshore reef; and (5) prohibit harvestor possession of jewfish.In accordance with the FMP, the Monitoring Team appointed by the Councilissued a report evaluating the Club's request, in the context of the FMP'scriteria of (1) fairness and equity, (2) promotion of conservation, and(3) prevention of excessive shares. The report also considered possibleconflicts among fishermen and impacts on historical uses. A discussionof these criteria was contained in the proposed rule (53 FR 32412, August25, 1988) and is not repeated here. After reviewing the Monitoring Team's report, supporting data, commentsduring public hearings, and other relevant information, the Council recommendedand the Director, Southeast Region, NMFS, concurred with the establishmentof the SMZs with the requested limitations. This final rule designatesthe two ARs as SMZs and, in order to (1) promote orderly use of the resource;(2) reduce potential user group conflicts; (3) maintain the intended socioeconomicbenefits of the ARs and thereby maintain incentives for the creation ofARs and FADs; (4) optimize the use of the biological production; and (5)create fishing opportunities that would not exist otherwise, imposes therequested restrictions on fishing gear and fishing practicers in the SMZs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and Responses </ITAG>NOAA received 13 written comments supporting the proposed rule from sportfishingclubs and organizations, a marina operator, a charter boat operator, andindividuals. These commentators expressed the need for restrictions on``highly efficient'' fishing gear to ensure that the intended benefitsof these artificial reefs are maintained. The Ft. Pierce Sportfishing Clubalso submitted additional rationale and information in support of the proposedSMZs. Two letters from a commercial fishermen's organization and one from anindividual objected to the proposed rule. Those commenters opposing theproposed rule raised a number of issues regarding artificial reefs andthe proposed SMZs. One commenter stated that there is no documentationthat the SMZs would promote conservation by optimizing social and economicbenefits. The proposed rule did not present quantitative economic analysisbut did present qualitative descriptions of social and economic benefits.Studies of artificial reefs in South Carolina and south Florida have producedestimates of economic benefits for those reefs and have documented socialbenefits in terms of increased fishing opportunities and participationrates. During the comment period, the Club provided additional qualitativedescriptions of the social and economic benefits for each restriction proposedfor the SMZs. Further, few, if any, historical users will be adverselyimpacted by the proposed action. NOAA believes there is an adequate basisto conclude benefits will exceed costs. Two commenters suggested that artificial reefs only aggregate fish fromsurrounding areas, and one stated that this may increase catchability andfishing mortality. The issue of whether artificial reefs actually increasefish production or simply attract fish from adjacent areas has not beenresolved conclusively. There is some scientific evidence supporting eachposition. However, the two functions are not mutually exclusive. It appearsthat there may be a number of factors influencing the relative importanceof production versus aggregation, including: Availability of natural habitat,degree of the fish's dependence on reef habitat, exploitation rates, andthe mechanism of natural population limitation (e.g., recruitment versushabitat). Although artifical reefs may increase catchability, the proposedgear restrictions within the SMZs will reduce potential fishing mortality.Minumum size limits applicable to all participants in the fishery willalso limit fishing mortality. One commenter stated that there has been no record of conflict or evidencethat any of the prohibited gears has caused a problem. NOAA agrees; however,there is some evidence that these gear types, especially fish traps, havethe potential to deplete fish populations from localized areas, includingartifical reefs. The proposed restrictions are intended to prevent suchproblems from occurring. Because there has been no significant use of theprohibited gear at the proposed sites and, therefore, will be no impacton historical uses, NOAA believes that the proposed action is justifiable.The difficulties of enforcing restrictions in these small geographic areaswas also raised as an issue. NOAA acknowledges that enforcement may bedifficult but concludes that the combined enforcement capabilities of theNMFS, U.S. Coast Guard, and Florida, in addition to anticipated cooperationfrom users of the SMZs, should provide a reasonable level of enforcement.One commenter representing some of the shrimping industry in northeastFlorida claimed that the SMZs would hinder access to their traditionalfishing grounds. The two artificial reef sites were permitted by the Corpsof Engineers in 1984, and placement of reef materials began in 1985. Itis possible that construction of the artifical reefs may have affectedaccess to fishing grounds, but this proposed action, establishing SMZson these permitted sites, would not have any additional effect on access.Trawling in the SMZs, though probably impractical, is not prohibited. All commenters objecting to the proposed rule expressed a general concernabout the potential proliferation of SMZs. One suggested that no SMZs beapproved until it is determined whether artificial reefs and fish attractingdevices contribute to overfishing. Although the number of artificial reefsis increasing rapidly, especially in Florida, the procedure in the FMPfor establishing SMZs provides for thorough evaluation of each request.Requests are reviewed on a case-by-case basis; criteria for evaluationinclude fairness and equity, consideration of effects on natural habitatand historical uses, and other factors; and thorough public review is affordedthrough public hearings and public comment periods. NOAA believes thatthis process will result in rational development of SMZs. However, NOAAand the Council agree that additional consideration of the impacts of artificialreefs and SMZs would be beneficial. The Council will proceed with a reevaluationof the SMZ concept in the near future. <ITAG tagnum="84">Changes from the Proposed Rule </ITAG>In the proposed rule, in andSection; 646.24(a)(21), the latitude and longitudespecifications for point B were incorrect. The last two digits, showinghundredths of minutes of latitude and longitude, were inverted. This finalrule corrects the non-substantive error. <ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Change</ITAG>In andSection; 646.24(a)(1), the coordinates for the Little River Reef SMZare listed in incorrect order. This rule corrects the error and revisesfor clarity the format for showing the points designating the SMZ. <ITAG tagnum="84">Classification </ITAG>The Under Secretary for Oceans and Atmosphere, NOAA, (Under Secretary)determined that this rule is necessary for the conservation and managementof the snapper-grouper fishery and that it is consistent with the MagnusonAct and other applicable law. This action is categorically excluded from the requirement to prepare anenvironmental assessment by NOAA Directive 02-10. These measures are partof the Federal action for which an environmental impact statement (EIS)was prepared. The final EIS for the FMP was filed with the EnvironmentalProtection Agency and the notice of availability was published on August19, 1983 (48 FR 37702). The Under Secretary determined that this rule is not a major rule requiringa regulatory impact analysis under E.O. 12291. This rule is not likelyto result in an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; amajor increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; ora significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets. The Councilprepared a regulatory impact review for this rule. A summary of the economiceffects was included in the proposed rule and is not repeated here. The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the SmallBusiness Administration that this rule will not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. The basis for this determinationwas included in the proposed rule and is not repeated here. As a result,a regulatory flexibility analysis was not prepared. This rule does not contain a collection-of-information requirement forpurposes of the Paperwork Reduction Act. The Council determined that this rule does not directly affect the coastalzone of any State with an approved coastal zone management program. Florida,the only state involved, agreed with this determination. This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under E.O. 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 646 </ITAG>Fisheries, Fishing.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 22, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
