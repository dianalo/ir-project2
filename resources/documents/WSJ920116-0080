The chip maker said net income rose to $188.7 million, or90 cents a share, compared with $163.9 million, or 80 cents ashare, in the year-earlier quarter. Revenue rose 15% to $1.21billion from $1.05 billion.</LP><TEXT>   Andrew S. Grove, chief executive officer and president,said increasing sales of Intel's new generation 486 and 386SL chips used in personal computers contributed to much ofthe company's success.   The assault on Intel's dominance in the chip market byAdvanced Micro Devices Inc., Sunnyvale, Calif., which is alsoselling a 386 chip, had &quot;a very minor impact&quot; on revenue, anIntel spokesman said. Sales of Intel's older 386 chip droppedslightly because customers were switching to the newer chips,he said.   The chip maker's international sales in 1991 exceeded U.S.sales for the first time, with sales in Europe growing tomore than $1 billion. Intel said that previously, sales inEurope usually accounted for about 25% of its business, withAsia accounting for about 25%, and the U.S. about 50%.   Mr. Grove said he foresees continuing success in 1992,with increases in sales for new products such as multimediaprocessors and supercomputers. Intel will invest about $2billion for research and development and new plants andequipment in 1992, he said.   Intel's growing chip sales and earnings will probablycontinue through 1992, said Tom Thornhill, an analyst atMontgomery Securities. &quot;The market is rolling continuallytoward their higher-end products,&quot; he said.   For the year, Intel's profit jumped 26% to $818.6 million,or $3.92 a share, compared with $650.3 million, or $3.20 ashare, a year earlier. Revenue grew 22% to $4.78 billion,compared with $3.92 billion.   Intel closed at $56, up $1.50, in nationalover-the-counter trading yesterday.</TEXT></DOC>
