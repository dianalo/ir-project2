The two sides line up on either side of the KupaRiver, calm and beautiful in the winter sunlight save for thesporadic bursts of firing across the water. The opposingsides are so close the soldiers can almost see into eachother's eyes through their rifle scopes as they shoot atpeople they have hated for centuries. And when the people arescarce, they take aim at the buildings -- the more beautiful,the more sacred, the better. Churches are always the first togo.   Despite deep ideological, cultural and religiousdifferences between Serbs and Croats, this, in many ways, isan army's war. The Belgrade government of President SlobodanMilosevic is quickly losing control of an army that isfighting for its own privileges, its pensions, its share ofpower. &quot;Everything the world feared would happen with the RedArmy in Russia is taking place here in Croatia&quot; says Croatianjournalist Kresimir Dzeba. &quot;The army has become a force untoitself with its own raison d'etre.&quot; As the fifth largest armyin Europe, it is too big to retire.</LP><TEXT>   For the moment, Serbian soldiers are slowly fighting theirway across southern Croatia, shelling everything and everyonein sight. It is easy to see why they already control morethan a third of Croatian territory. The army has theadvantage over the Croatian militia in war toys forgrown-ups: planes, tanks and a variety of mortars, rocketsand artillery. The Croatians, on the other hand, have nothingbut guns -- some of them hunting rifles and World WarII-issue machine guns. A makeshift bunker on a hillsideoverlooking the Kupa River defends itself against mortars andsniper fire from chetniks with a lone machine-gun, &quot;still thebest gun that money can buy,&quot; a soldier says with pride.   Of course, Croatia receives help from some odd quarters:arms shipments from Hungary and Austria and a variety offormer legionnaires from France, volunteers from Sweden andthree Englishmen and a Japanese who have brought their tankto the eastern Croatian town of Osijek, besieged on threesides by federal troops. The tank is useless because none ofthe volunteers speaks Croatian and so are unable to plantheir activities with the Croatians, whose English is usuallyminimal at best. These quixotic gestures make betterliterature than war; if the war were a play instead of thereal thing, it would be a tragedy of comic errors.   Despite the comic touches -- the soldiers dressing up inwigs to have their pictures taken or playing football duringa lull in the fighting -- the war is a tragedy for Croatia.At least 10,000 people have been killed and more than 500,000have been displaced in the fighting, either of their own freewill after days of sustained shelling have destroyed theirhomes and villages, or because they have been herded out oftheir hiding places by Serbian irregulars, draped in capturedCroatian flags. Some of the oldest, most fragile Croatiansstay on; an old lady in Komarevo shows off the craters madeby Serbian shells lobbed over the hillside into her frontyard. Serbian snipers in the woods behind her house shoot atanything that moves, usually a pig or a chicken, but sherefuses to go.   In Brest, the only remaining villager lives a few yardsfrom the front. So far, she has managed to evade the bulletsand shells that have pockmarked this oncebeautiful village ofwooden farmhouses. Rocket launchers have left the woodenchurch of St. Barbara in tatters. But on a calm day ofsporadic shooting, the village stands eerily silent andserene in the late afternoon sun, abandoned save for thechickens and a black dog. Croatian soldiers are holed up in afarmhouse that looks out upon the Croatian town of Petrinjaon the other side of the Kupa River, now occupied by Serbianswho fire into Brest from what remains of the town's Baroquechurch.   Like most wars, the waiting is almost as bad as the battleand the improvised bunker is too close to the front to allowthe Croatians the luxury of a game of football. While theywait for the shelling to resume, they hang out in a fetidbedroom of the farmhouse, singing Croatian nationalist songsand eating cookies baked by a woman in Zagreb. The same womanhas supplied soldiers all over the villages of the centralfront with cookies; a similar box with the same handwritinglay on a table of a farmhouse-cum-bunker in Komarevo.   After the cookies and brandy are served, it's down tobusiness: a soldier fondles a Kalashnikov from Hungary thatis slung on his hip and wonders why the U.S. and WesternEurope will not do something to help so obvious an underdog.I reply that their situation would be vastly improved by thediscovery of huge reserves of oil, comparable to theunderground lakes in Kuwait. Despite their limited Englishand my non-existent Croatian, we understand one another.   From Zagreb to Komarevo to Karlovac, the Croats worry overtheir isolation from the rest of Europe. They feel European.Their history and culture are European. Yet, save for Germanyand the countries bordering the old Yugoslavia, mostgovernments in Europe seem strangely indifferent to the onebattle fought on its territory in 45 years.   Plainly, the &quot;two Europes&quot; that civil servants worry aboutincessantly in Brussels are being played out right here inCroatia, where one Europe chooses to ignore the suffering ofthe other. Curiously, that other Europe of luxury, comfortand calm is sometimes present, even in battle. At one pointduring heavy shelling in the old city of Karlovac, half ofwhich has been destroyed over the past five months, a soldierturns to me as I crouch in a bunker, thinking idly of lifeand limb. &quot;Your perfume&quot; he says in hesitant English. &quot;I knowit.
