Shultz hasdecided to help Israel hold on to Soviet Jews who might prefersettling in America, according to U.S. officials.   He will not oppose a prospective change in Israeli proceduresdesigned to stem the exodus to the United States of Jews who leftthe Soviet Union with exit permits for Israel, the officials saidFriday.   But Shultz is likely to heed the advice of the bureaus thathandle Soviet and refugee affairs and keep pushing Moscow to permitwider emigration across the board.   Most Jews who leave the Soviet Union are permitted to depart ifthey can get visas from Israel. Once they reach Vienna, the transitpoint for Soviet emigres, nearly 90 percent of them go elsewhere,mostly to the United States and are taken in by the United Statesas refugees.   Concerned about the situation, the Israeli Cabinet has ordered achange in procedures. Soviet Jews granted exit permits wouldreceive their Israeli visas in Romania and fly to Israel.   The change in procedure, which has not been put into effect,would make it harder for Soviet Jews to come to the United Statesbecause they would have to qualify for entry as immigrants. Thiscould require long waiting periods and most would be fenced out forvarious reasons as ineligible.   The State Department's European bureau, which is involved inSoviet policy, and the Human Rights Bureau had both recommended toShultz that he urge Israel to change its policy and appeal toMoscow to permit wider emigration.   Richard Schifter, the assistant secretary of state for HumanRights and Humanitarian Affairs, proposed that Soviet Jews remaineligible for admission to the United States as refugees even afterthey reach Israel.   The State Department's Near Eastern bureau, which deals in Araband Israeli affairs, recommended to Shultz that he not contest theIsraeli Cabinet's decision _ advice he will follow, at leasttemporarily, according to officials who spoke on the condition theynot be identified.   ``The debate is less a State Department debate than a debateabout feeling the Israelis would be insulted and that it wouldundermine the purpose of the State of Israel if refugees left theSoviet Union and did not go to Israel,'' an official said. ``Theyneed and want immigrants.''   David A. Harris, the Washington representative of the AmericanJewish Committee, described the problem as ``one of the hottest andmost complex issues in Israeli-Diaspora debate.'' He referred todivergent views among Jews living in Israel and elsewhere aroundthe world.   ``Ideally,'' Harris said, ``the compromise would be a two-trackpolicy. Soviet Jews who want to go to Israel would leave theU.S.S.R. with Israeli visas. Those seeking resettlement in theUnited States would leave with American visas. It is our hope theadministration will press the Kremlin in this direction. It's fair,it's equitable, its logical.''   Most Soviet citizens are unable to obtain exit permits. Butthousands of Jews, Armenians and ethnic Germans over the years haveenjoyed a special privilege of emigrating. Very small numbers ofJews are permitted to go directly to the United States. The otherscan leave only if they obtain visas for Israel.</TEXT></DOC>
