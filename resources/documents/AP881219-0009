But Argentina's military remains restive, and no one ispredicting that the third insurrection in 20 months against thecivilian government of President Raul Alfonsin will be the last.   ``The military crisis was resolved, not the military question,''says Antonio Berhongaray, chairman of the Senate Defense Committee.``There could be another insurrection.''   Government officials have worked since the four-day revolt endedDec. 4 to assess the loyalty of army units _ some of which openlysided with the rebels, and others which refused to confront them _and to meet some of the rebel demands.   A general who publicly sympathized with rebel commander Col.Mohamed Ali Seineldin was retired, and the government hastily puttogether funds to give soldiers a 20 percent pay increase and aChristmas bonus.   That may reduce tensions in the ranks, but it doesn't address theroot of the problem, say some prominent Argentines. Many in themilitary want an end to human rights trials of officers for theirroles in a campaign of repression during the 1976-83 militarydictatorship.   They want a better role in society for the military, which lostthe 1982 Falklands War and led Argentina into economic chaos duringits rule.   But Argentina's military has toppled six civilian leaders since1930, and some say it has never learned its place in society.   ``The point is, the central point is, the military does notrespond to civilian political power,'' says Adolfo Perez Esquivel,director of the human rights group Peace and Justice Service andwinner of the 1980 Nobel Peace Prize.   In an interview at his sparsely furnished office, Perez Esquivelreferred to one of the last incidents of the rebellion and said,``Right in front of `loyal' troops, `rebels' fired tear gas and shotat civilians.''   ``There aren't `loyal' troops. They're all accomplices of therebels,'' he said, his voice devoid of stridency or anger. ``Theyshare the same ideology. They only differ in method. Some wereagainst the insurrection, some wanted to work through the politicalsystem.''   On Dec. 12, the commander of the 5th army corps, Gen. HumbertoFerrucci, confirmed the suspicions of many when he said theinsurrection ended with an agreement between army chief Lt. Gen.Jose Dante Caridi and Seineldin.   There is widespread doubt that loyal troops ``suffocated'' therebellion, as Alfonsin ordered them to do, but instead reached anagreement with the rebels, the terms of which have yet to bedisclosed.   That prospect unsettles, among others, Elias Robert Salazar,president of the 8,000-member Buenos Aires Lawyers Association.   Asked if the end of the rebellion meant democracy in Argentinawas strengthened, or the institution of the presidency wasfortified, Salazar shook his head from side to side and said:   ``I think the situation of civilian political power is worsebecause the armed forces demonstrated that they are loyal tothemselves and not to the president and commander-in-chief(Alfonsin).   ``The conclusion I draw is that the military doesn't want powerright now because the situation is not favorable. They would berepudiated by the people and economically, they would be taking overa situation that would not allow them to govern. ... They don't wantpower, but they want to give the orders.''   Their demand for a recuperation of military honor and dignity,which had widespread resonance through the ranks, was areaffirmation of the military view that the battle to curtail thekidnappings, bombings and assassinations of the 1970s was a civilwar.   A speech Saturday by Defense Minister Horacio Jaunarena supportedthat view. Jaunarena said the campaign, through brutal, wasnecessary.   The view of human rights groups and others is that the arrest,``disappearance'' and presumed execution of 9,000 Argentines was abrutal repression of society.   Alfonsin has portrayed the end of the rebellion as a clear-cutvictory in which organized labor, big business, foreign governmentsand tens of thousands of Argentines who gathered in plazas toprotest the insurrection forced the rebels to give in.   But the opposition Peronist Party, with an eye to May 1989national elections, is criticizing Alfonsin for his handling of therevolt, and demanding he develop a policy toward the military thatreduces the risk of another revolt.   Asked what effect the insurrection might have in the election,pollster Manuel Mora y Araujo said, ``We're asking ourselves that,but so far we don't know ... It hasn't ended.''</TEXT></DOC>
