Introduction and Background</ITAG>The Office of Thrift Supervision (the ``Office'') is today, purusant tothe requirement of section 5(t) of the Home Owners' Loan Act, 12 U.S.C.1464(t), promulgating uniformly applicable capital regulations for savingsassociations. These capital regulations are another step in the processof establishing the minimum capital requirements for savings associationsin order to promote the long-term health of both individual thrift institutionsand the thrift industry as a whole. The Office expects that savings associationswill strive to attain and maintain levels of capital in excess of theserequirements.Adequate capital is essential to the safe and sound operation of a savingsassociation. It ensures that the owners, managers, and subordinated lendersof a savings association have a significant incentive to avoid loss aswell as maximize gains. It is especially important that levels of capitalbe related to the risk of the activities in which a savings associationengages. Linking the amount of an association's capital requirement tothe overall riskiness of its assets is a more accurate method of ensuringthat the association can afford to cover losses that may arise from suchactivities without becoming insolvent. This risk-based approach has beenadopted by the federal banking regulators and is consistent with the internationalframework for capital standards established by the Basle Committee on BankingSupervision (commonly referred to as the ``Basle Supervisors Committee'')in July, 1988.Activities that potentially have higher returns generally have such potentialbecause of their higher risk of loss. Because higher risk/return activitiescan exhaust a savings association's capital faster than lower risk/returnactivities, savings associations engaging in higher risk activities shouldhold more capital to protect the federal deposit insurance fund and toprovide appropriate incentives for prudent management. Likewise, institutionsthat engage in lower risk activities do not need as large a capital cushionand should be permitted to operate with a lower minimum capital requirement,consistent with protection of the insurance fund and the long-term safetyof the thrift industry and the individual savings association.The Office believes that savings associations operating with adequate capitalhave more incentive and are better positioned to evaluate the potentialrisks and rewards inherent in various activities. Thus, an associationoperating with more than minimum amounts of capital may be permitted awider range of activities without as much direct regulatory restriction,subject only to supervisory review.A. 12/88 ProposalOn December 15, 1988, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board (``Bank Board''or ``Board'') issued a risk-based capital proposal (``12/88 proposal''),which it promulgated for a ninety-day public comment period. Board Res.No. 88-1342, 53 FR 51800 (Dec. 23, 1988). The Bank Board held public hearingson this proposal on February 9 and 10, 1989. The Office reopened the commentperiod on this proposal from September 12, 1989, to September 22, 1989,in order to allow additional public comment on the effect of the FinancialInstitutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989, Public LawNo. 101-73, 103 Stat. 183, (``FIRREA''), on this proposal. 54 FR 37944(Sept. 14, 1989).The Bank Board had also adopted two advance notices of proposed rulemakingon capital-related issues: (1) A standard for early regulatory interventionthat would allow appointment of a conservator or receiver when a thriftinstitution is operating with substantially insufficient capital, 54 FR826 (Dec. 30, 1988); and (2) an interest-rate risk component as part ofa risk-based capital regulation, 54 FR 27885 (July 3, 1989). The Bank Boarddid not issue notices of proposed rulemaking on either issue. The Officebelieves both rulemakings should proceed. Thus, notices of proposed rulemakingon these issues will be published in the near future. Any changes adoptedas a result of these or other related rulemakings will be incorporatedinto final capital regulations.The 12/88 proposal was based in large part upon the joint notice of proposedguidelines published in March, 1988, by the Federal Reserve Board (``FRB''),the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC''), and the FederalDeposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC'') (Collectively, ``banking regulators''or ``banking agencies'') (``Joint Notice''), 53 FR 8550 (March 15, 1988)as supplemented by the final action of the Basle Supervisors Committeein July 1988 and indications in August 1988 of the way in which the bankingagencies would resolve certain issues raised by the Joint Notice.The 12/88 proposal would require savings associations to maintain capitalagainst two risks: (1) Credit risk (which is primarily the risk that adebtor may default, causing a decline in value or loss on an investment);and (2) interest-rate risk (which is primarily the risk that changes ininterest rates may cause the value of a thrift's asset and liability portfolioto decline). In addition, the proposal included a collateralized borrowingscomponent designed to help protect the insurance fund against uncompensatedrisk that occurs because insurance premiums are levied against insureddeposits rather than assets or total liabilities.The Bank Board proposed that savings associations maintain capital in theamount of: (1) No less than 6% of risk-weighted assets (including bothon- and off-balance sheet items) as protection against credit risk; (2)50% of the change in the market value of the thrift's portfolio equityas a result of a two-hundred basis point shift in interest rates; and (3)3% of collateralized borrowings. This capital requirement could only besatisfied by items falling within the definition of ``regulatory capital.''As proposed, regulatory capital consisted of core equity capital, primarilycapital as defined by generally accepted accounting principles (``GAAP''),and supplementary capital, which contained certain other items that theBank Board also believed would provide protection against risk or wererequired by statute or prior regulation to be included. The 12/88 proposalrequired that a thrift use ``core equity capital'' to satisfy at leastone-half of its capital requirement. In addition to this risk-based capitalrequirement, the proposal set for savings associations a leverage ratiorequirement; the leverage ratio of 2% of core equity capital to total assets.B. FIRREAOn August 9, 1989, the FIRREA was enacted. It established the Office asthe primary federal banking regulator for all savings associations andsavings and loan holding companies. It abolished the Bank Board effective60 days after the statute's enactment. Section 401(h) of the FIRREA providedthat orders, resolutions, determinations, and regulations of the Bank Boardin effect on the date of FIRREA's enactment were to remain in effect untilmodified, terminated, set aside, or superseded in accordance with applicablelaw by the appropriate successor agency. The Bank Board's notice of proposedrulemaking on regulatory capital is such a resolution and the Office hassucceeded to that notice.Section 301 of the FIRREA amended the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933 (``HOLA''),by adding a new section 5(t), 12 U.S.C. 1464(t),\1\<NOTE/> requiring the Office to promulgate, by November 7, 1989,regulations prescribing uniformly applicable capital standards for allsavings associations. These regulations must be effective by December 7,1989. Section 5(t) contains a number of provisions affecting the contentof these capital standards, establishes transition rules for certain provisions,and sets forth certain consequences of failure to meet these standards.Most of these provisions are discussed in greater detail below in partsI.C., II, and III.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Hereafter, the statutory capital provisions will be citedby reference to the appropriate sections of the HOLA.New section 5(t) requires the Office to establish uniform capital standardsthat require savings associations to satisfy three separate tests: A risk-basedcapital standard, a leverage ratio standard, and a tangible capital standard.Section 5(t)(1)(A). All three standards must be no less stringent thanthe capital standards applicable to national banks. Section 5(t)(1)(C).The risk-based capital standard, however, may deviate from the nationalbank risk-based capital standards ``to reflect interest-rate risk or otherrisks, but such deviations shall not, in the aggregate, result in materiallylower levels of capital being required of savings associations'' than wouldbe required under the OCC standards. Section 5(t)(2)(C).The statute requires the Office to use the same relevant substantive definitionsas the OCC in these capital standards, with certain exceptions where thestatute itself defines terms. Section 5(t) (9), (10). The statute containsspecific provisions mandating the regulatory treatment of qualifying supervisorygoodwill (section 5(t)(3)), purchased mortgage servicing rights (section5(t)(4)), and subsidiaries of savings associations (section 5(t)(5)), includingcertain transition provisions. The statute also sets forth certain consequencesof failure to meet these capital standards and allows savings associationsto apply for exceptions and exemptions from some of these consequences.Section 5(t) (6), (7), (8).C. Outline of regulation<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Structure of Capital Regulations</ITAG>The Office has reorganized and relocated its capital regulations, whichappeared at andSection;andSection; 561.13, 563.13, 563.14, 563.14-1, and 563.47at the time of the 12/88 proposal, into a new part 567. It believes thisnew structure will make it easier for those applying or subject to thesecapital regulations to determine and understand their content.New andSection; 567.1 contains definitions of terms used in the capital standardsand is derived from andSection; 563.13(b) of the 12/88 proposal, section5(t) of the HOLA, and 12 CFR part 3, appendix A, section 1(c). New andSection;567.2 sets forth the three-part capital tests that savings associationsmust satisfy and the transition period to the full phase-in of these standards.It is derived from former 12 CFR 563.13(a) (1988), andSection; 563.13 (c)and (f) of the 12/88 proposal, and section 5(t)(1) of the HOLA. Correspondingsections in the OCC's final guidelines are located in sections 1(a), 1(b),and 4 of 12 CFR part 3, appendix A.The permissible components of a savings association's capital base, includingwhich items qualify as core capital, which items qualify as supplementarycapital, and which items must be deducted in determining the savings association'scapital base for purposes of the risk-based and leverage ratio standardsare set forth in new andSection; 567.5. This section is derived from andSection;561.13 of the 12/88 proposal and corresponds to 12 CFR part 3, appendixA, section 2.The credit risk categories that are used in determining a savings association'srisk-weighted assets appear at andSection; 567.6. They have been derivedfrom andSection; 563.13(d) of the 12/88 proposal and section 3 of 12 CFRpart 3, appendix A.Section 567.8 contains the leverage ratio required by section 5(t)(2)(A)of the HOLA. It replaces the leverage ratio proposed at andSection; 563.13(c)(2)of the 12/88 proposal. Section 467.9 sets forth the tangible capital requirementas set forth at section 5(t)(2)(B) of the HOLA and the calculation of thecapital base for this requirement.Section 567.10 contains the statutorily mandated consequences of a savingsassociation's failure to meet any of its regulatory capital requirements.It is derived from section 5(t)(6) of the HOLA and andSection; 563.13(g)of the 12/88 proposal. Section 567.11, which reserves certain authorityfor the Office, is derived from andSection; 563.13(i) of the 12/88 proposaland 12 CFR 3.4.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Derivation of Capital Regulations</ITAG>This rule contains elements that are specifically mandated by new section5(t), elements that appeared in the Bank Board's 12/88 proposal, and elementsthat appeared in the OCC's final capital guidelines of January 27, 1989.The FIRREA capital provisions are the basic, guiding text for the Office'srisk-based capital rule. With respect to any capital provisions not directlyaddressed in the statute itself, FIRREA requires the Office to use theOCC's capital standards as its benchmark for the standards it prescribes.The Bank Board had already taken the OCC's proposed capital guidelines,along with those of the other banking regulators, as its model for the12/88 proposal. Much of the 12/88 proposal therefore anticipated FIRREA'srequirement that thrift capital standards derive, in large measure, formthose adopted by the OCC for national banks. Most of the changes form the12/88 proposal fall into the following categories:a. <T3>Statutory resolution of an issue.</T3> Section 5(t) of the HOLA requiresthe deduction of certain items from a savings association's capital base,such as goodwill, certain other intangible assets, and investments in certainsubsidiaries. The statute also requires the consolidation of the assetsof other subsidiaries in determining the savings association's capitalrequirements. It also provides that some assets must meet certain characteristics,often tied to the treatment of such assets by other banking regulators,most often the OCC, in order to qualify for special statutory treatment.b. <T3>Revisions based upon the OCC's treatment of an issue in its final guidelines.</T3>Section 5(t) of the HOLA establishes the OCC's final risk-based capitalguidelines as a benchmark for the Office's risk-based capital regulations.These final guidelines reflect certain changes from the Joint Notice. TheOffice has followed these final guidelines in resolving differences inmost areas where the 12/88 proposal differed from the Joint Notice, suchas the risk-weighting of Government National Mortgage Association (``GNMA'')securities and the components of core capital. c. <T3>Revisions based upon responses to comments or the Office's experience.</T3>Section 5(t) does not require the Office's risk-based capital regulationto be identical to the OCC's final capital guidelines. It specificallypermits the Office to address different risks and to resolve certain issuesdifferently from the OCC, provided that the Office's regulations are materiallyequivalent to the OCC's final guidelines and, thus, the capital standardsapplied to the thrift industry are no less stringent ``in the aggregate''than those applied to national banks. The FIRREA Conference Report explicitlystated: ``Both banking and thrift regulators have devoted considerableeffort to the mutual development of risk-based capital standards. Theseefforts have demonstrated that the initial standards will evolve and berefined over time as the regulators and the regulated institutions gainexperience with the appropriate standards applicable to the various investmentsmade by depository institutions.'' H.R. Rpt. 101-222 (Aug. 4, 1989). The Office has, therefore, reviewed the 12/88 proposal, the comments receivedthereon, and the supervisory experience of the Office's predecessor agencyin addition to the OCC's final guidelines in addressing certain issues.As a result, it is assigning higher risk weights to some assets (such asloans ninety days past due and repossessed assets) and is assigning lowerrisk weights to others (such as privately issued mortgage-back securitiesof investment grade) than the OCC. The Office believes that all of the issues resolved in this rule have beenadequately aired for public notice and comment as required by the AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 552, through the initial 90-day comment periodon the 12/88 proposal (during which two days of public hearings were held)as well as the eight-day reopening of the comment period (during whichthe Office held another public hearing) after FIRREA was enacted. Becausesection 5(t)(1) requires the Office to adopt a final capital regulationnot later than 90 days after enactment of FIRREA, there was not adequatetime to both provide a longer comment period and comply with this statutorydeadline. The Office invites additional comments, however, on this rule,and will consider any such comments in determining whether future revisionsare appropriate. Additionally, where the regulation indicates that supervisoryguidance will be provided to supplement portions of these regulations,the Office welcomes comments on matters that will be addressed in suchguidance. The Office anticipates publishing in the near future two notices of proposedrulemaking_one dealing with the appropriate risk-weighting of residentialmortgage-related products and one dealing with interest-rate risk_whichit anticipates will result in deviations from the OCC's final guidelines.It anticipates that any such deviations will better address the particularrisks most common in thrift portfolios than would the OCC's final capitalguidelines, which were crafted to address primarily the risks inherentin national bank portfolios. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Substantive Content of Capital Regulation. </ITAG>The rule published today establishes three standards that a savings associationmust satisfy in order to meet its capital requirement: A leverage ratioof core capital to adjusted total assets, a tangible capital standard expressedas a percentage of adjusted total assets, and a risk-based capital standardexpressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets. Currently, the risk-basedcapital standard only addresses the credit risk inherent in the assetsin a thrift's portfolio. There are other risks that are inherent in savingsassociations and their portfolios, even where assets may present little,if any, credit risk, such as operating risk, liquidity risk, and risk offraud. The leverage and tangible capital requirements are intended to ensurethat no matter how free from credit risk a savings association may be,it must maintain a minimum amount of capital measured in terms of its totalassets as protection against these risks. A savings association's risk-based capital requirement is calculated basedon the credit risk presented by both its on-balance sheet assets and off-balancesheet commitments and obligations. With certain limited exceptions, theasset base of a savings association is determined on a consolidated basis,<T3>i.e.,</T3> including its subsidiaries. Assets are assigned a credit-riskweighting based upon their relative risk. Risk weights are generally tiedto the nature of the underlying obligor. The risk-weightings range from 0% for assets backed by the full faith andcredit of the United States or that pose no credit risk to the savingsassociation to 200% for delinquent or repossessed assets. Certain assets,such as equity investments after a limited phase-out period, are not includedin the calculation of either the risk-based assets or the capital baseof a savings association. In other words, certain assets require dollar-for-dollarcapital backing. The Office recognizes that such treatment may encouragethrifts to put certain assets in a subsidiary where their investment maybe levered. The degree of leverage, however, is determined by investorsin the subsidiary who can evaluate the risk. The Office believes that itis more appropriate for the market (at the subsidiary level), rather thanthe regulator (at the parent level), to determine the capital requiredto back certain risky assets.Off-balance sheet commitments are converted to a ``credit equivalent''amount by using a conversion factor intended to estimate the likelihoodthat the contingent obligation will result in an actual obligation of thesavings association and the potential size of loss such items may resultin. That amount is then risk-weighted according to the risk associatedwith the underlying obligor, just as an on-balance sheet asset would be.The amount of risk-weighted assets will then be multiplied by a creditrisk capital requirement to determine the minimum amount of capital requiredfor that savings association. That requirement is phased-in over a limitednumber of years on a schedule similar to the one that will be effect fornational banks.Today's regulations, unlike the 12/88 proposal, do not contain capitalrequirements based upon a savings association's level of interest-raterisk or the amount of collateralized borrowings it holds. As indicatedabove, the interest-rate risk capital requirement will be addressed ina separate notice of proposed rulemaking. The Office intends to adjustthe amount of capital that must be held against credit risk at the timeit adopts an interest-rate risk requirement so that the overall risk-basedcapital requirement for the thrift industry, including credit and interest-raterisk components will be no less stringent than the minimum capital requirementimposed on national banks.Section 1001 of FIRREA requires a study of the federal deposit insurancesystem to review the issue of whether collateralized borrowings shouldbe added to the deposit insurance base. The Office believes that collateralizedborrowings should, therefore, not be addressed in its capital rule at thistime.The rule also sets forth the items that count as capital and that may beused to satisfy the risk-based capital requirement. ``Core capital'' \2\<NOTE/> includes items of a more permanent nature, such as commonstockholders' equity and retained earnings. Certain other items providea somewhat lesser degree of protection, often because of their nonpermanentnature or their imposition of fixed obligations. These items are considered``supplementary capital.'' \3\<NOTE/> Together, the sum of core and supplementary capital equala savings association's ``total capital.''<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Core capital is equivalent to OCC's Tier 1 capital asset forth in its final guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Supplementary capital is equivalent to the OCC's Tier2 capital as set forth in its guidelines.Although both core and supplementary capital may be used in meeting therisk-based capital requirement, the amount of supplementary capital thatmay be counted toward that requirement is limited to the amount of theassociation's core capital. Additional limits are placed upon certain typesof supplementary capital, such as hybrid capital instruments that havesome characteristics of both debt and equity and general loan and leasevaluation loss allowances. These limits may restrict the extent to whichthese forms of supplementary capital may be used to satisfy the savingsassociation's capital requirement. Items that are deducted from a savingsassociation's asset base in determining its assets are also necessarilydeducted from its capital since capital equals assets minus liabilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Summary of Comments</ITAG>The Office received a total of 375 comment letters from 307 different commenters.Many commenters submitted more than one comment letter during the rulemakingprocess. Those who submitted comments included: 207 savings associationsand related companies; 34 trade associations; 11 law firms; 9 investmentbanking firms; 6 consultants; 6 mortgage insurance companies; 4 governmentcorporations or agencies; 4 industry-related companies; 3 multilaterallending institutions; one commercial bank; and one certified public accountingfirm. Also received were 14 comments from students in a college financialintermediations class, one comment from a law firm representing creditcard companies and one comment from a ratings service. Although commentsreceived before August 8, 1989 addressed the Bank Board and those receivedafter that date addressed the Office, this summary will, for consistency,refer throughout to the Office.A. Credit Risk WeightingsThe overwhelming majority of commenters supported the 12/88 proposal tomove to a capital requirement primarily based on a risk-weighted assetbase. Commenters focused their attention on specific risk weightings assummarized below.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Full Faith and Credit Obligations</ITAG>The 12/88 proposal placed obligations backed by the full faith and creditof the U.S. Government or its agencies in the 0% risk-weight category,except for mortgage-backed securities. As noted in the preamble to the12/88 proposal, this treatment could lead to an anomaly whereby mortgagesguaranteed by the Veterans Administration and Federal Housing Administration(``VA/FHA''), as federal agencies, would be placed in the 0% category,but the securities backed by those mortgages (GNMA securities) would beplaced in the 20% category.Commenters who addressed this issue agreed that GNMA securities shouldbe placed in the 0% risk-weight category because they are backed by thefull faith and credit of the U.S. Government and present virtually no creditrisk to the insurance fund. A few commenters pointed out that loans guaranteedby the VA and FHA, in fact, present more risk to thrifts than GNMA securities.\4\<NOTE/> Many commenters suggested that the Office follow the leadof the banking regulators and place GNMA securities in the 0% risk-weightedcategory and the underlying guaranteed mortgages in the 20% category.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ One commenter stated that VA guaranteed loans pay thelender a maximum of $36,000 or 60% of the original principal amount, whicheveris less. The FHA provides that lenders that do not default will receiveonly 85% of the value of such properties when they are assigned to theDepartment of Housing and Urban Development.The Office is adopting the position taken by the OCC: securities issuedby GNMA are placed in the 0% risk-weighted category, to the extent theyare backed by the full faith and credit of the United States Government,and mortgages guaranteed by the VA and FHA are placed in the 20% category(to the extent they are guaranteed by the FHA or VA). Obligations collaterlizedby securities issued or guaranteed by the U.S. Government or one of itsagencies remain in the 20% risk-weight category.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. High Quality Mortgage-Related Securities</ITAG>The 12/88 proposal defines high quality mortgate-related securities asmortgage-related securities qualifying under section 3(c)(41) of the SecuritiesExchange Act of 1934, commonly referred to as Secondary Mortgage MarketEnhancement Act or ``SMMEA'' securities.\5\<NOTE/> Several commenters raised the concern that the definitionwould not include Federal National Mortgage Association (``FNMA'') andFederal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (``FHLMC'') mortgage-related securities.Other commenters suggested that the Office revise its definition because,as defined in the proposal, the term mortgage-related security would meana security representing an interest in, or one secured by and payable solelyfrom, mortgage assets. Thus, mortgage-backed bonds would be excluded becausethey are backed by, but not solely payable from mortgage assets.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ Briefly, SMMEA securities are securities rated in oneof the two highest rating categories by at least one nationally recognizedstatistical rating organization and either: (1) Represent ownership ofone or more promissory notes which are directly secured by a first lienon a single parcel of real estate and were originated by a savings associationor similar institution supervised and examined by a Federal or state authority;or (2) are secured by one or more promissory notes which by its terms,provide for payments of principal in relation to payments on notes meetingthe requirements in (1), above.The Office has re-examined the definition of high quality mortgage-relatedsecurities in response to these comments and has expanded its definitionto specifically include mortgage-related securities issued by, or fullyguaranteed as to principal and interest by, FNMA and FHLMC and mortgage-backedbonds. It has also concluded that for purposes of a 20% risk-weighting,high-quality mortgage-backed bonds (<T3>i.e.,</T3> mortgage-backed bonds rated in the top two investment graderatings by a nationally recognized rating agency) present no more creditrisk than high-quality mortgage-related securities. Thus, mortgage-backedbonds have been added to the definition of high-quality mortgage-relatedsecurities.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Claims on and Balances Due from Federal Home Loan Banks, FederalReserve Banks and Domestic Depository Institutions</ITAG>Commenters generally suggested that balances due from Federal Home LoanBanks and Federal Reserve Banks should be placed in the 0% risk-weightedcategory. Some commenters viewed deposits in these institutions as cashequivalents. Others expressed the view that a qualitative difference existsbetween deposits in a Federal Home Loan Bank or Federal Reserve Bank anddeposits in a domestic depository institution that calls for a loweringof the risk-weight category for the former.Some commenters suggested that balances due from domestic depository institutionsshould be broken down into two categories: Federally insured deposits andthose that are uninsured. Insured deposits, according to these commenters,should be placed in the 0% category and uninsured deposits in the 20% category.The Office believes that Federal Reserve Bank reserves, balances and stockpresent little or no credit risk. Therefore, deposit reserves and otherbalances at Federal Reserve Banks as well as the book value of paid-inFederal Reserve Bank are placed in the 0% risk-weight category, consistentwith the OCC's final guidelines. Claims on and balances due from FederalHome Loan Banks are placed in the 20% risk-weight category consistent withthe treatment afforded these assets, as direct claims on a United Statesgovernment-sponsored entity, under the OCC final guidelines. The Officehas also decided that the entire amount of balances due from domestic depositoryinstitutions should remain in the 20% risk-weight category not only becausethe OCC places these assets in the 20% category, but also because of thedifficulty of determining the amount of insurance coverage available onsuch deposits prior to an institution's liquidation.<ITAG tagnum="81">4. Stock of Federal Home Loan Banks</ITAG>Many commenters thought that stock in Federal Home Loan Banks should beplaced in the 0% risk-weight category rather than the 20% category becauseit is a required investment for members of the Federal Home Loan Banks.Federal Home Loan Bank stock remains in the 20% risk-weight category. TheOffice, after careful consideration of the comments, is reserving the 0%risk-weight category for assets which are backed by the full faith andcredit of the United States Government and those assets that possess negligiblecredit risk and that have been placed in the 0% category by the OCC inits final guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="81">5. 1-4 Family Residential Mortgages</ITAG>The 12/88 proposal placed permanent 1-4 family residential first mortgageloans with loan-to-value ratios not exceeding 80% at origination in the50% risk-weight category, unless they were backed by qualifying privatemortgage insurance. All other 1-4 family residential loans were assignedto the 100% risk-weight category.This aspect of the proposal drew a number of comments containing suggestionsas to how to analyze risk characteristics of mortgage loans. Overall, commentersexpressed concern that a 50% risk weighting for qualifying mortgages wastoo high, given historical loss experience, especially when compared withother common types of bank and thrift assets, such as commercial and consumerloans. Several commenters, in an effort to address this problem, supporteda system of risk weighting that would measure risk in terms of loan-to-loanvalue ratios, loan seasoning, private mortgage insurance, geographic distribution,fixed versus adjustable rates, and a variety of other factors. Other commenterswere concerned that the higher risk weighting of home loans compared tomortgage-backed securities would cause thrifts to hold securities ratherthan loans, thereby imposing unnecessary transaction costs. One commenterargued that this trend would drive up the cost of agency guarantees and,in turn, lead to higher costs to home buyers.Several commenters provided anecdotal information regarding loss experience,but few provided data regarding the impact of each of these factors onthe relative risk of mortgage loans. A few commenters provided statisticsthat demonstrate a correlation between the incidence of claims on privatemortgage insurance and loan-to-value ratios. One private mortgage insurerstated that virtually all of the $250 million in claims paid out for thecalendar years 1987-88 was made to policy holders with loan-to-value ratiosgreater than 80%.Many commenters suggested that nonqualifying mortgages should be placedin the 50% risk-weight category after two years of timely payments. Statisticspresented by one mortgage insurer, however, indicate that the risk of defaulton a mortgage peaks during the third and fourth year of the loan and remainssignificant into the sixth and seventh years. Other commenters agreed thata two-year seasoning does not significantly reduce the risk of default.Some commenters thought it wise to distinguish between fixed-rate and adjustable-ratemortgages, especially those with ``teaser'' rates. Commenters suggestedthat 1-4 family residential mortgages with fixed rates and loan-to-valueratios of less than 50% presented virtually no risk and many suggestedthat they be placed in risk-weight categories lower than 50% (suggestionsranged from the 20% category to suggested new categories of 25% or 33%).It was suggested that adjustable-rate mortgages present a greater riskof default and, therefore, should be risk-weighted at a higher level (50%category). Mortgages with negative amortization features, some commentersargued, should be placed in the highest risk-weight category assigned toresidential mortgages.The Office received conflicting comments regarding the requirement that1-4 family residential mortgages be insured by private mortgage insurancecompanies to an 80% loan-to-value ratio in order to qualify for a 50% riskweighting. Some commenters expressed strong support for the explicit useof private mortgage insurance as a condition for classifying home loanson the basis that self-insurance does not shift risk away from the federalinsurance fund and hurts small-to-medium-sized thrifts that lack the resourcesto undertake a self-insurance program. Others supported the inclusion ofself-insurance because, in their view, it is more cost effective and providesflexibility to nonstandard home buyers. One commenter suggested that theOffice could require reserves of at least twice an institution's averageannual loss experience to protect the federal deposit insurance fund fromrisks related to self-insurance programs.With respect to the definition of qualifying mortgage loan, the preambleto the 12/88 proposal, stated that private mortgage insurance must be providedby an investment grade issuer approved by the FHLMC and FNMA. The proposedregulatory language did not, however, refer to the need for an investmentgrade rating. One commenter suggested that the Office amend the definitionto include a requirement that issuers be rated by a national rating agency.Another commenter suggested that the Office drop the rating requirementbecause the rating agencies require that an insurer be in business forfive years in some cases. Thus, a rating requirement would create a barrierto entering the private mortgage insurance business.Many commenters asked the Office to clarify the term ``1-4 family residence.''Specifically, commenters sought clarification of the treatment of condominiums,manufactured housing, mobile homes and time-share arrangements.The data submitted by commenters as well as the data available to the stafffrom their research suggest that, relatively, the risk weighting for mortgagesis too high compared with the risk of credit loss from other types of loans.In particular, the credit risks associated with commercial, consumer, andagricultural loans appear substantially greater than the difference impliedby a 50% versus 100% risk weight. It is less clear whether the appropriateresponse is higher weightings for those assets or lower weightings forthe lowest risk of the residential mortgage assets. Competitive equalityand the Basle accord, however, suggest that higher weights for commercial,consumer and agricultural loans by thrifts are not appropriate.As a result, today's risk-based capital regulations retain a 50% risk weightingfor qualifying 1-4 family residential mortgages, which is consistent withthe OCC's final guidelines. The Office, however, will be proposing, ina separate rulemaking action, an optional ``marginal capital'' calculationmethod for 1-4 family mortgages and other residential mortgage-relatedassets designed to address the concerns expressed by commenters. The marginalapproach would require higher capital as loan-to-value ratios rise and,thus, would recognize the direct relationship between loan-to-value ratiosand credit risk. If the marginal capital approach is adopted, it will bean optional method of calculating capital requirements for 1-4 family residentialmortgages.The Office has incorporated the OCC definition of residential propertyto clarify the types of property considered residential for purposes ofinclusion in the 50% risk-weight category. Residential property includeshouses, condominiums, cooperative units, and manufactured homes. Boatsand motor homes are not considered residential property, even if they areused as a primary residence. In addition, the Office has made clear inits definition that time-share properties do not qualify as residentialproperty for this purpose.With respect to the definition of qualifying mortgage loan, the Officehas chosen to retain the 80% loan-to-value ratio requirement. It is theOffice's experience that default rates increase dramatically as loan-to-valueratios rise above the 80% level. This experience was echoed by commenterswho have analyzed mortgage default rates. Given these observations andthe Office's long experience with the thrift industry and residential mortgagelending, the Office is adopting, in addition to the OCC standard of prudentunderwriting, the 80% loan-to-value ratio requirement.In addition, the Office has not chosen to require that issuers of privatemortgage insurance also demonstrate an investment grade rating. Privatemortgage insurers are already required to have FNMA or FHLMC approval.While the Office wants to ensure that mortgage insurance is provided byreliable issuers, it does not wish to create a barrier to entering theprivate mortgage insurance industry. The Office believes that FNMA or FHLMCapproval should generally be adequate in this regard. The Office reservesthe right, however, on a case-by-case basis, to deny ``qualifying treatment''where circumstances merit.The Office has not been presented with sufficient recent market data demonstrating,over a significant period of time, that adjustable rate and negative amortizationmortgages present credit risks so appreciably higher than fixed-rate mortgagesso as to merit placing them in a higher risk category. The data presentedon seasoning as a possible factor in risk weighting mortgages leads theOffice to the conclusion that such seasoning does not adequately lowerthe risk on high loan-to-value residential mortgages. Therefore, the Officeis following the</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">12/88 proposal in both of these areas.<ITAG tagnum="81">6. Home Equity Loans</ITAG>The commenters who addressed the 12/88 proposal to place home equity loansin the 100% category uniformly argued that, if the home equity loan (orsecond mortgage) when combined with the first mortgage, has a loan-to-valueratio of less than 80%, then the loan should fall within the 50% risk-weightcategory. These commenters argued that the risk involved with home equityloans is related to the combined loan-to-value ratio of the first and secondlien, not the fact that the loan represents a second lien. Some commenterstook the position that these loans are, in fact, less risky because institutionshave the opportunity to review the payment history and appraisal comparablesin well-established neighborhoods.The Office addresses this issue in its proposal regarding the marginalcapital option for mortgages. The Office encourges comments on the proposedtreatment of home equity loans under the marginal approach. In the meantime,the Office is leaving home equity loans in the 100% risk-weight category,consistent with OCC final guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="81">7. Multifamily Housing</ITAG>The 12/88 proposal, like those of the federal banking agencies, placedmultifamily housing in the 100% risk-weight category. This proposal drewa great deal of criticism, most of which centered on the need to providemultifamily housing. Many commenters argued that the principal purposeof the thrift charter is to provide affordable housing. These commenterssaid, in support of their arguments, that approximately 40% of the nation'spopulation lives in multifamily housing, and in particular, in buildingswith 5-20 units. One commenter claimed that these 5-20 unit buildings accountfor 55% of all apartment units in the United States and, therefore, theOffice should encourage thrift lending on this type of housing.These commenters also criticized the proposal for placing loans for multifamilyhousing in the same category as commercial, consumer and construction loans.Several commenters urged that apartment loans on such buildings are wellsuited to the underwriting expertise of thrifts in the community and shouldbe placed in a lower risk-weight category. It was suggested by many thathigh-quality multifamily loans should be placed in the 50% risk-weightcategory. Others suggested a 75% risk-weight category for multifamily mortgageloans.High quality multifamily loans were characterized by commenters as firstliens \6\<NOTE/> with loan-to-value ratios of not exceeding 80%. Some commenterswould add to this definition of qualifying multifamily loans one or moreof the following criteria: Balloon payments, if any, should not be payablewithin 7 years of origination; at least one year of seasoning during whichthe loan must have a favorable payment history; stabilized occupancy; afixed interest rate or, if it is a loan with adjustable rate, a debt coverageratio of at least 1.1:1 for the first year and 1.2:1 for the second year.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Or first and subordinate lien if no intervening lienswere in existence.The Office has determined that sufficient evidence exists to demonstratethat certain multifamily housing loans are not as risky as commercial andother standard risk loans. Such housing-related loans are, the Office believes,particularly within the ability of savings associations to evaluate andunderwrite appropriately. In the rule, the Office has defined the ``qualifyingmultifamily housing loans'' to include loans on existing multifamily housingproperties containing 5-36 units with a loan-to-value ratio of 80% or lessand a stabilized occupancy over the preceding year of at least 80%. Theregulation places these qualifying multifamily housing loans in the 50%risk-weight category. All other multifamily housing loans remain in the100% risk-weight category.The Office notes that, while the definition of ``qualifying multifamilymortgage loan'' does not require any specific debt coverage ratio, theOffice will retain the flexibility to deny a lower risk weighting to anymultifamily mortgage loan that it finds, through the supervisory process,to have inadequate debt service coverage.<ITAG tagnum="81">8. Derivative Securities and Mortgage Servicing Rights</ITAG>The 12/88 proposal treated the credit risk of interest-only and principal-onlyportions of mortgage-related securities in the same manner as the underlyingsecurities. Any interest-rate risk inherent in these instruments wouldbe captured by the interest-rate-risk component of the proposed rule. Commentersgenerally agreed with this approach and argued that the same treatmentshould be afforded to mortgage-related securities with residual characteristics,which had been placed in the 100% risk-weight category, regardless of theunderlying collateral.Several commenters pointed out that there are many types of residuals,each having distinctly different reactions to movements in interest rates.Because of these differences, the commenters suggested that it would bearbitrary to treat all residuals in the same manner by placing them inthe 100% credit-risk category regardless of type. Rather, there was substantialsupport for risk weighting residuals according to the credit risk inherentin the security and allowing for the interest-rate-risk component to provideadditional capital based on their interest-rate sensitivity.Commenters also believed that excess and purchased servicing rights shouldbe assigned to the risk-weight category applicable to the underlying collateral.Several commenters expressed the opinion that excess and purchased servicingrights behave like interest-only strip securities because the risk of prepaymentis the predominant risk inherent in servicing rights. That risk, they argued,is adequately covered in the interest-rate-risk component of the 12/88proposal.The Office agrees that the interest-rate-risk component that will be proposedshortly will address most of the risk inherent in residuals as well asinterest- and principal-only portions of mortage-related securities. Untilthe interest-rate-risk component is finalized, however, the Office has,in accordance with the OCC final guidelines, placed these three instrumentsin the 100 percent risk-weight category. In effect, the higher 100 percentrisk weighting reflects both interest-rate and credit risk. After the interest-rate-riskcomponent is promulgated, the credit-risk weights assigned to these assetswill be revisited to more clearly reflect the distinction between creditrisk and interest-rate risk. At that time, the Office anticipates thatthe credit-risk weighting of interest-only, principal-only and residualsecurities will be revised to reflect the credit risk associated with theunderlying collateral. Likewise, the Office has kept excess and purchasedmortgage servicing rights in the 100 percent risk-weight category pendingfurther action on the interest-rate-risk component.Commenters who addressed the FIRREA's effect upon the treatment of purchasedmortgage servicing rights under the risk-based capital rule generally favoredusing book value rather than the 90 percent of fair market value suggestedby FIRREA. The use of book value, commenters argued, would provide a levelplaying field with FDIC-insured banks. Moreover, it would eliminate theproblems involved with establishing acceptable valuation techniques. Severalcommenters asserted that a uniform mechanism for determining a fair marketvalue or purchased mortgage servicing rights on a quarterly basis doesnot currently exist. Thus, until such methods are developed, wide variationsin the calculations are likely to exist, causing additional supervisoryresources to be spent reviewing valuations.Commenters noted that 90 percent of fair market value would, in some cases,exceed book value. While some commenters favored using 90 percent of fairmarket value even if it exceeded book value, others suggested that allowingthis would cause an association to report inflated capital positions, inconsistentwith GAAP.Many commenters asked for clarification that excess mortgage servicingrights are not considered intangible assets and, thus, are not subjectto the limitations placed on purchased mortgage servicing rights.The OCC's final guidelines provide that purchased mortgage servicing must,for capital adequacy purposes, be valued at the lower of either the currentamortized book value or the current market value as established as partof the bank's annual audit. The Office acknowledges the concerns of thosecommenters that stated that there exists no uniform mechanism for valuingpurchased mortage servicing. The cost of purchased mortgage servicing isa relevant indicator of value for these assets that the Office believesshould be considered in setting capital requirements. However, in orderto be consistent with FIRREA and the treatment of servicing under the OCC'sfinal guidelines, the rule values purchased mortgage servicing at the lowerof 90 percent of fair market value to the extent that it is determinable,90 percent of original cost (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the fair market value at the time of purchase) or the currentamortized book value as determined under GAAP, whichever is lower and placessuch rights on the 100 percent risk-weight category.The Office also wishes to clarify that excess mortgage servicing rightsare not considered an intangible asset under GAAP and, thus, are not subjectto the limitations placed on purchased mortgage servicing rights in therule. Accordingly, excess mortgage servicing rights are currently placedin the 100 percent risk weight category, consistent with the OCC's treatment.<ITAG tagnum="81">9. Corporate Debt Securities</ITAG>The 12/88 proposal requested comment regarding the risk weighting of corporatedebt securities that are rated below investment-grade. These securitiesare often referred to as ``junk bonds.'' The 12/88 proposal placed thesesecurities in the 100 percent risk-weight category, but explicitly requestedcomment on whether the securities should be treated in the same manneras equity risk investments, which were placed in the 300 percent risk-weightcategory in the proposal.Commenters had sharply divided views on the riskiness of these securities.Some commenters maintained that a higher risk-weight is needed becausethe market for these securities is less liquid than the market for investmentgrade securities and factors outside the control of the purchaser can causewide swings in the price of the securities. The majority of commenters,however, suggested that the Office keep these securities in the 100 percentrisk-weight category, arguing that they are at least as safe as commercialloans due to the disclosure information that accompanies a high-yield bondoffering, the comparative value of high-yield bonds and commercial loansin the event of default, and the existence of a secondary market for thebonds.Since the publication of the 12/88 proposal, Congress, in section 222 ofFIRREA, has amended the Federal Deposit Insurance Act to require savingsassociations to divest themselves of (or transfer under certain conditions)any corporate debt securities not of investment grade no later than July1, 1994. This requirement will cause most savings associations to accountfor most of their holdings at the lower of cost or market (``LOCOM'') value.Where GAAP requires LOCOM, the calculation of regulatory capital will alsorequire LOCOM treatment for junk bonds. In light of these requirements,the Office will keep these securities in the 100 percent risk-weight category.<ITAG tagnum="81">10. Real Estate Owned</ITAG>All of the comment letters addressing this issue strongly opposed the proposed200 percent risk-weight for real estate owned (``REO''). The major criticismrelated to the existing rules for classifying and valuing REO. Under GAAPand Office rules, REO must be written down to its fair value at the timeit is acquired. It then must be periodically re-valued and carried at thelower of cost or net realizable value. Commenters argued that the periodicmarking to market should be sufficient protection. They characterized the200 percent risk weight as a double reseve penalty that would be unfairlyassessed against the entire industry to protect against the over-valuationpractices of a small group of institutions. These commenters argued thatthe problem would be best handled through increased supervision and enforcementof existing guidelines to prevent the over-valuation of REO and to examinemore closely the need for annual reappraisals.Some commenters asserted that the only legitimate rationale for a 200 percentrisk weight is the concern that the values may decline during the holdingperiod. They argued, however, that this factor is built into the evaluation,using net realizable value analysis, that is mandated when the foreclosedasset is recorded on the balance sheet. They argued that REO, because ofthe explicit write-down, is less risky than a bad loan that has not beenrevalued.Commenters also asserted that REO is the most critically evaluated assetin the thrift portfolio because it appears as the result of foreclosedloan. In addition to undergoing review when the loan was underwritten,the asset is reviewed under GAAP when taken in, then closely tracked, andperiodically revalued. They noted that given the REO's status as a nonperformingasset, the thrift has an incentive to dispose of it as quickly as possibleunder reasonable terms. These incentives ast as further protection to theinsurance fund.Commenters also argued that REO has substantially lower loss experiencethan commercial and land loans, which would be in the standard 100 percentcategory. Many suggested that the REO be given the same risk weight asthe underlying asset before foreclosure. Most commenters, however, requestedthe standard 100 percent risk weighting for repossessed real estate thathas been assigned by the banking regulators.Many comment letters warned that the super-risk weighting of REO mightexacerbate incentives to dispose of it, and might possibly result in wholesale``dumping'' of these assets. This, they argued, would depress local markets,ultimately harming thrifts and the insurance fund.Concern was also expressed regarding the treatment of delinquencies. Itwas argued that the proposal would give thrifts a strong incentive to avoidtaking over a property if higher capital were required of REO than delinquentloans, especially where it would be appropriate course of action.Supervisory experience indicates that portfolios of GAAP insolvent thriftstend to have a high relative proportion of REO. Data demonstrates thatREO is much riskier than standard loans and may be overvalued on many thrift'sbooks. While REO is acquired at fair value, from that point on it is carriedat the lower of that value or net realizable value. However, such assetsare eventually sold at market value, which is generally lower. The REOhas thus, because of accounting conventions, been carried at an artificiallyhigh value. In addition, REO can be viewed as an equity investment by thesavings association, which the Office believes necessitates a higher capitalcharge. The Office has, therefore, chosen to keep REO in the 200 percentrisk-weight category.The Office agrees that it should minimize disincentives for thrifts toforeclose on property. Today's rule places all loans 90 days or more pastdue in the 200 percent risk-weight category, except for 1-4 family residentialmortgages which are in the 100 percent risk-weight category. In effect,once a loan is delinquent, its risk weighting doubles to reflect the increasedrisk of loss to the savings association. Therefore, standard-risk loansassigned to the 100 percent risk-weight category would, once delinquent,be assigned to the 200 percent category; qualifying mortgage loans assignedto the 50 percent category would, by definition, no longer qualify forthe lower risk weighting once delinquent and would be assigned to the 100percent category.<ITAG tagnum="81">11. Equity Investments</ITAG>The 12/88 proposal provided for the creation of a 300 percent risk-weightcategory to contain ``net equity-risk investment.'' This included all investmentsdefined as equity-risk investments (``ERI'') pursuant to 12 CFR 563.9-8(<T3>i.e.</T3>, investments in equity securities, service corporations,operating subsidiaries, and real estate, as well as certain high-ratioland loans and nonresidential construction loans.) In addition, the proposeddefinition included as net ERI any direct credit substitutes by a savingsassociation of the obligations of its subsidiaries or service corporations,plus any ownership interests in an investment company that has any assetsin its portfolio that would qualify as ERI if held by the savings association.A few comments unequivocally supported the proposal as presented, or supportedapplication of the alternative, dollar-for-dollar exclusion method. Virtuallyall of the respondents, however, took issue with some aspect of the ERIproposal. The major concern expressed in the comments was that the capitalregulations should distinguish among risks associated with different typesof ERI. The need to differentiate was asserted to be especially acute,given the unusually high risk category. Moreover, it was argued, the specialrisk presented by thrift investments in ERI is already adequately addressedby the existing ERI regulation; any inadequacy would be better addressedthrough amendments to that rule, rather than by ``penalizing'' such investmentsthrough the capital regulation.In addition, commenters also claimed that the failure to ``grandfather''existing ERI could heavily penalize an institution's profitability eventhough that thrift has been conducting those investments in a safe andprofitable manner. Some thrifts suggested exemptions from the 300 percentrisk weighting for such existing portfolios generally, or, alternativesly,where a successful track record can be shown. Commenters argued that failureto have some type of grandfathering would disrupt the economic substanceof existing transactions.The evidence submitted in support of differentiating the risks of ERI wasanecdotal, asserting that particular equity-risk investment activitieshad been conducted profitably and with minimal losses. Some commenterscited the Bank Board's February 10, 1989 report to Congress, assertingthat direct investments have not been responsible for more than a fractionof the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation (``FSLIC'') resolutioncosts. Commenters gave particular attention to thrifts' real estate financingthrough loans and equiity participations in partnerships and service corporationsand identified a number of other specific types of ERI for exemption fromthe 300 percent risk-weight category, asserting that they have a provenrecord of profitable investment without more than the standard credit risk.These include investiments in data processing companies, credit card receivableservice bureaus, insurance brokers, discount securities brokers, and propertymanagement companies.Many commenters suggested that an investment in any company that is doingan activity that would be directly permissible for the thrift (<T3>e.g.</T3>, mortgage origination or holding REO) should be affordeda pass-through treatment (<T3>i.e.</T3>, treated as if the parent were doing the activity directly).This treatment was also suggested for out-of-state activities that mustbe done through subsidiaries, although they would be permissible in-statefor the thrift directly. If the subsidiary engages in more than one enterprise,then commenters suggested pass-through treatment on a pro-rata basis. Insupport of this proposal, commenters asserted that indirect investmentsin lines of business that the thrift can do directly have no greater riskassociated with them when conducted through a subsidiary or partnership.Indeed, it was argued that the corporate separation may in fact reducethe risk to the thrift and the insurance fund.Some commenters also suggested that certain kinds of equity securitiescould be exempted from the 300 percent category and given a lower weighting.In particular, equity securities of FNMA and FHLMC, were cited as highyield, but lower risk securities. Commenters also requested lower riskweighting for mandatorily redeemable preferred stock. Although these instrumentstechnically are equity securities, commenters asserted that both GAAP andthe capital markets are said to treat them as debt issuances which havethe same risk as corporate bonds and commercial loans, since they enjoypriority over common stockholders both in liquidation and periodic returnsthrough their sinking fund. Commenters also suggested exempting collateralizedpreferred stock from this category. They argued that such stock is lessrisky than ordinary equity securities since it is collateralized by unencumberedmortgages or mortgage-backed securities in an amount at least equal tothe liquidation preference of the preferred stockholders.In FIRREA, Congress has specifically limited the ability of state-charteredsavings associations to make equity investments in an amount or of a typenot permitted for Federal savings associations. The FIRREA also requiredthe divestiture of most equity investments as quickly as prudently possible,but not later than July 1, 1994. See FIRREA, section 222, adding a newsection 28(c) to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act. The Office has carefullyconsidered this issue and has determined that, in light of this clear Congressionalconcern with the potential riskiness of such investments as evidenced bythe required eventual divestiture of many equity investments, it is appropriateto treat equity investments in a similar manner to the treatment of investmentsin subsidiaries that engage in activities as a principal that are not permissiblefor a national bank, <T3>i.e.</T3>, to phase out such investments from capital calculationsover a five-year period. During this transitional period, today's ruleplaces those equity investments includable in assets (and, thus, in capital)in the 100 percent risk-weight category.This approach will help to ensure that the thrift maintains adequate capitalagainst its equity investments and, until such investments are divested,it will encourage early divestiture. Additionally, it will ensure adequatecapital for those equity-type investments that do not fall within the FDIC'sdefinition of ``equity investment'' and therefore may still be permissibleinvestments for savings associations.<ITAG tagnum="81">12. Consolidation</ITAG>The 12/88 proposal stated that, for purposes of determining the asset basefor applying the new capital rule, the Office would require thrifts touse the consolidation method as required by GAAP to report investmentsin subsidiaries and service corporations and the assets and liabilitiesof such companies. The consolidation method is consistent with the bankingregulators' requirement that banks generally consolidate the assets andliabilities of a bank and its majority-owned subsidiaries to calculatecapital requirements.In connection with the proposed consolidation requirement, the 12/88 proposaldiscussed an alternative ``exclusion method'' for thrift investments inequity risk investments, including investments in service corporationsand operating subsidiaries. This exclusion method was proposed for considerationas an alternative to the 300 percent risk-weighting of ERI. Under the exclusionmethod, an institution's investment in subsidiaries (including loans andadvances to subsidiaries) is not counted in the thrift's risk-weightedasset base and, thus, is effectively ``added'' to the capital requirementof the institution. This method in effect would require thrifts to providecapital for their investment in subsidiaries on a dollar-for-dollar basiswith their own capital rather than leveraging that investment with insureddeposits. 53 FR 51808.Various commenters opposed the use of the exclusion method for equity-riskinvestments since it amounts to a dollar-for-dollar capital requirementfor permissible investments. Commenters also sought clarification abouthow the proposed consolidation requirement would be implemented. Some commenterswere concerned that consolidation might be implemented in a way that wouldresult in double counting of the consolidated assets of the subsidiaryand the parent thrift's investment in the subsidiary.FIRREA provides that the assets and liabilities of subsidiaries engagedin activities that are not impermissible for national banks must be consolidatedwith those of the parent savings association for purposes of determiningthe parent thrift's compliance with its capital standards. Section 5(t)(5)(E).A savings association's investments in or extensions of credit to a subsidiaryengaged in activities as principal that are not permissible for nationalbanks must be deducted from the association's assets for purposes of determiningcompliance with the capital standards required under section 5(t)(1). Section5(t)(5)(E). If the subsidiaries were engaged in impermissible activitiesas of April 12, 1989, however, FIRREA provides schedule for phasing-outthe inclusion of such investments over a five-year period. During thistransitional period, today's rule requires associations to consolidateon a prorated basis (after accounting for the deduction of investment thathas occurred) the assets of such subsidiaries. The consolidation requirement stated in the 12/88 proposal would applyto special purpose finance subsidiaries as well as service corporationand other operating subsidiaries. As part of this proposal, the Board feltthat it could delete, as unnecessary, andSection; 563.13-2 which separatelytreats finance subsidiary issuances for purposes of the current liability-basedcapital regulations. Under current andSection; 563.13-2, the amount of securitiesissued through a finance subsidiary is exempted from the capital regulation'sliability base if it substantially duration-matched; i.e., the issued securitiesare collateralized by assets that have substantially the same durationas the securities issued, or the securities were remitted in exchange fora liability issued by the parent thrift which was otherwise includablein the parent's regulatory capital liability base. Under the proposed consolidationrequirement of the new risk-based capital rule, the relatively low creditrisk of finance subsidiary assets would be accounted through direct applicationof the risk weighting to these assets, with any maturity mismatch beingcovered by the interest-rate risk component. See 53 FR at 51804.Several commenters took specific exception to the possibility of includingfinance subsidiaries in the proposed new consolidation requirement. Theyargued that consolidation of finance subsidiary which issued collateralizedmortgage obligations (``CMOs'') or real estate mortgage investment conduits(``REMICs'') makes little economic sense given the essentially non-recoursefinancing. They contended that sale-of-assets treatment should carry overto the consolidation requirement. Commenters found application of risk-weighting,through consolidation, to the assets of finance subsidiaries troublesomesince the Board had encouraged use of these special purpose financing vehiclesthrough the special rules and exclusions (<T3>e.g.</T3>, they are currently excluded from the calculation of requiredregulatory capital). Commenters noted that there is virtually no interest-raterisk, given the duration matching, and very little credit risk, given thehighly rated assets. Thus, many commenters requested that any finance subsidiariesutilized prior to the new capital rule be grandfathered, with no capitalbeing required against such existing assets. Section 5(t)(5) does not establisha separate treatment for finance subsidiaries. Therefore, the Office isremoving the separate treatment for such subsidiaries located in 12 CFR563.13-2 (c) and (d) (1988). Investments in these subsidiaries will betreated for regulatory capital purposes in the same manner as investmentsin other subsidiaries. Because the rule risk weights the assets of thefinance subsidiary, the separate treatment of such subsidiaries is madeunnecessary. Although the 12/88 proposal would have removed this sectionentirely, the Office has determined that only the paragraphs which affectedthe computation of regulatory capital should be removed.<ITAG tagnum="81">13. Off-Balance Sheet Items</ITAG>a. <T3>Asset sales with recourse; senior/subordinated structures. </T3>Themajority of comments addressing this point opposed the 12/88 proposal'streatment of asset sales with recourse and the subordinated portions ofsenior/subordinated securities. The 12/88 proposal treated an asset salewith recourse, if not already included on the balance sheet, as an off-balancesheet risk financing, rather than a sale of assets. In other words, capitalwould be required against the full amount sold, even if the buyer had recourseagainst the savings association for less than the full amount. Retentionof the subordinated portion of a senior/subordinated loan structure orsecurities was treated in the same manner, <T3>i.e., </T3>capital was required against both the senior and subordinatedportions.Commenters argued that the proposed treatment of these instruments woulddestroy the secondary market for mortgages, which they characterized ascurrently providing much-needed liquidity for thrifts and keeping coststo the consumer down. Many commenters viewed the proposed treatment ofthese assets as unduly harsh. Some suggested that the Office consider placingthe subordinated portions of senior/subordinated structures in a higherrisk-weight category to account for the increased incidence of risk inherentin subordinated pieces rather than requiring both the originating thriftand thrifts purchasing senior pieces to hold capital against the same assets.Many commenters argued for treatment consistent with the banking agencies,especially where assets are sold with recourse to GNMA, FNMA and FHLMC.The banking regulators, by referring to the call report instructions fornational banks regarding the treatment of these assets, appear to exemptmortgages sold to these agencies from the capital requirements regardingasset sales with recourse.\7\<NOTE/> Commenters contended that the 12/88 proposal would, if madeeffective, create a competitive disadvantage that would be detrimentalto the continued viability of thrifts. They argued that the proposal wouldseriously impede institutions that cannot originate adjustable-rate mortgagesfrom purchasing them on the secondary market, resulting in weakened institutionsand a greater threat to the health of the insurance fund. At a minimum,commenters favored the grandfathering of all outstanding senior/subordinatedstructures and asset sales where recourse exists.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The staff of the OCC has informed this Office, however,that this was not the intent of the regulation and that it does not intendto exempt such mortgages sold with recourse from its capital rule.The Office has given careful consideration to the issues raised by commentersand has attempted to address a number of these concerns in the marginalcapital proposal that it will shortly be publishing. For purposes of thisrule, however, the Office is adopting its proposed position because itbelieves that it more accurately recognizes the significant risks in thisarea than the alternatives suggested by commenters. The Office notes thatbanking regulators are moving toward the Office's position in proposedmodifications to the call reports prepared by national banks and, thus,may alleviate the potential competitive disadvantages between thrifts andbanks. The Office wishes to clarify that, for purposes of this regulation,asset sales with only standard representations and warranties will notbe considered sales with recourse. In instances where a savings associationswaps with recourse mortgage loans in exchange for a FHLMC or FNMA participationcertificate (``PC''), the mortgage loans are to be converted and risk weightedin accordance with this regulation; the on-balance sheet PC is not requiredto be capitalized. Subordinated portions of senior/subordinated securitieswill be treated similarly.b. <T3>Commitments. </T3>The 12/88 proposal would assign a 0% conversion factorto unused commitments that are unconditionally cancelable and that theinstitution will review before extending. All other commitments would beassigned to a 50 percent conversion factor. Many commenters preferred theassignment made by the banking regulators in their final guidelines whichassigned all commitments with a maturity of less than one year to the 0percent conversion factor. Several others asked that the Office exemptmortgage commitments from this capital requirement, particularly becausethe life of such commitments is short and, in the opinion of these commenters,the requirement would result in increased costs to the consumer.Many commenters believed that commitments to sell loans should offset commitmentsto make loans. Several commenters expressed the view that loans in processand undisbursed portions of construction loans should not be included inthe capital calculation.A few commenters asked the Office to clarify that the term ``unconditionallycancelable'' refers to an institution's ability to cancel a commitmentunconditionally if it retains its rights to the full extent permitted underFederal law. Such a clarification would ensure that state law impedimentsto cancellation would not cause a commitment automatically be assignedto a 50 percent conversion factor.In today's rule, the Office's treatment of commitments is consistent withthe banking regulators' treatment. Therefore, unused commitments with anoriginal maturity of one year or less have a 0 percent credit conversionfactor. Unused commitments with an original maturity of greater than oneyear are also assigned a 0 percent credit conversion factor, if they areunconditionally cancelable and the savings association has the contractualright to make, and does make, a separate credit decision based upon theborrower's current financial condition before each drawdown. Unused portionsof retail credit card lines that are unconditionally cancelable by thesavings association in accordance with applicable law are also in the 0percent credit conversion category, as are unused portions of home equitylines of credit that are unconditionally cancelable in accordance withfederal law. A 50 percent credit conversion factor is assigned to unusedportions of commitments, including home equity lines of credit, with anoriginal maturity exceeding one year.c. <T3>Interest-rate contracts. </T3>Under the 12/88 proposal, the credit-equivalentamount of interest-rate contracts was the current exposure, or replacementcost of the contract as determined by its current market value at the endof the reporting quarter. The credit-equivalent amount is assigned to the20 percent or 50 percent risk-weight category, depending on the natureof the obligor.Several commenters thought that this provision was duplicative of the interest-rate-riskcomponent. One commenter was concerned that the interest-rate-risk componentwould encourage the use of interest-rate contracts to manage risk but therisk weighting of off-balance sheet interest rate contracts would discouragethe use of this tool for risk management. Another commenter suggested thatthe interest-rate-risk component should make it clear that assets thatare fully hedged by an interest-rate swap transaction should be excludedfrom the calculation of a savings association's value of portfolio equity.One commenter thought that the proposed treatment of interest rate contractswas too broad. This commenter stated that, under most circumstances, thecounterparty to an interest rate swap will post collateral in the formof a bond or is a counterparty of investment-grade quality. Given thesecircumstances, the commenter argued that there is no risk to the savingsassociation or to the federal insurance fund.Several commenters discussed the netting aspect of the proposal. One commentersuggested that, where a savings association has more than one contractwith the same counterparty and some have mark-to-market gains and othersmark-to-market losses, the contracts should be netted and the resultingamount used as the base for the capital calculation. Another commentersuggested that the rule should allow for netting positive and negativereplacement costs of contracts.The Office, in today's regulation, has continued to treat interest-ratecontracts and exchange-rate contracts in the same manner as the OCC.B. Interest-Rate RiskThe 12/88 proposal contained an interest-rate risk component designed totake into account, for capital calculation purposes, the effect that achange in interest rates would have on the value of the thrift's portfolio.The interest-rate risk component was the subject of a separate advancesupplemental notice of proposed rulemaking published on June 22, 1989.The Office has received a number of comments regarding interest-rate riskin response to the 12/88 proposal as well as the advance notice. It believesthat interest-rate risk is far too important a risk in most savings association'sportfolios to ignore until the banking agencies reach a consensus on thisissue. The Office is therefore preparing a notice of proposed rulemakingon the interest-rate risk component. That rulemaking will discuss and respondto all the comments it has received on the issue. Thus, discussion of commentsrelated to interest-rate risk are not included in this rulemaking.C. Collateralized BorrowingsThe 12/88 proposal contained a collateralized borrowing component thatrequired capital for liabilities against which the savings associationhas pledged specific assets, pledged to maintain a specific value of assets,or for which the structure of a transaction could otherwise result in aneffective pledging of assets. The proposal contained a 3 percent capitalrequirement for such liabilities.Commenters uniformly expressed the opinion that: (1) Collateralized borrowingsdo not increase the risk exposure of the federal deposit insurance fund;(2) the proposal would result in double-counting; (3) the proposal wouldput thrifts at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis banks; and (4) a liability-basedcapital requirement has no place in a regulation that measures the riskinessof assets to determine capital requirements.After careful consideration of the comments on this issue, the Office hasdetermined that the problems presented by collateralized borrowings aremore appropriately addressed in conjunction with issues related to insurancepremium assessments. The Office notes that Congress has specifically instructedthe Secretary of the Treasury to study the issue and determine whethercollateralized borrowings should be added to the deposit insurance baseas part of its overall study of the deposit insurance system. FIRREA, section1001(b)(4). The collateralized borrowings portion of the proposed risk-basedcapital rule does not, therefore, appear in today's rule. D. Core capital Several comments addressed issues relating to the components of capitalgenerally. Some of these comments involved some form of grandfatheringfor those components of regulatory capital that are no longer componentsof risk-based capital standards. It was suggested that the Office followthe OCC in permitting certain elements of Tier 2 capital in Tier 1 through1992. Another commenter requested that infusions of non-cash assets, suchas real estate, that were approved as capital before FIRREA's enactmentin connection with supervisory acquisitions should be grandfathered ascapital. Several comments were received asking that FSLIC-preferred stockand income capital certificates (``ICCs'') be placed in core capital. This Office is strongly committed to ensuring that solid capital protectionis provided by its capital requirements. Because supplementary capitalelements provide less protection than is expected of core capital, thisOffice declines to follow the OCC with regard to allowing certain elementsof supplementary capital to satisfy core capital requirements during thetransition period.With respect to the inclusion of contributed assets in core capital, theFIRREA Conference Report makes clear that the Director has discretion asto whether such assets may be treated as capital to the extent previouslyauthorized, ``if such treatment would be no less stringent than the treatmentOCC provides for national banks.'' H.R. Rpt. 101-222 at 405. Like the OCC,this Office will examine such requests on a case-by-case basis.The rule includes FSLIC preferred stock and ICCs in supplementary capital,rather than core capital, because of the small degree of protection theyprovide. For this reason, this Office declines to place such items in corecapital, but has placed them, along with mutual capital certificates andnet worth certificates, in supplementary capital.Finally, one commenter suggested that this Office permit both noncumulativeand cumulative perpetual preferred stock in core capital. This Office,for reasons discussed below, will follow the OCC by permitting only noncumulativeperpetual preferred stock in core capital and assigning cumulative perpetualpreferred stock to supplementary capital. This Office, in accordance with its mandate under FIRREA, has classifiedthe following elements as core capital (less deductions from core capitalset forth in andSection; 567.5(a)(2)): Common stockholder's equity (includingretained earnings); noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and relatedsurplus (as conditioned in footnote one of andSection; 567.5); minority interestin the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries; and nonwithdrawableaccounts and pledged deposits that meet the conditions of andSection; 567.5(a)(1)(iv). E. Maturing Capital Instruments Several commenters supported the proposed approach of limiting to a fixedpercentage (10-20 percent) of total capital (including maturing capitalinstruments) the amount of maturing capital instruments includable as supplementarycapital for each of seven years remaining to maturity. Others supportedthe alternative set forth in Appendix A of the 12/88 proposal (``AppendixA'') that established a schedule of amortization tied to the amount ofthe particular institution's level of tangible capital. 53 FR at 51813,51817. A third group argued for retaining the existing provisions withoutsubstantive amendment, at least for currently outstanding issuances ofmature capital instruments.Under existing capital regulations, the portion of qualifying subordinateddebt that may count as capital is reduced by one-seventh over each of itsseven years to maturity. Supporters of the proposed percentage limitationmethod generally applauded the elimination of this amortization rule. Theyviewed the existing rule as unnecessarily arbitrary, claiming that themarket for these instruments has now grown to the point where there issubstantially less risk that refunding would be a problem.Some commenters argued that the percentage limitation on maturing capitalincludable as supplementary capital should be raised to 20% (or higher).In addition to the industry need for flexibility in raising capital, thesecommenters argued that in the event of a thrift's liquidation, the maturingcapital instruments, regardless of remaining maturity, give the insurancefund the same protection as common stock and retained earnings.Some comment letters favored the alternative method set forth in appendixA of tying inclusion of maturing capital instruments to tangible capital.Several commenters felt that regardless of which percentage the Officeselected in the percentage limitation proposal, the formula could easilyproduce abrupt, sizable shifts in the amount of a savings association'smaturing capital instruments that qualify as capital. They preferred theappendix A's predictable and regular annual decreases as the instrumentapproaches maturity.Other reasons offered by commenters for favoring the appendix A methodincluded the desire to avoid the transaction costs of refinancing instrumentsafter they have less than seven years remaining to maturity. They assertedthat it also gives more flexibility to thrifts to finance their operationswith shorter maturity instruments, which generally are less expensive.Furthermore, in the view of some commenters, the proposed percentage formulamight disadvantage smaller thrifts whose dollar amount in total regulatorycapital would be relatively low even if their percentage of capital toassets exceeds required minimums.A number of commenters supported retention of the existing amortizationschedule. Although some hoped for continuation of this schedule for futureissuances, these commenters argued strongly for the grandfathering underthe existing schedule of maturing capital instruments that had alreadybeen issued. They argued that the existing subordinated debt structureof thrifts was planned according to the current amortization rule, includinglong range plans for replacing those funds with equity capital. These commenterswarned that the unexpected disruption could further damage thrifts' generalaccess to this segment of the capital markets.Some commenters argued that the Office should offer thrifts a choice, withregard to existing maturing capital, between the existing amortizationmethod and the method finally adopted.Commenters urged that any ``grandfather'' provision should include allmaturing capital instruments that either were issued, or for which an applicationhad been filed under the existing regulations, as of December 23, 1988,the date of publication of the risk-based capital proposal. For these issuances,commenters urged, the savings association should be able to elect seven-yearamortization treatment under the existing regulation. They claimed thatinclusion of filed applications, as well as outstanding issuances, wouldavoid the expense of having to renegotiate and restructure these pendingissuances.After consideration of the comments received on this issue, the Officehas determined that it will treat subordinated debt issuances that werein existence as of the date of promulgation of this risk-based capitalrule under the provisions that were in effect as of November 6, 1989. Thus,for any existing subordinated debt, institutions may continue to use theseven-year amortization. For any future issuances of subordinated debtor any other maturing capital instrument, the Office is allowing savingsassociations to choose, when the application to issue the debt is made,between the treatment contained in its 12/88 proposal and the treatmentadopted by the OCC in its final risk-based capital guidelines, subjectto the requirement that all maturing capital instruments outstanding atany point in time must be treated the same way and such treatment documented.Under the first option, based on the proposal, the allowable percentageof maturing capital that a savings association could include as a componentof supplementary capital that matured in any given year would be limitedto 20% of the savings association's capital. The alternative that mirrorsthe OCC rule provides that, at the beginning of each of the last five yearsof the life of subordinated debt, the amount eligible to be included assupplementary capital is reduced by 20% of the original amount of the subordinateddebt. The decision as to which treatment an issuance will receive mustbe made by the issuing savings association at the time of the applicationand is irrevocable as to that issuance.All outstanding maturing capital instruments at any given point in time,except for those grandfathered under the current rule, must be treatedfor capital calculation purposes entirely under either the OCC treatmentor the Office's treatment. Thus, if a savings association wishes to issuenew maturing capital instruments using the OCC option while it has an outstandingissuance that is subject to the Office's treatment, it may not do so. Onlywhen the entire first issuance matures may the association change its optionwith respect to the second issuance. This is because the two alternativesfocus on different aspects of these instruments, <T3>i.e.</T3>, the OCC treatment looks at each individual maturing capitalissuance while the OTS treatment looks at all outstanding maturing capitalinstruments.F. General Valuation Loan and Lease Loss AllowancesAs proposed, the inclusion of general loss allowances as supplementarycapital would be limited to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets, the limitationimposed by the banking regulators as of December 31, 1992.Some commenters took exception to the 1.25% limitation. They argued thatthese reserves are available to absorb future losses and should be includedas supplementary capital without limitation. Several commenters requestedthat all specific loan loss allowances, not just general reserves, be countedtoward capital up to the percentage limit.On the other hand, some commenters supported the proposed limit, if notan even more stringent limitation. Under GAAP, loan loss allowances areestablished against estimable and probable losses. Thus, thrifts are likelyto call upon these when actual losses occur.The OCC permits inclusion of the allowance for loan and lease losses upto a maximum of 1.5% of risk-weighted assets for the period from December31, 1990 until December 30, 1992. This allowance is equivalent to the Office'sgeneral loan loss allowance. Therefore, the Office will permit the useof general loss allowances up to a maximum of 1.50% of risk-weighted assetsuntil December 30, 1992 and 1.25% of risk-weighted assets thereafter. Anygeneral loss allowances that are not included in assets are deducted fromtotal risk-weighted assets. Because savings associations do not have generalvaluation allowances in the amounts that banks have, and have not reliedon them as part of capital to the same extent, the Office is placing the1.5% limitation in effect immediately, rather than delaying it until December1990.G. Revaluation ReservesThe 12/88 proposal also requested comment as to whether revaluation reserves(<T3>i.e.,</T3> the unrealized appreciation in fixed assets and long-termequity investments) should be includable as supplementary capital. Becausethe OCC does not include revaluation reserves (or an equivalent) in supplementarycapital and such treatment would be inconsistent with generally acceptedaccounting principles, the Office declines to include revaluation reservesin the components of capital.H. GoodwillThe 12/88 proposal placed all goodwill in the 200% risk-weight category.Most commenters took issue with this proposed treatment. The strongestopposition came from a number of institutions that participated in supervisorymergers during the early 1980s. Commenters that were not involved in supervisorymergers opposed the treatment of goodwill as an asset and effectively ascapital, arguing that to allow such laxity in the capital requirementswould subvert the proposal's purpose of creating a stronger and more prudentcapital structure for the industry.Congress has addressed the issue of goodwill in great detail in FIRREA.New Section 18(n) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, added by section221 of FIRREA, provides that no Federal banking agency is to allow anydepository institution to include any unidentifiable intangible asset (<T3>i.e.,</T3> goodwill) acquired after April 12, 1989 in calculation ofcapital except as permitted under section 5(t). In general, the Officeis required to follow the lead of the OCC, which deducts goodwill fromcapital except for pre-1985 goodwill which is grandfathered. FIRREA, however,provides for a 5-year phase-out and a maximum 20 year straight-line amortizationof qualifying supervisory goodwill as a component of core capital. Underthe terms of FIRREA, the phase-out can only be utilized by ``eligible''savings associations, <T3>i.e.,</T3> those that are well-managed, in compliance with all applicablestatutes, regulations, orders and supervisory agreements, and not involvedin transactions that threaten the safety and soundness of the savings association.See section 5(t)(3)(B).The definition of supervisory goodwill was the subject of some concernamong commenters. The Act did not define the term supervisory goodwill,however, there was a great deal of congressional discussion of what constitutessupervisory goodwill for purposes of the statutory transition rule. Unfortunately,there is conflicting legislative history in this area. The majority ofcommenters addressing this issue urged the Office to adopt the definitionused in the House Banking Committee Report 8<NOTE/> which, they argue, was fashioned to assure a reasonable transitionfor all institutions with supervisory goodwill approved by the Bank Board.Many commenters argued for an even broader definition that would includegoodwill that resulted from a merger or acquisition of ``problem'' institutions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>8 The House Report defines supervisory goodwill as that goodwill``resulting from the acquisition, merger, consolidation, purchase of assetsor other business combination of any savings association where the marketvalue of the assets acquired was less than the market value of the liabilitiesat the time of the transaction and where the accounting treatment of thegoodwill has been approved by the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.'' H.R.Rpt. 101-54, Part I at 432.Some commenters suggested that savings associations be deemed eligibleunless or until the Director makes a determination that the associationdoes not meet the eligibility requirements. The main concern expressedby commenters was that savings associations and supervision staff wouldbe pressed to submit and review applications for eligibility and businessplans required under section 5(t)(6)(A) of FIRREA in such a short time-frame.In addition, a few commenters requested that the Office allow the nettingof goodwill and discounts as reported in the Thrift Financial Report. Clarificationwas also sought regarding the inclusion of supervisory goodwill in thecalculation of tangible capital.In today's regulation, the Office is defining supervisory goodwill to includenot only institutions that failed their capital requirements but also institutionsthat presented supervisory concerns. The Office defines eligible savingsassociations in accordance with FIRREA and is including a provision deemingsavings associations with supervisory goodwill to be eligible savings associationsuntil notified otherwise by the Director. The Office believes this treatmentis consistent with congressional intent while this asset is being phasedout of capital.The Office has not provided for the netting of goodwill and discounts inthe rule because to do so would neither comply with GAAP nor OCC standards.Under the provisions of FIRREA, the Office cannot include supervisory goodwillin the calculation of tangible capital.While FIRREA arguably provides the Office with the flexibility to grandfathercertain goodwill as a component of supplementary capital, and such grandfatheringwould be consistent with the current OCC rules, the Office believes thatsuch a position would not conform with congressional intent. The Office'sregulation, therefore, requires the deduction of non-supervisory goodwilland the phase-out over 5 years of qualifying supervisory goodwill. Thus,non-qualifying goodwill will be deducted immediately upon the effectivedate of the regulation and qualifying supervisory goodwill will be phased-outover the five-year statutory schedule.I. Leverage RatioThe 12/88 proposal contained a 2% leverage ratio designed to protect institutionswith relatively riskless assets from losses that could occur due to mismanagementor fraud. The OCC's final risk-based guidelines did not contain a similarleverage limit \9\<NOTE/> FIRREA provides that the Office adopt a leverage limit ofnot less than 3 percent. The Act also, as mentioned previously, requiresthe Office to adopt capital standards that are no less stringent than thoseapplicable to national banks. The OCC has a required capital ratio of 5.5%of primary capital and 6% of total capital under its current capital rule.The issue of what the leverage ratio for savings associations should beafter the enactment of FIRREA has been the subject of much comment.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ The OCC has proposed to adopt a 3% leverage ratio effectivewhen the risk-based capital rule takes effect. 54 FR 46394 (Nov. 3, 1989).The overwhelming majority of comments the Office has received supportedthe adoption of a 3% leverage ratio. Commenters argued that the legislativehistory of FIRREA supports their position. They argued that because thecurrent OCC ratio refers to primary capital rather than core capital (whichconsists of fewer elements that provide better protection to the insurancefund) it does not make sense to require such a high ratio to the risk-basedcapital framework. In fact, they argue, to do so would be to defeat theaim of a risk-based approach: To lower capital requirements by loweringthe risk in the association's asset portfolio.The Office has concluded that the 3% leverage ratio prescribed by FIRREAshould be promulgated effective at the same time as the risk-based capitalrequirement. It is difficult to draw a comparison between the OCC's currentprimary and total capital leverage ratios and the core capital leverageratio prescribed by FIRREA because the components of primary and of totalcapital differ significantly from the components of core capital. <T3>Compare </T3>12 CFR 3.2(c) (definition of primary capital) <T3>with </T3>54 FR at 4179 (OCC definition of Tier 1, or core, capital).The Office concludes, however, that its own definition of core capital,which emulates the OCC's, is more stringent for savings associations thanthe OCC's definition of primary capital is for national banks. For example,national banks may include allowances for loan and lease losses in primarycapital. These allowances are not permissible as core capital either forbanks or for savings associations.Moreover, the application of the primary and total capital ratios wouldactually result in a rule that is inconsistent with the overall patternof the capital provisions of the statute. Embedded in section 5(t) of theHOLA is a clear pattern that calls for savings associations to steadilyincrease capital over the next 5 years. Thus, for example, capital mustincrease as supervisory goodwill phases out and as the exclusion rule applicableto investments in certain subsidiaries phases in. Empirical data show,however, that the application to thrifts of the primary and total capitalratios currently in effect for national banks would cause more savingsassociations to fail their capital requirement than will fail under a 3%core capital leverage limit. Thus, imposition of the primary and totalcapital ratios would cause capital requirements to ``spike'' up immediatelyupon the rule's effective date, and then recede if and when the Comptrolleradopts a 3% leverage ratio. This result would be inconsistent with theapparent statutory scheme of a gradual, but continually increasing, capitalrequirement.The FIRREA requires savings associations to comply with a core capitalleverage ratio no less stringent than that applicable to national banks.Since such a limit is not yet applicable to national banks, as discussedabove, savings associations need not yet comply with this future standard.The FIRREA, however, as discussed, specifies a minimum 3% core capitalleverage ratio in the absence of such a currently applicable OCC standard.The Office believes it is appropriate to adopt a 3% leverage limit in tandemwith its risk-based capital standard. The Comptroller has reasoned thatthis leverage limit is appropriate, when applied in combination with arisk-based standard, because, while the leverage limit provides protectionagainst certain risks not addressed by the risk-based rule, ``the risk-basedstandard should be the primary focus in determining the adequacy of a bank'scapital.'' 54 FR at 4170. The Office believes it is consistent with thesafe and sound operation of savings associations to require applicationof the two rules together.J. Phase-inThe 12/88 proposal provided that savings associations must hold 2% of totalassets in the form of core equity capital and 80% of their risk-based capitalrequirement by January 1, 1991. Fully phased-in risk-based capital wouldhave been required by January 1, 1993 under the proposal. A number of commentersconsidered this phase-in schedule too optimistic and, indeed, unrealisticgiven current capital markets and the negative publicity regarding savingsand loans. A variety of time tables were suggested ranging from an additionaltwo to ten years to provide for a smooth transition from current capitalrequirements to a risk-weighted capital rule.A number of these comments have been rendered moot by the FIRREA. The capitalregulations will be effective on December 7, 1989, as provided by FIRREA,section 5(t)(1)(D). The Office is providing a transition period from December7, 1989 to December 30, 1990 that requires savings associations to maintaincapital in an amount greater than or equal to 80% of the amount they willbe required to maintain on or after December 31, 1992. Between December31, 1990 and December 30, 1992, all savings associations will be requiredto maintain capital in an amount greater than or equal to 90% of the amountthey will be required to maintain on or after December 31, 1992. All savingsassociations will be required to satisfy the fully phased-in risk-basedcapital requirement by December 31, 1992.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Regulation</ITAG>A. DefinitionsFIRREA instructs the Office to include in its capital standards ``all relevantsubstantive definitions'' that the OCC has established for national banks,subject to the following special rule: ``If the [OCC] has not made effectiveregulations defining core capital or establishing a risk-based standard,the Director shall use the definition and standard contained in the [OCC's]most recently published final regulations.'' HOLA, section 5(t)(10)(A)and (B).In accordance with the statutory mandate, the definitions contained inthe regulation correspond, for the most part, to the definitions prescribedby the OCC in its recent final guidelines. Some definitional sections havebeen modified to reflect the differences between the terminology used inthe thrift and banking industries. In particular, the term ``general valuationloan and lease loss allowances'' is used to refer to ``allowances for loanand lease losses'' and the term ``retained earnings'' is substituted for``undivided profits.'' The term ``capital surplus'' is not specificallymentioned because such surplus is accounted for in common stockholders'equity. Other defintions have been added to reflect statutory provisionsregarding, among other things, the treatment of qualifying supervisorygoodwill as a deduction from capital and the requirement for separate capitalizationfor certain subsidiaries.The definition of ``adjusted total assets'' is based on the OCC's definitionat 12 CFR 3.2(a), but is modified to reflect the treatment of investmentsin subsidiaries and qualifying supervisory goodwill under FIRREA.The Office has retained the definition of ``depository institution'' witha modification to clarify that savings and loan holding companies are notconsidered depository institutions.The term ``eligible savings association'' is largely taken from the provisionsof FIRREA governing the inclusion of supervisory goodwill in core capital.The Office has provided that associations will be deemed eligible unlessnotified otherwise.B. Components of CapitalFIRREA requires different capital components for each of the three capitalstandards: The risk-based capital standard, the leverage ratio capitalstandard, and the tangible capital standard. The risk-based capital standardmay be satisfied by a specified combination of core capital and supplementarycapital. The leverage ratio standard must be satisfied with core capital.The tangible capital requirement must be met with tangible capital.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Core Capital</ITAG>Core capital incldues common stockholders' equity, retained earnings, noncumulativeperpetual preferred stock \1\\0\<NOTE/> (less contra accounts such as shareholder receivables), andminority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries.For purposes of the core capital calculation, there are special rules regardingthe deduction from core capital of certain intangibles.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ Preferred stock issued by a savings association orsubsidiary that is, in effect, collateralized by assets of the savingsassociation or one of its subsidiaries is not considered part of capital,regardless of its cumulative or noncumulative characteristics. Common stockholders' equity is a ``permanent,'' <T3>i.e., </T3>nonmaturing or nonredeemable, source of protection for thesavings association and the deposit insurance fund. Common stockholders'equity includes common stock, additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.The 12/88 proposal defined core capital to include ``perpetual preferredstock,'' \1\\1\<NOTE/> without distinguishing between cumulative and noncumulativepreferred stock. The OCC's final guidelines make such a distinction andonly permit noncumulative preferred stock to be considered as Tier 1 (core)capital. Because section 5(t)(10) requires the Office to follow the definitionof core captial in the OCC's final risk-based capital guidelines, the Office'srule includes only noncumulative perpetual preferred stock in core capital,notwithstanding this Office's belief that cumulative preferred stock servesthe functions of equity capital for savings associations equally well froma public policy perspective.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ The regulation excepts preferred stock that is, ineffect, collateralized by assets of the savings association or one of itssubsidiaries. See discussion below.Noncumulative perpetual preferred stock differs from common stockholders'equity primarily in that there is a fixed requirement to pay dividends.It has no maturity and holders of such stock are residual owners of a savingsassociation rather than creditors. A savings association cannot be forcedinto insolvency by its requirement to pay dividends on this preferred stock,since the obligation to pay dividends can be suspended when the savingsassociation encounters financial difficulties. The treatment of noncumulativeperpetual preferred stock as core capital and cumulative preferred stockas supplementary capital is consistent with the standards adopted in July,1988, by the Basle Supervisors' Committee and with the definition of capitalthat the OCC has adopted.Core capital includes minority interests in equity accounts of fully-consolidatedsubsidiaries unless the Office determines in the case of a particular savingsassociation that it does not provide a cushion to absorb losses. This couldoccur, for example, where the minority interest consists of a preferredinterest in the subsidiary.Core capital also includes any pledged deposits or nonwithdrawable accountsthat meet the same criteria as noncumulative preferred stock; <T3>i.e., </T3>they are includable if there is no maturity and the obligationto pay interest (<T3>i.e., </T3>dividends) can be suspended when the savings associationencounters financial difficulties. Such items generally belong to the directorsof mutual savings associations and are pledged to the savings association.They often perform the same function for those savings associations thatpreferred stock performs for stock savings associations. Nonwithdrawableand pledged accounts that do not meet the same criteria as noncumulativeperpetual preferred stock may be counted toward supplementary capital.Per section 5(t)(3), core capital also includes, until December 31, 1994,goodwill (FSLIC Capital Contributions) resulting from prior regulatoryaccounting practices. This goodwill is gradually phased out over this fiveyear period.a. <T3>Deductions from core capital. </T3>Generally, for purposes of the corecapital requirement, all intangible assets are excluded from assets andmust therefore be deducted from core capital. Nevertheless, FIRREA permitscertain items to be included in assets and, therefore, does not requiresuch items to be deducted in core capital calculations as discussed below.The OCC permits those intangibles that meet its three-part test to be includedin assets. 54 FR 4168, 4179 (Jan. 27, 1989) (Deductions from Tier 1 capitalat (c)(2)). The Office will accordingly permit, on a case-by-case basis,savings associations to include those intangible assets that qualify underthe three-part test, 12 CFR 567.5(a)(2)(ii), in assets up to 25% of corecapital, except for purchased mortgage servicing rights, which are treatedseparately by the statute and thus by these regulations.FIRREA made separate provision for inclusion in assets of two types ofintangibles: Qualifying supervisory goodwill and purchased mortgage servicingrights. The amount of qualifying supervisory goodwill that may be includedby an eligible association \12\<NOTE/> in assets and, therefore, need not be deducted from corecapital, may not exceed the applicable percentage of adjusted total assetsset forth in the following table:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ ``Eligible savings association'' is defined at 12 CFR567.1(h). <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p7,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s20,8</C> <H1> </H1><H1/><T3>Percent</T3><ITAG tagnum="1">Prior to January 1, 1992<D>1.500 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">January 1, 1991-December 31, 1992<D>1.000 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">January 1, 1993-December 31, 1993<D>0.750 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">January 1, 1994-December 31, 1994<D>0.375 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Thereafter<D>0</D></ITAG></ITAG>FIRREA also specifically provides for inclusion of purchased mortgage servicingrights in assets. Purchased mortgage servicing rights may be included inassets (i.e., there is no deduction from core or tangible capital) onlyto the extent allowed by the FDIC. In the Joint Explanatory Statement ofthe Committee of Conference,\13\<NOTE/> House and Senate conferees indicated that, in calculatingcore capital for the three capital standards, the Office ``shall permit''savings associations to treat purchased mortgage servicing rights in amanner no less stringent than they are treated under regulations prescribedby the FDIC and the OCC. The conferees referred to the OCC's standardswith respect to purchased mortgage servicing in discussing the qualitativestandards for marketability, valuation, and separability of such servicingthat the Office ``may prescribe'' for the capital standards of savingsassociations. The conferees specifically stated, however, that the capitalstandards for savings associations should not be limited to OCC quantitativestandards for tangible capital. The Office will therefore rely on the FDIC'squantitative standards for the treatment of purchased mortgage servicingrights, modified to comport with the provisions of FIRREA. At present boththe OCC and the FDIC apply the same qualitative standards, which this Officeintends to follow: If, however, one of these regulators were to reviseits qualitative standards, this Office would take appropriate action.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ H.R. Conf. Rep. No. 101-222, 101st Cong., 1st Sess. 405(1989). b. <T3>Deductions from core and tangible capital. </T3>Section 5(t)(5) ofthe HOLA requires that investments in certain nonincludable subsidiariesmust be deducted, in increasing amounts, in determining compliance withall capital standards established under section 5(t)(1) over a five yearphase-out period. This rule, therefore, deducts such investments for purposesof determining a savings association's tangible and core capital pursuantto andSection; 567.5(a)(2) and andSection; 567.9(c). Nonincludable subsidiariesare, generally, those engaged as principal in activities not permissiblefor national banks.Any subsidiary that is engaged in activities permissible for a nationalbank or is engaged in activities not permissible for a national bank, butsolely as an agent, or is itself a depository institution (acquired directlyor indirectly before May 1, 1989) will be consolidated with the parentfor purposes of capital and deduction of the investment in the subsidiaryis not required. Where the association has a ownership interest not consolidatedunder GAAP in a subsidiary engaged in permissible activity, the consolidationis prorated. That is, the association's percentage interest in the subsidiaryis multiplied by the subsidiary's assets and the resulting amount is consolidatedwith the parent association. The assets consolidated in this manner areplaced in the 100% risk-weight category. When the association has a majorityinterest in a subsidiary, assets are fully consolidated. The assets ofthe majority-owned subsidiary are risk-weighted in the same manner as assetsof the parent.With respect to subsidiaries that are engaged in activities that are notpermitted for national banks, FIRREA requires that all of an association'sinvestments in such subsidiaries so engaged after April 12, 1989 must immediatelybe deducted from assets. For subsidiaries engaged in such activities priorto April 12, 1989, the Act provides a transition period whereby associationsmust deduct a certain percentage of their investments in such subsidiarieseach year. By July 1994, all investments in subsidiaries engaged in activitiesnot permitted for national banks must be deducted from assets and, thus,capital. During the phase-in of this requirement, the rule requires thatthe assets of subsidiaries that engage in activities not permitted fornational banks (where the amount of the investment has not been fully deducted)be consolidated on a prorated basis to the extent of the remaining investment.Thus, during the phase-in period, associations must multiply their ownershipinterest in a subsidiary engaged in activities not permitted for nationalbanks by the subsidiary's assets and by that portion of its investmentthat is not deducted under the phase-in schedule. This treatment appliesto all investments in subsidiaries whether the association's investmentconstitutes a minority or majority interest.When a savings association, after May 1, 1989, acquires a depository institution,either directly or through a subsidiary, the sole investment of which isa depository institution or institutions, the savings association's investmentin the lower tier depository institution (or intermediate subsidiary) willbe deducted in determining capital compliance under all three capital standardsunless the lower tier depository institution is engaged solely in activitiespermissible for a national bank or the Office determines that the capitalrequirement for the parent savings association would be higher if the assetsand liabilities of the parent and subsidiary were consolidated. Where theOffice creates such a determination, assets and liabilities of such lowertier subsidiaries will be consolidated with those of the parent savingsassociation for purposes of determining compliance with capital standards,pursuant to sections 5(t)(5)(A) and 5(t)(5)(E).Where such investments have been acquired before May 1, 1989, regardlessof whether the lower tier depository institution is engaged in activitiesnot permissible for a national bank, the investment will not be deductedin determining capital compliance, pursuant to section 5(t)(5)(C)(ii).While section (5)(t)(5)(E) does not require the Office to consolidate suchsubsidiaries with the parent savings association for purposes of determiningcompliance with capital standards, neither that section nor section (5)(t)(5)(C)requires the Office to treat such investments in a particular way, leavingthat determination to the Office. The Office is aware of a colloquy betweenSenators Garn and D'Amato on this issue on August 4, 1989 that indicatesthat the statute does not require such consolidation and that the capitalrequirements should be applied separately to each savings association.See Cong. Rec. S. 10199 (Aug. 4, 1989). The Office is very concerned, however,about the ``double leveraging'' of capital by savings associations inherentin such structures if such investments are not consolidated. Additionally,the Office wishes to minimize any incentives the parent savings associationmay have to only minimally capitalize the lower tier depository institution.While the Office believes that the exclusion treatment for non-depositoryinstitution subsidiaries, depending upon their activities, is appropriate,in part because such treatment does encourage savings associations to minimizesuch investments, it believes that depository institution subsidiariesshould be more than minimally capitalized. The Office therefore has determinedto require consolidation of the assets and liabilities of such subsidiarieswith those of the parent savings association for purposes of determiningcapital compliance. Such treatment is consistent with the FDIC's generaltreatment of investments in subsidiaries representing majority ownershipin another federally insured depository institution. See 54 FR 11511 n.10(March 21, 1989).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Supplementary Capital</ITAG>Supplementary capital elements count towards a savings association's totalcapital up to a maximum of 100% of the association's core capital. Supplementarycapital elements are divided into three categories: permanent capital instruments,maturing capital instruments, and general valuation loan and lease lossallowances.Core capital is the most permanent form of capital and places the leastamount of fixed obligations on the savings association. It therefore providesthe best protection for the savings association and the insurance fund.Nevertheless, there are circumstances when issuing equity can prove tobe expensive in terms of the savings association's future ability to raisecapital and, therefore, detrimental to a savings association. Dependingon market conditions, the issuance of equity securities by a savings associationmay prove to be very costly in comparison to other methods of raising capital,such as the issuance of debt. The Office continues to believe such otherinstruments should be included as components of capital for purposes ofmeeting capital requirements. Thus, the definition of total capital shouldenable savings associations to raise a portion of their capital from lesscostly sources when appropriate.Supplementary capital is comprised of those debt or equity instrumentsthat are not as permanent as or have less certain value than the componentsof core capital. Supplementary capital components include: mandatory convertiblesubordinated debt (both capital notes and commitment notes), net worthand capital certificates, perpetual subordinated debt, mandatory redeemablepreferred stock, qualifying subordinated debt, and general valuation loanand lease loss allowances.Perpetual preferred stock is preferred stock without a fixed maturity datethat cannot be redeemed at the option of the holder. With one exception,discussed below, perpetual preferred stock instruments qualify for inclusionin supplementary capital. Cumulative perpetual preferred stock qualifiesas supplementary capital, as discussed above, consistent with the OCC'sdetermination to exclude such preferred stock from its Tier 1 (core) capital.Preferred stock with a dividend rate that is periodically reset in an auction-typeprocess to reflect the creditworthiness of the issuer\14\<NOTE/> is included as supplementary capital only, regardless ofwhether dividends are cumulative or not. Furthermore, in order to meetthe definition of perpetual preferred stock, the issue may not be redeemedat the option of the holder of the instrument or have other provisionsthat would require future redemption of the stock.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\Examples of such auction-type processes are: Dutch auction,auction rate, remarketable, and money market preferred stock.An exception to the inclusion of perpetual preferred stock in supplementarycapital is the preferred stock issued by a savings association or subsidiarythat is, in effect, collateralized by assets. Because this stock has aclaim on assets that is senior to that of the FDIC, such instruments donot qualify as capital.Mutual capital certificates, net worth certificates, and income capitalcertificates remain in supplementary capital as set forth in the 12/88proposal.Pledged deposits and nonwithdrawable accounts generally belong to the ownersor directors of the savings association and are pledged to the association.Because owners of such instruments are subordinated to the savings association,they are included in either core or supplementary capital, depending uponwhether they could satisfy the same criteria as noncumulative preferredstock.a. <T3>Transition Rules for Maturing Capital Instruments. </T3>The characteristicsof maturing capital instruments require some form of special provisionfor their inclusion in capital. These instruments present a refunding riskto the savings associations that issue them. If these types of instrumentsare not refunded they could cause a precipitous reduction in the capitalposition of a savings association. For this reason, the amount of maturingcapital instruments eligible for inclusion in supplementary capital islimited or discounted as the investment approaches maturity.The Office is establishing two categories of rules for the inclusion ofmaturing capital instruments in supplementary capital. The first rule appliesto all maturing capital instruments issued by savings associations on orbefore November 7, 1989. The second category applies to maturing capitalinstruments that were issued after November 7, 1989. Under the second category,a savings association issuing such instruments has two options from whichto choose. One option focuses upon the amount of all outstanding maturingcapital instruments that will mature in a particular period as a percentageof capital. The second focuses upon the amortization of each particularissuance. Once an association selects an option, however, that option appliesto all maturing capital instruments subsequently issued by the associationfor as long as there is a balance outstanding of post-November 7, 1989,issuances. Only when the balance of post-November 7, 1989, maturing capitalinstruments issued pursuant to the originally selected option have beenrepaid will the association be permitted to select the other option fornew issuances. This limitation is necessary to avoid double-counting.The rule that applies to maturing capital instruments issued before November7, 1989, is identical to the schedule set forth at 12 CFR 561.13(c)(1)(1988). The rule, which is similar to the approach previously allowed bythe federal banking agencies, requires maturing capital instruments tobe amortized at the rate of \1/7\, or approximately 14%, per year duringthe final seven years to maturity. As discussed in detail in the 12/88proposal, the Office believes that this treatment may result in such instrumentsbecoming an increasingly expensive form of capital as they near maturity.This may result in savings associations relying on longer-term funds andhaving to pay higher interest rates or incurring unnecessary transactioncosts for refunding instruments earlier than necessary. The Office is retainingthese provisions for the reasons discussed in the summary of comments.The second category of rules consists of the two amortization options formaturing capital instrument issued after November 7, 1989. The first optionis the rule that appears in section 2(b)(2) of the OCC's final guidelines.54 FR at 4179. It reduces the outstanding amount of the maturing capitalinstruments that would count as supplementary capital by a fifth of theoriginal amount (less redemptions) each year during the instrument's lastfive years before maturity. This approach is similar to the prior amortizationrule except the amortization period has been shortened from seven to fiveyears.To avoid the adverse effects of the present rule and the OCC's treatmentof these items, while continuing to protect the Office's interest in encouragingstrong capital positions for savings associations, the Office is including,as discussed above, an alternate amortization option for the treatmentof maturing capital instruments. This option would limit (for inclusionin capital for purposes of this regulation) the aggregate amount of capitalthat matures in any one year during the seven years immediately prior toan instrument's maturity to 20% of the association's capital. If a savingsassociation wishes to hold, and to count for purposes of this rule, maturingcapital that is greater than 20% of capital, it must spread the maturitiesover two or more years so that no more than an amount equal to 20% of capitalwill mature in any one year.b. <T3>General Valuation Loan and Lease Loss Allowances. </T3>This Office,like the OCC, is concerned about the degree of protection afforded by anotherelement of supplementary capital, general valuation loan and lease lossallowances. General valuation loan and lease loss allowances are establishedthrough a charge against earnings to absorb inherent but unidentified losseson loans. They do not include allowances held for specifically identifiedlosses or earmarked for a specified asset. In the Office's view, generalvaluation loan and lease loss allowances represent, effectively, a segregationof retained earnings and therefore are appropriately includable in meetingcapital requirements. Because they do represent potential losses to theassociation, however, they are a limited component of capital. Under theguidelines adopted by the OCC, general reserves for loan and lease lossesincludable in capital are phased down to 1.25% of risk-weighted assets.The Director is adopting a similar limitation for thrifts' general valuationloan and lease loss allowances. Initially, allowances for such items, asa component of capital, may constitute no more than 1.5 percent of risk-weightedassets. At the end of 1992 and thereafter they may constitute no more than1.25 percent of risk-weighted assets.Although some associations may perceive the limit as a disincentive forprudent allowance practices, every savings association must still maintainadequate general loan and lease loss allowances. The Office will continueto enforce the standards for general valuation loan and lease loss allowanceadequacy on a case-by-case basis through its supervisory process.c. <T3>Other items included as components of capital in the 12/88 proposal.</T3>Deferred loan losses were included in the 12/88 proposal because theCompetitive Equality Banking Act of 1987 required that such items be includedin capital. Their inclusion, however, would not be consistent with eitherGAAP or OCC rules. As a result, they are no longer includable in determiningcapital. Appraised equity capital, the excess of historical cost over marketvalue of shares in liquid asset mutual fund investments, and other riskanalysis reporting components are no longer components of capital becausetheir inclusion is neither permitted by the OCC, nor consistent with theclear congressional intent that thrift capital, both core and supplementary,be materially equivalent to bank capital. As such, they are no longer includablein assets for savings associations and are thus removed from capital.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Deductions from Total Capital </ITAG>Reciprocal holdings of capital instruments issued by other depository institutionsare deducted from a savings association's total capital. Reciprocal holdingsare cross-holdings or other formal or informal agreements in which twoor more depository institutions swap, exchange, or otherwise agree to holdeach other's capital instruments. Generally, as this definition implies,deductions are limited to intentional cross-holdings. These items are excludedfor two reasons. First, the Office is concerned that such holdings couldcause cross failures among depository institutions, including savings associations.Second, FIRREA directs that this Office parallel the substance of the OCC'sregulation, which excludes such holdings from capital calculations. All equity investments, except for investments in subsidiaries, are beingexcluded from calculations of total capital because they represent a highdegree of variability of risk similar to investments in subsidiaries, whichare specifically dealt with in section 5(t)(5) of the HOLA. The Officehas therefore determined to treat them similarly to the treatment FIRREAmandates for investments of non-includable subsidiaries. The Office isnot required, however, to deduct these investments from core and tangiblecapital for purposes of its capital standards. It is therefore phasingthem out from calculations of total capital over a five-year period. Inthe interim, the amount not excluded is placed in the 100% risk weightcategory.Finally, the Office is also excluding from assets and therefore from calculationsof total capital, that portion of a non-residential construction or landloan that is above an 80% loan-to-value-ratio. The Office's experiencewith its equity risk investment regulation (which treats such loans asequity risk investments) has been that such high loan-to-value loans presentparticularly high levels of risk. It has determined that those positionsof the loan above the 80% loan-to-value ratio should not be inclduded incalculating capital. C. Credit Risk Weightings There have been several adjustments made to the risk weighting assignmentsin the regulation. These adjustments generally reflect three concerns:(1) The statutory requirement that the capital standards for thrifts beno less stringent than those of national banks; (2) the ability to differentiatefrom the bank regulations in areas where thrifts have a particular expertiseand the Office believes there are different risks inherent in such assets;and (3) where today's rule, because it does not yet contain an interest-raterisk component, places certain assets in higher credit risk categoriesas an interim measure to account for their high level of risk related tointerest rate fluctuations.<ITAG tagnum="81">1. On-Balance Sheet Assets </ITAG>The Office has lowered the risk weighting of GNMA securities and placedthem in the 0% category. The underlying FHA/VA (to the extent they areguaranteed) mortgage loans, on the other hand, have been placed in the20% category rather than in the 0% category, as proposed. This revisionnot only makes the treatment of GNMAs and FHA/VA mortgages consistent withthe banking regulators, but also more accurately reflects the credit riskassociated with each asset. The rule lowers the risk weighting of deposit reserves and other balancesat Federal Reserve Banks as well as the book value of paid-in Federal ReserveBank stock to the 0% category, consistent with the OCC's treatment of claimson and stock of Federal Reserve Banks. Likewise, items collateralized bycash have been raised from the 0% to the 20% risk-weight category. The Office has determined to retain in this rule the treatment affordedhigh quality private issue mortgage-backed securities, <T3>i.e., </T3>placing them in the same 20% risk-weight category as suchsecurities issued by FHLMC or FNMA. The Office has carefully reviewed thehistory and characteristics of such securities and believes that this riskweight is appropriate. Such securities are generally placed in the 50%risk-weight category under the OCC's final guidelines. As discussed in the summary of comments, the rule places securities withresidual characteristics and all stripped mortgage-backed securities, includinginterest-only and principal-only portions in the 100% risk-weight category.This treatment is consistent with the OCC and reflects the risk inherentin these instruments as compared to typical mortgage-backed securities.This treatment will be reconsidered in conjunction with an adoption ofan interest rate risk component.The Office has placed claims on certain foreign governments and depositoryinstitutions and official multilateral lending institutions or regionaldevelopment institutions in the same risk-weight categories as the OCC.Goodwill and equity investments that are not deducted from assets and,thus, from capital and non-investment grade corporate debt securities areplaced in the 100% risk-weight category. The Office had considered assigningrisk-weights in excess of 100% to these assets in its proposal. FIRREArequires that supervisory goodwill be phased-out as a component of capitalover a five-year period. State-chartered savings associations are generallyprohibited from making new equity investments. FIRREA also requires thatthrifts divest themselves of investments in non-investment grade corporatedebt securities and most equity securities no later than July 1, 1994.The Office has determined that a ``super'' risk-weighting of these assetsis not necessary given the restrictions contained in FIRREA. A thrift'sminority interest in a subsidiary that engages in permissible activitiesthat would not be consolidated under GAAP will, for capital purposes, beconsolidated in a prorated fashion, whereby the association will multiplyits percentage of ownership in the subsidary by the subsidiary's assets.\15\<NOTE/> For purposes of the risk-based capital rule, that amountis placed in the 100% risk-weight category. No capital will be requiredagainst the investment in the subsidiary for capital purposes. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ Assets, for this purpose, should be assets as determinedin most recently available GAAP report, but in no event should the reportbe greater than one year old. The Office has retained one risk-weight category in excess of the 100%category for standard risk assets. All assets (except 1-4 family residentialmortgages) that are more than 90 days past due and assets in foreclosureare assigned a 200% risk-weighting. Those 1-4 family residential mortgagesthat are more than 90 days past due will be placed in the 100% risk-weightcategory (double the risk-weight of a current qualifying residential mortgage).<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Off-Balance Sheet Items</ITAG>In today's rule, unused commitments with an original maturity of one yearor less have a 0% credit conversion factor. Unused commitments with anoriginal maturity of greater than one year are also assigned a 0% creditconversion factor, if unconditionally cancelable and the savings associationhas the contractual right to and, in fact, does make a separate creditdecision based upon the borrower's current financial condition before eachdrawdown.Unused portions of retail credit card lines that are unconditionally cancelableby the savings association in accordance with applicable law are in the0% credit conversion category, as are home equity lines of credit unconditionallycancelable by the association in accordance with federal law. A 50% creditconversion factor is assigned to unused portions of other commitments,including home equity lines of credit, with an original maturity exceedingone year.D. Leverage Ratio and Tangible Capital RequirementsToday's rule implements a leverage ratio of 3% of adjusted total assetsheld in the form of core capital for savings associations. The leverageratio is to ensure that savings associations maintain a level of capitaladequate to protect from fraud, mismanagement and other risks that arenot accounted for by measuring capital against risk-weighted assets. TheOCC did not provide for a leverage limit in its final guidelines, but hasannounced its intention to propose a 3% leverage limit to be effectivesimultaneously with the effective date of the guidelines.The Office is, therefore, consistent with FIRREA and the actions of theOCC, adopting a minimum leverage ratio requirement for savings associationsat the same level as the OCC has proposed to use in conjunction with itsfinal risk-based capital guidelines. If, in any final rule, the OCC modifieseither the level of this leverage ratio or the elements of capital thatcan be used to satisfy the requirement, the Office will revisit this provisionand make any necessary revisions consistent with sections 5(t)(i)(C) and5(t)(2)(A) of the HOLA.The Office has provided for tangible capital in the amount of 1.5% of adjustedtotal assets in today's rule. Since the OCC does not define tangible capital,the Office has adopted the definition contained in FIRREA, <T3>i.e., </T3>tangible capital means core capital minus any intangibleassets as defined by the OCC. The rule adopts the OCC's definition of intangibleassets for purposes of tangible capital as well as other capital standards.E. Transition and Effective Date<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Risk-Based Capital Standards</ITAG>Section 5(t)(1)(D) requires these regulations regarding capital standardsto be effective on December 7, 1989. All savings associations are requiredto meet their fully phased-in risk-based capital requirements by December31, 1992, the date the OCC final risk-based capital guidelines will befully phased-in except that certain items that the FIRREA phases out overa longer period of time will continue to be included, in decreasing amounts,according to the statutory schedules. These schedules are discussed insection E.2 below. The final rule contains a transition period for meetingthe fully-phased in risk-based capital requirement. For the period betweenDecember 7, 1989 and December 30, 1990, savings associations must attainand maintain no less than 80% of the amount of capital that will be requiredunder the risk-based capital standard on December 31, 1992. For the periodbetween December 31, 1990 and December 30, 1992, savings associations mustattain and maintain no less than 90% of the amount of capital that willbe required under the risk-based capital standard on December 31, 1992.Thereafter, the risk-based capital standard will be 100% of that amount.The tangible capital and leverage ratio requirements must be satisfiedin total as of the effective date of these regulations, December 7, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="81">2.

Notwithstandingthis provision, the statute provides that, if a savings association's subsidiarywas engaged, as of April 12, 1989, in investments that are not permittedfor national banks, the savings association may include the lesser of itsinvestments in and extensions of credit to the subsidiary on April 12,1989 or its investments in and extensions of credit to the subsidiary onthe date its capital is being determined, in accordance with the applicablepercentage as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/> <H1> </H1><H1>Percent</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Prior to July 1, 1990 <D>100</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">July 1, 1990_June 30, 1991 <D>90</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">July 1, 1991_June 30, 1992 <D>75</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">July 1, 1992_June 30, 1993 <D>60</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">July 1, 1993_June 30, 1994 <D>40</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Thereafter <D>0</D></ITAG></ITAG>F. Consequences of FailureThe Office has added a section dealing specifically with the consequencesof failing the minimum capital requirements under the regulations. Thissection combines the remedies that were formerly contained in andSection;563.13(d) and those mandated by FIRREA. In particular, FIRREA requiresany savings association not in compliance with the capital regulationsto submit a plan to the Director detailing its efforts to correct its capitalsituation. Submission of such plans is not an enforcement action by thisOffice. Under section 5(t)(6)(A)(ii) of FIRREA, the Director must requirethe submission of these plans. Prior to January 1, 1991 the Director mayalso restrict the asset growth of any savings association that is not incompliance with the capital standards. On and after January 1, 1991, assetgrowth must be prohibited under the terms of the Act except as providedunder limited circumstances where any increase in assets is accompaniedby an increase in tangible capital.In addition to these regulatory provisions, the Office will provide guidanceto savings associations regarding the process for applications to be exemptedfrom sanctions or excepted from the capital standards. As part of thiseffort, details relating to the content of capital plans, the standardsby which they will be judged, and the process to be followed in filingthem with the Office will be forthcoming. The Office intends to notify each savings association that it believeswill fail one or more of the capital requirements as of December 7, 1989and direct each to file a capital plan or rebut the Office's contentionof failure. There are no required forms to be submitted as part of thecapital plan process. Each savings association's plan will differ and shouldreflect the association's unique facts and circumstances. As part of theprocess, savings associations will be required to certify to the Directorthat during the pendency of their applications they will not grow beyondinterest credited, make any capital distributions, or engage in any activityprohibited under FIRREA or otherwise act in a manner inconsistent withlimitations established by the Office for associations not meeting theircapital requirements. Applications not containing such certifications arenot acceptable capital plans. These capital plans will be used by the Officein determining the capital adequacy of these savings associations. Savingsassociations whose capital plans are rejected will be subject to immediaterestrictions on growth and in any other areas the Director determines tobe appropriate for that particular association.The Office will apply Regulatory Bulletin 3a, which restricts the growthof undercapitalized savings associations to a maximum of interest creditedon liabilities. These growth restrictions will be imposed until the savingsassociation has met the minimum capital standards.Savings associations seeking exemptions from sanctions, other than post-1991growth restrictions, that the Director may impose upon undercapitalizedsavings associations must apply to the Director. As part of that application,those savings associations must submit a capital plan. The Office willgive the review of capital plans and applications for exemptions a highpriority. The Office expects to issue more detailed supervisory guidanceon these important issues in the immediate future. G. Reservations of AuthorityConsistent with the OCC's capital regulations appearing at 12 CFR part3 and its risk-based capital guidelines appearing at the Appendix to thatPart, the Office has added a new section 567.12, dealing with the residualauthority of the Office to address certain items on a case-by-case basisto ensure that the purpose of the statute and regulations is carried out.H. Comparison with OCC Final Risk-Based Capital GuidelinesToday's regulation, as discussed above, has been modeled closely on thefinal risk-based guidelines adopted by the OCC for national banks. Therisk-based sections of the regulation are not identical to those guidelines,however, because the Office has determined that certain statutory requirements,the mutual structure of a large number of savings associations (which hasno counterpart in national bank structure), the nature of thrift portfolios,the types and magnitude of risks associated with them, and the Office'sexperience mandate different treatment of certain assets and certain componentsof capital. The areas of difference are set forth in this section. Overall,the Office believes that even with these differences, the rule, in theaggregate, results in a risk-based capital regulation materially equivalentto the OCC's final guidelines.The primary areas of difference are in: (1) Mortgages and mortgage-relatedassets; (2) the risk-weighting of repossessed and past-due assets, obligationsof and assets covered by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporationor a successor agency; (3) the phased-out exclusion from assets and capitalcalculations of supervisory goodwill, equity investments, certain highloan-to-value loans, and investments in certain subsidiaries; (4) the inclusionof certain nonwithdrawable accounts and pledged deposits in core capitalfor mutual savings associations where such instruments meet the same criteriaas noncumulative preferred stock; (5) an alternative treatment of maturingcapital instruments; and (6) an accelerated transition period on the limitedinclusion of general valuation loan and lease loss allowances, the lackof the OCC's transitional inclusion of a percentage of Tier 2 (supplementary)capital in determining Tier 1 (core) capital, and an immediate effectivedate for the risk-based capital standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291</ITAG>It is certified that this regulation does not constitute a ``major rule''and, therefore, does not require the preparation of a final regulatoryimpact analysis.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis</ITAG>Pursuant to section 3 of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 603,the Office is providing the following regulatory flexibility analysis:1. <T3>Need for and objectives of the rule. </T3>These elements are incorporatedabove in <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>.2. <T3>Issues raised by comments and agency assessment and response. </T3>Theseelements are incorporated above in <T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION</T2>.3. <T3>Significant alternatives minimizing small entity impact and agencyresponse. </T3>This rule will not have a disproportionate impact on smallsavings associations. Section 5(t) of the Home Owners' Loan Act of 1933requires the Office to promulgate ``uniformly applicable capital standardsfor savings associations.'' The Office believes that there are no significantalternatives to the rule that will adequately address the Office's statutoryresponsibility to promulgate such regulations. While the Office anticipatesthat all savings associations may have to make some revisions to theirreporting procedures, the Office intends that any required revisions willtry to minimize the burden on small savings associations to the extentconsistent with providing adequate information for supervisory monitoringof their capital ratios. The regulation will have the most significantimpact on those savings associations that do not have sufficient capitalin relation to their asset size or risk profiles.Administrative Procedure ActPursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3), the office finds goods cause for waivingthe 30-day delay of effective date provisions of the Administrative ProcedureAct in that FIRREA requires these regulations to be effective 120 daysafter enactment of the law. Thus, these regulations will be effective onDecember 7, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subject</ITAG>12 CFR Part 561Savings associations.12 CFR Part 563Accounting, Advertising, Bank deposit insurance, Currency, Flood insurance,Investments, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings associations.12 CFR Part 567Currency, Reporting and recoredkeeping requirements, Savings associations.Accordingly, the Office hereby amends parts 561, 563 and 567, subchapterD, chapter V, title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below.1.

Before the Office will considera request to proportionately risk-weight such a portfolio, the savingsassociation must have and maintain current information for the reportingperiod that details the composition of the portfolio of assets.(2) <T3>Off-Balance Sheet Activities. </T3>Risk weights for off-balance sheetitems are determined by a two-step process. First, the face amount of theoff-balance sheet item must be multiplied by the appropriate credit conversionfactor listed in this section. This calculation translates the face amountof an off-balance sheet exposure into an on-balance sheet credit-equivalentamount. Second, the credit-equivalent amount must be assigned to the appropriaterisk-weight category depending on the obligor (<T3>i.e., </T3>the 20 percent risk-weight category if the obligor is adomestic depository institution or the 100 percent risk category if theobligor is a private party), <T3>provided that, </T3>the maximum risk-weight assigned to the credit-equivalentamount of an interest-rate or exchange-rate contract is 50 percent. Guaranteesand other direct credit substitutes by savings associations of the obligationsof their service corporations and subsidiaries that qualify as equity investmentsare assigned a credit-equivalent amount of the entire value of the directcredit substitute. The following are the credit conversion factors andthe off-balance sheet items to which they apply:(i) <T3>100 percent credit conversion factor (Group A). </T3>(A) Direct creditsubstitutes, including financial guarantee-type standby letters of creditthat support financial claims on the account party. The face amount ofa direct credit substitute is netted against the amount of any participationssold in that item (except as otherwise provided below). The amount retainedby the savings association is converted to an on-balance sheet equivalentand assigned to the proper risk-weight category using the criteria regardingobligors, guarantors and collateral listed herein. Participations are treatedas follows:(<T3>1</T3>) If the originating savings association remains liable to thebeneficiary for the full amount of the standby letter of credit, in theevent the participant fails to perform under its participation agreement,the amount of participations sold are converted to an on-balance sheetcredit equivalent using a credit conversion factor of 100%, with that amountthen being assigned to the risk-weight category appropriate for the purchaserof the participation.(<T3>2</T3>) If participations are such that each participant is responsibleonly for its pro-rata share of the risk, and there is no recourse to theoriginating institution, the full amount of the participations sold isexcluded from the originating institution's risk-weighted assets;(B) Risk participations purchased in bankers' acceptances and participationspurchased in direct credit substitutes;(C) Assets sold under an agreement to repurchase and the value of assetssold with recourse, to the extent these assets are not included in thesavings association's total assets, except where the amount of recourseliability retained by a savings association is less than the capital requirementfor credit-risk exposure, in which case capital must be maintained equalto the amount of credit-risk exposure retained. This category includesloan strips sold without direct recourse where the maturity of the participationis shorter than the maturity of the underlying loan and the ownership ofthe subordinated portion of a loan participation or package of loans. Thiscategory includes loans serviced by associations where the associationis subject to losses on the loans, commonly referred to as ``recourse servicing''.(Where associations hold a participation certificate (``PC'') in a mortgageloan swap with recourse or a subordinated portion as an on-balance sheetasset, the PC or subordinated portion is <T3>not </T3>to be risk-weighted for purposes of the risk-base capitalrequirement. Instead, the procedure outlined above is to be followed.);(D) Forward agreements and other contingent obligations with a certaindraw down, <T3>e.g., </T3>legally binding agreements to purchase assets at a specifiedfuture date. On the date an institution enters into a forward agreementor similar obligation, it should convert the principal amount of the assetsto be purchased at 100 percent as of that date and then assign this amountto the risk-weight category appropriate to the obligor or guarantor ofthe item, or the nature of the collateral;(E) Indemnification of customers whose securities the savings associationhas lent as agent. If the customer is not indemnified against loss by thesavings association, the transaction is excluded from the risk-based capitalcalculation. When a savings assocation lends its own securities, the transactionis treated as a loan.

A savings associationmay net multiple contracts with a single counterparty only if those contractsare subject to novation. The term ``novation'' means a bilateral contractbetween two counterparties under which any obligation to each other todeliver a given currency on a given date is automatically amalgamated withall other obligations for the same currency and value date, legally substitutingone single net amount for the previous gross obligations; and(<T3>2</T3>) Potential credit exposure, <T3>i.e., </T3>an estimate of the potential increase in credit exposureover the remaining life of the contract.
