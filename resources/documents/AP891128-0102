Certainly a highmortality rate in the donor would not give one much enthusiasm forcontinuing this,'' Kahan said Tuesday.   Surgeons at the University of Chicago Medical Center on Mondaybecame the first in the country to perform a living-donor livertransplant.   Teresa Smith, 29, a teacher from Schertz, Texas, had about athird of her liver removed and placed into her 21-month-olddaughter, Alyssa, who had been waiting more than a year for a liverfrom a brain-dead donor.   Doctors who performed the dual operations predicted success forAlyssa, despite additional surgery Tuesday to stop internalbleeding. Expectations also were high for Mrs. Smith, whose spleenwas removed after the organ accidentally was damaged in surgery.   Dr. Robert Gordon of the University of Pittsburgh, the world'sleading transplant center, said he hopes doctors are ``a littlemore cautious about jumping into this'' than they have been in thepast with other medical advances.   ``It's one thing to just give new medicine,'' Gordon said.``It's another thing to subject healthy, living donors to asurgical procedure without giving careful consideration to it. Ifyou do any harm, the negative impact would be enormous.''   For Kahan, a 1 percent mortality rate among donating parents, orone death in every 100 cases, would be acceptable provided thechild had a 50 percent or more chance of being alive five yearsafter surgery.   The mortality rate for people donating one of their two kidneysto ill relatives is about 0.1 percent, or one death in every 1,000cases, according to Kahan.   ``Liver donation is a much trickier operation,'' he said. ``Andof course, the delayed complications can be appreciably greater.''   Despite the uncertainties, transplant specialists around thecountry are hopeful the Chicago operation could turn around theexcruciating lack of livers for pre-school children.   Of the 749 people awaiting liver transplants in the UnitedStates on Monday, 156 were younger than age 6, according to Dr.William Vaughn, director of research for the United Network forOrgan Sharing. Most, like Alyssa, suffer from biliary atresia, afatal blockage of the bile ducts.   Experience shows as many as half the 156 children will diewaiting, according to Dr. John Najarian, chairman of the Universityof Minnesota's department of surgery.   Appalled by such figures, transplant surgeons a few years agobegan trimming livers from brain-dead adults to fit into toddlers.Doctors then started splitting livers and transplanting each halfinto a young patient.   The procedures were possible because of the unique regenerativeability of the liver. Additionally, livers, unlike kidneys, do notrequire a tissue match between the donor and recipient.   Doctors, on occasion, have removed about a third of a healthyperson's pancreas and transplanted it into a diabetic relative. Sofar, there have been no major complications, according to Najarian,whose team has performed more than 70 of the procedures.   A positive part of donors who are relatives is that thetransplanted organ tends to be a closer genetic match than oneprocured from a dead stranger, according to Najarian. Thereconsequently is more likelihood the transplanted organ will work.   ``The major thrust still has to be getting as many cadaverorgans as possible and developing better'' anti-rejection drugs,Gordon said.   Many parents evidently feel the benefits outweigh any risks.Within hours of Monday's operation, the Children's Liver Foundationin Sherman Oaks, Calif., was swamped with calls about the procedure.   Arthur Caplan, director of the Center for Biomedical Ethics atthe University of Minnesota, questions the soundness of therequests.   ``Does informed consent mean anything when you're asking amother to save the life of her dying child?'' he asked. ``Whatchoice is there?''</TEXT></DOC>
