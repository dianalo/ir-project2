When it comes to pay, most companies treat up-and-comers the same way they treat the rest of the crowd, consultants say. Towers, Perrin, Forster andamp; Crosby, for instance, says 60% of the big companies it asked tend to give the same merit increases to all executives. At those companies that do differentiate, fast-trackers are getting merit increases averaging 8.8%, in contrast to the 4.9% increase awarded all managers.    But such percentage differences really don't amount to much cash, according to Hay Group, another consultant. Using its own survey data, it figures a high-achieving industrial executive last year received an 8.7% increase, while average performers got 5.5%. That means that, on a $40,000 salary, the up-and-comers received a $67-a-week raise, compared with $42 for run-of-the-mill managers, &quot;hardly enough difference to motivate performance,&quot; says Hay's Lance Berger.    Hay suggests 12% increases for the stars, 3% to 4% for average managers and nothing for underachievers.    SATURDAY HOLIDAY means long weekend for many but regular work for others.    With Independence Day falling on a Saturday this year, companies are resorting to a wide assortment of strategies for marking the holiday. Air Products andamp; Chemicals Inc., for one, is giving employees a wild day on Thursday, July 2, and also is closing on Friday, July 3. Hercules Inc. is taking off both Friday and the following Monday.    For some workers, however, it will be just another weekend. Banks, for example, are bound by state laws. As a result, Meridian Bancorp Inc. will be open both Friday and Monday. Workers, though, get an extra personal day. Nobody's complained so far, the bank-holding company says. Southeast Banking Corp. also will be open Friday and Monday. Only those who normally work Saturdays will get an Independence holiday.    FINDING A MENTOR, for women and blacks, means threading between needs.    Kathleen Cote, a vice president of Prime Computer Inc., says she's had several male mentors during her career, and she's now helping to guide young males. But Daisy Chin-Lor, a female black Oriental who is a manager at Avon Products Inc., thinks &quot;there is a basic trust when you are with someone like yourself.&quot;    And therein lies the problem for minorities and females. Looking for a minority mentor can be self-limiting, says Robert Beck, an executive vice president of BankAmerica Corp.; few have yet to achieve the top ranks of power. In trying to negotiate the corporate maze, adds Harry Johnson, a black manager at Polaroid Corp., you soon find that, &quot;by and large, it's men in that maze.&quot; And usually they're white.    American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. and BankAmerica often try to encourage the process by assigning mentors.    WHAT A DIFFERENCE a year makes. Michel David-Weill, senior partner of Lazard Freres andamp; Co., is listed by Financial World magazine as the top moneymaker on Wall Street, with earnings last year of $125 million. The winner the year before was arbitrager Ivan Boesky with $100 million. He doesn't even make the latest list.    OFFICE POLITICS getting the better of you? Better read &quot;The Art of War&quot; by Sun Tzu, &quot;A Book of Five Rings&quot; by Miyamoto Musashi and &quot;The Prince&quot; by Niccolo Machiavelli, suggests Adela Oliver of Oliver Human Resource Consultants.    COMPANY PICNICS thrive. Almost three-quarters of the managers responding to a survey by Adia Personnel Services say their companies still hold annual picnics, with families invited to come along. Most of the outings are on weekends, but 12% stage their affairs during the week on company time.    HEALTHY GROWTH: Half the medical doctors working as managers at industrial concerns are the first M.D.s to hold down their jobs, according to a survey by the American Academy of Medical Directors. And they're getting healthy pay. Doctors serving as chief executives of industrial companies earn on average $133,000 a year. Industrial medical directors pull in $108,000.    WITH ETHICAL DILEMMAS, some secretarial students could use more coaching.    When Briarcliffe, a two-year, New York business college, asked its students how they'd handle themselves in 20 delicate situations, many indicated they would follow their boss, right or wrong. More than half, for instance, would comply with a supervisor's instructions to alter board minutes or change the date on a postal meter, even though they knew it was improper. Barely one in 11 would absolutely refuse.    The students, though, do draw the line. Three-quarters of them said they would ignore a boss's request to &quot;keep it to yourself&quot; if they learned the company was discharging toxic chemicals into the water supply. They also would resist an order to remove sensitive documents from the files so the government couldn't find them.    For some, personal needs come first. Most wouldn't hesitate to call in sick if they needed a day off.    THE CHECKOFF: In Boston's tight labor market, Shawmut Bank offers a $1,000 signing bonus to successful applicants for secretarial jobs. . . . Tax relief: The Internal Revenue Service is opening its first day-care centers for the children of employees. </TEXT></DOC>
