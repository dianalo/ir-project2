The government news service Notimex on Tuesday quoted Raul RoblesSegura, assistant commercial director for the government oilmonopoly Pemex, as saying the cuts would not significantly hurtbusiness.   Robles said that during the first five months of this year Pemexalready has exceeded its profit estimates for all of 1989 by 40percent.   Robles' remarks came as OPEC oil ministers meeting in Viennatried to restart stalled negotiations over a new production andpricing agreement.   Mexico does not belong to the 13-member Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries and is not governed by the group's agreements.However, it historically has followed cartel guidelines.   OPEC talks had centered on how to divide any additionalproduction among the member countries.   The ministers seemed to agree on lifting production levels to19.5 million barrels a day, or at most 20 million barrels a day, inthe last six months of the year. The ceiling in the January-Juneperiod is 18.5 million barrels daily.   A Pemex statement released Tuesday quoted Robles as saying he wasconfident that an OPEC production cap would help maintain petroleumprices worldwide.   Robles said that during the first five months of this year, Pemexexported a daily average of 1.3 million barrels of crude oil with anaverage price of $15.32 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
