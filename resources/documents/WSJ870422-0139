Donaldson Lufkin and its parent, Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S., will invest a total of $500 million in the partnership, of which Donaldson Lufkin will be general partner. Donaldson Lufkin officials declined to say how much each party will contribute. The rest of the funds will come from between five and 10 commercial banks in the form of loans. Donaldson Lufkin officials wouldn't identify any of the banks.    Donaldson Lufkin officials said final terms of the partnership haven't been completed.    The partnership will provide short-term, &quot;bridge&quot; financing, which is often used to secure a transaction until permanent financing can be arranged. Increasingly, Wall Street firms have been using their own capital in these deals, a move that speeds the transaction and offers the Wall Street firms an opportunity for higher fees. Several firms have already set up such bridge financing funds.    Donaldson Lufkin has total capital of $766 million, which it said ranks it 12th among U.S. securities firms. </TEXT></DOC>
