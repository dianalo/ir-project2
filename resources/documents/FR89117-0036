Among other programelements, the legislation requires the Department to establish standardmethods of testing covered products. In the case of any amended test procedure,the Department is required to determine to what extent the proposed testprocedure would alter the measured efficiency.On March 13, 1987, the Department proposed to amend the test proceduresfor water heaters. The Department of Energy (DOE) today is proposing toamend the energy conservation standards for water heaters prescribed byEPCA, as amended, in order to account for changes in water heater measuredefficiency resulting from amended water heater test procedures.

Background</ITAG>Part B of Title III of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA), Pub.L. 94-163, as amended by the National Energy Conservation Policy Act (NECPA),Pub. L. 95-619, the National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA)of 1987, (Pub. L. 100-12) and the National Appliance Energy ConservationAmendments of 1988 (Pub. L. 100-357) created the Energy Conservation Programfor Consumer Products other than Automobiles.\1\<NOTE/> Thirteen consumer products subject to this program (oftenreferred to hereafter as ``covered products'') include water heaters, thesubject of today's proposed rulemaking.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ Part B of Title III of EPCA, as amended, is referred toin this notice as the ``Act.'' Part B of Title III is codified at 42 U.S.C.6291 Et seq.Under the Act, the program consists essentially of three parts: testing,labeling, and Federal energy conservation standards. The Department ofEnergy (DOE or Department), in consultation with the National Instituteof Standards and Technology (NIST), (formerly National Bureau of Standards),is required to amend or establish new test procedures as appropriate foreach of the covered products. Section 323. The purpose of the test proceduresis to provide for test results that reflect the energy efficiency, energyuse, or estimated annual operating costs of each of the covered products.Section 323(b)(3). A test procedure is not required if DOE determines byrule that one cannot be developed. Section 323(d)(1). One hundred and eightydays after a test procedure for a product is adopted, no manufacturer mayrepresent the energy consumption of, or the cost of energy consumed bythe product except as reflected in tests conducted according to the DOEprocedure. Section 323(c)(2). Test procedures appear at 10 CFR Part 430,Subpart B.Section 323(e) of the Act requires DOE to determine to what extent, ifany, a proposed test procedure would alter the measured energy efficiencyor measured energy use of any covered product as determined under the existingtest procedure. If DOE determines that an amended test procedure wouldalter the proposed standard, DOE is required to amend the standard accordingly.In determining the amended standard, DOE is required to measure the energyefficiency or energy use of representative samples of covered productswhich minimally comply with the existing standard. The average efficiencyof these representative samples tested using the amended test proceduresshall constitute the amended standard.a. Test ProceduresThe water heater test procedure was prescribed by notice issued September27, 1977. (42 FR 54110, October 4, 1977). These original procedures coupledlaboratory tests and calculations to obtain estimates of energy efficiencyand annual energy consumption for storage type electric, gas and oil waterheaters. The laboratory tests consisted of a ``cold start recovery efficiencytest,'' which measured the ability of a water heater to heat cold water,and a ``standby loss test,'' which measured the energy loss of a waterheater when not providing heated water. Recovery efficiency and percentstandby loss are then mathematically combined in the calculations to obtainan energy factor, DOE's overall measure of water heater efficiency. Also,the original procedures included calculations for determining the annualconsumption and annual operating costs. DOE amended the water heater testprocedures by notice issued August 30, 1979, in order to prescribe a ``measureof a water heater's useful capacity called first hour rating,'' where usefulcapacity is the maximum hourly demand which can be met by the water heater.(44 FR 52632, September 7, 1979).By notice published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 8, 1984 (referred to hereafter asthe ``1984 proposal''), DOE proposed to amend its test procedure for waterheaters. (49 FR 4870). The purpose of the 1984 proposal was threefold:First, to extend coverage of the test procedure to heat pump water heaters,a relatively new water heater design not previously covered by the testprocedure; second, to add a method of testing to determine the first hourrating of water heaters equipped with thermal compensating dip tubes; andthird, to make modifications to the test procedures that would yield moreaccurate determinations of energy efficiency and cost of operation forgas, oil and electric storage water heaters.By notice published March 16, 1984, DOE, on request of the water heaterindustry, extended the comment period 42 days and rescheduled the March15, 1984, public hearing to April 26, 1984. (49 FR 10071.)In comments received in 1984 and throughout 1985 numerous parties requestedthat DOE withdraw the 1984 proposal and wait until a more comprehensiveproposal could be developed. Most notably, on October 2-3, 1985, DOE andNIST hosted a forum on testing and rating procedures for consumer productswhich was attended by manufacturers, utilities, States, and public interestgroups. At the forum, there was unanimous agreement that DOE should withdrawthe 1984 proposal and initiate the development of a single test proceduremethod which would be applicable to all types of residential type waterheaters, including the instantaneous type of water heaters.By notice published March 13, 1987 (referred to hereafter as the ``March1987 proposal''), DOE proposed a single test procedure for all types ofwater heaters, including instantaneous type water heaters. The March 1987proposal also addressed the matter of four test procedure waivers wherefour manufacturers of water heaters had received allowance to test certainwater heaters under modified test procedures. Since publication of theMarch 1987 proposal, a fifth manufacturer has received a test procedurewaiver. The March 1987 proposal would extend these modifications to allmanufacturers of similar designs and thereby would terminate the five individualwaivers. The five waivers are: A.O. Smith Corporation for its gas waterheaters equipped with thermal compensating dip tubes (47 FR 53942, November30, 1982), and four manufacturers of water heaters with large thermal massdesigns: Bock Water Heaters Inc. (50 FR 47106, November 14, 1985, modified51 FR 21975, June 17, 1986), Ford Products Inc. (50 FR 50678, December11, 1985, modified 51 FR 18659, May 21, 1986), Lochinvar Water Heaters,Inc. (51 FR 22966, June 24, 1986), and Aero Environmental Limited (53 FR9687, March 24, 1988).The major issues covered in the March 1987 proposal included:(1) Extending the test procedure to cover heat pump water heaters and instantaneoustype water heaters;(2) Revising the method of test for all water heaters from a no draw testto 24 hour simulated use test which includes a six-hour draw test; and(3) Revising the first hour rating test from a calculated estimate to adirect measure for determining a water heater's ability to supply hot water.b. Energy Conservation StandardsThe National Appliance Energy Conservation Act of 1987 prescribed energyconservation standards for 11 types of appliances including electric, gas,and oil-fired water heaters. The effective date for water heater standardsis January 1, 1990.NAECA also added a definition for water heaters, as follows: ``The term`water heater' means a product which utilizes oil, gas, or electricityto heat potable water for use outside the heater upon demand, including_(A) Storage type units which heat and store water at a thermostaticallycontrolled temperature, including gas storage water heaters with an inputof 75,000 Btu per hour or less, oil storage water heaters with an inputof 105,000 Btu per hour or less, and electric storage water heaters withan input of 12 kilowatts or less;  (B) Instantaneous type units which heat water but contain no more thanone gallon of water per 4,000 Btu per hour of input, including gas instantaneouswater heaters with an input of 200,000 Btu per hour or less, oil instantaneouswater heaters with an input of 210,000 Btu per hour or less, and electricinstantaneous water heaters with an input of 12 kilowatts or less; and(C) Heat pump type units, with a maximum current rating of 24 amperes ata voltage no greater than 250 volts, which are products designed to transferthermal energy from one temperature level to a higher temperature levelfor the purpose of heating water, including all ancillary equipment suchas fans, storage tanks, pumps, or controls necessary for the device toperform its function.'' Section 323(e) of the Act requires DOE to determine to what extent, ifany, a proposed test procedure would alter the measured efficiency or measuredenergy use of any covered product as determined under the existing testprocedure. Today's proposal satisfies this requirement with respect tothe March 1987 proposal. Furthermore, section 323(e) requires DOE to testa representative sample using the proposed test procedure; today's proposalis based on testing a sample of units in accordance with the March 1987proposal which has been revised based upon the comments received. The revisedtest procedure used to test a sample of water heaters is included in SectionII, Discussion, below. Section 323(e) of the Act also provides that models of covered productsin use before the date on which the amended energy conservation standardbecomes effective (or revisions of such models that come into use aftersuch date and have the same energy efficiency or energy use characteristics)that comply with the energy conservation standard applicable to such coveredproducts on the day before such date shall be deemed to comply with theamended energy conservation standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion</ITAG>a. Standards<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Efficiency Standards Prescribed by NAECA  </ITAG>The NAECA standards, which are based on existing test procedures, are interms of energy factor. These are:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s20,r20</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Energy factor</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">(A) Gas water heater<D>.62^ (.0019andmultiply;Rated storage volume in gallons).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(B) Oil water heater<D>.59^ (.0019andmultiply;Rated storage volume in gallons).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">(C) Electric water heater<D>.95^ (.00132andmultiply;Rated storage volume in gallons).</D></ITAG></ITAG> The second term in these equations, i.e., .0019V and .00132V, accountsfor the effect of tank volume on energy factor. This relationship of energyfactor to tank volume is due to the fact that with a given construction(same insulation, etc.), the energy required to maintain stored water temperatureincreases with increased storage volume. The coefficient for volume used in this relationship, i.e., 0.0019 forgas and oil-fueled water heaters and 0.00132 for electric water heaters,is the slope of the line which relates energy factor to tank volume. Thetest methods in today's notice are not considered to alter the measureof efficiency of water heaters from the existing test procedures. Therefore,DOE proposes to retain the volume relationships in the NAECA standards.Since the data base of test units used in developing these proposed waterheater standards is a total of 14 units, i.e., 7 electric, 5 gas, and 2oil water heaters. DOE requests any additional test data manufacturersmay have and any information manufacturers may have on the effects of tankcapacity on energy factor.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Effects of Proposed Test Procedures on Energy Factors </ITAG>In accordance with the requirements of section 323(e) of the Act, the Departmenthas reviewed the impact amended test procedures will have on the measureof water heater energy efficiency. The following changes to the test procedureshave been reviewed:<ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Simulated use vs. cold start test.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Water temperature rise.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Stored water temperature (thermostat setting).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Room temperature.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Water usage.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">andbullet; Uninsulated pipe fittings.</ITAG>Some of the above changes to the test procedures increase energy factorwhile other changes reduce energy factor. The overall effect is to reducethe energy factor for electric storage water heaters, while the energyfactor for gas and oil fueled storage water heaters is not expected tobe affected by the changes. The test procedure, specified in today's notice_simulated use test_adjustsupward the energy factor for high mass water heaters (such as oil fueledwater heaters) compared to the cold start recovery test. Under cold startconditions of the existing test procedure, some of the energy input isused to heat up the tank (metal and insulation) to the operating temperatureand is therefore not available for heating water. The procedures specifiedin today's notice do not include that condition. Energy factors calculated using the test procedures in today's notice wouldalso be expected to increase due to a reduced assigned temperature differencebetween stored water and room temperature, i.e., reduced from 90 anddegrees;Fin the existing procedures to 67.5 anddegrees;F. With reduced temperature,lower standby loss results. However, the overall effect on energy factor due to reduced stored watertemperature would be neutral due to the reduction in energy output. Thereduced temperature rise of heated water, i.e., from 90 anddegrees;F to 77anddegrees;F, results in less energy output per day, and since energy factordrops as the energy output drops, this lower temperature rise tends toreduce energy factor (approximately two percent for an electric water heater).Another change which is applicable to all water heaters is the use of uninsulatedpipe fittings in these new procedures. This change would increase standbyloss and reduce energy factor. Electric water heaters without heat trapswould be particularly affected since all their energy loss is due to standbyloss. Since no specific energy factors were prescribed spearately for instantaneouswater heaters, DOE believes the standards prescribed in NAECA for waterheaters are also applicable to instantaneous type water heaters. However,the definitions used in today's notice for instantaneous type water heatersinclude only residential types intended to supply the total residentialhot water requirements and exclude commercial types.The only known residential types of instantaneous water heaters are gasfueled, either natural gas or Liquified Petroleum (propane) gas. The energyfactor proposed in today's notice for gas fueled instantaneous water heatersis based on an assigned nominal storage volume of two gallons for all instantaneouswater heaters. Therefore, the second term in the NAECA equations for gaswater heaters, i.e., 0.0019V, is not relevant for instantaneous type waterheaters of two gallons or less. Since the maximum volume of the instantaneouswater heater has been defined here to be no more than two gallons, thisterm has little effect on the energy factor. At the extreme with two gallonsof storage, the calculated result using this second term would be 0.616which the test procedure rounds to 0.62.Electric instantaneous water heaters are considered by DOE to be excludedfrom the program because they are primarily used in industrial and commercialapplications to produce tempered, rather than hot, water and are not consideredto be residential.Oil fueled instantaneous water heaters are not included in the proposedstandards. NAECA's definition of instantaneous type units is for unitsthat contain less than one gallon per 4,000 Btu per hour of input. However,an oil fueled storage water heater of between 80,000 and 105,000 Btu perhour input with a tank capacity of 20 to 26 gallons would fall into thisdefinition of instantaneous water heater. This configuration is more properlycovered as a storage type water heater.Also, there are no specific energy factors for heat pump water heatersspecified in NAECA. Therefore, heat pump water heaters are not includedin these proposed standards. Since heat pump water heaters have an energyfactor greater than 1.0 and energy factors prescribed in NAECA are allless than 1.0, the NAECA standard is considered to apply to conventionalelectric water heaters only. When reviewing the standards for water heatersin 1992, DOE will consider if standards for heat pump water heaters shouldbe proposed.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Test Results</ITAG>Water heaters were selected for test in order to determine to what extent,if any, the test procedures in today's notice would alter the measuredefficiency of water heaters. The approach used to accomplish this was asfollows:Models of the most common water heater sizes in terms of storage capacityfor gas, oil, and electric water heaters were selected. Electric waterheaters with a capacity range of 30 to 82 gallons, and gas water heatersfrom 30 to 50 gallons are estimated to represent approximately 95 percentof all electric and gas water heaters sold. Units selected for test fallwithin this range. Oil fueled water heater selection is limited in termsof storage capacity. DOE believes the most common size oil fueled waterheater has a 32 gallon storage capacity; therefore, this size was chosenfor these tests.The NAECA prescribed minimum conservation standards for selected storagecapacities was calculated. For example, for 40 gallon electric water heatersthe NAECA standard would require an energy factor of 0.90, i.e., EF= 0.95-.00132V;substituting V=40, EF=90. Candidate water heaters were identified by manufacturerand model number using the listings from the January 1987 Consumers Directoryof Certified Water Heater Efficiency Ratings, which are certified and publishedby the Gas Appliance Manufacturers Association (GAMA). Test units selectedfor purchase were those listed in this directory whose rated energy factorminimally complied with the standard.Five gas, six electric and two oil water heaters were purchased for testing.The gas and electric water heaters were tested at the National Instituteof Standards and Technology (NIST), and the oil fueled water heaters weretested at the Electrical Testing Laboratory (ETL) in Cortland, New York.The oil fueled water heaters were not tested at NIST, because NIST didnot have the facilities to test these units. ETL was selected by NIST totest the oil fueled water heaters because of its experience testing theseunits for the GAMA water heater certification program.Tables 1, 2 and 3 show results obtained for electric, gas and oil fueledstorage-type water heaters, and the make and model number of the test units.The column labeled ``Current Procedure'' is the test procedure upon whichNAECA standards were based.Table 1 for electric water heaters shows that test procedures used in today'snotice result in energy factors which are consistently lower than thatobtained with the current test procedure. The average difference is .023.Therefore, the first term of the proposed energy factor equation used intoday's notice has been adjusted downward by .02 in order to account forthis difference. No effect of tank capacity is discernible in the limitedamount of test data shown here. Comments in the form of measured test dataincluding energy factor for various tank capacities is requested.Table 2 for gas water heaters shows there is essentially little or no differenceon average between the current test procedure and the procedure used intoday's notice. Therefore, DOE is not proposing amendments to the energyfactor for gas water heaters as prescribed in NAECA.Table 3 for oil water heaters also shows essentially the same results forthe test procedure used in today's notice versus the current test procedure.Although the simulated use test granted by waivers used three draw cyclesversus six draw cycles in the procedures used in today's notice, the resultsshow no difference when rounded to the second decimal place as shown inTable 3. DOE is proposing not to amend the NAECA standard for oil fueledwater heaters.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C/><T4>Table</T4> 1._<T4>Test Results_Energy Factors for Electric Water Heaters</T4><H1>Test unit\1\</H1><H1>Tank capacity gallons</H1><H2>Rated</H2><H2>Measured</H2><H1>Energy Factor\2\</H1><H2>Test procedure in today's notice</H2><H2>Current test procedure\3\</H2><H2>GAMA directory rating\3\</H2><ITAG tagnum="1">A-1 <D>30 </D><D>27.3 </D><D>0.84 </D><D>0.88 </D><D>0.91 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A-2 <D>52 </D><D>49.0 </D><D>.88 </D><D>.89 </D><D>.89 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A-3 <D>82 </D><D>77.3 </D><D>.77 </D><D>.80 </D><D>.84 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A-4 <D>40 </D><D>36.3 </D><D>.84 </D><D>.85 </D><D>.90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A-5 <D>40 </D><D>36.6 </D><D>.86 </D><D>.88 </D><D>.90 </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A-6 <D>40 </D><D>35.8 </D><D>.82 </D><D>.85 </D><D>.90</D><F>\1\Test units by make and model were as follows:</F></ITAG></ITAG> <ITAG tagnum="110"><C>3,L2,tp0,i1,s150,r150,xs108</C> <H1>Test unit</H1><H1>Manufacturer</H1><H1>Model No.</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">A-1 <D>State Industries Inc </D><D>Censible PV30 1LS1. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A-2 <D>Sears Roebuck andamp; Company </D><D>Survivor Kenmore 625-320520. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A-3 <D>State Industries Inc </D><D>Censible PX821RT1. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A-4 <D>Sears Roebuck andamp; Company </D><D>Economizer (5) 153.313470. </D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">A-5 <D>A.O.

While the units all measuredlower in energy factor under the current test procedure than the GAMA DirectoryRating, DOE does not believe that the results for units that minimallycomply with the standard, based on test, will differ from those DOE found.DOE believes that the differences in test methods will result in a twopoint (0.2) difference (on average) for electric storage water heaters.</F><F>\3\Current test procedure for electric and gas water heaters is thetest procedure in 10 CFR Part 430 Subpart B, Appendix E.

(Bosch, No.69, at 3, and ITS, No. 65, at 2).\2\<NOTE/> These commenters suggested a definition of instantaneouswater heaters that is based on demand and the heating operation is activatedby a flow of water. ITS commented that three National Codes classify aninstantaneous water heater as having one gallon of storage or less. ITSalso commented that electric instantaneous water heaters differ from gaswater heaters of the same type due to the fact that the ``electrics'' areprimarily used to produce tempered water, rather than hot water, for industrialand commercial applications and should not be included within the scopeof this proposed rule. ITS also commented that small point of use electricstorage systems along with small single task gas instantaneous water heatersshould be exempt from DOE regulations. ITS commented that 99 percent ofits mini-storage type water heaters (1.33 gallon) are used in wet barsand in offices, while 99 percent of the electric instantaneous are usedin industrial/commercial applications. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Comments on the rulemaking were given docket numbers.For comments submitted in writing, citations provide the name of the organization,firm or person who made the comment, the docket number assigned to thecomment, and the page on which the comment is found in the commenter'ssubmittal.

The definition of gas fueled instantaneous water heaters in the test proceduresincluded in today's notice includes only water heaters intended to supplythe residential hot water requirements and excludes small special purposecommercial type water heaters. With these exclusions, the typical waterusage rate proposed for storage type household water heaters will alsobe applicable to instantaneous gas type household water heaters.<T3>Hot Water Usage. </T3>The hot water usage proposed in the March 1987proposal included four assigned hot water usage rates. The majority ofwater heaters would have been assigned 60 gallons per day under that proposedprocedure. Thermar Corporation (Thermar) stated that 60 gallons per day should bethe only usage against which all residential heaters be measured. (Thermar,No. 50, at 3). The Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) commented that 60 gallonsper day is excessive for an average family size and suggested that 30 to40 gallons per day is more appropriate. (NRDC, No. 51, at 2-5). In addition,NRDC suggests an alternative table of daily hot water use. The NRDC proposalwould place almost all residential water heaters into either 30 or 45 gallonper day usage categories, and the oil-fired water heaters would all beassigned 45 gallons per day instead of 60 gallons per day as proposed.Bock and GAMA commented that the assigned value for annual usage for oilfueled water heaters should be the first hour rating. (Bock, No. 28, at1, and GAMA, No. 59, at 18).The purpose of the first hour rating was introduced primarily to selecta water heater that would satisfy consumer needs, and secondly as a wayfor comparing water heaters having similar capacity in terms of their abilityto deliver hot water. The selection process of determining a water heatersize that would be needed to supply the peak amount of hot water neededin one hour involves adding up all the hot water uses expected in one hour,or highest expected use, and to purchase water heater having a first hourrating equal to or close to this estimated maximum demand. DOE does notconsider the total amount of hot water that would be used in a day to beequivalent to this maximum one hour demand period, i.e., first hour rating,as proposing by Bock and GAMA.The March 1987 proposal included broad groupings of first hour ratings(in 20 gallon increments) for an assigned value of daily hot water usage.The proposal grouped most of the typical residential water heaters withinthe 60 gallon per day usage group. If the GAMA and Bock recommendationswere to be adopted, i.e., one gallon increments, every water heater witha different first hour rating would be rated on a different hot water usagebasis and labeled annual cost for water heaters would differ due to differentwater usage rates. To assign the total amount of hot water that would beused in a day to be equal to the maximum one hour demand period, i.e.,first hour rating, has no basis. No field test data has been supplied bycommenters to substantiate their proposal. Any relationship between peakhourly use and average daily use is unknown.DOE considers that Bock and GAMA's proposed assigned values of daily hotwater use based on the water heaters first hour rating is also inappropriatefor these additional reasons:(i) The instantaneous water heater is capable of supplying typically twogallons per minute of hot water or 120 gallons per hour. It would be misleadingto assign this number of gallons per day to a typical instantaneous waterheater since daily water usage cannot be directly related to a water heater'sability to supply short term hot water.(ii) Large electric storage tank water heaters may be used as offpeak powercontrolled type, and would typically be an 80 gallon tank with a 100 gallonfirst hour rating. These water heaters would not typically use 100 gallonsper day, and their first hour rating would be misleading as a measure ofdaily usage since a water heater capacity is sized to meet peak needs andnot according to daily usage.The national average use of hot water in 1975 was determined to be 450gallons per week as a result of metered field test data and is the basisof the current test procedure assignment of 64.3 gallons per day for atypical family of four. A more recent reanalysis by NIST of the daily hotwater use has confirmed this amount (NBSIR 853220 ``A Review of EnergyUse Factors for Selected Household Appliances''), and recommended 60 gallonsper day as a national average daily usage rate. Furthermore, a NIST/DOEAppliance Forum held at NIST in 1985 concluded that various utility studiestend to confirm a figure in the range of the presently set value of 64gallons per day. The forum also concluded that any minor adjustment, i.e.,60 gallons per day, would have little merit. Therefore, DOE has concludedthat one typical average value of hot water use, the currently assignedvalue of 64.3 gallons per day, remains appropriate for labeling the averageannual cost for all household water heaters. Also, the calculation of energyfactor is based on this assigned average usage value of 64.3 gallons perday.<T3>First Hour Rating.</T3> Maus Technologies (Maus) commented that therehas been a strong emphasis in the water heater industry on designing electricwater heaters by maximizing the capabilities of available heat as hot waterdelivered. (Maus, No. 60, at 2.) DOE understands this comment to mean thatfor a given amount of energy input more hot water would be available foruse. Maus contends that the increased capability of the double elementwater heater does not show up in a comparison with a single element electricwater heater under the proposed procedure. By assigning all electric waterheaters with their rated recovery rate, the March 1987 proposal assumedall input energy to be available as hot water during the balance of thehour after the initial draw was completed. Maus contends that only a portionof the power input to the tank during the heating of water will be availableas usable hot water during the one hour test period unless the water heateris of a special design. Maus commented that Mor Flow Industries, a manufacturerof water heaters, is about to introduce a special design of storage typewater heater which will actually deliver the performance that would beattributed by the proposed first hour rating test to all water heaters.Maus contends that its improved water heater design will not be properlyrecognized since the March 1987 proposed procedure would allow a conventionalwater heater to be biased with a high rating. Maus recommends modificaitonof the test procedure to maintain power to the heater throughout the testperiod. Furthermore, Maus recommends that instead of calculating the amountof additional hot water produced, water heaters be tested to measure theamount of hot water delivered. Maus also contends its recommendations willallow consumers to properly ``size'' in selecting a smaller water heatertank volume, which because of the special design would make available asmuch hot water as a larger tank. This would allow for an energy savingsdue to the inherently lower standby energy with a smaller tank.The March 1987 proposal terminated the draw when the outlet water temperaturedrops 20 anddegrees;F below the initial temperature. Thermorise Company (Thermorise),a developer of a new electric water heater design, commented that the firsthour rating test should be terminated when the outlet temperature reaches105 anddegrees;F independent of the starting temperature. (Thermorise, No.55, at 1 and 2). Thermorise proposes that the heating element or the burnerbe energized during the first hour test since this will be the case underoperating conditions in the field. Thermorise also proposed a specificadjustment to the flow rate and draw schedule for electric water heaters.Thermorise contends that the gas and oil-fired water heaters are practicallyimmune to flow rate while the electrics are affected due to their lowerrecovery rate, with power input limitation, due to house wiring at about5000 watts. The draw schedule Thermorise proposes varies from 1.5 gallonsper minute (gpm) for the smallest electric water heaters (20 gallons) to3 gpm with larger tanks (about 80 gallons).GAMA suggested an alternative draw test that would be an hour long whichwould determine the amount of hot water provided in that period. (GAMA,No. 59, at 7).NIST concurs with GAMA, Thermorise and Maus in their recommendations thata full one hour draw test be performed. In response to these comments,NIST recommended a revised test procedure for first hour rating. That revisedprocedure, included in today's notice, consists of allowing the power tothe water heater to remain on during the complete test and applying additionaldraws following the initial draw whenever the thermostat cuts out duringthe one hour test. At the end of one hour, any water remaining in the tankwhich is above a threshold floor temperature is drawn from the tank andcredited for the first hour rating. The floor temperature for terminatingthe draw is assigned a value for testing purposes of 25 degrees below themaximum temperature of water drawn. An adjustment of the number of gallonsof the water drawn to account for the average temperature of water drawnis calculated in order to express the results as an equivalent volume atthe maximum temperature (nominally 135 anddegrees;F).Thermorise stated that a uniform draw rate of 5 gallons per minute forall water heaters does not seem appropriate and the rate should be 2.5gallons per minute for heaters rated 50 gallons or less. NIST recommendedthat test procedures be kept as similar as possible for all water heaters.The separate draw schedule proposed by Thermorise has not been accepted.DOE has concluded that a draw rate of three gallons per minute is appropriate,and the draw rate is being revised to three gallons per minute for storagetype water heaters.Thermorise recommended a calculation procedure to adjust the amount ofwater drawn to an equivalent number of gallons at a temperature of 135anddegrees;F. (Thermorise, No. 26, at 1-7, No. 70, at 1-3, and No. 73, at1-4). The adjustment factor proposed by Thermorise is (Tom-(To-Td)/Td),where To is the maximum temperature of the drawn water and Tom is the meantemperature of the drawn water, and Td is the temperature drop from themaximum to the floor temperature. Thermorise proposed that no credit wouldbe given for the water drawn until it is heated above the floor temperature(nominally 110 anddegrees;F or 25 anddegrees;F below the maximum 135 anddegrees;F).The March 1987 proposal for correcting the water volume used the inlettemperature of 58 anddegrees;F as the reference point for correction, fora drop of 77 anddegrees;F. In other words, credit was given for heating thewater from 58 anddegrees;F. Thermorise subsequently withdrew its recommended25 anddegrees;F drop, in favor of the 77 anddegrees;F drop. (Thermorise, No.73, at 1).NIST has determined that the form of the proposed adjustment equation recommendedby Thermorise offers an improvement over the March 1987 proposal. Becausethe allowed variation of thermostat setting for maximum temperature is135anddegrees; andplusmin; 5anddegrees;, there could be a slight variation infirst hour ratings due to the differences in thermostat setting from oneunit to the next. The Thermorise proposed adjustment factor eliminatessuch differences since the correction factor results in exactly the samevalue irrespective of fluctuations in the thermostat setting. This is dueto the use of an assigned temperature drop in both the numerator and denominatorof the equation. The temperature drop is being assigned in these proceduresas 77 anddegrees;F (maximum of 135 anddegrees;F less the inlet of 58 anddegrees;Fequals 77 anddegrees;F). The adjustment factor prescribed here is (Tom-(To-77)/77).Several manufacturers and representatives of instantaneous water heatermanufactures commented concerning the proposed normalizing of first hourrating using a five gallons per minute adjustment factor in the calculation.The March 1987 proposal included adjustment of the first hour rating bya factor proportional to what would be supplied if the tested draw werethe same as used for storage type water heaters (five gallons per minute).That adjustment would reduce the first hour rating by 50 percent for thetypical instantaneous water heaters.The Controlled Energy Corporation (CE), The Carson Agency (CA), Thermar,ITS, GAMA and Bosch state that the 5 gallons per minute flow rate specifiedis excessive and should be reduced to 3 gallons per minute. (ITS, No. 65,at 1-2, CA, No. 56, at 1; CE, No. 62, at 1; Thermar, No. 5, at 3 and BoschNo. 69, at 5 and 6). The commenters believe that the first hour recoveryfactor should be equal to the number of gallons of water delivered in anhour with temperature raised 77 anddegrees;F without adjustment to a 5 gpmrate as proposed by DOE. CE states that the first hour recovery shouldbe based on the amount of hot water provided at a given temperature. Boschand ITs also noted that 64.3 gallons per day, the assumed daily usage ofhot water in the current test procedure, is in contradiction with the adjustmentfactor used in the March 1987 proposal. Bosch also states that its customersare satisfied with a lower flow rate and will accept reduced flow for largerperiods. Bosch also states its customers tend to be customers who havelarge hot water demands, such as large families who might require 4, 5,or 6 consecutive showers in the morning or evening.DOE agrees that the first hour rating as a measure of utility may be betterbased upon a method and procedures which are consistent with usage of theproduct. DOE agrees with commenters that the first hour rating be the amountof hot water the water heater is able to deliver in one hour of continuousdraw at a 77 anddegrees;F temperature rise. Test procedures that are includedin today's notice are based on the measured amount of drawn hot water provided,without adjustment for flow rate.<T3>Draw Schedule. </T3>Thermorise comments that the six draw schedulebe revised to two draws for electric water heaters, one to represent thetotal morning use and one to represent the total evening use. (Thermorise,No. 55, at 2). Thermorise comments this would reduce testing time, andalthough it may not be representative of the actual use, would be warrantedgiven the fact that heat transfer in an electric water heater is about100 percent and recovery efficiency (which is being determined by drawschedule test) would not be any more accurate with a more detailed drawschedule. Thermar proposed that draw be terminated when the outlet watertemperature reaches 105 anddegrees;F. Thermar commented that the draw schedulefor average residential use is not 6 equal 10-gallon draws, but is onemajor draw consuming perhaps 66 percent of the proposed 60 gallons andas many as 5 smaller draws consuming the balance. (Thermar, No. 50, at3).The draw schedules proposed by Thermar and Thermorise would result in areduced storage tank temperature after the initial large draw. Consequently,the tank being practically filled with cold water would have a considerablylower standby loss.This initial large draw would result in a reduced standby energy use inconsistentwith typical use in the home, and is estimated (by calculation using anassigned typical water heater design for standby loss) to result in increaseof the energy factor by approximately 2 percent. Thermar's contention thattwo-thirds of all water drawn is drawn during one major draw is not consistentwith field test data published by NIST, and the American Society of HeatingRefrigerating and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) in conjunction withfield testing by Ontario Hydro. The ASHRAE-Ontario Hydro Report shows,at the 95 percent confidence level, that the maximum hourly use was approximately12 gallons, or 20 percent of the daily hot water use. In results reportedfor ``selected high morning users,'' the maximum use over one hour was25 percent of the total daily use. DOE rejects the suggestion that the draw schedule be reduced, based ona review of the comments. The six equal draws are being retained for allwater heaters. <T3>Simulated Use Test. </T3>In the March 1987 proposal, recovery efficiencywas included for two purposes: (1) To adjust the daily water heater energyconsumed in order to account for differences in the water temperature,i.e., energy content of a storage tank at the end of test as compared withthe starting condition; and (2) to calculate the first hour rating. Theproposed method of test for recovery efficiency was the ratio of outputenergy to input energy over a six hour test, which included six intermittentdraws spaced one hour apart.GAMA commented that all six of the draws should be conducted with eachsuccessive draw beginning as soon as thermal equilibrium has been attainedas a result of recovery from the previous draw. (GAMA, No. 59, at 6). GAMAcontends that the computation of recovery efficiency from the proposedtest procedure is not consistent with the current recovery efficiency sincethe energy measured during the first six hours of the test includes severalminutes of standby energy lost between each draw. For water heaters withsignificant standby losses and low recovery efficiencies, use of the currentprocedure will result in a significant error, according to GAMA.Comments also were received suggesting that recovery efficiency be retainedin its current form. The California Energy Commission (CEC) requests thatrecovery efficiency and standby loss be maintained as clear componentsof the test method since these values are both used in a proposed ASHRAEStandard test method (SPC-124P) for combined space/water heating appliancesand CEC documents. (CEC, No. 57, at 1).Book commented that separate thermal efficiencies and standby loss calculationsbe retained, since they may be useful in predicting performance of a waterheater in applications different from the test conditions used in the March1987 proposal and in today's notice. (Bock, No. 28, at 2).NIST investigated the GAMA proposal as well as other approaches to adjustingrecovery efficiency so that standby energy would not be included in thesix hour draw test period. As a result of these tests, NIST recommendedthat recovery efficiency for gas, oil and heat pump water heaters be measuredduring the first draw of the six draw test. In this test, any differencein the tank energy content between the start and end of the first drawis accounted for. DOE has concluded that since the recovery efficiencyof electric water heaters with immersed heating elements is near 100 percent(less jacket and pipe fitting losses), electric water heaters should beassigned a recovery efficiency of 98 percent. This is consistent with theassignment of 98 percent in the current test procedures. The procedures included in today's notice require a test for recovery efficiencybe run at both maximum and reduced fuel input rates if the water heateris equipped with a control device which provides for burner input modulation.These procedures specify that the six water draws be run with the burneroperating at maximum input. Since the March 1987 proposal, NIST has reportedtest results for several makes of instantaneous water heaters (NBSIR 87-3537,May 1987). The NIST tests show recovery efficiency to be dependent uponflow rate of water drawn. Flow rate affects burner input rate which affectsthe steady-state combustion efficiency because, with atmospheric type burnersoperating at a reduced burner firing rate, an increase of excess combustionair results. Combustion efficiency is at its maximum at the maximum inputrate and falls off at reduced burner firing rates.In tests results reported by NIST, recovery efficiency fell by up to sixpercentage points with reduced fuel input rates when water flow rates werereduced.There can be any number of water flow rates from the minimum (\1/2\ gpmapproximately) which initiates burner operation to four gpm. The maximumis determined by ability of the water heater to produce usable hot water.In order to prescribe a test which will reflect all potential burner inputrates, the test procedures in today's notice, for units which modulategas flow, prescribe that three of the six water draws be run with the burneroperating at maximum input and three draws (four, five and six) be at theminimum input. The water flow rate specified for the maximum input is whateveris needed to achieve a temperature rise of 77 anddegrees;F. Water flow ratefor the reduced firing rate is specified as that flow that maintains burneroperation at the minimum fuel input. Total time of operation at reducedinput rate is adjusted in order that one half of the daily output energyis produced with the burner operating at reduced (minimum) input rate.Average recovery efficiency for modulating type burners is calculated asthe average energy output to input energy for draws No. 1, run at maximumfuel input, and No. 4, run at minimum fuel input.Both Thermar and ITS commented that instantaneous water heaters do notresult in standby loss since there is no storage; therefore, the test procedureproposed for recovery efficiency and the need to monitor room temperatureis not needed. (ITS, No. 65, at 3, Thermar, No. 50, at 4).NIST has recommended in its analysis of comments that the six draw testprocedure and the 18 hour standby period should be retained for instantaneouswater heaters so that testing of all water heaters is performed under thesame set of conditions.Both ITS and Thermar contend that for testing water heaters all that isreally necessary to determine efficiency is a thermocouple to record incomingand discharge water temperatures along with meters to measure energy consumed.This would mean only recovery efficiency would be used as a measure ofenergy efficiency ratio.DOE rejects the simplified single draw test or steady-state test. Witha single draw the energy stored in the heat exchanger is lost during burneroff periods. In a single draw or steady-state test, these cyclic lossesare not accounted for. Also, the intermittent draw is more representativeof how the water heater is actually used.The difference between energy factor for 24-hour simulated use test andrecovery efficiency for a single draw is considerable. NIST reported, NBSIR87-3537 ``Performance of Instantaneous Water Heaters,'' May 1987, energyfactors of between 10 and 24 percentage points lower than recovery efficiencyat 64.3 gallons per day. The greatest difference between the four waterheaters tested was for one having the highest pilot input rate, i.e., 896Btu/hr. In other words, pilot input rate is expected to be an importantfactor in meeting the energy factor specified in NAECA and proposed todayfor gas fueled instantaneous water heaters.A standby test of 18 hours prescribed in these procedures will reflectonly the pilot loss, since there is practically no stored water by definitionfor this type heater. Although instantaneous water heaters may be equippedwith a valve to shut-off the pilot and a manual start-up ignition source(such as a piezoelectric spark ignitor), procedures in today's notice arebased upon full use of the pilot energy in the simulated use test and requirethe pilot to remain in operation. Standby loss could be measured in a shorterperiod of time for instantaneous type water heaters. GAMA, in its comments,suggests that the standby test may be terminated after one hour and calculatedfor the daily energy use by multiplying the total hours for the daily standbyperiod by that hourly loss.GAMA also comments that the standby loss as a measure of water heater performanceshould be deleted from the test procedure since the term is not used ordetermined. (GAMA, No. 54, at 19 and 28). CEC asks that the standby lossdescription be expanded to describe how to calculate standby loss, and``that it be retained as a clear component of the test method so that itmay be used for other applications such as ASHRAE standards.'' (CEC, No.57, at 1).The test procedure included in today's notice provides details on how tocalculate standby loss. The current DOE test procedures define standbyloss as a percent per hour term from which the actual loss as Btu per hourcould be calculated. Test procedures in today's notice express standbyloss directly as the ``Hourly Standby Loss'' in Btus per hour. See Section6.2.4 of today's notice under the ``Amended Test Procedure'' (section 2below). In order to maintain a consistent procedure for all types of waterheaters, the entire 24-hour simulated use test is being retained.<T3>Correction of Measured Energy to Reference Temperature Conditions.</T3>The March 1987 proposal allowed temperature ranges for room air temperatureof 65-70 anddegrees;F, thermostat setting (average tank temperature at thermostatcut out) of 135andplusmin;5 anddegrees;F and inlet water of 58 anddegrees;F andplusmin;2anddegrees;F. At the extremes of these conditions, with the most favorablebeing the lowest temperature differences between stored water and roomtemperature, i.e., 60 anddegrees;F, (130 anddegrees;F less 70 anddegrees;F),and the least favorable, 75 anddegrees;F, (140 anddegrees;F less 65 anddegrees;F),the standby energy effects alone would mean typical energy use variationof from 68,133 to 79,585 Btus per day, respectively. Energy factor wouldalso be affected at these extremes. These conditions assume the inlet watertermperature is held at 58 anddegrees;F. The added tolerance of andplusmin;2anddegrees;F on inlet water would extend maximum energy use to 80,868 Btusper day with inlet water of 56 anddegrees;F.Procedures prescribed here now include an adjustment of the measured recoveryenergy use to the required conditions of a 77 anddegrees;F temperature riseof the heated water (135 anddegrees;Fandplusmin; 58 anddegrees;F). Also, thestandby energy use is adjusted from average measured temperature drop betweenthe stored water and test room to a required difference of 67.5 anddegrees;F(135 anddegrees;F andplusmin; anddegrees;F67.5 anddegrees;F). The mid point ofthe allowable room temperature range of 65 to 70 is 67.5 anddegrees;F. Thesechanges for correcting to reference conditions are expected to correctin part problems of repeatability of test results raised by Ecodyne inits comment, as detailed below.<T3>Repeatability of Test Results.</T3> Ecodyne commented that the widevariability of the tolerances for thermostat settings, room temperatureand inlet water temperature will not allow for repeatability in testing.(Ecodyne, No. 63, at 4.) Ecodyne claims its test results with the sameunit in six tests varied from an energy factor of 0.83 to 0.92. Ecodynebelieves that the existing test procedures give more repeatable resultsand should be retained.Ecodyne commented that its plastic electric storage water heaters, withbuilt-in thermal mass, has more material to store heat than a conventionalmetal tank. Ecodyne claims that it can take 24 hours or more to balanceheat flows and suggested that an option be provided to cycle a unit fora period for stabilization before the test is run.NIST tested an Ecodyne manufactured plastic electric storage water heaterand found no significant difference in energy factor between a test runwithout pre-conditioning, with the tank filled and with power on the thermostatadjusted. Although pre-conditioning of the tank was intended for high massoil fueled water heaters, it has been included for any water heater ifthat will improve repeatablity of test results. Ecodyne also commented that repeatability can be affected by air movementin the laboratory particularly with the exposed piping specified in theMarch 1987 proposed procedure. (Ecodyne, No. 63, at 2). NBS has checked repeatability of test results by these prescribed proceduresand has determined that results are repeatable. However, a caution statementhas been added to the procedures in today's notice concerning protectingagainst drafts in the test area. <T3>Ratings for Untested Models. </T3>Rheem Manufacturing Company (Rheem)proposed a calculation method to avoid the cost of testing each electricwater heater having identical construction and tank capacity with the onlydifference being electric wattage of the immersed heating element. (Rheem,No. 71, at 1). Rheem proposes the value for first hour rating and energyfactor be determined for one particular input rating (wattage) as the standardinput, and these test results be assigned for all available inputs of thatsame tank design. As an example of the additional testing required, Rheemclaims that a single series in its double element product includes 40 combinationsof elements and that the most popular combination, 4.5 Kw elements, accountedfor 85.62% of these sales. Since there are eleven different tank sizesin this series varying from 30 to 120 gallons, Rheem claims 440 tests wouldbe required for rating just this one series. In response to this comment, the test procedure included in today's noticespecifies that, in lieu of testing, those water heaters having power inputless than the manufacturer's designated standard input, may be assigned,as the first hour rating, the number of gallons removed from the tank inthe first draw of the first hour rating test. Also, in lieu of testing,water heaters with power inputs greater than the standard input rating,the first hour rating determined for the standard input may be used. Similarly, energy factor for the identical electric storage type waterheater with the exception of heating element wattage may be assigned resultsfor the standard water heater, i.e., standard input rating. Since insulationof a specific electric water heater design is all that determines the energyloss, the assignment of the energy factor to an identically constructedwater heater would be technically correct. <T3>Piping Inlet and Outlet Configuration. </T3>Ecodyne states that theheat loss from pipes should not be included when a water heater is tested.(Ecodyne, No. 63, at 2). Ecodyne claims that the issue of piping shouldnot be reflected in the performance of a water heater. GAMA recommended that the instructions on piping connections be revisedto specify an arrangement of galvanized piping connections which includestwo vertical runs of at least 12 inches, a lateral run and several elbows.(GAMA, No. 59, at 11). GAMA recommends the use of galvanized pipe ratherthan copper tubing since galvanized pipe can be screwed directly on toand off of the water heater's water connections since all water heatershave threated water connections. The configuration suggested by GAMA runsthe water through two 90 anddegrees;F turns before a temperature measurementis taken. The additional bends serve to mix the water and provide a moreaccurate temperature measurement. The NRDC states that the testing of water heaters with DOE proposed pipingconfiguration represents a more accurate procedure for crediting heat trapsthan the system provided in the current regulations. (NRDC, No. 51, at8). The piping configuration advocated by GAMA essentially forms an externalheat trap on both the inlet and outlet of the water heater which wouldtend to reduce thermal losses. Also, the use of galvanized piping is nottypical in actual hot water installations and could affect test procedureresults. NIST, however, advocates the use of unions which will facilitatethe installation and removal of the copper water heater piping and proposesan arrangement which would insure adequate mixing of the fluid streams.DOE has determined that test procedures concerning piping configurationand test set up as provided in the March 1987 proposal are appropriate.<T3>Temperature Measurement of Stored Water. </T3>Ecodyne comments thatits company experiences difficulty installing the thermocouple probe formeasuring the water temperature within the storage tank. One tank whichEcodyne produces is all plastic and does not have an anode rod and relatedopening. The temperature and pressure relief valve opening is located abovethe heating element which prevents insertion of the probe at this location.The cold water inlet cannot be utilized because of the dip tube. Thus,Ecodyne contends, only the hot water outlet may be used and in so doingan extra T-fitting and elbow are required which adds extra mass and heattransfer surface area. Ecodyne further states that on units supplied withheat traps, the heat trap must be moved, necessitating additional fittingswhich result in unrealistic test results. (Ecodyne, No. 65, at 2). FordProducts Corporation (Ford) also expressed concerns regarding the use ofthe thermocouple probe at the public hearing on the proposed test proceduresfor water heaters. (Ford, April 23, 1987, at 90). GAMA recommended thatthe installation procedure for the thermocouple probe be modified to recognizethat some storage tanks may not accommodate six thermocouples or have anaccessible protective anode in which the probe may be inserted. (GAMA,No. 59, at 4). DOE agrees with these comments and has changed the testprocedures to reflect them. <T3>Ambient Air Temperature Measurements. </T3>ITS, CE and Thermar statethat ambient air temperature is not relevant in the testing of instantaneouswater heaters and should not be required. (ITS, No. 65, at 4, Thermar,No. 50, at 3, CE, No. 62, at 2). CE and ITS commented that requiring themeasurement of ambient temperature would cause undue hardship and may forceseveral small companies to abandon their efforts. DOE believes the ambient air temperature surrounding an instantaneous waterheater will affect the performance of the water heater based upon the designof the water heater. For example, an instantaneous water heater with alarge heat transfer surface area, tested with a surrounding ambient temperatureof 100 anddegrees;F, would be given an advantage over a unit of similar designtested with an ambient temperature of 65 anddegrees;F. DOE acknowledges thatfor units currently on the market the effect of ambient temperature wouldbe minimal, but believes that a uniform ambient temperature should be imposedfor the testing of all water heaters and this temperature should be recordedand reported. DOE does not concur with the commenters that measurementof ambient temperature forces an undue hardship on the manufacturers ofinstantaneous water heaters, since the measurement of ambient air temperaturecan be easily performed with a relatively inexpensive thermometer havingan accuracy of andplusmin;1 anddegrees;F.<T3>Flue and Vent Pipe Installation. </T3>GAMA recommended changes concerningthe flue requirements for gas- and oil-fired water heaters. (GAMA, No.55, at 9, 10 and 12). Specifically, GAMA suggested the following installationrequirements: For gas-fired water heaters having a vertically discharging draft hoodoutlet, a five foot vertical vent pipe extension having a diameter equalto the largest flue collar size of the draft hood shall be connected tothe draft hood outlet. For gas-fired water heaters having a horizontally discharging draft hoodoutlet, a 90 degree elbow having a diameter equal to the largest flue collarsize of the draft hood shall be connected to the draft hood outlet. A fivefoot length of vent pipe shall be connected to the elbow and oriented todischarge vertically upward. Perform all tests with the natural draft establishedby this length of vent pipe. A water heater equipped with a mechanical draft system shall be installedwith the mechanical draft system in accordance with the manufacturer'sinstructions using the minimum vertical and horizontal lengths of ventpipe recommended by the manufacturer. For an oil-fired water heater, establish a draft at the flue collar asrecommended in the manufacturer's installation instructions. Establishthe draft for oil-fired water heaters with a vertically discharging draftoutlet by using a sufficient length of vent pipe connected to the waterheater flue outlet and directed vertically upward. For an oil-fired water heater having a horizontally discharging draft hoodoutlet, a 90 degree elbow having a diameter equal to the largest flue collarsize of the draft hood shall be connected to the draft hood outlet. A lengthof vent pipe sufficient to establish the draft shall be connected to theelbow fitting and oriented to discharge vertically upward. Direct ventoil-fired water heaters should be installed with venting equipment as specifiedin the manufacturer's instructions. DOE has adopted GAMA's recommendations in their entirety for oil and gaswater heater vent requirements specified in today's notice. <T3>Water Supply Pressure. </T3>GAMA recommended that the specificationdealing with supply water pressure be modified such that the water pressureneed not be maintained between 40 psig and the maximum pressure specifiedby the manufacturer when water is being removed from the storage tank.(GAMA, No. 59, at 4). DOE agrees with this GAMA recommendation. The following water pressurerequirement is contained within these prescribed test procedures: Duringthe test when water is not being withdrawn, the supply pressure shall bemaintained between 40 psig and the maximum allowable pressure specifiedby the water heater manufacturer. <T3>Implementation and Timing. </T3>Thermar and CE request that at leasttwo years elapse between the formulation of a final test procedure andimplementation of the procedure. (Thermar, No. 50, at 4, and CE, No. 62,at 2). GAMA states that additional time is needed to evaluate the proposedrevised test procedure, determine the transition of the Federal minimumefficiency requirements to reflect the revised test procedure, and to conducttests to determine the new ratings of existing water heater models. (GAMA,No. 59, at 2). GAMA requests an interim rule, which in GAMA's opinion,would allow for a proper determination of the amendment to the Federalminimum standards and allow some relief from the burden imposed by thecombination of new test procedures and Federal minimum conservation requirements.DOE believes this proposed rule, which includes the revised test procedure,should satisfy these comments. <T3>Off-Peak Water Heaters. </T3>A number of comments \3\<NOTE/> were received by DOE concerning ``off-peak'' water heaters.Ohio Power Company states that the inclusion of off-peak storage waterheaters in the DOE testing procedures would be most welcomed. This utilitybelieves that the widespread use of off-peak storage water heating is anefficient and cost-effective means of reducing growth in coincident peakdemand, thereby delaying the need to construct new generating capacity.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The following companies submitted comments supportingthe development of specific test procedures for off-peak water heaters:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,p6,7/8,i1,s25,xs40 </C> <H1>Commenter</H1><H1>Number</H1> <ITAG tagnum="1">Robert E.

Iturges DOE to find a way to test and rate this special design in a mannerthat gives the customer a fair comparison of its advantages. New England Power Service comments that off-peak water heating is an integralpart of the Load Management and Energy Conservation Program. Thus, it urgesDOE to develop and implement tests designed to illustrate the energy conservationadvantages of ``off-peak'' storage-type electric water heaters. Bozrah Light and Power Company also contends that off-peak water heatingis a necessary part of its energy management program. It urges DOE to finda way to test and rate this special design in a manner that gives the customera fair comparison of its advantages. Kingsport Power Company comments that due to the benefits to both the customerand utility, it has implemented a rate incentive which provides a lowerenergy cost where an ``off-peak'' water heater is installed and operatedduring off-peak periods. Kingsport Power Company contends that ``off-peak''storage water heaters require specific testing methods. Once the appropriatetest methods are developed, Kingsport Power Company believe they will verifythe benefits of ``off-peak'' water heating. Public Service Electric and Gas Company recommends that strong considerationbe given to determining a method to rate ``off-peak'' water heaters inorder to afford customers the opportunity to obtain a fair comparison ofthe advantages of off-peak water heating. Columbus Southern feels that specific testing of ``off-peak'' storage typeelectric water heaters is both warranted and desired. Columbus Southerncites ETL test results for ``off-peak storage type electric water heaters,''which exhibited a marked improvement in energy factor over the same waterheaters tested using the current DOE test procedures. Columbus Southernbelieves that efficiency test procedures should exist for significant energyuse concepts such as off-peak storage water heating. Kentucky Power Company believes that DOE's consideration of specific testingfor ``off-peak'' storage type water heaters is a definite step in the rightdirection. Kentucky Power, like Kingsport Power Company, has implementeda rate incentive which provides a lower energy cost to the customer forhot water heating. The company believes that ``off-peak'' water heatersrequire specific testing methods, and once the appropriate methods aredeveloped, they will verify the benefits of this unique method of waterheating.The Indiana and Michigan Electric Company (Indiana and Michigan) believesthat the implementation of test procedures for ``off-peak'' storage typeelectric water heaters would prove quite beneficial. This utility believesthat the present DOE test procedure does not compensate for the reductionin standby losses due to night time deactivation and temperature setback.Indiana and Michigan contends that off-peak electric water heating playsa vital role in its commitment towards time of day rates. It believes thatmeasures of energy consumption for these controlled water heaters wouldhelp improve and standardize the design of large capacity and time differentiatedstorage type electric water heaters.Edison Electric Institute agrees with DOE that the test methods developedfor ``off-peak'' water heaters should be restricted to electric water heaters.Edison points out that more than 100 electric utilities have programs forelectric water heater control, and many others are investigating the institutionof similar programs. Edison concludes by stating that there is a desirefor better information on technological aspects of water heaters, and DOEtest procedures for ``off-peak'' water heaters would be a welcome additionto these efforts.Vaughn Corporation notes that there are two test procedure areas whichwill have to be considered, standby loss and first hour rating, in orderfor controlled water heaters to be integrated into the DOE water heatertest procedure.Vaughn states in its Hearing Testimony attachments that controlled waterheating has been in use for more than sixty years, (Vaughn, Apr 23, 108).Vaughn believes there are three areas that benefit from controlled waterheating:(1) Public policy is served because less energy is consumed to providea service that is essential in every home.(2) Electric utility energy management is served by reducing peak requirementsand also by transferring that requirement to the period of least demandwhere resources may be under utilized.(3) The consumer is served through having a high quality service at a lowerprice.Due to the numerous comments on this topic, NIST and DOE plan to explorevarious concepts for testing ``off-peak'' electric storage type water heaters.DOE expects to propose a rulemaking for controlled water heaters upon completionof the NIST study.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. Amended Test Procedure</ITAG>DOE is setting forth an amended test procedure which incorporates changesmade to the March 1987 proposal and which was used to determine the proposedstandards in today's notice.The water heater test procedures in today's notice will be made final atthe same time the standard levels are made final for water heaters.

Environmental Impact, Regulatory Impact, Regulatory Flexibility,Federalism and Takings Assessment Reviews</ITAG>a. Environmental ReviewPursuant to Section 7(c)(2) of the Federal Energy Administration Act of1974, a copy of this notice has been submitted to the Administrator ofthe Environmental Protection Agency for his comments concerning the impactof this proposal on the quality of the environment.The Department is proposing to amend energy conservation standards forwater heaters in accordance with amendments to test procedures for waterheaters.The Department believes the proposed revision would not be environmentallysignificant since it will not result in any environmental impacts.For applications seeking a temporary small business exemption as well asfor all petitions seeking exemption from Federal standards or supersessionof State standards, DOE will conduct an appropriate National EnvironmentalPolicy Act (NEPA) review on a case-by-case basis.The Department believes that the proposed action would not be a major Federalaction significantly affecting the quality of the human environment withinthe meaning of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, and thatneither an Environmental Impact Statement nor an Environmental Assessmentis required for the propose rule.b. Regulatory Impact ReviewDOE has concluded that the rule is not a ``major rule'' for purpose ofExecutive Order 12291 because it will not result in (1) an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; (2) a major increase in costs orprices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State or local governmentagencies, or geographic government agencies, or geographic regions; or(3) significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This conclusion is based on two factors. First, this proposed standardis only transposing the existing NAECA standard levels due to test proceduremodifcations. Second, the costs of complying with the testing requirementson which the proposed rule is based are not significant. For example, therewould be no additional testing costs dealing with water heaters. Instead,testing cost may decrease since the new test procedures reduce the testtime from a 48-hour test to a 24-hour test.c. Regulatory Flexibility ReviewThe Regulatory Flexibility Act, Pub. L. 96-354 (5 U.S.C. 601-612), requiresthat an agency prepare an initial regulatory flexibility analysis to bepublished at the time the proposed rule is published. This requirement(which appears in section 603) does not apply if the agency ``certifiesthat the rule will not, if promulgated, have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities.'' The proposed rule affectsmanufacturers of water heaters. Since the proposed rule does not affectthe stringency of the water heater standards prescribed by NAECA, DOE believesthat this rule would not have an affect on water heater manufacturers,including small manufacturers. Therefore, DOE certifies that the proposedrules, if promulgated, would not have a ``significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities.''d. Federalism ReviewExecutive Order 12612 (52 FR 41685, October 30, 1987) requires that regulationsor rules be reviewed for any substantial direct effects on States, on therelationship between the National Government and States, or on the distributionof power and responsibilities among various levels of government. If thereare sufficient substantial direct effects, then Executive Order 12612 requirespreparation of a federalism assessment to be used in all decisions involvedin promulgating and implementing a regulation or a rule.DOE has identified a substantial direct effect that today's regulation,when finalized, would have on State governments. It would initially preemptinconsistent State regulations. However, DOE has concluded that the initiallypreemptive effect is not sufficient to warrant preparation of a federalismassessment for two reasons. First, DOE does not have discretion under theAct to avoid promulgating a preemptive regulation because of a policy preferencefor State regulation as a general matter. Second, the Act provides forsubsequent State petitions for exemption, which necessarily means thatthe determination as to whether a State law prevails must be made on acase-by-case basis using criteria set forth in the Act. When DOE receivessuch a petition, it will be appropriate to consider preparing a federalismassessment consistent with the criteria in the Act.e. ``Takings'' Assessment ReviewExecutive Order 12630 (53 FR 8859, March 18, 1988) directs that, in proposinga regulation, an agency conduct a ``takings'' review. Such a review isintended to assist agencies in avoiding unnecessary takings that are necessitatedby statutory mandate.For purposes of the Order:<ITAG tagnum="21">``Policies that have takings implications'' refers to Federal regulations,proposed Federal regulations, proposed Federal legislation, comments onproposed Federal legislation, or other Federal policy statements that,if implemented or enacted, could effect a taking, such as rules and regulationsthat propose or implement licensing, permitting, or other condition requirementsor limitations on private property use, or that require dedications orexactions from owners of private property.</ITAG>It appears that there are three parts of the appliance standards programthat could conceivably be viewed as having ``takings implications.'' Theseare testing (certification) requirements, the impacts of standard levels,and possible DOE testing of products for validation.This proposed rulemaking is concerned with the second part, namely theimpacts of standard levels.The impact of standards could be viewed by some as a ``taking.'' Nevertheless,the Department believes that the fact that an energy conservation standardmay limit some manufacturers in the range of appliance efficiencies thatthey can produce does not have ``significant taking implications'' in thesense described in the Order. This notice does not change the impact ofthe NAECA standard.
