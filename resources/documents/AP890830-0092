(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A witness testifying in PTL founder JimBakker's fraud and conspiracy trial collapsed on the stand todayduring questioning, and court was recessed for the day afterparamedics carried him out on a stretcher.   Steve Nelson, a former PTL executive, had testified beforebecoming ill that the ministry was so overbooked with ``lifetimepartnerships'' that he warned Bakker and former aide Richard Dortchthat they could go to prison for the programs.   The partnership programs promised donors three nights of freelodging each year for life in exchange for $1,000 donations to PTL.   ``I told them I thought we had some big-time problems,'' saidNelson. ``I specifically said, `Someone could go to jail for this.'''   Dortch responded that PTL officials had checked out thepartnership programs with South Carolina officials and were assuredthat no laws had been broken, said Nelson, who became PTL's vicepresident for world outreach in 1985.   During cross examination, Nelson collapsed on the stand and fellto the floor. A member of the jury and an artist from the presssection rushed to help him   Bakker sat at the defense table until his attorney called himover to Nelson's side. Bakker appeared to be praying over Nelson,who quickly regained consciousness.   Sue Patterson, the courtroom artist who came to Nelson's aid,said he told her he hadn't eaten in several days. After paramedicstook Nelson away on a stretcher, U.S. District Judge Robert Potterrecessed court for the day.   Bakker is on trial on federal charges of fraud and conspiracy.Prosecutors say he and other PTL executives diverted more than $4million of the $158 million raised through partnership programs totheir own uses.   Dortch, 57, agreed on Aug. 8 to plead guilty to two counts ofwire fraud and one count each of mail fraud and conspiracy. The pleabargain came three weeks before he was scheduled to stand trial withBakker. Dortch was sentenced Aug. 24 to eight years in prison andfined $200,000.   Dortch, expected to be a key witness in the trial, was himselfhospitalized in Florida for undisclosed reasons. Dortch had alsobeen admitted in April to Morton Plant Hospital, in Clearwater,Fla., for chest pains.   Hospital spokesman Paul Gramblin said today that Dortch, wholives in Safety Harbor, Fla., asked doctors not disclose details ofhis condition.   Robert Dash of the U.S. attorney's office refused to discuss theeffects of Dortch's hospitalization on the proceedings. He saidDortch was not expected to be called this week.   Prosecution witnesses Tuesday portrayed Jim Bakker as anevangelist of extravagance, but attorneys for the PTL founder say hewas a busy minister concerned with saving souls.   David Taggart, a former aide to Bakker convicted of tax evasion,testified that the televangelist pursued an extravagant lifestyleand was enchanted with real estate.   ``He told me he wanted to have 10 homes,'' Taggart said.   Hollis Rule, a former computer programmer for PTL, testified hewent to his superiors with concerns that the partnerships wereoversold, numbering 64,000 in September 1985 despite Bakker'sself-imposed limit of 25,000.   Richard Ball, a PTL vice president, testified he relayed thoseconcerns to Bakker and another executive during a brief meeting atthe ministry's television studio.   ``They told me not to worry about it,'' Ball said.   Former PTL advertising writer Lois Chalmers testified that acampaign for the partnerships offered a David and Goliath sculpturesaid to be worth $1,000. But the ministry only paid $10 for them,she said. A silver version of the sculpture in Bakker's office mighthave been worth $1,000, she said.   Taggart testified that Bakker always accepted bonuses from theboard, even after objecting to them. The board in 1985 approvedborrowing $800,000 for operating expenses while voting Bakker a$200,000 bonus, Taggart said.   Bakker complained during a visit to Oral Roberts University inTulsa, Okla., that he didn't live as well as other evangelists,Taggart said.   ``They were showing us around,'' he said. ``Mr. Bakker said thathe lived shabbily compared to Oral Roberts, the (Rex) Humbards andother ministers.''   Taggart said electric bills at Bakker's lakefront parsonage inTega Cay, S.C., usually ran about $1,800 to $2,000 a month because``the pool was kept at a very high temperature ... in the 90s.''   The witness also recounted moving the Bakkers' clothing and otherbelongings in 1984 from Tega Cay to a house they owned in PalmSprings, Calif. He said the move was made on a private jet at a costto PTL of $105,000.   After The Charlotte Observer reported on the Bakkers' extravaganthomes, vacations and vintage cars, PTL hired a private investigatorfor at least $5,000 to follow the newspaper's publisher, editor anda reporter, Charles E. Shepard. The newspaper won a Pulitzer prizefor its reporting, and Shepard has a book coming out next month onthe rise and fall of Bakker and his ministry.   Bakker quit PTL in 1987 amid revelations about his 1980 sexualencounter with church secretary Jessica Hahn and a $265,000 payofffor her silence.   If convicted of all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy, Bakkercould be sentenced to 120 years in prison and fined $5 million.   Taggart and his brother James each face 25 years in prison and $1million in fines for their tax evasion convictions. The two wereconvicted in July of evading $525,000 in federal income taxes on$1.2 million they received from PTL.   In cross examination of Taggart, defense attorney Harold Benderasked about PTL checklists that included subjects ranging from hotelcleanliness and providing ministers to counsel people after aservice.   ``So Mr. Bakker was not only taking care of the day-to-day thingsat PTL _ the lights, the cleanliness _ he was also looking out forthe spiritual welfare of his congregation, wasn't he?'' Bender asked.   ``Yes, salvation was important,'' Taggart said.</TEXT></DOC>
