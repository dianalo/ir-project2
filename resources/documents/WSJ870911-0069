The failed banks were the Waxahachie Bank andamp; Trust Co., Waxahachie, whose two offices are to reopen today as branches of Merchants State Bank in Dallas, and La Marque Bank, La Marque, whose only office will reopen as a branch of First Bank of La Marque.    The Waxahachie bank had assets of $65.8 million and deposits of $62.3 million in 7,900 accounts. The La Marque Bank had assets of $5.6 million with $6.1 million in deposits in 1,800 accounts.    Earlier this week, the FDIC proposed the second biggest bailout in the agency's history to prevent the failure of First City Bancorp. of Texas, a major holding company with $12.1 billion in assets and 61 subsidiary banks in Texas. The closing of the two smaller banks yesterday brings to 38 the number of banks to fail this year in Texas, more than in any other state. </TEXT></DOC>
