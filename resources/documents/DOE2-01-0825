<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-01-0825 </DOCNO><TEXT>In recent years the authors have prepared a number of compounds consistingtetra-aryl porphyrins linked to quinones as models of the photosyntheticreaction center, and have studied their intramolecular light inducedelectron transfer reaction. In the systems examined the electron donorand light absorber (the porphyrin) has been attached to the electronacceptor (the quinone) by a variety of linkages. These include flexiblepolymethylene chains and rigid [2:2:2]-bicyclo-octane rings. In addition,they have prepared a compound consisting of a tetra-aryl porphyrin attachedto a cyclodextrin ring; the latter is a cylindrically shaped moleculemade up of 7 glucose units which is capable of complexing electron acceptorsinto its interior. The efficiency of intramolecular light induced electrontransfer in these compounds has been examined by epr, fluorescence andflash photolysis and the results have been published. They now reportresults obtained with some new linked donor-acceptor compounds consistingof a porphyrin linked to a quinone by an amide group, and of a porphyrinlinked to a quinone by phenyl and biphenyl groups; the light inducedelectron transfer properties of these compounds have been examined byflash photolysis and steady state and time resolved fluorescence spectroscopy.The effect of the nature of the linkage and of the supporting mediumupon the electron transfer reaction has been examined.</TEXT></DOC>
