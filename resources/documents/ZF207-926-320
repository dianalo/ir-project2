 Just in the last few weeks, the industry has indulged in morepublic mud-slinging, backroom politicking, and general nastiness than we'veseen since the Bush-Dukakis campaign.andM;Credit for the earliest breach of public etiquette probably belongs toAdobe's John Warnock, who told an audience at the Seybold Conference inSeptember that a joint Apple-Microsoft font licensing deal was &quot;the biggestbunch of garbage and mumbo-jumbo I've ever heard in my life.&quot;andP;  Warnock wasn'tthe only one to lose his cool over this unexpected alliance: The head of theProfessional PostScript Alliance, for instance, told MacWeek he thinks &quot;Applehas more money than brains.&quot;andM;Then there's the Great Windows Plot.andP;  In a rare display of public bad temper,Software Publishing Corp.'s Fred Gibbons recently accused Microsoft ofdeliberately conning developers into creating unprofitable PresentationManager products, so that the gang from Redmond could have a clear shot atthe more lucrative Windows market.andP;  Gibbons is just a sore loser, shot backMicrograx's Paul Grayson, an early Windows enthusiast, who told Infoworldthat Gibbons is a typical &quot;Windows whiner.&quot;andM;Gibbons hasn't picked up much overt support for his conspiracy theory, but agood many of the industry's heavyweights are worried about balance-of-powerissues.andP;  Lotus and WordPerfect are integrating their Presentation Managerproducts to help counter Microsoft's growing strength in applications.andP;  AndIBM, unhappy over Microsoft's plans to release a supercharged Windows 3.0version that is bound to cannibalize Presentation Manager sales, has beenlooking for ways to shrink PM into a &quot;Lite&quot; version that can compete moreeffectively against Windows 3.0.andP;  (In turn, Microsoft's Steve Ballmer haspublically rebuked IBM for tinkering with PM without &quot;getting our buy-in,&quot;and Bill Gates vowed to PC Week that &quot;there'll never be a thing called PMLite.&quot;)andM;And so it goes.andP;  Bickering among competitors isn't new, of course, but thistime we get a sense that more people than ever are throwing fits in publicforums and calling each other names in front of reporters.andP;  Miss Mannerswould be appalled.andM;Clearly, the long-awaited move to graphical environments isn't goingsmoothly.andP;  Like most major upheavals, the transition threatens to reapportionpower and leadership, and it forces many smaller players to take sides orrisk being trampled.andP;  In addition, the transition has become even morepoliticized by the industry's intense ambivalence about Microsoft itself--acompany that is simultaneously the visionary sponsor of PC and Macintoshgraphical environments, a hard-driving and increasingly successful competitorin the applications market, and a consistently exploitative partner in manyof its strategic alliances.andM;It's almost certainly too early to predict how the current round of graphicalpolitics will shake out.andP;  But we'd like to offer a few general observationsand possible scenarios:andM;* Graphical politics will temporarily paralyze the marketplace.andP;  A great manycorporate end users and developers finally have been convinced that they haveto jump aboard the graphical bandwagon, without being too clear about thedifferences among various environments.andP;  Now, we suspect that the heightenednoise level and political maneuvering will force end users and developers tolook more closely at these differences.andP;  The lack of a consensus aboutgraphical standards should make graphical environments seem considerablyriskier, especially to larger, more conservative players.andP;  Until the dustsettles, we expect that a lot of plans will be put on hold; in fact, themarket for Windows and PM products may even lose some momentum over the nextyear.andM;* Nevertheless, Mac-like interfaces will proliferate.andP;  A lot of people whoshould know better still seem to think that the only way to achieve the kindof user-friendly, consistent interfaces that are characteristic of theMacintosh is to adopt Windows or Presentation Manager.andP;  In reality, most Macconventions--mouse support, pull-down menus, windowing, dialog boxes, scrollbars, etc.--don't really require a graphical environment.andP;  A large percentageof the new and upgraded PC products we've seen lately have a Mac-like lookand feel, even in straight character mode.andP;  (Ironically, some of the mostincomprehensible graphical interfaces seem to be showing up on Windows-basedproducts.)andP;  Assuming this trend continues, the PC software world will end upsharing common interface conventions with the Macintosh, quite independentlyof the success of Windows, PM, and other environments.andM;* No &quot;standard&quot; environment will prevail.andP;  Much to the dismay of PCdevelopers who still remember writing for a unified DOS environment,graphical environments are proliferating so fast that it's hard to keep trackof their family trees.andP;  By next year, PC developers will face two versions ofWindows and probably separate 286 and 386 versions of PM.andP;  In addition,there's GEM, the Graphic Software Systems and Matrix toolkits, and otherenvironments that have surprisingly broad followings.andP;  Tandy'squasi-graphical DeskMate interface is likely to get better, and we've seen atleast one other unannounced environment that will probably attract serioussupport in the mass market.andP;  Moreover, most of the hard-core CAD and chartingpackages still rely on proprietary graphical environments.andP;  Maybe we'remissing something, but we don't see how a true standard--with a common fontand imaging model, inter-application data exchange, and strict interfacedesign conventions--is going to emerge from this hodge-podge of nichestandards.andM;* Microsoft will end up owning the Windows market.andP;  With the formal unveilinglast week of Word for Windows, Microsoft has begun to show off its grandstrategy for a suite of tightly integrated Windows-based applications.andO;Microsoft now has a strong presence in two key segments--spreadsheets andword processing--and the nucleus of a presumably proprietary control languagethat will allow users to create customizeable graphical workstations(Soft*letter, 12/1/88).andP;  Although smaller Windows developers like Aldus andMicrografx may carve out safe harbors in the Windows market, Microsoftprobably has such a commanding lead in mainstream applications that its majorrivals will be reluctant to compete in an environment they perceive asMicrosoft's home turf.andM;* Software politics will rescue Presentation Manager.andP;  We've been watchingsurveys that track enthusiasm for PM, and we've noticed an interestingphenomenon: As PM becomes more of a real product, fewer end users say they'lladopt it.andP;  Nevertheless, we expect that aggressive lobbying efforts by ananti-Microsoft alliance will persuade IBM to create new versions of PM thatare significantly tighter and better-looking than the current &quot;heavy&quot;release.andP;  By virtue of IBM's relatively impartial sponsorship, PM--in someform--will begin to look more like a level playing field to developers whoare just moving into the graphical marketplace.andP;  Thus, despite its flaws, PMmay turn out to be the environment of choice because it represents the safestpolitical alternative.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
