The report, by the staff of the House Banking Committee, chargedthat the Federal Asset Disposition Association has become a``bloated bureacracy'' that wastes millions of dollars of publicmoney.   Committee Chairman Fernand G. St Germain, D-R.I., in an writtenstatement accompanying the report, said FADA should be phased outas soon as possible and its duties reassumed by the Federal Savingsand Loan Insurance Corp., which backs deposits in federally insuredSandamp;Ls.   The House report was dated March 17, but it was not made publicuntil Friday, when it was published in the Congressional Record.   In a letter dated March 31, but not released by FADA untilFriday, the agency's chairman, William F. McKenna submitted hisresignation, effective immediately.   McKenna, a Los Angeles attorney, wrote that his resignation ``isintended to open the way'' for the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,which regulates 3,147 federal thrift institutions, to pick hisreplacement and ``achieve maximum capability with FADA's newexecutive command and chartered course.''   He has been replaced, on an acting basis, by Vice Chairman JohnB. Zellars, chairman of Georgia Federal Bank in Atlanta.   McKenna was previously chairman of the Federal Savings and LoanAdvisory Council, an industry group that advises federalregulators. His law firm represents some of the largest Sandamp;Ls in theindustry and the creation of FADA was his idea.   The stated purpose of FADA is bring money into the Sandamp;L insurancefund, at a time when it is short of funds to resolve the problemsof soaring insolvencies, particularly in Texas and other stateshard hit by depressed oil prices.   However, the House report said ``the unspoken agenda was to givethe savings and loan industry, more specifically a small but verypowerful subgroup of the industry, a major say in how the thriftindustry's problems would be resolved.''   The report said it was ``difficult to determine'' how much moneyFADA has wasted, but it said has directly charged $20 million toreceiverships set up to liquidate failed Sandamp;Ls and it has passed on$51 million in subcontractor costs. Despite this income, FADA ismore than $15 million in the red, the report said.   Money spent by the receiverships is deducted from what iseventually left for the creditors of failed institutions, includingdepositors over the insurance limit of $100,000.   Gerald Carmen, who took over as FADA chief executive inFebruary, said he is working to remedy the agency's faults.   ``We know there have been problems with FADA and that's why theybrought me aboard,'' he said. ``I have not read the report, butwhen I do read it, problems that are real and exist, we're going tofix.''   Carmen said he hoped within six months to resolve ``long-rangeand strategic'' questions, such as whether FADA should be mergedwith the insurance fund, be completely privatized or continue underits present structure.   He said he has reduced the FADA payroll from 388 to 370employees, saving $1 million a year and is consolidating FADAoffice space for a reduction of 16,000 square feet. He predictedFADA would be in the black for the first quarter of the year.   ``I think we're starting to bring it under control,'' Carmensaid.   However, the House report described reform efforts so far as``cosmetic'' and as public relations ``intended to defusecriticism.''   Among the other findings of the House report:   _FADA employees awarded contracts, without bidding, to formerbusiness associates.   _``FADA officials lived first class and received excessivesalaries and bonuses.'' It said its top 32 executives were paidover $3 million in 1987 and its total payroll of $22 million wentto more 380 employees.   _From its creation in late 1985 to the end of last year, itmanaged to sell only $124 million of the property in its care.   _``Certain FADA employees continue to maintain financialinterests in firms that could benefit from FADA contracts.''   William Fulwider, a spokesman for the bank board, said theinformation in the House report is dated. He said FADA is reducingits expenses and is cooperating more fully with FSLIC.   Mark Clark, a vice president of the U.S. League of SavingsInstitutions, the largest trade group in the industry, said leagueofficials would have no immediate comment.</TEXT></DOC>
