Mr. Finney, who acted in Steppenwolf's1986 London production of Lyle Kessler's &quot;Orphans,&quot; is hererepeating his 1989 West End performance in Mr. Harwood's play&quot;Another Time.&quot; Mr. Harwood, who also wrote &quot;The Dresser,&quot;directs this production as well.   Now with all due respect to Messrs. Finney and Harwood, itseems fair to ask what possessed Steppenwolf artisticdirector Randall Arney to hire an English play, director andlead actor for the opening of a high-tech theater built tohouse an extraordinary American company. Why couldn't Mr.Arney have commissioned a play from somebody like ChicagoanDavid Mamet, cast a Steppenwolf stalwart like John Malkovich,and directed it himself? Perhaps Steppenwolf is a victim ofits own success. Many company members are in heavy demand inHollywood. Have a look at &quot;Sleeping With the Enemy,&quot; &quot;DickTracy,&quot; &quot;Class Action,&quot; &quot;Sheltering Sky,&quot; &quot;Queens Logic,&quot;&quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bridge&quot; or a variety of other current films,and you'll see Kevin Anderson, Glenne Headly, Tim Hopper,Austin Pendleton, Mr. Malkovich and other members of theSteppenwolf company. Ironically, Steppenwolf may have had toreach across the Atlantic to find unemployed talent itconsidered worthy of opening its new house. In any case, theHarwood play is a good one to showcase Steppenwolf's newhouse.</LP><TEXT>   For most of its first 15 years, the company played in aconverted Halsted Street dairy with virtually no space forscenery or equipment. As a result, Steppenwolf had no choicebut to concentrate on the physics of acting, and to develop ahigh-energy style of playing right into the faces of itsaudiences. &quot;Another Time&quot; helps to justify the move downHalsted Street into a user-friendly performing space. Thisingeniously contrived play couldn't have been done in the olddairy because it requires several sets that must quicklyrevolve into place as the action spins on. In each of the twoacts, we first witness what happens among people in one room,and then what happened simultaneously among those in anadjacent room.   Steppenwolf's resident designer, Kevin Rigdon, who headedthe design team that built the new theater, must be exultantover what his new space let him do in designing the cramped,suffocating rooms of a Cape Town, South Africa, bungalow thatMr. Harwood calls for in act one, and the space-age Londonrecording studio of act two. But even with all this technicalversatility, Steppenwolf has not lost its soul. The newtheater seats only 500, and is built so Steppenwolf'saudiences remain threateningly close to the action. Indeed,much of the design effort went toward protecting andenhancing the space's basic theatrical impact rather than togadgetry.   To keep out the sound of Chicago's elevated trains and thetheater's mechanical equipment, the structure is actually twobuildings separated by a one-inch air gap. In an era ofamplified actors' voices, the new Steppenwolf is acousticallylive enough to carry the subtleties of unwired voicesthroughout the house. In the first act of &quot;Another Time,&quot; Mr.Finney and the company demonstrate that state-of-the-artstagecraft can amplify rather than obscure excellent acting.In fact, Mr. Finney, a big man best known for his epic filmportrayal of Tom Jones, is virtually unrecognizable as thebitter, sickly, wizened Ike Lands, a Lithuanian Jewish emigre&quot;spat out by history&quot; into South Africa. Ike is trapped in amiserable marriage, incapable of making any money or helpinghis extraordinarily talented teenage son Leonard get toEurope to study piano. But Ike takes responsibility fornothing, claiming that he was &quot;dealt a bad hand.&quot; Zadok, hisbrother-in-law, suggests to him that his problems, evenperhaps his deformed hand, are the products of his mind,rather than destiny, but Ike wallows in self-imposedhelplessness.   Steppenwolf's consistently interesting Terry Kinneyeffectively conveys self-deprecating passive-aggressive Zadokwith the same skill he brought to the role of Casy last yearin &quot;The Grapes of Wrath.&quot; Rondi Reed plays Ike's wife, Belle,with true grit, keeping resolutely out of the hopeless gloomspread by her husband and scrambling to get Leonard what heneeds.   Ike dies at the end of act one, but Mr. Finney returns inact two as the mature Leonard, now a famous concert pianist.Here, alas, Mr. Finney is all too recognizable as himself. Asuccessful middle-aged concert pianist is not much of a reachfor a successful middle-aged actor, and he seems no more thancooling down from his virtuoso performance in act one.   Ms. Reed continues as Belle, but it's not easy to age 35years in one intermission, and Ms. Reed doesn't successfullydo it. The result is that she fails to face off convincinglyagainst her son Leonard, when he struggles to tell her hewon't return to perform in Cape Town. His refusal, he says,is a political statement, but it's clear that apartheid is aconvenient excuse for staying away from Belle and from thescene of his miserable childhood. His talent may have beenforged by his painful youth, but he resists his mother whenshe insists he ought to come home.   For this second act to work, Leonard must seem on thepoint of giving in to his mother, reminding us of his weakfather. Belle must almost overpower him, but Ms. Reed nevercame close to getting the upper hand with Mr. Finney.   Not a simple task, perhaps, but Steppenwolf actors arewell known for meeting such challenges, pushed hard bySteppenwolf directors. Here, of course, Steppenwolf did notask one of its own to direct &quot;Another Time. This is all themore curious because Mr. Harwood did not direct the Londonproduction of his play. And in Chicago, the general tone ofhis direction is, well, a bit too languid, too English forSteppenwolf actors.   Only Molly Regan drives relentlessly through the entireevening as the young and then the old Rose, Belle's librarianspinster sister, who quaintly fails to understand either lifeor literature.   All this shows that Steppenwolf might better stick withits own if it is to fulfill the promise of this new house.The unanswered question is whether its own will come homefrom Hollywood from time to time to play in this marvelousnew space. If this new theater can't get them back, nothingwill.</TEXT></DOC>
