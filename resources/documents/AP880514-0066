There were no immediate reports of arrests or injuries.   The march broke off from a rally of about 10,000 students fromuniversities around the country who gathered at Korea University.   Some prominent dissident leaders, including the Rev. MoonIk-hwan, attended the rally. Relatives of hundreds of jaileddissidents also participated.   The students, many wearing headbands reading ``unification,''also asked the government of President Roh Tae-woo to makeconcessions to persuade North Korea to join the Seoul Olympic Gamesin the fall.   In a separate statement, the demonstrators proposed that studentleaders of South and North Korea meet on June 10 to discussnational unification and the Olympic co-hosting.   Unification of the Korean Peninsula has emerged as a majorcampus issue as radical students shifted their anti-governmentstrategy after legislative elections last month, when theopposition made a strong showing.   North Korea has said it would boycott the Olympics in Seoulunless it is allowed to co-host the Games.   After the campus rally, about 5,000 students walked out of theschool to begin what they called ``a grand peace march'' toheadquarters of the National Red Cross in downtown Seoul.   When the marchers went 1,000 yards, about 2,000 riot policeintervened, pushing the students to both sides of the street. Somestudents responded by throwing rocks.   Many protesters were forced back to the school, where they beganthrowing hundreds of firebombs and rocks over the fence. Policeretaliated with tear gas.</TEXT></DOC>
