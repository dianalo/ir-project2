During the test rig{number_sign}3 shake down test runs it became apparent that the intensityof the dust and rain storms surrounding the fluid ring sealed bearingend within the ``mini'' climate chamber could be appropriately observedthrough small windows at 12:00 and 6:00 o'clock provided in the endwallof the ``mini-climate'' chamber, rig {number_sign}3 was accordingly modifiedand the dust and rain exposure tests were conducted at numerous levelsof severity. 6 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
