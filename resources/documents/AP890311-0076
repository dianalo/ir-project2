(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. David Scheider is having adifficult time practicing what he preaches when it comes to MiddleEast hostage Terry Anderson.   Scheider has been urging residents of Anderson's hometown inupstate New York not to despair over the journalist's nearly fouryears of captivity in Beirut, Lebanon.   ``We Americans are an action-oriented people. It's so difficultfor us to sit back and just pray,'' he said.   Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped March 16, 1985, by Moslem extremists in Beirutand has been held the longest of 12 foreign hostages.   Residents of Batavia will gather this week to observe theanniversary of Anderson's abduction.   ``There isn't a person in town who doesn't know who Terry is andwho doesn't regret what's happened to him,'' said Steven Hawley, ahigh school classmate of Anderson, a 1965 graduate of Batavia HighSchool.   Batavia, a city of 17,000 located 35 miles east of Buffalo, hasshown its concern. To mark the third anniversary of Anderson'scapture, hundreds of residents donned yellow ribbons and marched ina candlelight vigil. And people turned out by the thousands to signgreeting cards that were sent to Beirut for his 41st birthday lastOctober.   However, the events masked deep anxiety within the community overwhat to do about the hostages.   Many people support Anderson's sister, Peggy Say, who hastraveled throughout the world, urging national leaders to work forher brother's release.   However, her outspokenness, including complaints that Americanofficials have not done enough for the hostages, has put off somemembers of the community.   Batavia is a conservative town built around a VeteransAdministration hospital with a sign that reads ``The Price OfFreedom Is Visible Here.''   Some people even considered Mrs. Say unpatriotic for criticizingthe Reagan administration, said Hawley, a Republican legislator inGenesee County.   Even Mrs. Say's supporters, such as Ann Zickl, acknowledge thather comments were difficult for some people to accept.   ``She's a strong, strong woman and this is a traditionalcommunity,'' Mrs. Zickl said.   Some questioned whether negative attention generated by Mrs.Say's comments served the captors' purposes.   ``At some point, many people began to wonder whether the mediaattention may have been responsible for prolonging things,'' saidKathy Conley, another classmate of Anderson who had been active onhis behalf. ``And, I think I might agree that his captors certainlyknow what an issue he has become.''   Mrs. Say acknowledges that the situation became politicized, butshe insists she had no other option but to speak out.   Former hostages have told Mrs. Say that Anderson's captors wouldkill him if they thought Americans had forgotten him.   ``My path is clear,'' she said. ``We've got to keep the pressureon because that's what has kept Terry alive.''   Mrs. Say spoke from her home in Cadiz, Ky., where she said sheand her husband, David, moved last year for privacy.   She has returned to Batavia several times to meet with supportersand for interviews with the local media, and was expected to returnSunday for an ecumenical service at Notre Dame High School.   Her supporters say attitudes are changing.   ``You don't hear real criticism of her anymore,'' said TerryFritts, the host of a talk show on local radio station WBTA. ``Ithink people understand better what she was trying to do now.''   ``There is also a lot of sympathy for her and her family,'' Ms.Fritts added.   In addition to Anderson's captivity, the family has suffered thedeath of his father and brother.   Scheider said the ordeal has been a challenge for people toseparate political issues from humanitarian concerns.   Hawley said that although people have disagreed with Mrs. Say,there is no animosity toward her.   ``I'm not sure I wouldn't do the same thing if it was mybrother,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
