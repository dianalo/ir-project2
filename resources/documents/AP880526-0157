Whitehead told senators Thursdaythat other countries increasingly see U.S. military bases as aliability rather than an asset.   ``This is a disturbing situation,'' he said.   Whitehead mentioned Greece, Portugal, Turkey and thePhilippines, in all of which the United States is negotiating onthe future of its bases.   The House on Wednesday approved a bill to provide $14.3 billionin aid for the fiscal year beginning Sept. 30. The final amountwill depend on agreement between the House and Senate.   The administration is asking for a 3.7 percent increase inmilitary aid, with all equipment being transferred for the firsttime as grants rather than loans.   ``Loans only add to our allies' burden of debt, which may not berepaid anyway,'' Whitehead said.   He was testifying before the foreign operations subcommittee ofthe Senate Appropriations Committee.   Whitehead said an overall aid increase of 2 percent over thisyear's level is needed to restore funds for key programs inPortugal, South America, the Caribbean and Africa which either gotno money this year or were drastically cut.   ``We cannot expect others to be dependable friends if we cannotbe one ourselves,'' he said.   Edward J. Derwinski, undersecretary of state for securityassistance, said there is no debate about the need of thePhilippines for aid.   ``As a newly restored democracy, an ally, and a country facing adangerous communist insurgency, the Philippines is looking forsignificantly higher assistance levels from the United States, itsprincipal security partner,'' he said.   Lt. Gen. Charles W. Brown, in charge of foreign aid at thePentagon, called the request of $110 million for the Philippines areasonable amount, saying that it was $15 million less thanCongress earmarked for this year.   ``In addition, the amount of assistance that the Philippinearmed forces can optimally absorb this year is limited,'' he said.   ``The Philippines requires a great deal of assistance to resolveits security problems, but it should be applied in the context ofan efficient and reliable long-term program.''   Whitehead questioned whether $45 million asked for Afghanistanwill be enough as five million Afghan refugees in Pakistan and Iranseek to return to their homes following the withdrawal of Soviettroops.</TEXT></DOC>
