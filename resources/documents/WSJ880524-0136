Quebec's government this month enacted a series of measures aimed at boosting the birth rate, including cash incentives of 3,000 Canadian dollars ($2,417) for the third child in any family, and the same amount for every subsequent child.    In announcing the policy, Quebec Premier Robert Bourassa said that the province is concerned that its population of 6.5 million people, most of them French speakers, may soon decline. &quot;I cannot, as leader of Quebec's Francophones, be impassive and indifferent in the face of a situation that could become dramatic within several decades,&quot; Mr. Bourassa said.    The pro-birth package includes incometax cuts for families and interest-free loans for parents buying their first home; promises of additional day-care space; and a cash bonus of 500 dollars at the birth of a first child and another 500 dollars for a second child. The 3,000-dollar bonus for each child beyond that will be payable quarterly until the child reaches two years of age.    Both the federal and Quebec governments have long paid monthly allowances to parents to help offset the cost of raising children. These currently add up to 29.64 dollars a month for the first child and 91.99 dollars for the third child. What makes Quebec's cash bonuses different is that they are offered as a straight-forward reward for giving birth, rather than as a form of economic assistance.    Fertility rates have fallen throughout the industrialized world and in many countries are below 2.1 children for each woman of child-bearing age, the generally accepted level at which a society must reproduce to sustain its population. In Quebec, the rate is 1.4 children, compared with 1.7 for all of Canada and about 1.8 for the U.S. Quebec's rate is &quot;about as low as anywhere in the world,&quot; says Ben Wattenberg, a fellow of the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute and author of &quot;The Birth Dearth.&quot;    Quebec officials say their plan is inspired by European programs to stem birth-rate declines. France for decades has offered a web of incentives, including payments to pregnant women and to women who quit their jobs to care for a third child; housing subsidies; allowances that last until a child is 20 years old; and even reduced movie-ticket prices.    West Germany, whose fertility rate had fallen to 1.3 children, added cash bonuses in 1986 to its system of child allowances. Paying 600 marks ($353) a month for the first six months after a child's birth, and as much as the same amount for the following six months, the program helped push up the number of births to 640,000 last year from 485,000 in 1985.    Some countries, like Sweden, emphasize indirect incentives, including paid maternity leave.    Whatever the measures to encourage child-bearing, however, some experts question their impact. Henry David, director of Transnational Family Research Institute in Bethesda, Md., says countries often experience &quot;a momentary success for a year or two and then things go back down again.&quot; Quebec's experience appears to bear him out: Over several years, it raised the allowance it pays for a third child, with no discernible impact on the birth rate.    Robert Dutil, the Quebec minister responsible for family policy, says the government's aim is to help families. &quot;What we want to do is eliminate the obstacles that make it difficult for parents to have children and remain on the job market while living in a modern society,&quot; he says. As for the birth rate, he would like it to increase to 1.8 children from 1.4 children over five years.    Mr. Dutil, who has three children, says it is important for some mothers to have a third baby to compensate for the 30% of women who are unlikely to have any. It is the state's duty, he suggests, to help parents meet the financial burden of moving into a bigger home or buying a bigger car to accommodate their growing broods.    Quebec's low birth rate is of major concern to groups such as the Centrale de l'Enseignement du Quebec, the province's largest teachers' union. In a recent policy document, the union argued that if the demographic trends in Quebec aren't reversed, the province could be faced with &quot;the gradual shrinking of its majority French-speaking population until extinction or the progressive disappearance of its specific cultural characteristics by assimilation into English-speaking North America.&quot;    Jacques Henripin, a demographer at the University of Montreal, says that the threat to French Canada's survival comes not only from Quebec's low birth rate but from emigration to other parts of Canada.    Although Mr. Henripin concedes that the success of the bonus program isn't assured, he says that &quot;it's a start.&quot; He adds: &quot;There's an aspect that is strictly financial but there's a symbolic effect as well. Society is saying that it's important to have children.&quot;    For many Quebecers, the policy isn't likely to change much. Michael Provencher, 30-year-old legal counsel to a paper concern in Kingsey-Falls, Quebec, says he and his wife plan to have children but &quot;it isn't the government that is going to decide how many we have.&quot;    Robert Girouard, a Montreal public-relations manager, has two children and no plans for any others. &quot;The Dincs (double-income, no-children couples) and single people are in a position to get the most out of this system in terms of career and quality of life,&quot; he says. &quot;They have the BMWs and the expensive condos. They don't have to take the kids to the arena, to tennis or to piano lessons.&quot;    And Leon Lafleur, who heads a community clinic in the Montreal inner-city neighborhood of Plateau Mont Royal, says he is worried that some of his poorest clients may be tempted to have a child simply to collect the 3,000-dollar bonus. &quot;The danger is there,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
