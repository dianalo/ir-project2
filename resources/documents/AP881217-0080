Bush has backed off one campaign pledge completely: his promiseto name Vice President-elect Dan Quayle to head the nation's drugenforcement effort.   And he has modified other campaign positions in light of changingpolitical realities, such as his vow to not deal with the PalestineLiberation Organization.   In the area of relations with the Soviets, Bush has displayedmore caution than was evident in his campaign utterances, urging ago-slow approach both toward a summit with Soviet leader MikhailGorbachev and to new talks to cut strategic arms.   And on the federal budget, Bush has been shifting his stance:first hinting that he would not submit his own budget this winter,then saying that he recognized he must take the initiative.   In areas of style, Bush has displayed a certain zest in hisfrequent encounters with reporters and has suggested he will holdmore frequent news conferences than President Reagan.   But he also issued a warning: no more answering of shoutedquestions at photo-taking sessions once he takes office _ a tacticthat had become a standard practice of reporters covering the ReaganWhite House.   Meanwhile, the vice president has been meeting with scores ofindividuals and organization in an effort to reach out to friend andformer foe alike, including meetings defeated rival Michael Dukakis,Democrat Jesse Jackson and the Coretta Scott King, the widow ofslain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr.   During his campaign, Bush said he hoped to have a summit withGorbachev as soon as possible after he takes office.   However, on Friday, answering questions after announcing hisselection of former Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, Bush said``there is no expectation that we will or won't'' have such an earlysession _ saying he didn't want to send the wrong signal and appearover hasty.   A few days earlier, Bush said he plans to move slowly in armstalks with the Soviets and said ``there is no way'' hisadministration would have a detailed program on arms talks by ascheduled Feb. 5 date for the resumption of talks.   ``It will be a different kind of White House. It's going to bebrimming with kids, a very uplifting kind of family setting. Interms of style, I think George Bush is going to be closer to JohnKennedy than Ronald Reagan,'' said Iowa Rep. Jim Leach, a moderateRepublican.   ``He's going to be very hands-on and involved. Capitol Hill hasbeen increasingly frustrated in dealing with a disengaged president.I think the Bush administration will have a very positiveattitude,'' Leach continued.   But Norman Ornstein, a political analyst for the conservativeAmerican Enterprise Institute, said Bush ``is trying to balance andjuggle in the transition, as he did in the campaign, two verydifferent personalities.''   ``One is the tough, hard-nosed, `read my lips, make my day'George Bush. That's the George Bush who basically says, we've got totake it easy with the Soviets. We're not going to rush to judgementon a (strategic arms limitation treaty) with the Soviets,'' Ornsteinsaid.   ``The other is the kinder and gentler, thousand points of light,to reach out to Congress, to Jesse Jackson, to various groups GeorgeBush, the one who writes who writes little notes to everybody.   ``He's managed to juggle the two personalities very adroitly. ButI`m not sure it's going to be as easy to do once he's inaugurated,''Ornstein added.   After vowing repeatedly to make his vice president a drug czar inhis administration, Bush in recent days has suggested he won't,saying to do so would ``circumvent a law'' passed by Congress thatrequires him to name someone other than the vice president to such apost.   On the subject of one of Reagan's pet projects, the ``Star Wars''Strategic Defense Initiative, Bush has reiterated his support forthe program to shield the nation against incoming nuclear missiles.   But, just as in the campaign, there was still some ambivalence tothe vice president's commitment to the plan _ heightened by commentsby Tower on Friday suggesting SDI's usefulness as a bargaining``lever'' in dealing with the Soviets.   Bush has voiced support for the Reagan administration decision toopen talks with PLO chief Yasser Arafat _ a decision that spares himfrom having to make the tough call but means the talks will proceedon his watch.   At the same time, he has indicated skepticism and caution,telling reporters, ``I honestly don't know where it will lead.''   ``I wouldn't overstate the importance of this in terms of theformulation of our own Middle East policy,'' Bush said last week.   But, asked whether he would pursue a campaign demand that the PLOchange its covenant to eliminate language supporting the destructionof Israel, Bush indicated he would not. ``I don't want to set theclock back,'' he said.   On other issues, Bush continues to decline to spell out where hewould make cuts to trim the federal budget deficit, brushing asidespecific questions on what he would do for the homeless and how hewould pay for refurbishing antiquated nuclear weapons plants.   On farm programs, Bush declared ``I don't believe we are going tobalance the budget eventually on the backs of the farmers,'' butwent on to say he favored allowing ``more market forces that lead tolower supports and lower subsidies.''   On trade issues, Bush indicated that he would continue recentReagan administration policy of firing ``rifle shot'' tradesanctions at economic allies that discriminate against U.S. goods to``show our determination to have fair trade and equal access.''</TEXT></DOC>
