The agreement provided for investigations of subsurface contaminationat Air Force Installation Restoration Program sites. The purpose of theseinvestigations was to demonstrate and evaluate inexpensive and relativelyrapid reconnaissance techniques which can detect and map subsurface organiccontamination. The information can reduce the number and improve theplacement of wells required in an investigation. The methods chosen fordemonstrations included active and passive soil-gas sampling and analysis,and the geophysical techniques of electromagnetic induction (EM), anddirect current resistivity. Field studies were performed at four AirForce Bases. The active soil-gas sampling technique successfully mappedsolvents, gasoline, and JP-4 contamination at the four bases where itwas used. The passive soil-gas technique was successful in some cases,but not as successful as the active technique. The geophysical methodswere also successful for site characterization.</TEXT></DOC>
