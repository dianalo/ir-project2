Scientists said the development proves the commercialfeasibility of &quot;pharming&quot; -- using herds of animals as livingpharmaceutical factories. Pharming may give the biotechnologyindustry a cheaper, better way to make genetically engineereddrugs now made in vats by bacteria and other microbesgenetically altered to produce human proteins.</LP><TEXT>   Reports by U.S. and British teams said they have developedgenetically altered goats and sheep, respectively, thatsecrete sizable amounts of drugs in their milk. In a thirdreport, scientists in the Netherlands said they developed thefirst practical technique to put foreign genes in cattle,which eventually could lead to an even more productive sourceof drugs in milk. The three teams reported their findings inthe September issue of the journal Bio/Technology.   Researchers previously had inserted foreign genes in miceand some other animals to cause them to produce in their milktiny amounts of proteins potentially useful as medicines. Butit remained to be seen whether the technique would work infarm animals to enable large-scale production of therapeuticproteins. Besides making genetically engineered drugs cheaper-- such drugs cost $1,000 or more a gram -- pharming may leadto better variants of existing drugs.   Scientists made the &quot;transgenic&quot; animals -- those thatcarry a foreign gene -- involved in the studies by injectinggenes for human proteins into their early stage embryos alongwith genetic switches that only turn on the genes in mammaryglands. The switches prevent the human genes from beingactivated in blood cells or other tissues, which could harmthe animals. The method also makes it easier to retrieve thedrug molecules, because they are secreted in milk and don'thave to be extracted from tissues.   Pharming promises to make available certain proteins thatare potentially valuable as medicines but that currentlycan't be made cheaply enough for widespread use, said AlanSmith, senior vice president, research, at Genzyme Corp., aCambridge, Mass., biotechnology concern working withtransgenic goats. An example, he added, is human serumalbumin, a blood protein used by patients with liver damage.   The Genzyme team, working with researchers at TuftsUniversity, reported in Bio/Technology that they havedeveloped transgenic goats producing two to three grams ofthe drug TPA per liter of milk. TPA, or tissue plasminogenactivator, dissolves blood clots and is used to clear blockedarteries in heart-attack patients; currently it is made inbioreactor vats. The researchers said the TPA moleculesecreted by the goats is a chemical variant of the moleculethat they believe will work longer after injection than theform now sold as a drug. Genzyme developed the TPA variantfour years ago and has applied to patent it.   Genzyme's Mr. Smith cautioned that the safety andeffectiveness of the goat-produced TPA hasn't beenestablished in humans. Moreover, he said, researchers stillmust refine their methods so they can reliably produce manytransgenic animals that make large amounts of desiredproteins in their milk. Getting pure extracts of the drugsfrom milk also poses problems, but scientists &quot;know a lotabout milk proteins&quot; and so should be able to solve thoseproblems easily, Mr. Smith added.   The U.K. team, in Edinburgh, reported that it developedtransgenic sheep that secrete in milk alpha-1-antitrypsin, anenzyme used to prevent mucous from building up in the lungsof people with emphysema. The team, including researchers atPharmaceutical Proteins Ltd. and the AFRC Institute of AnimalPhysiology and Genetics Research, said that in test-tubestudies the sheep-produced enzyme showed therapeutic activity&quot;indistinguishable&quot; from the human-blood version.   The team added that one of its transgenic sheep made 35grams of the drug in each liter of milk -- a huge amount bybiotechnology standards. Human blood contains just two gramsof the substance per liter; to supply one patient for oneyear would require 100 liters of blood.   The Netherlands group, a collaboration between theEuropean operations of Ge Pharm International Inc., Mountain.View, Calif., and the Dutch Ministry of Agriculture, reportedit developed a proprietary technique to insert foreign genesin cattle and has produced the first transgenic calf. Theanimal, a bull, carries a gene for human lactoferrin, ananti-bacterial substance that could be useful in medicinesfor patients with weakened immune systems -- including thosewith acquired immune deficiency syndrome, GenPharm said.   While lactoferrin can't be obtained from the bull, the newtechnique for making transgenic cattle represents &quot;a dramaticbreakthrough in enlarging the transgenic pharm-yard,&quot; saidBio/Technology editor Harvey Bialy in an editorial.Developing such cattle previously required &quot;prohibitivelyexpensive&quot; surgical procedures to genetically alter andimplant embryos, he added. GenPharm said it plans to breedthe bull later this year in hopes of producing femaleoffspring that secrete lactoferrin in their milk.   The latest advances with transgenic animals follow theannouncement in June that researchers at closely held DNXCorp. in Princeton, N.J., had genetically altered pigs toproduce human hemoglobin in their blood. The substance, foundin red blood cells, carries oxygen and promises to serve as ablood substitute in transfusions.</TEXT></DOC>
