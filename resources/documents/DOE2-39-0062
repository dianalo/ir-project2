Thesepower cycling tests performed at various power levels and burnups ofup to 25 GWd/t(U) showed that the fuel rod cycling performance compareswell with the performance of fuel rods operated under essentially constantload at comparable power levels. Two additional cycling tests as describedin this paper were performed on the HFR Petten with preirradiated PWRfuel rods having burnups of up to 40 GWd/t(U). These experiments comprisedup to 60 cycles between 250/360 W/cm and 215/320 W/cm with 10% powerovershoot (400, 370 W/cm) after each cycle. Also, these experiments endedup with sound fuel rods. Moreover, detailed investigations before andbetween power cycles and after experiment termination showed clearlythat the fuel performance corresponds to a single ramp to peak powerand that the cycling effects are indeed very small. This confirmed earlierfindings that due to crack reversal in the UO/sub 2/ the cyclic dimensionalchanges mainly occur in the UO/sub 2/ itself. Altogether the experimentsshow that power cycling does not lead to fuel rod failures, which isalso confirmed by successful load follow operation in commercial powerplants.</TEXT></DOC>
