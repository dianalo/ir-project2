The soot concentration in the chamber duringthe final stage of combustion at the highest pressure was measured bythe in situ laser extinction method. Patterns of soot formation withthe passage of time varied according to different temperatures of gascombustion, and a peak was observed which seemed to be the PAH formedat the early stage of soot formation at high temperatures. Turbulentburning yielded less soot than laminar combustion because of higher combustiontemperature of gas caused by the decrease in heat loss. It was foundthat the soot yield was influenced by the pressure and temperature andnot by the oxygen concentration. It was also made clear that the sootyield in lower temperatures rised sharply with increasing pressure, butthe dependence of pressure gets weaker with higher temperature.
