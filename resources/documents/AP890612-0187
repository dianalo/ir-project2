Over large tracts of Vinh Phu, experimental efforts are under wayto regenerate forests that once covered most of the hilly provinceand to persuade farmers to mix cash crops with trees that bind andfertilize the soil.   The lessons learned may help attain a national objective:increase tree cover in the next few decades from the current 20percent to 50 percent. Vo Quy, the country's leadingconservationist, says while the plan may be over-ambitious, notsucceeding could spell disaster.   According to Quy, a biologist who helped develop Vietnam strategyfor national conservation, forces threatening the underpinnings ofVietnam are at work.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Maryland woman dubbed ``Robin HUD'' byfederal investigators claims she embezzled as much as $5.5 millionfrom the Department of Housing and Urban Development to give to thepoor.   HUD Secretary Jack Kemp was described Sunday as being ``veryupset'' by the losses, which according to The Washington Post couldreach $10 million in the Washington field office alone because ofextraordinarily lax bookkeeping involving foreclosure sales ofgovernment property.   Kemp ordered HUD Inspector General Paul Adams to conduct animmediate investigation of the alleged embezzlement in theWashington office and on Friday he placed four employees on leavewithout pay, Frank Keating, HUD's general counsel-designee, said inan interview Sunday.   The New York Times said investigations also were under way in HUDoffices in Denver, Houston, New Orleans and Los Angeles aboutmillion-dollar diversions.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush's proposed savings and loanbailout plan moves to the House floor this week with members of hisown party attacking its key reform and Democrats trying to use it tocreate new housing subsidies.   With the Sandamp;L crisis already expected to cost taxpayers $600 to$1,000 for every man, woman and child in the country, what has beena largely harmonious effort so far could deteriorate into partisanname-calling.   Omens of what might occur when debate begins Wednesday wereevident last week in several confrontations between Democrats andRepublicans, Sun Belt and Frost Belt lawmakers, and populists andindustry sympathizers.   Rep. Dennis Eckart, D-Ohio, said what happens will be the firsttest of bipartisan cooperation since his party lost two of its threetop leaders to ethics problems.</TEXT><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Labor organizers say more and more doctors arejoining the ranks of several unions nationwide _ a trend that couldchange the rules by which medical professionals play.   Before doctors take the lives of others into their hands, theytake a Hippocratic oath to act ``with purity and with holiness,'' amandate that raises ethical questions about whether a doctors'walkout would, say, stop a parent from rushing a sick child pastpickets and into an emergency room.   Still, does that oath deprive doctors of the right to protecttheir own interests, financial and otherwise?   Union proponents and medical ethicists say no _ up to a point.   Dr. Sanford A. Marcus, president of the Union of AmericanPhysicians and Dentists, said his Oakland, Calif.-based consortiumhas 50,000 members and is growing. He said members, affiliatedthrough a number of offshoots around the country, are workingtogether to advocate the rights of both physicians and theirpatients.</TEXT><BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE><TEXT>   Perfect beach weather, you say? A great day to grab your towel,shades, sunblock, the latest best seller and head for sandy shores?   Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the water, avirtual sand trap of rules and regulations awaits, governing suchthings as your oceanside attire, what you pack in your cooler, evenwhether you can toss a Frisbee.   You think Fido might enjoy a romp in the waves? Sorry, but aninformal survey of beach restrictions on both coasts and some inlandbeaches shows that most ban dogs, at least during the summer.   ``Frankly, people just don't want to put their beach blanketsdown next to a pile of deep doo-doo,'' said East Hampton SupervisorTony Bullock on New York's Long Island. Horses are prohibited, too.</TEXT><DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Actress Theresa Saldana's plea helped keepthe man who almost killed her locked up, but, despite publicoutrage, notorious convicts have been freed from California prisons.   Arthur Richard Jackson, who was set for a parole hearingThursday, instead was charged with eight felony counts for allegedlyissuing threats to kill Saldana. Conviction could keep him in prisonfor seven more years, Los Angeles District Attorney Ira Reiner says.   But the ones released form a rogues' gallery familiar to mostGolden State residents, and many people across the country.   There's Lawrence Singleton, who raped a hitchhiker and thenchopped off her forearms with an ax; Ted Streleski, who battered hisStanford University professor to death, then refused to say hewouldn't kill again; and Dan White, released after serving just afew years for the assassinations of San Francisco's mayor andanother politician.</TEXT></DOC>
