Jeff Schaefer, senior vice president at the Securities IndustryAssociation, said inflation pressures and concerns about higherinterest rates had a negative effect on the securities business.   ``In addition to lower volume, there was a lowering ofsecurities prices in both the fixed income and equity markets,''Schaefer said. ``And that's very important, because what determinescommissions and trading profits are security prices.''

Commission revenue amounted to 17.9 percent of total revenues inthe second quarter, down from 18.6 percent in the first quarter,the report said.
