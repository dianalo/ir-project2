The new designated methodis: EQL-0888-068, ``Determination of Lead Concentration in Ambient ParticulateMatter by Inductively Coupled Argon Plasma Optical Emission Spectrometry(State of Rhode Island).'' The applicant's request for an equivalent method determination for theabove method was received on July 15, 1987. Additional requested informationpertinent to the original submittal was received on May 12, 1988. This method has been tested by the applicant, the State of Rhode Island,in accordance with the test procedures prescribed in 40 CFR Part 53. Afterreviewing the results of these tests and other information submitted bythe applicant, EPA has determined, in accordance with Part 53, that thismethod should be designated as an equivalent method. The information submittedby the applicant will be kept on file at EPA's Environmental MonitoringSystems Laboratory, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, and will beavailable for inspection to the extent consistent with 40 CFR Part 2 (EPA'sregulations implementing the Freedom of Information Act). This method uses the sampling procedures specified in the reference methodfor the determination of lead in suspended particulate matter collectedfrom ambient air (43 FR 46258). Lead in the particulate matter is solubilizedby extraction with a mixture of nitric acid and hydrocholoric acid, facilitatedby heat and ultrasonication. The lead content of the sample is analyzedby inductively coupled argon plasma optical emission spectrometry usingthe 220.35 nm lead emission line and instrument conditions optimized bythe user laboratory. A sample of the extract solution is nebulized to forman aerosol which is excited with high temperature argon gas produced bypassing of argon through a powerful radio frequency field. Radiation emittedfrom the plasma enters a spectrometer where it is separated into selectedwavelengths and sensed by separate photomultiplier tubes for each elementof interest. The luminous energy thus measured is converted to an outputsignal which can be related to the concentration of each element of interestin the sample. The analytical system is capable of rapid sequential multi-elementdeterminations. Technical questions concerning the method should be directedto the State of Rhode Island, Department of Health, Air Pollution Laboratory,50 Orms Street, Providence, Rhode Island 02904. As a designated equivalent method, this method is acceptable for use bystates and other control agencies under requirements of 40 CFR Part 58,Ambient Air Quality Surveillance. For such purposes the method must beused in strict accordance with the procedures and specifications providedin the method description. States or other agencies using inductively coupledargon plasma optical emission spectrometric methods that employ proceduresand specifications significantly different from those in this method mustseek approval for their particular method under the provisions of Section2.8 of Appendix C to 40 CFR Part 58 (Modifications of Methods by Users)or may seek designation of such methods as equivalent methods under theprovisions of 40 CFR Part 53. Additional information concerning this action may be obtained by writingto Director, Environmental Monitoring Systems Laboratory, Quality AssuranceDivision (MD-77), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Research TrianglePark, North Carolina 27711. <ITAG tagnum="6">Vaun A.
