HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>STOCKHOLM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   New findings showing that AIDS can betransmitted through breast milk should not deter Third Worldmothers from breast-feeding their babies, experts say.   Six cases of the lethal AIDS virus, called HIV, being spreadthrough breast milk were reported Monday at the FourthInternational Conference on AIDS. But the hazards of bottle-feedingin poor countries are probably higher, some of the scientists said.   ``The benefits of being breast-fed by an HIV-infected motherclearly outweigh the risks in developing countries,'' said Kathy I.Kennedy of Family Health International in Research Triangle Park,N.C.   She and her colleagues conducted a statistical analysis showingthat babies in poor countries are far more likely to die fromdiseases resulting from bottle-feeding than from the possible riskof catching the AIDS virus.   In poor parts of the world, bottle-feeding is often risky, inlarge part because infant formula can be mixed with contaminatedwater.   Researchers from Cornell University Medical College in New Yorkstudied 45 AIDS-infected children in Haiti, where AIDS infectionsare relatively common. They said they found no evidence that any ofthem caught the virus from breast milk.   ``We feel that transmission from breast milk is quite low,''said Dr. John Ho, one of the Cornell researchers. ``On a broadbasis, it is probably not an important factor.''   Experts believe that most babies with AIDS got the infectionfrom their mothers before birth. There is a 25 percent to 50percent risk that an infected mother will pass the virus to herdeveloping child.   The risk of contracting the disease through breast-feeding isprobably substantially greater from mothers infected after birth asopposed to those carrying the virus before conception, said Dr.John Ziegler of Prince of Wales Children's Hospital in Westmead,Australia.   ``Breast-feeding women should be aware that if they becomeinfected, their baby is likely to be infected as well,'' he said.   Ziegler has reviewed nine cases in which breast-feeding womenbecame infected with the AIDS virus after giving birth and foundthat three of their babies caught the virus.   He described two of the cases, while a third in Australia wasreported by Dr. Marion Bucens of Princess Margaret Hospital inPerth.   ``We don't know how often this happens,'' Bucens said. ``In theThird World countries, this is of great importance because of theenormity of heterosexual transmission'' of the AIDS virus. ``Thereare so many women who are infected.''   Ziegler said that for uninfected babies whose mothers had thevirus before they were born, the risk of breast-feeding is probablyrelatively small.   But it appears to be substantially higher if the woman catchesthe virus while she is breast-feeding. This is because she islikely to produce high levels of virus in her breast milk early inthe infection.   One typical case was presented by Dr. Pierre Weinbreck andcolleagues from the Hospital and Medical University of Limoges inFrance.   A 28-year-old woman received a transfusion of AIDS-tainted bloodafter giving birth. She then breast-fed her baby for a month.   Two years later, she developed AIDS, and her child was alsofound to be infected.   Two other cases were reported by Dr. Robert L. Colebunders fromMama Yemo Hospital in Kinshasa, Zaire. In one of them, a babycaught the virus from an AIDS-infected wet nurse.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immunesystem, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infectionsand cancers. It is is most often transmitted through sexual contact.   Other means of transmission include transfusions of taintedblood or blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermicneedles or syringes by drug abusers.</TEXT></DOC>
