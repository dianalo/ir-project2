By contrast, Ford Motor Co.'s hourly workers probably will receive more than $3,000 each from that company's profit-sharing plan, sources familiar with the two auto makers' profit-sharing formulas said. Last year, Ford workers got profit-sharing checks averaging $2,100, while GM workers got nothing.    Ford's earnings in the first nine months of this year were 48% ahead of a year earlier. Meanwhile, GM's U.S. auto operations apparently haven't produced enough profit to trigger bonus payments, a United Auto Workers union official said.    Company officials declined to comment, saying any profit-sharing estimates are purely speculative until the companies compute their year-end results. </TEXT></DOC>
