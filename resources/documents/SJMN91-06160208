The A's also held an 8-4 edge in the 1990 seasonseries.;    So it figures that Friday night's 3-1 victory over the A's took ona greater meaning for the Red Sox, who also stopped a season-high five-gamelosing streak in the process.;    &quot;For so many years we just haven't playedwell here,&quot; Boston left fielder Mike Greenwell said. &quot;Then we get into theplayoffs and we're intimidated here. We need to show that we're not scared andshow we can beat this team here. We need to earn respect from them.;   &quot;There's a chance it'll be us and them again in this year's playoffs. So it'sespecially important for us to play well here.&quot;;    The Red Sox, who moved towithin a half-game of A.L. East leader Toronto, a 6-4 loser to Baltimore, usedGreg Harris to avert their longest losing streak since last July. Harris, whohad been relegated to the bullpen May 17, pitched six innings for the victory.The right-hander allowed four hits and struck out three. Harris' last sixappearances have been in relief. It was the first time in four starts thatHarris (2-5) lasted past the fifth inning. His other victory came April 20against Cleveland.;    &quot;He had some nice pop on his fastball,&quot; A's ManagerTony La Russa said. &quot;By the time he was becoming vulnerable, (Red Sox ManagerJoe) Morgan got him out of there.&quot;;    Jeff Gray pitched two perfect inningsof relief, followed by Jeff Reardon, who retired all three batters in theninth to earn his 15th save.;    Jody Reed had the key hit for the Red Sox, atwo-run double in the second inning to give Boston a 2-1 lead. The A's tookthe lead when Dave Henderson hit his major league-leading 14th home run in thefirst.;    Boston added its final run in the fifth when Carlos Quintana scoredon a sacrifice fly by Greenwell, who also made a spectacular over-the-shouldercatch in the fourth off Mike Gallego's drive to the left-field wall that wouldhave assuredly scored two runs and given the A's a 3-2 lead at the time.;   Most of the A's thoughts were still with shortstop Walt Weiss, who is expectedto be out until late September after he severely tore ligaments in his leftankle while running out a grounder Thursday afternoon.;    Before Weiss'injury, relief pitcher Joe Klink suffered a broken right foot when Milwaukee'sDante Bichette hit a line drive off the foot. Klink is expected to be out atleast six weeks.;    After the recent rash of injuries, there was finally somegood news for the A's. Catcher Terry Steinbach, who was hit in the head lastSaturday in Chicago and suffered a concussion, returned to action for thefirst time since the beaning. He replaced starter Troy Afenir behind the platein the eighth inning.;  HOW THEY SCORED;    A's 1st -- With two out,D.Henderson homered. A's 1, Red Sox 0 .;    Red Sox 2nd -- Burks walked.
