EC estimates that oil price proceeds as it is,up to 1995 but when efforts to save energies or to investigate and exploitoil resorces are neglected, the supply may be tight in the early stage.USSR is the largest oil and gas reserving country in the world and enlarginggas production but there are many problems in oil reserves and the exploitingtechnology. Norway is not large oil producing country in the world butoccupies 41% of oil and of 48% gas production in Europe and the tradebalance depends on these productions. The production lowering may beavoidable in the NOrth Sea oil field of in the UK because of the presentlow price and the UK may be changed to a oil importing country in theend of this century.
