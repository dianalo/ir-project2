Harris Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP BA GEAIRLINES (AIR)AEROSPACE (ARO) </IN><TEXT>   Air France ordered 16 Boeing Co. 747-400 jumbo jets and took options for 12 more in a $3.5 billion package that is the second largest ever for the Seattle-based aerospace concern.    The transaction, which totals about $2 billion for the 16 planes ordered, confirms plans announced by the French airline in January. Yesterday, Air France arranged to take delivery of the 747s from 1991 through 1996. The airline currently flies 33 ofthe other models of the 747.    The Air France planes will be powered by General Electric Co. CF6-80C2 engines, Boeing said.    Confirmation of the 747 purchase brings the total number of commercial aircraft ordered from Boeing this year to 347, six more than were ordered in all of 1986. Last year's $19.2 billion value of the total orders, however, still exceeds this year's $18.9 billion, reflecting the greater number of higher-priced 747s that the world's airlines purchased in 1986.    It was during that year that British Airways reached a 747-400 order-option agreement with Boeing valued at a total of $4.1 billion. That order, Boeing's largest, also involved 16 firm purchases and 12 options, but included arrangements for spare parts and training that weren't a part of yesterday's Air France transaction.    Frank Shrontz, Boeing president, signed the contract with Air France President Jacques Friedmann early yesterday in Paris. Air France also has announced plans to acquire A-340 aircraft from Airbus Industrie, the European consortium. The A-340 is a long-range jetliner similar to the 747-400, but it is smaller and isn't scheduled to be available to airlines as early as the Boeing plane.    Boeing said it now has taken orders for a total of 117 of the 747-400s from 17 airlines. The first 747-400 is scheduled to roll off the production line Jan. 26 to begin a 10-month flight test program.    Boeing shares closed yesterday at $37.50, up 75 cents, and GE at $46.625, up $1.125, both in New York Stock Exchange composite trading. </TEXT></DOC>
