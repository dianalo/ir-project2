But the country's often byzantine and sometimes corruptregulatory climate, though improving rapidly, still imposesmany obstacles, according to analysts who attended aconference on Vietnam in New York this month. It wassponsored by the Institute for International Research and TheAsian Wall Street Journal Weekly.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Until recently, the word `contract' was not known inVietnam,&quot; said Ngo Ba Thanh, who heads the VietnameseNational Assembly's Law Commission. &quot;And arbitration needs anew name,&quot; she added. &quot;Before, it has been used to decideaccording to the whim of the {Communist} Party.&quot;   Many analysts believe the U.S. trade embargo on Vietnamwill end within a year, opening up a market of 67 millionpeople, numerous natural resources and a relativelyinexpensive labor force. Taking advantage of thoseopportunities, however, requires homework and anunderstanding of the potential problems with the country'slegacy of communist regulations and anti-business attitudes,analysts say.   Before the past few years, &quot;capitalism was linked toimperialism and colonialism. So was law,&quot; said Jerome Cohen,a lawyer and professor at New York University. That attitudemakes it hard for Vietnamese &quot;to shift gears&quot; and honorcontracts, he said.   But the government is working to make the shift, Mr. Cohensaid. In terms of legislation regarding contracts andinvestment, &quot;Vietnam has done a tremendous job,&quot; he said.   Ms. Thanh, who studied law at New York's ColumbiaUniversity, cited examples of the progress. &quot;For the firsttime in history, the constitution has two articles related toforeign investors,&quot; she said. &quot;The state guarantees thattheir capital, profits and assets are protected by law andare not going to be nationalized.&quot;   That may seem a basic step, but it is a big one forVietnam, which is trying to accomplish capitalist economicreforms similar to those China began making more than adecade ago. &quot;Those who've been dealing with China may befeeling very at home in Vietnam,&quot; Mr. Cohen said.   But the Chinese experience also shows there could beproblems with enforcement of contracts. &quot;What if you win yourcase, and the other side doesn't carry it out?&quot; Mr. Cohenasked, pointing out that this has sometimes been a problem inChina.   Another potentially troubling similarity to China is theconflict that can occur between local and nationalauthorities. Local Vietnamese officials have been known toignore national directives and gum up investment projects, orto ask for bribes in exchange for allowing business to beconducted.   &quot;A Confucian notion says that heaven is high and theemperor is far away,&quot; Mr. Cohen said. &quot;There is a stronglocal tradition and a good deal of local autonomy. You haveto be clear about making peace between the local and thecentral governments.&quot;   Some localities are more at ease with capitalism thanothers. &quot;Vietnam is still two countries -- North and South,&quot;said a Western official based in the country. The South, withits lively commerce centered on Ho Chi Minh City, &quot;isdeveloping very rapidly,&quot; he said, while the people of theNorth are &quot;trained to withstand poverty; they're used to it.&quot;   Western investors also need to have concrete notions abouttheir goals before taking on local partners. &quot;Many Vietnamesebelieve a foreign investor is someone who is going to givethem dollars, cars and trips abroad&quot; without anything inexchange, said Jean-Marc Bonnamy, director of the UnitedNations Industrial Development Organization in Vietnam. &quot;Theyhave no concept of economy.&quot;   Many of these problems can be avoided or eased with clearcontracts, Mr. Cohen said. He suggested putting the contractin two languages, and deciding beforehand which version willprevail in the event of a dispute. &quot;Negotiation is really thekey,&quot; he said.   Ms. Thanh added that before signing, the parties alsoshould agree on which legal system will be used. &quot;Decidewhich law is going to prevail: Vietnam's, yours or a thirdcountry's,&quot; she said.   Most important, Mr. Cohen said: &quot;You have to know yourpartners. Who their connections are, their local ties andfamily ties. And try to get to know the local government andthe party people.&quot;   Finally, would-be investors need to dig hard to find outabout the companies they want to invest in. &quot;There isn't muchin the way of corporate reports or things we're accustomedto, so you have to ask lots of people,&quot; Mr. Cohen said.   One hurdle investors aren't likely to face is resentmenttoward Americans in the aftermath of the Vietnam War, saidMr. Bonnamy. The Vietnamese people &quot;are very enthusiastic&quot;about Americans, he said. &quot;The latest chic is to wear a khakivest that says `U.S. Army' on it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
