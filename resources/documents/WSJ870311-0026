The bank also said it was seeking $423 million in fresh capital from shareholders through a rights issue.    The increase in profit was slightly higher than expected by financial analysts and marked the first time since 1982 that Hongkong Bank has reported double-digit profit growth.    After a massive campaign of global expansion, Hongkong Bank is in need of additional capital. Hongkong Bank's new chairman, William Purves, said that without the funds, the bank's capital would fall below a level he wanted to maintain.    In the $423 million rights issue, shareholders will be offered one new share for every eight they hold. The new shares will be offered at 90 cents each, compared with a closing price of $1.32 on the Hong Kong stock market yesterday.    Despite its global diversification, the bank still depends heavily on Hong Kong for its earnings. The profit rise was in line with that of other leading banks in the colony, pointing to a recovery for the local banking industry since the second half of last year, analysts said.    Mr. Purves said that conditions in 1986 were difficult in Singapore, with bad-debt provisions needed for the second year running. In Malaysia, too, the bank had to provide for bad debts.    Hongkong Bank still is seeking expansion through the acquisition of a bank in Europe to complete its global network. Mr. Purves said a takeover target in Europe has yet to be identified. </TEXT></DOC>
