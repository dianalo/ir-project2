(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>WordPerfect Language PackandM;The major word processors have all been available in different languageversions for some years now.andP;  However, we rarely see attempts to sell foreignlanguage word processors, spell checkers or thesauri in the UK.andM;WordPerfect UK has recently repackaged its foreign language dictionaries asseparate Language Packs, probably with a view ahead to 1992.andM;The Language Packs are add-ons to WordPerfect 5.0, and include a spellchecker, a thesaurus and a hyphenation unit.andP;  They're available in a numberof different languages including French, German, Spanish, Italian,Catalonian, Danish, Dutch, Icelandic, Norwegian, Portuguese, Swedish andSwiss German.andM;I'm in the process of translating a 15-page peripheral manual into fourdifferent European languages.andP;  The actual translations were made by nationalsof the countries concerned, but then retyped by typists whose first languageis English.andM;The WordPerfect spell checkers were used to check the French and Germanversions of the manual before returning the typescript to the translator forproof reading.andM;Each spell checker contains two files, one small control file and onedictionary file with an extension .LEX, and is provided on both 5 1/4-inchand 3 1/2-inch disk formats.andP;  These are then copied on to your mainWordPerfect directory.andM;The spell checkers can't be used without an existing copy of WordPerfect.andP;  Noinstructions accompanied the spell checkers received for review, but settingthem up and using them wasn't difficult.andP;  Each spelling dictionary usesaround 300Kb, so you need a good deal of space on your hard disk to have fourlanguages on line at the same time.andM;On my copy of WordPerfect, UK English is the default language, so thelanguage used on the two manual drafts had to be changed.andP;  This isaccomplished in a similar way to changing the page size or margin settings.andM;Using the French spell checker successfully reduced the number of errors byabout 50 per cent.andP;  It was particularly useful for spotting missing accents.andM;The German spell checker, used on the same document, was of no practical use.andO;It didn't seem to recognize the genitive case of words with which it washappy in the nominative, or recognize compound nouns made from nouns which itdid recognize.andP;  In English, this would be equivalent to recognizing 'run' butnot 'running' or recognizing 'word' and 'processor' but not 'wordprocessor'.andM;Of course, few English spell checkers would recognize 'wordprocessor' fromknowing the two parts of the word, but the German language needs this abilitymuch more.andP;  The attempt to use the German spell checker was soon abandoned,as it questioned so many words that turned out to be correct.andM;WordPerfect quotes the vocabulary of its UK English dictionary as 115,000words.andP;  The French dictionary holds about 115,000 words and manages toprovide some useful corrections.andP;  The German dictionary's offering of 130,000words, however, doesn't really seem enough to be useful.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
