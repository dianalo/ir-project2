SeibStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 07/29/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ELECTRIC, ELECTRONICS, APPLIANCES (ELE)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan announced a package of government steps designed to help the private sector develop commercial applications of new electrical superconducting materials.    The package, which he summarized in a speech at a conference here on superconductivity, includes proposed legislation to allow more joint ventures under federal antitrust law and plans for shifting more federal research funds into superconductivity projects.    Recently discovered superconducting materials transmit electricity without resistance, allowing electrical currents to be carried without loss of energy over great distances. Compared with superconductors already in use, the new materials work at higher temperatures that are cheaper to attain. They have a wide variety of potential applications -- in computers, medical devices and electronics -- but are still in the research phase, and major commercial uses are expected to be at least several years away.    Several of the administration's proposed steps are modifications of earlier initiatives to promote commercial use of high technology in general, announced by President Reagan in his State of the Union address in January. Some, notably a proposal to protect some technical information from release under the Freedom of Information Act, haven't made much progress in Congress. But by focusing attention specifically on the popular superconductivity issue, the administration may hope the ideas have a greater chance of success on Capitol Hill.    White House aides stressed that their aim is to ensure that American manufacturers, rather than Japanese or European competitors, take the lead in commercial development.    Mr. Reagan warned that &quot;for the promise of superconductivity to become real, it must bridge the gap from the laboratory to the marketplace, it must make the transition from a scientific phenomenon to an everyday reality, from a specialty item to a commodity.&quot;    Specifically, Mr. Reagan said he will:    --Seek legislation to ease antitrust laws governing joint production ventures; increase patent protection for manufacturing processes, and authorize federal agencies to withhold from release under the Freedom of Information Act some commercially valuable technical information.    --Establish an advisory group of industry and academic experts to advise the administration.    --Encourage federal agencies to shift funds in existing budgets into superconductivity research and order them to emphasize such research in budgets for the next two fiscal years.    --Ask the Defense Department to speed up work on military applications and the Commerce Department to accelerate development of other devices.    --Direct the Patent and Trademark Office to speed processing.    --Negotiate more American opportunities to participate in Japanese government-supported research and development. </TEXT></DOC>
