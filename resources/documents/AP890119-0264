The Census Bureau estimated the population at 246,879,546 as ofJan. 1 of this year. When Reagan took office in 1981, it stood at230,138,000.   That means an increase of 16,741,546 people in eight years. Or apopulation growth of 5,749 people-a-day under the Reaganadministration.   Just as well, because the extra wage earners will be needed tohelp pay a national debt which grew sharply over the period, risingfrom $994 billion in 1981 to an anticipated $2.87 trillion by theend of this year.</TEXT><DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Violence in black neighborhoods ebbed Thursday asofficials estimated riot damage to buildings at less than $1 millionand the community began examining the underlying causes of theuprising.

Although the rise in the Labor Department's Consumer Price Indexlast year was identical to the 1987 gain, the reasons were verydifferent.   The summer drought pushed food prices up by 5.2 percent in 1988,compared with 3.5 percent a year earlier. Last year's gain was thesteepest since 1980. Consumers got a break on energy costs, whichrose a scant 0.5 percent, compared with 8.2 percent in 1987.   The inflation rate excluding the volatile food and energycatagories _ a compilation many economists say is a better gauge ofunderlying inflationary pressure than the larger index _ didaccelarate, from 4.2 percent in 1987 to 4.7 percent last year.</TEXT><DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Riot police beat protesters withclubs Thursday and formed human cordons to drive 2,000 people fromWenceslas Square, where activists demanding more human rights haverallied five straight days.

What happened on his fifth mercy mission remains a mystery, butother Western hostages freed since he vanished have reported seeinga man in an underground prison they believed was the 6-foot-7 Waite.

The finding is the first direct evidence linking cigarettes andheart disease, said an editorial accompanying the study in Friday'sJournal of the American Medical Association.   The data indicated smokers were more likely than non-smokers tohave angina, or chest pains, and painless periods of inadequateblood flow to the heart, both called ischemic episodes, theresearchers said.   These episodes lasted longer among smokers, whose median episodewas 24 minutes compared to 2 minutes for non-smokers, the studysaid. Both frequency and duration increased as the number ofcigarettes increased, the study said.</TEXT><DATELINE>CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President P.W.
