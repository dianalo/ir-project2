Babies, of course, can't recite letters on a chart. So while doctors can easily check for gross defects in an infant's eyeball and visual responses, they can't find out whether eye-brain connections are developing properly.    To overcome the problem, scientists at Massachusetts Institute of Technology are capitalizing on the fact that babies find some patterns visually arresting. In one test, they show infants two circles on a TV-like screen, one with lines that wiggle and the other with stationary lines. The babies usually watch the wigglers.    In repeated tests of a few seconds each, the researchers alternate the wiggling side and gradually smooth the wiggles so they are less perceptible. The point at which a baby quits focusing on the wiggling side indicates his or her visual acuity.    The researchers have devised different patterns to test various aspects of infant vision, such as depth perception and the ability to detect slight misalignments of overlapping lines, which is one of the first visual powers to develop.    Among other insights, they have found that girls develop depth perception before boys do, says brain researcher Richard Held, who is leading the research.    The team is developing a computerized system for detecting problems, such as severe astigmatism in one eye, which can cause permanent damage if not corrected early. &quot;It's a pain in the neck to put glasses on babies, but it can be done,&quot; Mr. Held says.    'Bored to Distraction'    May No Longer Be Apt    IF YOU FIND this article boring, don't blame us -- maybe you're just distracted.    At least, that's what one might conclude from a study on boredom by two psychologists at Clark University in Worcester, Mass.    The researchers enlisted 91 volunteers to listen separately to a tape-recorded article from &quot;Psychology Today.&quot; Meanwhile, a TV soap opera blared in the next room to distract the subjects, who weren't told the noise was part of the experiment.    More than half of those who found the background noise moderately distracting said the article was a yawner. In contrast, most of those who either weren't distracted or were very distracted didn't.    The researchers, James Laird and Robin Damrad-Frye, concluded that the moderately distracted people subliminally noticed their minds were wandering and interpreted that as boredom. Very distracted subjects didn't feel bored because, although their minds wandered, they recognized that the noise was responsible.    The study supports the idea that feelings spring from unconscious perceptions of one's own behavior or thoughts, says Mr. Laird. That idea also might explain other studies suggesting that people can induce positive feelings in themselves by smiling.    The boredom study, reported in this month's issue of the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, may have practical implications, Mr. Laird says. &quot;Most offices are designed to lower distractions,&quot; he explains. &quot;But the distractions often may be kept just low enough to cause the worst case for boredom.&quot; Still, he concedes, some things are just plain dull, regardless of distractions.    Scientists Latch On    To Leech Technology    JUST WHEN THE LEECH is making a comeback in medicine, biotechnology may come up with products that would send it back to the swamp.    The worms long ago were prescribed for sucking out &quot;bad blood.&quot; Then they were shunned as medieval. But lately they have regained some lost favor. In Boston, leeches were applied to a boy's ear that had been reattached after a dog bite. The leeches drained blood that couldn't pass through the ear's damaged blood vessels, preventing blood clots for a few days while the vessels healed.    When they feed, the creatures stop blood from clotting with an anticoagulant in their saliva called hirudin. The substance has long tantalized doctors as a potential drug, but only tiny amounts can be gotten from the animals.    Now some 10 companies -- including Biogen Inc. of Cambridge, Mass., and a joint venture between two French concerns, Societe Nationale Elf Aquitaine and Transgene S.A. -- are racing to develop genetically engineered versions of hirudin.    It might be used during dialysis to prevent blood clots in needles and tubes, to preserve donated blood and to help keep blood vessels clear of clots in heart-attack and other patients.    While there are concerns that hirudin could cause strokes or other bleeding problems, Biogen last week reported that in a study with baboons, a drug it derived from hirudin blocked venous blood clots without increased risk of bleeding. Biogen said the study suggests the drug may be safer than widely used anticoagulants.    Odds and Ends    BIG BIRTHMARKS on children were replaced by Boston researchers, who used small pieces of skin taken from the kids and grown, in the laboratory, into large sheets for grafting. The technique was originated for burn patients, say the researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital and Shriners Burns Institute. . . . A small, cheap sensor to detect leaks of petroleum from underground storage tanks has been developed by scientists at Bell Communications Research Inc. in Livingston, N.J. The sensors could help stem groundwater pollution from some four million fuel storage tanks in the U.S., the company says. </TEXT></DOC>
