The proposedrule for Amendment 1 was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on April 26, 1988 (53 FR 14824). The public commentperiod ended on June 6, 1988.Amendment 1 implements three actions, as described in the following paragraphs.<ITAG tagnum="85">Extension of FMP Coverage to U.S. Pacific Island Possessions</ITAG>When the FMP was first approved in 1980, the planning authority of theCouncil, as defined by the Magnuson Act, did not extend to the EEZ aroundthe U.S. island possessions in the western Pacific, and the FMP managementarea included the EEZ only around Hawaii, Guam, and American Samoa. PublicLaw 97-453, which was enacted in 1983, amended the Magnuson Act to extendCouncil authority to the EEZ around the U.S. Pacific Island possessions.Amemdment 1 formally incorporates the EEZ around the U.S. possessions inthe FMP management area and creates a new exploratory area (X-P-PI) forthe U.S. possessions. This exploratory area will have a 1,000 kg annualharvest quota for all species of precious corals combined. The areas affectedby this action include the EEZ around Johnston Atoll, Kingman Reef andPalmyra, Wake, Jarvis, Howland, and Baker Islands. The new management measuresfor the possessions are consistent with the regulations currently in placefor the other exploratory areas defined in the FMP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Redefinition of the Management Unit Species</ITAG>Amendment 1 extends the definition of precious corals covered under theFMP to include all species of precious corals in the genus <T3>Corallium. </T3>The managment unit defined in the current regulationscover 12 species of coral, three of which are pink (or red) coral in thegenus <T3>Corallium.</T3> The Council determined that this definition is unecessarilyrestrictive in that it fails to recognize present taxonomic uncertaintiesthat surround the recently discovered Midway deepsea coral (<T3>Corallium</T3> sp. nov.), and does not provide automatic FMP managementauthority in the event new species of <T3>Corallium</T3> precious corals are discovered in the EEZ. In orderto manage the fishery while these taxonomic problems are being resolved,the new regulatory definition of precious coral includes all species ofcoral in the genus <T3>Corallium.</T3> Harvest quotas established for the exploratory areasremain unchanged. However, harvests of any new species of <T3>Corallium</T3> will count toward the established quotas.<ITAG tagnum="85">Establishment of an Experimental Fishing Permit (EFP) System</ITAG>The original goal of the FMP was to obtain optimum yield from the preciouscoral fishery in the EEZ by striking a balance among several objectives.These objectives included, among others, (1) encouraging development ofa domestic fishery for precious coral, (2) generating new information neededfor resource management, and (3) preventing overfishing and waste of theresource. the first two objectives have not been achieved.The original FMP established a harvest quota of 1,000 kg of precious coralfor each of the three exploratory areas defined in the FMP. It was believedthat a 1,000 kg quota would provide sufficient incentive to stimulate explorationand discovery of new coral beds.Rather than stimulate exploratory fishing for precious coral, the 1,000kg quota has proven to be too low to justify the financial investmentsrequired by domestic fishermen to explore for and harvest precious coral.There has been no legal fishing for precious coral by domestic or foreignfishermen since the FMP went into effect. The absence of domestic or foreignfishing has prevented the Council and NMFS from obtaining any new informationon precious coral resources which could be used to refine the current managementprogram. Neither State nor Federal fishery research budgets currently areable to finance a research initiative focused on precious coral.To address these problems, the Council proposed the establishment of anexperimental fishing permit (EFP) system. An EFP will allow fishermen toharvest precious coral in exploratory areas above current quota levelsunder tightly controlled conditions to prevent overharvesting. Harvestquotas will be assigned on a case-by-case basis to each vessel fishingunder an EFP at a level that will be related to the cost of undertakingan exploratory fishing venture for precious coral and that will producescientific information needed to better manage the resource. An EFP applicationand review process is established which defines the application requirements,review criteria, and operating conditions which may be attached to an EFPin order to protect precious coral beds. An environmental assessment wouldbe prepared evaluating the potential impacts of fishing under each particularEFP proposed. An opportunity for public comment on EFP applications isprovided. In addition, the Council will develop guidelines for its usein evaluating EFP applications and making recommendations to the RegionalDirector.The Council recognizes the need to increase harvest quotas in the exploratoryareas in order to stimulate domestic fishing and generate information neededfor accurate resource assessment. However, because of limited informationavailable on the size and reproductive condition of precious coral bedsin these areas, the Council was reluctant to propose, and unable to justify,a permanent increase in harvest quotas for exploratory areas. Controlledfishing under an EFP was the preferred alternative to accomplish theseobjectives. Information generated by vessels fishing under an EFP willallow the Council to develop future harvest quotas which are more in linewith resource abundance. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public comments</ITAG>No comments were received during the public comment period.<ITAG tagnum="84">Changes from the Proposed Rule</ITAG>The outdated phrase ``Fishery conservation zone'' and its abbreviation``FCZ'' have been replaced by ``Exclusive economic zone'' and ``EEZ'' bya technical amendment published at 53 FR 24644 on June 29, 1988.In andSection; 680.5, paragraph (a)(3) is deleted because it is not necessarythat fishermen retain fishing logbooks for one year after a copy has beenprovided to NMFS.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The Director, Southwest Region, National Marine Fisheries Service determinedthat this FMP amendment is necessary for the conservation and managementof the precious coral fisheries of the western Pacific region and thatit is consistent with the Magnuson Act and other applicable law.The Council included as environmental review as part of the amendment.An environmental assessment supplementing the environmental review wasprepared on the proposal to include the EEZ around the U.S. Pacific Islandpossessions in the FMP management area. The Council concluded that thisaction would not significantly affect the quality of the environment anddetermined that an environmental impact statement (EIS) was not required.The action to place all species of <T3>Corallium </T3>within the management unit of the FMP was determinedto qualify for categorical exclusion under section 5(c)(3)(a) of NOAA DirectivesManual 02-10, ``Environmental Review Procedures'' (NOAA NEPA Guidelines),because the analysis in the EIS for the original FMP applies to other coralsas well. The action to establish the EFP system under the FMP qualifiesfor a categorical exclusion under section 5(c)(3)(f) of the NOAA NEPA Guidelinesbecause establishing the system in itself does not have any direct impactson the environment. Direct impacts result from actual issuance of EFPS,and a separate EA will be prepared for each EFP considered. The AssistantAdministrator for Fisheries concluded, therefore, that there will be nosignificant impact on the environment as a result of this rule. A copyof the environmental assessment supplementing the Council's environmentalreview may be obtained from NMFS at the above address.Implementation of this rule is not an action that may effect any specieslisted as endangered or threatened under the Endangered Species Act of1972, or the critical habitat of those species. A section 7 consultationwas conducted on the original FMP and concluded that the fishery managedby the FMP did not constitute a threat to threatened or endangered speciesor their habitat. The actions proposed in Amendment 1 are passive withregard to habitat and conventional fishing practices and are not likelyto affect adversely any listed species. Informal consultations betweenthe Council and the Southwest Region were conducted dealing with the amendmentgenerally and with the proposed extension of the management measures tothe Pacific Island possessions specificaly, and it was concluded that theproposed action is not likely to have an adverse effect on any specieslisted as endangered or threatened, nor is it likely to affect any criticalhabitat for such species.The Under Secretary of NOAA determined that this rule is not a ``majorrule'' requiring a regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order 12291.A summary of this determination appears in the proposed rule (53 FR 14824,April 26, 1988) and is based on the regulatory impact review (RIR), whichis included in the Amendment.The Council prepared a regulatory impact review which concludes that thisrule will have positive impact on small business entities. Current FMPregulations and harvest quotas have effectively prevented any domesticfishing for precious coral, particularly in the Hawaii exploratory area.The final rule is expected to provide new harvesting opportunities fordomestice fishermen.The General Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the ChiefCounsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration that this rulewill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall businesses. A summary of this determination appears in the proposedrule.This rule contains a collection of information requirement subject to thePaperwork Reduction Act. The collection of information requirement containedin this rule has been approved by the Office of Management and Budget underControl Number 0648-0196. The logbook collection requirement already containedin Part 680 has been approved under Control Number 0648-0198.The Council has determined that the measures established in the FMP amendmentwill be implemented in a manner that is consistent to the maximum extentpracticable with the approved coastal zone management programs of Hawaii6nd the Territories of American Samoa and Guam. Hawaii has concurred withthe Council's consistency determination for Amendment 1. American Samoaand Guan did not file any objections to the Councils findings within theperiod provided for such comments and did not respond to the Councils requestfor concurrence.This rule does not contain policies with federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of federalism assessment under Executive Order 12612.Because the EFP provision of this rule relieves fishermen wishing to experimentallyharvest precious coral resources from strict quota restrictions, that provision(andSection; 680.10) is not subject to the delayed effectiveness period requiredby the Administrative Procedure Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 680 </ITAG>Fisheries, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: July 15, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
