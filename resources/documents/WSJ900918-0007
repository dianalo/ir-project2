David Ball, assistant secretary for the Labor Department'sPension and Welfare Benefits Administration, said thedepartment's enforcement division has started a study intohow banks get proxy ballots to trustees and whether theprocess gives the shareholders a chance to vote properly. Hesaid he expects the department inquiry to prompt banks toreview their own policies, thus acting as a self-policingmechanism.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;For corporate democracy to work well, persons entitled tovote need to be able to get relevant information in a timelyfashion and to receive their ballots in time to cast them,&quot;Mr. Ball said.   The Labor Department conducted a similar review ofinvestment managers recently to ensure that they weremanaging assets in the interests of plan beneficiaries.   Mr. Ball said the department's regional offices willcontact major banks in their areas to determine whether thebanks are delivering proxies &quot;in a timely fashion&quot; to pensionplan fiduciaries. The department also will be asking aboutthe banks' procedures for determining whether the peoplevoting the shares are the appropriate plan fiduciaries, hesaid.   Mr. Ball also said the Labor Department is considering ameasure that would help beneficiaries determine whetherpension managers have a proxy-voting policy. Currently,participants can find out about the specific plan'sinvestments but can't learn much about whether the plan has abroader policy concerning proxy voting.</TEXT></DOC>
