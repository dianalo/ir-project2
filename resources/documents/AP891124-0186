Eastern warned members of the Air Line Pilots Association andthe attendants' Transport Workers Union they won't necessarily gettheir old jobs back.   ``It is regrettable that they didn't come to this conclusionearlier,'' Eastern spokeswoman Karen Ceremsak said Thursday. ``Theydidn't, so we had to go out and hire permanent replacements.''   The 2,200 striking pilots ended their strike Wednesday, afterPresident Bush vetoed a bill to create a congressional advisorycommittee on Eastern, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcyreorganization five days after the strike began March 4.   The 6,000-member flight attendants' union followed suit laterthat day. That left just the 8,500-member Machinists union, whichbegan the bitter strike.   Union leaders contend that Eastern's bankruptcy, ordered byparent Texas Air Corp., was a tactic to break the unions.   On the picket lines in Atlanta, machinists said they feltabandoned, but were determined to continue what has at times takenon the look of a personal battle between unionists and Texas AirChairman Frank Lorenzo.   ``Everybody out here is pretty much in shock,'' said Steve D.Mack, a striking ramp worker.   Tony Chapman, vice president of the Machinists' Atlanta branch,said his union wouldn't follow the pilots.   ``We will continue,'' Chapman said. ``We started this strike.The pilots acted on their own.''   Members at the union local across the street from Easternheadquarters in Miami chanted, ``Strike! Strike! Strike!'' afterreceiving word of the settlements late Wednesday.   Eastern said it will fight to keep replacement workers hiredduring the strike. Pilots and flight attendants ready to return towork were asked to sign a recall list at Eastern, which said itwould take them back as openings occurred.   Eastern doesn't have jobs for the 2,200 striking pilots, saidMs. Ceremsak. She said Eastern has 1,850 pilots, including 850union members who crossed picket lines, and there are already 100union pilots on a recall list.   The number of openings for flight attendants wasn't immediatelyavailable, but Nancy Currier, vice president of Transport WorkersLocal 553 in Miami, said 1,500 union attendants had crossed picketlines.   The pilots and attendants are prepared to take Eastern to courtto win back jobs, Ms. Currier said.   ``We don't agree with (Eastern's) position and our lawyers don'tagree with their position,'' Ms. Currier said.   The strike began after 1{ years of federally mediated talksbetween Eastern and the Machinists union stalemated over demandsfor $150 million in wage cuts and work-rule changes.   The other unions joined the strike, in part out of the suspicionthat Texas Air, which bought Eastern in 1986, wanted only to bustthe unions and milk cash from Eastern.   Texas Air, which broke strikes and unions at ContinentalAirlines in 1983, infuriated the Eastern unions by spinningEastern's computer reservations system off into a subsidiary andselling its prized Northeast shuttle to Donald Trump.   Lorenzo and other Eastern executives said they had taken over acompany with severe financial problems and unreasonable labor costsand had to make cuts with or without the unions.   Eastern, which operated nearly 1,100 daily flights before thestrike, has said it is rebuilding into an efficient carrier thatwill be up to 90 percent of its pre-strike size when it emergesfrom Chapter 11 next year.</TEXT></DOC>
