Adopted 392-24, the measure trims $100 million from theEnergy Department's fiscal 1992 budget for the atom smasher.But efforts to kill the project failed on a 251-165 roll callthat demonstrated strong bipartisan support for the continuedfederal investment.</LP><TEXT>   The floor action came as a House Appropriationssubcommittee approved a $15.35 billion foreign-aid billincorporating a framework for potential future assistance tothe Soviet Union and providing increased aid for refugees andfor Africa in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1.Population-planning funding would grow to $300 million -- a20% increase over this year -- and include $20 million for aUnited Nation's family planning agency that has been refusedU.S. aid since the mid-1980s because of opposition fromanti-abortionists.   The panel took no action on the Bush administration'srequest for more than $12 billion to fulfill the U.S.obligation to the International Monetary Fund. In addition,the Treasury Department was largely frustrated in itsdebt-relief initiative for Latin American nations. Afterpersonal lobbying by Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, thesubcommittee chairman agreed to $100 million for amultilateral investment fund for the region in which Japan ispledged to participate. But the foreign-aid bill providesonly about a fifth of the $304.3 million requested for debtreduction.   The chief beneficiary of these funds, totaling $65million, is expected to be Jamaica, which aggressivelylobbied behind the Washington firm Neill andamp; Co. and had helpfrom senior Democrats, including Texas Rep. Charles Wilsonand Majority Whip William Gray.   Assistance for Eastern Europe would grow modestly to $400million. But the more far-reaching issue is the question ofaid to the Soviet Union. The bill provides no specificfunding, but in an accompanying report, the panel urges theadministration to &quot;seize the opportunity&quot; to secure reformsfrom Moscow in return for aid.   Divisions remain over what steps will be adequate, but theunderlying message of the report is a call for President Bushto set standards that can open the door to assistance for theSoviet Union. &quot;While the West cannot determine the future ofthe Soviet Union, we must be prepared to respond iflong-awaited Soviet political and radical economic reformsare undertaken,&quot; said the report. &quot;The U.S. government shouldpropose a performance-based framework to facilitate Sovietpolitical and economic reforms and Western economic andtechnical assistance and advice.&quot;   The energy and water bill is the first of the fiscal 1992appropriations measures to pass the House. In line with lastOctober's deficit pact, total spending would grow by only3.2%. Within atomic energy defense accounts, new militaryexpenditures are cut by almost $500 million to help pay forthe cleanup of weapons plants. And even after it is trimmed,the expensive super collider eats up half of what increasethere is on the domestic side of the ledger.   For example, discretionary funds for non-defense accountsin the bill grow by an estimated $377 million over fiscal1991, and $190 million of that goes to pay for the increasedsuper collider budget of $433.7 million. The pressure hadforced the House Appropriations committee to cut $43.5million for a competing high energy physics project at theFermilab in Illinois, but $10 million was restored yesterdayto avoid a floor fight and placate the state's powerfuldelegation.</TEXT></DOC>
