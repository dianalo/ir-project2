But other sources in Israel and Lebanon minimize the importanceof Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid, describing him more as a religiousleader or a ``cheerleader.''   ``If I were to name the 50 Hezbollah leaders who make decisionsin south Lebanon, he (Obeid) would not be on the list,'' said asecurity source in Lebanon, who spoke on condition of anonymity.   Since Obeid's kidnapping Friday, Israeli officials and the mediablamed the 33-year-old sheik for crimes dating to 1983, includingthe kidnapping of U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins, whosedeath was announced Monday.   Obeid has been described by Israeli officials as a ``big fish''and a ``valuable property'' for the possible swap of Israel'sShiite captives for Israeli soldiers and foreign hostages held inLebanon.   The Defense Ministry today said Obeid told interrogators thatHiggins may have been alive last week.   Despite Obeid's statements about Higgins, however, Israelofficially has said it received word months ago that Higgins hadbeen killed.   Obeid has been isolated since his capture and was unaware of thereports Higgins has been killed to avenge his abduction, theDefense Ministry statement said.   No body has been found and there is no way of knowing when thevideotape showing Higgins dangling from a gallows had been made.   An Israeli official also said that during the interrogation,Obeid gave the impression that he was ``afraid'' to be extraditedto the United States.   The Foreign Ministry issued a statement Tuesday blamingHezbollah for killing more than 250 Americans in the 1983 bombingsof a U.S. Marines barracks and U.S. Embassy buildings in Lebanon,more than 70 Frenchmen and dozens of Israelis, and then said ``itis in this context'' that Israel seized Obeid.   In a speech before Parliament on Wednesday, Rabin said Obeid wasHezbollah's leader in southern Lebanon and had been ``a centralfigure ... in everything linked to attacks on Israel and incitementof these.''   Obeid was involved in ``terrorist activities, distributingmoney, transferring weapons, participating in and hiding means ofattacks and above all approving nearly every act Hezbollah carriedout in south Lebanon,'' Rabin said.   He said Obeid admitted under interrogation that ``the planners''of the capture of two soldiers from Israel's self-declared securityzone in southern Lebanon left from Obeid's house to carry out theirattack in February 1986.   In the Higgins case, the three abductors were in Obeid's housethe night before seizing the victim near Tyre, Lebanon, in Feburary1988 and one of them returned there later, Rabin said.   He also said the car used in Higgins' kidnapping in February1988 was later kept hidden in Obeid's garage.   Israel has ``the basis to assume'' Obeid was involved in a carbombing north of Israel's border that killed 12 Israeli soldiers inMarch 1985, Rabin said.   While no one is claiming Obeid is merely a clergyman, sourcesand some Israeli journalists draw a different picture of him.   One source in Lebanon said that Abbas Musawi, not Obeid, was theleader of Hezbollah in southern Lebanon. Musawi was also listed asthe radical group's southern Lebanese head in the English-languageJerusalem Post.   The source, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said Obeid drewhis reputation from Raged Harb, his predecessor as Shiite spiritualleader in the village of Jibchit. Harb, a fiery, anti-Israelipreacher, was assassinated in 1984.   While noting that Israel spoke of Obeid approving terroristacts, the source added that in southern Lebanon ``approving isnothing. ... What matters is who plans it and does it.''   An Israeli source, who also insisted on anonymity, said thedeath threats against hostages that followed Obeid's kidnappingcame only because of Shiite anger at an insult to the Moslem clergy.   He said what little importance Obeid had was diminished when theShiite militia Amal took control of southern Lebanon from Hezbollahin bloody fighting after Higgins' kidnap.   Israeli journalist Uzi Mahaneimi, writing in the daily YediotAhronot, made the same point and quoted Lebanese sources as saying:``Israel will not receive anything for Obeid.''   Mahaneimi wrote that Obeid had been a military commander but wasonly a religious leader after the Amal victory. Another source saidObeid's main source of power was control of a ``martyr's fund'' forfamilies of slain militiamen.   The Israeli source said Obeid's lack of power was evident inthat Israel was able to abduct him easily _ by blowing open hisdoor and killing a bodyguard or neighbor awakened by the blast.   ``If the guy was that important, he would have had some jeepsoutside and some guys on the roof,'' the source said.</TEXT></DOC>
