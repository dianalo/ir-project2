Eaten by Japanese for 1,000 years and once one of the country'scheapest meats, dark red, chewy whale has become increasinglycostly and rare.   That's because of a worldwide commercial whaling ban, imposed atthe behest of the United States and other countries on grounds thatthe mammal of the seas has become an endangered species.   Japanese lovers of whale meat and whaling industry officialsdon't agree.   ``Americans hunted whales for their oil, so it's probably hardfor them to imagine whales as a source of food,'' said Makiko Takaiover a plate of grilled whale at Kujira-ya (Whale Shop). ``I'd stopeating whale if all types were endangered, but I've heard some arestill plentiful.''   Although whale has been consumed for a millenium and 16thcentury documents show Japan's samurai society being served whaleon formal occasions, the Japanese didn't regularly eat whale untilthe lean years after World War II. It then became frequent fare atschool and company cafeterias and steak on the table at home oftenmeant whale steak.   When Japanese whaling was at its peak in the early 1960s, whalesprovided 23 percent of all meat consumed in the country. In 1962Japanese ate a record 226,000 tons, but last year only 25,000 tonswere consumed, including imports from Iceland, according to theJapan Whaling Association.   ``At this rate, we'll probably only be able to stay in businessfor two or three more years,'' said an employee at Kujira-ya. ``Butso far, whale meat is still obtainable.''   That continuing availability of whale meat in Japan, the world'sbiggest whale consumer, has rankled overseas environmentalists, whocharge it is using a loophole in the charter of the InternationalWhaling Commission (IWC) to continue whale hunts, despite thecommission's ban on commercial whaling.   The ban, overwhelmingly passed by the 42-member commission in1982 to allow scientists to study whale populations, went intoeffect in 1986 and is to be re-evaluated in 1990 on the basis ofresearch results.   Japan officially ended its commercial whaling in the Antarcticat the end of the 1986-87 season, when it caught 1,941 whales, andis to end whaling along its own coasts soon.   But this season, three Japanese ships are back in the Antarctic,catching minke whales under a clause in the internationalconvention that allows nations to kill a limited number of whalesfor scientific research.   Nevertheless, the moratorium has dealt Japan's whaling industrya devastating blow. This season, only 400 to 500 Japanese aredirectly employed in whaling, down from about 900 last year, andthe number is likely to decrease by 200 more when Japan halts itscoastal whaling. Last season's catch was valued at less than $100million, small by Japanese fishery standards, officials say.   Unlike the past, when almost all parts of whales were used _ forfood, fertilizer, cosmetics, shoe horns, tennis racket string,fishing rods, crafts or medicines _ the limited supply now makesmost non-food uses economically impractical, Kunio Arai, chief ofthe whaling association, said in an interview.   But as the economic importance of whaling in Japan has declined,the country's resistance to anti-whaling pressure has grown andtoughened.   ``It's not a question of the size of the economic impact, butrather a matter of national pride,'' said Junichiro Okamoto,assistant director of the Fishery Agency's Deep Sea FisheryDivision. ``Why must Japanese listen to Americans saying that wemust stop eating whales just because they want us to? That's liketelling us to stop eating rice.''   If Japan doesn't stick to its principles, he added, ``the UnitedStates will have the misunderstanding that Japan always succumbs toU.S. pressure. That won't lead to mature mutual relations.''   Deepening the gulf between Japan and anti-whaling groups is aprofound difference in their perceptions of the whale, the world'slargest animal. While environmental groups stress the uniqueness ofwhales, including their large, highly developed brains andcommunication ability, many Japanese see their meat as a normalsource of protein.   At one time, Japanese Buddhism forbade the eating of animalmeat, but made an exception for whales, which were officiallycategorized then as fish.   ``When meat dishes were first widely introduced to Japan fromthe West in the 19th century, many Japanese probably felt the sameway toward beef as Westerners now feel toward the eating ofwhales,'' said Junko Miyamoto, a school secretary.   ``How can someone judge that it's okay to eat cows and pigs butnot whales?'' she asked, referring to current U.S. pressure onJapan to increase its imports of foreign beef. ``The United Statesis trying to impose its own values on others.''   It was partly the U.S. whaling industry's pursuit of new whalinggrounds after the depletion of the northern Atlantic that broughtCommodore Matthew Perry's ``black ships'' to Japan in 1853,demanding access to Japanese ports for provisions and care forshipwrecked sailors.   ``The United States killed whales because of economic demand,''said the Japan Whaling Association's Arai. ``At that time nobodysaid anything about whales being cute and intelligent. But now,after Americans have ended whaling, they're using those reasons totell us to stop.''   In February, the U.S. government declared that Japan's continuedwhaling was harming international whaling agreements. Under twoU.S. anti-whaling laws, it imposed a symbolic cut of 50 percent inJapan's fishing quota in U.S. waters _ already set at zero for thisyear _ and now must decide whether to ban the import of Japaneseseafood.   Meanwhile, the Japanese whalers in the Antarctic are hoping toprove that sufficient stocks exist to allow the resumption oflimited whaling in 1990. The vessels are supposed to sail alongfixed routes and kill only one minke whale in each group sighted,up to a total of 300, to study their health, age and diet.   ``Conservation groups project a single image of whales, eventhough there are many kinds, some of which are endangered andothers of which are not,'' Arai said. ``The IWC estimates there areabout 430,000 minke whales in the Antarctic, and the number isgrowing.''   Japanese whaling officials contend that the commission, nowdominated by non-whaling countries, hasn't shown it is seriousabout carrying out a thorough research program.   ``If by 1990 there's no sign of a comprehensive survey, thenthere's little reason for Japan to stay in the IWC,'' Okamoto said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, April 10</NOTE></DOC>
