(``Phlx'') filedwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (``Commission'') a proposedrule change revising the Philadelphia Stock Exchange Automated Communicationand Execution System (``PACE'') limit order execution criteria. The Commissionpublished notice of the proposal on August 14, 1989, in Securities ExchangeAct Release No. 27141, 54 FR 34847. No comments were received regardingthe proposal.The PACE system provides to Phlx member organizations a cost efficient,competitive order delivery and execution system for public customer orders.In the years prior to 1983, the PACE system was considered to be a systemfor the delivery and execution of small orders, <T3>e.g., </T3>1 to 599 shares.On May 17, 1983, the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'') approveda Phlx rule change (SR-PHLX-83-5) which permitted use of PACE computerfacilities to enable member organizations to electronically transmit, directlyto the specialist post, orders in issues and of order size designated bythe specialist, with a minimum order size of 600 shares.On September 17, 1986, the SEC approved a Phlx rule change (SR-PHLX-86-30)which increased PACE order size eligibility from 599 to 1099 shares. Ordersup to 599 shares continued to be executed in accordance with Phlx Rule229. Orders of 600 to 1099 shares were not subject to the execution parametersof Rule 229 and such orders were executed in accordance with other applicablerules of the Phlx.On May 19, 1988, the SEC approved a Phlx rule change (SR-PHLX-87-30) whichprovided for a professional execution for limit orders of 600 shares orgreater routed to specialists over PACE as well as guidance to Phlx specialists,by identifying the types of trades that constitute a professional executionof this class of limit orders. Such standards imposed a number of tradingobligations upon Phlx specialists when executing PACE limit orders of 600shares or more.By specifying the execution standards set forth in SR-PHLX-87-30, the Exchangeprovided for increased consistency in the execution of limit orders onthe floor and, at the same time, provided notice to PACE users of the kindof execution they can expect for larger limit orders delivered over thePACE system. Such standards are reflected in Commentary .10(b) of PhlxRule 229.The purpose of the instant proposed rule change is to simplify and improvethe standards approved on May 19, 1988, based upon experience gained duringthe approximately one year of their use. Under the proposed rule change,both market and limit orders up to 599 shares will continue to be executedin accordance with the current provisions of Rule 229 and its accompanyingCommentary .01 through and including .10(a).Prior to this amendment, paragraph .10(b) dealt only with orders deliveredafter the opening. The present proposal adds a standard of guaranteeingthe opening price on orders entered at least three (3) minutes prior tothe opening. In the case of orders received by the specialist less thanthree (3) minutes prior to the opening, a reasonable effort will be madeto execute such orders at the opening price.The standard under Circumstance 1 has been amended to delete referenceto the New York market since both New York and American Stock Exchangeissues are traded through PACE. The reference to New York caused confusion.Thus Phlx changed the reference to ``primary market.'' In addition, referenceto execution of marketable limit orders has been deleted because such standardapplies to all orders, whether or not delivered through the PACE systemand, therefore, it is confusing and redundant.Circumstance 2 has been broadened to include a limit order price whichis outside the PACE quote when received by the specialist. Under the revisedrule, when the limit order price is away from (<T3>i.e., </T3>outside) the PACE quote when received by the specialistor when the limit order price is on the PACE quote when received by thespecialist, after ascertaining the primary market quotation size (``referencequote''), the specialist would be obligated to execute the limit orderwhen the primary market prints a trade that is equivalent to the limitprice and aggregates to the size of the reference quote.Old Circumstance 3, which dealt with a limit order price which is outsidethe PACE quote when received by the specialist, has been deleted in itsentirety and such orders have been included in the execution criteria ofCircumstance 2. The previously established standard for execution of thistype of order was confusing and difficult to administer. The new executioncriteria improves and simplifies executions and provides better serviceto retail users of the PACE system. New Circumstance 3 has been established to afford specialists the opportunityto seek execution of orders in other markets by means of the IntermarketTrading System (``ITS''). By the terms of Phlx rules, members must avoidtrading through a superior bid or offer of another market which is an ITSparticipant. In order to avoid such an occurrence, a Phlx specialist maychoose to send a commitment to trade to such other market against the superiorbid or offer. Since the receiving market has up to two (2) minutes to respondto the commitment, at least that much time is required of the Phlx specialistto make such effort and receive a response prior to the close. Old Circumstance 4, which dealt with a limit price traded through by atransaction reported on a market eligible to compose the PACE quote, hasbeen deleted in its entirety because such standard applies to all orderswhether or not delivered through the PACE system and, therefore, is confusingand redundant. New Circumstance 4 provides that execution of an order under the conditionsset forth in this proposal will not breach the existing primary markethigh or low. In other words, the order will be executed at or within theprimary market high-low range existing at time of execution. Equity specialists and member organizations may choose to participate intrading on the PACE system or they may choose not to do so. To the extenta specialist chooses to accept orders through the PACE system as describedherein, such orders are entitled to an execution under the terms of theproposed rule. Phlx stated that because each stock has unique depth, liquidity, volatilityand other trading characteristics, not every stock may be suitable fora program involving execution of larger orders on the basis of predeterminedexecution criteria. Because of this, and in the interest of administrativeease, the Phlx rules will permit specialists to choose to participate inthe program and will permit them to establish an order eligibility sizeof either 2500 shares or 5000 shares on a stock-by-stock basis. Ordersup to either size will be executed under the terms of the proposed rule.Except under unusual circumstances, the specialist must remain committedto his order size eligibility elections for at least six months therebyproving stability and continuity to the list of issues in the program.The Rules provide, however, that under exceptional or extraordinary circumstances,the Floor Procedure committee may grant a specialist's withdrawal fromthe program. The Commission believes that the proposal will lead to increased consistencyin the overall execution of limit orders on the Exchange. The proposalwill also facilitate the oversight of specialist performance and give investorsadequate notice of how their orders will be executed. The Commission therefore finds that the proposed rule change is consistentwith the requirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunderapplicable to the Phlx and, in particular, section 6(b)(5) of the Act inthat it will promote just an equitable principles of trade, facilitatetransactions in securities and protect investors and the public interest.<T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Actthat the proposed rule change be, and hereby is, approved.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuantto delegated authority, 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 3, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
