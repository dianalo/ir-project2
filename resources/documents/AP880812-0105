Thornburgh took the oath of officetoday as the nation's 76th attorney general, declaring the UnitedStates must consider drugs and drug-trafficking ``Public Enemy No.1.''   With President Reagan standing at his side in the Roosevelt Roomof the White House, Thornburgh said he would use ``every resourceof the Department of Justice, consistent with strict observance ofthe civil rights and civil liberties of all our citizens, to fightother unique threats to our traditional values.''   But he said, ``I believe that unless we sustain a vigorouseffort to make drug trafficking and drug abuse Public Enemy No. 1,we could well stunt significantly the capacity of today's youngpeople to contribute to a better quality of life for tomorrow'sAmerica.''   Shortly after his confirmation by the Senate Thursday,Thornburgh said he was not counting on keeping the job if GeorgeBush becomes president.   ``I look on this as a six-month assignment,'' Thornburgh saidafter an 85-0 vote confirmed him as successor to the controversialEdwin Meese III.   The oath of office was administered to Thornburgh by SupremeCourt Justice Antonin Scalia. Bush attended the swearing-inceremony. Thornburgh's wife, Virginia, held the Bible while he saidthe oath.   The former GOP Pennsylvania governor said in a televisioninterview, aired in Philadelphia, that he'll ``let the future takecare of itself'' even if Vice President Bush is elected.   Thornburgh, 56, already has told senators that he's a loyalistto President Reagan, declaring last week, ``His agenda is myagenda.''   Last week, Thornburgh said that fighting the ``scourge ofnarcotics'' would be his top priority, but he also promised avigorous battle against organized crime, public corruption andwhite-collar crime.   Thursday, he said ``every day'' of his potentially short tenure``will be important, because the process of law enforcement is a24-hour-a-day, seven-day a week, year-round proposition and I'manxious and enthusiastic about getting on the job.''   Thornburgh likely will be able to concentrate solely ondepartment programs, unlike Meese, who spent considerable timedefending his personal conduct.   Meese's ethical behavior was investigated by Independent CounselJames McKay, who concluded that the attorney general ``probably''broke the law. Meese consistently denied that, and maintained thatthe department was running normally despite defections by top aidesduring his final months as attorney general.   Three other nominees for top Justice Department positions wereless fortunate Thursday than Thornburgh, as the Senate quit for thesummer without acting on them. Several senators used parliamentarymaneuvering to block action unless the Senate first took uplegislation to enforce a treaty against genocide. The genocidelegislation was not considered.   The lack of action, however, is not likely to have a majoreffect on department operations since all three already are servingin acting capacities: Harold Christensen as deputy attorneygeneral; Francis A. Keating II as associate attorney general; andEdward S.G. Dennis Jr. as chief of the criminal division.   ``We almost worked out something, but at the last moment we wereunsuccessful,'' said Senate Republican leader Bob Dole, R-Kan. TheSenate likely will vote on the three in September.   Thornburgh was supported enthusiastically by Meese's sharpestcritics. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., attempted to paint acontrast between the two men.   He said Meese attempted ``to roll back decades of progress incivil rights,'' gave ``favored treatment to friends'' and``tarnished his high office.''   Thornburgh, he said, ``will be an attorney general of adifferent and better mold. ... He will do as much as he can torepair the damage and injustices of the Meese regime.''   Kennedy said he admired Thornburgh's work as director of theInstitute of Politics at the John F. Kennedy School of Governmentat Harvard University. The institute is named after the senator'sbrother.   ``Clearly, we have a superior nominee here,'' Sen. Paul Simon,D-Ill., said of Thornburgh.   The attacks on Meese were lacking when Republicans spoke, butthe praise for Thornburgh was bipartisan.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. said Thornburgh has demonstrated thecharacteristics needed for the job: ``character, integrity, goodjudgment, competence and independence.''   Thornburgh ran the Justice Department's criminal division duringthe Ford administration, and established the public integritysection that prosecutes corrupt public officials.</TEXT><HEAD>mh</HEAD></DOC>
