Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> T </CO><IN> TEL </IN><G> JUS FCC </G><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Seeking to dissociate itself from the phone-porn business, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. is going to stop dial-it services from making money on ATandamp;T lines.    Separately, a federal appeals court in New York dealt the dial-a-porn business another setback, affirming long-contested regulations that make it harder to dial raunchy phone tapes.    The two developments are the latest shots in a bitter battle over dial-a-porn, which is becoming widespread both on ATandamp;T and local phone-company lines. While some phone companies have fought for palatable ways to preserve the lucrative services, the federal government has tried to regulate the messages, and civil libertarians have argued that parents, not governments, should police phone lines.    Customers usually pay about 50 cents a minute for dial-it services; ATandamp;T currently passes along as much as five cents a call to the outside suppliers of such taped messages. Not all dial-it services offer sexual material. Other companies offer such things as sports scores, state lottery results and financial information. One stock-market tape is sponsored by Dow Jones andamp; Co., publisher of this newspaper.    Now ATandamp;T says it plans to stop giving dial-it services any money at all. The phone company took pains to suggest that the change wasn't simply a step to crack down on phone porn, and indeed that ATandamp;T had never been actively subsidizing alleged pornographers.    It called the payments to dial-it suppliers &quot;promotional compensation&quot; that was originally offered to attract new tape suppliers by helping them defray costs. It said that lure is no longer needed now that the seven-year-old dial-it service is &quot;well established.&quot;    &quot;Our business decision to remove promotional compensation also means that ATandamp;T will no longer be providing unintended economic support for messages that some of our customers believe are pornographic,&quot; ATandamp;T Vice Chairman Charles Marshall said in a statement. Those messages include, to name just one example, &quot;Fantasy Phone,&quot; in which a panting female voice graphically describes various sex acts.    While dial-it services of all types won't be able to make money from ATandamp;T any more, some may choose to keep their tapes running to promote a company or public service. In some cases, they can also still make money with local phone companies.    The court decision concerned a lawsuit by Carlin Communications Inc., a provider of what it calls &quot;adult messages.&quot; Carlin, a closely held company based in New York, has for several years been challenging Federal Communications Commission regulations of dial-a-porn services.    In its opinion, a federal appeals court affirmed a rule the FCC published last year. It said providers of obscene messages needed to screen callers by requiring credit-card payment or an access code, or by scrambling the tapes so that only callers with unscrambling devices could hear them.    The FCC said it may appeal part of the decision, which said the rules couldn't apply to &quot;indecent&quot; messages -- only to &quot;obscene&quot; messages. A Carlin attorney called the decision disappointing but said it wouldn't apply to Carlin's tapes, which the company doesn't define as &quot;obscene.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
