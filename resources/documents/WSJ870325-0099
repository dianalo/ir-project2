A large man in a red shirt rushes to the podium and presents him with a mammoth submarine sandwich he calls a &quot;Haig Hero.&quot; And when an aide hands him a pair of scissors to cut the ribbon on his campaign headquarters, sandwiched between a floral shop and a lunch bar, the candidate says that he's used to a bayonet.    Then, in a half hour's time Alexander Haig is off by helicopter to a remote village in the White Mountains that is home to 33 registered voters. The former secretary of state and supreme allied commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, formally declaring his presidential candidacy, has embarked on perhaps his final campaign, one designed to put him in control.    The man who announced he was &quot;in control here in the White House&quot; moments after President Reagan was wounded by a gunman in Washington six years ago began his own drive for the White House yesterday. He urged voters in New Hampshire, site of the first presidential primary of 1988, to see that &quot;inside this exterior, militant, turf-conscious, excessively ambitious demeanor is a heart as big as all outdoors.&quot;    In an afternoon speech here and in earlier remarks at New York's Waldorf Astoria, Mr. Haig pledged to continue what he called &quot;this renaissance of the American spirit&quot; that was fashioned by President Reagan. The Republican candidate outlined a political platform that stresses job retraining, plant modernization and streamlining of the judicial system.    But this West Point soldier, who guided one president from office and lost the battle to guide another president's foreign policy, is clearly putting the emphasis of his own presidential campaign on experience.    Mr. Haig, 62 years old, is hoping to follow the path that George Washington, Andrew Jackson, William Henry Harrison, Ulysses Grant and Dwight Eisenhower took from general's stars to civilian commander-in-chief. It was a destination also reached by his secretary-of-state predecessors James Monroe, James Madison and John Quincy Adams.    He is a veteran of the Korean and Vietnam wars as well as of battles as the White House chief of staff in the final days of the Nixon administration and as secretary of state in the first Reagan term. In that role he often sparred with Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger and with Jeane Kirkpatrick, then the chief U.S. delegate to the United Nations. In Mr. Haig's resignation letter, he warned President Reagan that U.S. foreign policy was &quot;shifting from that careful course that we laid out together.&quot;    Standing before a few dozen supporters in the indoor shopping center here yesterday, Mr. Haig, in a reference to Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, said voters &quot;will have to consider who will be sitting across the table from the most adept, capable and, perhaps for that reason, the most dangerous leader of the Soviet Union since the days of Lenin.&quot;    Even so, Mr. Haig's campaign strategists say they want to soften the image of the former general, whose name, according to a Gallup Poll, is recognizable to four-fifths of the electorate. &quot;We don't have to buy name identification,&quot; says Pat Roberts, the Haig campaign manager.    &quot;What we have to do is show the country a man different from the public servant everyone's seen on television, a human, down-to-earth side of him.&quot;    The latest Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll places Mr. Haig last in a field of eight Republican candidates, with only 1% of the likely GOP vote. But the candidate asserted: &quot;I have a very substantial constituency, and that's the American people.&quot;    In his first official campaign trip, which also took him to the hamlet of Dixville Notch, N.H., and then on to Iowa, the ordinarily flamboyant Mr. Haig was dressed in a muted gray suit but offered samples of the tortuous rhetoric that has become a Haig trademark:    &quot;There's no question that the sophistication of statecraft in the modern world, the globalization of America, the emerging intimacy of our relations with like-minded nations in political, economic and security affairs, demands a high level of experience in all of these fields.&quot;    Mr. Haig, a former president and chief operating officer of United Technologies Corp., said he wouldn't rule out increased taxes as a means of reducing the federal budget deficit but wouldn't prescribe it as the &quot;introductory remedy.&quot; He called for relaxing antitrust laws to bolster U.S. competitiveness and favors deployment of the Strategic Defense Initiative; but he also argues that a comprehensive space-based defense umbrella is still 15 years away. </TEXT></DOC>
