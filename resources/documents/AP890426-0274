Bilzerian looks more like an early-'70s campusradical than a corporate raider who plopped down $1.06 billion tomuscle a takeover of Singer Co.   He surprised Wall Street with hardball tactics that helped himmake more than $50 million in four failed takeovers before astunning victory in a battle for the former sewing machine companyturned electronics defense contractor.   Bilzerian now is breaking ground in another way: His trial onsecurities fraud charges set to start Monday will be the firstcourtroom test of government efforts to prosecute so-called stock``parking'' schemes.   Bilzerian, 38, a Harvard Business School graduate and Vietnamveteran, is charged with 11 counts of securities and tax fraud,conspiracy and making false disclosures in what the governmentdescribes as a two-year lawbreaking spree.   His trial at Manhattan federal court _ the OK Corral for defenselawyers and prosecutors in the more than three-year crackdown onWall Street crime _ also will test anew the credibility of a keygovernment informant, stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies.   Jefferies has given the government information for severalindictments in exchange for leniency in his sentencing on twofelonies. He was the main witness in the GAF Corp. stockmanipulation case _ which has twice ended in a mistrial, a majorsetback for the government.   `If they go after a second major case and lose it they've got areal problem,'' said Harvey J. Goldschmid, a securities lawprofessor at Columbia University Law School.   Bilzerian is accused of conspiring with Jefferies, who ran a LosAngeles brokerage bearing his name, to violate securities laws inthe attempted takeovers of Cluett, Peabody andamp; Co., Hammermill PaperCo., and H.H. Robertson Co., and a stock sale in Armco Inc., in1985 and 1986.   The deals all included stock arrangements that have been chasedby the Securities and Exchange Commission for years but gainedprominence during the scandals that engulfed the business world inthe mid-1980s.   Stock parking refers to the sale or transfer of securities toconceal true ownership and avoid federal disclosure or tax laws.Under a typical parking arrangement, someone buys stock with thesecret understanding that the real owner will repurchase it at aset later date.   While parking itself is not defined anywhere as a crime, any``willful'' violation of the 1934 Securities and Exchange Act canbe prosecuted criminally.   ``I might give (stock) to you if I was going to Antarctica fortwo years and I wanted it safely kept,'' said Sam Scott Miller, aNew York securities lawyer. ``There's no crime if we're not tryingto evade disclosure or tax requirements.''   The parking charges in the Bilzerian case allege the Tampa,Fla., investor sought to conceal his level of ownership to maskpossible takeover bids. SEC laws require public disclosure when 5percent of a company is acquired.   Other cases _ including plea deals made by Jefferies andimprisoned inside trader Ivan Boesky _ have charged violators withtemporarily swapping stock for cash to allow them to take positionslarger than their capital base would permit.   But defense lawyers maintain the government is attempting tocriminalize highly technical securities regulations, a tactic oneattorney equated with ``trying to shoot a butterly with a cannon.''   They say such violations should be dealt with by the SEC, whichhas the power to levy huge fines and ban broker-dealers from thesecurities business for life.   ``It's against the law but people had never thought of that assomething that should be prosecuted as a crime as opposed tosomething that should be dealt with by regulators,'' said GandolfoV. DiBlasi, a New York securities litigator.   Added Arthur F. Mathews, Bilzerian's lawyer: ``The government istrying to stretch and make criminal something that has never beenprosecuted before criminally.''   Parking activities have been included in the SEC's case againstDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc., the Manhattan U.S. attorney's officeindictment of Drexel financier Michael Milken as well as the Boeskyand Jefferies cases.   It will have a high courtroom profile in the Bilzerian case, andthe racketeering and fraud cases against defunct Princeton-NewportPartners LP and Milken, which charge overlapping parking schemes.   ``The line between civil and criminal law is wavy in thisarea,'' said Columbia's Goldschmid.   ``Fundamentally if something nasty is being done in terms of theparking it seems legitimate to criminalize the area,'' he said.``The problem is that too extensive a use of the criminal law maytrivialize enforcement.''   Bilzerian's January 1988 takeover of Stamford, Conn.-basedSinger is not mentioned in the indictment. He has denied allcharges and faces a maximum five years in jail and $250,000 fine oneach count.   Since becoming chairman of Singer, Blizerian has graduallydismantled the defense contractor, selling off its 12 operatingunits and making an estimated $100 million above his acquisitioncosts.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for Sunday, April 30</NOTE></DOC>
