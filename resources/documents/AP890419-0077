An estimated 15,000 students, workers, peasants, and othersrallied late today in central Beijing's Tiananmen square withbanners eulogizing reformist leader Hu Yaobang and carrying sloganssuch as ``Long live democracy and freedom!'' It was the third dayof such protests.   One student speaker shouted, ``let Cixi retire,'' a reference toChina's 19th century Empress Dowager who continued to exerciseautocratic rule even though in name she had retired. Students saidhe was really calling for the ouster of 84-year-old senior leaderDeng Xiaoping.   ``The old views and system can't satisfy the people anymore,''one student yelled from a ledge on a monument to revolutionaryheroes in the center of the vast square.   In Shanghai, more than 1,000 students marched for the third timein four days and campus walls were plastered with posters demandingfreedom of speech and of the press, witnesses said.   The demonstrators who tried repeatedly to enter partyheadquarters _ engaging plainclothes police in shoving matches _dispersed before dawn today after about 500 police linked arms andmarched toward them.   The show of force by police appeared aimed at endinground-the-clock demonstrations since Monday by thousands ofstudents in front of Zhongnanhai, the party headquarters, and thenearby Great Hall of the People, the seat of government.   The demonstrations are the largest in Beijing sincerevolutionary leader Mao Tse-tung greeted huge rallies of radicalleftist students in the late 1960s in adjacent Tiananmen Square,where about 10,000 people gathered Tuesday.   There have been no reports of arrests.   However, three student representatives who were allowed to enterZhongnanhai early in the nighttime protest did not come out,students said. The compound houses party offices and officialresidences for China's leaders.   Students sitting outside the compound's ornate red-lacqueredgate chanted, ``Come out, Li Peng!,'' a reference to China'spremier. They also chanted slogans heard throughout the protests:``Down with corruption, overthrow bureaucracy, long live thepeople!''   The official Xinhua News Agency later said some people in thecrowd threw bottles and shoes at Zhongnanhai guards and that onewas bruised in the cheek by a flying bottle.   One student leader, Wang Dan of Beijing University, said thestudents planned further actions every day through Saturday, whenthe government will hold a funeral in the Great Hall for oustedparty chief Hu, a reformer who died Saturday of a heart attack.   Protesters in Tiananmen Square had draped the monument torevolutionary heroes with wreathes and banners eulogizing Hu fromabout 20 Beijing universities and two newspapers.   The demonstrators demand a party reassessment of Hu, who wasforced to resign in 1987 for failing to be tough on pro-democracystudent demonstrators in 1986-87. Those were the last majordemonstrations in China and triggered a political backlash againstliberalism.   The students also demand that top leaders publish statements oftheir personal wealth and incomes, abolish a Beijing ban on marcheswithout police permission, increase money for education, allow afree press and repudiate past anti-liberal political campaigns.   In Shanghai, more than 1,000 students from Fudan Universitymarched toward People's Square, said Jason Hurtado of Portland,Ore., an American teacher at the university.   An Italian student at the school confirmed reports of a marchand said school loudspeakers were urging students not to go intothe streets, saying their actions were illegal.</TEXT></DOC>
