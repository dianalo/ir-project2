 The big fast one will sit on my desk, and thesmall portable one will be in my briefcase or (someday) backpack.andM;The portabale computer I have been carrying around lately is the ToshibaT1000, and this column will begin with a look at it.andP;  The T1000 is notdesigned to substitute for a full-function desktop machine, but is anexcellent, low-cost portable.andM;One of the places I carried my T1000 to recently was IBM's Academic ComputingConference, which focused on educational applications of IBM personalcomputers, which I will talk about.andM;We will also look at the Sun and Toshiba's plans to market SPARC-basedcomputers in the personal computer price range.andP;  If they succeed, we willhave a mass-market alternative to the Macintosh and PCs.andM;The Toshiba T1000andM;Portable computers fall into two general categories, full-function andancillary.andP;  Full function portables are designed to equal or surpass thepower of a desktop computer while ancillary portables are meant to complementa desktop computer.andM;The Toshiba T1000 is an ancillary portable.andP;  You can take it home for theweekend and transfer your work to a desktop computer when back in the office.andO;The T1000 is a 512K, DOS-based computer weighting only 6-1/2 pounds.andP;  Itsmost important feature is an optional (highly recommended) 768K memory board.andO;The optional memory can be allocated as additional main memory, extendedmemory, and, most important, as battery-backed RAM disk.andP;  (RAM disk issemiconductor memory used as storage by simulating a magnetic disk.andP;  The RAMdisk appears to the user as a small, fast disk drive.)andM;Using RAM instead of a hard disk is a big win in an ancillary portable.andP;  Itis fast, light, reliable, and saves power.andP;  I allocate 128K to main memory(bringing it up to the DOS limit of 640K) and use the remaining 640K for RAMdisk.andP;  Since DOS (version 2.1) is in a separate ROM, the full 640K isavailable for storage.andP;  That is sufficient to hold one or two applicationprograms such as a compiler, word processor, or spreadsheet, as well as yourworking files.andP;  A built-in 720K floppy drive is used for removable storage.andM;The T1000 has only a 4.77 MHz 8088 CPU which would make it intolerably slowby todayhs standards if it were not for the RAM disk.andP;  Table I compares thespeed of the T1000 with an IBM PS/2, Model 50, and an 8 MHz, 80286-basedcomputer.andP;  Pure file I/O speeds are nearly the same for both machines;however, the 8088 slows the T1000 when loading programs or copying files.andO;T1000 video output is quite slow for programs using DOS calls; however, manyprograms write dinectly to the video RAM, and in that case, the speeds aremuch closer.andM;The T1000 suffers most noticeably on internal computing speed.andP;  It has thespeed of an original, 1981 IBM PC.andP;  The PC Magazine internal speed benchmarkrated the PS/2 4.5 times faster than an original PC, and the Norton Indexbenchmark rated it 10.7 times faster.andP;  I could not explain thatinconsistency, so I timed a spreadsheet I had been experimenting with.andP;  Thespreadsheet, which calculates 2,000 values of the series [f(x.sub.i+1)] =[4kx.sub.i.(1 - x.sub.i.),] was 5 time as fast on the PS/2.andP;  When the valueswere computed and graphed, the speed ratio was 3 because the video speedswere closer.andP;  No matter how you slice it, the T1000 is slow internally;however, it is comparable in speed to portables without RAM disk.andM;Display quality is another key question with portables.andP;  The T1000 has a 25by 80 display which is compatible with the original IBM color graphicsadapter.andP;  The display is not backlit, and the contrast is poor.andP;  Wordprocessing is a tough test for a portable display, and the T1000, asdelivered, fails.andP;  It is difficult to find the cursor in a screen filled withtext; however, all is not lost!andM;A simple program to enlarge the cursor from an underline to a rectangle savesthe day.andP;  If you compile the program in Figure 1 and put it in anAUTOEXEC.BAT file, the T1000 screen becomes usable.andM;As with most portables, the keyboard is a little narrower than that of adesktop computer.andP;  The combined width of the letter keys is about 10 percentless than on the PS/2.andP;  The &quot;control&quot; key is to the left of the &quot;A&quot; key, ason the original IBM PC, which might cause some errors.andP;  There are 10 functionkeys across the top of the keyboard, and the cursor control keys are notarranged in the usual diamond pattern.andP;  If you intend to type in a library orduring a lecture, people may give you nastly looks because of the noise.andP;  Itype about as fast on the T1000 as on the PS/2 but make more errors and needmore rest.andP;  Still, the keyboard is satisfactory for a portable.andM;Public relations photos often show smiling executives using portablecomputers on airplanes.andP;  Toshiba claims that a T1000 with a modem andoptional memory card should run for 3.4 hours on a fully charged batterybefore the battery-low indicator turns on.andP;  I followed their charginginstructions (a deep discharge followed by an 8-hour charge) and found theactual time to be three hours and five minutes.andP;  According to the manual, thecomputer will shut off about ten minutes after the battery-low indicatorcomes on; however, the one I tested ran another hour and twenty minutes.andO;That adds up to four hours and twenty-five minutes on a full charge.andP;  This isbetter than many portables, but do not plan a long day at the beach or across-country flight with a T1000.andM;I also tested Traveling Software's Battery Watch, a program that monitorspower consumption.andP;  Battery Watch has a library of tables describing thebattery capacity and power consumption of various configurations of popularportables.andP;  For example, for the T1000, the battery capacity is 1300 mAHours; the average total drain for a system with extended memory and a modemis 328 mA, and the Floppy disk consumes 389 mA; based on these assumptions, afully charged battery should last just under four hours.andP;  The programmonitors system activity--particularly disk utilization--and keeps a runningestimate of remaining battery capacity.andP;  Its four-hour estimate of batterylife was more accurate than the battery-low indicator, but it ties up 12K inmemory and 17K of RAM disk.andM;Battery life is not a problem in a hotel room or when used at home over theweekend, but it is a serious limitation of today's portables.andP;  You cannotspend a day taking notes at a conference or in the stacks at the librarywithout sitting by an AC plug.andP;  Could battery life be extended by circuitrythat automatically places the computer in a quiescent, stand-by state duringpauses in activity?andM;In addition to longer battery life, we need portables that are physicallydesigned to be used away from desktops--in easy chairs or under trees.andP;  I goalong with Alan Kay who began dreaming of and designing portable computers atXerox PARC in the 1960s.andP;  Kay says that a true portable is one his motherwill want to take to the market with her grocery list.andM;If your desktop computer has a 3-1/2&quot; floppy disk drive, you can exchangedisks directly using the T1000's built-in floppy drive.andP;  Otherwise, you willeither need Toshiba's optional, external 5&quot; drive or a program to transferdata between ports on the two machines.andP;  I tried two transfer programs,Laplink from Traveling Software and Brooklyn Bridge from White Crane Systems,and found both satisfactory.andP;  With Brooklyn Bridge though, you must choosebetween parallel and serial cables, while the Laplink cable is dual purpose.andM;All things considered, I like the T1000.andP;  It is not the ideal &quot;electronicpad,&quot; which I someday hope to have.andP;  It should not be your only computer, butit is great in a supporting role.andP;  The &quot;street price&quot; of a T1000 withextended memory is under $900, making it an excellent value.andM;IBM Academic ComputingandM;ConferenceandM;IBM held their annual Academic Computing Conference in Anaheim, California inJune, 1989.andP;  The conference centers on post-secondary courseware for the PCplatform.andP;  There were 1,100 attendees representing 475 institutions rangingfrom Glendale Junior College to Carnegie-Mellon University.andP;  The conferenceschedule alternated between discipline-specific parallel sessions, in whichpapers on courseware were presented, and demonstrations.andM;During the demonstrations, the authors of each paper were available at smallbooths where they ran and discussed their programs.andP;  The demonstration formatresembled poster sessions at a technical conference, and it worked well.andO;Although there were 96 papers and demonstrations, there was plenty of time tosee them all and to meet the authors.andM;The keynote speaker was Stanford University's Patrick Suppes, a well-knownlogician and pioneer in computer assisted instruction.andP;  Suppes spoke oftechnological developments, cognitive research, and organizational change.andO;In technology, he has great hopes for spoken I/O and natural languageprocessing.andP;  Next he called for cognitive research to better understanduniversity students.andP;  He stated that there are approximately 30,000 articleson reading education but barely any research into what students are doing andthinking when learning subjects such as physics and calculus.andP;  Finally, hefeels we need organizational changes.andP;  Suppes &quot;teaches&quot; two courses,Introduction to Logic and Axiomatic Set Theory, without coming to aclassroom.andP;  The courses are taught entirely via computeraided instruction.andO;He correctly points out that most universities would not give a professorcredit for teaching a computer-based course or for the time needed to developit.andM;IBM also used the conference to demonstrate recently announced products andtrumpet their new commitment to multimedia products and applications.andP;  Since'86, IBM has been marketing the Infowindow system, a touchscreen-controlledcomputer and video disk combination.andP;  Infowindow is designed for educationand industrial training, and about 500 courses and 20 authoring tools havebeen quietly developed for the system.andP;  IBM showed Infowindow at theconference and announced two multimedia software packages, the Audio VisualConnection (AVC) and Storyboard Plus, version 2.andM;AVC is an authoring language and development tool that can create a digitizedimage from a camera, disc or tape, and sound from a microphone, CD, or tape.andO;Storyboard is used to develop and deliver on-screen presentations.andP;  They caninclude text; graphs; drawn, scanned, and clip art and a variety of fades andsimple animations.andP;  With add-ins from third parties, a window with live ordigitally stored video is also possible.andP;  To complement these programs, IBMalso announced audio and video capture/playback cards.andM;More important than these announcements is IBM's new commitment tomultimedia.andP;  (Perhaps they were won over by Apple's evangelism formultimedia.)andP;  The Advanced Educational Systems Department that marketedInfowindow has been renamed MultiMedia Solutions.andP;  IBM people are makingsimilar statements to those of James E. Dezell, vp for Eduational Systems,who says, &quot;We are at the beginning of a fundamental shift from a text-basededucation system to one based on multimedia,&quot; and Peter Blakeney, manager ofMultiMedia Marketing Support, promises a commitment to future productsincluding CD-ROM XA and on-screen stylus input.andM;Even with the multimedia announcements and prototypes, the conference feltrather sedate in comparison to what one sees in the Macintosh world.andP;  Part ofthat is the graphic emphasis on the Mac, though a number of windowsapplications were presented, and part is just the IBM culture.andM;Each conference attendee received a 370 page loose-leaf notebook with twopage descriptions of courseware available for PCs and compatibles.andO;Attendance was by invitation, and there was no registration fee.andP;  If you areinterested in attending next year, contact Frederick Dwyer of IBM.andM;SPARC Shoots for the PCandM;MainstreamandM;Many personal computer programs and hardware developments were adapted fromworkstations.andP;  The Macintosh and Windows user interfaces, and drwing,painting, word processing, and page layout programs all derive fromworkstation software.andP;  Some products, e.g., Interleaf's publishing program,are workstation ports.andP;  No longer satisfied with leading the personalcomputing market, workstation companies are trying to enter it.andP;  For exampe,Sun's SPARCstation 1 has a base price of $8995 (without disk) placing it inthe ballpark of a high-end Macintosh.andP;  With a 3-slot bus and low chip count(using 7 custom ICs), the design is more like a Macintosh than other low-endworkstations.andP;  The SPARCstation 1 is designed for high-volume, automatedmanufacturing.andM;Are you wondering why they call it a &quot;SPARCstation?&quot;andP;  It uses the ScalableProcessor Architecture CPU that Sun designed and is licensing to others.andP;  Sunwould like to see SPARC join the Intel and Motorola lines as CPUs formass-market personal computers.andP;  They have licensed several companies tomanufacture SPARC CPUs and support chips and SPARC-based computers, but thelargest company to sign up is Toshiba.andM;Toshiba has licensed the right to manufacture SPARC chips and already makesmany system components.andP;  Most significantly, they are the world's largestsupplier of dynamic RAM chips.andP;  Their sales of 21 million 1-Mbit chips duringthe first quarter of 1989 accounted for 28 percent of the world market.andO;Mitsubishi was second with 9.5 million, and NEC, Hitachi, and Fujitsu wereeach over 8 million.andP;  Toshiba has also announced plans to push aggressivelyinto 4-Mbit chips.andP;  They expect to be producing 1 million 4-Mb dynamic RAMSper month by March, 1990.andP;  Though many market forecasters disagree, BobBrown, senior vice president of semiconductor operations at Toshiba AmericaElectronic Components, predicts that the cost parity point between 1-Mbit and4-Mbit chips will be reached in mid 1990.andP;  That does not mean the price of4-Mbit chips will fall to under 4 times that of 1-Mbit chips.andP;  Parity isachieved at a chip cost ratio of between 5 and 6 to 1.andP;  At that point, totalsystem cost, including power requirements and board space, is equal.andM;Toshiba's SPARC announcement promised they would focus on low-cost,high-volume markets and make systems available early in 1990.andP;  That soundslike a great way to sell those 4-Mbit RAMs.andP;  The only problem with all thisis software.andP;  Not many people will buy SPARCstations to run 123 or Wordstarin DOS emulation mode or even to run 123 under Unix.andP;  Workstation softwaredeveloped at universities is often unsupported and difficult to use.andP;  (In Themythical Man-Month, Frederick Brooks estimated that there is a 9-time costdifference between a debugged program which can be used by its author on themachine on which it was developed and a finished programing systems product.)andO;Commercial workstation software is expensive by personal computing standards,and it is not found in retail distribution channels.andM;Quantitative improvements on current personal computer software are notenough.andP;  Sun needs killer applications.andP;  Perhaps they can achieve a softwareadvantage with unique group-support software that exploits their networkingenvironment.andP;  Another possibility is text processing software with someunderstanding of content, perhaps doing automatic document classifying.andP;  Ifit is not a killer application, it could be a breakthrough in systemssoftware--transparent data exchange between applications on a workstation oracross networks or a powerful, graphically-oriented development and scriptingtool designed for end users, as opposed to system programmers.andP;  Sun isworking hard to convince software companies to develop products for theirsystems, and if they do not succeed, neither will SPARC-based personalcomputers.andP;  As a consumer, I hope they do.andM;For a full description of Sun's SPARCstation 1, see the June and July issuesof the Microprocessor Report.andP;  In fact, anyone with an interest insemiconductor business or technology should take a look at this newsletter.andO;POINTERS: Toshiba America Inc., 9740 Irvine Boulevard, Irvine, CA 92718,(800) 457-7777 Traveling Software, 18702 North Creek Parkway, Bothell, WA98011, (800) 343-8080 White Crane Systems, 6400 Atlantic Boulevard, Suite180, Norcross, CA 30071, (404) 446-0660 IBM MultiMedia Products, IBM BranchOffices or (800) IBM-2468 Frederick Dwyer, IBM Corporation AcademicInformation Systems, 472 Wheelers Farms Road, Milford, CT 06460 TheMicroprocessor Report, 550 California Avenue, Suite 320, Palo Alto, CA 94306,(415) 494-2677.andP;
