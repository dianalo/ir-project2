Speaking to a special session of the ruling Burma SocialistProgram Party, the 77-year-old leader cited bloody anti-governmentrioting in March and June as a main reason for his resignation.   Five veteran party leaders, including the nation's president andvice president _ less important positions than the partychairmanship _ also resigned.   ``Since I am indirectly responsible for the March and Juneaffairs and because of my adanced age, I am resigning from bothparty chairmanship and also as a member,'' Ne Win told 1,000delegates in remarks broadcast on state radio and television.   ``Bloodshed in March and June showed the lack of trust andconfidence in the government,'' Ne Win said. ``To find out whetherthe majority or the minority are behind (the demonstrators), areferendum must be held so the people can choose between theexisting one-party system or a multi-party system.''   He said the referendum would be held no later than the end ofSeptember, until which the current government would continue itsfunctions.   If a multi-party system is chosen, Ne Win said, generalelections must be held. Even if voters chose to retain a one-partystate, there should be ``necessary modifications,'' he said.   ``Whatever the results of the referendum, and whatever the newgovernment, I will completely retire from politics,'' Ne Win said.   The party congress was expected to choose a new chairman Monday.Maung Maung Kha, prime minister since 1977, was seen as a likelycandidate.   Since coming to power in a 1962 military coup, Ne Win led Burmainto isolation from the world community. The nation's economydeteriorated, and political and personal freedoms were curtailed.   Student-led demonstrations have rocked Rangoon and other Burmesecities thre times since last October, resulting in deaths, massarrests and the closure of universities.   Ne Win resigned from the presidency in 1981 but retained the farmore important party post. He was the most powerful figure in Burma.   Authorities announced the convening of the three-day partycongress on July 7, two weeks after thousands of students and otherdemonstrators battled riot police in the streets of the capital,leaving at least nine people dead.   A daytime curfew imposed on Rangoon following the rioting waslifted, but violence spread to the cities of Prome and Taunggyilast week and at least four people were reported killed.   State radio disclosed last week that 41 people who were packedinto police vans during rioting in March suffocated on their way toprison.   Despite promises of economic liberalization, the government inOctober withdrew three currency notes from circulation and offeredno compensation, triggering the first of the three majoranti-government protests.   Western diplomats in Rangoon and other Western observers saidthe outbursts after years of passivity reflected intensedisillusionment with the government.   Regarded as potentially the richest nation in resources inSoutheast Asia, Burma has a per capita income of less than $200 andranks among the world's 10 poorest countries.   Once the world's largest rice exporter and an oil producer,Burma has suffered food shortages and has had to import petroleumproducts.   Although the state officially controls much of the economy, mostBurmese rely on black market goods smuggled in from Thailand, Chinaand Malaysia.   Most foreign analysts and many Burmese blame Ne Win's rigid,so-called ``Burmese Way to Socialism'' for these failures. The``Way'' is an amalgam, forged during Ne Win's early years in power,of a centralized economy, one-party military-backed rule, andBuddhism.   Probably as a result of Burma's colonial past, Ne Win alsosought to exclude foreign influence, including direct involvementby private foreign companies. In recent years, tourists have beenallowed to enter the country, but only on seven-day visas.   The five leaders who resigned wth Ne Win were San Yu, party vicechairman and president of the country; Aye Ko, partysecretary-general and vice president; Sein Lwin, party jointgeneral secretary and secretary of the Council of State; Kyaw Htin,party central executive committee mamber, deputy prime minister anddefense minister, and Tun Tin, central executive committee members,deputy prime minister and finance minister.   They are to retain their government positions until a newgovernment is formed.</TEXT></DOC>
