Yes, but just a few. Energy stocks and many utility sharesare still attractively priced, bargain-hunting money managerssay. Otherwise, inexpensive stocks are hard to find.</LP><TEXT>   That's not too surprising. The Greenspan rally is onemonth old. The Gulf War bull market is 15 months old. Andmost stock indexes hit record highs last week.   But elevated stock prices don't discourage the bargainhunters from scouring the market for companies with decentgrowth prospects at prices that are reasonable compared withper-share earnings, dividends or other yardsticks.   Here's a look at the stocks some managers are callingbargains now:   Energy producers. &quot;Energy and utilities&quot; are the ticket,says W. Anthony Hitschler, president and chief investmentofficer at Brandywine Asset Management in Wilmington, Del.The firm owns some Amerada Hess, Texaco, Royal Dutch/Shell,Exxon, Phillips Petroleum and Atlantic Richfield. &quot;Just takeArco,&quot; Mr. Hitschler says. &quot;It has dramaticallyunderperformed the market over the past 12 months;&quot; pays a 5%dividend, compared with less than 3% for the market; andsells for 13 times reported earnings, well below the market's23 times.   Lois Burleigh, director of equity investments at ASBCapital Management in Washington, has been buying Amoco andArco, and lately has been accumulating British Petroleum.   Oilfield services. Ms. Burleigh also likes oil-servicestocks, such as Halliburton, Baker Hughes, Dresser, Rowan andHelmerich andamp; Payne. Mr. Hitschler favors &quot;some of the naturalgas distributors and pipelines&quot; but declines to name thembecause he's still buying shares.   What has been keeping the oils and oil-service stocksdown? Some investors fear that Kuwait and Iraq will resumeoil production in quantity while Saudi Arabia won't cutoutput much. Could be, says Mr. Hitschler, but oil stockshave lagged so badly that &quot;we feel there's more opportunitythan risk.&quot;   Ms. Burleigh goes a step further: &quot;I think you will seeSaudi Arabia cut back production,&quot; she says. &quot;Saudi Arabiadoesn't want the price {now around $18 a barrel} to go toohigh, but they also don't want to see it go through thefloor.&quot;   Utilities. Mr. Hitschler's favorite is the telephonecompany Bell Atlantic. The stock &quot;really has done nothing forthe last 12 months,&quot; he says, and it boasts a 5.3% yield.Acquisitions in the cellular area have hampered earnings nearterm, but will boost them long term, he argues.   Ms. Burleigh favors Bell Atlantic, Nynex and PacificTelesis. These stocks &quot;have underperformed because ofconcerns about competition, which I think are overblown,&quot; shesays. &quot;They're a value at these levels, and will probablyoutperform this year.&quot;   Geraldine Weiss, author of the book &quot;Dividends Don't Lie&quot;and editor of Investment Quality Trends in La Jolla, Calif.,has a short list of undervalued stocks that's peppered withutilities. Among them are Allegheny Power System, AmericanElectric Power, Cincinnati Gas andamp; Electric, CommonwealthEdison, Public Service of Colorado, Public Service EnterpriseGroup and Texas Utilities.   Growth cyclicals. New York money manager Alan Bond,president of Bond, Procope Capital Management, says he'sconsidering some stocks that rise and fall with the economybut tend to achieve rising earnings over the long haul. Theseinclude Bandag, Cooper Tire andamp; Rubber, Illinois Tool Works andWausau Paper Mills. He hasn't bought any of them yet,however, and fears it may be too late to buy Bandag, whichhas surged.   Grab bag. Tom Jackson, who manages $1.9 billion atPrudential Securities Equity Management Associates in Newark,N.J., seeks out stocks that are cheap compared with bookvalue (corporate assets minus liabilities per share). &quot;I loveDigital Equipment,&quot; he says. Among his other big holdings areITT, Kmart, property/casualty insurer Safeco, UnitedTelecommunications and International Business Machines.   Charles Will, a portfolio manager in Louisville, Ky., sayshe's drawn towards American Express, New York Times and DowJones, which publishes this newspaper. But he won't buy anyof the three now because he expects the overall market totumble, pulling down all stocks, whether they are cheap ordear.   One manager with an outstanding track record, who declinedto be named, is keeping close tabs on the big drug stocks.They're far from bargains yet, he says, but they have beenunder heavy selling pressure for a week and may enter bargainterritory if the trend continues.   Some stocks on Ms. Weiss's undervalued list are drugdistributor Bergen Brunswig, pen maker A.T. Cross, autopartscompany Echlin, check printer John H. Harland, hospitaloperator Humana, IBM, Imperial Chemical Industries ofBritain, the paper-products company James River, Luby'sCafeterias, ServiceMaster, United Industrial and Zero.   The accompanying table illustrates a more mechanicalapproach to bargain-hunting. Using the Institutional BrokerEstimate System database and Data Window software, a universeof 1,500 large stocks was screened. The program identifiedmore than 400 stocks in which analysts expect at least a 15%earnings gain in the current fiscal year and a similar gainnext year. The list was then narrowed to stocks selling atless than 15 times actual per-share earnings for the pastfiscal year, and less than 15 times estimated earnings forthe current fiscal year. This pared the roster to the 11issues in the table.   Some of these stocks have had stagnant or erratic earningsin the past. Others have debt-laden balance sheets. Moneymanagers emphasize that computerized &quot;screens&quot; should be astarting point for analysis, not a substitute for it.   In this market, &quot;the pickings really are slim,&quot; cautionsMs. Weiss. In her latest tabulation of 350 blue chip stocks,she categorized only 8% as undervalued. &quot;That is the smallestfigure we've seen in the 23 years we've been publishing,&quot; shesays. &quot;It is smaller than in 1966, 1973 or 1987&quot; -- threeyears famous for market tops.   The smallest percentage of bargains she had previouslyfound was 10%, back in 1966. The percentage before the crashin 1987 was 12%. Ms. Weiss's judgments are based mainly on astock's dividend yield compared with its own dividend-yieldhistory. As for the stock market as a whole, Ms. Weiss saysit's generally a screaming bargain when the dividend yield onthe Dow Jones Industrial Average hits 6%, and grosslyovervalued when the yield drops to 3%. Currently, the DowIndustrials' dividend yield is only 2.87%.   ---   What's Still Cheap?                                                                                                          Despite the market's run, these stocks sell for less than15 times per-share earnings. Yet Wall Street analysts expecttheir earnings to grow 15% or better. Of 1500 largest stocksin the I/B/E/S data base*, fewer than 1% met those criteria,described further in the story.
