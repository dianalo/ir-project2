Prices plunged as much as 70 cents a barrel yesterday inthe wake of the Tuesday night meeting of the oil ministers ofSaudi Arabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates.</LP><TEXT>   These members of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries are held by many to be chiefly responsible for theexcess volumes of oil flowing into world markets at themoment. As a result, oil-market participants had beenwatching closely for any solid evidence that either plannedproduction cuts.   But a Tuesday night statement released by the trio inJeddah, Saudi Arabia, after oil markets had closed packedlittle punch. It blamed overproduction for depressing oilmarkets and called on OPEC members to abide by theirproduction quotas.   The joint statement also appealed to non-OPEC producersnot to take advantage of seasonal demand increases to step upoutput. And it said the three ministers would continue tocooperate with their OPEC colleagues in efforts to restoremarket stability.   Meantime, a new survey of OPEC's production releasedyesterday by the Dow Jones International Petroleum Reportshowed total output for last month averaged 23.8 millionbarrels a day. That was 1.7 million above the group'sself-imposed production ceiling. Some OPEC members failed toproduce as much as their quotas, but the average from SaudiArabia, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates totaled 1.9million barrels a day.   Some oil analysts had suggested that the meeting of thePersian Gulf oil ministers was intended to pre-empt apossible emergency conference of all 13 oil ministers thathas been urged in recent days by others in OPEC as oil pricesplummeted. Whether that was the case or not, the analystssaid lack of concrete action by either of the three PersianGulf producers to slow the outpouring of oil from OPECfurther weakens the market.   &quot;The Big Three came up with only a Band-Aid, and it wastoo small and too late,&quot; said Nauman Barakat, first vicepresident of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc.   Yesterday's sell-off was evident in the Tokyo market andthen gained momentum as other markets opened. In Europeanspot markets, North Sea crudes fell at the start, ending theday a sharp 45 cents to 70 cents a barrel lower. Then, WestTexas Intermediate crude for May delivery lost more than 50cents a barrel in the first 15 minutes of trading on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange.   The May WTI contract, which has its last trading daytomorrow, recovered some of the earlier losses but stillended the day down 48 cents a barrel and below thepsychologically important level of $17. It settled at $16.96-- the lowest close for a near-month contract since Dec. 29,1988.   The June WTI contract was down 30 cents to $18.09 abarrel. Outer month futures closed down 21 cents to 34 centsa barrel.   Then, as a climax to yesterday's pricing melee, severalU.S. refiners lowered the prices they will pay in the fieldfor WTI by 75 cents to $15.75 a barrel.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COFFEE: Futures prices fell on the expectation that Brazilwill soon begin actively shipping coffee. The July contractended near the low of the day, with a loss of 2.97 cents apound at 94.89 cents. Brazil today or tomorrow is expected toopen the registration of coffee to be exported for the nextyear, said Sandra Kaul, analyst for Shearson Lehman Hutton,New York. Shipments are expected to begin immediately, shesaid. The expected development caused selling in futuresbecause Brazil is believed to still have some seven millionbags of coffee from the 1989-90 crop and is expected to beginharvesting the 1990-91 crop next month, she said. Theexpected coffee exports &quot;will be coming when the industry isentering the slower-consuming summertime period, when demandfor green coffee seasonally is substantially reduced,&quot; shesaid.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices closed higher despite lateprofit-taking that trimmed advances. The July contractsettled with a gain of 0.34 cent a pound to 15.56 cents aftertrading as high as 15.69 cents. Some traders thought that rawsugar supplies will be tightening in the near future becauseof lower output from Cuba and Thailand, according to oneanalyst. Also, the analyst noted, it won't be until June whenSouthern Hemisphere nations, such as Brazil, Australia, SouthAfrica and Mauritius, will begin to harvest their crops. Inaddition, the market was supported by the purchase of about20,000 tons of refined sugar by Syria for May shipment andreports that Iran had bought 10,000 to 30,000 tons of refinedsugar, analysts said. According to one sugar dealer, theSoviet Union is expected to come into the market at some timedespite concluding an agreement with Cuba that will involvethe exchange of Cuban sugar for Soviet goods. China is also apotential buyer in the world market because Cuban exports tothat country this year have fallen short of expectations, hesaid.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Prices of most cattle futurescontracts settled slightly higher as traders began to take tothe sidelines in anticipation of a government survey offeedlots, which is slated for release tomorrow. CharlesLevitt, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton, Chicago, saidhe expects the report to show that a large number of cattlewill be ready for slaughter in May and June. These cattlewere placed into feedlots at an unusually young age late lastyear when dry weather damaged much of the grazing lands inthe Southern Plains. Feedlots fatten cattle for slaughter.According to Mr. Levitt, the report might show that 6.2million cattle might be sold by the feedlots in the secondquarter to slaughterhouses -- a record level of sales for anysecond quarter. The movement of young cattle to feedlots hasslowed considerably in recent months as pasture conditionshave improved. Mr. Levitt said he expects the government toreport that placements of young cattle onto feedlots dropped10% in March from the year-earlier month. Nonetheless, thegovernment is expected to report that it counted about 10million cattle on feedlots in its 13-state quarterly surveyon April 1, up 1% from the year-earlier date. Prices of hogfutures contracts settled mixed.</TEXT></DOC>
