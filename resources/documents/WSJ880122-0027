The settlement removes covenants that had blocked the company from exploiting 1.9 million acres of land and 2.4 million acres of mineral rights in four northwestern states.    Northern Pacific Railroad Co., a forerunner of Burlington Northern, issued in 1897 two series of bonds with payment schedules of 100 years and 150 years, respectively. As an inducement to leery investors, the railroad promised that any proceeds from its huge land holdings, then largely wilderness, must be applied to railroad operations.    Those lands have become worth much more than the transportation and energy concern needs for the railroad, and the company had been trying to free itself from the liens. Last spring, Burlington agreed to pay remaining bondholders a total of $35.5 million, in return for permission to remove the covenants. A judge approved the agreement in November and it became final Jan. 12.    Holders of the 100-year bonds, due in 1997, will be paid $14.75 for each $100 face value of their holdings, plus interest accrued in an escrow account established last spring. Holders of the 150-year bonds, due in 2047, will receive $45.625 for each $100 face value, plus interest. </TEXT></DOC>
