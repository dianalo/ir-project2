Ledeen, a former consultant to the NationalSecurity Council, writes in ``Perilous Statecraft: An Insider'sAccount of the Iran-Contra Affair.''   ``Bush was a loyal vice president, supporting (President)Reagan's policy,'' Ledeen writes.   But the book says that the Iranians had a different view of Bushand even had a code-name for the vice president: ``Battri.'' Thatderived from the best-selling automobile battery in Iran, calledthe Busch.   Ledeen writes that the Iranians thought Bush was the ``mostpowerful man in the world, hence the man pulling the strings on theIran initiative.''   The Iranians' view stemmed from the fact that Bush had onceheaded the CIA, which the Tehran regime considered the root ofultimate power in the United States.   Bush's resignation from the CIA in the mid-1970s was simply acover story, the Iranians thought.   Ledeen knew about the beginnings of the Iran-Contra affairbecause he was involved in the earliest efforts to learn more aboutthe Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's regime.   U.S. intelligence agencies had huge gaps in their knowledgeabout the fundamentalist Khomeini regime, so in May 1985 Ledeensuggested approaching the Israelis, who were known to have contactsin Iran. Former NSC adviser Robert McFarlane agreed with that move.   The meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peresultimately led to the U.S. decision to ship weapons to Iran throughIsrael. The Americans hoped the sale would lead to the release ofU.S. hostages held by pro-Iranian Shiites in Lebanon.   By November 1986 when the Iran-Contra affair was exposed, onlythree American hostages had been freed while millions of dollars inprofits were secretly diverted to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   Among Ledeen's observations:   _Any deals with the hostages required Khomeini's ``directinvolvement.'' That was because ``th fight between those whofavored hostage release and those who opposed it was so intensethat only the ayatollah could decide.''   _Former CIA director William Casey ordered the CIA to go all outto try to find William Buckley, the CIA station chief in Beirutafter Buckley was captured in March 1984 by pro-Iranian terrorists.Buckley later died in captivity reportedly after being tortured.   ``Casey informed the president of the situation at regularintervals, thereby reinforcing Reagan's strong passions about theLebanon hostages.'' Casey felt responsible for Buckley's fatebecause he had urged the reluctant CIA man to take the job, Ledeensaid.   _Casey never approved of the secret Iran-Contra operationmasterminded by Oliver L. North, a former NSC aide, according toMilton Gould, Casey's long-time friend and lawyer quoted in thebook.   Casey suffered a cerebral seizure in late 1986, shortly afterthe Iran-Contra affair was made public, and died from brain cancerin May 1987.   _McFarlane was in a psychological crisis in the second half of1985, more than a year before he tried to commit suicide by takinga pill overdose.   ``It was clear that McFarlane was no longer functioningeffectively,'' Ledeen writes. The NSC adviser resigned in November1985, but within hours ``he was seized with remorse and wished hehad remained to fight to the end.''   Ledeen denied allegations floated by an Israeli, Amiram Nir,that he may have had a personal financial stake in shipping weaponsto Iran.   Nir, an Israeli official who served as a liaison between hisgovernment and the United States, raised that possibility withNorth.   ``It was all nonsense,'' Ledeen wrote. ``I never received apenny (aside from salary and reimbursement of expenses) as a resultof my work on this project.''</TEXT></DOC>
