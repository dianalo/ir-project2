The Washington-based NASD, which runs the Nasdaq, its automated quotations, over-the-counter stock market, was flooded with phone calls about its new requirement that any firm dealing in low-priced or lightly traded stocks quoted in the Pink Sheets report volume and price data in issues in which its aggregate activity exceeds 50,000 shares or $10,000. The information is being used for Pink Sheets market surveillance.    Elizabeth Wollin, assistant director of automated reports in the NASD's surveillance department, said she fielded more than 100 calls from market makers and others. Besides general questions about the system, some people were confused by news that a related NASD effort -- an &quot;electronic bulletin board&quot; to display Pink Sheets quotes -- has been delayed for at least several weeks. But the reporting requirement that started yesterday wasn't affected by the bulletin board delay.    As previously reported, the new monitoring of trading in the Pink Sheets companies' stock is part of the NASD's stepped-up attention to a sometimes shadowy part of the over-the-counter market. Previously, the only available sources of information the NASD had for surveillance of non-Nasdaq OTC stocks were periodic, on-site examinations of member firms or follow-ups of customer complaints. </TEXT></DOC>
