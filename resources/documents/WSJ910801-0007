The good news-bad news reports are typical for the end ofa recession, but they also lend support to the view that therecovery will be torpid. Recent increases in the leadingindicators have been &quot;much less than in a typical recovery,but we haven't been expecting a typical recovery,&quot; saidRobert Dederick, economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago.</LP><TEXT>   The index of leading indicators climbed 0.5% in June afterincreasing 0.8% the month before, the Commerce Departmentsaid. A companion index that is supposed to track the currentstate of the economy rose for the third month, another signthat the recession is over.   The department also said factory orders fell by 1.4% to$233.31 billion in June, breaking a two-month string ofincreases greater than 2%. The downturn in orders waswidespread. Orders fell 1.4% for both durable goods, thoseintended to last more than three years, and non-durablegoods. The department last week estimated that orders fordurable goods fell 1.6% in June.   Mr. Dederick said the decline didn't suggest that theeconomy is about to slide back into a recession, but ratherrepresented an unsurprising correction after two surprisinglystrong months.   Factory inventories declined, a signal that manufacturerswill have to step up production promptly if orders perk up,and factory shipments were up. But backlogs of unfilledorders declined for the fourth month and are now at theirlowest since November 1989, a worrisome sign.   Five of the 11 components of the leading index werepositive: the length of the average workweek, consumerexpectations, claims for unemployment benefits, buildingpermits and the speed with which vendors supply factories.Five others were negative, several of which reflect theweakness in manufacturing in June. They were orders forconsumer goods, factory backlogs, the money supply, materialsprices and orders for new plant and equipment. One component,stock prices, was a wash.   The leading indicators don't reflect the latest revisionsto the factory orders data. Commerce Department economistssaid they couldn't immediately determine if the leadingindicators would have risen more or less had the latestfigures been used.   ---                      FACTORY ORDERS                                                                                                          Here are the Commerce Department's latest figures formanufacturers in billions of dollars, seasonally adjusted.
