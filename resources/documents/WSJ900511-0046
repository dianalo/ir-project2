In European spot markets, North Sea crudes generally wereup five cents to 10 cents a barrel. In the U.S. futuresmarket, active trading pushed West Texas Intermediate crudefor June delivery up more than 30 cents a barrel, suggestingat one point a possible repeat of Wednesday's gain of 71cents a barrel.</LP><TEXT>   But the June crude contract failed to go higher than$19.31 a barrel, and profit-taking in late trading brought itback from there. Still, it settled at $19.02, up three cents,while July delivery West Texas was up four cents to $19.48 abarrel.   Traders generally cited three factors for the gains: theimpact of labor troubles in North Sea oil fields, theemerging demand for &quot;sweet&quot; low-sulfur crudes with the biggasoline season near, and a growing belief among oil-marketparticipants that members of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries will honor last week's agreement to cutoutput by nearly 1.5 million barrels a day.   &quot;There is a definite change in sentiment on thatagreement,&quot; said William Hinton, a Stotler andamp; Co. energyfutures broker.   The OPEC agreement was initially greeted skeptically inworld oil markets. But several leading OPEC members havesince given strong signals of plans to do their part toimplement the agreement.   Among the more vocal in making such pledges have beenSaudi Arabia, Iraq, Iran, Algeria, Nigeria and Indonesia. InIraq, an oil ministry official said yesterday that IssamAbdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, the Iraqi minister, will go toRiyadh tomorrow to meet with Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's oilminister, on the OPEC efforts.   Mr. Nazer has been in the U.S. since last weekend for ameeting in New York of the board of Saudi Arabian Oil Co. andto visit facilities of Star Enterprise, the Saudi venturewith Texaco Inc. He was to return to Saudi Arabia after atrip to New Orleans yesterday. But before leaving Geneva,where OPEC held its meeting, Mr. Nazer told reporters healready had informed Saudi customers to expect cuts.   Saudi Arabia and two other major Persian Gulf producers,Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, have been in thelimelight since oil prices began falling sharply some weeksago because each has been producing well beyond its OPECquota. Indeed, the three should account for the bulk of thereductions called for in the OPEC pact.   According to Dow Jones International Petroleum Report, AbuDhabi, the chief member of the United Arab Emirates, hasasked several of its contract buyers to reduce the amount ofcrude oil they plan to take this month. It wasn't immediatelyclear, however, whether the reductions would total as much asthe 200,000 barrels a day that Mana Said Otaiba, theemirates' oil minister, pledged to cut.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices edged higher. The May contract,which will cease trading on May 29, rose 1.30 cents a poundto $1.2570. July advanced 0.90 cent a pound to $1.1840.During trading, both contracts established freshlife-of-contract highs, May at $1.2710 and July at $1.1925.The premiums of nearer positions over more deferred onescontinued to widen in New York and London. New York tended toreflect the strength in London, where there was active demandfor copper from merchants, an analyst said. In Peru, therewas still concern that workers at Centromin, which is a majorPeruvian mining firm but a relatively minor copper producer,may walk out. Also in Peru, labor negotiations are continuingbetween Southern Peru Copper Corp. and unions, even thoughemployees have returned to work after an eight-week strike.Both developments created uncertainty that was reflected infirmer prices, an analyst said.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Silver futures rose while gold andplatinum eased. July delivery silver finished 5.7 cents anounce higher at $5.15. June gold retreated $1.80 an ounce to$371.90. July platinum declined $1.90 an ounce to $484.60.There has been sporadic demand from the Far East for silverover the past month, an analyst said. As a result, demand forfutures contracts pushed prices higher, he said. The Julysilver contract thrust above the key resistance level of$5.11 and, when resting buying orders were touched off, therally ran up to $5.18 before receding, the analyst said.Platinum at first was firm on some demand for the metal inJapan, but later slipped in sympathy with gold, the analystsaid. Separately, the Silver Institute, a Washington,D.C.-based industry group, announced that it had retained CPMGroup, a New York precious metals research company, toproduce the World Silver Survey, an annual review of theinternational silver market, to be published later this year.John Lutley, executive director of the institute, noted thatthe gold and platinum industries have authoritative sourcesof figures, but that similar sources of silver informationhad disappeared as a result of a decline in trading of themetal in recent years. &quot;The gold industry has ConsolidatedGold Fields, which spends a half-million {pounds sterling}annually and sends an army of people around the world togather information on gold, and platinum has Johnson Matthey,another major international firm, which collects facts andfigures and analyzes the platinum market in depth,&quot; he said.CPM Group, whose managing director is Jeffrey M. Christian,is expected to fill that gap in silver, Mr. Lutley said.</TEXT></DOC>
