We would like to vanish the enemy from thecity and then start moving out.''   The report could not be confirmed independently.   Amani gave few details but said there was fighting north andeast of the city, and 37 guerrillas have been killed and 27 woundedsince Monday night.   Despite the counterattacks, the U.S.-backed Moslem rebels firedrockets into Jalalabad late Monday and Tuesday that killed fourcivilians and a government soldier and destroyed 11 houses and amosque, according to Amani. He did not mention other casualtiesamong the government forces at Jalalabad, 75 miles east of thecapital of Kabul.   Amani also reported a battle at Sarobin, about half way betweenJalalabad and Kabul and 15 rebels trying to block the main supplyhighway were slain.   He said three rockets struck Kabul early Tuesday but reported nocasualties.   Amani's report indicated the Marxist government of PresidentNajib was making a major effort to lift the siege of Jalalabad thatbegan March 6 when guerrillas captured the nearby garrison town ofSamarkel.   Amani said Samarkel was retaken by government forces but he hadno reports about the surrounding districts.   The rebels' siege of Jalalabad has been their most concentratedand sustained effort since the Soviet Union withdrew its remainingtroops from Afghanistan in mid-February. The Soviets sent troopsinto Afghanistan in December 1979 and for years had more than100,000 military personnel in the country in an unsuccessful effortto crush the revolt.   Government sources said Tuesday that troops were preparing for arebel assault on the southern city of Kandahar and repeated theclaim that Pakistan would provide support for the guerrillas.   Kandahar, about 300 miles southwest of Kabul, is considered morevulnerable than Jalalabad.   Najib has claimed Pakistan is deploying about 15,000 soldiersacross the border near Quetta to help in an attack on Kandahar, 60miles west of the frontier. Quetta is 50 miles east of the border.   The sources, speaking on the condition they not be identified,said the rebels were expected to launch the attack this week tomark the end of a three-day feast following the Islamic holy monthof Ramadan.   The rebels have been trying to capture an Afghan city for a basefor their government-in-exile they established in February inPakistan.   Pakistan and the United States have provided supplies to therebels but Pakistan has denied repeated claims by the Afghangovernment that it is sending troops into Afghanistan to suport therebels.   The Soviet Union continues to supply weapons and ammunition toNajib's troops.   Before the civil war began more than 10 years ago, Kandahar wasAfghanistan's second-largest city after Kabul. But tens ofthousands of people fled the city because of the fighting, andgovernment officials say they don't know how many remain.</TEXT></DOC>
