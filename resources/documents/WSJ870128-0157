Maj. Dawit says the desire of the Eritrean people is &quot;regional autonomy.&quot; From his own experience he knows this is not true and that we are fighting for our independence. The case of Eritrea is one of decolonization. Eritrea is a former Italian colony federated with Ethiopia against the wishes of the majority of Eritreans and later forcibly annexed by Ethiopia. The Eritreans have been fighting for more than 25 years for their independence. They, under the leadership of the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, would prefer to solve the problem peacefully but the Ethiopian government, under both former Emperor Haile Selassie and the current military junta led by Mengistu Haile-Mariam, recognizes only a military solution.    Maj. Dawit attempts to dissociate himself from Col. Mengistu and the military solution by calling for &quot;negotiations&quot; for &quot;regional autonomy.&quot; In reality, his position is no different from that of Col. Mengistu. The present government calls for negotiations for regional autonomy while continuing to pursue a military solution, and Maj. Dawit was active in enforcing that policy. For many years he served in the Second Division in Eritrea. He was the leading Ethiopian in Eritrea during the 1982 Red Star Campaign that resulted in thousands of Eritreans being imprisoned, killed, displaced or forced to flee the country.    There is no difference between Maj. Dawit and Col. Mengistu except that one is in power and one is not. If Maj. Dawit were sincere about seeking a political solution through negotiation, he would come out boldly in recognition of the Eritreans' right to self-determination. Instead he chooses to ignore alternatives such as the EPLF proposal for an internationally supervised referendum in Eritrea that would allow the people to choose among continued association with Ethiopia, regional autonomy (Col. Mengistu's and Maj. Dawit's &quot;solution&quot;) or independence.    The Eritreans suffered because of Maj. Dawit when he was in Eritrea and in Addis Ababa. He is no longer in a position to contribute to our suffering but, now that he is abroad, we wish he would improve his outlook and work actively to find a real solution.    Hagos Ghebrehiwet   Representative to U.S. and Canada    Eritrean People's Liberation Front   New York   ---   The article of Maj. Dawit concerning the means by which the Communist government of Col. Mengistu controls Ethiopia by deliberate starvation is excellent. His statement that the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie commenced with years of relative peace and hope could be amplified.    When his country was invaded in 1934 by Fascist Italy, Selassie unsuccessfully appealed to the League of Nations. His forces fought valiantly without significant modern arms until crushed and occupied in 1935. After Ethiopia's liberation by Britain in 1941, Selassie returned, declared war on Japan as well as Germany and Italy, and dispatched Ethiopian forces to fight with the Allies until the end of World War II.    When the U.N. decided to defend South Korea against Communist forces in 1952, Emperor Haile Selassie, remembering his own rebuff by the League, supplied the U.N. with more Ethiopian armed forces per capita than any other nation.    Maj. Dawit's statement that in 1974 Haile Selassie had political opposition from students and Western-educated elite is true. His fall, however, was caused by the U.S. Congress, which in 1973 cut off funding for arms to Vietnam and Portugal as well as Ethiopia, allowing Vietnam, the Portuguese African empire and Ethiopia to drop behind the Iron Curtain.    Haile Selassie was a hero who understood that freedom from forces of both the right and the left requires national sacrifice.    Edward C. Michaud Jr.   Weston, Mass.</TEXT></DOC>
