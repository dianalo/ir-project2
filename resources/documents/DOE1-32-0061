<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-32-0061 </DOCNO><TEXT>The full catalytic cycle of olefin hydrogenation by the Wilkinson catalysthas been studied with the ab initio MO method. The reaction mechanismconsists of a sequence of elementary reaction steps: the oxidative additionof H/sub 2/ to RhCl(PR/sub 3/)/sub 2/, the coordination of ethylene to(H)/sub 2/RhCl(PR/sub 3/)/sub 2/, the olefin insertion in (H)/sub 2/RhCl(PR/sub3/)/sub 2/(C/sub 2/H/sub 4/), the isomerization of HRhCl(PR/sub 3/)(C/sub2/H/sub 5/), and the reductive elimination of ethane to regenerate RhCl9PR/sub3/)/sub 2/. Detailed analysis of each elementary reaction step and comparisonwith similar reactions studied previously will be made as well.</TEXT></DOC>
