A letter printed in Friday's Journal of the American MedicalAssociation said one man who injected the drug into his urethrasuffered gangrene that led to the amputation of both his legs, ninefingers and his penis.   It was not clear how this use of cocaine led to such``extravagant complications,'' Dr. John C. Mahler and twocolleagues at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center said inthe letter.   The 34-year-old patient, who was not identified, was admitted tothe hospital with an abnormally persistent erection he said hadstarted three days before, accompanied by painful swelling, thedoctors said.   The patient told doctors that prior to having sexual intercoursein previous weeks, he had occasionally injected cocaine into hisurethra, the tube that carries urine out of the body.   The patient said he had taken the drug ``to enhance sexualperformance,'' the doctors said.   After three days of treatment, the erection and swellingdisappeared, but the patient began developing blood clots in hislimbs, genitals, back and chest, and skin problems so severe thatthe patient had to be moved to the hospital's burn unit.   Eventually, due to necrosis and gangrene, or the death oftissue, doctors amputated the man's legs above his knee, nine ofhis fingers and his penis.   The New York doctors said they were reporting the 1987 case towarn doctors about ``this new method of cocaine abuse and ... itsrare and previously unreported complications.''   Injection or topical application of cocaine to sexual organs ina bid to heighten sexual pleasure has been reported but is notbelieved to be a widespread practice, according to experts onsexuality and drug abuse cited in Friday's editions of The New YorkTimes.   Dr. John Money, an expert in sexuality at Johns Hopkins MedicalSchool in Baltimore, expressed doubts whether cocaine alone couldhave produced the severe complications cited in the letter.   Some other factor, such as an impurity in the drug, may havebeen the cause, he said.   Mahler said his team had considered such a possibility, butfound no evidence to document it.</TEXT></DOC>
