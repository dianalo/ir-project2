Refugehunting programs are reviewed annually to determine whether the regulationsgoverning individual refuge hunts should be modified, deleted or addedto. Changing environmental conditions, state and Federal regulations, andother factors affecting wildlife populations and habitats may warrant modificationsto ensure the continued compatibility of hunting with the purposes forwhich the individual refuges involved were established and, to the extentpractical, make refuge hunting programs consistent with state regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>December 7, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Larry LaRochelle, Division ofRefuges, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, 18th and C Streets NW., MS 670-ARLSQ,Washington, DC 20240; Telephone (703) 358-2043.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>50 CFR part 32 contains provisionsgoverning hunting on national wildlife refuges. Hunting is regulated onrefuges to (1) ensure compatibility with refuge purposes, (2) properlymanage the wildlife resource, (3) protect other refuge values, and (4)ensure refuge user safety. On many refuges, the Service policy of adoptingstate hunting regulations is adequate in meeting these objectives. On otherrefuges, it is necessary to supplement State regulations with more restrictiveFederal regulations to ensure that the Service meets its management responsibilities,as outlined under the section entitled ``Conformance with Statutory andRegulatory Authorities.'' Refuge-specific hunting regulations may be issuedonly after a wildlife refuge is opened to migratory game bird, upland game,or big game hunting through publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. These regulations may list the wildlife speciesthat may be hunted, seasons, bag limits, methods of hunting, descriptionsof open areas, and other provisions. Previously issued refuge-specificregulations for migratory game bird, upland game, and big game huntingare contained in 50 CFR 32.12, 32.22, and 32.32 respectively. Many of theamendments to these sections are being promulgated to standardize and clarifythe existing language of these regulations.The policy of the Department of the Interior is, whenever practicable,to afford the public an opportunity to participate in the rulemaking process.In the July 28, 1989, issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4> beginning on page 31348 the Service publisheda proposed rulemaking the amend certain reguations in 50 CFR part 32 andinvited the public to comment. The Service's responses to those commentsare contained in the following section.<ITAG tagnum="84"> Responses to Comments Received</ITAG>Written comments on the proposed rule were received from six parties opposingthe proposed horsepower restrictions on the use of electric motors on Unit9 of the Lower Klamath National Wildlife Refuge in California and Oregon.The Service is therefore withdrawing those proposals. No other commentswere received on the Service's proposals nor were any received concerninginformation collection under the Paperwork Reduction Act.Conformance With Statutory and Regulatory Authorities The National WildlifeRefuge System Administration Act (NWRSAA) of 1966, as amended (16 U.S.C.668dd), and the Refuge Recreation Act of 1962 (16 U.S.C. 460k) govern theadministration and public use of national wildlife refuges. Specifically,section 4(d)(1)(A) of the NWRSAA authorizes the Secretary of the Interiorto permit the use of any area within the Refuge System for any purpose,including but not limited to, hunting, fishing and public recreation, accommodationsand access, when he determines that such uses are compatible with the majorpurpose(s) for which the area was established.The Refuge Recreation Act authorizes the Secretary to administer areaswithin the Refuge System for public recreation as an appropriate incidentalor secondary use only to the extent that it is practicable and not inconsistentwith the primary purpose(s) for which the areas were established. The RefugeRecreation Act also authorizes the Secretary to issue regulations to carryout the purposes of the Act. Hunting plans are developed for each refugeprior to opening it to hunting. In many cases, refuge-specific huntingregulations are included in the hunting plan to ensure the compatibilityof the hunting programs with the purposes for which the refuge was established.Initial compliance with the NWRSAA and Refuge Recreation Act is ensuredwhen hunting plans are developed, and the determinations required by theseacts are made prior to the addition of refuges to the lists of areas opento hunting in 50 CFR. Continued compliance is ensured by annual reviewof hunting programs and regulations.Considering the rapidly approaching hunting seasons and the ones presentlytaking place, there is an immediate need to place these regulations intoeffect. The absence of refuge-specific hunting regulations for these huntingseasons would be contrary to the public interest (confusion on hours, baglimits, or firearm restrictions), and wildlife conservation. Thus, theDepartment concludes that good cause exists within the meaning of 5 U.S.C.553(d)(3) to make these regulations effective upon publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Effect</ITAG>Executive Order 12291 requires the preparation of regulatory impact analysesfor major rules. A major rule is one likely to result in an annual effecton the economy of $100 million or more; or a major increase in costs orprices for consumers, individual industries, government agencies or geographicregions. The Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) further requires the preparation of flexibility analysesfor rules that will have a significant effect on a substantial number ofsmall entities, which include small businesses, organizations or governmentaljurisdictions.These amendments to the codified refuge-specific hunting regulations makerelatively minor adjustments to existing hunting programs. The regulationsare not expected to have any gross economic effect and will not cause anincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal,state, or local governments, agencies, or geographic regions. The benefitsaccruing to the public are expected to exceed by a large margin the costsof administering this rule. Accordingly, the Department of the Interiorhas determined that this rule is not a ``major rule'' within the meaningof E.O. 12291 and will not have a significant economic effect on a substantialnumber of small entities within the meaning of the Regulatory FlexibilityAct.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The Service has approval from the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)for the information collection requirements of these regulations pursuantto the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). These requirements are presently approved by OMB ascited below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,9</C> <H1>Type of Information Collection</H1><H1>OMB Approval No.</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Economic and public use permits <D>1018-0014</D></ITAG></ITAG>Public reporting burden for this form is estimated to average six (6) minutesper response, including time for reviewing instructions, gathering andmaintaining data, and completing and reviewing the form.

Refuge-specific hunting regulations aresubject to a categorical exclusion from the NEPA process if they do notsignificantly alter the existing use of a particular national wildliferefuge.
