In trying those charged in the Recruit scandal, prosecutors mustshow when a gift becomes a bribe. The determination by the courtcould become a severe test of the close links between business andgovernment in Japan.   The answers won't be known in full for years, given the slowpace of justice in Japan.   ``The Recruit case is not just another political corruptiontrial but it is a challenge to the way Japan Inc. is set uptoday,'' said Hiroshi Itakura, professor of criminal law at NipponUniversity, using a term that refers to the close postwarcooperation between business and government.   ``For those implicated in the case, it is almost as if they weredoing what everyone else was doing, and one day they woke up andfound themselves being criminal defendants in one of the largestbribery cases in history,'' he said.   The scandal centers on an ambitious entrepreneur, Hiromasa Ezoe,who showered senior politicians and bureaucrats with huge donationsand discounted shares in a subsidiary of his conglomerate, RecruitCo.   Because the alleged corruption was so widespread, the scandalcaused public uproar and forced Noboru Takeshita to step down asprime minister in June. Takeshita was found to have received $1.4million in questionable yet legal donations from Recruit.   The scandal drove dozens of powerful men out of the politicallimelight and directly contributed to the governing LiberalDemocratic Party's unprecedented defeat in an election for theupper house of Parliament in July.   The party still is struggling with the influence-peddlingscandal ahead of elections expected early next year for the morepowerful lower house. The trials starting in Tokyo District Courtraise the possibility of further damaging disclosures.   After an eight-month investigation by the Tokyo District PublicProsecutor's Office, two politicians, six bureaucrats and fourRecruit executives, including Ezoe, were charged with bribery,which carries a maximum five-year prison sentence.   Five separate trials will start between Friday and Dec. 15, withthe first involving Takashi Kato, a former vice minister of labor,and Masao Tatsumi, a former Recruit executive. Tatsumi is chargedwith bribing Kato with 3,000 shares in a Recruit subsidiary to helpRecruit's publishing business.   Defendants whose trials start later include Takao Fujinami, aformer chief Cabinet secretary, and Hisashi Shinto, ex-chairman ofNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp., Japan's largest company.   Analysts say prosecutors are likely to encounter difficulties insubstantiating bribery because sending gifts and donations topoliticians and bureaucrats is a common business practice.   The Japanese exchange gifts not only on special occasions likebirthdays and holidays, but also are virtually required to bringsomething when only visiting friends.   Guests commonly give $140 to $210 at weddings or funerals.College students often give gifts to professors. According to a1988 survey, an average Japanese family spends $1,040 a year ongifts.   ``If you are a Japanese and visit your friend empty-handed, yourfriend will probably think you are strange if he does not getoffended,'' said Tetsuro Murobushi, who has writen many books onpolitical corruption.   ``The question in the Recruit case is whether a cleardistinction between bribe and gift can be established or not.''   Japanese companies can legally make up to $210,000 in politicaldonations a year, and they have skirted this limit by buyingtickets to politicians' fund-raising parties. Companies also treatpoliticians and public officials to dinners and golf outings.   Corporate managers say such treatment is not aimed at winningspecific favors but to keep close relations with supervisingagencies and politicians, who may make their business easier in thelong run.   ``In Japan, gifts function as a lubricant between businesspartners, neighbors, teachers and students and politicians andbusinessmen,'' said Itakura.   ``Strictly speaking, all of them are bribery by Westernstandards and I personally think it's not a desirable custom,'' hesaid. ``But if you are a businessman and if you don't send giftswhile everyone else does, you are likely to end up losing businessto your competitors.''</TEXT></DOC>
