And they are using the events to help call world attention to their appeal for an end to Chinese rule.    &quot;We did it. We finally did it,&quot; a young Tibetan exclaimed after the latest demonstration, last Thursday. &quot;We had been planning this revolt since 1959,&quot; says an elderly, maroon-robed monk at Tibet's venerable Drepung monastery, where the pungent smoke from yak-butter lamps permeates the air. &quot;On Sept. 27 we finally proclaimed our independence from China.&quot;    On that Sunday, 26 monks -- 21 from Drepung -- marched five times around the holy road that rings the Jokhang temple, the spiritual center of Tibetan Buddhism. They carried the outlawed Tibetan flag and cried out for Tibetan independence. Police stopped the march, arrested the monks and beat several of them.    The rally fizzled, but it inspired a second, bigger one the following Thursday, Oct. 1. About 35 monks circled the temple, again proclaiming independence for Tibet. Again the police arrested the monks, clubbing one with a shovel. Lhasa erupted.    Thousands of Tibetan men and women stoned the police, overturned and torched several official vehicles and burned down a police station where monks were being detained. At one point, a crowd of Tibetans caved in the door of the burning police station to free the monks. As they hoisted one of the monks -- smiling triumphantly despite severe burns to his face and arms -- on their shoulders, men and women in the crowd sobbed.    The police responded to the demonstrations with gunfire. By the end of the day, an estimated nine people were dead, including three monks and, apparently, some policemen. The official death toll was six.    In the 1959 uprising put down by Chinese troops, thousands of monks were killed or fled to India with their spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama, who has been in exile since the revolt 28 years ago. During China's Cultural Revolution, a 10-year period of chaos that began in the mid-1960s, radical Red Guards in Tibet attacked monks, destroyed religious artifacts and tore down or closed temples and monasteries.    Beijing has been making amends, rebuilding damaged religious buildings and reopening monasteries. The Drepung monastery, for example, was severely damaged in the Cultural Revolution, its ancient books and other artifacts stolen or destroyed. The monastery, nestled in the hills overlooking Lhasa, was reopened in 1981, though the government has limited the number of monks there to 450, in contrast to 10,000 before 1950.    The Chinese also have tried to soften their admittedly heavy-handed rule in Tibet and for the past several years have been urging the Dalai Lama to return. But the Chinese appear unwilling to let him have a civil function in addition to his religious role, and he has stayed in exile.    More demonstrations are possible. All of Lhasa is waiting for tomorrow, the 37th anniversary of China's military takeover in 1950. &quot;We have to demonstrate again on Wednesday,&quot; says a young Tibetan member of the underground. &quot;If we don't, it will mean we have been defeated.&quot; As a precaution, China has flown in senior police officers from Beijing and beefed up security all over the city. Tourists yesterday reported seeing planeloads of security troops arriving at Lhasa's airport.    &quot;This is something we are willing to die for,&quot; says the Drepung monk. &quot;They can kill us, but the Dalai Lama will live on.&quot;    Monks in Lhasa yesterday distributed copies of an appeal for world support. &quot;The Chinese have ruled violently in our country and we want them to leave Tibet,&quot; the appeal said. &quot;We ask the United Nations and all the countries of the world to please support our true cause. We are suffering.&quot;    The appeal called the Dalai Lama &quot;our leader forever.&quot; Monks also said a letter, dated Sept. 29, had been sent by the leaders of three monasteries to the United Nations, calling for an independent Tibet.    Last week's violent demonstrations caught the Chinese and the international community by surprise. But at Drepung, the monks had been waiting for the right moment. The moment came after the Dalai Lama's well-publicized visit to the U.S. last month, during which he called for an independent Tibet. The monks were also angered by China's critical reaction to the visit.    &quot;They told us that the Dalai Lama could be our spiritual leader, but that politically he was rubbish,&quot; says the monk, who requested anonymity. &quot;That made us furious.&quot;    There also were supernatural signs. &quot;On the 25th, a giant rainbow arched itself above Drepung,&quot; the monk says. &quot;The following day there were tremors in the earth. These were signs. On the 27th, we decided to lead the demonstration.&quot;    The first march was led by young monks from Drepung. Early on Sept. 27, they circled Jokhang temple, pulled out home-made blue and white flags representing an independent Tibet and chanted, &quot;Independence for Tibet. We are free.&quot;    While the state-controlled Chinese media contend that the Dalai Lama and his supporters instigated the demonstrations, the effect of outside influence, if any, isn't clear. Tibetans who fled to India and Nepal travel in and out of Tibet bringing news of the world. The Dalai Lama's visit to the U.S was known to many Tibetans here. In the U.S. two weeks ago, he met with members of the House human rights caucus and criticized Chinese treatment of Tibetans.    Many Tibetans also were aware of two amendments, tacked onto a State Department authorization bill by the House in June, that criticized China's &quot;violation of human rights&quot; and military &quot;occupation&quot; of Tibet. China rejected the charges, calling them &quot;serious distortions&quot; and reminding the U.S. that it and most other nations recognize China's sovereignty over Tibet.    Some foreigners took part in the riots, eyewitnesses said. Police detained several, confiscating cameras and notebooks. Two Americans were detained briefly and ordered to leave Tibet within 10 days for alleged involvement.    China is particularly sensitive about Tibet. The region is rich in minerals, and its proximity to India makes it strategically important to Beijing. Earlier this year, Chinese and Indian troops clashed at the border.    Beijing has been extremely sensitive to world opinion about Tibet. China has historically claimed suzerainty over Tibet, and Chinese troops moved into the region in 1950, a year after the Communists took control in Beijing. China maintains an estimated 250,000 troops here. The Chinese also moved an estimated one million civilians here to live with the two million Tibetans, leading to charges that Beijing is trying to destroy Tibetan culture and replace it with its own.    China calls Tibet an autonomous region, and grants a limited amount of self-rule. Until the demonstrations, Tibetan discontent seemed to be waning, particularly in the capital of Lhasa, as the Chinese brought economic improvements and opened the door to tourism and foreign currency. But judging from last week's riots, anti-Chinese feelings remain deep.    Since the demonstrations, Chinese police have gone to monasteries in and around Lhasa seeking to find out which monks participated. Police tore down pictures of the Dalai Lama that hung at Drepung. But monks immediately pasted up new ones.    &quot;The Chinese say they will welcome the Dalai Lama to return,&quot; says a monk at Drepung. &quot;But if they rip his picture down like this, what will they do with him when he returns?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
