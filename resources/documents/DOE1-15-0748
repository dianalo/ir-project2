Work is currently underway in our laboratory to identifymutagenic members of this class of compounds utilizing different methodology.We have recently developed six monoclonal antibodies named IQ-1, IQ-2,AIA-1, AIA-2, AIA-4, and AIA-7 which have shown promise in immunoassaysspecific for cooked food mutagens. Each of the antibodies has it's ownselectivity profile for the mutagens resulting in some antibodies whichare compound specific and some which are specific for the entire AIAclass. We demonstrated the utility of these antibodies by showing thata high-mutagen extract of cooked meat had much more immunologically cross-reactivecomponents than a low-mutagen extract. These antibodies also cross-reactwith mouse microsomal metabolites of 4,8-DiMeIQx. We hope to use theseantibodies to help isolate previously unidentified members of the AIAclass and to screen food items for specific mutagenic components. 27refs.</TEXT></DOC>
