Hurricane Dalilia weakened to a tropical storm early Wednesday,but the National Weather Service continued to warn people _especially residents of the island of Hawaii _ to brace for heavyrains and high winds.   At 2 a.m. HST Thursday (8 a.m. EDT today), the storm was about185 miles south of Honolulu, moving northwest at 13 mph and waspredicted to slowly weaken, according to the weather service.   The weather service said that was likely the closest it wouldcome to the state. The storm was 210 miles south-southeast of Oahu,the most populous island, and was expected to pass within 100 milesof it today.   Its maximum sustained wind speed was 63 mph; a storm isclassified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74 mph. Wind gustedto 80 mph.   In Naalehu, the southernmost community in the United States,residents braced for the worst, but were optimistic they would notneed the water, canned goods, batteries and candles they had hoarded.   A tropical storm watch for Hawaii Island, the southernmost in thechain, was upgraded Wednesday to a tropical storm warning, meaningresidents could expect winds up to 73 mph, heavy rains, flooding andhigher than normal surf. A flash flood warning also was in effect.   A flash flood watch _ less urgent than a warning _ was issuedWednesday night for Oahu, Maui, Kauai, Molokai and Lanai as theweather service reported heavy rain throughout the state.   ``Because it seems to staying on a course that will bring itparallel to the islands, we think the main problem might be from therain; hopefully the winds won't be too extreme, but we might getsome flooding'' said Hans Rosendal, a weather service forecaster.   Hawaii Island beach parks were closed for the second day as surfsurged to more than 15 feet on the southeast coast.</TEXT></DOC>
