The vice president said he was ready for the final nationallybroadcast campaign debate, which starts at 9 p.m. EDT Thursday onthe UCLA campus.   ``We do tend to be a little stronger politically these days. Butwhat I want to do is have them (viewers) understand what myheartbeat is, what I really care about,'' he told reporters at abreakfast meeting with Los Angeles police chief Daryl Gates, aRepublican supporter.   Asked about his goals for the next debate, Bush replied, ``It'sless statistics ... than it is how I would like to lead thiscountry, where I'd like to see us by the 90s. So I want to spell itout in a broader sense this time. Let the others nitpick on allthese little numbers.''   He said he would keep portraying Dukakis as a liberal. ``Hecannot run away from his past,'' the vice president said.   Bush spent most of the day working with debate coach Richard G.Darman, the former deputy treasury secretary who played the role ofDukakis for the first presidential debate Sept. 25, and studyingbriefing papers alone.   Other debate coaches, including media adviser Roger Ailes, werearriving later today.   The relatively quiet day in Los Angeles comes on the heels of aSeattle appearance Tuesday that was disrupted by a shouting Jesuitpriest.   The Rev. Bill Bichsel, who works with the homeless in Tacoma,Wash., was forcibly removed from the hall by police after he stoodup in the audience and yelled out his objections to Reaganadministration policies.   His words could not be heard clearly over the loud publicaddress system Bush was using and the vice president continuedspeaking. At one point, Bush stopped and took note of the protester.   ``Isn't this a great country. You can run into all kinds ofcharacters in my line of work. This one's ... amazing,'' he said.   Bichsel said he was given a citation for criminal trespassingand was released. A police spokesman in Seattle was unavailable forcomment.   Bush continued to pound out the anti-crime theme that hisadvisers have targeted as a vote-getter in the waning weeks of thecampaign. But the focus Tuesday was on white-collar crime.   Bush told the audience of Seattle University business studentshe would ``throw the book at white-collar criminals as hard as wethrow it at other criminals.''   ``The fact is that most of the people on Wall Street are honest,hard working people. And beyond that, much of the money made tereis recycled to foundations to help the poor, universities and otherworthy causes,'' he said.   ``But abuse will rear its ugly head without vigorous lawenforcement,'' he said.   Bush also accused Dukakis of ``protectionist demagoguery''because of Dukakis' recent statements against foreign ownership ofU.S. industry.   ``For political reasons, he sees advantage in stoking fearsabout foreign influence,'' Bush charged.   ``My opponent needs an issue, and he's willing to scare peopleto find it,'' he said, accusing his opponent of flip-flopping onthe protection issues and being a ``believe-nothing candidate.''</TEXT></DOC>
