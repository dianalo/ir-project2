The framework for this long-termassessment has three main features: an economic evaluation criterion,an economic evaluation viewpoint, and conventional energy price and demandprojections. Within this framework, several solar technologies are evaluatedand two solar heating market development scenarios are elaborated. Itis concluded that Canadian solar energy policy should continue to emphasizesolar heating rather than solar-electric generation . The potential forsolar heating first and foremost relies on whether the cost reductionand performance improvements projected here are achieved. It is alsoconcluded that large-scale solar electric technologies for producinggrid electricty will not be competitive with conventional alternativesin the foreseeable future, and that the non-grid photovoltataic usesin Canada are very small from a national energy supply perspective butthat photovoltaic industry development in Canada could well be successful,primarily serving a large export market. 13 figs., 69 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
