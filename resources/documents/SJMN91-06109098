Assuming privacy, she made extensive fun of agovernment official to whom she was always courteous in person. Within a fewdays, the official turned up at her door, angrily accusing her of being&quot;mean.&quot; He never explained why.;    Cases like these lead many journalists tosuspect the government of bugging their phones. A Salinas spokesman, LeonardoFfrench, however, explicitly denied knowledge of such a practice.;    &quot;I crossmy heart. I give you my word of honor,&quot; vowed Ffrench, who attributedreporters' and activists' suspicions to &quot;rumors and a certain degree ofparanoia.&quot;;    After reading the human-rights commission's bulletin, however,Ffrench called back to denounce the reported incident as an &quot;outrageous . . .violation of human rights,&quot; and suggested that a special attorney be appointedto investigate it, a move that would circumvent the federal attorney general'soffice.;    Some critics have pointed to that office, long at odds with thecommission, as being responsible for the tapping. A spokesman for the attorneygeneral denied any responsibility in the incident.;    To be sure, none of thecase studies collected so far by the correspondents' group offers confirmationof government tapping. Some nonetheless seem suspicious.;    Guillermo Garcia,who worked in Mexico for the Cox News Service during the previous presidentialadministration, said he was once called in by a government spokesman whocomplained about a story he had written. The official was reading from a textthat had all of his original spelling errors intact, leading Garcia to assumeit had been intercepted as he had sent it by means of his computer modem.;   &quot;You've got to assume every newspaper editor or columnist or TV commentator --anyone in a position to hurt them -- is under regular surveillance,&quot; saidWashington financial analyst Christopher Whalen, a prominent critic of theSalinas government.;    Whalen said he travels four or five times a year toCalifornia to meet Mexican opposition figures and economists who won't talk tohim by phone.;    &quot;I know Mexicans who will take a plane to Texas to sit in aphone booth all day&quot; to avoid taps, he said.;    Others take a chance oncounter-surveillance. On edge after overexposure to the rumor mill, thisreporter recently bought a $75 &quot;telephone tap detector.&quot; It came withguarantees that it would signal the presence of a third person on the line byflashing a red light, while a green light would flash if the line wereunmonitored.;    A two-month test rendered inconclusive results. On mostinternational calls, the light flashed red. But the light also flashed red,then back to green, when a friend with a particularly loud voice was on theline.;    &quot;We can never be 100 percent sure&quot; of government surveillance, saidone reporter for a prominent U.S. news organization.;    He then referred tothe officials he nonetheless suspects by an unprintable epithet, saying, &quot;Thedelicious irony is no way can they come back and complain, because then wewould have proof.&quot;;    The reporter's wife offers her own tapping story. Afterbuying a washing machine, which immediately broke down, she made repeatedcalls to the store that had sold it to her, growing increasingly frustrated asoperators shunted her from office to office.;    While she was waiting on holdon one call, a voice came on the line, sounding far away, to say: &quot;We are themonitors. We know about all the calls you've made.&quot;;    The voice -- giving into what seemed an irresistible chivalrous urge -- went on to advise that shecomplain to the attorney general's office about the store's lack of attention.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  KATHERINE ELLISON, Mercury News Mexico City Bureau  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Mexico City  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910418  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  April  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  761  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday April 18, 199100109098,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
