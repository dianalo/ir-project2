A group of senior-ranking Western officials had beenscheduled to gather in Paris yesterday and today to finishrewriting guidelines on which computers, telecommunicationsequipment and other technology products the alliedgovernments will license for shipment to Moscow and itsformer Warsaw Pact members. But disagreement among theWestern allies prompted a postponement of the meeting untilat least April, a U.S. Embassy spokesman in Paris said.</LP><TEXT>   Among the major disputes are proposed new limits on thesophistication of fiber-optic telecommunications equipmentthat could be exported to the Soviets, a U.S. governmentofficial said. While Germany and five other European nationsare urging a major liberalization of the rules, the U.S.,Britain, Canada and Australia have been urging caution -- andfor some products a tightening of trade rules -- lest the newtelecommunications systems make it harder for the West toeavesdrop electronically on Soviet military communications.   For 42 years, the U.S. and key Western allies, nownumbering 16, have sent high-level officials to periodic,closed-door meetings in Paris of the Coordinating Committeefor Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom. Last year, afterthe opening of the Berlin Wall, the Cocom delegates beganrewriting their trade guidelines. But recently, the Sovietcrackdown in the Baltic Republics and allied disputes oversuch issues as fiber-optics have slowed the momentum toliberalize trade further.</TEXT></DOC>
