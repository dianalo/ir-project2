But theproud hospital finally faced one ailing patient it couldn't heal:itself.   This was not the fictional St. Eligius closing down in the finalseason of television's ``St. Elsewhere,'' but St. Anne's Hospital, areal-life anchor in a struggling neighborhood, shutting its doorsafter 85 years.   Too little income and too much debt proved to be the formula forfailure _ one being repeated increasingly in hospitals nationwide.   ``Most of the people feel they've been deserted, walked out on,''said Mary Volpe, a local resident.   ``It dampens the spirit of the community,'' said Alderman DannyDavis. ``It diminishes the quality of life in our community. Itdiminishes the level of hope.''   Across America, big cities and small towns alike are losingprecious hospitals. Health care is changing: demand for beds isdown, costs are up. With fewer paying patients and more reliance ongovernment programs that critics say are too stingy, the nation'shospital system has reached a breaking point.   ``We're in a health-care crisis,'' said Earl Bird, president ofthe Metropolitan Chicago Healthcare Council, an association of localhospitals. ``We're not heading for anything, we're in the throes ofit.''   Twice in two years, record numbers of hospitals have closed: 79in 1987 _ 17 of them in Texas alone _ and 71 in 1986, the AmericanHospital Association says. In the first 10 months of this year,preliminary reports show 75 more hospitals shut their doors.   The causes cross demographic boundaries: The closings are evenlydivided between rural and urban hospitals.   While about 30 percent of all hospitals are losing money, twicethat percentage can show their unstaunched flow of red ink comesspecifically from rising costs of patient treatment, said CarolMcCarthy, hospital association president.   ``That,'' she said, ``is a fragile hospital system.''   Many cities have experienced the decline. According to healthofficials:   _ New York City saw 34 of its 104 hospitals close in 1976-86.Unlike cities with too many vacant beds, New York has 90 percentoccupancy rates, said Ken Raske, president of the Greater New YorkHospital Association. AIDS and drug problems, he said, haveprolonged hospital stays.   _ From 1983 to the present, 22 of Los Angeles County's 182community hospitals have closed or converted to other kinds of care.   _ Chicago has seen 10 hospitals fold since 1984. Seven are inareas designated as medically underserved, meaning they have highinfant mortality rates, large elderly populations and too fewdoctors. Last year, two-thirds of all Chicago hospitals lost money.   Cities, McCarthy said, are seeing a ``domino effect'' _ ahospital serving the poor closes, so people move to another onenearby, which develops the same problems and often suffers the samefate.   ``Eventually, you're going to wind up with a medical wasteland,''said Kenneth Robbins, president of the Illinois Hospital Association.   The reasons for this collapse aren't all negative: Americans areliving longer, and improved medicine makes most hospital staysshorter or even unnecessary. A patient once hospitalized 12 days formajor abdominal surgery, for example, could now be out in three.   But there's plenty of finger-pointing over dollars and cents.   Hospital officials claim the government has shirkedresponsibility by underfunding Medicaid, which serves the poor, andMedicare, which serves the elderly.   They say Medicare problems intensified in 1983 after a new systembegan paying hospitals flat fees according to diagnosis. Somehospitals are also worried by a rule that took effect Nov. 1,reducing the amount Medicare pays for patients who are hospitalizedfor long periods.   In Illinois, Medicare pays only 89 cents for each dollar of care,while Medicaid pays just 67 cents, Robbins said. State officialsinsist their Medicaid share is higher, but won't say how much.   ``For every Medicaid patient a hospital sees, it simply losesmore money than if it didn't see the patient at all,'' Robbins said.   Medicaid also can hinder doctor recruitment, Robbins said,because reimbursement is so low. A doctor in a poor neighborhoodwould have to see three times as many patients as one in acomfortable suburb to earn the same salary.   ``This actually encourages Medicaid mills'' _ doctors writingbogus bills or packing in large numbers of patients for financialgain, he said.   Adding to this squeeze is charity. Some 37 million Americans haveno insurance; in Chicago, it's 20 percent of the population.Illinois hospitals gave $600 million in free care last year.   But state officials say the fault lies not with the governmentbut with the hospitals, which operate inefficiently and haven't keptpace with a changing society.   ``Hospitals like St. Anne's are the steel mills of the hospitalindustry,'' said Edward Duffy, former director of the stateDepartment of Public Aid. ``People don't use hospitals like theyused to.''   Some say both arguments are valid.   ``It's one of those tragic situations where everybody is rightand everybody is wrong,'' said Dr. Quentin Young, professor ofpreventive medicine at the University of Illinois.   ``We have created a two-tiered system,'' he said, ``people withresources who get the benefits and weaknesses of the system, and 20percent and growing who are locked out. That is the tragic dilemmaof American health care.''   It's hit hard in Austin, Chicago's largest neighborhood with140,000 residents. The closing of the block-long, 437-bed hospitaltwo months ago was one more setback in this predominantly blacksection that has grappled with crime, white flight, panic peddlersand slum landlords. Now it's lost a major employer _ the hospitalstaff once numbered 650.   Some people also worry the loss will hurt those who need medicalhelp the most but postpone seeking it until the last minute.   ``Poor people do not take time out for preventive healthservices,'' said Jacquelin Reed, chairwoman of the West Side HealthCoalition. ``If you don't have any medical insurance, you wait untilyou have to go to the emergency room.''   The remaining neighborhood hospital, 2{ miles away, provides noobstetric care, and Austin has higher than average rates of sexuallytransmitted diseases and an infant mortality rate twice the nationalaverage.   What doomed St. Anne's is what has destroyed others.   When it closed, about 70 percent of its patients were Medicaidrecipients; 20 percent more were Medicare.   Losses were running about $500,000 a month. Had St. Anne'sremained open, they probably would have reached $12 million thisyear, said Kate Stuckmann, chief operating officer.   Cutbacks in staff and beds _ the hospital had 120 open when itclosed _ weren't enough. And as doctors left the city, they referredpatients to suburban hospitals.   It was a sad end to a hospital that served valiantly in times oftragedy, including a 1958 fire that killed 92 children and threenuns at Our Lady of Angels school.   Even now, two months after the closing, ``this community is in astate of shock,'' said Cynthia Williams, director of the AustinPeoples Action Center. ``We basically don't know what to do if anaccident occurs. Austin is in crisis.''</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Sharon Cohen is the AP Midwest regional reporter,based in Chicago.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon PMs, Nov. 28</NOTE></DOC>
