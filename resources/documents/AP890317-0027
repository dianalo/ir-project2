This cannot continue,'' Peggy Say saidThursday at a ceremony in Washington, D.C., attended by members ofCongress, Anderson's colleagues and relatives of the hostages inBeirut, Lebanon.   The ceremony marked the four years Anderson, the chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press, has been held captiveand was one of many observances across the country. The anniversaryalso included a congressional resolution calling for release of allthe hostages and a statement from President Bush expressing hissympathy.   Anderson, 41, the longest held of the American hostages, waskidnapped March 16, 1985, in Beirut by a group believed to be madeup of Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to Iran.   In Washington, the Senate, on a voice vote, said it ``condemnsall forms of hostage taking for whatever purposes by individuals,groups or governments.''   The Bush administration called Anderson's detention a ``criminalact which serves no cause.''   ``The president certainly is concerned about the hostages,'' saidMarlin Fitzwater, Bush's spokesman, who was in Houston with thepresident.   The administration pledged to continue working for the release ofAnderson, but officials repeated their policy of not cutting dealswith the group believed to be holding the hostages.   ``Marking these anniversaries is difficult for the families,''but they serve to remind all Americans that their countrymen areheld in Lebanon, Fitzwater said.   In Lorain, Ohio, Anderson's boyhood home, about 500 people woreyellow ribbons, heard music written in Anderson's honor and sentaloft hundreds of balloons to symbolize their hope that Andersonwill be freed soon.   About 200 children from Irving Middle School released theballoons as Jack LaVriha, chairman of the Free Terry AndersonCommittee, played a tape recording of ``We Want You Home Again.''   The song, by Lorain native Richard Bacher, was written atChristmas in Anderson's honor. Its lyrics, sung in the recording bythe Lorain High School choir, implores Anderson's captors to``listen to our plea and send him home.''   In Cadiz, Ky., an estimated 75 people attended a service at Mrs.Say's church. She moved there from Batavia, N.Y., where her brotheralso grew up.   ``As long as one citizen is held hostage, our nation is heldhostage,'' said the Rev. Harold Skaggs, paster of Cadiz BaptistChurch. ``All freedom is diminished when one is held hostage.''   Skaggs asked participants to keep wearing the yellow ribbons theywere given and to burn candles in their windows at home to expresshope that the hostages would be freed.   In Belleview, Fla., Anderson's brother, John Anderson, organizeda candlelight vigil. ``We want to raise public awareness so thatpeople know they can use their voice and let government know whatthey want,'' Anderson said.   Anderson's cousin, Rusty Ruth, organized a vigil in San Jose,Calif., that about 100 people attended.   ``I cry a lot,'' she said. ``I don't cry publicly, but I do cry alot. I wonder why we have such a hard time communicating with ourgovernment.''   At the Washington ceremony, fellow journalists joined in thedemand for Anderson's release.   ``Our hearts cry out in protest'' over Anderson's plight, saidLouis D. Boccardi, president of the AP.   ``It's time for those holding Terry Anderson to release him andto end the unconscionable suffering of an innocent man. Each of usin our own special way should mark this day with contemplation andprayer for Terry's release,'' Boccardi said in a statement sent tothe AP's staff.   The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based group,called on Bush to use ``every means at his disposal to bring TerryAnderson home.''   Colleagues who knew and worked with Anderson talked of hisdedication to his job, his desire to tell the story of the war-tornnation and his willingness to take risks.   ``He has paid an awful price these last four years,'' said DavidIgnatius, an associate editor of The Washington Post.   The Rev. Lawrence Martin Jenco, a former hostage held for a timewith Anderson, said that before his own release on July 26, 1986, hepromised the journalist ``that I would never forget him, that otherswould never forget him.''</TEXT></DOC>
