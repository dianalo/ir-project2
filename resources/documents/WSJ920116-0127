The country that nowentertains American presidents looking for a break is thesame country whose governments are routinely wrecked bybribes, kickbacks and even geishas. The paradox of a greateconomic power run by an increasingly debilitated politicalclass is something Americans curious about Japan's behaviorshould want to know more about. Indeed, for many Americans,Japan's political problems may sound familiar.   The current troubles of Japanese Prime Minister KiichiMiyazawa erupted Monday with the arrest on bribery charges ofone of the prime minister's longtime political aides, FumioAbe. Mr. Abe has been accused of accepting some $633,000 inbribes from a now-bankrupt steel company, Kyowa. Theprosecutor's office is alleging that Mr. Abe used his cloutto help Kyowa get construction contracts and cheap governmentloans. Mr. Abe denies the allegations.</LP><TEXT>   What threatens Prime Minister Miyazawa is that both he andMr. Abe belong to the same faction in the Liberal DemocraticParty that has dominated Japanese politics since the 1950s.The question rattling Japan's political establishment iswhether any of Mr. Abe's alleged bribe income went into thecampaign funds of the LDP faction that last Novemberpropelled Mr. Miyazawa into office.   All this might be less threatening to Mr. Miyazawa had theLDP generally enjoyed a cleaner record these past few years.But recall that back in 1988 Mr. Miyazawa was forced toresign from his previous post of finance minister overconnections between one of his aides and the Recruit Cosmosstock scandal. The Recruit scandal rolled on to topple PrimeMinister Noboru Takeshita in 1989. That same year, a geishascandal felled Mr. Takeshita's successor, Prime MinisterSousuke Uno. The next prime minister, Toshiki Kaifu, heldonto his job for two years. During Mr. Kaifu's tenure,however, the spotlight turned to the financial sector, wherea series of scandals in 1991 brought such sights as thepresident of Japan's biggest brokerage house, Nomura,apologizing and resigning.   When this tide of scandal first began to flow some fouryears ago, the question was why the Japanese people seemedoffended by what had long been taken as standard operatingprocedure in Japanese politics and finance. Our sense of itwas that the increasingly sophisticated Japanese electoratewas showing its irritation with an unresponsive ruling LDPthat catered first to the demands of the state bureaucracyand last to the voters.   The biggest straw in the wind was the public outrage overan unwanted 3% sales tax, demanded by the Ministry of Financeand approved in late 1988 by the LDP. It was about the sametime that the Recruit scandal went ballistic. In electionsthe following August 1989, the LDP for the first time indecades lost its majority in the upper house of the Diet, asignificant event even though the upper house is relativelyweak.   The LDP might have recognized then that Japan had evolvedradically since the 1950s. It's no longer a farm-baseddeveloping nation with an electorate intent mainly onrecovering from World War II and willing to tolerate a vastweb of regulation and so-called administrative guidance.Japan today is an economic superpower, whose voters are moreinclined to demand respect from their elected leaders, aswell as the higher living standards appropriate to their highincomes. But they've got a problem: The Japanese peopleremain saddled with politicians and bureaucrats who stillworship rice fields and who try to fine tune a $3 trillioneconomy.   While fine tuning to channel all that wealth, politiciansand bureaucrats come to wield a lot of clout. It'spredictable that people in such positions are tempted to takebribes. It's also natural that public disgust over this kindof corruption should continue to grow as the rustyregulations remain in place and the scandals multiply.   Japan deserves world respect for producing such marvels assome of the world's most sought-after cars. But it's time forJapan's politicians to get serious about deregulating theJapanese economy. At the moment, there's not much evidencethat the politicians and public-sector bureaucrats areinclined to get their clumsy hands off the marketplace -- inJapan, or here in the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
