The finding isn't surprising, but it adds a new dimensionto the controversy over the role of money in medicine. Whilemany businesses use bonuses to increase sales, some healthcare experts worry that such incentives can cloud a doctor'sjudgment in prescribing care for patients.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's one piece of information about financial incentivesand physician behavior,&quot; says David Hemenway of the HarvardSchool of Public Health and lead author of the study. &quot;Itsays that money matters. It doesn't say money is the onlything that matters or even the most important thing.&quot;   The report is based on the experience of 15 doctors atdifferent clinics owned by Health Stop Medical ManagementInc., a chain of walk-in primary care centers based in NewtonCentre, Mass., that voluntarily participated in the study.It's especially interesting because it compares the practicepatterns of the same doctors before and after Health Stopinstituted a bonus program in mid-1985. While dozens ofstudies have examined the impact of incentives on doctors --with mixed conclusions -- very few have compared the samedoctors, working at the same facilities.   Prior to the bonus program, Health Stop doctors were paidat a flat rate of $28 an hour. Under the bonus program, theywere paid from $28 to $32 an hour or a percentage of thegross monthly charges they generated, whichever was higher.Doctors were ranked monthly based on the average charge perpatient visit and the number of diagnostic tests performed.The reports circulated among the doctors and managersquestioned those whose results were considered outside normalranges.   Researchers found that doctors ordered 23% more lab testsper patient visit and 16% more X-rays during a three-monthperiod after the incentive program was established, comparedwith the like period a year earlier, when the flat-ratesalary was in effect. Patient visits increased 12%. Theaverage charge per visit, in constant 1984 dollars, rose 7%,while total monthly charges soared 20%.   Among the 15 doctors, six generated enough revenue to geta bonus every month, earning an average of $5,045 a month,while seven never received a bonus, earning an average of$4,291. The doctors paid a bonus saw an average of 378patients a month, while those who didn't saw an average of276 patients. The variation in patient visits wasn'texplained.   Doctors generated similar increases in charges per month,regardless of their bonus status, indicating that anincentive program can induce a group of doctors to prescribemore services, even if only some of them benefit, theresearchers said.   Despite the increased revenues, researchers said theyfound &quot;little evidence of gross overtreatment.&quot; The report isfrom a larger study of Health Stop's operations conducted inthe mid-1980s.   Mark Shankman, the concern's president and chief executiveofficer, said the authors drew conclusions that &quot;aren't fullysupported by their data,&quot; and suggested that one reason forincreased revenues is that patients are gaining confidence insuch clinics and coming in with more serious problems. Healso said the observed price increase was similar to nationalincreases. &quot;While this type of study plays a role in healthcare research,&quot; Dr. Shankman said, &quot;we recommend caution ininterpreting this data, drawing conclusions about our medicalpractices and making policy decisions.&quot;   The study appears in today's issue of the New EnglandJournal of Medicine, which published an article 18 months agoon the personal experience of a doctor who was fired from awalk-in clinic because he failed to generate enough revenueper patient. Arnold Relman, the journal's editor, is aleading critic of for-profit medicine and its potential forprompting practitioners to run up medical bills needlessly orto withhold necessary care.</TEXT></DOC>
