In a statement issued at the close of a one-week conferencereviewing the ABM treaty, the U.S. delegation said ``the SovietUnion gave no indication that it was prepared to correct'' itsviolations of the treaty ``without linking their agreement to do soto unacceptable demands.''   The statement also made plain that the U.S. side now linksdismantling of the Krasnoyarsk radar to agreement in other armscontrol negotiations in Geneva.   ``The United States has also made clear that the continuingexistence of the Krasnoyarsk radar makes it impossible to concludeany future arms agreements'' in separate negotiations on reducingintercontinental nuclear forces, known as the START talks, and onspace and defense systems, it said.   The Soviet Union did not immediately issue its own statement,and the Soviet diplomatic mission said a spokesman was notimmediately available.   The U.S. statement referred to the radar under construction atKrasnoyarsk, in Siberia, which the United States has longmaintained constitutes a violation of the ABM treaty because it isnot situated at the edge of the country, pointed outward, as thetreaty stipulates such a radar must be.   The statement said the United States has observed a slowdown inconstruction of the radar, but insists the radar must be dismantled.   The statement said that the violation ``is very serious,especially when it is recognized that the radar constitutes one ofa network of such radars'' that have the potential to supportballistic missile defenses.   The U.S. side also raised the issue of Soviet deployment lastyear of two other radars in Gomel, near Kiev, the statement said.   The ABM treaty limits each side to deploying one ABM systemcomprising a radar and anti-ballistic missiles and constrainsradars for early warning which could, because of their location,orientation and capability, contribute to an ABM defense.   The aim is to prevent either side from creating a full,country-wide protective network, under the theory that neither sidewould launch a nuclear attack if it feared devastating retaliation.   The Soviet Union has an ABM system deployed around Moscow. TheUnited States has not deployed one.   The U.S. statement called the radar a material breach of thetreaty and said the United States ``reserves all its rights,consistent with international law, to take appropriate andproportionate responses in the future.''   The statement did not elaborate on what those responses mightbe. But an information sheet distributed last week by the U.S.mission says that according to the Vienna Convention on the Law ofTreaties, if one party charges ``material breach,'' it is entitledto invoke the breach ``as a ground for terminating the treaty orsuspending its operation in whole or in part.''   Such action would apparently free the United States to conductuninhibited research and deployment of its Strategic DefenseInitiative, currently in the research stage, which aims at creatinga space-based missile defense.   The Soviet Union has charged that some SDI research violates theABM treaty, but in its public statements has not specified where itdraws the line.   Both sides link compliance with the ABM treaty to progress atother arms control negotiations under way in Geneva.   The Soviet Union has long made agreement on limiting SDIresearch a precondition for a START agreement. The United Stateshas rejected such a linkage.   The START talks have been going on in Geneva since March 1985.The two sides have agreed in principle on reducing their forces by50 percent, but many issues remain to be resolved.</TEXT></DOC>
