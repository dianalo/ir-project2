It was the biggest joint venture ever announced between aforeign supplier and a domestic oil company in the ``downstream''end of the business, the process for changing crude into gasolineand other products.   Such a venture would help provide an assured market for SaudiArabia, the world's biggest exporter of oil. But some analysts saidit raised serious questions about the consequences of increasedforeign leverage over the U.S. oil industry, which has become morereliant on imports in the past few years.   ``We've been predicting for months that this joint venturing ofrefining and marketing assets would accelerate,'' said George J.Gaspar, oil analyst at the Milwaukee investment firm Robert W.Baird andamp; Co. ``It could potentially put the smaller refining andmarketing operators at a disadvantage.''   The announcement also came as Texaco management took a battleagainst takeover strategist Carl C. Icahn to its annual shareholdermeeting Friday, which could determine the destiny of the nation'sthird-largest oil company.   The timing of the announcement reflected the intense pressuremanagement faced to foil Icahn by convincing shareholders it wastaking aggressive steps to restructure Texaco and raise the valueof their investment.   ``Texaco is locked in the struggle with Icahn, and it is comingdown to the wire,'' said Stephen Smith, an analyst at Bear StearnsCos. in New York. ``Clearly Texaco managers need to tell theirstory: We are a new company, we've put the past behind us. We'reaggressively going to downsize.''   Texaco management has said it plans to sell about $5 billion inproperty to offset the disastrous effects of prolonged litigationwith Pennzoil Co., which resulted in bankpruptcy protection and a$3 billion payment to that company. Icahn, Texaco's largestshareholder, has denounced management performance and has offeredto buy Texaco for $60 a share. But doubts about who will prevailhelped depress the stock by 62{ cents a share Thursday to $49.25.   Under a letter of intent between Texaco and Saudi Arabia, SaudiRefining Inc. will have a half interest in Texaco's refining assetsand marketing system in 23 eastern and Gulf Coast states as well asWashington, a company statement said.   The joint venture's assets will include three major Texacorefineries, in Delaware City, Del.; Convent, La.; and Port Arthur,Texas; 49 terminals, about 1,450 owned and leased service stationsand a distributor network of more than 10,000 stations.   The statement said Saudi interest in these assets was valued at$800 million and the Saudi side would provide 30 million barrels ofthe venture's initial inventory of 40 million barrels.   It said Texaco expected to ``achieve approximately $2 billion incash benefits and savings from the formation of the joint venturebased on current oil prices.''   The statement did not explain how the $2 billion figure wasderived, nor did it say whether either side could withdraw if therewere a major change in Texaco such as an Icahn-led takeover. Texacoofficials at the company's White Plains, N.Y, headquarters declinedto offer further explanation.   Other U.S. oil companies have engaged foreign partners forrefining and marketing petroleum in this country. Venezuela'sstate-owned oil company, for example, has an interest in CitgoPetroleum Corp., which operates one of the largest U.S. refineries.But the Texaco-Saudi deal would be the largest.   Some analysts said such significant foreign influence in thedomestic oil industry was bound to upset Congressional lawmakersand federal energy officials who already are concerned aboutAmerica's appetite for foreign oil.   ``I think there are a couple of people in Washington who aren'tin favor of it,'' said Carol Epstein, managing editor at PetroleumAnalysis Ltd., a New York consulting and publishing concern.``People still remember the long gasoline lines of the 1970s, andit's not their most pleasant recollection.''</TEXT></DOC>
