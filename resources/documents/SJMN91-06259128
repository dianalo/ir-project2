Israel's Foreign Minister David Levy pledged toSecretary of State James Baker that no immigrants would be directed to settlein the territories and that no special incentives would be offered toencourage the newcomers to choose the areas on their own (to date, less that 1percent of the new immigrants have chosen to reside in the territories, andthey have done so at their own volition, not at government instruction).  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  MAKING ISRAEL WAIT IGNORES URGENT NEED  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Letters to the Editor  </MEMO><TEXT>     Would the Mercury News have suggested that, after the Armenian earthquake,humanitarian aid to Soviet Armenians wait until the fall of communism? Ofcourse not! We recognize that while we may disagree with aspects of anothercountry's internal political situation, that it is important to aid those inneed, nonetheless.;   It is ironic that the world cries out for humanitarianaid to Ethiopians -- unless the Ethiopians have fled to Israel. Then, wedemand that aid be withheld from those in need until Israel makes peace withthe 21 Arab countries that declared war against this little country, the sizeof Kuwait.;   -- Stacey Hyman; San Jose; WHY JUDGE THOMAS SHOULD BE CONFIRMED;The confirmation of Judge Clarence Thomas for Supreme Court justice isdesirable for two reasons. The first, parochially speaking, is that it'salways good to have a conservative-minded person on the Supreme Court. This isnot as ominous as it sounds, however.;   Judge Thomas' background, history ofswitching political parties, and his divergent opinions all indicate theunpredictability of his vote on specific issues.;   The second reason is themore important. As a 43-year-old Supreme Court justice in almost daily publiclimelight, he will serve as a role model for black children for the next 30-40years. Children of all races have many role models to choose from. This onebrings dimensions worthy of adopting.;   -- John J. Flaherty; Atherton; BUSHIS FORGETTING ABOUT LUNG CANCER; Bush's recent remarks on AIDS seriously callinto question whether he's fit to be the president of the United States.;   Isthis man uninformed, ill-informed or just plain stupid? His statement thatAIDS &quot;can be stopped by behavioral changes, unlike cancer&quot; sets the mindreeling. Could it be that the 80 percent of lung cancer caused by smoking justslipped his mind -- or did he just slip up and show the world that he reallyis nothing but a homophobic bigot after all?;   -- Kenneth R.
