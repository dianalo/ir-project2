An axisymmetricforce free field configuration of the pinch parameter {theta} of 1.3to 1.4 is successfully established from spontaneous generation of toroidalfield flux and is sustained for nearly 100 {mu}s. During the settingup phase, local toroidal fields accompanied with m = 1 perturbationsare produced, and develop to local toroidal field flux and global toroidalfield flux. Axial asymmetry results in toroidal rotation of the plasmaand the configuration is axially symmetrized. During the sustainmentphase ({theta} = constant), field flux discretely increased togetherwith the plasma current. Termination of the configuration results fromdecay of loop voltage and is accompanied with appearance of axial asymmetryon field flux.</TEXT></DOC>
