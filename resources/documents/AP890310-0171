(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Rev. Jerry Falwell told the 2,000employees of his religious empire Friday that they are expected tojoin his church and donate 10 percent of their salaries to it.   ``If this is something you in your heart can't do, it would bebetter for you to not be a member of this team, rather than beforced to serve God here,'' Falwell told employees of LibertyUniversity, Old-Time Gospel Hour, Lynchburg Christian Academy,Liberty Godparent Home, Liberty Broadcasting Network and Thomas RoadBaptist Church.   About 400 of the workers are employed by Liberty University andLiberty Christian Academy, where they sign contracts calling forchurch membership and tithing, Falwell spokesman Mark DeMoss said.Other workers have for years been expected to comply by the rules ofa policy book that also calls for church attendance and tithing, hesaid.   Falwell asked employees who do not comply by the rules to quit byJuly 1, but DeMoss said the ministry will trust workers to comply ontheir own.   ``We're not talking about Gestapo methods,'' said Falwell. ``Butwe cannot move ahead without getting our camps together. ... I feltthe need to once again verbalize the vision.''   Some workers will be exempted from the requirements, DeMoss said.Exempted workers would include, for example, teachers who arepastors of their own churches or long-time Lynchburg residents whohave been members of other churches, the spokesman said.   Workers leaving the 45-minute meeting at Thomas Road BaptistChurch were divided in their opinions on Falwell's stand.   Old-Time Gospel Hour employee Dana Williams told WSET-TV shewould quit. ``This is morally and spiritually wrong. I'm just asgood of a Christian as anyone here, and I tithe to my regularchurch.''   Thomas Road Baptist Church employee Glenn Reese countered, ``Ithink Jerry Falwell was only re-emphasizing his vision and thevision of the Bible in bringing church workers together.''   The ministry's payroll is $35 million, and if each worker paid 10percent, that would equal the Thomas Road church's annual budget of$3.5 million, Falwell said.   DeMoss said there was no significance to the timing of Falwell'smeeting, which came shortly Falwell firmed up plans for a $30million, 10,000-seat church to be built near the Liberty Universitycampus by 1991.   ``When our fiscal year ends on June 30, the total revenue willexceed last year's receipts by nearly $40 million, for a total ofabout $129 million, compared with under $88 million a year ago,''DeMoss said.   Falwell's meeting with the local employees also was part of hislong-term plan to get out of the national spotlight and concentratemore on his local ministry, DeMoss said. After Falwell assumedcontrol of PTL and then left it a short time later in 1987, he saidhe would try to spend more time working as a local preacher.</TEXT></DOC>
