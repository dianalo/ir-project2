A front page story in The Wall Street Journal gave detailsof how Nuclear Metals Inc., a small depleted-uraniumprocessor in Concord, Mass., had quietly lobbied the EnergyDepartment, the Army and Congress to add the stockpileprovision. Depleted uranium is the material cast off whenuranium is enriched to make nuclear fuel. After beingprocessed into a metal, depleted uranium is used as the coreof tank-killing ammunition and as tank armor.</LP><TEXT>   Wilson Tuffin, president of Nuclear Metals, said thematerial should still be stockpiled, so the U.S. &quot;couldrespond quickly in an emergency.&quot; But a declassified summaryof the Pentagon report said stockpiling wasn't necessary. TheU.S. already had adequate supplies of depleted-uraniumammunition, the report said, and a 300-year hoard ofdepleted-uranium feedstock that could be processed intometal.   The stockpile program would provide &quot;a one-shot stimulusto the {depleted-uranium} industry,&quot; the report said. But theprogram would also &quot;saddle&quot; the stockpile with a material&quot;that is not scarce, has no significant applications outsidethe military and is considered to be an environmental andhealth hazard.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
