For one out ofthree, the change was big enough to move them to a differentincome quintile.   In a new study, the Census Bureau divided the U.S. intofive equal-sized family income groups, with each quintilecomprising roughly 45 million Americans (the number growseach year with the population). At the end of 1986,two-thirds were in the same relative position that they hadbeen in at the beginning of 1985.   Of the one-third that changed quintiles, 18% moved to alower quintile, and 16% moved up to a higher one. (The upwardand downward moves don't necessarily balance because ofpopulation additions and subtractions during the studyperiod.)   Young people were most likely to move to a differentincome quintile. Nineteen percent of 18- to 24-year-oldsmoved up, and 20% moved down. Elderly people had the moststable incomes. Only 8% of those age 65 or older moved to ahigher income quintile, and 16% moved down.   Being at the top -- or bottom -- doesn't mean stayingthere. One out of four people who were in the top incomequintile in 1985 had fallen to a lower quintile in 1986.Likewise, 18% of those who started at the bottom moved up.                                                                                                          Roles in the Home   Can Vary Over Time                                                                                                          AGE AND SEX have a lot to do with people's family roles.   Young adults have the greatest variety of household roles.Thirty-nine percent of young men age 18 to 34 head their ownfamilies, while 3% are married to family heads. Thedesignation &quot;head of household&quot; was self-defined by thepeople surveyed in a Census Bureau study.   For young women, the situation is reversed. Fourteenpercent head families, while 44% are spouses of heads.Thirty-one percent of young men live with their parents, 5%live with other relatives, and 23% don't live in families atall (most of them live alone). Since so many young women arespouses, only 23% live with mom and dad, and 3% with otherrelatives; 15% don't live in a family.   By middle age, 73% of men are family heads. Five percentof men ages 35 to 54 are spouses of heads, and 6% live withparents or other relatives. The share living alone or withnonrelatives is down to 16%. Two-thirds of middle-aged womenare spouses, and 19% head families. Four percent live in someother relative's household, and 11% live outside of a familygroup.   Men's head-of-household status peaks in the mature years.Fully 76% of men age 55 or older head families. Four percentare spouses of heads, 4% live with other relatives, and 16%don't live in families. For older women, widowhood vies withspousehood. Nearly half of older women are still spouses, but34% are no longer in families (many are widows living alone).Twelve percent of women age 55 or older head families, and 5%live with other relatives.                                                                                                          Romance in America,   And How It Pans Out                                                                                                          ONE DIVORCE occurs for every two marriages in the U.S.,but this doesn't mean that half of people are divorced.   A Census Bureau report shows that 8% of Americans age 15or older are currently divorced. Seven percent are widowed,26% haven't been married and 59% are married (including 2%who are separated and 1% who have a spouse absent for otherreasons, such as military duty).   It takes two to marry, but men are more likely than womento be married, 58% vs. 53%. This is because there are morewomen than men in the population, especially at the top endof the age spectrum. Twelve percent of women are widows,while only 3% of men are widowers.   Since the male population is slightly younger than thefemale population, men are more likely than women to besingle. Thirty percent of men have never married, comparedwith 23% of women. The difference in age may also explain why9% of women are divorced, compared with less than 7% of men.Also, because the married category includes remarriages, andbecause men are more likely to get remarried, that leavesfewer of them in the divorce pool.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          ONLY ONE out of five Americans trust the way insurancecompanies collect and use personal information aboutcustomers. A Louis Harris study on consumer attitudesregarding privacy issues, sponsored by Equifax Inc. ofAtlanta, found that hospitals are most trusted to usepersonal data responsibly, followed by the Census Bureau andthe Social Security Administration. Consumers are mostdistrustful of direct-marketing companies; only 6% think thatsuch businesses collect and use information about people in aresponsible way. . . . College students are busy people.According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 87% of the 1.3million part-time college students enrolled in the fall of1989 were working, and another 4% were looking for work.Among the nearly seven million full-time college students,46% had jobs and 7% were looking for them. . . . Mexican foodhas gone mainstream, with 41% of homemakers buying thefixings for it in food stores. According to MediamarkResearch of New York, college-educated women, people underage 45 and working parents are most likely to buy tacoshells, nachos and other Mexican foods. Mediamark also findsthat light beer drinkers are better-educated and moreaffluent than the average regular beer drinker.</TEXT></DOC>
