They could have called this disc &quot;Shower StallConcerts of the Rich and Famous.&quot; The blackmail potential of thesecompromising cuts is staggering. If you were Mel Torme, how much would you payto block the re-release of &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot;?;    The first white-rapstrains of Sam Ervin's &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; will probably have thelate North Carolina senator convulsing in his grave. And poor Bing Crosby! DerBingle's take on &quot;Hey Jude&quot; should have been buried under 6 feet of reinforcedconcrete.;    Apparently every celeb has a few musical skeletons in thecloset. And most can't resist the temptation to flirt with rock 'n' rolldisaster. These sad testaments to vocal frailty really give one pause towonder just what planet these folks were on when they shredded these popclassics. Somebody should have dragged Sebastian Cabot away from the mike whenhe tried to &quot;recite&quot; Dylan's &quot;All I Really Want To Do.&quot; And someone shouldhave beamed notorious &quot;Golden Throats&quot; vets Leonard Nimoy and William Shatnerback up to the Starship Enterprise before they sang again!;    But no, they'reall here. Let us now praise famous men -- and women such as Phyllis &quot;Can't GetNo Satisfaction&quot; Diller and Mae &quot;Light My Fire&quot; West -- for this glowingmonument to banality. Sammy Davis Jr.'s bizarre hepcat rendition of &quot;In theGhetto&quot; and Mitch Miller's odious take on &quot;Give Peace a Chance&quot; are more thanenough to justify this purchase, dig?;    -- David Plotnikoff;  YES;&quot;Yesyears&quot;; (Atco PRCD 4019 2, CD and cassette); (star)(star)(star); AlthoughYes wasn't, arguably, the most creative of the Art Rock set -- stronger casescould be made for Soft Machine, Brian Eno and others -- the group wasunquestionably the most successful and popular.;    And &quot;Yesyears,&quot; a four-CD(or four-cassette) set, proves why.;    The set, which comes with the usualassortment of hits, rarities and heretofore unreleased songs spanning thegroup's 22-year career, is a study in the ways in which seemingly adventurousmusic could be made palatable for the pop multitudes.;    &quot;Roundabout,&quot; &quot;YoursIs No Disgrace&quot; and just about all the rest come with classical flourishes anddazzling instrumental displays that are tempered with the shimmering,wood-nymph melodies and vocals of Jon Anderson. Even the more angular andabstract moments -- like the opening of &quot;Close to the Edge&quot; -- give way to popthemes that are accessible to just about any pop fan.;    That is the secretof the group's success: Expand the boundaries of pop while never abandoningthe time-tested verities of the genre.;    Over the course of the set's 46songs, the various lineups of the group are to be had in all their finery andexcess. &quot;Then&quot; is a previously unreleased song recorded by the BBC in 1970with the original lineup while 1974's &quot;Ritual -- Nous Sommes Du Soleil&quot; is apiece from the extravagant Rick Wakeman era. And songs like &quot;Owner of a LonelyHeart&quot; from a new Yes version of 1983 prove how the group has adapted andreinvented itself over the decades.;    There are a few miscues -- such asembarrassing renditions of the Beatles' &quot;I'm Down&quot; and &quot;Every Little Thing.&quot;And a few nice surprises -- such as &quot;Vevey, Part One,&quot; recorded with Andersonon harp and the stunning Wakeman on organ at a church in Vevey, Switzerland(also unreleased to this point).;    &quot;Yesyears&quot; is a sturdy compendium of thegroup's career and a reminder of the excesses and the successes that have beenpart and parcel of the years of Yes.;    -- Harry Sumrall;  ROBYN HITCHCOCK;AND THE EGYPTIANS; &quot;Perspex Island&quot;; (Aandamp;M, cassette and CD); (star)(star); This disc is entrancing, sporadically brilliant and much more down-to-earththan most of Hitchcock's previous missives. The perennial college-radiodarling has knocked out 10 uneven, enigmatic albums with the Egyptians andSoft Boys over the past 13 years, and this is the first that just might makeit with a broader audience.;    Perhaps he's not the raving loony he seemed tobe when &quot;Globe of Frogs&quot; came out in '88 but just a terribly misunderstoodwriter of pure pop. The new-and-improved Hitchcock, whose songwriting hastaken a romantic turn as of late, would be right at home between Dave Edmundsand Morrissey on the Brit-pop spectrum.;    R.E.M.'s Pete Buck plays guitar oneight of the 11 tracks and Michael Stipe pulls guest-vocal duties on one. TheBeatles-esque &quot;So You Think You're In Love&quot; and the dance-floor powerhousenumbers &quot;Oceanside&quot; and &quot;Child Of The Universe&quot; deserve a listen, the rest ispretty tame fare.;    -- D.P.;  Reissues; ELVIS PRESLEY; &quot;Collectors Gold&quot;;(RCA, CD and cassette); (star)(star);  Geraldo Rivera would be proud. RCA'slatest dredging of the Elvis Presley vaults turned up as much treasure asRivera found searching for Al Capone's riches.;    But they've released itanyway, 48 previously unreleased tracks in a 50-track set (on three CDs in theformat we reviewed).;    The set, comprising tracks from 1960 and later, isdivided into three parts: &quot;Hollywood,&quot; &quot;Nashville&quot; and &quot;Live in Las Vegas,&quot;where the tracks were recorded.;    The Hollywood tracks are all associatedwith Presley movies. The Nashville tracks, the best part of the set, feature amore mature-sounding Presley. The Las Vegas tracks are taken from differentperformances during a 1969 engagement at the International Hotel.;    RCA'sgoal, it would seem, was to find as much new material as possible and offer itup to eager fans. But only Presley completists would be interested in newtakes of these second-rate tunes, most of them less-familiar, including &quot;AWhistling Tune&quot; and &quot;Big Boots,&quot; to name two.;    On the Las Vegas tracks,Presley and his band show a distinct lack of care as they race through hishits while tossing off covers of other writers' songs.;    And nothing in thisset approaches the historical significance of the &quot;My Happiness&quot; acetate or&quot;Million Dollar Quartet&quot; sessions. The most significant find would appear tobe &quot;Black Star,&quot; an early version of &quot;Flaming Star.&quot;;    If RCA's goal is torelease every note Presley ever recorded, it would seem the label is gettingclose.;    -- Steve Marinucci;  Country; JIMMIE DALE GILMORE; &quot;After Awhile&quot;;Elektra Nonesuch; (star)(star)(star) 1/2;  To hear Gilmore sing for the firsttime is unsettling. His twangy but lyrical voice makes you wonder, was HankWilliams' death an elaborate hoax? If that's too much of a stretch, how aboutimagining what Neil Young would sound like, had he been raised in West Texaslistening to Lefty Frizzell and Buddy Holly?;    That ethereal, mesmerizingvoice perhaps has no parallel in country music today. But among songwriters,Gilmore takes his place with such Texas brethren (and sistren) as Townes VanZandt, Rodney Crowell, Lyle Lovett and Nanci Griffith.;    Gilmore dropped outof the music scene almost 20 years ago, after recording with Joe Ely andlifelong friend Butch Hancock as the Flatlanders in 1972. The group eventuallydisbanded, and the album enjoyed only a short lease on the record storeshelves, but became a prized collectors item.;    &quot;After Awhile&quot; is theculmination of 20 years of songwriting for Gilmore. After re-emerging threeyears ago to record a couple of albums, strong on country and other writers'songs, this disc is more representative of his diverse influences -- blues,folk and rock, as well as country.;    &quot;Tonight I Think I'm Gonna Go Downtown&quot;is a beautifully melancholy acoustic number somewhat reminiscent of GramParsons; &quot;Midnight Train&quot; uses harmonica, electric guitar and bass in ablues/rock kicker. There's only one cut on the album that Gilmore can't layclaim to but probably wishes he could, and that's Hancock's &quot;My Mind's Got aMind of Its Own&quot; (&quot;takes me out walkin' when I'd rather stay at home/takes meout to parties when I'd rather be alone&quot;).;    This album, like theFlatlanders, will no doubt become a must among devotees of the &quot;new&quot; Texassound. Let's hope it's enough to keep Gilmore from going back into seclusionfor another two decades.;    -- Deborah Hopewell  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910816  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  August  </MONTH><PG.COL>  23  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,430  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday August 16, 199100229067,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
