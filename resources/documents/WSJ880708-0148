A court-appointed referee recommended that a 425,000-share block of votes cast in the May 6 proxy fight for control of Irving should have been counted in favor of Bank of New York.    If affirmed by Judge Herman Cahn of the State Supreme Court for New York County, the revised vote totals would mean that a special by-law provision allowing holders of 10% of Irving shares to call a special shareholder meeting was adopted. Irving had said that this measure was defeated.    However, the referee's report won't change the outcome of the May 6 election for Irving's board. All 16 incumbent directors, who have steadfastly refused Bank of New York's merger overtures, were re-elected.    A Bank of New York adviser said the bank is likely to seek a special meeting of Irving shareholders to replace the board even though it lost the May 6 vote. However, he said that no final decision had been made. In May, Bank of New York lost the proxy fight by a 52% to 48% margin.    Bank of New York is confident that it will win a vote of holders this time because more Irving shares are now in the hands of arbitragers. Arbitragers are more likely to prefer a quick sale to Bank of New York over an offer from a friendly suitor, Banca Commerciale Italiana S.p.A. Banca Commerciale's $840 million offer is only for 51% of Irving shares and still faces delays in getting approval from regulators.    Irving said it will challenge the referee's report before Judge Cahn and in the appellate courts if necessary.    On Wednesday, Judge Cahn issued a preliminary injunction blocking a provision in Irving's poison pill anti-takeover defense that would have allowed all holders except for Bank of New York to buy Irving shares at a deep discount. The provision would have made it prohibitively expensive for Bank of New York to buy Irving shares.    James J. McDermott, research director for Keefe, Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., said of the latest developments: &quot;It certainly looks like the tide is moving towards Bank of New York . . . The sooner this is put to a vote of shareholders the better.&quot;    Yesterday, Irving asked Judge Cahn to require Bank of New York to post a $256.5 million bond before his injunction is made effective. Irving's attorneys said this sum represents the potential loss to its shareholders if Banca Commerciale isn't able to buy Irving. The court has Irving's request under consideration.    Also, Bank of New York yesterday amended its request to the Federal Reserve Board for additional time to consummate a merger with Irving. Fed approval expires on Saturday. Bank of New York is asking for an additional 60 days or an added 30 days from the date that Irving files its appeal of Judge Cahn's ruling, whichever is sooner.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading yesterday, Irving shares closed at $71.125, up 62.5 cents.    Bank of New York is offering $15 and 1.575 shares of its own stock for each Irving share. The offer is valued at $70.125 a share based on Bank of New York's closing share price of $35 in Big Board trading yesterday, or $1.28 billion. Banca Commerciale, Italy's second largest bank, is offering $80 a share, plus warrants valued at $4 a share, for 51% of Irving. </TEXT></DOC>
