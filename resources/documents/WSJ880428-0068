A Commerce Department report showing continued strength in consumer spending last month surprised some economists but drew little reaction in the credit markets. Several investment managers predict bond trading will remain sluggish until May 6 when the Labor Department releases its monthly employment report.    &quot;The market's been a non-event all week because people are wrestling with the question of whether the Fed will be coming in and tightening&quot; credit another notch, said Wayne F. Wong, a managing director at Marinvest Inc. He contends that government statistics in coming weeks will show further economic strength, persuading Fed officials to push interest rates slightly higher in an effort to control inflation pressures.    &quot;Given all the strength we've seen in the economy, we've been bearish on bonds for quite awhile now,&quot; Mr. Wong continued. &quot;I see no incentive for us to put our money to work in the long end&quot; of the bond market.    Prices of 30-year Treasury bonds traded in a very narrow range all day yesterday, finishing with declines of about one-eighth of a point, or $1.25 for each $1,000 face amount. The yield on the most actively traded issue rose slightly to 9.02% from 9% on both Monday and Tuesday.    The main focus of attention was the government's sale of $8.53 billion of new two-year Treasury notes. The average annual yield was 7.64%, which was in line with what most traders had expected. That was up from 7.39% at the previous sale of two-year notes in March. It also was the highest since 7.93% at an auction late last December.    Federal Reserve officials appear increasingly worried that inflation pressures will mount later this year. Some worry that inflation will accelerate even if the economy continues growing at a moderate pace.    &quot;I think we have to keep a very close watch to make sure inflationary pressures don't become more of a problem,&quot; Robert T. Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, said in an interview yesterday. He warned that even if the economy expands only 2.5% this year, as he expects it will, inflation &quot;still could go up.&quot; In last year's fourth quarter the economy grew at a 4.8% annual rate, after adjustment for inflation.    But many bond traders agree that the Fed doesn't need to tighten credit any further right now. The dollar has been holding steady recently, and Fed watchers say the central bank probably will defer any policy decisions until after the Labor Department's employment report is released a week from tomorrow.    Fed actions in the credit markets recently indicate to many analysts that the central bank is holding policy steady. The Fed yesterday injected funds temporarily into the banking system by arranging six-day repurchase agreements. At the time, the interest rate on federal funds, or overnight loans between banks, was 6 3/4%.    The funds rate yesterday averaged 6.82%, according to an estimate by Fulton Prebon (U.S.A.) Inc. That compared with Tuesday's average of 6.81%, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said.    The Fed appears to be trying to keep the federal funds rate between 6 3/4% and 6 7/8%, analysts say. But if the employment report on May 6 shows continued economic strength, many economists predict the funds rate will rise to 7% or slightly higher.    Bond traders also are apprehensive about a large wave of Treasury borrowing coming soon. Details will be announced next Wednesday. The financing is expected to total more than $26 billion of three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds. In the past, the enormous size of these quarterly financing operations often has created congestion in the credit markets, leading at least temporarily to higher interest rates.    Corporate and municipal bonds also were little changed yesterday. In the municipal arena, investment managers thus far have shown little reaction to the Supreme Court's decision last week that Congress has the power to tax interest on municipal bonds. Some experts, though, argue that the high court ruling will encourage Congress to enact additional limits on tax-exempt bond issuance.    &quot;I think there will be more incursions by Congress&quot; into the field of tax-exempt bonds, said Robert Boyden Lamb, professor of finance and management at New York University's Graduate School of Business and the author of several books on state and local government bonds.    &quot;I don't think it will happen right away,&quot; said Mr. Lamb. &quot;I also don't think Congress will totally abolish tax-exemption. But there will be more limits, more restrictions&quot; imposed on tax-exempts.    Investors yesterday gave a warm reception to New York state's huge sale of $2.6 billion of short-term notes. The tax and revenue anticipation notes, which come due on March 31 of next year, initially were priced to yield 4.80%. But the yield later was reduced to 4.75%.    In the Treasury bond market yesterday, the government's 8 7/8% bonds due 2017 were quoted late in the afternoon at a price of 98 1/2, down slightly from 98 21/32 Tuesday. The government's 8 1/8% notes due 1998 declined slightly to 95 20/32 from 95 23/32, as the yield rose to 8.80% from 8.78%.    An index of long-term Treasury bonds, compiled by Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., declined 1.68 point to 1246.17. The index ranged between 1245.19 and 1248.51.    Interest rates fell slightly once again on short-term Treasury bills. Three-month bills were quoted late in the day at 5.86% bid, down from 5.90% Tuesday, while six-month bills were quoted at 6.22% bid, down from 6.25%.    Here are details of yesterday's auction of two-year Treasury notes:   Rates are determined by the difference between the purchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrows the investor's return while lower bidding widens it.                         2-year Notes Applications ........................... $26,082,620,000 Accepted bids ........................... $8,526,170,000 Accepted at low price .............................. 18% Accepted noncompetitively ................. $975,000,000 Average price (Rate) ..................... 99.973(7.64%) High price (Rate) ........................ 99.991(7.63%) Low price (Rate) ......................... 99.955(7.65%) Interest rate ................................... 7 5/8%   The notes are dated May 2 and mature April 30, 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
