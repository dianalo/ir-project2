Hunt (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Euphoric Democrats left Atlanta Friday after a week of extolling the need for good jobs, higher wages, equal opportunities, better child care and decent health care. But they said little about foreign policy or national security.    That was no accident. Michael Dukakis, the party's presidential nominee, faced a choice last week: He could present his views on national security and make the case that he, rather than George Bush, is better equipped to sit across the table from Mikhail Gorbachev; or he could finesse any serious discussion of foreign policy, calculating that this isn't a top priority for most voters and isn't his strength.    The Massachusetts governor opted for the latter approach, and that could prove to be a mistake. Former President Carter, for instance, warns that Democrats are likely to lose unless they are seen as favoring a strong national defense. Democratic pollster Peter Hart, who thinks the convention generally was a strong political plus for Mr. Dukakis, nevertheless worries about the &quot;lost opportunity&quot; to address national security problems.    Michael Dukakis has a problem here. The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll 10 days ago showed Mr. Dukakis clearly preferred over Vice President George Bush in general and on most domestic issues. But on foreign policy the results were just the opposite. By 49% to 30%, voters think Mr. Bush would do a better job maintaining a strong national defense and by almost the same margin they believe the vice president would better handle relations with the Soviet Union.    It is true that in times of peace people pay more attention to the economy and other issues directly affecting them. But American voters establish a &quot;gateway&quot; test: A presidential candidate first has to establish that he is competent on foreign policy and then other issues dominate. If a candidate doesn't pass through this gateway, then he doesn't get a chance elsewhere.    Michael Dukakis gives the Republicans ammunition. With the exception of the Stealth bomber, he opposes almost every major nuclear-weapons system. He can justify each stand, but taken together, they present a dovish portrait.    And he gets himself into a trap when he says a Dukakis administration will focus instead on conventional readiness. That position is inconsistent with his pledge to hold down defense spending; conventional buildups are enormously expensive.    Moreover, the Democratic nominee repeatedly talks about reliance on multilateral approaches and using the United Nations more. The Reagan administration has blundered badly at times in not fashioning a shared approach with allies; the fiasco in Panama is one example. But the suggestion that the U.N. or the Organization of American States really can solve major conflicts smacks of naive Wilsonian idealism.    Mr. Dukakis has yet to address the sorts of circumstances where he would use force, except the obvious and easy pledge to defend Europe. The Republicans aren't going to let the Democratic ticket duck this issue all the way to November.    The Dukakis selection of Lloyd Bentsen for the vice presidential slot helps with more-conservative voters. But the Texas Democrat doesn't have sufficient foreign policy credentials -- he serves on the Intelligence Committee but spends most of his time as chairman of the Finance Committee -- to counter concerns that Mr. Dukakis lacks foreign policy expertise.    Vice President Bush -- former ambassador to the U.N., envoy to China, and director of the Central Intelligence Agency -- has considerable foreign policy experience. But he also has some weaknesses. His involvement with Panama strongman Manuel Antonio Noriega and the Iran/Contra scandal are two. &quot;Iran/Contra may impugn his credentials,&quot; ventures Republican political analyst Kevin Phillips.    Even if events don't turn against Mr. Bush, Mr. Dukakis may be able to minimize his lack of foreign policy experience. He is tough and bright, and if the election were held today he would win.    But Congressman Richard Gephardt of Missouri, a rival for the Democratic nomination, once charged that the Massachusetts governor's foreign policy experience was limited &quot;to negotiating with New Hampshire Gov. Sununu over a nuclear power plant.&quot; In an otherwise strong performance, Mike Dukakis did little last week to prevent George Bush from stealing that line during this campaign. </TEXT></DOC>
