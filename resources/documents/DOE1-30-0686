<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-30-0686 </DOCNO><TEXT>Computer codes are reviewed and briefly characterized, used by the NuclearPower Plant Research Institute for calculating neutron physics characteristicsof WWER type reactors. Part of the software was obtained within scientificand technical cooperation of CMEA countries and adapted to ES computers.Some computer codes were improved using experience from calculationsof reactors of the Bohunice nuclear power plant. Fuel cycle planningcodes represent a separate group of computer codes. They were writtenby the Nuclear Power Plant Research Institute in response to the requirementsof practice. They form a basis for further improvement of the utilizationof nuclear fuel in Czechoslovakia. (author). 15 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
