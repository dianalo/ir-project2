The following events have occurred since the publication ofthat notice. On November 9, 1988, the PRC trading companies requested that we postponemaking our final determination for a period of sixty days pursuant to section735(a)(2)(A) of the Act. On November 17, 1988, we issued a notice postponingthe final determination until March 17, 1989 (53 FR 47741). We verified the questionnaire responses in the PRC between November 20and December 12, 1988. The surrogate responses were verified in the Philippineson December 15-16, 1988. On January 25, 1989, the Department held a public hearing. Petitioner andrespondents also submitted comments for the record in prehearing briefson January 23, 1989, and in posthearing briefs on February 9, 1989. Animporter filed comments on November 8, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of the Investigation </ITAG>The United States has developed a system of tariff classification basedon the international harmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January1, 1989, the U.S. tariff schedules were fully converted from the TariffSchedules of the United States Annotated (``TSUSA'') to the HarmonizedTariff Schedule (``HTS''), as provided for in section 1201 et seq. of theOmnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. All merchandise entered,or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after that date is nowclassified solely according to the appropriate HTS number. As with theTSUSA numbers, the HTS numbers are provided for convenience and Customspurposes. The written product description remains dispositive. Imports covered by this investigation are caps, hats, and visors made fromknitted or woven cloth of vegetable fibers including cotton, flax, andramie, of man-made fibers, and/or of blends thereof, and which are cutand sewn. The subject headwear may be adorned with braid, embroidery, orother applied, printed or sewn decoration or may be plain. This investigationdoes not include headwear of straw, felt or wool. The products are classifiedunder the TSUSA item numbers 702.0600, 702,0800, 702.1200, 702.1400, 702.2000,702.3200, 703.0510, 703.0520, 703.0530, 703.0540, 703.0550, 703.0560, 703.1000,703.1610, 703.1620, 703.1630, 703.1640, 703.1650, 384.0438, 384.0954, 384.2211,384.2608, 384.2707, 384.2723, 384.2741, 384.2752, 384.2784, 384.2796, 384.3436,384.5216, 384.5365, 384.5427, 384.5485, 384.5533, 384.5685, 384.5698, 384.8676,384.9443, and under HTS item numbers 6505.90.15, 6505.90.20, 6505.90.25,6505.90.90, 6505.90.50, 6505.90.70, 6505.90.60, 6505.90.80, 6114.20.00,6211.42.00, 6114.30.30, 6211.43.00, 6204.23.00, 6204.29.40, 6211.32.00,6211.49.00, 6211.39.00, 6204.22.30, 6204.29.20, 6209.20.50, 6209.30.30,6209.90.30, 6209.90.40, 6214.90.00. <ITAG tagnum="84">Fair Value Comparison</ITAG>To determine whether sales of the subject merchandise in the United Stateswere made at less than fair value, we compared the United States pricewith the foreign market value.The petitioner has argued that the PRC should be treated as a state-controlledeconomy for purposes of this investigation. The respondents claim thateconomic reforms in the PRC, particularly with respect to the headwearsector, have led to reductions of state-control that make a determinationof foreign market value under section 773(a) of the Act both possible andappropriate.We have examined information submitted by parties concerning this issueand have determined that, although the degree of state control has lessened,particulalry with respect to the production and exportation of headwear,the PRC is appropriately treated as a state-controlled economy for purposesof this investigation. In arriving at this determination the Departmentconsidered: (1) The degree of government ownership of the means of production,(2) the degree of centralized government control over allocation of resourcesor inputs, (3) the degree of centralized government control over outputand (4) the relative convertibility of the country's currency and the degreeof government control over trade. (See <T3>Petroleum Wax Candles from the People's Republic of China, </T3>51FR 25085, July 10, 1986.)Despite the reforms that have been introduced, the Chinese government continuesto own most of the assets in the Chinese economy. In the case of headwear,the eight trading company respondents are state-owned. Of the twenty-sixfactories producing headwear, four are state-owned, sixteen are collective-owned,and six are foreign-owned.Since January 1, 1988, the branches of the national trading companies haveoperated as autonomous entities. According to the responses and informationgathered at verification, neither the trading companies nor the factoriesreport their business or production plans to the State. These facilitiesare responsible for their own profits and losses and are subject to PRCbankruptcy laws. After-tax profits go toward employee welfare and benefits,business expansion and retained earnings. Any losses that are incurredare financed out of retained earnings or borrowing.Wile these factors suggest that decisions to invest assets in the productionand exportation of headwear may be guided more by economic considerationsthan by the direction of the government, there are certain rigidities presentin the system which militate against this conclusion. For example, state-ownedentities channel after-tax profits into specified `'funds,'' includingbusiness expansion, according to government-set or suggested percentages.Thus, as long as an entity remains profitable it will continue its operationswithout any apparent consideration of whether the assets may be more usefullyemployed in other lines of business. Also, we found no evidence that entitiescould sell their assets or discharge their ownership.With respect to the degree of centralized government control over inputs,the major physical inputs used in producing the headwear under investigationare cotton and polyester. The decision of which inputs to use is basedon customer specifications.Most of the cotton used in headwear manufacturing is grown in the PRC andthere is heavy government involvement in the production of cotton cloth.Not only is the State the largest purchaser of raw cotton (90 percent)but it is also the major consumer of cotton cloth (50 percent). Headwearproducers purchase their cotton textiles from outside the government planand are, therefore, able to choose their supplier and negotiate priceswith that supplier, although the government provides suggested prices forinformational purposes.Despite the fact that cotton cloth purchased by headwear producers is outsidethe government plan, the large presence of the government in the productionof cotton cloth would indicate that its actions affect the prices and quantitiesavailable for producers outside the plan. Given the government's involvement,we are not persuaded that there are sufficient market-like influences todetermine that the prices paid by the headwear producers for cotton clothare market-driven.All polyester used by the headwear producers subject to the investigatonis imported. All such importations are made through state-owned tradingcompanies and all headwear produced from the imported materials must bere-exported.With respect to labor, there are indications of increased flexibility inthe labor pool, although there is also evidence of continued rigidity.We saw evidence that workers could be fired and that employee bonuses werebased on the profitability of the enterprise. Nevertheless, in many casesit appeared that wages were set by national and/or local labor bureausand that ``professional'' employees, in particular, faced difficultiesin moving from job-to-job.Thus the extent of government control over the allocaton of inputs presentsa mixed picture. While certain market-like phenomena are present, suchas employee bonuses based on profits and the ability of headwear producersand headwear exporters to choose their suppliers and negotiate prices,the government continues to play an important role, directly or indirectly,in the allocation of inputs to the headwear sector.The degree of centralized government control over outputs is also a mixedpicture. Within the broad terms of their licenses, the trading companiesare able to export the products they choose and to negotiate the pricesthey receive. The factories also appear capable of changing the productsthey produce, or at least the product mix, and to negotiate the pricesthey receive from the trading companies. At the same time, the decisionto export headwear remains in the hands of the government because tradecontinues to be a state monopoly. While we found no evidence of specificquantity targets for the trading companies exporting headwear, they haverecently entered into contracts with the State which specifies foreignexchange targets.Finally, with respect to currency convertibility and government controlover international trade, the government continues to maintain a monopolyin foreign trade, as noted above. This, in and of itself, does not necessarilymean that the PRC should be treated as a state-controlled economy, especiallyin light of the growing autonomy of the trading companies and the reducedimport licensing requirements. For example, headwear is imported into thePRC and, therefore, the state monopoly in trade does not appear to shielddomestic PRC producers from international competition. Moreover, one ofthe goals of the recently-introduced reforms in the headwear sector isthat the trading companies will perform more as agents acting on behalfof PRC manufacturers, with the result that the manufacturing entities willbe more directly involved in international trade.With respect to currency convertibility, the renminbi is not internationallyconvertible and the government imposes tight controls on foreign exchangeearned through exporting. Nevertheless, the recently-introduced currencyswap centers provide certain PRC enterprises with a ``market'' for buyingor selling foreign exchange. For example, the trading companies involvedin this investigation were able to retain a portion of their foreign exchangereceipts in the form of exchange quotas, and these quotas could be soldin the swap markets or they could be used to purchase imports. At the sametime, however, a large portion of the trading companies' foreign exchangeearning was sold to the government at the official exchange rate and wasnot available to the trading companies. Even more limited access to foreignexchange was experienced by the factories producing headwear for export.Based on the above, the Department believes that the Chinese foreign tradesystem is in transition. In many ways it is like a developing market economycountry. On the other hand, many of respondents' claims are based on reformsthat were instituted during the period of investigation. This makes questionablethe extent to which these reforms could have had an impact on the pricesin the sector during the same period. Moreover, we received a great dealof individual respondent information which did not support a uniform experienceor conclusion.These considerations, combined with evidence of continuing indirect controlexercised by the Chinese government, lead us to determine that the headwearsector is state-controlled for purposes of this investigation. Such evidenceof control is indicated by State mandated after-tax outlays and foreignexchange earning targets; the State monopoly on foreign trade; currencyquota allocation; the involvement of the government in the cotton marketas well as the limited convertibility of the currency. However, if futurechanges occur in these areas as a result of diminished government control,the Department will be willing to reconsider its conclusions in any futurereview, should this investigation result in an antidumping duty order.There are two types of transactions involved in exporting the subject merchandiseto the United States: processing fee and non-processing fee. Processingfee sales are those sales where the PRC factories are responsible onlyfor converting supplied materials into finished headwear. Consistent withpast practice, we have based United States price for the processing feesales on the price received for the conversion. (See, <T3>e.g., Small Diameter Welded Carbon Steel Pipes and Tubes from the Philippines,Final Determination of Sales at Less Than Fair Value, </T3>(51 FR 33099,September 18, 1986), (<T3>Pipes and Tubes from the Philippines</T3>); <T3>Brass Sheet and Strip from Canada, Final Determination of Sales atLess Than Fair Value, </T3>(51 FR 44319, December 9, 1986), (<T3>Canadian Brass Sheet and Strip</T3>).) Foreign market value for processingfee sales was calculated by valuing the factors of production employedby the PRC manufacturers in performing the conversion in a non-state-controlledeconomy country, as described in the ``Foreign Market Value'' section ofthis notice.For non-processing fee sales, the United States price is based on the pricescharged by the PRC trading companies for finished headwear. The foreignmarket value for these sales has been calculated using PRC factors of productionvalued in a non-state-controlled economy, as described in the ``ForeignMarket Value'' section of this notice.<ITAG tagnum="84">United States Price</ITAG>We used the purchase price of the subject merchandise to represent UnitedStates price because the merchandise was sold to unrelated purchasers priorto its importation into the United States. We calculated the purchase priceof the subject merchandise as provided in section 772 of the Act, on thebasis of the Candamp;F or CIF prices with deductions, where applicable, forocean freight, and marine insurance. An adjustment for taxes rebated onexport was not added to U.S. price since the amount of rebate actuallyreceived could not be verified.<ITAG tagnum="84">Foreign Market Value </ITAG>As a result of our determination to treat the PRC as a state-controlledeconomy, section 773(c) of the Act requires us to base foreign market valueon either the prices of, or the constructed value of, such or similar merchandisein a ``non-state-controlled-economy'' country. Our regulations establish a preference for foreign market value based uponsales prices. They further stipulate that, to the extent possible, we shoulduse information from a ``non-state-controlled-economy'' country at a stageof economic development comparable to the state-controlled-economy country.As noted in the preliminary determination, we sent a questionnaire to,and received a response from a headwear producer in the Philippines. Sincethe preliminary determination we have received a supplemental responsefrom this manufacturer and we were able to verify both response in December1988. We did not use information on domestic sales provided by this ``surrogate''producer as the foreign market value for PRC sales of polyester headwearsince the Department determined that the surrogate merchandise was notsufficiently similar to serve as a basis of comparison. For these sales,we constructed foreign market value by valuing the factors of productionemployed by the PRC manufacturers using factor cost information providedby the surrogate. This methodology was also utilized for sales of cottonhats with the exception of the cotton input. For the value of the cottoninput, we based the factor information on the customs value of U.S. importsfrom Egypt. For processing fee sales, we constructed foreign market valueby valuing the factors of production employed by the PRC manufacturersin performing the conversion using factor cost information provided bythe surrogate. Foreign market value based on valuing factors of productionincludes the statutory minimum for SGandamp;A and profit. <ITAG tagnum="84">Currency Conversions </ITAG>When evaluating U.S. sales made in Hong Kong dollars, we made currencyconversions in accordance with andSection; 353.56(a)(1) of our regulations,using certified exchange rates as furnished by the Federal Reserve Bankof New York. Because we did not have certified exchange rates from theFederal Reserve Bank of New York for the surrogate country data, as bestinformation we used currency conversions based on monthly averages as providedby the International Monetary Fund. <ITAG tagnum="84">Negative Determination of Critical Circumstances </ITAG>Petitioner alleged that imports of headwater from the PRC present ``criticalcircumstances.'' Section 735(a)(3) of the Act provides that critical circumstancesexist if we determine that there is a reasonable basis to believe or suspectthat: <ITAG tagnum="21">(A)(i) There is a history of dumping in the United States or elsewhereof the class or kind of merchandise which is the subject of the investigation,or </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(ii) The person by whom, or for whose account, the merchandise wasimported knew or should have known that the exporter was selling the merchandisewhich is the subject of the investigation at less than fair value, and</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(B) there have been massive imports of the merchandise which is thesubject of the investigation over a relatively short period.</ITAG>Pursuant to section 735(a)(3)(B), we generally consider the following factorsin determining whether imports have been massive over a relatively shortperiod of time: (1) The volume and value of the imports; (2) seasonal trends(if applicable); and (3) the share of domestic consumption accounted forby imports.For purposes of this finding, we analyzed recent trade statistics on importlevels for headwear from the PRC, for equal periods immediately precedingand following the filing of the petition until the month of our preliminarydetermination. Using this data, we find that there has been less than aone percent increase in imports of headwear following the initiation ofthis investigation.Since we do not find that there have been massive imports, we need notconsider whether there is a history of dumping or whether importers knewor should have known that it was being sold at less than fair value. Therefore,we determine that critical circumstances do not exist with respect to importsof headwear from the PRC. We have notified the ITC of this determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Verification</ITAG>As provided in section 776(b) of the Act, we verified all information usedin reaching the final determination in this investigation. We used standardverification procedures, including examination of relevant accounting recordsand original source documents provided by respondents. <ITAG tagnum="84">General Comments </ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Both the petitioner and the respondents have commentedon various methodological issues pertaining to the analysis if the Departmenthad found the headwear sector to be non-state-controlled for the purposesof the investigation. These comments included whether the Department shoulduse third country sales information and whether the Department should usethe official exchange rate or the swap rate when making currency conversions.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>Since the Department determined the headwearsector to be state-controlled, these comments are not addressed. <ITAG tagnum="84">Petitioners' Comments </ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Petitioner argues that the PRC is a state-controlledeconomy and should be treated as such under the antidumping law. <T3>Department's Position. </T3>We agree. See the ``Foreign Market Value''section of this notice. <T3>Comment 2. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department has correctlychosen to use the surrogate information provided by a headwear manufacturerin the Philippines. In making its final determination, the Department shouldcontinue to use the home market sales made by the surrogate as the basisof foreign market value for non-processing fee sales. <T3>Department's Position. </T3>Department regulations establish a preferencefor foreign market value of such or similar merchandise based upon salesprices prior to constructing a cost based value of the merchandise. Atverification we confirmed that the Philippine home market sales consistexclusively of embroidered headwear. The Department verified the cost ofinformation submitted by the surrogate producer including the cost of embroidery.The cost differences associated with embroidery were found to be of sufficientmagnitude to preclude a reasonable comparison with sales of unembroideredheadwear. Moreover, the Department is unable to make a determination asto the similarity of the embroidered headwear sold in the Philippines andthat sold by the PRC because no factor information on the embroidery component,such as the number of stiches or the time involved, was provided by thePRC respondents producing embroidered headwear. Due to the limited numberof sales of embroidered headwear sold by respondents in this investigation,in its final determination, the Department has disregarded these salesin its analysis. For all other sales, the Department has used the costinformation supplied by the surrogate in valuing the factor informationfrom the PRC respondents as described in the ``Foreign Market Value'' sectionof this notice.<T3>Comment 3. </T3>The petitioner contends that the affirmative preliminarydetermination of critical circumstances for three specific trading companiesshould be expanded to include all of the PRC trading companies. In itspreliminary determination the Department imputed ``knowledge that dumpingwas occurring'' to those three trading companies whose margins were greaterthan 25 percent. Since the PRC is a non-market economy country with centralcontrol and direction, the companies act in unison and knowledge is sharedamong them. Therefore, knowledge should be imputed to all of the state-ownedtrading companies. The petitioner also argues that it was appropriate touse a three month time period in evaluating whether massive imports existedfor our determination of critical circumstances.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>Although the Department relied on a threemonth period in making its preliminary affirmative critical circumstancedetermination, we have used the five months between the filing of the petitionand the preliminary determination for our final determination. The Departmentuses this period between the filing of the petition and the preliminarydetermination to determine whether there are massive imports since thisis the period during which respondents could take advantage of their knowledgeof the dumping case to increase exports to the United States without beingsubject to dumping duties. See <T3>Internal Combustion, Industrial Forklift Trucks from Japan, </T3>53FR 12566, April 15, 1988. During this time, the import statistics indicatethat PRC headwear imports increased less than one percent. Having determinedthat imports during the period were not massive, the Department need notconsider whether importers of this product knew or should have known thatthe merchandise from the PRC was being sold at less than fair value. (Seethe ``Negative Determination of Critical Circumstances'' section of thisnotice.)<T3>Comment 4. </T3>Petitioner argues that the Department should issueone rate to all PRC trading companies or at most, two rates_one to ChinaArts and Crafts and one to China Light_because the State owns and controlsall PRC trading companies. The establishment of nine rates with large marginvariations facilitates circumvention in a state-controlled economy whereexports can be easily directed and diverted among the trading companiesby the State.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>We disagree that one, or two, dumping marginsshould be calculated in this investigation. The former branches of thenational trading companies have separated from the national companies andwe found no evidence that the prices the branches charge for exports tothe United States are set by or coordinated through the national tradingcompanies. Therefore, it is appropriate to calculate separate margins foreach of the now independent trading companies. Moreover, in past findingswhere different national trading companies exported to the United States,we calculated separate rates for these trading companies even though wetreated the PRC as a state-controlled economy (See, <T3>e.g., Shop Towels from the People's Republic of China; Final Resultsof Administrative Review of Antidumping Duty Order </T3>(50 FR 26020, June24, 1985)).<T3>Comment 5. </T3>Petitioner claims that because of the poor qualityof the responses and the number of discrepancies found at verification,the Department should reject the questionnaire responses as inadequateand unreliable and use best information available, <T3>i.e., </T3>information provided by the petitioner. In addition, theDepartment should reject last minute revisions as unverified.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>The majority of the information providedin the PRC companies' responses to the factors of production and salesquestionnaires was verified. Some of the last minute filings referred toby the petitioner were made to place information on the record that wascorrected at verification. Furthermore, any information submitted by therespondents that was not verified was not used in our final determinationexcept in those instances where it was used as best information available.<T3>Comment 6. </T3>Petitioner contends that the respondents have failedto provide information fully describing product codes and identifying whichof the headwear exports are embroidered. Therefore, as best informationavailable, the Department should assume one-third of all headwear importsare embroidered.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>For all but one of the trading companies,Jiangsu Arts and Crafts, we were able to verify which headwear orders includedembroidered hats based on our examination of representative sales documentation.For Jiangsu Arts and Crafts, where we were unable to identify specificsales which included embroidered headwear, information submitted by Jiangsufollowing verification mirrors the experience of the largest known exporterof embroidered headwear, <T3>i.e.,</T3> an insignificant percent of total sales. Due to the limitedvolume of sales involved, the Department has dropped these sales from itsanalysis.<T3>Comment 7. </T3>The petitioner argues that the Department was correctin not considering Universal Hats and Caps Manufacturing Company, Ltd.,and Universal Trading Company (``Universal'') as well as Golden Crown asrespondents in the investigation because these Hong Kong companies arenot PRC manufacturers, producers or exporters of headwear. Furthermore,since the PRC trading companies must obtain export visas for all shipmentsto the United States, U.S. price is appropriately based on the PRC tradingcompanies' prices given their knowledge that the merchandise is destinedfor the U.S. market.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>We agree. See our response to InterestedParty Comment 1.<ITAG tagnum="84">Respondent's Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1. </T3>Respondents argue that the PRC headwear sector is notstate-controlled.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>We disagree. See discussion above in the``Foreign Market Value'' section of this notice.<T3>Comment 2. </T3>The Department should not use the surrogate countryproducer's domestic sales prices as the basis for foreign market valuefor the following reasons: (1) The volume of home market sales was toosmall to have been made in commercial quantities, (2) they were not inthe ordinary course of trade, and (3) the sales price was extraordinarilyhigh and totally unrepresentative of any fair measure of foreign marketvalue. In addition, as the Department learned at verification, the surrogate'sheadwear was embroidered which significantly adds to the cost of producingthe merchandise. Most of the headwear sold by the trading companies, however,is not embroidered. For these reasons, the Department should use the factorcost information for its constructed value of polyester baseball caps.Alternatively, the cost of embroidery should be deducted from the surrogate'sprice in the calculation of foreign market value, except for those salesof embroidered headwear.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>The Department verified the cost informationsubmitted by the surrogate including the cost of embroidery and from thatinformation was able to determine that embroidered hats could not reasonablybe compared to unembroidered hats. Since the number of embroidered headwearsales made by PRC respondents was insignificant, and the Department couldnot determine the similarity of PRC embroidered headwear with that of thesurrogate, embroidered headwear sales have been dropped from our analysis.Because the Department has not used the home market sales of the surrogatefor comparison purposes in our final determination, we have not addressedrespondents' additional concerns about the home market.<T3>Comment 3. </T3>Respondents claim that they provided information onwhich exports of Chinese headwear were embroidered and that this informationshould be utilized in making fair value comparisons.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>See our response to petitioner's comment6.<T3>Comment 4. </T3>Respondents claim that critical circumstances do notexist because imports have not been massive. Further, the Department shouldnot impute knowledge of sales at less than fair value to importers usingresults based on information supplied by a surrogate. This is a particularlyunreasonable assumption in the case where a surrogate's home market priceis being used for foreign market value. It is unlikely that importers ofPRC headwear have knowledge that sales are being made at less than fairvalue based on knowledge of a particular surrogate's pricing practicesin an industry where potential suppliers are numerous and prices from allsuch sources would need to be known.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>The Department agrees that the requirementsfor an affirmative determination of critical circumstances have not beenmet. (See the ``Negative Determination of Critical Circumstances'' sectionof this notice.) For this reason, the Department need not consider theissue of the importers knowledge of sales at less than fair value.<T3>Comment 5. </T3>Respondents claim that the Department incorrectly usedthe CIF value of Egyptian cotton for the cotton input cost in constructingforeign market value. The headwear factories in China purchase the cottoncloth domestically and do not incur any ocean freight or marine insurancecharges. Since the CIF value includes ocean freight and marine insurance,the Department instead should use the FOB value of Egyptian cotton foundon the same customs statistics.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>We agree and have used the import valueexclusive of transportation and insurance expenses for the cost of thecotton input in our final determination.<T3>Comment 6. </T3>Respondents claim that the Department should utilizethe verified revised labor hour calculations submitted prior to verification.In the initial responses the factories were only able to estimate the laborhour figures because of tight time limits. These estimates were considerablyhigher than the actual amounts.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>The Department did receive a number ofrevised figures at the time of verification. In our final determination,we have accepted those revised figures which were submitted prior to thebeginning of verification and which were acceptably verified.<ITAG tagnum="84">Interested Party Comments</ITAG><T3>Comment 1.</T3> The interested party, Universal, argues that the Departmentis incorrect in refusing to investigate Universal's claim that it is manufacturer.Nonetheless, even if the Department does not accept Universal's contentionthat it is the manufacturer of the hats under investigation, Universalclaims that it is at least acting as a trading company (where the manufacturerhas no knowledge of the destination of the goods) and is entitled to aseparate determination. Because Universal contracts with the Chinese tradingcompany prior to receiving specific orders from its U.S. and third countrycustomers, Universal contends that at the time the contract is enteredinto neither the factory nor the PRC trading company knows where the hatswill be exported.<T3>Department's Position.</T3> Universal is a Hong Kong company whichsupplies materials to the PRC factories for conversion into headwear underprocessing fee arrangements with the PRC trading companies. As such, Universalis not a PRC manufacturer, producer, or exporter. In recent proceedingsinvolving processing fee-like arrangements, we have treated the processoras the producer/manufacturer/exporter and have based United States priceon the price paid for processing. (<T3>See, e.g., Pipes and Tubes from the Philippines, Canadian Brass Sheetand Strip</T3>).Moreover, the Department does not agree with Universal's contention thattrading companies did not have knowledge of the destination of the merchandise.Specifically, the PRC trading companies are aware that the processing feesales are destined for the United States because they must supply the exportvisas required under the U.S.-PRC bilateral textile agreement. Consistentwith Department practice, where a seller knows that the merchandise isdestined for the United States, we base United States price on the pricecharged by the seller. The respondents in this investigation, some of whomsupply Universal, have stated that they have knowledge of or can inferthe destination of the merchandise. During the period of investigation,two of these suppliers did not have any third country sales and were producingexclusively for the U.S. market. For these reasons, we are not consideringUniversal as a respondent in this investigation.<T3>Comment 2. </T3>Universal contends that the reasons the Departmenthas given for finding the headwear sector to be state-controlled do notapply to the Universal factories. Because the Chinese state-owned tradingcompanies serve merely as the issuer of the visas and financial intermediaryfor U.S. sales by Universal, and have no role in making sales to the U.S.or elsewhere for the Universal factories, there is no basis for findingforeign exchange targets for the Universal factories. With respect to currencyconvertibility, all of Universal's raw materials are purchased at arm'slength from unrelated suppliers and the transactions are in hard currency.Moreover, all of Universal's transactions occur in U.S. dollars. Therefore,the convertibility or non-convertibility of the renminbi is completelyinapplicable to sales from Universal's factories. Finally, all sales ofthe merchandise are negotiated between Universal and its customer in theUnited States. The Chinese state-owned trading companies do not act inthe role of a trading company that negotiates sales. Therefore, becauseof the lack of state control over Universal's operations, the Departmentshould analyze Universal's sales on the basis of normal, market-orienteddumping methodology.<T3>Department's Position. </T3>Having determined that Universal is nota respondent in this investigation, we are concerned with the economicactivity occurring within the PRC by respondents who are Universal's suppliers.We have determined that the headwear sector in the PRC is state-controlledfor purposes of this investigation. For this reason, in our foreign marketvalue construction, we utilized the factor information supplied by thePRC factories valued in a market economy. Specifically, foreign marketvalue for the sales to Universal were valued using the factor informationfor conversion from factories investigated that supply Universal. Sincethese transactions involve only conversion, the fact that Universal purchasedmaterials in a hard currency does not enter our analysis. U.S. price wasthe price charged Universal for conversion by the PRC trading company respondents.<ITAG tagnum="84">Suspension of Liquidation</ITAG>Since we have determined that critical circumstances do not exist withregard to this investigation, entries suspended prior to November 8, 1988,the date of publication of the preliminary determination in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> can now be liquidated and all securities postedas a result of the suspension of liqudation prior to that date will berefunded or cancelled. We are directing the U.S. Customs Service to continueto suspend liquidation of all entries of headwear from the PRC that areentered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after November8, 1988.
