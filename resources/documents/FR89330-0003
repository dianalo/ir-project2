These protocolsspecify requirements for importations through HSTAIC of swine from China.The swine should improve the germplasm of breeding animals in the UnitedStates, eventually improving the productivity and international competitivenessof U.S. swine.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>March 24, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Dr. Samuel S. Richeson, SeniorStaff Veterinarian, Import-Export Products Staff, Veterinary Services,APHIS, USDA, Room 759, Federal Building, 6505 Belcrest Road, Hyattsville,MD 20782, (301) 436-8144.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On July 25, 1988, we published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 27846-27847, Docket Number 88-107) aninterim rule that amended the regulations in 9 CFR Part 92, andSection; 92.41,by granting the Agricultural Research Service (ARS) of the United StatesDepartment of Agriculture the exclusive right to use the Harry S TrumanAnimal Import Center (HSTAIC) for an importation of swine from the People'sRepublic of China during calendar year 1989. We affirmed that interim rulein a document published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 8, 1989 (54 FR 9768-9770, Docket Number88-153).The interim rule allows ARS to import swine from the People's Republicof China through HSTAIC in calendar year 1989, in accordance with proceduresdetermined by the Secretary of Agriculture. The interim rule also statedthat protocols governing the procedures for this importation would be publishedfor comment prior to the importation.These protocols were published in a proposed rule in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on March 8, 1989 (54 FR 9836-9842, Docket Number89-015). The proposed rule contained procedures for safe importation ofswine from China, including overseas quarantine of swine from China priorto their importation, and procedures required for the swine from the timethey leave China until their release from quarantine at HSTAIC.Our proposal invited the submission of written comments, which were requiredto be postmarked or received on or before March 23, 1989. We did not receiveany comments. Based on the rationale set forth in the proposal and in thisdocument, we are adopting the provisions of the proposal as a final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date</ITAG>Pursuant to the provisions of 5 U.S.C. 553, we find good cause for makingthis rule effective less than 30 days after publication in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Arrangements for the shipment and quarantineof Chinese swine have already been completed by the Agricultural ResearchService and the People's Republic of China. Delay in allowing the importationto proceed would disrupt research schedules and would lengthen the periodduring which the Harry S Truman Animal Import Center is unavailable foruses other than the importation of swine from China. Therefore, the Administratorof the Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service has determined that thisfinal rule should be effective upon signature.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationcompiled by the Department, we have determined that this rule will havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.This rule enables ARS to import approximately 144 swine for research onthe possibility of improving the germplasm of breeding swine in the UnitedStates. If improved breeding stock is developed, it should eventually benefitbreeders in the private sector.In December 1986, the swine population of the United States was approximately51,000,000, of which approximately 6,612,000 were intended for breedingpurposes. The ARS shipment is very small compared to this population, andis destined for research facilities instead of the normal market channelsin the United States.There are two potential effects resulting from adoption of this rule, oneimmediate and one long-term. The first impact is the costs involved inimporting the shipment of Chinese swine in accordance with the rule, estimatedat $497,000. All costs associated with the importation of the swine willbe borne by ARS.The second possible impact is indirect and could occur only after yearsof research and development involving the imported swine. This impact wouldbe development of improved breeds of U.S. swine incorporating desirabletraits of the imported Chinese swine. If such development is successful,productivity of U.S. swine could increase, resulting in savings for swineproducers and decreases in domestic consumer prices for pork and pork products.Since over 98 percent of U.S. swine producers qualify as small entities,higher swine productivity would have a beneficial effect on small entities.Higher swine productivity may be achieved only if numerous activities outsidethe scope of this rule occur, such as successful research results, developmentof improved breeds that are marketable, and acceptance and distributionof improved breeds by the marketplace.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>The regulations in this rule contain no information collection or recordkeepingrequirements under the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501<T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials.
