The number of makeshift shelters has doubled in the past weekafter growing steadily for several months, said police Capt. DennisMartel. He said he fields about 10 complaints a week about theshantytown.   Advocates for the homeless and some shantytown residents say theyfear any trouble breaking out at the plaza could cause police tosweep in and make arrests despite a pledge by Mayor Art Agnos to letthem stay.   A city ordinance forbids sleeping in parks. But Agnos has anunwritten pact with the rag-tag group, which grows to as many as 400people nightly: They can remain beneath the plaza's olive treesuntil he implements his housing programs, but there must be nopublic defecation, no structures and no harassment of passersby.   Opponents say the rules have been ignored, making the shantytowna health and safety threat. Agnos, urging patience, says police are``diplomatically'' reminding the homeless of the rules.   ``I believe the people of San Francisco have the good will andcompassion to accept this temporary situation until we as a city canprovide the substantive, meaningful, humane alternatives we allwant,'' Agnos said.   Social worker Lorett Vergara of the non-profit Tenderloin HousingClinic said she has been able to house 22 people from the plaza.Although she has identified 61 people with job skills, she has beenable to find work for only three.   ``The mayor's doing all he can do, and he's bucking a lot ofpeople to do it,'' Vergara said.   Public pressure for a crackdown has grown with an increase ofauto break-ins, assaults, public drunkenness and indecent exposureat the plaza, said police Sgt. Jerry Senkir.   Last week, a couple complained that while they ate lunch in theplaza, one man exposed himself, another urinated next to their benchand a third demanded money while threatening them with a pipe.   ``We're trying to keep the lid on this situation, but whether ornot we're going to be able to enforce city law or not remains to beseen; mainly we're waiting to see what happens from the mayor'soffice,'' Senkir said.   The shantytown homeless claim that for several days this weekpolice arrived with bullhorns at 4 a.m., warning people they mustremove structures or face eviction. Senkir said bullhorns were onlyused once.   Under former Mayor Dianne Feinstein, the city spent millions eachyear providing temporary shelter for the city's 10,000 homeless.Agnos, who took office 18 months ago, called that a wasteful,dead-end approach.   He has cut back use of hotels and has earmarked $1.5 million innext year's budget for ``transitional housing'' where homelesspeople can spend the night, do laundry, make phone calls, receivemail and get job counseling and welfare services. Agnos said Tuesdaythe city had received $6 million in federal grants to support hishomelessness programs.   ``The homeless aren't all just alcoholics or drug users,'' said23-year-old Kevin, who like other shantytown residents would tell areporter only his first name. ``But those kinds of people have takenover out here so it's giving the rest of us a bad name.''   ``I come here for the camaraderie,'' said 33-year-old Reggie,homeless for several years and sharing a bottle of cheap wine withthree fellow campers about 9 a.m.   ``We all look out for each other here,'' Reggie said. ``There'sstrength in numbers.''</TEXT></DOC>
