(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The 150-year-old rush to live in theGolden State has swelled the population to 28.3 million, making oneof every nine people in the nation a Californian, researchers saidMonday.   The population estimate for the fiscal year ending last July 1,up a record 662,000 over the year before, places the nation's mostpopulous state more than 10 million people ahead of the nextlargest state, New York, with 17.8 million, said officials in thestate Finance Department's Demographic Research Unit.   ``We just have too much to offer everyone, I guess,'' said JohnMalson, a manager in the unit.   The migration of people into California, which started with theGold Rush of 1849, outstripped the number who left in 1987-88,adding 372,000 to the population and accounting for 56 percent ofthe overall increase, he said.   The gain through migration, though a continuing trend, was thegreatest of modern times, exceeded only by the fluctuations due toWorld War II, Malson said. The previous year's gain was 366,000.   The other 44 percent in population growth was due to a greaternumber of births than deaths, he said. Births totaled 504,000;deaths, 215,000.   California's 28.3 million total population was up 2.4 percentover the 27.6 million on July 1, 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
