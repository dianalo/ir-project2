He has taken the story of the breakup of the Bell System in January 1984 and made it readable. By telling it through the personalities of the bureaucrats, lawyers, politicians and executives involved, Mr. Coll avoids getting mired in the technical and legal jargon that so bored the public at the time of divestiture that most didn't comprehend its magnitude until Ma Bell lay dismembered.    For that alone, the book is worth reading. Those who notice that telephone service is worse and more expensive now than it was three years ago will not be surprised to learn that no one involved in the breakup had a well-thought-out plan for regulating the telecommunications industry.    Rather, divestiture capped a series of deregulatory decisions made during the past two decades that were &quot;driven by opportunism, short-term politics, ego, desperation, miscalculation, happenstance, greed, conflicting ideologies and personalities.&quot; No one, writes Mr. Coll, emerged triumphant from the breakup, &quot;not telephone consumers, not ATandamp;T, not MCI&quot; Communications Corp., whose battle against the Bell System started the whole process.    The book is a telling comment on the industry today. The federal government is just now reassessing the consent decree that broke up the Bell System. It may again tinker with the industry's structure and allow ATandamp;T's offspring into new markets competing directly with their former parent. The financial health of ATandamp;T, MCI and the Bell companies that ATandamp;T divested still depends more on piecemeal decisions issued by courts and regulators than on those companies' abilities -- or lack thereof -- to formulate and execute profitable business strategies.    Mr. Coll also dispels the theory of the breakup still sometimes floated by ATandamp;T executives: that they and their company were victims of power hungry bureaucrats and politicians run amok.    Mr. Coll makes clear that ATandamp;T's own arrogance had much to do with raising suspicions about its motives and causing the government to file its antitrust case in the first place. In the decade before divestiture, the company's executives -- particularly late chairman John D. deButts -- adopted the attitude that only ATandamp;T knew what customers needed; neither customers nor competitors had such expertise. That attitude contributed to the government's belief that ATandamp;T thought it &quot;was above the law,&quot; Mr. Coll writes. Interestingly, ATandamp;T applied a similar arrogance and ignored the market in its early disastrous attempts to sell computers. Last year ATandamp;T's computer business may have posted pre-tax losses of $1 billion, company sources say, and the company has hired an executive from the Italian office automation company, Ing. C. Olivetti, to help revamp the business.    A disturbing weakness of the book is several factual errors. To illustrate how rich William McGowan, the MCI chairman, was becoming in 1981, Mr. Coll characterizes MCI's revenue as &quot;nearing $1 billion.&quot; He later says the company's annual sales &quot;began to approach $2 billion&quot; by the end of the 1970s. In its fiscal year ended March 31, 1981, MCI's revenue actually was $234.2 million; it went up to $506.3 million the following year, still a great deal shy of $1 billion.    He gets the numbers right when illustrating the huge impact of $1.8 billion in trebled damages initially awarded MCI in its private antitrust suit against Ma Bell. (The award was later reduced.) But Mr. Coll can't seem to decide whether MCI was a threat to ATandamp;T or not. Fudging facts doesn't help the reader much.    Mr. Coll does provide some interesting and ironic details. ATandamp;T's chief attorney in the antitrust case, George Saunders, was married to an attorney from MCI's main outside counsel while passionately arguing ATandamp;T's case. At the signing of the consent decree breaking up the company, Morris Tanenbaum, now an ATandamp;T vice chairman with a delightfully sharp mind, cried gently while then-chairman Charles L. Brown &quot;seemed even he might break his cool veneer with a tear of mourning.&quot; Such details are relevant; even today mid-level managers grumble that too many ATandamp;T promotions are based on personality traits rather than performance.    Whether Mr. Coll's dismal view of the futures of MCI and ATandamp;T is correct remains to be seen. He writes that Mr. McGowan and Mr. deButts each &quot;planted the seeds of his company's final destruction&quot; through his head-to-head battle over competition in the phone industry.    Recent events do indicate both companies have some dark years ahead. ATandamp;T is dishing out thousands of severance packages in a desperate attempt to stem huge losses in its unregulated phone equipment and computer business. Recently, financially pressed MCI announced a buyback of its stock to shore up the price, while cutting capital spending and taking a $500 million to $550 million charge against net earnings for network equipment that is obsolete.    ---   Ms. Guyon covers the telecommunications industry in the Journal's New York bureau. </TEXT></DOC>
