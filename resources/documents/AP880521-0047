(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A baby sitter who killed one child andwounded five others before killing herself was remembered by someas a quiet woman who loved children, while others recalled aneccentric with deep psychological problems.   ``She was a sort of a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in that she hadmood swings up and down,'' said John Childs, whose formergirlfriend, Lori Wasserman Dann, was found dead in a barricadedhouse after the shooting spree that began Friday at an elementaryschool. She also wounded a 20-year-old man.   Ms. Dann, 30, ``had her own idiosyncracies,'' said Childs, 34.She loved children, for example, but had ``little compassion'' forhandicapped people, he said.   Ms. Dann's parents ``feel absolutely destroyed by this,'' saidHerbert Timm, the police chief in this affluent Chicago suburb.Only a caretaker answered the phone at the home of her parents,Norman and Edith Wasserman.   Ms. Dann, had ``some very deep psychological problems'' and hadbeen seeing a psychiatrist, Timm said. She also had earlier brusheswith the police in Illinois and Wisconsin.   After the shooting rampage, she telephoned her parents.   ``I have hurt some children. I've done a bad thing. I'm sorry.Please help me,'' she said, according to Timm. She later shotherself once in the head with a .32-caliber pistol.   In Madison, Wis., where Ms. Dann lived during the past year,people remembered her as an eccentric.   She was dubbed ``the elevator woman'' because she rode theelevator for extended periods _ night and day _ in the high-riseresidence where she lived earlier this year, Keith Wilson recalledin a telephone interview with the Wisconsin State Journal.   Wilson, now a Los Angeles resident, lived across the hall fromher in the building near the University of Wisconsin campus.   Another acquaintance, Brian Soifer, told WMAQ radio, ``I neverreally saw her talk to anybody, never saw her eat dinner withanybody. ... (She) watched TV all the time.''   School officials said they had no record of her as a studentafter 1977, and Wilson said he never saw her study.   She attended the University of Arizona in the late 1970s, theschool said.   ``I had to move out because I couldn't live with her,'' formerroommate Lois Wander told the Journal from her home in HighlandPark. ``She was always very weird.''   But residents of Glencoe and neighboring suburbs who knew Ms.Dann couldn't believe the news.   ``I am terribly, terribly shocked, it's unbelievable,'' saidChilds' mother, Alexandra, who recalled that Ms. Dann visited herhome half a dozen times when she was dating her son, often playingwith her grandchildren.   The Wassermans live around the corner from the Childs family ina large, white one-story ranch house in Glencoe, a North Shoresuburb of about 9,000 residents that is the nation's20th-wealthiest suburb with a per-capita income of $35,632 per year.   ``She was a pretty girl, intelligent but reticent ... a listenermore than a talker,'' Mrs. Childs said. ``She might have been alittle different than average, but not in my wildest dreams could Ihave imagined this.''   Craig Bayless of Winnetka, a real-estate broker, remembered Ms.Dann as ``a fine baby sitter'' who looked after his daughterseveral times last summer.   ``We had no real problems at all. Our daughter, who was 3 ...liked her just fine. She was a nice, quiet girl,'' Bayless said.   Yet, Ms. Dann had had several brushes with the law.   Lake County authorities said she was a suspect in the May 1986stabbing of her estranged husband, Russell. She was never charged.   Ms. Dann was arrested on disorderly conduct charges by the LakeCounty state's attorney's office, suspected of making threateningand harassing phone calls. Those charges were dismissed.   In March, she was arrested in Madison, Wis., for shoplifting.   Timm said the FBI had also been preparing to seek chargesagainst Ms. Dann for making death threats to someone in Colorado,possibly her boyfriend.</TEXT></DOC>
