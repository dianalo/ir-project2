 The center began tracking missing and questionable securities for theSEC as a pilot project in 1978.andM;But the SEC's contract with the center expired in September.andP;  The agencyissued a request for proposals soliciting vendors to run the Lost and StolenSecurities System.andM;The SEC said it expects to select a contractor by April.andP;  Officials now arerevising the RFP and hope to issue an amendment by the end of the month.andO;They would not comment on how it would change the current RFP.andM;Thomas Financial Networks created the center specifically to handle the lostand stolen securities program.andP;  Since the first pilot, the center has wonback-to-back five-year contracts to operate the system.andM;John Boehmke, center director, said Thomas Financial officials would notrelease information about the current system because the company is vying forthe new contract and does not want to provide proprietary information toother competitors.andM;Congress mandated the program to cut down on trafficking of illicitsecurities.andP;  By making information about lost or stolen securities readilyavailable to the securities industry, the SEC figured it could pinpoint andimpede illegal activity.andM;The institutions that report to the center -- some 22,500 brokers, dealers,banks and registered transfer agents -- pay fees to verify stock certificatesand other securities against the database.andP;  It now contains roughly 5 millionrecords requiring nearly 750M of storage space.andM;A summary of 1989 activities showed that institutions reported more than860,000 certificates as lost, stolen or counterfeit.andP;  These securities arevalued at $2 billion.andP;  Institutions reported recovery of almost 125,000certificates, worth almost $600 million.andM;Security CheckandM;The system has two chief functions: accepting reports on missing securitiesand responding to inquiries about certificates.andP;  The participatinginstitutions often check securities they obtain to make sure they are neither&quot;hot&quot; nor fraudulent.andM;When they need the data for law enforcement investigations, the SEC and FBIcan obtain free access to the database.andP;  The vendor must report databaseactivities to the SEC monthly and when a match results in a hit, mustimmediately notify the inquiring institution, the SEC and the FBI.andM;Last year, institutions made inquiries on nearly 3 million securitycertificates, an average of 11,500 certificates each day.andP;  Those inquiriesresulted in hits on about 5,300 certificates totaling more than $10 million.andM;Based on 1989 figures, the SEC estimated the vendor will have to processnearly 4,000 reports and inquiries each business day.andM;The SEC released a functional RFP that left technical options up to thebidding vendors.andP;  The winning vendor must provide the system at no cost tothe SEC.andP;  As now, the fees participating institutions pay for using thesystem are supposed to cover operating costs.andP;  But one manager at theSecurities Information Center said the SEC-approved fees are not meant toturn a profit for the vendor, just cover the operating costs.andP;  She said thefees are minimal and range from $30 to $1,000 semiannually.andM;The RFP does not demand that the new vendor provide electronic access to theparticipating institutions.andP;  Instead, the SEC said it would allow thecontractor to choose a mix of manual and computerized functions.andP;  But fastturnaround is definitely a consideration.andP;  The RFP said the system mustprovide &quot;prompt, accurate and reliable processing of reports and inquiries.&quot;andM;The center now receives mostly paper forms, although a test program allowsinstitutions to submit data electronically using personal computer modems andmagnetic tape, the center manager said.andP;  The SEC plans to approve electronicreporting with the new contract, she said.andM;Once data is in the system, the processing is rapid.andP;  A source said inquirieshave a one second to two second turnaround time.andM;Depending on the turnaround time, a vendor offering electronic access mighthave an edge over systems that require data input via keyboard or documentscanners.andP;  Bidders must include actual data entry and response times in theproposals, the RFP said.andM;The SEC asked that vendors offer systems that can &quot;immediately&quot; enter reportsinto the database and match inquiries against it.andP;  Also, vendors must reviewnew reports against inquiries received over the last 60 days.andM;At minimum, the winning vendor must confirm receipt of reports weekly andinquiries monthly.andP;  The RFP asked that proposals also include a dailyconfirmation option.andM;To track the certificates, the system uses identifiers unique to eachsecurity, based on a numbering process the American Bankers Association'sCommittee on Uniform Security Identification Procedure (CUSIP) developed in1967.andP;  Standard andamp; Poor's Corp. of New York assigns a security a permanentCUSIP number on issuance.andM;The RFP asked vendors to proposed a system that contains not only a databaseof the reported missing securities but a regularly updated CUSIP MasterDirectory as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
