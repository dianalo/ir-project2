Philips reported an unexpected plunge in first-quarterearnings, leading to a frantic sell-off of its shares.   In trading in Amsterdam, the Dutch electronics giant'sshares plunged 11% to 33.60 guilders ($17.77) from 37.80guilders ($20). That drop knocked 1.13 billion guilders($597.9 million) off the company's market capitalization,cutting its total value to 9.3 billion guilders ($4.92billion).</LP><TEXT>   Yesterday, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading,Philips common fell 14.4% to close at $17.125, off $2.875 ashare, on volume of 1.5 million shares.   The results were described as disastrous by severalanalysts and once again threw into question the company'smuch-ballyhooed restructuring and its long-awaited recovery.Many analysts say they question whether Philips can continueto survive in its current sprawling structure, sellingeverything from hair dryers and light bulbs to semiconductorsand medical equipment.   &quot;Despite earlier statements, the company is not at all onthe right track,&quot; said Fabian Koning, a securities salesmanat Bank Mees andamp; Hope in Amsterdam.   Excluding extraordinary items, profit from operationsplummeted to just six million guilders ($3.2 million) from223 million guilders ($118 million) a year earlier. But anextraordinary gain of 330 million guilders lifted net incometo 336 million guilders from 223 million guilders. Theextraordinary gain came from the sale of part of Philips'sdefense electronics operations to Thomson CSF of France.   Philips blamed its problems on high interest rates,fluctuating exchange rates and a world-wide slump in computersales. But it said that continuing problems for the rest ofthe year will make it &quot;very difficult&quot; to meet an earlierforecast of an increase in operating profit from last year's2.29 billion guilders.   &quot;It's a world-wide malaise,&quot; said a Philips spokesman,&quot;It's not specifically a Philips problem.&quot;   In March, when Philips reported its annual results for1989, it reiterated its forecast of an increase in 1990operating profit and gave no indication of pending problems.Philips said that the global spread of its operations makesit difficult to predict the impact of currency fluctuationsand last-minute changes in consumer demand.   But investors have been hurt by such surprises by Philipsin the past. On Oct. 9, 1986, for example, the company'sstock fell 13% after a similar shock. Several analysts saidthey are losing patience with the company's explanations ofsuch events.   &quot;Visibility has been extremely poor,&quot; said Eleanor Buss,an analyst at Robert Fleming Securities of London. &quot;You wouldthink a company would know what effect currencies would haveon its results.&quot;   Philips, which reports its results in the strong Dutchguilder, has been hurt by weakness in the yen, the dollar andthe pound, the principal currencies used by its competitors.That means that it has been forced to charge higher pricesthan its rivals. High inflation in Brazil and other parts ofLatin America also hurt profits in an important market foritems such as light bulbs and television sets.   But outsiders contend the problem goes beyond currencyfluctuations. &quot;In general,&quot; said one Amsterdam analyst, &quot;theyhave been losing market share in very competitive markets.&quot;   This was especially true in the computer sector, in whichPhilips is a major producer of terminal hardware and personalcomputers.   Nevertheless, Philips said that operating profit rose&quot;substantially&quot; in consumer products, which includes consumerelectronics, domestic appliances, musical recordings andpersonal-care products. It didn't give any profit figures butsaid sales in this sector rose more than 10%.   But even in traditional cash-generating parts of thecompany, such as light bulbs and television-picture tubes,analysts said that Philips is increasingly suffering fromlower margins and stronger competition.   Philips has been undergoing a wrenching restructuringprogram, trying to focus on its leading products and toreduce its work force.   During the past five years, Philips has closed more than75 factories and has cut the number of its employees by morethan 40,000. And since Jan. 1, Philips has further reducedits work force by 3,300 to about 300,000.   Most recently, Philips has confirmed that it's discussinga possible cooperation pact with other computer makers,including Italy's Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. Philips wants toretain a foothold in the computer business to keep as wide apresence as possible to benefit from its expertise from suchareas as high-definition television and in compact disks.   Management consultants and analysts said that yesterday'spoor results will force Philips to redouble its efforts tofind a compatible partner.   Few analysts advised investors to sell their shares at thecurrent depressed levels. One said he expects the share priceto stabilize at near the current level, mainly because oftakeover speculation. The company is currently valued at lessthan half its net asset value and could be sold off for asubstantially higher price if it were broken up, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
