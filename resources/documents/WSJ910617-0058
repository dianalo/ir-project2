Mr. Paisley, who supervised Navy procurement during theheyday of President Reagan's defense buildup, pleaded guiltyto accepting bribes in exchange for providing Unisys Corp.and Martin Marietta Corp. contracts on four separate weaponsprograms valued at more than $3.3 billion.</LP><TEXT>   The former Navy assistant secretary also admitted onFriday that he stole sensitive bid-related information whenhe left the Pentagon in 1987 and then used the data almostimmediately to help United Technologies Corp.'s Pratt andamp;Whitney unit obtain more than $100 million in jet engineorders.   Not only is Mr. Paisley the most senior official convictedin the nationwide probe, but documents filed with his guiltyplea in Alexandria, Va., federal court offer the mostcomprehensive account so far of how he and a close-knit groupof consultants, corporate executives and other Pentagoninsiders conspired to methodically rig purchasing decisionsin the late 1980s through &quot;fraud, bribery {and} conflicts ofinterest.&quot;   Mr. Paisley has agreed to start cooperating withprosecutors, who are expected to begin interviewing him thisweek about contacts with top managers at various defensefirms while at the Navy and later as a high-priced industryconsultant. For more than two years, Mr. Paisley and hislawyer maintained that he didn't violate any laws. Governmentofficials said that the plea agreement was negotiated just afew hours before prosecutors intended to seek an indictment.   Mr. Paisley &quot;dealt at a different level&quot; than the spate ofother Pentagon procurement officials and industry middlemenpreviously convicted in the scandal, said Assistant U.S.Attorney Joseph Aronica, the chief prosecutor. &quot;We arecertainly interested in higher levels of corporateindividuals.&quot;   A major focus of the grand jury inquiry is now expected toshift to retired Martin Marietta Chairman Thomas Pownall, whodealt directly with Mr. Paisley on a top secret, $500 millionNavy program mentioned in the charges, according toinvestigators and lawyers familiar with the case. While thecourt documents filed with the plea don't identify Mr.Pownall by name, they contain repeated and detailedreferences to &quot;a high corporate official of Martin Marietta(now retired).&quot; The government alleges that the officialsecretly provided Mr. Paisley with $3,000 to repair a househe owned in Washington state and agreed to work with one ofMr. Paisley's consulting firms as a subcontractor on theclassified Navy program.   Mr. Pownall, who stepped down as chairman in 1988 as partof a planned retirement and whose name hadn't been personallylinked to any aspect of the investigation, couldn't bereached to comment. A woman who answered the switchboardyesterday at the offices of Schwalb Donnenfeld Bray andamp;Silbert, the Washington law firm representing him, said shewasn't authorized to comment.   An excerpt from a July 1987 conversation secretly taped byfederal investigators quotes consultant William Galvin, oneof Mr. Paisley's closest associates and a Martin Mariettaconsultant, boasting that, in addition to the classified Navywork, the two worked together to steer several other programsto Martin Marietta. &quot;All these programs that you're involvedin,&quot; Mr. Galvin said he told the company, &quot;somebody put youonto.&quot;   The court documents also indicate that Mr. Galvin,previously convicted for his role in bribery andinfluence-peddling, schemed with Mr. Paisley to pocket asmuch as $5 million from selling a consulting business toMartin Marietta. The Bethesda, Md., military contractorwasn't charged with any crimes, though the 89-page documentcharging Mr. Paisley is filled with references to itsdealings with Messrs. Paisley and Galvin over the years.   A Martin Marietta spokesman said &quot;this is a matter betweenthe U.S. attorney and Mr. Paisley,&quot; and said the companydidn't have any other comment.   Mr. Paisley, who received about $500,000 in consultingfees within 15 months after leaving the Pentagon, also wasconvicted of conspiring to share $2 million in kickbacks on apilotless aircraft involving a firm with close ties toIsrael's state-run aircraft company. Though he disputed someof the prosecution's descriptions of his activities, Mr.Paisley acknowledged that if the case had gone to trial hewould have been found guilty.   The next phase of the five-year investigation --code-named &quot;Operation Ill Wind&quot; -- also is expected to focuson Pratt andamp; Whitney and some of its executives, who allegedlyreceived information from Mr. Paisley about its competitors'bid to supply jet engines to the Navy. One Pratt andamp; Whitneyexecutive, according to the documents, was taped thanking Mr.Paisley for the illicit information and passing on theappreciation of a &quot;senior {United Technologies} official&quot; whowas &quot;pleased with the numbers.&quot;   Pratt andamp; Whitney officials couldn't be reached to commentover the weekend. But throughout the investigation, Pratt andamp;Whitney has maintained that it didn't violate any laws andthat its executives had a legitimate right to the informationabout the competition's prices.</TEXT></DOC>
