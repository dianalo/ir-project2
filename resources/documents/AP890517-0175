Reports said themutineers control a key northern city.   The defense minister was slain by rebel soldiers in the revolt,which began Tuesday, and troops killed two rebellious generals,according to government sources and state radio. The total numberof dead was not known.   Government sources said the rebellious generals were among fivecoup leaders and that soldiers and police hunted for the otherthree.   After a pitched tank and artillery battle on the outskirts andfirefights in town Wednesday, Addis Ababa appeared calm and undercontrol of the Marxist government of President Mengistu HaileMariam _ the Soviet Union's strongest ally in Africa.   Reports from the war-torn north, however, indicate thousands ofsoldiers there support the coup bid and have control of Asmara,Ethiopia's second- largest city. They were broadcasting messagesdeclaring the coup a success on a frequency normally used by thegovernment radio station there.   Addis Ababa Radio repeatedly reported the revolt was crushed.   ``In Addis itself, it's increasingly looking like a failed coup,but it appears to be a very different story in other parts of thecountry and especially in the north,'' said a Western diplomat, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   In Washington, State Department deputy spokesman Richard Boucherdescribed the situation in Ethiopia as ``fluid and uncertain.''   He said it was not clear if the coup had been put down and citedreports Wednesdsay that fighting has broken out again amongmilitary units in Addis Ababa.   Mengistu, who has ruled this strategic Horn of Africa nation for15 years, cut short a state visit to communist East Germany andarrived home Wednesday, Addis Ababa radio said. He was met by PrimeMinister Fikre Selassie Wogderes and Vice President Fiseha Desta,it said.   The airport has been closed since Tuesday, in addition to thecapital's schools, businesses and shops. State radio urgedresidents to stay home.   Air traffic controllers Wednesday advised commercial and privatepilots of the danger of being shot down by dissident troops overAsmara, capital of secessionist-minded Eritrea Province.   Asmara is headquarters of Ethiopia's 2nd Army _ 150,000 soldiersthat diplomats and rebels believe support the coup.   The Western diplomat in Addis Ababa said it was not knownwhether the army has handed its arms to the secessionist EritreanPeople's Liberation Front or whether it was continuing to fight thegovernment on its own.   A spokesman for the Eritrean rebels in Rome said, ``Eritrea isunder the control of (rebellious elements in) the Ethiopian army,they have managed to dominate the situation ... they are fightingthe regime.''   According to reports monitored in London by the BritishBroadcasting Corp., a radio station describing itself as the``Voice of Ethiopia located in Asmara'' said Eritrean rebel forceshad imposed a nighttime curfew on the town.   The BBC also monitored a report on the rebels' ``Voice of theBroad Masses of Eritrea'' that quoted Asmara radio as sayingTuesday that Mengistu had been ousted.   The capital's residents awoke to sounds of a heavy tank andartillery battle at a military compound on the outskirts.   ``It was thunderous,'' said the diplomat. ``You could feelbuildings shaking here in the city.   ``After that, things calmed down for a while, but then therewere several fairly severe firefights around town,'' he said.``What we think was happening is that loyal troops were flushingout insurgents who were in hiding.   By midafternoon it was calm, he said. ``But the situation isobviously quite tense and the army is everywhere.''   An African military attache in Addis Ababa said the armygarrison in Harar, eastern Ethiopia, also is supporting coupleaders and that negotiations are under way in Addis Ababa betweenloyalists and dissidents.   ``Things are bad,'' the attache said. ``It is just that they(the government) are not saying.''   Addis Ababa Radio said Maj. Gen. Merid Negusie, the chief ofstaff, and the air force commander, Maj. Gen. Amha Desta, werekilled Tuesday by loyalists.   The station made no mention of Wednesday's fighting.   Government sources said they expect an official announcementsoon of the death of the defense minister, Maj. Gen. Haile GiorgisHabte Mariam.   Government sources said troops are searching for coup plottersthey identified as Industry Minister Fanta Belay, who used tocommand the air force; Aberra Abdualem, chief of operations in theDefense Ministry; and Kumalapchew Dejene, deputy commander of armedforces in Eritrea.   There have been persistent reports of military unrest inEthiopia, especially among field commanders who reportedly believethe government has not supported them adequately in the 28-year-oldnorthern civil war.   The military deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in a coup on Sept.12, 1974. After factional fighting within in the armed forces,Mengistu, then an army major, seized power.   Mengistu inherited the northern insurrections, in which hisforces recently have suffered humiliating defeats.   The Ethiopian army is Africa's best equipped and the continent'slargest, although many of its quarter of a million troops areunwilling conscripts.</TEXT></DOC>
