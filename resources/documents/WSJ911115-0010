American longevity has grown steadily over the decades.The average life expectancy for newborns has risen to 75years today from 47 in 1900. Early in the century, gains camefrom reducing deaths in birth-giving and infancy, while muchof the recent increase has come from reducing heart attacks,strokes and other midlife killers. These gains dwarf theimpact of AIDS, pollution and other modern perils.   As longevity improvements continue, doctors, biologists,demographers and other experts increasingly argue about howlong the trend can persist.   One group sees virtually no upper biological limit. DukeUniversity demographer Kenneth Manton cites extra-long lifespans among Mormons, Seventh Day Adventists, and other groupswith particularly healthy life styles (no drinking or smokingand balanced diets). He says current anti-smoking crusades,new emphasis on exercise and healthy eating, and medicalbreakthroughs could push life expectancy to 100 years orbeyond, conceivably within 30 to 50 years. Previous estimatesof low limits &quot;have often been surpassed within 10 or 15years of being made,&quot; he says.   Other specialists argue that small gains may continue, butthat any major increase is highly unlikely. Dr. Jay Olshanskyand colleagues at the University of Chicago Medical Centercalculate that for average life expectancy to increase to 85,death rates would have to drop by more than half at everyage. Eliminating cancer, they figure, would add only 3.3years to average life expectancy. &quot;The natural degenerationof the body puts a cap of about 85 years on the average ageof death,&quot; they say.   But even small continued gains would have a major policyimpact. More very old people would put a heavier burden onthe working-age population and bring higher national outlayson medical and other care.                                                                                                          Joint Custody's Success   Depends on the Parents                                                                                                          JOINT custody arrangements aren't always as bad as they'vebeen painted, a Stanford University project finds.   Studies of children of divorced parents have often arguedthat joint custody puts heavy psychological burdens on thekids as they feel caught in conflicting loyalties to the twoparents. Stanford University researchers interviewed across-section of more than 500 San Francisco Bay areachildren between the ages of 10 and 18 approximately 4 1/2years after their parents' separations.   The findings: If the divorced parents aren't in conflict-- if they tend to communicate and cooperate amicably witheach other -- the children generally function as well as orbetter than adolescents living primarily with one parent.   But if the parents are at war -- if, for example, oneparent uses the child to carry messages or spy on the otherparent -- the adolescents often do indeed feel caught in themiddle. Then they are more likely to be anxious or depressed,cut classes, and smoke, drink or display behavior problems.   &quot;The biggest predictor of feeling caught between parents,&quot;says psychologist Christy Buchanan, &quot;was having parents whowere in a high degree of conflict.&quot; The proportion of parentsin conflict was about the same as that of parentscooperating, she adds.                                                                                                          Hard Knocks Get in Way   Of Continuing Education                                                                                                          ADULT education is used least by those who might benefitthe most, a government survey says.   People with jobs were twice as likely to be involved inpart-time educational activities during 1990 as those whowere unemployed, and three times as likely as those out ofthe labor force altogether, according to the Department ofEducation's National Center for Education Statistics.   In part, this was due to the fact that adult education wasdefined to include courses provided by employers orprofessional organizations as well as those at colleges,vocational schools or community groups.   Anywhere from one-third to one-half of men and women inhouseholds with annual incomes of $30,000 or more were takingsome course work, compared with one-quarter or fewer ofpeople from households with incomes under $25,000.Participation rates for those with a college degree or somecollege ranged from 39% to 52%, while those with no more thana high school education participated at rates from 7% to 22%.   Men and women were engaged in adult education in about thesame proportions, but the rate was substantially higher forwhites than for blacks or Hispanics. Professionals,executives, administrators, managers and highly trainedtechnicians were far more likely to be involved in part-timeschooling than those in other occupations.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          OVER-DOCTORED? Maryland, Massachusetts and New York rankfirst, second and third among the 50 states in the number ofphysicians per 100,000 population, according to the CensusBureau's 1991 Stastistical Abstract. If the District ofColumbia had been included, it would have ranked first. . . .Foreign students come to U.S. colleges and universities inever-increasing numbers, the Institute of InternationalEducation says. A record 407,500 foreign students werestudying here in the 1990-91 academic year, 5.3% more than inthe previous year. For the second consecutive year, businesswas the most popular area of study, with engineering, theprevious first choice, in second place. Asians accounted formore than half of the total.</TEXT></DOC>
