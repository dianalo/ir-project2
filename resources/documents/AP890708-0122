She was 66.   The precise nature of Sheila McCarthy's cancer was not disclosedin a statement issued by her doctors. Her husband, Patrick, was ather bedside when she died at Addenbrookes hospital, the statementsaid.   The couple's 32-year-old son John, a television journalist, wasriding in a taxi to Beirut's airport to catch a London flight whenhe was kidnapped by gunmen on April 17, 1986.   Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe said Mrs. McCarthy's was ``areminder to us all of the human tragedy of the kidnapping and thesheer heartlessness of the kidnappers who ignored the family'sappeal to let Mrs. McCarthy see her son again before she died.''   Mrs. McCarthy, in a statement issued June 21, appealed to herson's abductors to set him free.   It was relayed through her doctor, Terence Wheeler, who said atthe time: ``As Mrs. McCarthy's personal doctor, I appeal to thoseholding John in the name of humanity, for which Islam is well known,to show compassion and release John to his dying mother.''   There was no response from the kidnappers. The statement followeda similar appeal by Patrick McCarthy that was published in severalBeirut newspapers.   In addition to McCarthy, 16 Westerners are still missing inLebanon. They include American journalist Terry Anderson, thelongest-held foreign captive. Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press, was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   No group has claimed responsibility for McCarthy's abduction,which came amid a wave of kidnappings of foreigners by pro-IranianShiite Moslem zealots.   McCarthy, employed by the London-based Worldwide Television News,was seized two days after U.S. warplanes bombed Libyan targets inretaliation for terrorist acts the United States alleged weresponsored by Libya.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government allowed U.S.warplanes to fly from bases in Britain for the attacks. The raidscaused widespread anger against the United States and Britain inMoslem countries.</TEXT></DOC>
