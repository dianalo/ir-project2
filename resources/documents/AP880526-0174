(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Shoreham nuclear power plant, long aburden to Long Island Lighting Co., will be taken over by the stateand torn down under an agreement reached Thursday by stateofficials and the utility.   If the agreement, which is subject to many conditions, goesthrough, it would be the first time a completed nuclear power plantwas abandoned before it opened.   The deal calling for LILCO to sell the $5.3 billion plant to thestate for $1 was a victory for opponents of the facility 55 mileseast of Manhattan on the north shore of Long Island.   At a news conference Thursday, Gov. Mario Cuomo said the plantshould be torn down, rather than mothballed, to prevent itsresurrection.   ``That would be very much like taking a loaded rifle and storingit in the closet,'' said Cuomo. ``Maybe someday that NRA (NationalRifle Association) will take over and then we can use it.''   U.S. Rep. George Hochbrueckner, whose district includes theplant, agreed. ``We've shown Shoreham the cross, but we have to puta stake through its heart,'' he said.   While Cuomo said a few details remain to be worked out, heinsisted, ``We have gotten everything we wanted.''   ``Shoreham has to die, Shoreham will die,'' he said.   The Shoreham project, begun in 1965, ended up 10 years behindschedule and more than 80 times as expensive as originallypredicted, driving LILCO to the edge of bankruptcy.   Completed in 1984, it never went into service because of therefusal by state and local officials to participate in emergencyevacuation planning. They argued that Long Island, because of itsgeography, could not be safely evacuated during a nuclear accident.   The densely populated, narrow island, with about 2.5 millionresidents outside of New York City, extends eastward about 120miles from Manhattan. In the event of an evacuation, residentswould have to leave either by boat or head westward.   Without such a plan, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission refusedto issue anything more than a low-power testing license forShoreham.   State efforts to close Shoreham accelerated after the NRC inOctober eliminated the rule requiring state and local governmentparticipation in an evacuation plan. The state had been proceedingwith a possible takeover of the company, and Cuomo had set amidnight Wednesday deadline for the conclusion of negotiations.   The announcement of a tentative agreement between the state andLILCO came about 1{ hours after that deadline.   For LILCO, the settlement would allow it to continue to operateas a privately owned utility.   The entire agreement must be approved by the state PublicService Commission, and some parts of it need the Legislature'sapproval. New generating plants would then be built on Long Islandto ensure an adequate supply of electricity.   The deal also is subject to LILCO being able to obtain aninvestment rating that will allow it to refinance $2 billion of itsdebt at lower interest rates.   And any decommissioning plan would be subject to NRC approval,said agency spokesman Frank Ingram. While that could give the NRCthe ability to block the dismantling, Cuomo spokesman Gary Fryersaid he felt the NRC would consider only safety issues in ruling onplans to raze the plant.   Under the tentative agreement, LILCO would pay fordecommissioning, which could cost $500 million, said Cuomo aides.But the utility would be allowed to raise its electric rates by 5percent annually for the next three years, and rate increases of 5percent annually would be the target for the following seven years.   LILCO's nearly 1 million customers pay the second-highestelectric rates in the country, second only to neighboringConsolidated Edison in the New York City area.   The governor said the agreement, if finalized, would have nonegative impact on rates for customers of other utilities in thestate.   The settlement calls for action by the Public Service Commissionon the rate structure issue within 90 days of the proposal's filingwith it, expected in a few days. During the 90-day period, LILCOagreed not to turn up the power at Shoreham even in the unlikelyevent that it obtained the 25 percent power operating license ithad been seeking from the NRC.   Cuomo has called LILCO's management ``arrogant and cynical,''and insisted on company reforms. But he said Thursday that LILCOand the state had yet to work out exactly what they would be. Hesaid it might be good if LILCO Chairman William Catacosinosremained ``for the time being.''   In addition to the tentative settlement with the state, LILCO isalso trying to negotiate an end to a $8.7 billion racketeering casefiled against the utility by Suffolk County officials andindividual homeowners.</TEXT></DOC>
