Announces First Version@  Of Computer Operating-System Software@  ----@  By G.

Next Inc., Mr. Jobs's closely held company, has finished the first version of its operating-system software, marking the completion of a computer it unveiled eleven months ago. &quot;This is going to make Next look good again,&quot; said Ron Johnson, associate vice president for computing and communications at the University of Washington.    The completion of the operating-system software, which controls the computer's basic functions, represents an important milestone for Next. The company plans to rely heavily on sales to universities, so it was considered critical that Next have a finished product ready this month when students and faculty begin a new academic year. Next has been shipping its computer since the spring with a test version of the operating system, but many universities have advised students and faculty not to buy the machine until the software was completed.    Completing the operating system also may quiet critics who claim the computer -- dubbed &quot;Eventually&quot; by some skeptics -- hadn't lived up to expectations. Mr. Jobs, a co-founder of Apple Computer Inc., has already made good on his promise to build a computer that blends together advanced graphics, sound and other &quot;hardware&quot; technologies. While these novel devices captured much attention, Mr. Jobs acknowledged that creating the computer's basic software posed a greater challenge.    Next's software has many of the same general features -- icons, pull-down menus, windows and desktop imagery -- that are credited with fueling the popularity of Apple's Macintosh computer, whose design Mr. Jobs oversaw in the early 1980s. Next's software, however, is written in a variant of Unix, a computer language widely used by engineers and scientists. While Unix is more powerful than DOS, the standard language for personal-computer programs, it is more complex and doesn't yet offer many applications popular with users of personal computers, such as spreadsheets and databases.    A delay of several months in completing the system software increased the pressure on Next; those who used the test versions of the software complained that the machine was slow and that it frequently &quot;crashed&quot; because of programming glitches. Mr. Jobs himself even crashed the computer during a public demonstration this summer.    It is common for new software to contain errors, or &quot;bugs,&quot; and many companies fall months behind in making the needed repairs. When they are satisfied with the way a new piece of software works, designers &quot;freeze&quot; the code, designating it version 1.0. In the future, new versions of the software may be released to repair hidden bugs or include new features.    Next plans to begin shipping its finished system software by the week of Sept. 18, a spokeswoman said. She added, however, that Next was still running final tests on version 1.0 and could not rule out the possibility of uncovering serious bugs. That might delay the release of the software, she said.    Next already has begun distributing the operating system to outside software developers and others. Users say the completed version is a vast improvement over earlier test versions.    &quot;We've been pounding on it since last week, and so far there haven't been any bugs,&quot; said Bill Edwards, a group leader at Frame Technology Corp., a San Jose software company that has developed a desktop publishing application for Next's computer.    Mr. Edwards said version 1.0 incorporates a variety of repairs to earlier test software that together substantially increase the computer's speed. It solves, for instance, one vexing problem: When unconnected to other computers, Next's computer sometimes acted as if these connections existed, needlessly slowing the machine down.    The completion of Next's software gives the company a chance to unleash a fresh assault on its competition. In anticipation of this, Mr. Jobs took over direct control of the company's marketing efforts in July and this fall plans to highlight his computer's capacity to produce print-shop-quality documents.    &quot;You'll see a big emphasis on workstation publishing,&quot; said Tom Clements, national sales manager for Businessland Inc., which is selling Next computers to non-university buyers. Mr. Clements said a new program by Frame Technologies &quot;makes the benefits of Next really reach up out at you.&quot;    Part of the reason Next will put its emphasis on publishing is that until outsiders write more software for the machine there are few other general uses for it. One obvious need: a spreadsheet. Even professors, who have bought the machine for applications ranging from music to medical imaging to mathematics, &quot;would like a spreadsheet,&quot; said the University of Washington's Mr. Johnson, &quot;so they could work on their budgets.&quot;    Despite the lack of applications software, Businessland reports that interest in Next's computer among big computer buyers is brisk. &quot;Most have already taken the first step of buying evaluation units and are looking at how this will mesh with their existing computers,&quot; Mr. Clements said. Businessland sells the Next machine for $10,000. The price through a university is about $6,500. Both prices include eight megabytes of internal memory, a 17-inch monitor, Motorola Inc.'s 68030 central processor and word-processing software. </TEXT></DOC>
