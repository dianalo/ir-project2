<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-53-0324 </DOCNO><TEXT>A new derivation of the first two coefficients of the heat kernel expansionfor a second-order elliptic differential operator on a Riemann-Cartanmanifold with arbitrary torsion is given. The expressions are presentedin a very compact and tractable form useful for physical applications.Comparisons with other similar results that appeared in the literatureare briefly discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
