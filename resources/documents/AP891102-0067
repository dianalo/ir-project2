During the 10-week campaign, 340 businessmen and governmentofficials in Beijing confessed to embezzlement, taking bribes andother economic crimes involving a total of $1 million, reported theBeijing Daily. About $389,000 was returned, it said.   In Shanghai, China's largest city and major industrial center,1,175 people had surrendered to authorities by Monday, admittingthey illegally received $2.08 million in Chinese cash. About halfof that was returned, according to the local newspaper Wen Hui Bao.   Among those who confessed in Shanghai were factory bosses,managers and mid-level officials of various enterprises, the WenHui said.   News reports did not say how many Chinese confessed in othercities during the nationwide campaign. It was the latest effort inChina's drive to root out corruption and white-collar crime whichhave spread rapidly under the economic liberalizations of the lastdecade.   The Supreme People's Court and Supreme People's Prosecutor'soffice announced on Aug. 15 that all people who turned themselvesin to authorities for economic crimes by Oct. 31 would be treatedleniently.   The government has stepped up anti-corruption crackdowns sincethe pro-democracy demonstrations earlier this year. Endingcorruption was a popular demand among students, workers and otherresidents who filled Tiananmen Square and the streets of Beijingduring the protests, which were violently suppressed by the Chinesearmy in early June.   Also today, the Communist Party said that despite weeks ofideological indoctrination, some Chinese college students still``have knots to be untied'' because they believe theirpro-democracy protests this past spring were patriotic.   Commentaries in two major newspapers, including the main partypaper People's Daily, also called on students and intellectuals toembrace socialism and the party's leadership, or their aspirationswill ``vanish like soap bubbles.''   As part of its program to stem a resurgence of the movement onBeijing's university campuses, authorities required a month ofpolitical study of all students before the beginning of the fallsemester.   The bloody suppression of the protests in June by the Chinesearmy left at least hundreds of unarmed civilians dead. Since thenthe government has insisted that the protests were misled by aclique of ``counter-revolutionaries'' seeking to topple thecountry's communist leadership.</TEXT></DOC>
