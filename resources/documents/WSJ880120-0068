AMI Healthcare Group PLC will own all of the parent's U.K. operations, including 13 general hospitals and three psychiatric hospitals. In the year ended Aug. 31, the operations contributed revenue of $169 million, or about 6%, of American Medical's total revenue of $2.7 billion. American Medical is based in Beverly Hills, Calif.    The timing and size of any minority-stake sale depends on market conditions, said an American Medical spokesman. Proceeds of any sale would be used, along with cash from American Medical operations, to finance the $400 million debt reduction and stock buy-back plan announced by the hospital company in October.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, American Medical shares closed at $12.25, down 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
