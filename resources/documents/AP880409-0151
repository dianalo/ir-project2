Guillermo Garcia, 34, of Havana went home Thursday without themoney because of the enforcement of a provision of the Trading Withthe Enemy Act of 1917, The New York Times reported in its Sundayeditions.   Quoting an unidentified Treasury Department spokesman, the Timessaid the sanctions against Cuba were put into effect by PresidentKennedy in 1963.   ``It's very unfortunate and it saddens me,'' Garcia told thenewspaper before boarding a plane home after competing in the$125,000 New York Open, which ended March 30.   ``This is something that I never heard happen before in thehistory of chess, where a grandmaster wins a prize and he can'treceive it,'' said Garcia, one of about 250 grandmasters in theworld and Cuba's national champion three times. He was second-placewinner in the New York City tournament.   He said he believes ``politics should not intrude on sportsactivities.''   Lawyer Harold A. Mayerson is exploring the possibility of suingthe Treasury Department, the Times said.   Mayerson said the law probably wasn't meant to be applied incases like Garcia's. ``And if it was, it carried a questionablepolicy, the blockade of Cuba, to a ludicrous conclusion,'' he added.   The Treasury Department spokesman said the $10,000 Garcia wonwill go into an interest-bearing account in his name in the UnitedStates.   But an official of the Treasury Department's Office of ForeignAssets Control said the account will be blocked so that he can haveaccess to it only if he establishes permanent residence in acountry other than Cuba, Libya, Vietnam, North Korea and Cambodia,the nations the law applies to, the Times said.   The official, who also was not identified, said the sanction is``to prevent transfer of hard currency to Cuba and to provideleverage to reach a settlement with Cuba because of theirexpropriation of U.S. property back in the early 1960s.''</TEXT></DOC>
