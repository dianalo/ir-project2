At the time of the Feb. 25 attack, which killed 28Americans and wounded another 100, Brig. Gen. Richard Neal, aspokesman for U.S. central command, blamed the disaster onthe Scud's disintegration in the atmosphere. &quot;This particularcase, because it went into a tumble . . . it wasn't withinthe parameters of where it would be attacked by our missiledefense system,&quot; Gen. Neal said.</LP><TEXT>   But now U.S. officials acknowledge that nearly every Scudbroke up during descent, making the barracks attack routinerather than unusual. Moreover, Col. Bruce Garnett, the Army'sPatriot program manager, says the Scud was within the15-mile-wide circle defended by Patriot batteries in Dhahran.The Patriots should have shot at the warhead, he says, butdidn't because of an &quot;operational matter&quot; he won't discuss.   Back in Saudi Arabia, central command is putting the finaltouches on a report on the disaster -- the costliestengagement of the war for the U.S. One of two Patriotbatteries within range of the Scud was down for repairs, aCentral Command spokesman says.
