As of yesterday they were still holding up the big ratification vote, but did manage to clobber resisting Republicans and White House Chief of Staff Howard Baker in a 72-27 vote in favor of a provision involving how treaties are interpreted. The Democrats' effort will stand as simply one more offensive in Congress's search-and-destroy mission against the vestiges of what was once executive-branch authority over foreign policy.    The current scheme is political blackmail: Bleed President Reagan of the presidency's treaty authority in exchange for the favor of ratifying INF while he's in Moscow for the summit. This provision would completely reverse the constitutional separation of powers over treaties by giving the Senate final word over what treaties mean. By diluting the President's power to interpret and execute the law of the land, including treaties, the INF provision would clearly violate the Constitution.    The provision says that treaties must be interpreted as the &quot;common understanding of the treaty shared by the President and the Senate at the time the Senate gives its advice and consent to ratification.&quot; This language was based on a Foreign Relations Committee INF report, which concocted the reinterpretation clause. The report defined &quot;understanding&quot; as the text of the treaty plus the &quot;authoritative representations&quot; -- whatever that means -- of administration officials during ratification hearings. Even more ambiguous, there's a reference to &quot;implicit understandings,&quot; defined as when executive officials' &quot;statements are made and there is general acceptance of their tenor&quot; by Senators. The provision also says that any future interpretation that differs from Senate testimony &quot;cannot be adopted without the approval of the Senate.&quot;    But the President is supposed to have total authority for treaties, from negotiating them to interpreting their meaning, with the large exception that the Senate has complete veto power simply by withholding its two-thirds consent. This makes sense. By their nature, treaties require one and only one negotiator on each side. As the Supreme Court cautioned last year, &quot;in interpreting an international treaty, we are mindful that it is in the nature of a contract between nations.&quot;    The Senate Democrats' provision reflects a disconnection from the way the world actually works. As Senator Arlen Specter told his colleagues last week, boosters of this provision have the conceit that for treaties the &quot;paramount consideration is what was agreed upon between the President of the U.S. and the Senate.&quot; A President would have to negotiate first with the Soviets, then bargain with the Senators. But surely the Senate's position would restrict only the U.S., not a determined adversary.    The illegitimacy of this creation is shown in the Democrats' struggle to name it. They didn't want to call it an &quot;amendment,&quot; &quot;reservation&quot; or &quot;understanding,&quot; probably because most legal experts agree that the Soviets would then have to be consulted and explicitly consent. It could have been a &quot;declaration,&quot; but Presidents would easily ignore any such general policy guides. So the Democrats settled on &quot;condition,&quot; a novel and perhaps meaningless phrase in the context of treaties.    More incredible still, the provision has little if anything to do with the INF treaty itself. It is targeted at space testing of SDI technologies. Its purpose is to give Sam Nunn ammunition in his legal battle with with Abe Sofaer, the State Department lawyer, over the broad vs. narrow view of the old ABM treaty. The provision is written to be retroactive, so that it would cover ABM, in accordance with Sam Nunn's desires.    No doubt the high-minded proponents of this ploy see it as the routine exercise of their senatorial prerogatives. Indeed it is, if viewed in terms of the Senators' recent habit of turning federal laws into their personal baggage carts. Perhaps the Senators should use the INF treaty to display the courage of their conditions: Throw in money for religious schools in France, comprehensive health coverage, a ban on program trading and a plant-closing provision.    Some President will have to resist these encroachments. Perhaps when the document reaches Mr. Reagan he ought to follow through on advice President Nixon got on the War Powers Resolution. Mr. Reagan should detach the &quot;condition&quot; from the treaty, hold it up to the cameras and say: &quot;I want to thank the Senate for this interesting essay on my constitutional powers. When I return, I will send them a personal essay of my own on the same subject.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
