After an innovative 20-year careerin business, Warren embarked in 1975 on a second career aseconomic journalist and cold-eyed iconoclast.   His columns in the Boston Herald touched off a successfultax revolt in Massachusetts, the seat of high-tax liberalism.In 1985, he joined the Detroit News and began an influentialsyndicated column. While a master in using statistics toexpose economic fallacies, he never forgot that economics isfirst and foremost about people and the incentives they face.</LP><TEXT>   In his later years, Warren became the major scourge ofenvironmental extremists and wrote path-breaking articlesdebunking acid rain, the Clean Air Act and global warming --the voguish causes of the day.   Few voices stand as Warren Brookes did, shouting factsinto the gale of fashion. He will not be easily replaced, andwill surely be missed.</TEXT></DOC>
