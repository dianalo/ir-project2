To pursue the problem,the Dynamics Explorer 2 (DE 2) ionospheric electron density irregularitydata obtained at approximately 800-km altitude in the winter polar capduring sunspot maximum conditions were utilized. During this period anall-sky imaging photometer located at Thule, Greenland, within the polarcap, detected the presence of convecting ionization patches, and polarbeacon satellite measurements detected several discrete, intense scintillationstructures associated with these patches (E. J. Weber et al., 1984).The electron-density deviation (delta N) obtained by combining irregularityamplitudes (delta N/N)rms processed over 8-s intervals and the in-situdensity (N) data acquired by the DE 2 satellite also showed the presenceof spatially discrete structures. These irregularity structures, bothin N and delta N, had spatial extents of approx. 1000 km in the N-S direction.The density associated with these structures, even at 800 km, showeda twofold to threefold to increase in comparison to the background, andirregularity amplitudes (delta N/N)rms as large as 20% were observedat the edges of the patches.</TEXT></DOC>
