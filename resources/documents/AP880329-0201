KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee voted12-6 Tuesday to approve a measure intended to bar future presidentsfrom changing the current U.S. view of the meaning of themedium-range missile treaty with the Soviet Union.   Rep. Daniel Evans, R-Wash., called the action ``a gratuitousslap'' at President Reagan and said it might cause him and otherGOP treaty supporters to vote against the pact.   In a separate development, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairmanof the Foreign Relations panel, said another treaty problem hasbeen solved with administration assurances that the pact does banmedium-range weapons based on such futuristic or exotic technologyas laser rays and particle beam generators.   The Senate Armed Services Committee had identified the issue offutristic weapons as one which had to be fully settled before thefull Senate acted on the pact.   Earlier Tuesday, the Senate met in unusual secret session toreview conflicting intelligence estimates on the size of the Sovietmedium-range SS-20 missile force.   But conservatives who called for the meeting to air claims thatthe Soviets are hiding a large force of SS-20s, said few if anyminds had been changed about the merits of the new treatyeliminating such nuclear weapons.   The partisan dispute in the Foreign Relations Committee over themeaning of treaty language stems from the controversy thatdeveloped after the Reagan administration asserted in 1986 that anew reading of the negotiating record of the 1972 Anti-ballisticMissile or ABM Treaty permitted the deployment of a ``Star Wars''strategic defense system despite the widely held view that the pactbanned ``exotic'' missile-defense systems.   The Democratic sponsors of the language added by the committeeto the treaty said it would block future presidents from changingthe meaning of the pact on grounds that the Senate had not beenfully informed about the contents of the negotiating record or hadotherwise been misled.   Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., an outspoken opponent of the INF pact,unexpectedly voted for the measure after Sen. Alan Cranston,D-Calif., agreed to add language stating that a commonly acceptedtreaty interpretation cannot be changed except by the Senate'sratification of a subsequent treaty or by enactment of a law byboth houses of Congress.   Sen. Richard Lugar, R-Ind., told reporters later he believedHelms acted out of a ``devious'' strategy intended to prolong thedispute and perhaps to torpedo the treaty itself.   Helms denied that saying that in its previous form the measurehad been unconstitutional.   Lugar also accused the Democratic sponsors of the proposal of``a deliberate bid to embarrass the president,'' adding it iscertain to cause a fierce fight on the Senate floor.   Evans told reporters: ``I think this has made it a partisansituation. It's a gratuitous slap at the president.''   ``No one has worked harder for this treaty than me,'' Evanssaid. ``But now I'm going to seriously take a look as to whether Iwill vote for it on the floor.''   The secret session, the first held by the Senate since October1986, was convened to discuss allegations the Soviets may try tohide a covert force of more than 300 SS-20 medium-range missilesafter the treaty banning such weapons goes into effect.   ``I think they heard some things they hadn't heard before,''said Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., who has long pursued the theory thatthe Soviet SS-20 force is far larger than the 650 missiles theSoviets declare they have.   But Sen. Steven Symms, R-Idaho, told reporters: ``I would besurprised if any minds were changed.''   ``I don't know if it changed any minds,'' said Sen. MalcolmWallop, R-Wyo., when asked to describe the three-hour secretsession held for security reasons in the Old Senate Chamber, lastused on a regular basis in 1859.   ``The treaty has a political life which is in large partindependent of its own terms,'' Wallop said, adding that manysenators fear explosive political results inside the North AtlanticTreaty Organization were the treaty to be denied Senateratification.   ``The inadequacies of this treaty are probably tolerable for amajority who feel that the political consequences in Europe faroutweigh concern about the failures and weaknesses in the treaty,''Wallop said.   Symms said he doubts if more than a dozen or so senators willvote against the INF pact.   But Symms, Wallop and other conservatives said the debate overthe medium-range missile treaty has set the stage for a far moredivisive and uncertain battle over a treaty making deep reductionin intercontionental nuclear arms.   ``INF is the appetizer for the main course, the START treaty,''Symms said.   START, an acronym for Strategic Arms Limitation Talks, would befar more significant militarily and provide far more incentive forthe Soviets to cheat, Symms contended.   The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is scheduled to voteWednesday on whether to send the medium-range missile pact to thefull Senate.   The Senate Armed Services Committee voted 18-2 on Monday torecommend the treaty be approved.   But in doing so it ignited a new controversy, declaring it wasnot clear from the text of the treaty or the negotiating recordwhether the accord covers futuristic, high-technology weapons suchas those using laser rays or particle beam generators.</TEXT></DOC>
