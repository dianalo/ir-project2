Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP CANDA FREST JAPAN </CO><IN> MON PCS CMD FRX </IN><DATELINE> CHICAGO  </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan warned that further declines in the dollar wouldn't do much to help -- and could actually harm -- attempts to reduce the huge U.S. trade deficit.    Referring to himself and central bankers from the other so-called Group of Five industrial countries, Mr. Greenspan said there was &quot;to a greater or lesser extent, general agreement that the adjustment process has made considerable progress in the states.&quot; But the Fed chairman conceded there was disagreement among the G-5 central bankers over &quot;the rate of adjustment in the future and the conditions required to implement that.&quot; The G-5 nations are the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France and Britain.    The comments were made at news conference after a closed-door presentation to top-level executives from about 100 of the world's biggest banks at the International Monetary Conference.    Indicating that export growth was putting pressure on U.S. manufacturing capacity, Mr. Greenspan said the chances of further dollar reductions &quot;inducing a still greater physical volume of adjustment is quite limited in the period immediately ahead.&quot; He added that if the dollar fell further and its effect showed up in higher import prices, it &quot;is likely to augment nominal dollar-denominated U.S. trade deficits rather than implement further progress.&quot;    This implies &quot;that the total international adjustment process . . . is probably going at the pace about as fast as one should want it to go. Clearly, the more rapid adjustment the better, but looking at the various physical constraints, it is probably as close to optimum as one can get -- at least in the short-term,&quot; he said.    Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Banque de France and former chairman of the International Monetary Fund, agreed with Mr. Greenspan and argued that the success of the adjustment process, U.S. price stability and the maintenance of reasonable growth depended on stable exchange rates.    The central bankers didn't delineate their disagreements at the news conference. But European nations and Japan have long argued that the U.S. should do more to reduce its budget deficits, which they believe contribute to relatively strong American economic growth. That, in turn, say economists, plays a major role in the country's continuing hefty appetite for foreign imports.    Mr. Greenspan conceded a reduction in the U.S. budget deficit was &quot;a necessary condition&quot; to continue &quot;the adjustment process over a long term.&quot;    At the same time, the Reagan administration has urged West Germany to take steps to stimulate economic growth and reduce its trade surplus, which would boost Third World exports that overwhelmingly come to the U.S.    At the news conference and in a speech to the Chicago Council on Foreign Relations last night, Karl Otto Poehl, president of West Germany's Bundesbank, offered a vigorous defense of his country's economic policy. Noting that data showed the West German economy expanding at a 6% annual rate and &quot;an unprecedented rise of more than 8% in per capita real income&quot; in the past two years, he said his country was making its contribution to the global adjustment process.    Mr. Poehl warned markets against inferring that the Bundesbank's sale of $2 billion in late May was an attempt to keep the dollar from rising. &quot;These dollar sales have not been interventions in the normal sense to influence the exchange rate,&quot; he said. &quot;This should not be seen in the context of coordinated intervention but as normal commercial transactions,&quot; to reduce the bank's large dollar reserves.    Mr. Poehl implicitly criticized U.S. economic policy. He said that &quot;as regards the financing of the U.S. current account deficits, it is obvious that this has to be done rather through private financing, for which central banks cannot be substitute.&quot;    Moreover, in an apparent rejection of Treasury Secretary James Baker's advocacy of using a commodity-price indicator as a prime tool to judge world inflationary pressures, the Bundesbank president said money supply was &quot;more effective as a leading indicator of inflation than any commodity index.&quot; He called on Group of Seven industrial countries -- the Group of Five plus Italy and Canada -- to &quot;focus also on a monetary indicator.&quot;    Despite the relatively upbeat picture publicly presented by the central bankers, one privately expressed doubts about the stability of current markets. &quot;Everything is all right, calm, but that's what we thought in September and see what happened,&quot; he said, refering to the October stock market crash.    He also questioned the advisability of the G-7 countries restating last December their intention to maintain stable exchange rates. &quot;It would have been better if we didn't have that thing in December; the dollar would probably be down to 1.60 or 1.55 (West German) marks,&quot; he said. &quot;It would be more sustainable; I'm not sure 1.70 (marks) is sustainable.&quot;    One central banker said some monetary officials wanted to let the market take the dollar down further to &quot;its natural level,&quot; after the October crash but that Western politicians resisted that approach. Another said the Reagan administration feared a falling dollar's effects on U.S. bond and equity markets and that European politicians have long been concerned about the falling dollar's negative effects on their companies' industrial competitiveness.    In late afternoon New York trading, the dollar rose to 1.7266 marks from 1.7113 marks late Tuesday. It stood at 125.59 yen, up from 125.48 yen.    In early trading in Tokyo Thursday, the dollar opened at 125.55 yen.    On New York's Commodity Exchange Wednesday, current-delivery gold settled at $456.10 an ounce, down $3.90. Estimated volume was a moderate four million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $454.60 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Wednesday, June 8, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
