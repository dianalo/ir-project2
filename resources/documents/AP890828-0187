JOHN, Jersey (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The realities of modern farming areintruding upon the cosy world of the Channel Islands where men andwomen lovingly raise real Jersey and Guernsey cows.   Today's dairy farmers on the British-crown islands off Francehave become much more competitive, and as they have modernized, theyhave concentrated their cows into a smaller number but larger, moreefficient herds.   That, the farmers say, ultimately is not good for the two famousbreeds.   Still the cows are delicately looked after.   Every evening at about 7 o'clock Philip Romeril goes out to thefield behind his 18th-century farmhouse to check on his 60 Jerseys.   Their golden brown hides glow in the soft, receding summer light.Their tails swish and their round, brown eyes blink. They have nameslike Carol and Marie, and they ooze contentment.   Romeril scratches the tops of a few heads, tugs at a floppy earhere and there, runs his hand over a pregnant cow's bulge.   And then he has a chat with them.   ``People think I'm crazy because I talk to my cows,'' Romerilsaid. ``But it's important. A cow that runs away from you is not ahappy cow.''   Explained Anne Perchard, another Jersey dairy farmer, who servesas chairman of the World Jersey Cattle Bureau, ``There has to be atremendous feeling towards the cow itself, otherwise there areeasier ways of making a living.''   In addition to modernization on dairy farms, young people arebeing lured from the land by the islands' booming financial servicesand tourist industries and that also could endanger the future ofGuernseys and Jerseys.   Other factors also are conspiring against the islands' cowfarmers. Guernsey has lost some 50 cows, and Jersey a handful, tobovine spongiform encepholopathy, or a softening of the braintissues apparently linked to a cow feed.   It is believed that the disease, which has struck in England aswell, is not contagious and isn't passed on to offspring. Butfarmers aren't entirely sure.   Also, the approach of 1992, when the 12-nation European EconomicCommunity dismantles all trade barriers, has raised fears of milkimports.   The islands, which are not members of the community and aredependencies of the British crown, currently are protected from suchimports. On each, the farmers sell their milk to one milk marketingboard.   In an effort to improve their herds, Jersey farmers areconsidering following Guernsey's lead and mating their cows withoutside bulls for the first time in nearly 200 years.   ``The small dairy farmer is struggling to make a living,''Romeril said.   Said farmer William Luff, secretary of World Guernsey CattleFederation, ``The number of farms is being reduced all the time.''   Jersey, the bigger of the two islands, has about 7,000 cows. Theyare smallish and brown, some have white markings. Islanders describetheir faces as dishy.   Guernsey has about 4,000, which have similar coloring, but theytend to be heftier and have Roman noses.   There were about twice as many island cows in the 19th century,when thousands were exported mostly to England, the United States,Canada, New Zealand, Australia and Denmark.   In the old days, the average Jersey herd was made up of a dozenor so cows. Now it has 40.   There are 100 dairy farmers on Jersey, compared with 1,005 in1952. On Guernsey, there are 85 farmers vs. 353 in 1952.   ``Some people say that in 20 years, there will 25 large herdssupplying the island,'' Mrs. Perchard said. ``That would be very sadbecause the whole idea of the island cow in her setting wouldevaporate.''   Romeril said, ``Genetically I think we would suffer because youwould have a lot more concentration on certain blood lines. Eachbull would sire more cows.''   Apart from young people leaving agriculture, there are alsoworries that high property prices will tempt farmers to sell theirland.   ``Perhaps there won't be enough people to maintain the islandherd in 15 years time,'' Guernsey's Luff said.   Jersey's Parliament twice has voted down a proposal to importsemen to improve the herd, and proponents have agreed to wait forthe completion of a five-year genetic study before raising the issueagain.   ``This is the veritable cradle of the breed,'' Mrs. Perchardsaid. ``The fact that we are a closed herd, this is something thatis looked at with envy. But one wonders whether (semen imports)would improve our product.''   Guernsey imported semen in 1976, from an English-bred Guernseybull, and Luff said the Guernsey breed has improved as a result.   Of course, each island thinks its own breed is superior _ arivalry as traditional as the supper time check on cows.   ``We all go around last thing,'' said Peter Lee, a Jersey farmer.``They're all members of the family.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs Sept. 6</NOTE></DOC>
