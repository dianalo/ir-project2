Section 92.11(e) of the regulations requires, with certain exceptions,that each lot of pet birds, commercial birds, zoological birds, or researchbirds imported from any part of the world be entered at certain ports andbe quarantined at one of our quarantine facilities or at a privately operatedquarantine facility approved by the Administrator for the Animal and PlantHealth Inspection Service (APHIS). The quarantine requirements were establishedto help ensure that birds imported into the United States are free fromexotic Newcastle disease, forms of avian influenza lethal to poultry, andother communicable diseases of poultry.Persons associated with the commercial bird industry have requested thatwe establish regulations to allow birds to be imported into the UnitedStates without quarantine in the United States, if the birds are importedfrom a country free of viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease (whichposes the greatest threat to the poultry industry of all communicable diseasesof poultry), from a closed breeding facility containing only birds thatoriginated in the United States and the offspring of those birds. We arenot proposing to establish those regulations.<ITAG tagnum="85">Birds Shipped to the Closed Breeding Facility</ITAG>This proposal includes provisions to ensure that birds brought <T3>into</T3> the closed breeding facility are free of communicable diseasesof poultry upon arrival in the facility. The facility must conain onlybirds that have never previously been in a country other than the UnitedStates, or the offspring of those birds if they were hatched in the facility.The facility must contain no birds that were at any time removed from thefacility. In order to ensure that the birds are free of communicable diseasesof poultry at the time of shipment, we are proposing to require that acertificate issued by an accredited veterinarian and endorsed by a veterinarianemployed by APHIS accompany each shipment of birds from the United Statesto the closed breeding facility. In addition to information identifyingthe birds, the certificate would have to contain information indicatingthat all birds in the shipment were inspected by an accredited veterinarian,and that no evidence of any communicable diseases of poultry was foundamong the birds. The certificate would also have to indicate that the birdswere not subjected to any bacterial or viral agent known to cause a communicabledisease of poultry during the 90 days immediately before their exportationfrom the United States; that the birds were placed in previously unusedcontainers at the premises from which they were exported from the UnitedStates; and that the birds have not been vaccinated, unless the vaccinehas been approved by the Administrator. We would include criteria for theapproval of vaccines and a footnote (footnote 7) indicating where to writeto request a list of approved vaccines. Additionally, we would acquirethat the certificate indicate that during the 90 days immediately beforeexportation of the birds from the United States, Newcastle disease didnot occur anywhere on the premises from which the birds are to be exportedfrom the United States or on adjoining premises, and that none of the abovepremises are located in an area that has been under quarantine for poultrydiseases at any time during the 90 days immediately before exportationof the birds from the United States. The 90-day provisions would ensurethat any disease that the birds might have been exposed to before thattime would manifest itself before shipment of the birds from the UnitedStates.In order to ensure that the birds do not become infected with communicablediseases of poultry during shipment, we would require that the birds beshipped by air, without stopping, from the United States to the countryin which the closed breeding facility is located. Upon arrival of the birdsin the country in question, a salaried veterinarian of that country's nationalveterinary services would have to accompany the birds to the facility.Identification of the birds would have to be maintained during shipmentby means of a serially numbered legband, coded to the facility, that wouldhave to be applied before shipment of the birds from the United States.The Legbands would have to be shipped by the operator of the closed breedingfacility, and would have to be individually identifiable closed legbands.<ITAG tagnum="85">Conditions for Approval of Closed Breeding Facility</ITAG>To qualify for approval by the Administrator of APHIS (referred to belowas the Administrator), a closed breeding facility and its maintenance andoperation would have to meet the requirements we are proposing in thisdocument. However, the Administrator would approve a closed breeding facilityonly when he or she determines that sufficient veterinarians employed byAPHIS are available to provide the services required by the facility. Theoperator of the facility would have to bear its costs and all costs associatedwith its maintenance and operation.We would require that a closed breeding facility be located in a countrythat is designated in 9 CFR 94.6(a)(2) as being considered free of viscerotropicvelogenic Newcastle disease, and be operated under conditions adequateto prevent introduction into the facility of communicable diseases of poultry.As noted above, viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease poses the greatestthreat to the poultry industry of all communicable diseases of poultry.A requirement that the country be free of this disease would be consistentwith current APHIS regulations that allow poultry eggs to be imported intothe United States without quarantine only if they are imported from a countryconsidered free of the disease. The closed breeding facility would have to be maintained under the supervisionof a veterinarian employed by APHIS and a salaried veterinarian of thenational veterinary services of the country in which it is located. Inthis proposal, we specify required inspections by that salaried veterinarian.We are proposing construction and procedural requirements regarding theclosed breeding facility, to prevent the introduction into the facilityof communicable diseases of poultry. The closed breeding facility wouldhave to be at least one-half mile from any premises containing any of thefollowing: poultry, a poultry processing plant, a poultry egg-laying farm,an aviary, a pigeon loft, a pet shop, a game bird breeding facility, ahatchery, or a poultry breeding farm. We have determined that the diseaseagent for viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease can travel in aerosolfashion, but is unlikely to do so for more than one-half mile. Specificrequirements regarding doors and fences would be imposed to help preventaccidental entry of other birds and carnivores, and the entry of unauthorizedindividuals. The bird holding area would have to include windows that providea full view of its interior, to allow supervisors to monitor activitiesin the area.Effective sanitation and hygiene would be important in keeping the closedbreeding facility free of disease. We would require procedures, includingcleaning and disinfection, to keep the facility free from vermin, and fromcontamination that might otherwise occur from waste material and improperdrainage.To avoid human transmission of diseases harmful to birds or poultry, allindividuals entering the bird holding area would (1) be permitted to haveno contact with poultry or birds outside the bird holding area for at least3 days before entering the bird holding area (a period of time sufficientto ensure that any disease organisms on the individuals will die beforecontact with the birds); (2) have to shower when entering and leaving thebird holding area; and (3) have to dress in work clothing and footwearthat has not been worn since it was last washed and that is available atthe facility, when entering the bird holding area, and change out of thatclothing and footwear upon leaving the bird holding area. To facilitatethe showering and changing, there would have to be (1) a shower at theentrance into the bird holding area and a clothes storage and change areaat each end of the shower; (2) restrooms at each end of the shower area;and (3) a receptacle in the clothes storage and change area nearest thebird holding area for clothes worn in the bird holding area. The operatorof the closed breeding facility would have to collect used work clothingat the end of each workday and keep it in a bag until the clothing is washed.Footwear that has been worn in the bird holding area would either haveto be left in the clothes change area or cleaned and disinfected.A guard employed by the country in which the closed breeding facility islocated would have to be posted at the facility at all times to preventbirds in the bird holding area from having contact with either individualsnot authorized entry into the facility or other birds and animals. We wouldrequire that the guard be employed by the country where the closed breedingfacility is located to ensure that he or she has maximum authority to preventunauthorized entry into the facility. We believe that if the guard wereemployed directly by the closed breeding facility, conflicts might arisebetween his or her security responsibilities and his or her obligationsto the employing facility. The guard would have to keep a daily log torecord the entry and exit of all individuals entering the bird holdingarea. Access to the closed breeding facility would be restricted to individualsworking at the facility, certain other authorized individuals, veterinariansemployed by APHIS, and salaried veterinarians of the national veterinaryservices of the country in question.We would also require that the closed breeding facility have a necropsyroom containing a necropsy table, a hood with a viewing window over thetable, refrigerated storage space for carcasses retained for laboratoryexamination, a sink with running water, and the following equipment: scissors,forceps, tweezers, BHI media, sterile tubes, and rubber gloves. Additionally,we would require that the closed breeding facility have office space forrecordkeeping.The operator of the closed breeding facility would have to supply APHISwith certain written information regarding day-to-day operations at thefacility. This information would include the telephone number of the facility'soperator or an individual who can act for the operator, and a current listof employees of the facility who are designated to handle and care forbirds in the facility. We would need the list of employees to determinewhether security procedures required elsewhere in the proposed regulationsare being effectively carried out. We would also require a signed statementfrom each of the designated personnel at the facility that they will haveno contact with poultry and birds for 3 days before entering the bird holdingarea.<ITAG tagnum="85">Birds Imported From the Closed Breeding Facility</ITAG>Before the birds are shipped from the closed breeding facility to the UnitedStates, we would require certain procedures to ensure that none of thebirds are carrying communicable diseases of poultry when shipped. In order to monitor the source of any possible disease spread among birdsintended for importation into the United States, each bird hatched in theclosed breeding facility would have to be banded with a serially numberedlegband coded to the closed breeding facility. The legbanding would haveto be done within 30 days after hatching, because after that time it isanatomically difficult or impossible to band the birds with closed legbands.The legbands would have to be supplied by the operator of the closed breedingfacility and would have to be individually identifiable closed legbands.For at least 30 days immediately before their shipment to the United States,birds imported from an approved closed breeding facility would have tobe kept in a bird holding area, separate from other birds in the facility.This would allow sufficient time for any disease in the birds to clinicallymanifest itself before the birds are shipped to the United States. At least 21 days before the birds are shipped to the United States, cloacalsamples from all of the birds in the shipment, or from 150 birds in theshipment, whichever is fewer, would have to be submitted to the NationalVeterinary Services Laboratories in Ames, Iowa, by a salaried veterinarianof the national veterinary services of the country in question. For thebirds to be allowed importation into the United States, the samples wouldhave to test negative for viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease andforms of avian influenza lethal to poultry, using standard virus isolationprocedures carried out of the National Veterinary Services Laboratories.We are including a footnote (footnote 3) in this poposed rule indicatingwhere to write for copies of the virus isolation procedures used. Submissionof the samples at least 21 days before shipment of the birds to the UnitedStates is necessary to allow sufficient time for laboratory isolation ofthe samples. The samples would have to be collected within 28 days beforethe birds are shipped to the United States. By collecting samples no earlierthan 28 days before shipment, any disease that a bird might contract beforethe 30-day separation period would be detectable by the time the samplesare taken. Testing a maximum of 150 birds in any lot has been shown statisticallyto be effective in determining whether a disease of concern has occurredin the lot. At least 21 days before the birds are shipped to the United States, necropsysamples from lung, trachea, terminal gut, and spleen, either from all birdsthat were kept in a bird holding area and that died, or from 30 of thesebirds, whichever is fewer, must be submitted to the National VeterinaryServices Laboratories, Ames, Iowa, by a salaried veterinarian of the nationalveterinary services of the country in which the approved closed breedingfacility is located. In lots of more than 30 birds, samples from 30 ofthe birds have statistically been proven effective in detecting diseaseorganisms in that lot. The samples would have to be taken from birds that were kept in a birdholding area and that died between 30 and 21 days before the birds in thebird holding area are shipped to the United States. The 30-day outsidelimit represents the first day of the birds intended for shipment wereisolated from other birds; the 21-day minimum represents the minimum timenecessary to complete testing before shipment of the birds to the UnitedStates. Before the birds may be shipped to the United States, the samplesmust test negative for viscerotropic velogenic Newcastle disease and formsof avian influenza lethal to poultry, using standard virus isolation procedurescarried out at the National Veterinary Services laboratories. The operator of the closed breeding facility would have to collect dailyany birds that die while in the bird holding area, and refrigerate themuntil specimens are collected. The refrigeration temperature could be nowarmer than 35 anddegrees;F if the birds are autopsied daily, and no warmerthan  0anddegrees;F if the birds are autoposied more than 1 day after beingplaced under refrigeration. The operator of the closed breeding facilitywould not be permitted to dispose of any carcass or parts of a carcassunless permitted to do so by a salaried veterinarian of the national veterinaryservices of the country in question, and would have to account for allbirds in the closed breeding facility. We are also proposing provisions for treating psittacine birds, and non-psittacinebirds that are kept in the bird holding area with the psittacine birdsand shipped with them to the United States, with feed containing chlortetracycline(CTC), for at least 30 days immediately before shipment of the birds tothe United States. We believe this treatment is necessary as a preventivemeasure against chlamydiosis (psittacosis, ornithosis), a communicabledisease of birds and poultry and also a disease that can be transmittedto humans. Although chlamydiosis can be spread to birds other than psittacinebirds, psittacines are the primary carriers of the disease, and it appearsthat a 30-day treatment with CTC is sufficient to rid a bird of chlamydiosis.After hatching, any bird that is imported into the United States from theapproved closed breeding facility must be banded with a serially numberedlegband coded to the facility. The legband must be an individually identifiableclosed legband. The birds must be moved from the bird holding area to anaircraft for shipment to the United States in the presence of a salariedveterinarian of the national veterinary services of the country in whichthe facility is located. The aircraft, which may contain no other birdsor poultry, must move, without stopping, from the country in which thefacility is located to the United States port of entry. From the time thebirds leave the bird holding area, until their importation into the UnitedStates, they may have no contact with any other birds or poultry. We are also proposing to require that all birds in the shipment that dieenroute from the approved closed breeding facility to the United Statesbe made availale to a veterinarian employed by APHIS at the port of entry.Additionally, for the birds to be exempt from the quarantine requirementsin current 9 CFR 92.11(e), there would have to be no evidence that anybird in the shipment has any communicable disease of poultry, based onport of entry inspection. <ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Approval of a Closed Breeding Facility </ITAG>We are including in this proposal instructions for requesting approvalfor a closed breeding facility. We are also including in this proposalrequirements for a pre-approval inspection of the facility by APHIS, andrequirements for an Advance Payment Agreement to cover the cost of thepre-approval inspection. If the closed breeding facility is approved, the facility's operator wouldhave to execute with APHIS another Advance Payment Agreement to cover thecosts to the United States Department of Agriculture relating to the shipmentof birds from the facility into the United States, and relating to ongoinginspections of the facility by a veterinarian employed by APHIS. We are proposing that the Administrator will deny or withdraw approvalof any closed breeding facility if: (1) Any provisions of the proposedregulations is not met; (2) the operator of the facility or a person responsiblyconnected with the business (as explained in the proposed regulations)has been convicted of a crime regarding the importation of an animal orbird into any jurisdiction; (3) the operator or a responsibly connectedperson has been convicted of any crime involving fraud, bribery, or extortion(all of which demonstrate a lack of integrity); or (4) no birds have beenshipped from the facility to the United States for one year. We would alsoallow an operator to request voluntary withdrawal of approval. We would establish due process procedures regarding a denial or withdrawalof approval, which would include adoption of rules of practice for a proceedingand an opportunity for a hearing when there is dispute of material factregarding the denial or withdrawal. To help the Administrator determine if grounds exist for denial or withdrawalof approval, and to facilitate action by APHIS in the event of a violationof the regulations, we would require from the operator of the facilityhis or her name and those of all persons responsibly connected with thebusiness of the closed breeding facility, and the addresses of the operatorand of certain specified responsibly connected persons. We would also provide that denial or withdrawal of approval will not bebased solely on the conviction of a responsibly connected person if theoperator of the facility agrees to and complies with a consent agreementwith the Administrator that the responsibly connected person will neveragain be associated with the closed breeding facility. <ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous </ITAG>We are proposing to remove the definition of the word ``Operator'' in andSection;92.1,because it does not aid in the understanding of the word. Further, we areproposing to add the definition of the terms ``Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service'' and ``Bird holding area'' to the definitions in andSection;92.1 to clarify the meaning of those terms as used in this proposal. <ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this proposed rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291,and we have determined that it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on informationsupplied by the Department, we have determined that this action would havean effect on the economy of less than $100 million; would not cause a majorincrease in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, federal,state, or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and would notcause a significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or export markets.Based on industry projections, we believe that if this proposed rule ispublished as a final rule, approximately 200,000 parakeets will be importedannually from closed breeding facilities outside the United States. Weexpect that no brids other than parakeets would be imported under thisrule. If there were any year in which the sale of the entire 200,000 importedbirds would directly compete with the sale of birds that are produced bybreeders in the United States, the dollar amount competed for would totala maximum of $1.4 million annually, based on a payment or breeders of $5.00to $7.00 per parakeet. Based upon a Department survey, there are at least12,000 parakeet breeders in the United States, virtually all of whom aresmall entities. The projected number of birds to be imported from the closedbreeding facility would at most account for an average of approximately$117 annually per breeder that would otherwise be paid to breeders in theUnited States. Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action would not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities. <ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>Information collection requirements contained in this document have beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) under the provisionsof the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) and have been assigned OMB control number 0579-0040.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372, which requiresintergovernmental consultation with State and local officials.
