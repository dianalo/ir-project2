Khamenei, speaking at a news conference, also denied that Iran'sparliament speaker, Hashemi Rafsanjani, had called for the murderof Westerners. He said Rafanjani's words were distorted by theWestern media.   Rafsanjani, previously regarded as a moderate who supportedbetter ties with the West, is expected to succeed Khamenei when hefinishes his term in office later this year.   ``The decision made about Salman Rushdie is still valid,''Khamenei said. ``As I have already said, this is a bullet for whichthere is a target. It has been shot. It will one day sooner orlater hit the target.''   Iran's spiritual leader, the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomenei, inFebruary said Rushdie must be killed for writing ``The SatanicVerses,'' which contains passages many Moslems say are insulting tothe Prophet Mohammed.   Rushdie has been in hiding since the death threat was issued.   Khamenei, on a six-day visit to China, also said Rafsanjani``has not recommended anybody kill anybody.''   The Iranian speaker, he said, was offering an analysis that U.S.policies toward ``the oppressed people of Palestine would only leadto such a situation.''   In a speech Friday, Rafsanjani reportedly called on Palestiniansto kill five American, French or British citizens in retaliationfor each Arab slain in the uprising in the Israeli-occupiedterritories.   He later denied that he supported the killing of Westerncivilians.   Earlier today, Khamenei met with China's senior leader, DengXiaoping, who expressed hope that Iran and Iraq, which have agreedto a cease-fire after their eight-year war, will live in peace.   ``All the Third World countries should unite and refrain fromwasting their strength on disputes,'' Deng was quoted by theofficial Xinhua News Agency as saying. ``We also hope to see astable Middle East.''   Deng, 84, looking frail and meeting Khamenei for only 20minutes, noted that China is also working for internationalstability.   Khamenei also has met Communist Party General Secretary ZhaoZiyang and Premier Li Peng for talks that have included China'sparticipation in reconstruction of Iran's war-torn economy.   Khamenei leaves Friday for Xinjiang, China's far-westernprovince which has a large Moslem minority.</TEXT></DOC>
