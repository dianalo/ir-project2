There have been numerous reports, however,of engine flameouts in falling and/or blowing snow when only the particleseparator was installed. Since this condition is likely to exist or developon helicopters of the same type design, an AD is being issued which requiresthat both the snow deflectors and particle separator be installed on allBell Model 206A and 206B helicopters when operating in falling and/or blowingsnow. Since a situation exists that requires the immediate adoption of this regulation,it is found that notice and public procedure hereon are impracticable,and good cause exists for making this amendment effective in less than30 days. The regulations adopted herein do not have substantial direct effects onthe states, on the relationship between the national government and thestates, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities among thevarious levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with Executive Order12612, it is determined that this final rule does not have sufficient federalismimplications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. The FAA has determined that this regulation is an emergency regulationand that it is not considered to be major under Executive Order 12291.It is impracticable for the agency to follow the procedures of ExecutiveOrder 12291 with respect to this rule since the rule must be issued immediatelyto correct an unsafe condition in aircraft. It has been further determinedthat this action involves an emergency regulation under DOT RegulatoryPolicies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). If this actionis subsequently determined to involve a significant/major regulation, afinal regulatory evaluation or analysis, as appropriate, will be preparedand placed in the regulatory docket (otherwise, an evaluation or analysisis not required). A copy of it, when filed, may be obtained from the RegionalRules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39 </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_AIRWORTHINESS DIRECTIVES </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration amends andSection; 39.13 of Part 39 ofthe Federal Aviation Regulations as follows: 1.
