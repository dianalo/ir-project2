(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   NASA engineers say they can beginfinal testing of space shuttle Discovery's payload now that a $100million spacecraft-tracking satellite has been loaded into thecargo bay.   The tests are scheduled for the first two weeks of September andare intended to ensure the payload, nearly identical to onedestroyed in the 1986 Challenger explosion, was installed properly,said George Diller, a spokesman for the National Aeronautics andSpace Administration.   One test will involve the launch control center in Florida andone will involve a ground-based tracking station at White Sands,N.M.   The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, designed to help groundcontrollers monitor shuttles and their payloads, is the principalcargo for the 26th space shuttle mission, scheduled for launch inlate September or early October.   Loading the satellite took 10 hours Monday and was completedwith no significant problems, Diller said. Deployment of thesatellite is set for the first day of the four-day Discoverymission.   Payload engineers and technicians, wary of the potential oflightning from a tropical weather system that moved up the coast,had been working feverishly during the weekend to prepare for thesatellite-loading.   NASA officials in Washington, meanwhile, decided not to announcea date for the resumption of space shuttle flights until after areview Sept. 13-14, said spokesman Jim Kast.   NASA had scheduled _ and postponed _ the launch five datespreviously, beginning with July 15, 1987. The U.S. manned spaceprogram has been grounded since the January 1986 Challengerexplosion that killed seven astronauts.</TEXT></DOC>
