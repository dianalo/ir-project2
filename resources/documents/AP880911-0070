An estimated 5,000 people paid homage at the modest tomb in acemetery in this coastal resort.   When the service ended bands of militants marched out of thecemetery and were confronted by ranks of helmeted riot police. Thepolice used tear gas, clubs and water cannons to disperse themarchers.   Several people were arrested and reporters saw a fewdemonstrators injured, including a young man bleeding from the headafter being clubbed by two policemen. Officials did not give anyfigures on the numbers of arrests or injured.   It was the largest graveside tribute to Allende who was buriedin the suburban cemetery a day after his death during the Sept. 11,1973, coup led by Gen. Augusto Pinochet, the army commander whothen became president.   The regional government in Vina del Mar, 75 miles northwest ofSantiago, had authorized only a brief procession and when themilitants attemped to march on the city center the police blockedthem.   According to the military government, Allende shot himself inthe head with a carbine that was a gift from Cuban President FidelCastro as the Presidential Palace was in flames and under attack bytroops. Allende had declared he would not allow himself to bedeposed and taken out of the palace alive, and the military versionis accepted by most Chileans and historians.   But his followers said after the coup he was killed by police orsoldiers who shot their way into his office.   The military government had barred the placing of a tombstonewith Allende's name at the grave, but on Sunday there was a smallmarble plaque with the inscription: ``Salvador Allende Gossens,June 26, 1908 _ September 11, 1973. President of Chile, 1970-1073.Tribute of the Chilean Socialist Party.''   Groups of people began arriving at the cemetery in midmorning,many placing red and white carnations at the tomb. By noon, some5,000 people had gathered and a carpet of carnations covered thetomb.   A man in his 20s stood beside the tomb for a few minutes andthen collapsed, sobbing. Many other mourners also wept.   The crowd was quiet as loudspeakers broadcast a recording ofAllende's last speech on the day of the coup.   ``You don't stop social processes with crime or by force,'' hesaid, speaking through by telephone from the besieged palace to theonly Santiago radio station that not been taken over by themilitary. Gunfire and explosions could be heard in the background.   After the recording people in the crowd chanted, ``We can feelit, we can feel it, Allende is here.''   They also shouted, ``Pinochet is going to fall, the dictatorshipis going to fall.''   Attending the service were a grandson of Allende, Gonzalo Meza,and a niece, Denise Pascal. But Allende's daughter, Isabel, whoreturned to Chile Sept. 1 when the government ended the officialexile of about 500 leftists, was not present. She had visited thegrave privately last week and on Saturday.</TEXT></DOC>
