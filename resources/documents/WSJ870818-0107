BulkeleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LTLE PLENTENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   Plenum Publishing Corp., rejected once by Arthur D. Little Inc., raised its bid for the consulting firm to $55 a share, or $143 million, from $50 a share.    New York-based Plenum also said it &quot;is prepared to substantially increase&quot; the latest bid if a review of Little's business and finances shows the bid to be inadequate.    In Cambridge, Mass., Little and the Memorial Drive Trust, a profit-sharing trust for Little employees that controls 75% of the company's shares, declined to comment on the increased bid.    In national over-the-counter trading, Little stock jumped $5 yesterday to close at $45.    Little and the trust had rejected Plenum's unsolicited July proposal, citing a desire for the 110-year-old scientific and technical consulting firm to remain independent, the risk of losing consultants to competitors following a takeover, and an advisory opinion by Goldman Sachs andamp; Co. that the $50-a-share bid was inadequate.    Plenum, a little-known publisher of scientific journals, made it clear it was trying to overcome those objections.    In a letter to John F. Magee, Little's chairman and chief executive officer and one of the four Memorial Drive trustees, Martin Tash, chairman of Plenum, said &quot;continued independence&quot; of Little and its consultants is of &quot;paramount importance.&quot; As a result, he said, Plenum would operate Little as a separate subsidiary with a special advisory committee dominated by Little employees.    The new bid is conditional on review of Little's finances and severance agreements that the company initiated after Plenum made its first proposal. As previously reported, Little promised about 700 of its 2,600 employees six to 18 months' salary if they leave their jobs under certain conditions after a change in control of the company.    Mr. Magee wasn't available for comment yesterday. However, he has said that &quot;maintaining Arthur D. Little as an independent company best serves the long-term interests of its shareholders.&quot;    Mr. Tash's letter said he found Mr. Magee's refusal to meet with him &quot;most disappointing.&quot;    Many consultants and other employees at Little have said they like the college-like atmosphere at the company's sprawling facilities and fear it would be lost if the company was part of a larger corporation. However, some retired employees, who have an interest in the trust, have said the potential financial gains from selling the stock are attractive.    Plenum made its proposal to the trust, and said it would acquire remaining stock on the same terms. </TEXT></DOC>
