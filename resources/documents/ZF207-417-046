501-2,500 characters, $.75;2,501-7,500 characters, $1; each additional 7,500 characters, $1.andM;Requires: Modern-equipped IBM-compatible computer with communicationssoftware.andM;In Short: Proprietary links to CompuServe give MCI Mail subscribers access tothe largest combined e-mail user base around.andP;  The ability to access mailinglists and forms that have been &quot;published&quot; on-line, and new flexible ratesfor low-volume users, may make MCI Mail even more attractive for theindividual subscriber.andM;MCI Mail delivers all of the e-mail features users have come to expect.andP;  Thedefault command-line interface waits for you to type in your request;English-language commands like Scan Inbox, Edit Envelope, or Send do theobvious.andP;  Standard handling options let you indicate how the message shouldbe delivered simply by adding a comment in parentheses after the addressee'sname--(Telex), for example.andM;By adding (EMS) to that same field, MCI delivers something more.andP;  Thiscommand allows you to send messages to users linked to other e-mail services,including Italy's PT Postel, France's Missive, and, most notably, the 450,000active mailboxes on CompuServe.andM;PAST MCI SERVICESandM;In the past, MCI Mail's Advanced and Basic services were differentiated byprice and features.andP;  Either service is now available for an annual fee of$25, or a minimum monthly usage charge of $10.andP;  The latter entitles you to 40electronic messages or domestic faxes--after that, the normal per-messagerate (based on the number of characters) applies.andP;  This kind of flexiblebilling should appeal to low-volume users.andM;Featurewise, only a few differences remain: Advanced users can store messageson-line for 5 days and Basic users for 24 hours; Advanced service providesthe default command structure, while Basic service offers a menu interface(you can call MCI to change from the command to the menu interface).andP;  In mostother respects, the two services are functionally identical.andM;MCI messages can contain statements to qualify an addressee's name.andP;  This ishelpful if you want to reach a Mr. Smith, for example, but don't know hisfirst name.andP;  If you know that he works for Widget Inc., you can find him byaddressing your message to &quot;Smith/Widget&quot;.andP;  If you just address it to&quot;Smith&quot;, MCI will scroll across your screen the full name and mailbox addressof every Smith who subscribes and prompt you to choose the correct one.andM;SUBSCRIBER OPTIONSandM;MCI Mail offers the same delivery options as ATandamp;T: electronic messages, papermail, courier overnight delivery, telex, and fax.andP;  But where ATandamp;T allowsusers to share resources only through so-called &quot;private&quot; folders, MCI Mailuses the term &quot;publish&quot; to designate how open mailing lists and on-line formscan be.andP;  The owner of a list or a form controls who has access to it, butanyone can use the Find command to discover what's available.andP;  A complicationto this is that MCI's version of on-line forms requires you to develop theMail Script off-line in dBASE.andM;Subscribers can also create bulletin boards on MCI Mail's network.andP;  For a $25charge per month, organizations can keep their members apprised of the latestnews, or businesses can provide customer support.andP;  The Dow JonesNews/Retrieval database is available, but beware--the billing structurechanges once you are logged on to it.andP;  Rates become time- and bps-sensitive,meaning that you pay per connected minute and that costs are higher forbusiness hours and for faster transmission rates.andM;EXPRESSING YOUR MESSAGESandM;If what interests you most is sending and receiving electronic mail, youshould consider Lotus Express, a proprietary communications package developedjointly by MCI and Lotus Development Corp.andP;  It can be run either as astandalone program or as a Lotus Metro desktop accessory.andP;  This TSR workswith Lotus-style menus, runs only in background mode, and makes communicatingwith MCI Mail virtually transparent.andP;  Express gives users a mail-managementsystem in which folders can be created and messages stored.andP;  All of thesefunctions take place off-line.andP;  Perhaps most important, the only way you cantransfer binary files via MCI Mail is to use Express's attachment feature.andO;The $150 package (the price includes a first-year subscription to MCI Mail)is available from Lotus ((617)577-8500).andM;The biggest drawback to Lotus Express is that it takes up too much memory;LIM 4.0 support would be a welcome upgrade.andP;  Be sure you learn how to unloadExpress from memory--you will undoubtedly find that at least one of yourfavorite applications will require you to do this all the time.andM;NETWORK HOOKUPSandM;Several third-party software vendors have announced products intended to letnetwork users link up to MCI Mail transparently, just as Lotus Express doesfor individual users.andP;  LAN-based e-mail products with gateway services to MCIhave been announced (but not shipped) by the Network Courier, TheCoordinator, and Da Vinci.andP;  All of these links are proprietary to MCI Mail.andO;Although MCI has come out in favor of the X.400 standard and has even signedan agreement with PT Postel in Italy, as of this writing there are no liveX.400 links to MCI.andM;MCI has led the way in interconnectivity with its proprietary link toCompuServe.andP;  But now it must act on X.400 links with domestic vendors or risklosing its leadership position.andP;  When you consider that MCI and ATandamp;T Maildeliver easy-to-use services, and that EasyLink (with 175,000 activemailboxes in 1988) and MCI (with 100,000 active mailboxes as of last year,plus access to CompuServe users) deliver the largest subscriber bases, aconclusion is easy to reach.andP;  MCI remains the winner for individuals seekinge-mail capabilities--at the moment.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
