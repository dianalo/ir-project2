A growing number of companies are stepping up advertising, promotions and other sales tactics to try to capture a larger share of the multibillion-dollar military-personnel market. American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. pitches a special billing card and long-distance price discounts to enlisted men and women, while Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. recruits retired servicemen to sell insurance policies to active members of the military.    Colgate-Palmolive Co. has been running an ad for its Fresh Start detergent in military publications that shows a laundry bag full of dirty fatigues underneath the headline, &quot;The only easier way to do the wash is to send it home to Mom.&quot; There are even military-marketing maneuvers overseas: Miller Brewing Co., a unit of Philip Morris Cos., is sponsoring rock bands that play at U.S. bases in West Germany and promote its Genuine Draft beer.    What sparked the growing interest? It isn't that the military market is mushrooming -- there are about 2.1 million active-duty personnel now, compared with roughly 3.5 million in 1968, during the Vietnam War. Neither is Uncle Sam paying members of the armed forces so handsomely that they have lots more disposable income.    The military is commanding more attention mainly because it is one of the few remaining consumer groups that marketers haven't yet saturated with advertising and promotions. Until recently, people in the military have been a rather neglected group -- quite surprising in this era of market segmentation and niche marketing.    &quot;Members of the military are relatively low paid, but they spend a lot of money with us because they move around so often and want to keep in touch with their families,&quot; says Brian Sullivan, ATandamp;T's military-market manager. &quot;We've been steadily increasing our military budget.&quot;    Marketing-promotion and media-buying concerns are making the military more accessible to companies like ATandamp;T. They are installing electronic billboards in exchanges and commissaries, distributing coupon and product-sample kits on military bases and selling ad space in a network of about 200 base newspapers.    &quot;Some advertisers tell me they realized the military was an important market with its 2.1 million active members, but they never knew how to reach it,&quot; says Stuart Hochwert, vice president of Seattle-based American Passage Media Corp., which recently began placing ads in base newspapers.    In many ways, the interest in the military parallels marketers' growing desire to reach college students. Both groups are ripe targets for cultivating brand loyalty. They're in their late teens and early 20s and are living on their own for the first time. &quot;With all the young men in the military, we'd like to win them over as customers at an early age and keep them when they're back in civilian life,&quot; says Tom Materazo, Warner-Lambert Co.'s sales director for military and special markets.    To that end, Warner-Lambert is scheduling a different military promotion every three months in 1988. It hopes, for example, to get prominent display space for Schick razors, Listerine mouthwash and other products in commissaries by raffling off mopeds, ocean-cruise vacations and other prizes. &quot;We're already looking to 1989 to repeat these kinds of promotions,&quot; Mr. Materazo says.    But the Defense Department isn't giving marketers free rein on its military bases. MarketSource Corp., Cranbury, N.J., convinced base commanders to display its electronic billboards only by giving them space on the boards for a calendar of events and other informational announcements.    Alcohol and tobacco companies, in particular, face marketing barriers. For instance, commissaries aren't permitted to accept cents-off coupons for alcohol and tobacco products targeted only to military personnel. Similarly, liquor and tobacco companies can't conduct contests or sporting events at military installations.    The government's official armed-forces magazines traditionally have been off-limits to all advertisers. But recently, the Army and Navy started considering farming theirs out to commercial publishers who would accept ads. &quot;We're exploring it to see how much money we could save on our Soldiers magazine,&quot; an Army spokesman says.    The Air Force, however, opposes any such commercialization of its Airman magazine. Says Capt. Chris Canfield, an Air Force spokesman: &quot;Commercial messages would compete with and could dilute the impact of the Air Force's messages in the magazine. Some ads might even be at odds with official Air Force policies and positions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
