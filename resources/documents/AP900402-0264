(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fleet-Norstar Financial Group saidMonday it expects its non-performing loans to increase by at least$200 million in the first quarter, making it the latest bank to behit by New England's sagging economy.   The company said its level of non-performing loans would reachat least $600 million and could go higher as a result of anexamination now being conducted by federal regulators.   ``We have not estimated what the reserve might be or what theearnings might be,'' said Robert W. Lougee Jr., a Fleet spokesman.   He said the company's first-quarter earnings report could bedelayed past the April 18 annual meeting, depending on the outcomeof the examination.   Fleet also said it would sell about half of its credit cardportfolio of about $500 million to Norwest Corp. of Minneapolis.The sale and a change in investments for the corporation's pensionplan is expected to produce a one-time gain of $90 million beforetaxes for the first quarter, Fleet said.   A $600 million level of non-performing loans would amount toabout 2.6 percent of Fleet's loan and lease portfolio of about$22.5 billion. That still is lower than the industry average ofabout 3 percent, Lougee said.   The bad loans had been identified ``largely on our own'' and notat the insistence of federal regulators, Lougee said, although``we're clearly aware the regulators are here.''   Fleet has been praised for its diversification, with almosttwo-thirds of its assets outside of New England, and for steeringclear of much of the overbuilt condominium market, which rapidlycollapsed during the past year.   But, ``other segments of commercial real estate have clearlybeen affected,'' Lougee said, including office parks and smallshopping centers.   The bad loans ``are spread out in the commercial real estateportfolio,'' he said.   According to Fleet's first-quarter filing with the Securitiesand Exchange Commission, about $8.4 billion of its loan portfoliois in commercial and industrial loans and loans to other financialinstitutions.</TEXT></DOC>
