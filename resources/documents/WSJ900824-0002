A seat on the New York Stock Exchange changed handsyesterday at $301,000, the lowest sale price since Dec. 17,1984. The last sale at a price below $300,000 took place afew days earlier in 1984.</LP><TEXT>   On Monday, an American Stock Exchange seat sold for$107,500, the lowest price since January 1980.   &quot;I would anticipate that if the market continues todecline, seat prices will decline with it,&quot; says Perrin Long,securities industry analyst at Lipper Analytical.   He says it's hard to predict how low seat prices willfall, as prices will to some degree be tied to marketperformance. He says that if the Dow Jones Industrial Averagefalls to the 2000 level, NYSE seat prices could fall to the$200,000 to $225,000 range. The average, which reached arecord high of 2999.75 in mid-July, closed below 2500yesterday.   Charles Vincent, a vice president and securities analystat Provident National Bank, says falling stock prices usuallymean lower trading volume and lower revenue for securitiesfirms, which cut the value of exchange memberships.   But the drop in exchange seat prices is a trend that longpredates the recent stock plunge tied to Mideast tensions.Analysts cite the drop-off in equity trading volume from thehigh levels of 1986 and early 1987 as one big reason, and Mr.Long says the increased role of electronic equities tradingalso has contributed to the decline in the value of exchangeseats.   NYSE seat prices peaked Sept. 21, 1987, at $1,150,000.That sale was one of seven made in 1987 for $1 million ormore. After the October 1987 world-wide stock market crash,seat prices declined. The last sale of 1987 was made on Dec.29 for $625,000.</TEXT></DOC>
