Edward Kennedy, after touringcapital-area AIDS clinics on Tuesday, outlined a comprehensive planhe said would assure medical care, support services and protectionfrom discrimination for AIDS patients.   The Massachusetts Democrat met with AIDS victims and visitedAIDS and drug treatment clinics Tuesday morning. Later he said thecost of his plan _ about $500 million in fiscal 1990 _ should beviewed as ``an investment.''   ``It is justifiable in terms of resources and essential in termsof public health,'' said Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Labor andHuman Resources Committee and a strong advocate for AIDS patients.   Kennedy noted that the number of Americans diagnosed with AIDSrecently surpassed 100,000 and nearly 60,000 have died from thedisease.   ``Those who persist in thinking that this epidemic does notconcern them must take note of these figures,'' he said at a newsconference.   Kennedy said his tour of treatment facilities convinced him ofthe need for a strategy to combat ``the twin epidemics of AIDS anddrugs which plague our inner cities.'' He said that will seekdramatic expansion of out-patient care facilities. Intravenous drugusers and their sexual partners are the fastest growing group ofAIDS victims.   Belinda Mason, a 30-year-old activist with AIDS who was namedlast week by President Bush to serve on the National AIDSCommission, told reporters Kennedy's plan is ``excellent news forall of us.''   She said she has known discrimination all too well sincecontracting AIDS from a blood transfusion during childbirth.Shortly after she was diagnosed in 1987, she recalls hearing thatthe pool in her community of Hartford, Ky., was closed ostensiblyfor a filtering problem. Soon, however, she learned that ``it wasthe presence of my body in the water that led to it being closed.''   Kennedy's plan, she said, would help make life for AIDS victims``more humane and equitable.''   ``People with HIV (the virus that causes AIDS) and AIDS onlywant what everyone else wants _ we want a job and home and theright to a decent life,'' she said.   Kennedy said stronger anti-discrimination protection for AIDSvictims is the most important piece of his plan. Such protectionwas dropped from an AIDS bill in the last Congress in order to stemcontroversy and win passage of the measure.   Kennedy's committee currently is considering legislation tostrengthen safeguards for AIDS victims against discrimination inemployment, public services, housing, transportation andcommunications. The measure is expected to come up next week.   Kennedy says he also will push to extend for three years aprogram that helps low-income AIDS victims pay for life-prolongingtreatments. The program, which expires Sept. 30, won approval fromKennedy's committee last week.   Other parts of the Kennedy plan would:   _Ensure that promising new AIDS treatments are made available asquickly as possible and that $6 million for community-based drugtesting be doubled next fiscal year.   _Provide comprehensive medical care and support services forAIDS patients and housing for the growing number of homeless peoplewith AIDS.   _Permit AIDS victims to keep their private health insuranceafter they become disabled.   _Provide AIDS-prevention information to drug users.   _Help communities hit hardest by AIDS give financial assistanceto hospitals and other facilities overburdened by the crisis.   Kennedy's $500 million plan would be in addition to Bush'sproposed $1.6 billion for AIDS research and education in fiscal1990.</TEXT></DOC>
