<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-78-0562 </DOCNO><TEXT>A discussion of the near-term outlook for the natural gas market in theUSA begins with a prediction of the end of the gas oversupply situation(or gas bubble) in that country. Aspects of the current situation includea gas demand that is unrestrained by pricing, decline in deliverability,and a declining total addition to reserves relative to production. Factorsthat can affect the market include the seasonal nature of gas demand,with winter demand peaks; the degree of switching by homeowners currentlyusing oil heating; the price of crude oil, which affects the drillingand exploration process for natural gas; and the increasing use of naturalgas by electric utilities in combined-cycle generating plants. Canadianopportunities in future American markets are then outlined. These are:system supply for pipelines or distribution networks; spot market salesto industries or utilities; and a special projects market, namely, combined-cyclepower plants for the northeastern states. It is calculated that in termsof current economics, such a plant could produce electricity more cheaply,and with lower capital costs and siting times, than coal-fired plants.In the past, developments of gas-fired plants has been hindered by lackof assurance of long term supply; the reserve picture for Canada is feltto be suitable for the provision of long-term supply contracts for suchfacilities, thus indicating a significant market opportunity. 16 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
