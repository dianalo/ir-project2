(products).andO;Product:   AccuText (Computer program).andO;Topic:     Optical Character Recognition SoftwareEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Accutext broke  OmniPage's monopoly on automatic MacandM;OCR.andP;  This isn't surprising, in view of Xerox's access to its own technologyas well as to that of acquired companies Datacopy (scanners) and Kurzweil(dedicated OCR).andP;  Like OmniPage, Accutext requires a 68020 machine with atleast 4 megabytes of RAM.andP;  In fact, in some circumstances, Accutext wantseven more than that.andM;Accutext is so memory hungry because it depends on half a dozen differentexpert-system routines and a set of  lexi- cons,&quot; each of which contains350K.andP;  The lexicons contain 50,000 words each, as well as double-letterpairs, ligature pairs, probable word beginnings and endings, and rules ofgrammar for words.andP;  Instead of just attempting to recognize individualandM;characters, Accutext tries to identify entire words.andP;  After scanning a pageand focusing on the text, it guesses what the characters are and then checksto see if they form reasonable wordsandM;If a word is questionable, Accutext marks it and continues.andP;  After itfinishes a page, the software returns to the questionable words to check ifthey are similar to other words on the page that it recognized.andP;  You cancreate your own ASCII dictionaries of up to 10,000 words for specialenvironments and load these into the Accutext armory.andM;In its default Short Menus mode, Accutext is as easy to use as OmniPage andoffers similar features for text scanning: It accepts TIFF and scanner input;offers Word, MacWrite, ASCII, and Excel output; and automatically blocks textareas.andP;  Accutext features finer control of the scanning resolution andbrightness and several more file formats for saving scans of graphics thanOmniPage.andM;Toggle to the Extended Menus mode, and you find several controls that Omni-Page doesn't have - for choosing the number of columns on a page; the markersfor questionable characters; and whether letters, numbers, or both will be ona page.andP;  You can toggle context verification and search for italics, fontsize, or underlining.andP;  Accutext recognizes the special format of superscriptsand subscripts; OmniPage doesn't.andP;  Accutext keeps no statistics on itsaccuracy; Omni- Page does, but it counts only unknown characters, notsubstitution efforts.andM;If you're not happy with the automatic process, the Preview option inAccutext lets you choose text and graphics blocks and manually set the orderof text-block analysis.andP;  You set text and image zones, link text zones, zoomin and out, delete zones from the scan, and set specific recognition rulesfor different regions.andP;  Think of it as a reverse page-layout program - callit page breakdown.andP;  A view of the page displays during scans and recognition,showing which words and lines have been completed.andP;  There's no built-in texteditor that lets you see what has been recognized, which is a real problembecause you must move to the application in which you'll be using the data(remember, you probably don't have room to run under MultiFinder), read thedocument into it, and then decide whether the scanner controls need adjustingto squeeze out additional accuracy.andM;In practice, Accutext can save moreandM;format information and is more accurate than OmniPage, but it is often muchslower, especially when scanning some pages that contain a mixture of textand graphics.andP;  If the graphic elements contain text, as do advertisements ina magazine, they are not rejected automatically and become the object oflaborious recognition work.andP;  OmniPage doesn't have that problem.andP;  You can useAccutext's Preview mechanism to cut these areas out of a scan, although youhave to do it for each page layout.andP;  (At least there's on-screen help and atoll-free number for technical support to go along with the decent manual.)andM;Accutext's extra scanning controls put it clearly ahead of OmniPage for usewith poor-quality documents, such as the yellowed daisywheel printout Itried.andP;  But using them means more time fiddling with controls.andP;  If I hadn'tstuck to 300 dpi, default contrast, and brightness scans for the testsdescribed in this article, Accutext probably could have reduced itsrecognition time and raised its accuracy.andP;  In the absence of those controls,Accutext sometimes fell behind OmniPage -even on accuracy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
