With the socialist and centrist opposition divided, theConservatives continue to look unassailable.   But some analysts say the government's prestige is threatened byrising inflation and interest rates, coupled with contentiousreforms of fundamental institutions including the health service,education and the legal profession.   They see a warning light in the result of Thursday's by-electionto fill the vacant parliamentary seat of Richmond, in northernEngland.   The Tories won, but their thumping 19,576-vote majority in theJune 1987 general election was slashed to 2,634 against a stunningresurgence of the centrist Democrats and Social Democrats.   It was the biggest anti-Tory swing in any constituency since Mrs.Thatcher came to office in May 1979.   United, the centrists could have taken the seat easily. But theyare deeply divided.   Labor, the main opposition party, limped in with fewer than 3,000votes, a predictable result in a wealthy rural constituency likeRichmond.   But in another by-election Thursday, in Wales, Labor saw itsmajority slip by about 6,500 votes against a much strengthenedshowing by Plaid Cymru, the separatist Welsh nationalist party.   Tory analysts say the Richmond result is not surprising for agovernment nearing midterm, when by-elections often becomeinstruments for registering protest votes.   The conservative Daily Telegraph dismissed the result as ``a mildbout of midterm unpopularity.''   But the liberal Observer, while agreeing that midterm setbacks donot diminish the government's underlying strength, also looked atthe opinion polls and said: ``Perhaps the tide is turning at last.''   A Gallup poll in The Sunday Telegraph put Labor and the Tories at35 percent each in terms of public preference, while a Harris pollfor the Observer put Labor one point ahead of the Tories, at 42percent.   The Observer said its poll of 1,027 respondents put Labor aheadfor the first time since October 1986, and was Labor's best showingsince 1983.   The Telegraph did not say how many people were questioned andneither paper reported a margin of error.   In the June 1987 general election the Conservatives took 42.3percent of the vote to Labor's 30.8 percent and won a 102-seatparliamentary majority in the 650-seat House of Commons. The nextgeneral election must be held by mid-1992, but will likely be heldsooner.   ``The Conservative Party is now losing a very large number ofvotes,'' said Professor Ivor Crewe, an Essex University analyst.   ``But these votes are being dissipated across more than oneparty. In other words, they're losing votes but they can stillexpect to go on gaining seats on a minority vote just as they did inRichmond,'' he told British Broadcasting Corp. television.   In seeking to revamp the health service, legal professions andschools and inject them with a measure of private competition, thegovernment is signaling that far from losing stamina after a decadein office, its reforming zeal is stronger than ever.   The Tories say they want to broaden consumer choice and breakdown entrenched bureaucracies.   But another Sunday Telegraph Gallup poll, published last week,found a large majority of teachers, doctors and lawyers opposing thereforms _ and a 7 percent swing in their voting intentions from theTories to Labor.   The government's prestige is suffering from an annual inflationrate above 7 percent and a prime lending rate of 14 percent.   Also, its bold plans to sell off the water supply in England andWales as part of its privatization drive is proving unpopular.Consumers fear a sharp rise in water prices if the industry is to beprofitable on the open market.   The Richmond result, said the middle-of-the-road Independentnewspaper, ``is certainly not an indication of irreversible decline.   ``In this case, an energetic administration is busily forcing agreat deal of highly contentious legislation through Parliament,much of it disturbing to middle-class voters.''   Even the usually pro-government Times of London warned that theloss of popularity stemmed not just from midterm doldrums, but frompublic suspicion of water privatization, health servicerestructuring and inflation.   ``The government faces a period of highly sensitive publicrelations,'' it said, ``and must justify its policies convincingly.''</TEXT><NOTE>___</NOTE><TEXT>   Marcus Eliason is London news editor for The Associated Press andhas been based in Britain for five years.</TEXT></DOC>
