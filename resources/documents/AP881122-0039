DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, indicted with his wifein the Wedtech scandal two weeks after his re-election to a sixthterm, vowed to fight the corruption charges ``with all of myGod-given strength.''   The indictments against the 55-year-old Democrat and his wife,Jamie Lee Garcia, 48, were issued three days after Rep. MarioBiaggi, D-N.Y., was sentenced to eight years in prison for extortingcash and stock valued at up to $3 million from the Wedtech Corp.   At least 19 people, including former White House aide LynNofziger, have been convicted in the case. Nofziger was found guiltyof illegal lobbying.   In Monday's federal grand jury indictments, the Garcias wereaccused of extorting $76,000 from Wedtech plus a $20,000interest-free loan from one-time Wedtech vice chairman Mario Morenoin exchange for obtaining ``favorable, lucrative defense contractsfor Wedtech,'' said James Fox, head of the FBI office here.   They also were accused of taking $77,500 and a diamond andemerald necklace from Wedtech founder John Mariotta and his wife,Jennie, in 1985.   Wedtech was a tiny machine shop in Garcia's South Bronxcongressional district that became a huge defense contractor througha Small Business Administration program that allowed minority-ownedfirms to obtain government contracts without competitive bidding.   But allegations of bribery, influence-peddling and otherwrongdoing enmeshed Wedtech in a series of federal and stateinvestigations that forced it into bankruptcy proceedings inDecember 1986.   ``I maintain my innocence and that of my wife and pledge to fightthis case with all of my God-given strength,' said Garcia, atwo-time Bronze Star winner in the Korean War who in 1978 became thesecond person of Puerto Rican ancestry to be elected to the House ofRepresentatives.   ``My brush with the criminal justice system has left me deeplyshaken as I have observed the government harass and intimidate mystaff, colleagues, friends and family to induce them to saysomething negative about me while virtually ignoring polygraphevidence demonstrating my innocence and all other exculpatoryinformation and testimony,'' Garcia said in a statement issuedthrough a spokesman, Bill Danvers.   The statement also said: ``I note that despite an investigationwhich has lasted nearly two years and has scrutinized virtuallyevery facet of my personal and professional life, the charges dealonly with the preposterous allegations of Mario Moreno, one of themost notorious felons of the 20th century.''   Moreno was one of four Wedtech officials who pleaded guilty tobribing government officials and cooperated with prosecutors inearlier Wedtech cases.   Moreno testified earlier this year at Biaggi's trial that thecompany had paid $80,000 to Garcia. The payments, for ``politicalfavors and political introductions'' were made to Garcia ``becausehe and his wife requested it,'' said Moreno.   Moreno also testified about numerous alleged payoffs to bankers,businessmen, union officials and a local public utility manager.   Also named in Monday's federal indictment was Attorney RalphVallone Jr., 41, of Santurce, Puerto Rico. He was accused offunneling $86,100 in Wedtech payments through his law office to Mrs.Garcia as ``consulting fees,'' passing on $76,000, and keeping$10,100 for himself.   Vallone's attorney, Hal Meyerson, said his client was innocentand the payments were legal, with Vallone being paid for legalservices and Mrs. Garcia being paid for public relations work.   The indictment did not say what Garcia did in return for thepayments and U.S. Attorney Rudolph Giuliani would not elaborate.   None of the payments, the loan or the jewelry Garcia is accusedof taking was reported on his congressional financial disclosureforms in 1984 and 1985, according to the seven-count indictment.   Vallone and the Garcias each face a maximum penalty of up to 20years in prison and $250,000 in fines if convicted of extortion, themost serious charge. They all face maximum penalties of between twoand 15 years in prison on additional charges of conspiracy, bribereceiving and receipt of an illegal gratuity.   They are to be arraigned on the indictment Dec. 1 in U.S.District Court.</TEXT></DOC>
