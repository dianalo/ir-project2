Its troubles illustrate the difficulties faced bycompanies -- Japanese, South Korean, Taiwanese or American --that are trying to compete in the market for dynamicrandom-access memory chips against the half dozen Japaneseelectronics giants that make the vast majority of such chips,known as DRAMs.</LP><TEXT>   Companies trying to compete in the DRAM market aresuffering because the costs and the technological complexityof making DRAMs are growing while the prices are stillfluctuating wildly. &quot;The DRAM business is much more difficultthan it was two to three years ago,&quot; Souji Miyawaki,executive director of the ball-bearing maker's affiliate,said in an interview.   Officials at the affiliate, NMB Semiconductor Co., saidthey are actively seeking technology from three of thelarger, more-established Japanese chip makers in order tosalvage their current generation of memory semiconductors.The officials said one of the companies was Hitachi Ltd., butthey wouldn't identify the other two.   The officials denied a report in the Japanese businessnewspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun that NMB has reached anagreement with Hitachi in which Hitachi would give NMBtechnology and NMB would produce chips in its factories to besold under Hitachi's name. But they said they hope to reachsuch an agreement with a Japanese company within a fewmonths.   A Hitachi spokesman confirmed that talks are taking place.Like the NMB officials, he said an agreement hadn't beenreached.   News of the talks followed by two months NMB'sannouncement that it expects to incur a loss of five billionyen (about $36 million) in the year ending Sept. 30 -- thefirst deficit since the six-year-old venture becameprofitable in 1988.   Until recently, NMB, which is owned 60% by Minebea groupcompanies, was the darling of investors and analysts becauseof its rapid entry into the semiconductor business and itsfresh approach to manufacturing. Its rural factories, twohours from Tokyo, are considered highly automated. NMB isoften cited as a model for other Japanese heavy-industrialcompanies, such as steelmakers, that aspire to enter thechip-making business.   In January 1990, Intel Corp. of the U.S. agreed to buy allDRAMs designed and produced by NMB and resell them under theIntel name. Two months after going public in February 1990,NMB's stock price doubled from its initial offering value toseven million yen a share.   But the rapid decline in DRAM prices over the past yearhas pummeled NMB's stock, which closed at 2.1 million yen onThursday, up 50,000 yen because of the Nihon Keizai report.   The Intel agreement fell apart in April because of pricedisagreements between the two companies. At the same time,though, Intel agreed to license its own technology to NMB sothat the Japanese company could make memory cards forportable personal computers to be sold under Intel's name.That marked a major change for NMB. In the originalagreement, the Japanese company supplied its own technology.Under the new contract, NMB essentially provides itsfactories for the use of Intel technology.   Now NMB is negotiating a similar arrengement in DRAMs.Hitachi or another major Japanese company would design thechip, and NMB would produce it.</TEXT></DOC>
