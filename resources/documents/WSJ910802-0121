The big one is the world-wide BCCI banking scandal.But the Keating Five &quot;constituent service&quot; scandal is alsorefusing to go away, prolonged by the Ethics Committee'sdecision -- in response to the senator's unsubtle threats --to delay action on the case of Alan Cranston (D., Calif.)   A common denominator of both scandals is that the Beltwayhad to be dragged kicking and screaming into noticing them.Partly that's because both involve complex financialskullduggery. Also, perhaps too many influential people inboth political parties stand to be either embarrassed orruined if all the facts come out. And, of course, if eitherscandal calls into question Washington's &quot;communitystandards&quot; on influence-peddling and constituent service thena way of life might be threatened.</LP><TEXT>   Both scandals have the potential to grow. Four of theKeating Five are off the hook on charges they asked federalregulators to go easy on Charles Keating's corrupt Sandamp;L afterreceiving large infusions of campaign cash. But Sen. Cranstonimplies that it's common practice for senators to operate insuch a quid pro quo manner, and he is willing to discuss theissue if his case ever reaches the Senate floor. As for BCCI,a former employee of the bank has told investigators that thebank took &quot;millions of dollars&quot; in bribe money to Washingtonand that members of Congress and federal officials were amongthose &quot;targeted for bribes.&quot;   Before either scandal gets bigger, it is worthwhile torecall the biggest financial scandal ever to shakeWashington. The Credit Mobilier affair of the 1870s became ahot issue in four consecutive presidential elections. Amongthose accused of bribery were a dozen congressmen, a Treasurysecretary, two vice presidents, a speaker of the House and afuture president.   In the last century railroads were the Sandamp;Ls of their day:highly leveraged entities that spent lavishly to buypolitical clout in Washington. In 1862 the Central and UnionPacific railroads convinced Congress to subsidize thebuilding of the first transcontinental railroad to the tuneof $60 million (nearly $1 billion in today's money) and 20million acres of land.   The owners of both railroads soon realized that they couldmake far more money on construction contracts for therailroad than on shipping charges through the sparselypopulated West. And so they set up dummy companies that paidthem exorbitant building fees. The Union Pacific's front wasCredit Mobilier of America, a finance company patterned aftera French venture.   Credit Mobilier tried to cover its tracks. Its agent inCongress, Republican Rep. Oakes Ames, tendered offers of freeor discounted stock to members of Congress who would look theother way. The investment was worth it; Credit Mobilier'sowners netted a profit of at least $23 million.   After years of rumors, the scam was exposed in late 1872in the New York Sun. Its headline read: &quot;The King of Frauds:How the Credit Mobilier Bought Its Way Into Congress.&quot; Amongthose the Sun claimed had accepted Credit Mobilier stock wereVice President Schuyler Colfax, future Vice President HenryWilson, House Speaker James G. Blaine and Rep. James A.Garfield, a future president.   Both the House and Senate established committees toinvestigate the alleged bribes. A la Charles Keating, Amesdefended his bribes by saying they were the &quot;same thing asgoing into the business community and interesting the leadingbusinessmen by giving them shares.&quot;   In early 1873, the House committee cleared Speaker Blainebut recommended that several members be expelled. But on theHouse floor, arguments were raised that the alleged bribeshad taken place more than five years before and hadn'tcorrupted any election. A motion that &quot;the special committeebe discharged from the further consideration of this subject&quot;passed by a vote of 115 to 110. Rep. Ames and another memberwere censured but not expelled.   The Senate committee recommended that Sen. James Pattersonbe expelled, but his term of office expired before any actionwas taken. Perhaps Senator Cranston, who has said he won'trun again when his term expires next year, has used that caseas the legal inspiration for his own delaying tactics.   There was a move to impeach Vice President Colfax but itended when the Senate committee recommended againstimpeachment because Colfax had purchased the CreditMobilier's stock before becoming vice president. By that lineof reasoning Spiro Agnew might not have had to resign as vicepresident in 1973 for accepting bribes while he was governorof Maryland.   Despite the Washington establishment's efforts to containthe scandal's political fallout, Credit Mobilier became arallying cry for Americans disgusted with the chicanery ofthe railroads and their marriage with politicians. &quot;TheCredit Mobilier has tinged everything,&quot; an 1874 governmentreport noted.   The Republicans, then a party of corporate statism incontrol of both the White House and Congress, paid dearly forCredit Mobilier. The scandal dogged James G. Blaine a decadelater in his 1884 race for president, which he lost toDemocrat Grover Cleveland by only 26,000 votes.   Before that, in the 1874 mid-term elections, more thanone-third of Republican incumbents were defeated. The GOPlost 96 of its 203 House seats; no party before or since hasever suffered a worse proportional loss. In the Senate, thenstill elected by state legislatures, the GOP lost seven outof its 46 seats. Today, even with public disgust againstCongress at flood tide, incumbent protections make suchresults almost inconceivable.   Mark Twain was inspired by Credit Mobilier and similarscandals to co-author &quot;The Gilded Age,&quot; a wildly popularsatirical novel that resembled the &quot;Bonfire of the Vanities.&quot;Twain scholar Bryant Morey French has described the novel asTwain's weapon &quot;against the destructive power of vestedinterest . . . against a centrally controlled nationalpolitical machine.&quot;   Twain skillfully punctured the defense of those members ofWashington's elite who claimed to have been duped by CreditMobilier's agents. Anyone involved with them &quot;had to beeither a knave or a -- well, a fool -- there was no middleground.&quot; Clark Clifford, the dean of today's Washingtonpolitical fixers, may have no choice but to defend his BCCIties with an amiable dunce defense.   One of Twain's &quot;Gilded Age&quot; characters described how thelapdog congressional &quot;ethics&quot; committees of the era worked:&quot;All they need is some examples -- just a sort of sop youknow to throw to the press andamp; the people andamp; keep them quiet.&quot;The difference between Credit Mobilier -- the BCCI of the19th century -- and the Keating Five is that the currentSenate Ethics Committee can't even summon the courage to pusha political vending machine such as Alan Cranston forward asa sacrificial lamb. Even an author as cynical as Twain mighthave trouble handling the plot of today's Washingtonscandals.   ---   Mr. Fund is a Journal editorial writer.</TEXT></DOC>
