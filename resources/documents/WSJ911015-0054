USAir, parent of the nation's fourth largest carrier,reported a net loss of $81.4 million, or $2.06 a share, inthe third quarter. But that was narrower than the loss of$120 million, or $2.87 a share, it posted in the 1990 thirdquarter.</LP><TEXT>   Analysts viewed the latest figures, coupled with thecost-reduction plan, as somewhat encouraging. &quot;The feel ofthe loss was actually better than expected,&quot; said MerrillLynch andamp; Co.'s Candace Browning, who raised USAir's ratingfrom &quot;underperforming&quot; to &quot;neutral&quot; status. &quot;We think all ofthe bad news at USAir is out,&quot; she said.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, USAir stockjumped $1.125 to close at $9.125 on volume of just over onemillion shares.   The airline, which hasn't shown a quarterly profit sincethe second quarter of 1989, said revenue in the latestquarter fell 3% to $1.59 billion from $1.64 billion.   USAir may show a loss in excess of $1 billion since 1989,including a projected pretax loss of $500 million this year.While the carrier, like its competitors, has been hurt by theweak economy and effects of the Gulf War it also has beenaffected by higher-than-average costs per passenger and lowerproductivity.   &quot;We must address these issues today because they are thekey to our survival and return to profitability,&quot; said USAirPresident Seth Schofield in a statement.   USAir said at least one of its three major unions wouldhave to agree to wage-and-benefit reductions before its planfor non-contract employees takes effect. About half of thecarrier's work force is non-union.   Under USAir's plan, the first $20,000 earned bynon-contract employees of the Arlington, Va., companywouldn't be touched. However, 10% would be trimmed from thenext $30,000 of income, 15% from the next $50,000, and 20%for any amount over $100,000. Thus, an employee earning$75,000 a year would see a salary cut of $6,750. Wage cutswould last for 15 months, and would be offset by profitsharing and an option to purchase stock at $15 a share.   With all three of the airline's labor unions operatingunder expired contracts, implementation of the cost-cuttingmeasures is hardly assured.   The airline will get its first chance to press unionmembers for concessions starting tomorrow, when it isscheduled to meet with representatives of the Airline PilotsAssociation, which represents USAir's 5,000 pilots. TheInternational Association of Machinists represents 8,000USAir employees and the Association of Flight Attendantsrepresents 9,000.   The pilots' union, considered a crucial element in anyconcession talks, has said that it will agree to concessionsonly as part of a collective bargaining agreement. Thepilots' contract expired last month. Flight attendants areworking under a contract that expired in September 1989, andmachinists have been without a contract since March 1990.   &quot;We're here for the company's survival,&quot; said ArmenJanzen, USAir's pilots' union chairman. &quot;We will discuss anyand all issues.&quot;   In addition to wage givebacks, the airline is askingemployees to pay 10% of their own medical and dentalbenefits, and to allow a one-year freeze on pension accruals.USAir also said it will cut its clerical staff by 10% at theend of 1992.   In disclosing its latest quarterly loss, Mr. Schofieldmaintained, &quot;USAir is not a candidate for bankruptcy.&quot; Hesaid that the airline's liquidity will be about $1 billion atthe end of this year.   It could be needed, considering that the airline'srank-and-file might not be willing to go along fully withmanagement's requests. As one pilot, Jim McManamy said:&quot;Everyone realizes that the company is in bad shape andthey're willing to do something. I think the company is goingto get some things, but they're not going to get everythingthey're looking for.&quot;   In the first nine months, USAir's net loss widened to$306.9 million from $233.4 million a year earlier. Revenuefell to $4.8 billion from $4.9 billion. The company said itwas encouraged by a recent increase in yields, or revenue perpassenger mile, and a reduction in fuel costs.</TEXT></DOC>
