The Dow Jones industrial average tumbled 36.97 points to 2,286.07on Friday, the biggest drop in that key market indicator since Nov.16.   An accompanying decline in the bond market was more modest but itextended the losses bonds suffered in a Thursday selloff, which wasthe sharpest in three months for the credit markets.   Meanwhile, the dollar rallied on the prospect that the FederalReserve might tighten its monetary policy _ pushing interest rateseven higher _ in an effort to choke off inflation.   Separately, the nation's biggest banks boosted their primelending rates by a half percentage point to 11 percent, the highestlevel since late 1984 and a reflection of recent rises in otherrates.   Roiling the financial markets was the Labor Department's reportFriday morning that wholesale prices jumped 1 percent in January.   The increase was about twice as large as expected.   Bond prices tumbled and interest rates surged higher withinmoments of the report.   ``In the first couple of minutes, there was absolute shock,''said Elliott Platt, fixed-income research director for theinvestment firm Donaldson Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Securities. ``The marketwent down hard.''   Prices of the Treasury's 30-year bond, considered a sensitivegauge of interest rate speculation, fell $10 for every $1,000 inface value during a burst of trading after the report. Prices edgedback up later in the day in more subdued activity.   By late trading, prices of the benchmark 30-year bond were downabout $5 for every $1,000 in face value and the yield jumped to 9.03percent from 8.89 percent late Thursday.   That loss came on top of Thursday's setback that saw the price of30-year bonds sink $16.25 for every $1,000 in face value.   On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average lost 18 pointsafter the first 30 minutes of trading, recoverted somewhat at middaybut deteriorated in the afternoon to finish with a 36.97-point lossfor the day.   But the inflation report supported the dollar, which benefitsfrom speculation that the Fed will tighten credit and boost interestrates, which make the dollar more attractive to foreign investors.   By the end of trading in New York, the dollar traded at 1.8695West German marks, up from 1.8475 late Thursday, and at 128.68Japanese yen, up from 127.93 late Thursday.   President Bush's budget message to Congress on Thursday also wascited for the sour performance in the stock and bond markets, astraders faulted him for failing to propose more aggressive steps totrim the federal deficit.   ``The markets looked at it as a warmed-over version of (formerPresident) Reagan's budget. Any changes were modest and around theedges,'' said Gary Schlossberg, senior financial economist for WellsFargo Bank in San Francisco.   Friday's increase put the prime rate at its highest level sinceit reached 10.75 percent in late 1984. The last increase, from 10percent to 10.5 percent, occurred Nov. 28.   Some analysts said they expect further increases for the prime,which is a benchmark for setting interest on a variety of consumerand corporate loans such as adjustable-rate mortgages.</TEXT></DOC>
