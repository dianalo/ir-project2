It is shown that resistanceto fusion zone fracture and crack propagation kinetics at transverseshear depend considerably on a material embrittlement degree. At thatin a lower tail area values of a static crack resistance parameter K/subIIc/ for the fusion zone coincide practically with values K/sub Ic/ for15Kh2NMFA steel welded joints. It is established that phase-structuralheterogeneity of fusion zone metal affects the fracture propagation process.Fracture origin according to the shear mechanism occurs in base metalin regions of silicate inclusion concentration.</TEXT></DOC>
