Among the Democrats, solid performances by Senate Chairman Inouye of Hawaii and Maine's Mitchell would enhance their chances for future leadership posts; Georgia's Nunn gains exposure as a possible national candidate. Utah's Hatch, said to be interested in a Supreme Court job, can prove his loyalty as GOP point man for the president. But some Republicans think Virginia's lightly regarded Trible could be more hurt than helped by the visibility.    The House panel is likely to be more fractious. Top Republican Cheney of Wyoming has a set of young GOP colleagues who may be more united -- and aggressive -- than the older Democratic ranks, top-heavy with committee chairmen. But Democrat Jenkins of Georgia could emerge as an important ally for Chairman Hamilton.    Though Bush courts New Hampshire's Rudman, Dole trumps the VP by naming Rudman the ranking GOP member of the Senate panel.    U.S. OFFICIALS ROOT for higher oil prices despite possible ill effects.    They hope the OPEC meeting's outcome will raise prices into the high teens, even though such an accord might widen the trade deficit by about $1 billion per $1 increase and add slightly to inflation. &quot;It may take $16, $17, or $18 a barrel to maintain a viable oil industry in the U.S.,&quot; says Commerce Undersecretary Ortner.    Banking regulators especially keep their fingers crossed. Even an aide to Volcker, the No. 1 inflation fighter, says higher prices wouldn't be &quot;altogether bad.&quot; Comptroller of the Currency Clarke says any possible increase wouldn't be enough to rescue troubled Texas banks but will &quot;make them more attractive&quot; to possible rescuers.    EUROPE UNITES in concern at Reagan's arms-control course.    After years of urging Reagan to be more accommodating, many allies now worry he could go too far. They fear that his Reykjavik proposals and desire to divert public attention from the Iran-Contra scandal may lead to a bad deal. &quot;We want to make sure the president doesn't get another rush of blood to the head and give away the shop,&quot; a British official snaps.    But they fret that Reagan's more far-reaching positions are hard to oppose openly because of public support for arms reductions. Instead, they signal displeasure in other ways; NATO ignores Reagan's Reykjavik proposal to abolish nuclear missiles. Europeans also don't want the U.S. to eliminate medium-range missiles until the Soviets agree to limits on short-range missiles and conventional arms.    The Soviets signal they still want a deal with Reagan, but a State official believes they may &quot;let us stew in our juices for a little while&quot; first.    FIRST STEP: The U.S. slowly begins to normalize Polish relations. A joint trade council will start meeting again, and the U.S. promises to consider Poland's request for IMF money purely on economic grounds. The Poles had hoped for stronger steps but accept U.S. assurances of further help once it is clear that former Solidarity activists won't soon be behind bars again.    DEMOCRATS MANEUVER to take control of the welfare-revision issue. With Reagan likely to offer a watered-down proposal of his own, they figure they can seize the political initiative. Subcommittee Chairmen Ford in the House and Moynihan in the Senate both plan to offer major packages.    ROSTENKOWSKI SEEKS a new approach on trade legislation. Rather than revive last year's House-passed measure, the Ways and Means chairman hopes to draft a bill with a more bipartisan flavor. His reasoning: Starting off with the much-criticized 1986 bill would place Democrats at a bargaining disadvantage. He is to outline his plans in a Jan. 5 speech.    ROLE REVERSAL: Most job seekers are interviewed by prospective employers, but retiring Sen. Long turned the tables on his new law firm, Finley Kumble. Before the former Finance chairman signed on, the firm flew all its tax lawyers to Washington so he could personally interview them.    WOMEN'S GROUPS AWAIT Supreme Court rulings on major issues.    &quot;This is a very important term,&quot; says Marsha Levick, executive director of the NOW Legal Defense Fund. Several issues of concern to women's-rights groups are prominent on the court's docket, and how they are handled under new Chief Justice Rehnquist may shape the groups' legal and political strategy in coming years.    Among other things, the court will decide the first affirmative-action dispute involving sex discrimination rather than race; whether states may require that women be allowed to join Rotary clubs; whether states may give women special treatment for maternity leave; and whether states may impose a 24-hour waiting period for abortions on minor girls.    In lower courts, women's groups &quot;are still getting good results&quot; despite the growing number of Reagan-appointed judges, says NOW's Ms. Levick.    MINOR MEMOS: Asked why Shultz took time out during the Iran controversy to tour a Belgian brewery, his spokesman responds, &quot;He's been to the chocolate factories before.&quot; . . . Americans for Democratic Action sells $1 buttons reading, &quot;Did Reagan know or was he napping?&quot; . . . Queried about whether the Iran scandal might make the 1988 GOP nomination not worth having, Sen. Dole responds quickly: &quot;I'll take it.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
