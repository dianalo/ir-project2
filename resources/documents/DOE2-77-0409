<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-77-0409 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have searched for narrow resonance peaks in the process e{sup +}e{sup-}{yields}{gamma}{gamma}, utilizing a /sup 22/Na {beta}{sup +} sourceand a pair of Ge detectors to detect the final two {gamma}'s. No statisticallysignificant peak is observed at the center-of-mass energy of 1062 keV,where the heavy-ion-collision experiment at LBL has seen a peak. Theupper limit to the quantity {Gamma}/sub e//sub e/{Gamma}/sub {gamma}//sub{gamma}//{Gamma} is 1.1 x 10/sup -4/ eV at the 95% confidence level fora scalar or pseudoscalar resonance at 1062 keV/c{sup 2}. Similar upperlimits are obtained in the mass region between 1045 and 1085 keV/c{sup2}</TEXT></DOC>
