Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani also reportedfighting in three other provinces during the previous 24 hours. Hegave the casualties as 32 dead and six wounded.   At the United Nations in New York, Afghan Foreign Minister AbdulWakil on Monday said his government will retaliate against Pakistanif it does not stop supporting Afghan rebels.   He told the Security Council in a 90-minute speech, ``If theSecurity Council fails to adopt necessary measures for defusing thepresent tense situation, and if Pakistani aggression andintervention against our contry is continued, we will have nochoice but the firm and patriotic defense of our country.''   Wakil said the Pakistani side must understand that its territorywas as vulnerable to rocket attacks as Afghanistan, bombarded byrockets transported across the Afghan-Pakistan border.   None of the casualty figures reported Monday could be verified.Both the Marxist government and Moslem guerrillas generallyexaggerate the other side's losses.   Amani said guerrillas fired from two directions on Jalalabad,which they have besieged for seven weeks. He said four civilianswere killed and 12 wounded.   Soldiers returned the fire, the spokesman said, and he gaveenemy casualties as 54 killed and 35 wounded. Amani claimedPakistani and Saudi advisers were among the dead.   Two soldiers were wounded and three houses and a marrketdestroyed by the guerrilla shelling, he said.   Jalalabad is a provincial capital 75 miles east of Kabul andonce had a population of 64,000. It has been under heavy rocket andartillery attack since the siege began March 6.   Capturing it would give the insurgents a base for the exilegovernment they formed in Pakistan two months ago and help themgain momentum to for an attack on the capital. Jalalabad is nearthe Afghanistan end of the Khyber Pass, about 45 miles from thePakistan frontier.   When the offensive began, guerrilla leaders predicted Jalalabadwould fall within days, but the Afghan army is equipped withsophisticated Soviet weapons and has repulsed the attacks.Diplomats in Kabul say both sides have suffered heavy casualties.   The Soviet Union completed withdrawal of its military forcesfrom Afghanistan, under a U.N.-mediated agreement, on Feb. 15 butcontinues supplying Afghanistan's army.   Pakistan, the United States, Saudi Arabia and China are amongmajor supporters and suppliers of the insurgents, who beganfighting after a communist coup in April 1978. Soviet soldiersentered the war in December 1979 and an estimated 115,000 were inAfghanistan when the withdrawal began.   In reports Monday on the other fighting, Amani said guerrillasshelled Kandahar in the south, wounding two civilians. He saidsoldiers killed at least 27 insurgents and captured 10.   Amani said three civilians were killed in Paktia province in thesouth, and two insurgents were killed and four wounded in Herat, awetern province.   In a dispatch from Kabul on the fighting, the Soviet news agencyTass said the Afghan Foreign Ministry sent three new notes to U.N.representatives complaining of Pakistani violations of the Genevaaccords.   Tass also reported that the new Indian ambassador toAfghanistan, Muhammed Hamid Ansari, on Monday presented hiscredentials to President Najib, stressing friendly ties between theIndian and Afghan nations.</TEXT></DOC>
