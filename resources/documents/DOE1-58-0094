The consensus of the meetingwas that 70 to 75 million tons of steel per year will be supplied bythe domestic steel industry - 40 to 45 million tons by integrated producersfrom virgin iron units, and 30 to 35 million tons from scrap-based steelmaking. The potential shortage of coke in the 1990s can be partiallyalleviated by injection of natural gas into blast furnace tuyeres. Thescrap supply can support a 20 million-ton-per-year increase in scrap-basedsteel making without depleting scrap reserves. With the use of currentlyavailable scrap and existing sorting practices, high-quality steel, includingauto sheet and wire rod, can be made from scrap. As problems with controlof residual elements on a heat-to-heat basis are solved with new meltingand heat treating processes, more scrap and less pig iron will be usedand DRI's expertise will be needed. All 14 papers have been abstractedseparately for inclusion on the Energy Data Base.</TEXT></DOC>
