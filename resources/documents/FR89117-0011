The plan for achieving the secondary standardmay be submitted as part of a State's plan for achieving the primary standardor as a separate plan. The primary standard plan must provide for attainmentno later than 3 years from plan approval. Attainment of the secondary standardmust be within a reasonable time.Under section 110(c) of the Act, USEPA promulgated its substitute sulfurdioxide plan for the State of Ohio on August 27, 1976, which set emissionlimitations for Ohio sources to assure that the State of Ohio attain andmaintain the national ambient air quality standards for sulfur dioxide(SO<T2>2</T2>).See 41 FR 36324, 41 FR 52155, and 42 FR 27588. The Federal plan was designedto ensure attainment of both the primary and secondary sulfur dioxide standardswithin 3 years of plan approval.On February 9, 1978, the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuitremanded to USEPA for its further consideration two aspects of the plan.<T3>Northern Ohio Lung Association </T3>v.<T3> USEPA</T3>, 572 F.2d 1182 (6th Cir. 1978). The Court held that theplan did not comply with the requirements of Section 110(a)(2)(F) of theAct and did not include specific provisions for meeting the secondary ambientair quality standards for SO<T2>2</T2>.USEPA previously addressed the secondary standard portion of the remandon October 6, 1981 (46 FR 49123), and July 26, 1982 (47 FR 32121). Thisnotice addresses the portion of the sulfur dioxide remand regarding section110(a)(2)(F) of the Clean Air Act which requires appropriate sources tomonitor their own emissions.On January 27, 1981 (46 FR 8481), USEPA approved a significant portionof Ohio's sulfur dioxide SIP which replaced USEPA's August 27, 1976, plan.(Effective date was subsequently delayed until April 13, 1982 (47 FR 15782)).Amendments were approved by USEPA on April 20, 1982 (47 FR 16784), andMay 13, 1982 (47 FR 20586). The SO<T2>2</T2> plan in Ohio is no longer the Federal plan promulgated by USEPAbut, in most cases, is the revised State SO<T2>2</T2> plan. Therefore, Ohio submitted a revision to the SIP to satisfyboth section 110(a)(2)(F) of the Clean Air Act and 40 CFR 51.214 (previouslycodified at 40 CFR 51.19(e)) as they pertain to sulfur dioxide emissions,and to address the remand from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section 110(a)(2)(F)</ITAG>According to section 110, SIPs must require the installation of equipmentto monitor emissions from stationary sources, the periodic reporting ofsuch emissions, and the correlation of such reports with any emission limitations.To implement this provision of section 110, USEPA promulgated regulationsidentifying the minimum emission monitoring requirements (40 CFR Part 51,Appendix P). For SO<T2>2</T2>, continuous emission monitoring (CEM) is required for the followingsource categories:(1) Fossil fuel-fired steam generators greater than 250 Million BritishThermal Units per hour (MMBTU/HR) which have installed SO<T2>2</T2> pollution control equipment, and(2) Sulfuric acid plants of greater than 300 tons per day production capacity.<ITAG tagnum="85">(1) Fossil Fuel-Fired Generating Units_Ohio SIP</ITAG>Currently, there are only two fossil fuel-fired steam generating unitsgreater than 250 MMBTU/HR that have SO<T2>2</T2> pollution control equipment in Ohio: Candamp;SOE Conesville_Units5 and 6. Continuous emission monitoring of SO<T2>2</T2> for Conesville Units 5 and 6 were already installed to satisfyNew Source Performance Standards (NSPS) requirements at 40 CFR Part 60,Subpart D.On December 21, 1976 (41 FR 55575), and December 22, 1981 (46 FR 62065),USEPA delegated authority to implement NSPS to Ohio. Because Subpart D(fossil fuel-fired generators which commenced construction after August17, 1971) and Subpart Da (electric utility steam operating units whichcommenced construction after September 18, 1978) both require the installationand operation of continuous emission monitors for SO<T2>2</T2>, any new fossil fuel-fired generator greater than 250 MMBTU/HRin Ohio will be required to have continuous emission monitors.Any existing source greater than 250 MMBTU/HR not subject to NSPS whichalters its compliance method to include the use of SO<T2>2</T2> pollution control equipment must install CEM equipment consistentwith the NOLA remand. For any such source, OEPA plans to specify the monitoringrequirements as part of the source's Permit to Operate. The State mustalso submit any such CEM requirement to USEPA as a SIP revision request.Thus, all existing and future fossil fuel-fired generating units in Ohiosubject to the control requirements of Subparts D, and Da, will complywith the requirements of section 110(a)(2)(F).<ITAG tagnum="85">(2) Sulfuric Acid Plants_Ohio SIP</ITAG>As noted in a letter dated September 5, 1985, from Ohio EPA, there areonly two sulfuric acid plants with greater than 300 tons per day productioncapacity in Ohio (Coulton Chemical and E.I. duPont). This letter is containedin the docket for this proposed action.A. Coulton Chemical CompanyThe State submitted two permits to operate (identified as A-Plant and B-Plant)for the Coulton Chemical Company in Lucas County. The State requested thatTerms and Conditions listed in item 3 of the permits be incorporated intothe Ohio SIP.Condition 3 references a compliance time schedule for installing and operatingcontinuous emission monitoring equipment. The schedule requires completionof testing and calibration of installed continuous emission monitoringwithin 18 months of issuance of the permit for A-Plant and by July 3, 1987,for B-Plant. Ohio EPA requested USEPA to act on these compliance schedulesas part of Condition 3. Additionally, Condition 3 requires these facilitiesto submit quarterly reports pursuant to 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix P, Paragraph4 documenting all instances of sulfur dioxide emissions in excess of thelimitations specified in OAC Rule 3745-18-54(X). This rule is identicalto the currently effective SIP for this source as contained in 40 CFR 52.1881(b)(39)(vi)(B).USEPA finds that the continuous emission monitoring requirements for SO<T2>2</T2> in these permits satisfy 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix P.B. E.I. duPontThe State submitted a permit to operate for the E.I. duPont Fort Hill Plantin Miami. The State requested that Terms and Conditions listed in Condition3 of the permits be incorporated into the Ohio SIP. Condition 3 requiresthe source to operate and maintain existing equipment to continuously monitorand record the SO<T2>2</T2> emissions from the source as required by 40 CFR Part 60.13.Additionally, Condition 3 requires this facility to submit quarterly reportspursuant to 40 CFR Parts 60.7 and 60.84, documenting all instances of sulfurdioxide emissions in excess of the Ohio SIP. The continuous emission monitoringrequirements for SO<T2>2</T2> in these permits satisfy 40 CFR Part 51, Appendix P.As noted above, USEPA delegated authority to implement NSPS to Ohio. Because40 CFR Part 60, Subpart H requires the installation and operation of continuousemission monitors for SO<T2>2</T2>, any new sulfuric acid production unit in Ohio will be requiredto have continuous emission monitors. Thus, all existing and future applicablesulfuric acid plants in Ohio will comply with the requirements of section110(a)(2)(F).<ITAG tagnum="84">USEPA Action</ITAG>On April 30, 1986, Ohio EPA submitted a draft revision to the Ohio SIPin the form of operating permits for Coulton Chemical and for E.I. duPont.On December 24, 1986, a notice was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (51 FR 46693) proposing to approve this revision.The notice stated that in order for USEPA to approve this revision in final,the State must submit a final plan which was identical to the draft plan.On May 5, 1987, the State submitted the final plan which is in the formof operating permits for Coulton Chemical and E.I. duPont. The final operatingpermits for these facilities contain CEM requirements which are substantiallyidentical to the draft permits that USEPA proposed to approve. Additionally,no public comments were received during the public comment period on USEPA'sproposed action.USEPA is approving the requirements for SO<T2>2</T2> continuous emission monitors in the operational permits forCoulton Chemical and E.I. duPont as a revision to the Ohio SIP. These SIPrevisions, coupled with Ohio's NSPS delegation, satisfy the requirementsof section 110(a)(2)(F) for the SO<T2>2</T2> SIP and respond to the NOLA remand.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by March 20, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce its requirements. (See 307(b)(2).)
