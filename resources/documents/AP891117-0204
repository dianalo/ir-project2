Kennedy.   Her clay statue is about to be cast in bronze, the final stepbefore its unveiling outside the Massachusetts capitol as theformal memorial to a beloved native son.   For older generations, the heroic image will recall the optimismand vigor embodied by Kennedy. For generations born since the youngpresident was slain on Nov. 22, 1963, the statue offers a glimpseof the era known as Camelot.   ``My wish is to portray somebody who was a magnetic leader andwho had a lot of youth, a lot of hope about his role and thepossiblities for America,'' said McIlvain, a professor of sculptureat Boston University.   McIlvain's work, which will take about six months to cast,depicts Kennedy in a classic pose _ striding into a breeze, eyesforward, elbows bent with his left hand tucked into his suit pocket.   ``There are some people who have the carriage but they are stiffand pompous, where there's nothing stiff about Kennedy,'' said theartist, who has spent thousands of hours studying her subject. ``Ithink you can see the man's wit, the glint of humor in his eye.''   The finished $175,000 sculpture, which has been paid for throughdonations from citizens' groups and schoolchildren, is scheduledfor unveiling May 29, which would have been Kennedy's 72nd birthday.   It will be displayed outside the Statehouse near a statue ofHenry Cabot Lodge, the Republican whose son Kennedy defeated in1952 in the U.S. Senate campaign that launched his national career.   The John F. Kennedy Memorial Commission was established by thestate Legislature in 1983 to create a suitable tribute. Thecommission sponsored a yearlong competition for memorial designs,which drew 300 entries from around the country.   Judges debated the former president's stance, demeanor andwhether both coat buttons should be buttoned the way Kennedypreferred, despite the dicates of style.   History _ and McIlvain _ won after it was established Kennedyhad indeed appeared in more than 200 photographs with histwo-button coat buttoned contrary to sartorial custom.   ``I tried to catch his spirit, so it's not my thinking imposedon him as much as it's a reflection of him,'' said McIlvain, whowon the commission's approval in April 1988.   ``He was an extremely charming man, but I didn't want thesuper-polished, stereotypical person,'' she added, citing again thehand in the pocket. ``I'm sure his mother told him endlessly not todo it because it sags the pocket out, but that's the real JohnKennedy.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wednesday AMs, Nov. 22</NOTE></DOC>
