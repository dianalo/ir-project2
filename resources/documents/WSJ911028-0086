The decision came despite pleas from U.S. governmentdefense officials and companies such as Honeywell Inc. toexempt certain key products they buy from the company, JapanAviation Electronics Industry Ltd. The ban will probablyboost costs and force delays on several projects, an Americanexecutive from another company said.</LP><TEXT>   Honeywell insists it won't be hurt by the sanctions.&quot;We've worked hard to find alternate sources,&quot; said aHoneywell spokesman. &quot;To the extent that JAE was asingle-source supplier, we've moved production in-house.&quot;   But industry sources say a long list of U.S. companieswill be affected by the ban and other penalties imposed onJAEI, including Allied-Signal Inc., United TechnologiesCorp., American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., and Honeywell,too. Aside from Honeywell, none of the companies wouldcomment publicly on the ban. Some of the companies haveexplored other possibilities, such as finding alternativesuppliers or receiving technology licenses from JAEI so theycan make the parts themselves. But it isn't clear whetherthat can be done smoothly or cheaply.   &quot;I can't foretell&quot; what the impact will be on the U.S.companies dependent upon JAEI-made parts, said TakashiSuzuki, director of the Ministry of International Trade andIndustry's export control division. He said MITI felt a totalban, which takes effect Nov. 1, was necessary because thecompany &quot;violated Japanese principles about the export ofweapons.&quot;   MITI did, however, provide some relief by imposing the banfor only half of the three-year maximum allowed by law.   JAEI, which is 50.2%-owned by NEC Corp., allegedlyrepaired and shipped missle and aircrart parts -- through anAmerican intermediary -- for Iran throughout the eight-yearIran-Iraq war. Although Japan does allow the export ofcivilian goods that have some military applications, it haslong prohibited the sale abroad of weapons, particularly tocountries at war.   After MITI's announcement, JAEI apologized &quot;for causingtrouble&quot; and vowed to strengthen its export control system.About 6% of JAEI's 80 billion yen ($609.5 million) in revenuelast year came from exports.   The situation highlights the growing dependence of U.S.companies on Japanese technology. A similar problem emergedin 1987 after a Toshiba Corp. affiliate sold sensitivemilitary technology to the Soviet Union. Some congressmembers wanted to impose severe import restrictions onToshiba, but many U.S. companies dependent on the Japaneseelectronics giant's technologies lobbied against such a move.   In that case, MITI imposed a one-year export ban againstthe affiliate, Toshiba Machine Tool, the maximum allowed atthe time, but didn't restrict Toshiba itself.   The export ban is only the latest in a string of legaltroubles for the company since the transactions were firstdisclosed in July. The U.S. State Department in Septemberprohibited the sales of U.S. weapons parts and technologiesto JAEI. Japan's Defense Agency also reportedly cut offrelations with the company, a move that could hurt severalprojects, including the FSX fighter plane being co-developedby the U.S. and Japan.   Also in September, the Japanese government indicted fourtop JAEI executives for overseeing the illegal exports. AU.S. federal grand jury indicted JAEI and Aero Systems Inc.of Miami for an alleged conspiracy to transfer more than $7million in navigational equipment to Iran. The MITI sanctionswill make it all but impossible for JAEI to continue itsnormal defense business with the U.S. for the specifiedperiod. Apart from being banned from exporting goods to theU.S. and other countries, JAEI can't buy U.S. defense-relatedproducts or construct its own under license from U.S.companies because of an earlier State Department actionpenalizing the company for the alleged breach of U.S.export-license requirements.   The effect of this double whammy can't be easily measured.U.S. officials worry that the cut-off of JAEI's businesscould hurt at other levels of the U.S. defense industry. &quot;Wedon't have the degree of information to know whether certainthird-tier or fourth-tier subcontractors are criticallydependent on what JAE used to sell us,&quot; said a U.S.government expert on strategic trade.   Fighting a separate criminal action brought against it byfederal prosecutors, JAEI is challenging the right of theU.S. to prosecute a foreign company for actions that tookplace outside American legal jurisdiction. The U.S. hascharged JAEI with being part of a conspiracy to illegallytransfer U.S. defense items to Iran through Hong Kong andSingapore. Ronald Liebman, JAEI's lawyer, said the companyhasn't been compelled to enter a plea, but will argue theissue of &quot;extraterritoriality&quot; before a U.S. district courtin Washington.   ---   Eduardo Lachica in Washington contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
