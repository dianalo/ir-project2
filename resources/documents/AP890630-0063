Zhao, who sympathized with students seeking democratic reforms,was ousted as vice chairman of the State Central Military Commissionby the Chinese legislature. Deng engineered Zhao's formal removal asparty leader last weekend.   Deng wrote in a letter to the National People's Congress that``since Comrade Zhao Ziyang has committed serious mistakes, Iproposed his dismissal,'' the official Xinhua News Agency said.   President Yang Shangkun, who spent his career in the military,was reportedly seeking Zhao's post of senior vice chairman, secondonly to Deng in the military hierarchy. Yang has extensive contactsamong the military leadership, and he was a strong supporter of themartial law decree announced by Premier Li Peng in May.   Zhao fell out of favor with Deng last month for opposing martiallaw and the crackdown on the student-led democracy movement.   He was swept out of his posts with several other moderates, whowere replaced by officials backing the suppression of dissent. Zhaowas replaced as party general secretary by Jiang Zemin, a formermayor of Shanghai who quickly put down protests in his own city.   Zhao, 69, was last seen when he made a tearful speech to studentson a hunger strike in Beijing's Tiananmen Square on May 19.   Martial law was imposed in Beijing the next day. On June 3-4, theChinese army swept into Tiananmen Square.   Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong told Congress today that more than 200civilians, including 36 college students, were killed. He also saiddozens of soldiers died, the official Xinhua news agency reported.   Earlier, the government said 200 to 300 people, about half ofthem soldiers, had died in the military crackdown. Chinese witnessesand Western intelligence had estimated about 3,000 people werekilled.   Chen also reported that 3,000 civilians were injured, in additionto 6,000 soldiers and police.   He said more than 1,000 army trucks, 60 armored cars, and 120buses sustained $350 million in damages.   The Congress opened its session Thursday, hailing the CommunistParty's violent suppression of the democracy movement as ``legal,correct and necessary.''   Today, China renewed attacks on foreign countries it said weretrying to isolate it for suppressing the movement.   State media said Premier Li dismissed international criticism ofthe crackdown.   ``China has also noticed an anti-China ... current,'' Li told theforeign minister of Sao Tome and Principe, an island nation off WestAfrica. ``Under the banner of human rights, these people have madeunwarranted accusations of China for its quelling of thecounterrevolutionary rebellion and punishment of criminals accordingto law.''   President Yang told a visiting delegation from Bolivia onThursday that he hoped the world ``will understand that thesuppression of the rebellion represents a reasonable act in handlingour internal affairs,'' the state-run China Daily reported.   ``No ruling party or government will allow the subversion ofitself,'' Yang said.   The government also lashed out Thursday at the European EconomicCommunity for making ``presumptuous accusations'' against China.   The 12-nation EEC on Tuesday condemned what it called the``brutal repression taking place in China.'' It called for anembargo on arms sales and urged the World Bank to postpone new loans.   The United States, Canada, Japan, Australia and other countrieshave already taken similar steps against Beijing.   In Washington, the U.S. House of Representatives voted 418-0Thursday to endorse the cutoff of military aid already ordered byPresident Bush. But it also voted to suspend trade and developmentprograms, ban the sale of police equipment and limit transfer ofhigh-technology and nuclear materials.   The House provision is part of a foreign aid bill that the Senatestill must consider.   China has faced increasing isolation within the internationalcommunity as authorities continue to arrest people who supported themass protests for greater political freedom that began in mid-April.   Since the military crackdown, at least 1,800 people have beenarrested and 27 executed.</TEXT></DOC>
