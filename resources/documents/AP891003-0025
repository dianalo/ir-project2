The state's education commissioner, who had defended thefinancing system, called for a tax increase so poorer districts can``equalize upward.'' But Gov. Bill Clements said more money won'tnecessarily solve the problem.   Monday's unanimous 9-0 decision by the Texas Supreme Court found``glaring disparities'' between rich and poor school districts,violating a requirement in the state Constitution for an``efficient system'' of public schools.   The court said financing for Texas' 3.3 million students must beoverhauled by May.   ``A remedy is long overdue,'' Justice Oscar Mauzy's opinionsaid. ``The Legislature must take immediate action.''   Clements said he will call a special 30-day session of theLegislature in the spring to grapple with the problem after a taskforce still to be named makes its recommendations.   The court said it would not tell the Legislature how to correctthe inequities or order it to increase taxes, but warned: ``ABand-Aid will not suffice; the system itself must be changed.''   The state, whose school system follows California as thenation's largest, will make nearly $10 billion available for publicschools in 1990-91, and almost $12 billion is expected from localdistricts.   But because of disparities in property wealth, annual spendingper student among districts ranges from $2,112 to $19,333, thecourt said. Schools are funded with local property taxes and stateaid.   In 1988, Comptroller Bob Bullock found 730 of the 1,100districts spend less than the statewide average of $3,290 perstudent per year. The average in those districts was $2,976.   An Austin state district judge had declared the systemunconstitutional in a 1984 case brought by poor districts againststate Education Commissioner W.N. Kirby and others. That ruling wasoverturned last December by a 2-1 vote of the Austin-based 3rdCourt of Appeals.   But the high court found ``the state's school financing systemis neither financially efficient, nor efficient in the sense ofproviding for a `general diffusion of knowledge' statewide.''   The ruling prompted celebrations in Edgewood Independent SchoolDistrict in San Antonio, the lead plaintiff.   ``We took on the state of Texas and we beat 'em,'' saidSuperintendent James Vasquez.   About 1,800 students and teachers rallied at the Edgewoodstadium, holding banners reading ``Victory'' and ``Edgewood All theWay'' as a band played. A marquee at the entrance read, ``TexasChildren 9, Kirby 0.''   The ruling ``is going to mean a chance at equality,'' saidattorney Al Kauffman with the Mexican American Legal Defense andEducational Fund, who represented Edgewood and several otherdistricts.   Demetrio Rodriguez, who launched a fight for equal schoolfunding in 1968 that reached the U.S. Supreme Court before it wasrejected, said he cried when he heard of the ruling: ``It really issomething that has been in my heart.''   Kirby said that although his position as education commissionerrequired him to defend the financing system in court, he had alwaysmaintained it was inadequate.   ``We simply must have bold leadership to make the tough decisionof increasing revenue so that we equalize upward ... to the levelof a quality education for all children,'' Kirby said.   The governor was more cautious, though.   ``It could be that we maybe need more money, but money in itselfis not the answer to public education,'' Clements said. ``Qualityeducation is the issue here.''   Attorney Earl Luna, who represented several affluent districtsthat intervened in support of the state, expressed disappointment.   ``We were hoping the court would consider it as a legislativeproblem and ... hold that, while the legislative solution was notperfect, it was constitutional,'' Luna said.   In its ruling, the court rejected arguments that reform inschool finance will reduce local control of education.   ``An efficient system will actually allow for more localcontrol, not less,'' the court said. ``It will provideproperty-poor districts with economic alternatives that are not nowavailable to them.''   The opinion noted that similar rulings have been made in nineother states. Texas is one of 11 states where school financingsystems have been challenged.   Other states with active lawsuits or court orders concerningschool finance are Alaska, Connecticut, Indiana, Kentucky,Minnesota, Montana, New Jersey, North Dakota, Oregon and Tennessee.</TEXT></DOC>
