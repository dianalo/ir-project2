The Senate Labor Committee on Thursday unanimously approved hernomination after a 2{-hour hearing in which Mrs. Dole outlined apolicy to provide workers with the jobs and skills of the future.   While the former Transportation secretary and wife of SenateMinority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., credited the past six years ofuninterrupted economic growth for reducing the nation's jobless rateto a 14-year low, she said that is not enough for the future.   ``The mission of the Labor Department must be to coordinate astrategy of growth plus _ growth plus policies to help those forwhom the jobs of the future are now out of reach because of a skillsgap, family pressures or lack of supportive policies,'' she said.   Citing an aging labor force growing at a rate of only 1 percent ayear with a shrinking supply of teenage workers, Mrs. Dole said thefuture offers unprecedented opportunities and challenges.   ``We have within our reach the fulfillment of a long-awaiteddream _ that every American who wants a job can have a job,'' shesaid.   But to do it, she said, will require a coordinated effort bygovernment, business, union, education and community leaders ``towipe out illiteracy and enhance skills through basic education,training and retraining.''   Mrs. Dole, 52, was picked by Bush on Christmas Eve to be the onlywoman in his Cabinet, a role she also held in President Reagan'sadministration as transportation secretary from 1983 until October1987.   Both she and Labor Secretary William Brock resigned from theCabinet then to help her husband's campaign against Bush for the GOPpresidential nomination. Reagan then tapped Ann McLaughlin for thelabor post, where she filled a like role as the only woman in hisCabinet the last 13 months of his administration.   The committee's chairman, Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., saidhe expects Mrs. Dole's formal nomination, which will be submitted byBush just after his inauguration today, to be voted on by the fullSenate next week. Aides said Senate leaders were looking at Jan. 25as a possible date.   During her hearing Thursday, Mrs. Dole successfully duckedseveral questions on the social legislative initiatives Democratsare likely to use to test Bush's promise of a ``kinder and gentlerAmerica.''   ``I share your concern and look forward to working with you onthat issue'' was her answer to a wide variety of questions fromsenators trying to pin her down on the minimum wage, parentalleaves, child care, health insurance and pension issues.   But she indicated she would follow the lead of her predecessor in``encouraging progressive work-family policies on the part ofbusinesses and unions _ rather than mandating solutions to thelowest common denominator.''</TEXT></DOC>
