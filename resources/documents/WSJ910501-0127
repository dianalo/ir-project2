The prisoners were to be released by April 30 under anagreement between Mr. Mandela's African National Congress andthe government.</LP><TEXT>   In a speech delivered to an overflow crowd at City Hall,Mr. Mandela said the ANC's National Executive Committee hadnot yet decided how to respond to the continued imprisonmentof political prisoners, but he did not say, as other ANCofficials have on previous occasions, that the process ofANC-government negotiations would be in jeopardy if the April30 deadline was not met.   Mr. Mandela said the government is provoking mass actionby not releasing the prisoners. &quot;{President F.W.} de Klerkmust understand that if we take this demand to the streets,there are more and more people who will understand that it isreasonable and support us. The people will put this processback on track.&quot;   Anti-apartheid groups say about 1,000 political prisonersremain in jail. There may be another 1,000 politicalprisoners who haven't been given that designation, accordingto the non-governmental Human Rights Commission.   But government officials say they have met theirresponsibilities regarding release of political prisoners andestimate the number remaining is below 200. Although April 30generally has been regarded as a deadline since an Augustagreement was reached between the ANC and the government,government officials recently began calling it a &quot;targetdate.&quot; The agreement says &quot;the latest date envisaged for thecompletion of the total task . . . is not later than 30 April1991.&quot;   On another subject, Mr. Mandela dealt briefly with the ANCeconomic program, saying &quot;we accept that any form ofredistribution of wealth should not be at the expense ofeconomic growth.&quot; He called for unspecified incentives todevelop manufacturing.</TEXT></DOC>
