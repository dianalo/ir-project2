 Hosts are the computers in which these processes occur.andP;  Networksconnect the hosts together.andM;This logical structure simplifies moving data between hosts, regardless ofwhether they are large mainframes or simple local area network servers.andM;The DOD communications model contains four independent layers, the first ofwhich is the network access layer.andP;  This layer moves data between a host andthe network to which it is attached.andM;In the netowrk access layer, X.25 is the packet switching protocol underwhich information can flow over a wide area network containing several hosts.andO;IEEE 802 protocols do the same thing in an Ethernet or Token-Ring LAN.andM;The second layer of the DOD model, the internet layer, routes informationbetween networks under the Internet Protocol (IP).andP;  Access-layer protocolsreside only in the hosts, but those at the internet layer must reside in boththe hosts and the network gateways.andM;The best way to transfer data reliably between two hosts is to move blocksdirectly from one host to the other.andP;  Because that can go on independently ofother processes, it happens in a special layer called the host-to-host layer.andO;An example of a protocol at this layer is the Transmission Control Protocol(TCP).andM;Finally, once data gets to the host or a remote user has connected, the datamust be processed or an application must be executed.andP;  This happens at thefinal layer of the DOD model, the process layer.andP;  Within it are protocols forE-mail, remote log-ons and host-bound applications.andM;If data is to move between two hosts on different networks, each of whichuses a different network access protocol, the data must go through a gatewaythat can handle the two dissimilar protocols.andM;The data package contains the network access protocols for both networks.andP;  Italso must contain the Internet Protocol to function at the destination host.andM;The sending host need not know anything more than the address of thedestination host.andP;  The sending host puts its data on its own network with theappropriate network access protocol.andP;  The network, under instructions fromthe sending host, routes the data to a gateway.andP;  The gateway sends the datato the receiving network, which then routes it to the receiving host.andM;Connecting Host-to-HostandM;In this step-by-step fashion, it is possible to connect hosts on the samenetwork regardless of the distances involved, or to connect hosts ondifferent networks.andM;The mechanism are similar.andP;  However, it is necessary to invoke differentlayers of the model and to use the right protocols at the right times.andP;  Thatjob belongs to briges, gateways and related products such as repeaters androuters.andM;Bridges provide no protocol conversion but gateways do.andP;  A gateway moves dataonto a network; a bridge makes protocols transparent.andM;To connect an Ethernet LAN to a Token-Ring LAN, a bridge must be able torecognize both protocols and carry the data so that each network always seesthe data in its appropriate format.andP;  The bridge does this by functioning at alower level of the seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection model, from whichthe four-layer DOD model comes.andM;To move data across the country on an X.25 network, a gateway simply bundlesup data in an acceptable format and then unbundles it at the other end.andP;  Ifthe sending and receiving hosts are dissimilar, the gateway needs helpdealing with those dissimilarities.andP;  The less dissimilarity, the higher theOSI levels the gateways can access.andM;If no dissimilarity were present at all connection could occur at the OSIapplication, or highest layer.andP;  This type of connection would be veryefficient with no protocol translation required.andM;Repeaters, which operate at the OSI physical, or lowest layer, do nothingexcept regenerate the electrical signal between two cable segments on thesame network.andM;Routers connect different networks operating under the same protocol.andP;  Theironly function is to know the address of the source and destination networks.andM;The DOD communications model's Transmission Control Protocol providesservices to other protocols, known as &quot;transport users.&quot;andP;  The servicesinclude routing, transmission quality control, security and assigningpriorities of messages.andM;The first of the transport users is the File Transfer Protocol.andP;  FTP movesblock of data between hosts.andP;  The second is the Simple Mail TransferProtocol, the basis for most electronic mail between separate systems.andP;  Thethird transport user is Telnet, a protocol that links terminals toapplications.andM;Armed with an understanding of these concepts and protocols, governmentorganizations can design network links of diverse sorts: LAN-to-mainframegateways; LAN-to-public data network gateways or bridges; LAN-to-WAN bridges;and Ethernet LAN-to-LAN bridges.andM;Many networking products are available for such applications.andP;  Arepresentative sample appears below.andM;One of the commonest WAN Function is to connect a LAN with an externalmainframe host so that PCs can act as terminals for batch remote job entry orfile tranfers.andP;  The IBM Corp. protocol for this type of connection is knwonas SNA/SDLC (Syncrhonous Data Link Control of Systems Network Architecture).andM;Two examples of products in this category are the G/SNA Gateway from GatewayCommunications Inc. Irvine, Calif., and the Sync Presentation ConversionServer from Syn Research in Tustin, Calif.andM;G/SNA Gateway connects Novell Inc. or NetBIOS LANs to IBM mainframes.andO;Although called a gateway, it has bridge capabilities.andP;  It contains IBM 3270and 3770 terminal emulators but does not perform bridge-like protocolconversion.andP;  It simply allows a PC to emulate an IBM terminal and thenpackages the data for transmission to the host.andM;Universial ConnectionsandM;The Sync product lets IBM and Unisys Corp. terminals and emulatingworkstations connect universally to IBM and Unisys hosts.andP;  It does therequired protocl conversion and therefore is a bridge instead of a gateway.andO;Any terminal using of the supported protocols can connect transparently toany supported host.andM;The next most common application involves connecting LANs via a Public DataNetwork (PDN) such as McDonnell Douglas Network Systems Co.'s Tymnet, or aprivate X.25 network, using the X.25 packet switching protocol.andM;That calls for a LAN-to-PDN gateway.andP;  Also, the data must be readied fortransmission.andP;  Finally, dissimilar LANs at the opposite ends of the datacarrier must be able to communicate over a bridge.andM;An example of a product in this category is the G/X25 Gateway and Bridge fromGateway Communications Inc., Irvine, Calif.andP;  It can connect any NovellNetWare or NetBIOS LAN to an X.25 PDN, as well as internetwork LANs and hostsover dial-up or leased point-to-point circuits, private data networks andPDNs.andP;  The gateway assembles and disassembles the packets, while the bridgecarries on LAN communication.andM;To connect LANs with a single wide area network, several possibilities areavailable besides an X.25 gateway.andP;  One choice is to dedicate a set of linesand build a WAN with the TransLAN from Vitalink Communications Corp. inFremont, Calif.andM;TransLAN connects Ethernet IEEE 802.3 standard LANs over dedicated lines intoa single 802.3 WAN.andM;For links to an X.25 network, the TransLAN connects with a product calledTransLink.andM;Remote users can connect to the LAN/WAN as if they were local.andP;  And becauseof the X.25 protocol, remote users can take advantage of public data networkssuch as Tymnet.andM;The WAN, no matter how geographically dispersed, behaves to users like anEthernet LAN.andM;Under different protocols, the WAN's component LANs might contain, forinstance, Digital Equipment Corp., IBM and NCR Corp. hosts.andP;  It also canconnect with hosts using TCP/IP as the internet protocol.andM;Most of the time, organizations need to connect their LANs to other networks.andO;But sometimes they also need to break a too-large LAN into subnetworks.andM;IB routing bridges from 3Com Corp. in Santa Clara, Calif., exemplify productsthat combine routing and bridging functions to connect LANs into anorganizationwide network, or to subdivide LANs that have grown too large.andO;Bridges are easy to use and protocol-transparent.andP;  Routers handle separatelogical networks and deal with complex topologies.andM;Peter Stephenson is a free-lance writer for computer publications.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
