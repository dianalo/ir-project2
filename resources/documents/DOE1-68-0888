<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-68-0888 </DOCNO><TEXT>The ozonolyses of 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene and 1,2-, 1,3-, 1,4-, and2,3-dimethylnaphthalene were performed in dilute aqueous solution, andthe resulting nonperoxidic products were extracted, concentrated, andidentified. Identification of the ozonolysis products was confirmed bycomparison of retention indexes and mass and infrared spectroscopy datawith those from authentic samples when possible. The compound identificationswere facilitated by comparisons with products from parallel ozonolysisreactions performed in n-hexane and methanol at higher concentrations.The aqueous ozonolysis of 1-methyl-naphthalene yielded four major products:2-acetylbenz-aldehyde due to the cleavage of two double bonds and (E)-and (Z)-3-(2-acetylphenyl)-2-butenal and (Z)-3-(2-acetyl-phenyl)propenaldue to the cleavage of a single double bond. The products resulting fromthe ozonolysis of 2-methylnaphthalene and the isomeric dimethyl-naphthaleneswere analogous to those formed for 1-methylnaphthalene. 40 references,4 figures, 6 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
