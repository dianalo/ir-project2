 Simmons' first ninemonths has been devoted to reorganizing and consolidatingfollowing more than two years of department cuts.andP;  His goal is tobanish Bank of America's reputation as a technological lightweightand to create a sense of cooperative mission between his staff andthe bank's various users.andP;  The transport telecommunicationsbackbone network, called California Data Network (CDN), willaccommodate very wide bandwidth and dynamic routing.andP;  Simmons'goal is to trim from the current 66 data networks being supportedto as few discrete networks as possible.andP;  The CDN is to be thecommunications link for 16,000 IBM PS-2 microcomputers now beinginstalled which are to be open-ended workstation platformsflexible to changes in the business.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   Bank of America (management).andO;Topic:     BankingManagementAutomationMISNetworksInterview.andO;Feature:   illustrationportrait.andO;Caption:   Michael Simmons (portrait)Person:    Simmons, Michael (management).andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>A New IS Mission and Vision Is Born at BankAmericaandM;Nine months into his job as executive vice president and director ofBankAmerica Systems Engineering (BASE), the energetic and enthusiasticMichael Simmons is infusing new life and a new sense of purpose into thedemoralized and downsized IS operation of the California-based financialfirm.andP;  Leaving in a huff his post as president of Fidelity InformationServices Co., the 49-year-old exec quickly transferred his technology talentsfrom Boston to the shores of San Francisco Bay.andP;  It's here at the the $726million BankAmerica Corp. that Simmons' famous folksy analogies take on newmeaning and where the man himself can do what he does best: get IS down tothe business of the business.andM;How would you characterizeandM;your first nine months atandM;BankAmerica?andM;I have been rebuilding the organization.andP;  We [BankAmerica SystemsEngineering] have gone through a severe downsizing during the prior 2-1/2years.andP;  We've just gotten stabilized and we're now on the comeback trail.andO;It's time to get the right people in the right places and get them trained todo some things we would like to do.andM;What are &quot;some things&quot; on theandM;Simmons agenda?andM;I have a list of some 20 Key projects that we're working on.andP;  We've placedextra emphasis on two of those projects--one to replace our teller system andone to build a transport telecommunications backbone network that we call theCalifornia Data Network (CDN).andP;  The network will accommodate very widebandwidth and have dynamic routing for reliability and availability.andM;We have 66 discrete data networks today.andP;  We're trying to trim those networksdown.andP;  In a perfect world, we'd like to get as close to one as possible.andP;  Sofar, ISDN in the U.S.andP;  is not that much of a reality.andP;  We'll probably do morewith ISDN at one of our 10 offshore data centers before we do a lot with ithere in the States.andM;Could you describe this new on-lineandM;teller system?andM;TandM;The CDN is the transport mechanism for the on-line teller network that willconsist of 16,000 PS/2s.andP;  They are going in right now.andP;  We startedinstallation of the PS/2s last year and we will probably finish in mid-1990.andO;The PS/2 is the primary workstation platform.andP;  but we also support otherthings such as the Macintosh that can interface with our network via  astandard interface.andM;The PS/2 is a good platform.andP;  It gives us the flexibility we need becausefive years from now we may be in a different kind of business, offeringdifferent kinds of services.andP;  So you want to be able to have an open-endedworkstation so that you can offer the customer standing in front of youwhatever service that customer wants.andP;  And if you don't do that withprogrammability, you won't get there from here.andM;How are you helpingandM;BankAmerica change itsandM;antiquated technology image?andM;That's part of my project list.andP;  For example, we are replacing our consumerloan system and our teller terminals because we need open-ended platforms forfuture products and also because we need to upgrade from 1974 technology.andO;And we're consolidating our data networks.andP;  This is like skin replacement onthe body.andP;  It's a continual process, but you don't replace things that areworking and are not an inhibiting factor.andP;  You selectively replace things.andM;Explain the &quot;technology models&quot;andM;BankAmerica plans toandM;Standardize on.andP;  Will they carryandM;The company beyond the '90s?andM;They are platforms.andP;  Take the workstation platform, for example.andP;  I have aphilosophy that the responsibility of the information management facility isto provide professionals at the workstation with the tools they need to dotheir jobs better.andP;  If you adopt this approach, then you've got to divide thedelivery mechanism into platforms--workstation, software, hardware, andtransport.andP;  Then you can change any one of those elements without affectingthe balance of those elements.andP;  I hope these platforms carry us beyond the'90s.andP;  If they only make it 10 years, then we wouldn't have done a very goodjob.andM;What are your long-term goals forandM;the BASE operation?andM;One thing I'm trying to do is simplify the mission and get a vision of wherewe're going--a vision that everybody in the organization can understand.andP;  I'mtrying to get us out of playing an elitist role and into a role as a businesspartner so that we can more effectively support the business units' marketingstrategy.andP;  I use the following analogy to get this message across to my ISstaff.andP;  I tell them that if they consider all the people who come to them fordp services as clients, then they're like a person standing on a piershouting directions to a guy who's out in a small dinghy that's sinking.andO;Instead, I want them all in the boat with that business partner so that theycan work together for common solutions that best support their strategies ina cost-effective manner.andP;  That's the view of the situation they should have,that's my vision, and we're moving toward it.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
