Under the arrangement, Meese is trying to settle thelongstanding feud by having acting Associate Attorney GeneralFrancis Keating arbitrate individual disagreements over whether theFBI or Marshals Service will handle a particular fugitiveinvestigation.   The Marshals Service has been increasingly successful under a1979 agreement with the FBI in tracking down fugitives, but the FBIhas said the marshals have expanded their role too far.   Sources at the FBI and Marshals Service, speaking on conditionof anonymity, said little appears to have changed under Meese'sdecision and that the main alteration has been to set up a disputemechanism in the associate attorney general's office.   Meese told FBI Director William Sessions last week the bureaugenerally retains jurisdiction of tracking down escapees who fledafter being arrested but before going to trial, said JusticeDepartment spokesman Terry Eastland.   Meese told Marshals Service chief Stanley Morris that his agencyretains jurisdiction over the apprehension of fugitives who escapedafter being convicted, Eastland said.   Under Meese's decision, the FBI generally would havejurisdiction over all fugitives _ whether in the pre- orpost-conviction phase _ involved in foreign counterintelligencecases, organized crime or terrorism.   But if the Marshals Service has made major progress on afugitive case, it might ask to assist or take over an FBI fugitiveinvestigation, said Eastland.   In addition, the FBI may ask the Marshals Service to turn overjurisdiction over an investigation involving a fugitive who hasbeen convicted but who has committed new crimes after fleeing.   The sources said the attorney general's decision leaves the dooropen, contingent on the approval of the associate attorneygeneral's office, for the Marshals Service to continue aggressivepursuit in the types of investigations that led to the apprehensionof Edwin Wilson.   Wilson is an ex-CIA official who was sought for training Libyanterrorists and supplying them with explosives. The marshals luredWilson to the Dominican Republic and put him on a flight to theUnited States, where he was arrested.</TEXT></DOC>
