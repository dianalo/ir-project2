The action was seen as an escalation of a U.S.-Canadian disputeover Canadian fish export regulations.   Crosbie said in a statement that Canada has lost patience withU.S. failure to comply with a 1987 ruling by the General Agreementon Tariffs and Trade that the so-called Superfund oil tax _ a taximposed to help pay for environmental protection _ violates worldtrade rules.   The move came two days after U.S. Trade Representative CarlaHills said the United States will retaliate against regulationsthat protect Canada's West Coast herring- and salmon-processingindustry.   ``I would call it a tit-for-tat move,'' said one U.S. official,who spoke on the condition of not being identified.   Spokeswoman Danielle Ayotte of the External Affairs Department,however, denied any linkage between the disputes. She said nodecision has been made on what U.S. products may be affected bysanctions.   She said the oil dispute came up when Hills and Crosbie met inWashington this month, but that there was no movement on the U.S.side.   ``It has been going on for a long time. I think we have beenvery patient,'' she said.   Ayotte said Canada had no option but to seek formal authorityfrom GATT to remove U.S. trading privileges. The sanctions probablywould comprise tariffs or quotas on U.S. products. It could takemonths before they could go into effect.   Crosbie expressed hope that Washington would act before thathappened, saying, ``Our preference is that the United States removethis discriminatory tax. We are not interested in retaliatoryaction for its own sake.''   But a U.S. official, also insisting on anonymity, said Canada isirritated that Washington acted to retaliate against Canadian fishproducts without approval by the Geneva-based, 96-nation GATTorganization, and could be out to teach the United States a lesson.   Crosbie chided the Americans on Wednesday for acting under U.S.trade law before getting approval from GATT.   Canada says it will replace the export restrictions on rawherring and salmon with new conservation regulations that willconform to GATT.   The United States imposed the oil tax in 1986 as part of theU.S. Superfund to finance a multibillion-dollar war chest forenvironmental cleanup.   Although Canada supported the principle of the Superfund, itcomplained to GATT because the U.S. tax on imported oil was 11.7cents per barrel while the tax on oil produced in the United Stateswas only 8.2 cents.   The tax adds $8.37 million a year to the cost of oil importedfrom Canada, and Canada would be allowed to impose sanctions of thesame value.   Hans Maciej, vice president of the Canadian PetroleumAssociation in Calgary, said he didn't know if this was ``the rightbullet to use.'' The Bush administration has been working to getCongress to comply with the GATT ruling anyway, he said.   However, he said the Superfund tax isn't a critical issue forCanadian oil exporters. ``It's an irritant.''</TEXT></DOC>
