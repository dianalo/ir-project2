Manuel Noriega had been killed.   Mary Rebhan, 24, of Hollywood, Fla., and Tara King, 25, ofDallas, told reporters they were used as shields to buy time for agroup of Noriega loyalists who holed up in a sweltering customsroom at Omar Torrijos International Airport when American forcesmoved in.   ``They had us in choke holds for most of the time,'' said Rebhan.   ``They made us kneel down and held guns to my back and to herhead,'' said King.   The two women said they had gone to the airport Tuesday eveningto pick up Rebhan's brother, who was flying in for her weddingceremony at the end of the month.   They were told his flight was delayed, and went outside to waitin the car _ until about 12:30 a.m. Wednesday when the bombsstarted to drop.   Dashing inside the terminal, the women were accosted by a groupof about 30 armed men in civilian clothes. When it was revealed thewomen were Americans, they were taken to a locked room.   ``A guy named Sanchez was in charge,'' Rebhan said, adding thattwo other men were addressed throughout the night as ``sarjinto,''or sergeant, leading the women to believe they were members of thePanamanian Defense Forces.   American troops began to arrive in force to take over theairport but the Panamanians held them off with the women.   ``For six hours they made us keep shouting, `Go away. We'reAmericans. They're going to kill us and the children if youcome,''' Rebhan said.   Fake bombs were taped to their bodies. One was a plastic bagstuffed with a pair of pants.   King said their captors turned the lights off in the room toconfuse the Americans. Rebhan said Sanchez kept an Uzi machine gunon her shoulder, pointed at the door.   The woman, who were both raised in the canal zone, acted astranslators between the Americans and Panamanians.   Just before dawn, the Americans set a deadline of 6:30 for themen to surrender and told them they were surrounded and that Gen.Noriega was already dead. In fact, Noriega's whereabouts were notknown.   The Panamanians finally gave up, leaving the room with the womenheld in front of them.   ``They were really afraid. We could feel their hearts on ourbacks as they held us,'' Rebhan said.   But the women said they were at least equally frightened.   ``We were terrified,'' King said. ``I thought I was going todie.''   Rebhan, speaking on the airport tarmac before hitching a ridewith a Pentagon press pool, said she was acting calmly because ``itreally hasn't hit me yet. I just really want to get home.''   Rebhan, whose father is the chief mechanical engineer for thePanama Canal, said she planned to hold a church ceremony in Panamaon Dec. 30. She was married to Jeff Rebhan in a civil ceremony inWarren, Ohio.</TEXT></DOC>
