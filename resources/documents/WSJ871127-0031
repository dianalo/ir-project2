Perry and David ShribmanStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> FRESTNUCLEAR POWER, FUEL (NUK)AEROSPACE (ARO)EXECUTIVE (EXE) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former Secretary of State Alexander Haig attacked the almost-completed missile accord with the Soviet Union because it would prevent the U.S. from developing conventional Cruise missiles to defend Western Europe against Warsaw Pact tanks.    He also criticized George Bush, both for his performance as vice president and for what Mr. Haig portrayed as his lack of presidential qualifications.    The Republican presidential candidate said the proposed missile treaty, the final details of which were hammered out this week in Geneva, is &quot;a distortion of strategic reality.&quot; Nevertheless, he said, political reality dictates that it should be ratified. But he advocated that the Senate adopt major changes to make the eventual treaty less objectionable.    He told Wall Street Journal reporters and editors at a luncheon Wednesday that U.S. allies already are nervous about eliminating medium and short-range nuclear missiles in Europe. Scrubbing the agreement, he added, would be politically &quot;impossible&quot; now. One way to improve it, he said, would be to reserve the right, after half the missiles have been destroyed, to keep the rest in place if a broader arms agreement on strategic nuclear weapons hadn't been reached. But that is an amendment the Soviets would be unlikely to accept.    Especially troubling to Mr. Haig, a former commander of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, is language agreed to on Tuesday in the proposed treaty that prohibits either side from deploying new ground-launched missiles, nuclear or conventional. These highly accurate missiles, with conventional warheads, could be used to destroy &quot;assembly areas&quot; for the Warsaw Pact's huge tank force, he said.    He said neither Secretary of State George Shultz nor Vice President George Bush &quot;understands strategic reality.&quot; Mr. Haig described President Reagan as a &quot;romanticist,&quot; which, he said, explains the president's fascination for the anti-missile shield commonly called &quot;Star Wars.&quot;    But Mr. Haig, running in the back of the GOP presidential pack, directed his sharpest criticism to Vice President Bush, the front-runner in national polls. He promised that in the weeks ahead he will open up a barrage of criticism against the vice president. &quot;Believe me,&quot; he said, &quot;I'm going to pick the time and place.&quot; He said he doesn't feel bound to observe the so-called 11th commandment -- that a Republican candidate should never speak ill of another Republican candidate.    He suggested that Mr. Bush's support is not firm, even though he has &quot;made every patronage appointment that has a political connotation&quot; in his six years in the White House. &quot;He had his son down there in Miami and every time the Cuban community belched they got an answer right from the head chef.&quot;    But he wasn't sure it would work for the vice president. &quot;I happen to believe George Bush is accident-prone,&quot; Mr. Haig said. &quot;I think George Bush will be George Bush before it's over.&quot;    &quot;I don't think this man is the man to lead this country,&quot; he said, adding that this assessment &quot;is not based on emotion or subjectivity but on cold-headed observation over an extended period of time.&quot;    Mr. Haig said that when he was secretary of state negotiating a peace settlement in Lebanon, Vice President Bush and then-Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger &quot;were over telling the Arabs 180 degrees different&quot; from what Mr. Haig was saying. He said those two officials &quot;totally blew&quot; a peace settlement in Lebanon.    Peter Teeley, Mr. Bush's communications director, disputed Mr. Haig's account: &quot;The vice president would not have undercut the efforts of the secretary of state,&quot; he said. Mr. Weinberger said he has &quot;absolutely no idea what Mr. Haig is talking about.&quot; He said the comment sounded like &quot;the standard political statement by a candidate who knows that he is running behind.&quot;    On the matter of Cubans now rebelling in two federal prisons, Mr. Haig described the way the situation should have been handled when they first arrived in the U.S. He said he would have &quot;put them all in straitjackets and helicoptered them late at night down to a port in Miami and escorted them back in an old scow with the Atlantic fleet, telling Mr. {Fidel} Castro 'we're returning your illegal entries and if you take any action it's an act of war.'&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
