Baker III said Wednesday.   ``We will have to look at the possibility of increasing numbersand of increasing dollars'' for the refugee program, Baker said athis confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign RelationsCommittee.   In addition, Baker said, the problem of the glut of refugees infirst-asylum countries _ the places they gather after leaving theirhomelands to await permanent moves _ ``will occupy our time andattention'' early in the new administration.   Baker's comments came as he underwent a second day of friendlyquestioning on his nomination to lead the State Department in thenew administration. The full committee was expected to vote toapprove his appointment on Thursday, and the Senate was scheduled tomeet Jan. 25 to act on that and other nominations.   On other subjects:   _Responding to questions about two long-pending treaties with theSoviet Union, Baker said agreement is complete on verificationprocedures for the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty andnearly complete on verification rules for the 1974 Nuclear Test BanTreaty.   The two will be sent together to the Senate for ratification,Baker said, but he declined to say when.   _Baker said he had reservations about U.S. participation in ascheduled 1991 international human rights conference in Moscow, buthe added, ``We made a commitment and we plan to keep it'' so long asconditions for improvements in Soviet human rights performance aremet.   _Asked how he interprets changes being made by Soviet LeaderMikhail Gorbachev, in regard to the Soviet Union's approach to therest of the world, Baker said, ``The jury is still out. That's why... we should approach our relationship with prudence and a certaindegree of realism.''   _He said he was ``not in a position to prejudge what we woulddo'' if Yasser Arafat, leader of the Palestine LiberationOrganization, applied for a visa to visit the United States.Secretary of State George Shultz rejected such a request from Arafatlast November, but Arafat has since made statements more to U.S.officials' liking concerning terrorism and Israel.   _Answering a question prompted by documents at the heart of theIran-Contra affair, he said he believed all of the officials who bylaw are members of the National Security Council _ the president,the vice president and the secretaries of state and defense _ shouldbe informed of presidential decisions to undertake covert actionsoverseas.   _Baker said he believed that Bush, as a former United Nationsambassador, would be inclined to include in his budget request notonly full funding for the U.S. share of the world body's operatingcosts, but also installments on paying back dues accumulated duringthe Reagan administration.   Baker ``is very skillful, as he should be, and I'm impressed,''said Sen. Nancy Kassebaum, R-Kan., expressing a view apparentlyshared by many panel members.   ``I think he's going to make an excellent secretary of state andI'm ready to vote,'' added Sen. Terry Sanford, D-N.C.   On the subject of refugees, the State Department said last weekthat the quota for Soviet and other East European refugees would beraised by 7,000 this year and the quota for Vietnamese refugeeswould be lowered because many of the Vietnamese are former politicalprisoners unable to emigrate.   Baker said the plight of some Vietnamese was ``a major problem.''   Closer to home, Baker said he was unaware of reports cited bySen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., that the United States, through the CIA orsome other avenue, is covertly financing the campaign of theChristian Democratic Party in El Salvador's presidential electionsscheduled for March.   ``I'm not familiar with what you have suggested is takingplace,'' Baker told Helms. He said he generally does not approve ofcovert U.S. funding of political campaigns in other countries, butsaid that on occasions it could be appropriate to defeat ``partiesor personalities inimical to the United States.''   On still another subject, responding to a question from Sen. JohnKerry, D-Mass., Baker said, ``I think you will see a new approachtoward acid rain from this administration,'' although he did not saywhat that approach would be. The Reagan administration often wascriticized, particularly by Canada, for dragging its feet on takingaction to mitigate the problem.</TEXT></DOC>
