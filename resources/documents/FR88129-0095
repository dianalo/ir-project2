Specifically, the Division will modify the system notice by making minorchanges, both factual and editorial; by revising the routine use languagein several instances to provide clarity and to include specificity; bydeleting two routine uses; by adding a routine use for disclosure of certainrecords pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act request; by revising thecategories of records to show that the system contains national security,civil investigatory and criminal law enforcement information; and by indicatingthat a rule has been promulgated to exempt the system from certain PrivacyAct provisions. All changes have been italicized for public conveniencein the system notice reprinted below. The exemption of this system is morefully described in the Proposed Rules Section of today's <T4>Federal Register.</T4> Title 5 of the U.S. Code, Sections 552a(e) (4) and (11), require that thepublic be given 30 days in which to comment on new routine uses of informationin the system. However, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), whichhas oversight responsibility under the Act, requires 60 days in which toreview the proposed new routine uses and exemptions for the system. Therefore,the public, OMB, and the Congress are invited to submit written commentsby March 29, 1988, to J. Michael Clark, Assistant Director, Facilitiesand Administrative Services Staff, Justice Management Division, Departmentof Justice, Room 6402, 601 D Street NW., Washington, DC 20530.
