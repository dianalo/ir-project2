Iran's vows of vengeance against the United States had littleeffect Tuesday on the oil markets, and experts said they saw littlechance that heightened hostilities in the gulf would constrictshipping or inflate crude prices. The 13-nation OPEC cartel wasonce able to dictate prices through its ability to constrictsupplies.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, a sensitive barometer ofworld prices, the contract for August delivery of West TexasIntermediate crude oil rose 15 cents a barrel Tuesday to $15.09 inlight trading. Crude prices rose further this morning to $15.31.   But traders ascribed the rise to short-term speculative buying.Many emphasized that the market remained depressed because ofworldwide oversupply, and said the outlook for prices was down.   ``Demand is small and supply is great, and as we see it rightnow, no one's going to listen to what the Iranians say,'' saidThomas McKiernan, head of McKiernan andamp; Co., an energy-futurestrading concern in New York.   Others said traders were preoccupied with evidence that twomembers of OPEC, the United Arab Emirates and Iraq, were ignoringoutput restraints, selling into a market already glutted with oil.   ``The market's concerned with the possibility we may be driftinginto another price war situation, based on the fact that you nowhave two members of OPEC that are overtly flouting their quotas,''said Morris Greenberg, director of energy analysis at the WefaGroup, a forecasting firm in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.   ``For the other members it's difficult to justify sticking totheir quotas,'' Greenberg said. ``As a result, it can lead to asituation where you have a complete breakdown.''   The $15-a-barrel range where prices are now is $3 less thanOPEC's target and is the lowest level this year. Greenberg said hesaw the possibility of $14-a-barrel oil shortly and $12-a-barreloil if OPEC cannot discipline itself.</TEXT></DOC>
