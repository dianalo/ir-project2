Hutton andamp; Co. agreed to plead guilty to as many as three felony counts and to pay a fine for money laundering, some of it conducted for organized crime figures, according to Justice Department officials.    The company disclosed details of its pending agreement with the Justice Department in a quarterly report filed last week with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the officials said.    Federal authorities have been investigating allegations that Hutton, which was acquired last year by Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., failed to report $1.2 million in cash transactions of more than $10,000 each, as required by law, in its Providence, R.I., branch between 1982 and 1984.    Some of the deals were for organized crime figures, while others were for business people trying to hide income from the Internal Revenue Service, Justice Department officials said.    Under SEC rules, a felony conviction could result in the total suspension of the company's right to engage in the securities business.    Shearson Lehman Brothers officials couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
