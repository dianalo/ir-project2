The successto date is a result of the high efficiency of the process and its lowcapital and operating costs. Recently UOP developed and commercializeda Penex process modification, in which the entire recycle gas systemis eliminated, resulting in further economic savings to the refiner.The improvement in the economic efficiency of the process comes not onlyfrom the reduction in capital investment, but also from operating costsavings due to better heat integration. This paper presents pilot plantresults and data from the first commercial unit in which this new flowscheme has been implemented. The improvements in the process economicsare illustrated in case studies for a Penex unit with the new flow configuration.Enhanced heat integration particularly benefits the economics of an operationwith recycle of low octane products. Economic analyses of alternativerecycle options are included.</TEXT></DOC>
