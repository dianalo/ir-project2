Iran-Iraq peace talks have stalled and both sides are rearmingamid a widening proliferation of long-range missiles in the region.   This is eroding Israel's long-held technological superiority andheightening superpower concern of a new arms race, includingnuclear and chemical weapons, in the volatile region.   The pace of the Arab-Israeli peace process is unlikely to gathermomentum for some time, until Israel's right-wing prime minister,Yitzhak Shamir, relaxes his hardline position of refusing tonegotiate with Yasser Arafat's Palestine Liberation Organization.   Many observers believe this is unlikely unless there is intensepressure from Washington. Shamir, at odds with a faction of his ownLikud Party as well as his Labor coalition partners, is in noposition to start making concessions.   Egypt is expected to remain the crucial mediator between Israel,with whom it signed a peace treaty in 1979, the Palestinians andother Arab states in trying to reach a comprehensive Mideast peacesettlement.   The current focal point of the peace process is a 10-point planproduced by Egypt's President Hosni Mubarak, designed to break thedeadlock over Israel's blueprint for elections in the troubledoccupied West Bank and Gaza Strip, torn by a Palestinian uprisingfor the last two years.   The main stumbling block is the Israeli government's refusal tonegotiate with Palestinians they believe will speak for Arafat'sPLO.   Arafat, backed by the Arab League, insists there can be no peaceconference not attended by the PLO, which Arabs acknowledge as thePalestinians' sole representative.   Despite Israeli claims the uprising is foundering, it shows nosign of collapsing. The fear is that if there is no discernibleprogress in the peace process, it will intensify.   Analysts believe Arafat, after publicly renouncing terrorism andrecognizing Israel's right to exist, has gone as far down the roadto moderation as he can without alienating the PLO's hardliners.   A year-old dialogue with the United States has failed to resultin Washington jarring any concessions from the Israelis. Failure toproduce substantive results will leave Arafat exposed and his peaceinitiative discredited from within the PLO.   Hardliners like George Habash of the Popular Front for theLiberation of Palestine have made clear their patience is runningout.   The Arab-Israeli peace process, which has dragged on for morethan 20 years with only Egypt's peace treaty to show for it, has aprofound impact on the region's other conflicts.   This is most pronounced in Lebanon, the Middle East's proxybattleground, where the Arab League was finally jolted into takingforceful action to end 14 years of civil war.   But the peace settlement it brokered has stalled because theChristian leader, Gen. Michel Aoun, rejects it, citing its failureto provide cast-iron guarantees of a Syrian withdrawal.   The Syrians, their efforts to pacify their unruly neighborthwarted yet again by Lebanese Christians, are becoming frustratedand may yet move against Aoun.   Radical Syria, which needs Lebanon as a security buffer betweenitself and Israel, is likely to come under pressure from Moscow tomoderate its stand on the overall Middle East settlement as detenteimproves.   Moscow, increasingly crucial to the peace process after years ofbeing edged out by Washington, is already seeking to persuade Syriato abandon its drive for military parity with Israel.   The Kremlin, increasingly concerned with economic and socialupheaval at home, has made clear that Syria must end its rifts withIraq, Egypt and the PLO to achieve the long-elusive Arab unity thatis a prerequisite for an international peace conference.   Iran, Syria's ostensible ally, also is in transition followingthe death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and the election ofHashemi Rafsanjani, leader of the so-called pragmatists, aspresident last summer.   He seeks to open up Iran after a decade of isolation, attractWestern investment and technology to revitalize the moribundeconomy following the 1988 cease-fire in the 8-year war with Iraq.   He is opposed by revolutionary hardliners and much will dependon whether he can fend off the challenge and ease economichardships for Iran's 55 million population, growing at an alarming3.5 percent a year.   If he can, one key consequence could be the release of Westernhostages held by pro-Iranian militants in Lebanon and the removalof a major source in instability in the region.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday, Dec. 31</NOTE></DOC>
