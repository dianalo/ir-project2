Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT FIN </CO><IN> BNK TNM </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thrift regulators, frustrated by slow progress in selling insolvent thrifts, have decided to imitate the fast-food business.    In a program one regulator dubs &quot;McDeal,&quot; the Federal Home Loan Bank Board is about to try prepackaging and marketing insolvent thrifts a little more like hamburgers. &quot;It'll be cash and carry,&quot; said Bank Board Chairman Danny Wall.    The Federal Home Loan Banks have identified 21 thrifts -- all outside the troubled Southwest -- to be auctioned quickly, Mr. Wall said. The board's expedited procedures call for these thrifts to be delivered to buyers by mid-September, he said, little more than a month after bids are submitted.    The Bank Board cooked up the program to answer criticism of the slow pace with which it is resolving thrift insolvencies, Mr. Wall said. Transactions are taking as long as six months to close as lawyers haggle over many variables.    As a result, only about 40 sick institutions have been merged or closed so far in 1988, about one-fifth of the number that the board projects for the year.    In an unrelated matter involving its largest insolvent thrift, the Bank Board yesterday expanded its pledges to protect the rights of parties engaged in certain securities dealings with the American Savings andamp; Loan unit of Financial Corp. of America if the Bank Board takes the big thrift into receivership. The board is currently negotiating an assisted transfer of the thrift to the Robert M. Bass Group, Fort Worth, Texas.    In its expedited marketing program, the Bank Board is soliciting interest from about 700 potential buyers. Mr. Wall said it plans to send out proposals June 29 listing the minimum terms the Bank Board will accept for the thrifts. Bids will be due Aug. 5, and the transactions will be closed 35 days later, he said.    In general, officials said, the Bank Board will issue cash or a note to make up for the negative net worth of the institutions, and will seek cash equal to at least 3% of their assets.    Some industry officials already are disparaging the McDeals as financial institution junk food: quick, easy and not nourishing. They say the transactions entail greater risk because they won't include financial guarantees that the Bank Board usually issues to protect the acquirer from any loss on delinquent loans.    But Mr. Wall said the institutions, ranging in size from $16 million to $2.2 billion in assets, have been selected for fast sale because they don't have hidden problems in their loan portfolios. The Bank Board is confident, he said, &quot;that we know what we've got.&quot;    Mr. Wall estimated the cost of handling all 21 institutions at $200 million to $250 million, suggesting they aren't deeply insolvent. But he added: &quot;The longer we allow these institutions to continue operating in their present insolvent state, the more it will ultimately cost the FSLIC.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
