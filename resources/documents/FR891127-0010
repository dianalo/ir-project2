Talentino, Office ofDefects Investigation, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590(202-366-5212).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On May 26, 1987, Motor Voters, a consumer organization interested in motorvehicle safety, petitioned the agency to require manufacturers of passengervehicles to include information about NHTSA in the vehicle owners' manual.Specifically, the petitioner requested that the agency require informationadvising owners about NHTSA's safety defect authority and urging them tocontact the agency about potential safety defects in their vehicles. Tofacilitate contacting the agency, the petitioner requested that the agencyrequire manufacturers to include the toll-free telephone number of theAuto Safety Hotline and the agency's address. The petitioner suggestedthat the message explain that while the agency has authority to investigatedefects and order recall and remedy campaigns, it does not become directlyinvolved in the dealings of a particular consumer with a manufacturer ofa motor vehicle regarding a defect in that vehicle.<ITAG tagnum="84">Notice of Proposed Rulemaking</ITAG>In response to the petition, on November 10, 1988, NHTSA published a noticeof proposed rulemaking (NPRM) proposing to amend title 49 CFR part 575,<T3>Consumer Information Regulations</T3>. (53 FR 45527). The NPRM explainedthat the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act (``Vehicle SafetyAct,'' 15 U.S.C. 1381 <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires manufacturers of motor vehicles and motor vehicleequipment to recall and remedy vehicles and equipment that are determinedby the manufacturer or NHTSA to contain either a safety-related defector a failure to comply with a Federal motor vehicle safety standard issuedunder the Vehicle Safety Act. The NPRM further noted that the agency'smost important source of data used to identify defects which relate tomotor vehicle safety is the consumer complaints made by persons callingthe agency's toll-free Auto Safety Hotline. In 1987, the agency received332,659 calls on the Hotline, of which 75 percent concerned alleged defectsor recall information. In addition, over 15,092 of these Hotline callersfollowed up by completing and returning to NHTSA detailed Vehicle OwnerQuestionnaires which were mailed by the agency to callers reporting defectsand seeking recall information. The NPRM also noted that a longstandingagency goal is to enhance publication of the Auto Safety Hotline and soimprove the process of getting information from consumers about potentialsafety defects. The NPRM explained the agency's plans to publicize theHotline through public service announcements in the media, through consumerand corporate safety offices, in telephone books, and through programswith State transportation agencies.NHTSA's tentatively concluded that the inclusion of the requested informationin each owner's manual would be an important addition to NHTSA's publicinformation campaign to increase consumer awareness of the Hotline andthe agency's efforts to strengthen its defect investigation activities.The agency stated its tentative belief that including the Hotline numberin owner's manuals would put that number in the hands of millions of motorvehicle purchasers at virtually no additional cost. Moreover, the NPRMnoted that since owners typically refer to their manuals periodically throughoutthe ownership of their vehicles, especially when they are experiencingvehicle problems, the Hotline number printed in the manuals would be seenmany times. The agency stated that inclusion of the Hotline number in manualswould be particularly important for new car owners, since it would producea higher volume of calls about potential safety defects earlier in a vehicle'slife. The agency believed that this would be particularly important todetect defects in newly introduced models.The NPRM accordingly proposed to amend andSection; 575.6 of the ConsumerInformation Regulations to require motor vehicle manufacturers to includeinformation about NHTSA's recall and remedy authority and about the AutoSafety Hotline in the owner's manual. The agency proposed requiring thatall new motor vehicles, not just ``passenger vehicles,'' be subject tothe proposed amendment. The agency explained that facilitating owner reportingof potential safety defects would be important for all types of motor vehicles.The agency also made minor changes in the information requirements requestedin the petition.The proposed amendment required a manufacturer to state in each owner'smanual that consumers may contact NHTSA if they believe that their vehiclecontains a safety defect. The proposed amendment also required that themanuals include the toll-free Hotline telephone number and agency address.Finally, the proposed amendment required that manufacturers include inthe manuals a statement about the agency's authority to order a safetyrecall if it finds that a safety defect exists in a group of vehicles.<ITAG tagnum="84">Comments and the Agency's Response</ITAG>NHTSA received 24 comments in response to the NPRM. Commenters included15 automotive manufacturers and automotive affiliates; four academic, medical,and insurance groups; and five consumers and consumer organizations. Theagency considered all these comments in developing this final rule.General Comments American Honda, American Insurance Association (AIA), Cagiva Motorcycleof North America, Children's Mercy Hospital, the National Consumers League(NCL), the University of Maryland's Center for Business and Public Policy,US Public Interest Research Group (``US Pirg''), and several citizens favoredthe proposal. US Pirg stated that the proposal would be a cost-effectiveand efficient way to improve consumer awareness of the Hotline. NCL commentedthat this measure would further the agency's need to receive informationabout safety defects so that the agency can protect the consumer. On the other hand, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors (GM), General Tire, Mercedes,Michelin, the Motor Vehicle Manufacturers Association (MVMA), the NationalAutomobile Dealers Association (NADA), Navistar, Volkswagen and Volvo opposedthe proposal. NADA stated that there was no need for the rule and suggestedNHTSA reevaluate the proposal. MVMA similarly commented that there wasno safety need for this requirement. Ford, Michelin, MVMA, Chrysler, GeneralTire, GM, and Volkswagen elaborated that the proposal was unnecessary,might adversely affect customer manufacturer relations, delay correctiveaction, and overburden the agency's resources to respond to calls. Mercedesstated that the proposal would give consumers the false impression thatthey could receive immediate action related to their problems and thatresolution of the problem would be delayed. Volvo commented that the rulewould not be in the best interests of the vehicle owners, who would bebetter served by contacting the manufacturer rather than NHTSA. Upon considering these comments in light of current trends in consumerawareness, NHTSA concludes that the benefits of increasing the availabilityof information about consumer remedies support the inclusion of informationabout the agency in the owner's manuals. Calls to the Hotline decreasedfrom about 332,000 in 1987 to 252,000 in 1988, a reduction of about 24percent. In turn, receipt of Vehicle Owner's Questionnaires decreased fromabout 15,000 in 1987 to about 12,000 in 1988. The agency believes thatthis new information will increase consumer awareness about the Hotlineand the agency's defect investigation activities, especially for newlyintroduced models, and thus will improve the agency's information aboutpotential safety defects and noncompliances. The agency is accordinglyadopting the proposals. The increased dissemination of information aboutNHTSA will enable the agency to identify, investigate, and resolve potentialproblems more rapidly, because the agency will have a more extensive andmore timely data base for analyzing owners' experiences with a given problem.Chrysler, MVMA, and Volkswagen disagreed with the statement in the NPRMthat the Hotline was the agency's most important source of data used toidentify safety-related defects. Although the commenters are correct innoting that many recalls are initiated by manufacturers based on theirown tests and field evaluations, the statement referred to NHTSA's owninvestigations, which continue to influence a high percentage of the totalvehicles recalled and which rely heavily on consumer contacts through theHotline.Message's Language The NPRM proposed to require the following message in the owner's manual:<ITAG tagnum="21">If you believe that a vehicle or item of motor vehicle equipment (suchas tires, lamps, etc.) has a potential safety-related defect, you may notifythe National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). You may eithercall toll free at 800-424-9393 (or 366-0123 in Washington, D.C.) or writeAdministrator, NHTSA, 400 Seventh Street, S.W., Washington D.C. 20590.NHTSA investigates alleged safety-related defects and may order a recalland remedy campaign if it finds that a safety defect exists in a groupof vehicles and the manufacturer does not voluntarily conduct a recalland remedy campaign. However, NHTSA does not become directly involved inthe dealings between a particular consumer and a vehicle manufacturer regardinga defect in the consumer's vehicle.</ITAG>Mercedes and other manufacturers commented that this proposed languagewould hinder their relationship with their customers by delaying the correctionof vehicle problems and by providing the unrealistic expectation that NHTSAcan remedy the problem. According to these commenters, a consumer shouldcontact the manufacturer before contacting the agency because the manufactureris in a better position to actually remedy a safety related defect. In response to this comment, NHTSA iterates that requiring this messagewill help to publicize the Auto Safety Hotline and NHTSA's related activities.The agency believes that NHTSA might lose valuable information from ownersif the message did not initially focus on the agency's information collectionresponsibilities. For instance, in order for NHTSA to react quickly toreports of a defect trend, it is necessary for the agency to receive theinformation as soon as possible. The agency believes that this invitationfor early consumer communication to NHTSA will also encourage manufacturersto act quickly to address consumer concerns. The agency further notes thateven if NHTSA is contacted first, a manufacturer still will become awareof a problem because the agency will notify them about these complaints.NHTSA nevertheless agrees with the commenters that the public should beinstructed to also contact the manufacturer. Therefore, the agency hasrevised the message to state that a consumer should also contact the manufactureror its designate (e.g., its authorized dealer) to resolve safety-relatedor other problems with the vehicle. In addition, the final rule explainsNHTSA's authority and limitations more clearly. NHTSA believes that thesemodifications will increase the effectiveness of the message. The agency emphasizes that NHTSA's message is mandatory, and thus a manufacturercannot modify or otherwise vary it. Nevertheless, the agency notes thata manufacturer may place additional language elsewhere in the owner's manualencouraging a vehicle owner to contact them, provided that this additionalinformation is not included in the message required by NHTSA and does nototherwise dilute the content of the required message. GM suggested that the message be written in a ``plain English'' style.After reexamining the proposal's wording, NHTSA agrees with GM that toincrease the final rule's effectiveness, the message should be writtenin an easily understood style. Accordingly, the final rule adopts moresimplified wording whenever such wording does not misstate the legalitiesor realities of NHTSA's defect investigation and recall and remedy program.Volkswagen commented that listing examples of equipment would result inconsumers overreporting those items of equipment. In response to this comment,NHTSA has decided to eliminate these examples in the required message.The agency agrees with Volkswagen that including examples might bias thereporting and thus provide an inaccurate record of overall complaints aboutequipment. Accordingly, the final rule deletes reference to ``tires, lamps,etc.''Several commenters noted that the proposed message should include moreinformation than the NPRM proposed. The American Insurance Association(AIA) and Gillis and Associates stated that the final rule should containinformation about other NHTSA activities such as drunk driving and odometerfraud. The NCL commented that NHTSA should expand the message to informconsumers that they should contact other consumer organizations such asthe Better Business Bureau. NADA suggested that the required message shouldstate that consumers should initially refer to the warranty booklet's sectionconcerning dispute resolution and then contact the manufacturer.After reviewing these comments, NHTSA has decided to include a generalstatement that a consumer can ``get other information about motor vehiclesafety from the Hotline.'' Nevertheless, the agency believes that the finalrule should not include detailed information about NHTSA's other consumerprotection matters. The agency notes that the principal purpose of thisrule is to disseminate information about the Auto Safety Hotline and NHTSA'sdefect investigation authority which will lead to the increased reportingof potential safety defects and noncompliances with safety standards. Theagency further notes that the rule is not intended as an all-encompassingsource of consumer information. NHTSA believes that if the message wererequired to address all the agency's activities and consumer protection,then the most important information about this rulemaking (the Hotlineand NHTSA's defect investigation authority) would be obscured. The agency notes that upon contacting the Auto Safety Hotline, the callerwill receive information about NHTSA's other activities. As for consumerprotection information (e.g., warranty information), NHTSA notes that thistype of activity is beyond the agency's statutory mandate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicability of Requirement</ITAG>Motor Voter's petition requested that NHTSA require ``passenger vehiclemanufacturers'' to include information about the Hotline and the agency'sdefect investigation authority. The NPRM expanded the applicability ofthis requirement to ``all new motor vehicles,'' reasoning that ``facilitatingowner reporting of potential safety defects is important for all typesof motor vehicles.'' US Pirg agreed with NHTSA's decision to expand the requirement's applicabilityto all motor vehicles. The Truck Trailer Manufacturers Association (TTMA)commented that the rule would create problems for small truck trailer manufacturers,some of which currently do not provide an owner's manual. After reviewing these comments, NHTSA concludes that the final rule shouldbe applicable to all motor vehicles, because any vehicle type may experiencea safety-related defect. However, to accommodate a manufacturer that doesnot provide an ``owner's manual,'' as defined in andSection; 572.2(c) ofthe final rule, the rule provides that the manufacturer may provide theinformation in a separate one-page document to be included with the salesdocuments. In other words, a manufacturer must include the required informationin the owner's manual if it provides one, or in a separate document ifit provides no manual. <ITAG tagnum="84">Placement of Information</ITAG>The NADA suggested that a manufacturer be given the option of includingthe required information in the warranty booklet rather than in the owner'smanual, claiming that consumers would more likely look in the warrantybooklet for assistance with defect matters. GM stated that the manufacturerwas in the best position to determine placement of the required information,suggesting that this information be placed in its ``Warranty and OwnerAssistance Information'' booklet. GM stated that a manufacturer shouldnot be required to place this information in the owner's manual. After reviewing these comments, NHTSA has determined that the manufacturermust include this information in the owner's manual. The agency believesthat requiring the information to be placed in the owner's manual willpromote uniformity among manufacturers. In addition, NHTSA notes that placingthe information in the warranty book would be less effective because thewarranty lasts for a finite time (often much less than the life of thevehicle), after which a vehicle owner would have little reason to retainthe book. In contrast, many manufacturers state in the owner's manual thatthis document should stay with the vehicle for its life, even if it sold.Thus, it is more likely that a vehicle's owner or owners will retain theowner's manual for a longer time period than the warranty booklet. Theagency notes that a manufacturer may place this information in any additionaldocument provided that it includes this information in the owner's manual.The agency is aware that manufacturers refer to such documents by manyterms, including ``Owner's Guide,'' ``Owner's Handbook,'' or ``OperatingInstructions.'' Accordingly, the final rule expressly defines an ``owner'smanual'' in andSection; 575.2(c) as ``the document which contains the manufacturer'scomprehensive vehicle operating [and maintenance] instructions, and whichis intended to remain with the vehicle for the life of the vehicle.'' Several organizations commented about the placement of this informationwithin the owner's manual. Volvo Truck stated that a manufacturer shouldhave discretion about where it places the information. Volkswagen statedthat this information be placed near the information on customer assistance.Gillis and the Center for Business and Policy did not suggest a specificlocation in the manual but noted that the agency should require that amanufacturer refer to it in the table of contents. US Pirg suggested thatthe agency require the information to be placed in a prominent locationsuch as the front or back cover to prevent a manufacturer from ``bury(ing)''it. NCL stated that the agency should specify the location to reduce reportingdiscrepancies. It suggested in order of preference that the informationbe placed opposite the first page of the table of contents, on the insidefront cover, in the text preceding the maintenance schedule, or on theinside back cover. After reviewing these comments, NHTSA agrees with Volvo Truck that a manufacturershould be given discretion about where it places the information. The agencybelieves that requiring the table of contents to include reference to theHotline will adequately ensure that vehicle owner's will see this information.Accordingly, andSection; 575.6(a)(2)(B) of the final rule also requires thatthe table of contents in the owner's manual specify the location of theinformation about NHTSA. In particular, the heading must be entitled ``ReportingSafety Defects'' and include the corresponding page number to effectivelyalert consumers and to provide uniformity as to the heading. Two commenters offered their views on the type size. Volvo GM Heavy Truckrequested that the type size be left to the manufacturer's discretion.NCL commented that the rule should specify a minimum point size for thetype. It further stated that NHTSA should specify a minimum amount of spacenot less than one-half page for this information. NHTSA has concluded that to be easily readable the required message mustbe written in letters and numbers not smaller than 10 point type, and hasincorporated that requirement in the final rule. The agency notes thatthe point type size is consistent with the labeling requirements in S5.5.2of Standard No. 213. The agency concludes that it is superfluous to specifya minimum page length because the final rule specifies the type size andthe message itself.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effective Date </ITAG>The NPRM proposed that the rule would become effective ``180 days afterthe publication of the final rule.'' Several manufacturers requested thatthe effective date coincide with the start of the model year to avoid unnecessarycosts that would result in reprinting manuals during the middle of a modelyear. American Honda suggested that the effective date coincide with thechange in model year. Volvo GM Heavy Truck requested that the effectivedate be changed to ``January 1, or at the option of the manufacturer, thetime of model year change-over.'' Cagiva, which changes its motorcyclemodels every two to four years, requested an effective date that would``allow us adequate lead time to incorporate the regulatory language''at the start of its model run. Chrysler recommended an effective date ofthe ``first day of September occurring 180 days after publication of thefinal rule.'' Navistar requested an effective date of 270 days after thefinal rule's publication. US Pirg noted that the agency should ``act promptly.''After reviewing these comments, NHTSA determines that the effective datewill be September 1, 1990, which typically is the beginning of a modelyear for most vehicles. The agency believes that this effective date willallow the timely inclusion of this information at little or no cost tothe manufacturers.Cagiva requested that the final rule allow it to exhaust its supply ofalready printed manuals, explaining that its model runs may extend up tofour years. A manufacturer whose models run for more than one year maycomply with the final rule by placing an add-on-sticker on its existingmanuals, until this supply is exhausted. The agency believes that thiswill ensure that consumers receive the information while minimizing thecosts related to this rule for manufacturers like Cagiva.<ITAG tagnum="84">Costs</ITAG>The NPRM tentatively concluded that the proposal would result in minimalcosts related to printing an additional half-page of material.Several commenters addressed the final rule's cost impacts. NADA statedthat the costs of this measure would not be a significant burden on manufacturersprovided that it was phased in for new manuals. US Pirg commented thatthis rule would be a cost-effective way to improve consumer awareness ofthe Hotline. On the other hand, the MVMA stated that NHTSA underestimatedthe final rule's indirect costs to both NHTSA and manufacturers, especiallycosts resulting from the delay in handling consumer complaints. Volkswagenrecommended that the agency further study the proposal, stating that theagency underestimated the number of consumer complaints, which would resultin a large volume of additional contacts.After reexamining the proposal in light of these comments, NHTSA concludesthat the final rule will impose only minimal costs on motor vehicle manufacturersand the agency. The agency anticipates that a manufacturer will have todevote only on-half page in the manual at a cost of a few cents per manualfor printing. The agency disagrees with MVMA and Volkswagen that therewill be significant costs beyond the direct printing costs. The agencybelieves that MVMA's concern that consumer complaints will be handled inefficientlyis adequately addressed by language in the final rule emphasizing thata consumer should contact the vehicle manufacturer first.NHTSA does not anticipate that additional calls to the Hotline will resultin unreasonable costs to the agency. First, the Hotline is well equippedto handle additional calls without increased costs. Second, it is in NHTSA's(and the general public's) interests to receive additional calls potentiallyrelated to safety defects. The agency believes that these additional callswill lead to defect investigations and the earlier remedy of safety problems.<ITAG tagnum="84">Miscellaneous</ITAG>NHTSA has examined the impacts of this regulation and determined that thisfinal rule does not qualify as a major regulation within the meaning ofExecutive Order 12291 or as a significant regulation under Department ofTransportation regulatory policies or procedures. The agency also has determinedthat the economic and other impacts of this rule are minimal so that aregulatory evaluation is not required. The information required to be placedin the vehicle's owner's manual will result in only minimal costs for vehiclemanufacturers and will not likely result in any cost increase for consumers.The agency also considered the impacts of this rule under the provisionsof the Regulatory Flexibility Act. I hereby certify that the regulationwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. As discussed above, the cost of including the informationin the owner's manual will be only a few cents per manual. Accordingly,there will be little economic effect on any small organizations or governmentalunits which purchase motor vehicles. Few if any vehicle manufacturers qualifyas small entities under the Act.Further, this rulemaking action has been analyzed in accordance with theprinciples and criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it hasbeen determined that it has no Federalism implication that warrants preparationof a Federalism report.NHTSA has analyzed this rule for purposes of the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act. The agency has determined that implementation of this actionwill not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 49 CFR Part 575</ITAG>Consumer protection, Labeling, Motor vehicle safety, Motor vehicles, Rubberand rubber products, Tires.In consideration of the foregoing, 49 CFR part 575 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 575_CONSUMER INFORMATION REGULATIONS</ITAG>1.
