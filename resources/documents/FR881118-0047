This EIS also will integrate the requirements ofboth NEPA and the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, andLiability Act (CERCLA) as described below. Throughout the operational history of the Y-12 Plant, located on the OakRidge Reservation (ORR), production of radioactive and/or chemically hazardouswastewaters has occurred as a result of normal facility operations. Overthe years, various treated and untreated portions of these wastewatershave been discharged to EFPC, which has its headwaters at the Y-12 Plant.These discharges have led to contamination of EFPC and its associated floodplain.DOE is investigating the potential need for remedial action for the EFPCand the associated floodplain to mitigate the environmental impact fromexisting and potential surface and ground water contamination as well ascontamination in the sediments. A floodplain/wetlands assessment will beprepared under 10 CFR 1022, the DOE regulations that implement ExecutiveOrders 11988 (Floodplain Management) and 11990 (Protection of Wetlands),which will describe impacts, altenatives for remediation, and mitigatingmeasures to be employed in the action. In addition, DOE will consider potentialenvironmental impacts, as well as engineering and cost considerations,in its decisions by preparing an EIS on potential remedial actions forEFPC and its floodplain. This environmental review and analysis process will integrate the requirementsof both NEPA and CERCLA, as amended by the Superfund Amendments and ReauthorizationAct (SARA), to satisfy the policy requirements of DOE Notice 5400.4. AllEIS requirements under NEPA will be incorporated into the Remedial Investigation/FeasibilityStudy (RI/FS) documents of CERCLA. The purpose of this Notice of Intentis to present pertinent background information on the proposed scope andcontent of the RI/FS-EIS and to solicit comments and suggestions for considerationin their preparation. DOE invites interested agencies, organizations, andmembers of the general public to submit comments or suggestions to assistDOE in identifying significant environmental issues and determining theappropriate scope of the EIS. Comments may be submitted to DOE by mail or presented at a scoping meetingto be held at the Main Auditorium of the American Museum of Science andEnergy, 300 South Tulane Avenue, Oak Ridge, Tennessee, on Tuesday, December6, 1988, starting at 7:30 p.m. Upon completion of the draft EIS, its availability will be announced inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> and local news media.

Initiailly, as part of the Manhattan Project,its functions was to separate U-235 from other isotopes of uranium. AfterWorld War II, the Y-12 Plant became engaged in other activities includingresearch in nuclear products applications, energy research, and metallurgy.One component of these efforts was the use of mercury at Y-12 as part ofthe production of enriched lithium for use in thermonuclear weapons. Millionsof pounds of mercury were used in this effort. Mercury is the most significant contaminant found in the EFPC and the associatedfloodplain. An estimated 239,000 pounds of mercury were released to EFPCduring the period 1950-1982. In addition, other heavy metals, radionuclides,and some organic compunds also have been found in EFPC. Releases of mercuryto the environment have occurred both during production and since cessationof production operations. During Y-12 operations, spills and maintenanceoperations resulted in losses to land, air, and surface water.A number of wasterwater collection and storage facilities have been constructedor are planned that will mitigate releases to EFPC. These collection facilitiesare an integral part of the Y-12 Plan Water Pollution Control Program.Wastewaters having volumes too large to justify a storage system at thepoint of generation (e.g., coal pile runoff and plating rinse waters fromthe main plating shop) are directly piped to their corresponding treatmentfacilities. Some Process wastewaters are permitted to discharge with minimaltreatment; these waste streams will continue to discharge to EFPC as longas toxicity testing deems the effluent nontoxic.In addition to the strategy for eliminating wastewater discharged to EFPC,strategies exist for minimizing pollutants reaching waters of the State.For example, the use of best management practices (BMPs) will minimizethe discharge of pollutants to receiving waters. BMPs include, but arenot limited to, the use of better process controls, preventive maintenanceprograms, inspection programs, and adequate planning to mitigate accidentalspills. In addition, various spill prevention programs have been initiatedto reduce the potential for accidental spills in those areas where thereis a risk.Even though the process buildings are no longer used to conduct mercuryseparation activities, the process equipment, contaminated switch gear,building materials, floors, and building and storm drains remain a sourceof potential contamination, and a potential for release of mercury to theenvironment. Steps have been taken to mitigate these potential releases.These potential sources and pathways to the environment will be a separateremedial action for the Y-12 Plant and will be assessed in separate documentation.After release by DOE in May 1983 of information which documented mercurycontamination offsite, DOE initiated sampling in EFPC in the Oak RidgeCommunity. DOE also requested the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to participatein studies to evaluate soil and sediment contamination in the EFPC environs.Analysis of 394 soil and sediment samples from 130 locations in the channeland floodplain of EFPC indicate approximately 126 million ft3 (760,000tons) of mercury contaminated sediment and soil with mercury concentrationsexceeding five parts per million (ppm). This sediment and soil containsan estimated 170,000 pounds of mercury. Approximately 80 percent of thetotal mercury is contained in 25 percent of the contaminated sediment andsoil (i.e., in sediment and soil with a concentration exceeding 100 ppm).Other contaminants in the floodplain include: Arsenic, barium, beryllium,cadmium, chromium, copper, lead, nickel, lithium, selenium, silver, thorium,uramium zinc, and PCBs. Organic constituents may also be present.The community and floodplain studies are originally coordinated by theOak Ridge Task Force (ORTF) consisting of representatives from the DOE,the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the U.S. Army Corps ofEngineers, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the Tennessee Departmentof Health and Environment (TDHE), the City of Oak Ridge, and the TVA.Remedial actions currently are being conducted on the ORR according toResource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) Sections 3004 (u) and 3004(v) permit requirements. When the ORR is placed on the National PrioritiesList, some cleanup activities will be performed under CERCLA, as amended,not RCRA. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is developing a strategyto integrate remedial actions under RCRA and CERCLA to minimize duplicationof effort and to ensure that corrective actions are consistent with theNational Contingency Plan.<ITAG tagnum="85">Preliminary Definition of Alternatives To Be Addressed in the RI/FS-EIS</ITAG>DOE intends to conduct a comprehensive environmental process to meet therequirements of CERCLA and NEPA for implementing response actions in theEFPC area. the environmental review and analysis process has two majorparts, a Remedial Investigation (RI) and a Feasibility Study (FS).The purpose of the RI is to characterize the site and the nature and extentof contamination. The FS then is designed to assess a range of remedialaction alternatives to address contamination at the site. The results ofeach are presented in a report. During the FS phase, bench or pilot testsof potential waste treatment technologies will be conducted as appropriate.Also, a baseline risk assessment will be conducted to identify the primaryhealth and environmental threats at this site.In addition to elimination or stabilization of mercury in the process areasand building drains, DOE already has begun evaluation of several remedialaction alternatives for EFPC and its floodplain. During the FS screeningof waste treatment technologies, several remedial alternatives will beidentified and screened, general performance criteria for each alternativewill be developed, and a detailed evaluation and comparison of reasonable(i.e., screened) alternatives will be performed. A specific preferred alternativewill not be identified until the FS is complete. However, the RI/FS-EISwill at a minimum consider the proposed alternatives listed below.<T3>Alternative 1:</T3> Passive Remediation. This alternative depend onthe natural dynamics of the ecosystem to correct any adverse conditionsin the EFPC stream bed and associated floodplain and is essentially the``no action'' alternative.<T3>Alternative 2:</T3> Dredge and Dispose of all Loose Sediment in theCreek by Mechanical or Suction Dredging. This alternative would use mechanicalor suction dredging to remove the loose sediments in EFPC in conjunctionwith proper disposal of the dredged sediments. These dredged sedimentswould be dewatered prior to disposal, in accordance with applicable requirements,and the liquid effluent would be collected and, if required, treated ata Y-12 Plant wastewater treatment facility.<T3>Alternative 3:</T3> Remove, Dispose, and Replace Floodplain Soils toVarious Depths. This alternative would remove and replace floodplain soils.The removed contaminated soil would be properly disposed of in an approvedfacility. The replacement soils would be tested to confirm they are notcontaminated prior to placement at the remediation site.<T3>Alternative 4:</T3> Cover Floodway Fringe Soils with Various Media.In this alternative, the floodway fringe soils would be covered to provideprotection against runoff erosion of the surface soils and against directhuman contact where necessary. Riprap would be used to cover the floodwayfringe soils to a depth of 1 foot. For vegetation support, additional generalfill would be put in place with a layer of top soil cover. This alternativewould require removel of all trees and shrubs befor putting the materialin place.<T3>Alternative 5:</T3> Permanently Reroute the Creek within the Floodplainand Remediate Abandoned Area with One of the Other Alternatives. This alternativewould permanently reroute the EFPC within the confines of the existingfloodplain. One of the other identified alternative would be implementedto remediate the abandoned area. Material excavated from the constructionof the new creek would be properly disposed of in an approved facility.<T3>Alternative 6:</T3> Permanently Reroute the Creek Outside of the Floodplainand Remediate the Abandoned Area with One of the Other Alternatives. Thisalternative considers permanent rerouting of the creek outside the existingfloodplain, in conjunction with one of the other alternatives to remediatethe abandoned area. Uncontaminated materials excavated from the constructionof the new creek would be distributed over the floodway fringe.<T3>Alternative 7:</T3> Stabilize Soil in Areas Where Entering Storm DrainsTraverse the Floodplain. This alternative proposes to stabilize storm drainstraversing the floodplain to prevent bank erosion. The use of riprap maybe an effective method for stabilizing the creek bank.<T3>Alternative 8:</T3> Stabilize Existing Stream Channel Banks. This alternativeproposes the stabilization of the existing creek by preventing the erosionof the banks due to in-channel flow and overflow from stream blockage.An effective method for bank stabilization is riprap protection. However,in general, fill would not be used in the floodway unless an equivalentvolume of material is removed. This alternative would require the removalof all trees and shrubs within 25 feet of the creek bank.<T3>Alternative 9:</T3> Dredge and Dispose of all Sediments in Creek andRemove, Dispose, and Replace Floodplain Soils to Various Depths. This alternativecombines alternatives 2 and 3 and involves mechanical dredging of the creeksediments and excavation of the floodplain soil.<T3>Alternative 10:</T3> Stabilize Existing Stream Channel Banks, Dredgeand Dispose of all Loose Sediments in Creek, and Stabilize Soil in AreasWhere Entering Storm Drains Traverse the Floodplain. This alternative combines2, 7, and 8. The description of these alternatives may be found in theappropriate sections.<ITAG tagnum="84">Preliminary List of Potential Issues</ITAG>There are a number of potential issues associated with the previously mentionedremedial action alternatives. Some of these issues deal with environmentaland public health impacts, whereas others are factors which may influenceor be influenced by implementation of one or more of the alternatives.The following is a description of major issues which may require analysisin the RI/FS-EIS. This list is not intended to be all inclusive or to precludeadditional issues from consideration.1. Potential Environmental ImpactsThe potential impacts of the described alternatives can be grouped intothree major categories as follows: Impacts to human health, ecologicalimpacts, and socioeconomic impacts. Also of concern are engineering andtechnical issues and potential institutional issues. The actual impactshave yet to be determined. Areas of interest within each of these identifiedtopics include:<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Potential Impacts on Human Health</ITAG>andbullet; Associated with cleanup, transport, treatment, and/or disposalof contaminated material:andbullet; Associated with accidental worker exposure;andbullet; Associated with a resuspension of contaminated sediments and soilsthrough remedial activities that may increase the potential exposure tothe general public through the air, water, and food-chain pathways;andbullet; Associated with leaving the contaminated soil and sediment inplace; andandbullet; Associated with potential contamination of the aquifers underlyingand recharged by the EFPC floodplain.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Potential Ecological Impacts</ITAG>andbullet; Associated with effects of contaminants on aquatic and terrestrialflora and fauna;andbullet; Associated with changes in flow of EFPC due to remedial activities;andandbullet; Associated with the destruction of the floodplain ecosystem bythe removal of all vegetation in connection with some of the remedial actionsoptions.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Potential Socioeconomic Impacts</ITAG>andbullet; Associated with marketability of properties potentially contaminated,especially located on the EFPC floodplain; andandbullet; Associatred with near- and short-term costs and benefits of remediationalternatives.2. Potential Engineering and Technical IssuesSeveral technical and engineering issues are associated with each of thepotential alternatives. One involves the logistics problems associatedwith using the required heavy equipment in the saturated areas of the floodplain.This problem consists of two parts: first, construction will slow downdue to difficulty with groundwater, slowing down the effort and potentiallycreating a greater environmental problem than originally present. The secondpart of this problem is associated with the operation of equipment on thefloodplain that may cause the contaminated sediments to be resuspendedand buried contamination to resurface. Appropriate control measures willbe considered to mitigate the potential effects of such activities.3. Potential Institutional IssuesThe investigation of remedial action alternatives will involve decisionsby DOE, the TDHE, and the EPA on several public policy and regulatory issues.In addition, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers must be consulted for possiblepermit requirements in order to work and possibly modify the creek channeland/or floodplain during remediation.One issue is the definition of the level of cleanup (or how clean is clean?)for the creek sediments and floodplain soils. In addition, the means forproper disposal of the removed sediments (if sediment removal is the remediationof choice) must be addressed prior to initiation of the effort.<ITAG tagnum="84">Scoping</ITAG>The scoping process will involve all interested agencies (Federal, State,and local), groups, and members of the general public. Oral and writtencomments are invited at the public scoping meeting on both the preliminarylist of alternatives and the issues to be considered in the RI/FS-EIS.This will be an informal meeting with a presiding officer and establishedprocedures governing the conduct of the meeting. The meeting will not beconducted as an evidentiary hearing, and those who choose to make statementswill not be cross-examined by other speakers or the presiding officer.To ensure that everyone who wishes to speak has a chance to do so, 5 minuteswill be allotted to each speaker. Depending on the number of persons requestingto be heard, DOE may allow longer times for representatives of organizations.Persons wishing to speak on behalf of an organization should identify theorganization in their request. Persons who have not submitted a requestto speak in advance may register to speak at the scoping meeting and willbe called upon to present their comments as time permits. Both oral andwritten comments will be given equal consideration.A transcript of the public scoping meeting will be taken and retained byDOE and made available for inspection at the Freedom of Information ReadingRoom, Forrestal Building, 1000 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC20585, during business hours, Monday through Friday. Additional copiesof the public scoping meeting transcript and other NEPA documents and majorreferences used in the preparation of the RI/FS-EIS also will be availableduring normal business hours at the following locations:<ITAG tagnum="15">The Oak Ridge Federal Building Reading Room, 200 Administration Road,Oak Ridge, Tennessee 37830.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">The Oak Ridge Public Library, Civic Center, Oak Ridge Turnpike, OakRidge, Tennessee 37830.</ITAG>A notice of locations where these documents will be available will be publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> along with the announcement of availability ofthe draft RI/FS-EIS.
