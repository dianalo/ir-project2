Garcia (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> MTOR GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK TNM REL CON FIN </IN><DATELINE> PHILADELPHIA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Meritor Financial Group Inc. won a concession from federal regulators and adopted an ambitious plan to stem losses and shore up its capital base in the next few months.    The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. dropped its request that the thrift carry certain mortgage-backed securities in its portfolio at market value rather than at book value. If regulators had pressed their case, Meritor would have lost a big chunk of its equity capital.    Separately, the thrift has put about $2 billion of its assets up for sale, including most of its mortgage, real-estate development and consumer-credit businesses. The plan was initiated by Roger Hillas, who became chairman and chief executive officer in early July. It also calls for a new and tougher examination of all of the thrift's current business operations.    Mr. Hillas, formerly chairman of Pittsburgh-based PNC Financial Corp., said in an interview yesterday that he would like to see Meritor shrink in assets to the range of $13 billion to $14 billion by year end. Meritor, currently the sixth largest thrift in the country, had $17.5 billion in assets as of June 30.    &quot;Size is a very secondary consideration,&quot; said Mr. Hillas. &quot;Returning to profitability is more important. We're looking at every line of business that doesn't make money (now) or doesn't have the prospect of making money&quot; in the near future.    Mr. Hillas has already set some of the plan in motion. But a good part of its success depends on a factor he can't control: the course of interest rates in the months ahead.    The thrift is trying to shed mostly financial assets such as mortgage-backed securities, real estate holdings, and credit companies, all of which will become far less attractive if rates climb.    Mr. Hillas said the current plan is to &quot;keep downsizing the company.&quot; Shrinking the asset base would help Meritor more easily meet the accord it recently reached with FDIC and the Pennsylvania Department of Banking. The thrift has agreed to boost its ratio of regulatory capital to assets to 6.5% by Dec. 31. If it can't meet that goal, Meritor has promised regulators that it would add about $200 million to capital by next March 31.    As of June 30, the ratio was 6.37%, representing $1.16 billion in capital. But the amount included $252 million of subordinated notes held by the FDIC that expire in early 1989. If Meritor can reduce its asset base by $3.5 billion to $4.5 billion by year end, as Mr. Hillas envisions, the company's regulatory capital on hand, excluding these notes, would be sufficient to meet the higher capital ratio requirement.    If shrinking doesn't do the trick, Mr. Hillas said the thrift is looking at all possible sources of funds. For example, the thrift has a credit facility with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board, which it joined in the second quarter, to borrow as much as $400 million. The rates on these funds would be below 10%, far more attractive than the notes, some of which carry rates as high as 17%.    For the moment, Meritor's savings bank units in Florida and the Washington, D.C., area aren't for sale. Mr. Hillas said he wants to straighten out some problems at these units before selling them. Separately, the thrift agreed last week to sell a $350 million block of student loans to a Pennsylvania state agency.    A big source of losses for Meritor was the default in 1985 of Equity Programs Investment Corp., or EPIC. Meritor was the biggest holder of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities issued by EPIC. Now Meritor has title to less than $100 million of EPIC-related properties, which it's working to sell. Mr. Hillas said 923 of these 2,600 properties, or about 35% of them, are under contract to be sold.    Mr. Hillas said he's even willing to spend $80 million to $100 million to get rid of some ill-fated, interest-rate swap agreements that Meritor took on in late 1984 as a hedge against higher rates. With rates moving generally downward since then, these rate swaps have been costing the thrift some $50 million a year.    The in-house review of Meritor's operations is deep and far-reaching. Executives are examining a long list of business questions, from whether Meritor should manage and sell its own mutual funds to whether it should carry a building-maintenance staff on its payroll or hire an outside service.    &quot;When you're losing large amounts of money, you have to take a look at everything you're doing,&quot; said Mr. Hillas. </TEXT></DOC>
