WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Republican presidential candidates George Bush andJack Kemp clashed bitterly over nuclear defense strategy Fridaynight, as Bush asserted the New York congressman won't understandwar until ``you've seen your fellow man drop dead.''   At the outset of the debate, reduced to a one-on-one event whenSen. Bob Dole and Pat Robertson canceled a day earlier, both Bushand Kemp said they regretted the boycott and said it would hurttheir opponents.   ``I think they made a big mistake,'' Bush said. ``I'mdisappointed they're not here.''   Kemp, who has finished far behind Bush and Dole in the Iowacaucuses and New Hampshire primaries, drew laughter from theaudience when he said, ``I'm glad to see the race coming down to atwo-man race.''   A former professional football quarterback, he referred tocomments by Dole and Robertson that they feared the audience wouldbe weighted heavily in favor of Bush, who claims Texas as one ofhis homes.   ``I have played a lot of stadiums (where) I didn't particularlyappreciate the response,'' Kemp said. ``But if you're competitiveyou play where the action is.''   As the two debated, Robertson was holding a rally withsupporters at the same posh Dallas hotel where Bush and hisentourage were staying. Dole returned to Washington from a campaigntrip.   Bush, his presidential candidacy revived last week with avictory in New Hampshire, portrayed himself as loyal to PresidentReagan on numerous questions. But in their close, it was Kemp whosought to snatch the mantle of Ronald Reagan.   ``I believe in the Reagan revolution and I want to carry it intothe 1990s,'' he said.   He made a similar statement during the testy exchange on nucleardefenses, prompting Bush to snap back, ``Then why don't you supportthe INF (intermediate nuclear force) treaty?''   Kemp came to the debate seeming to relish the opportunity toconfront Bush without his other rivals on national television.   He took the offensive when a question was raised about creationof a ``limited missile defense'' instead of the wide-rangingStrategic Defense Initiative now being pursued as a nuclear defense.   ``I'd build one if the SDI research ended up suggesting we couldhave a sound, perfected defense,'' the vice president replied.   There exchange grew more intense as Bush said the Joint Chiefsof Staff would oppose a more limited defense system and that theadministration was trying to produce ``an impenetrable nuclearshield.''   Kemp shot back that the Soviet Union has ``already broken outof'' the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) treaty and said, ``I stronglydiffer with the vice president on this issue. ... If electedpresident, I would research, test and develop a nuclear missiledefense.''   Bush said it would be wrong to support ``premature development''of a defense shield.   ``I want to reach out for peace, and I'm sorry, but I think itis good to be doing that,'' Bush said.   Bush's reference to his World War II record came after Kempasserted that the country must ``stand up for something'' beyondpeace alone.   The vice president shot back: ``I was in combat. I don't thinkyou know what it is until you've seen your fellow man drop dead.''   Kemp snapped: ``I don't need a lecture.''   The absent Dole and Robertson came in for criticism too. Kemp,at the invitation of a questioner, said Dole had supported ``fivemajor tax increases.''   Kemp displayed mock outrage when asked about the discussionsDole and Robertson held before both pulled out of the debate.   ``I would be shocked if there was an alliance between Bob Doleand Pat Robertson,'' Kemp said.   His comments had a touch of irony because he for a time had analliance with Robertson to try to stop Bush in Michigan'scomplicated delegate-selection system.   Dole pulled out of the debate saying he feared it would become apep rally for Bush.   Robertson, the former television preacher who finished secondahead of Bush in Iowa but trailed badly in New Hampshire, followedDole in pulling out. His aides said they thought the event wasstacked in Bush's favor.   The result was a rare and unexpected opportunity for Kemp toshare the stage with only Bush in an event televised nationally onselected public broadcasting stations. The debate was held on theSouthern Methodist University campus.   Kemp has sought to establish himself as the conservativealternative to Bush and Dole. But he finished a distant fourth inIowa's caucuses and third, with 13 percent of the vote, in NewHampshire.   Across town, Robertson attended a rally with 1,200 supportersand told them, ``There was a debate tonight and we understood theyweren't going to give our supporters but 60 tickets to sit up inthe balcony, and I wasn't about to go because you needed to berepresented and I'd rather be with you here.''   Earlier in the day Dole denied the assertion of the debate'ssponsors that he had tried to persuade Robertson to join him indropping out of the debate. He acknowledged discussing it withRobertson while in New Hampshire, however.   ``I just gave him the facts,'' said Dole.   Burl Osborne, editor of the Dallas Morning News, one of thedebate's sponsors, rejected as untrue Dole's complaint that hiscampaign didn't get as many tickets to the event as Bush's forcesdid.   Osborne said after talking with Robertson Friday that itappeared Dole and Robertson made their decision ``in concert.''   ``The only assumption that I can make is Dole has written Texasoff,'' Osborne said.   The fifth GOP candidate dropped out of the presidential race aday before the debate, former Gov. Pete du Pont of Delaware.</TEXT></DOC>
