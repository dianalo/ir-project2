The draft will incorporate the language from issue papershammered out by party staff members and representatives of theMichael Dukakis and Jesse Jackson campaigns at an earlier sessionof the Democratic platform drafting committee.   The platform committee also released two final working papers onnational security and political empowerment. The former reflectsthe Dukakis campaign's insistence that the platform call for``stable'' defense budgets, not the freeze that Jackson wants; thelatter, in a nod to Jackson, commits the party to removing``impediments to the one-person, one-vote principle.''   Rosemary Freeman, executive director of the Democratic PlatformCommittee, said the preliminary draft was still being completed.She said it contains language from the issue papers that emergedfrom the June 10-12 sessions on Mackinac Island, Mich.   Michael Barnes, a former Maryland congressman who is the chiefDukakis liaison with the platform committee, said, ``There will bea draft put before the members Friday morning.'' Referring to theissue papers, he said, ``It pulls them all together.''   But Barnes added that the two sides have not settled differenceson whether the platform should advocate higher taxes on the richand a Pentagon freeze, as Jackson wants.   Whatever emerges Friday from the 16-member drafting committeechaired by Rep. William H. Gray III, D-Pa., will be subject tofurther discussion and revision when the full 186-member PlatformCommittee meets over the weekend in Denver. It will be the firstmeeting for the full committee.   Freeman said the preliminary draft was ``a collective effort''by the same party and campaign representatives who produced theearlier papers on the economy, drugs, education, civil rights andother issues. Gray's group also agreed on Mackinac Island to brandSouth Africa a terrorist state.   The new working paper on national security says:   ``Our strength has been sapped by a defense establishment thathas wasted money on duplicative and dubious new weapons instead ofinvesting more in readiness and mobility. We further believe thatour strength is enhanced by stable defense budgets and by acommitment by our allies to assure their fair share of the costsand responsibilities required to maintain peace and liberty.''   It says the Democrats ``will promote peace and prevent war _ notby trading weapons for hostages, not by sending brave Americans toundefined missions in Lebanon and Honduras ... not by toasting atyrant like Marcos as a disciple of democracy, but by maintaining astable nuclear deterrent sufficient to counter any Soviet threat,in standing up to any American adversary whenever necessary andsitting down with him whenever possible.''   It says the Democrats will promote human rights and ``decryoppression in nations friendly and unfriendly, communist andanti-communist.''   It charges: ``The Republicans abandoned the peace process in theMiddle East and have consistently undermined it in CentralAmerica.''   It calls for ``maintaining the special relationship withIsrael,'' while promoting a Middle East agreement that reflects theCamp David accords.   It says that ``a Democratic administration will end all vestigesof the failed policy of constructive engagement and will declareSouth Africa a terrorist state (and) impose comprehensivesanctions.''   The paper on political empowerment would commit the party to``same-day voter registration'' and registration by mail.   ``We must remove impedidents to the one-person, one-voteprinciple by ending those schemes that dilute the effect of anindividual's vote,'' it says. It also calls for statehood for theDistrict of Columbia, and promises to ``minimize the domination anddistortion of our elections by moneyed interests.''   Jackson, who won 29 percent of the primary votes and has 27percent of the national convention delegates in the latestAssociated Press tally, has complained about the way delegates wereallocated in some states.</TEXT></DOC>
