Additionally, citing his preliminary finding of imminentdanger to the public health and safety, the Administrator ordered the immediatesuspension of DEA Certificate of Registration A90103692 during the pendingof these proceedings. 21 U.S.C. 824(d).Respondent, through counsel, requested a hearing on the issues raised inthe Order to Show Cause and, following the completion of prehearing procedures,the hearing in this matter was held in Miami, Florida on February 11 and12, 1987. On November 10, 1987, Administrative Law Judge Francis L. Youngissued his opinion and recommended ruling, findings of fact, conclusionsof law and decision. On December 15, 1987, Judge Young transmitted therecord of these proceedings to the Administrator. The Administrator hasconsidered this record in its entirety and pursuant to 21 CFR 1316.67,hereby issues his final order in this matter based upon the findings offact and conclusions of law as hereinafter set forth.   The Administrator finds that Carlos Acosta, Jr. was the president of Respondentpharmacy. In April 1984, law enforcement agents followed a large shipmentof ether, a substance used by clandestine laboratory operators in the illicitmanufacture of controlled substances, from a chemical company to a marinalocated directly behind Respondent pharmacy. There, Carlos Acosta was observedunloading containers of ether into a warehouse. On the tailgate of thetruck transporting the ether, a radio frequency detector was found.   The warehouse into which Carlos Acosta was observed unloading the shipmentof ether was subsequently raided. Officers found hydrochloric acid, acetone,garbage pails and filter papers of a size that fits such garbage pails.These chemicles, although they have legitimate uses, are used in the clandestinemanufacture of cocaine. The chemicals and equipment found in the warehousewere all that was required to process cocaine; only the cocaine base itselfwas lacking.   Following the seizure of ether and other materials at the marina, the investigatorsbegan to focus their attention on Carlos Acosta and the two owners of themarina. The preliminary investigation revealed that all three individualshad prior criminal histories.  The investigation revealed that Carlos Acosta, operating out of Respondentpharmacy, purchased chemicals, including ether, acetone and hydrochloricacid, from legitimate chemical industry sources. These materials were storedin either Respondent pharmacy or a storage facility belonging to the marina.Persons engaged in the clandestine manufacture of cocaine purchased ether,acetone, hydrochloric acid and other chemicals or items used in the cocainemanufacturing process from Carlos Acosta. Between March 1979 and December1986, Carlos Acosta received amounts of money in excess of six milliondollars for these chemicals and other supplies. During this period of time,Carlos Acosta utilized Respondent pharmacy as a location to negotiate thesale of these chemicals to clandestine laboratory operators; used the pharmacy'songoing business as a means to order large amounts of chemicals and otheritems from chemical industry suppliers; used the premises of Acosta Pharmacyfor storage of the chemicals and other supplies; distributed the chemicalsand other items from the pharmacy; and, used the premises to receive paymentfor the chemicals and other supplies.   The Administrator also finds, as did the Administrative Law Judge, thatalthough Carlos Acosta was at one time an informant for DEA and its predecessoragency, Mr. Acosta was never directed or authorized to sell chemicals toclandestine laboratories, nor was he authorized to violate the law in anymanner.   As a result of the above-described investigation, Carlos Acosta was arrestedon December 10, 1986. On that date, the Order to Show Cause/Immediate SuspensionOrder was served on the Respondent pharmacy. In conjunction with the serviceof the Order, all controlled substances possessed by the Respondent wereinventoried. The DEA Diversion Investigator conducting the inventory foundthat a very large percentage of the drugs on hand at the pharmacy wereoutdated, having expiration dates of 1976, 1977 and 1978.   Having considered the foregoing facts, the Administrator concludes thatthere are lawful grounds for the revocation of the Respondent's registrationand for the denial of any pending application for renewal of such registration.21 U.S.C. 823(f) and 824(a)(4).   Pharmacy is a profession dedicated to promoting the public health. A pharmacisthas knowledge of the terrible consequences of drug abuse. For a pharmacyowner to participate in a scheme to facilitate the illicit manufactureof drugs is unconscionable. The evidence clearly shows that Carlos Acostaused the Respondent pharmacy to further a large scale effort to supplyclandestine laboratory operators with essential chemicals and other suppliesnecessary for the conversion of cocaine. While this activity had nothingto do with legitimate pharmaceuticals or medicines dispensed by the pharmacy,and while no diversion of such substances has shown, the Administratorhas consistently revoked the registrations of registrants whose criminalactivities relating to controlled substances did not involve diversionor misuse of their registrations. See, <T3>Aaron Moss, D.D.S., </T3>Docket No. 80-2, 45 FR 72850 (1980), a dentistsmuggling cocaine; <T3>Reymond H. Wood, D.D.S., </T3>Docket No. 82-32, 48 FR 48727 (1983),a dentist engaged in marijuana trafficking; <T3>Tilman J.

Based on the foregoing, the Administrator concludes that the continuedregistration of 22nd Avenue Drugs, Inc., t/a Acosta Pharmacy would be contraryto the public interest. Accordingly, the Administrator of the Drug EnforcementAdministration, pursuant to the authority vested in him by 21 U.S.C. 823and 824 and 28 CFR 0.100(b), hereby orders that DEA Certificate of RegistrationA90103692, previously issued to Respondent pharmacy be, and it hereby is,revoked. It is further ordered that any pending applications for renewalbe, and they hereby are, denied.This order is effective March 7, 1988.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: February 1, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John C.
