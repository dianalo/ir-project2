The arbitrators' decision ends years of dispute between IBM, theworld's largest computer company, and Fujitsu, Japan's biggestcomputer maker, over precious information about the internalworkings of IBM's mainframe computers.   Fujitsu will pay IBM a total $237 million and tens of millions ofdollars each year beginning in 1989 under a complex payout plandevised by the arbitration team.   Today's announcement is the biggest development in theIBM-Fujitsu controversy since September 1987, when arbitratorsannounced the initial resolution of IBM's charges that Fujitsuillegally copied IBM software.   IBM's stock price, which had jumped $2.87{ a share on Monday inexpectations of a big payment from Fujitsu, edged back 62{ cents to$118.25 a share by late morning today.   The American Arbitration Association had been holding secrethearings since then to work out the ground rules under which IBMmust grant Fujitsu access to information about the software thatruns IBM mainframe computers.   The rules set by the two arbitrators will make it possible forFujitsu to develop complex, expensive software that controls thebasic operations of IBM mainframe computers.   IBM, which dominates the world market for mainframe computers, isthe only company making the so-called operating system software forits own machines.   The information supplied by IBM also will make it easier forFujitsu to develop its own line of mainframe computers that competewith IBM's by running the same programs. Fujitsu and Hitachi Ltd.are IBM's two main competitors in that market. Hitachi is notcovered by the terms of the IBM-Fujitsu deal.   IBM and Fujitsu issued brief statement today saying they weresatisfied with the results of the arbitration.   IBM first accused Fujitsu in 1982 of illegally copying itsmainframe software. The companies reached a private settlement in1983, but the vaguely worded agreement fell apart and IBM in 1985asked to have the dispute settled by binding arbitration.   IBM and Fujitsu have agreed to let the arbitrators supervise alldisputes growing out of the case until the year 2002.   The arbitrators are Robert H. Mnookin, a Stanford University lawprofessor, and John L. Jones, a computer expert who is a retiredexecutive vice president of Norfolk Southern Corp.   Details of their $237 million-plus payout plan include Fujitsuproviding IBM $396 million for a paid-up license on use of IBMprograms covered under the 1983 agreement, of which Fujitsu alreadyhas paid $125 million.   The arbitrators said Fujitsu also was entitled to a refund of $34million out of the $471 million it had paid IBM under the 1983agreement. Fujitsu had made an intial payment of $65 million andsemi-annual payments of $406 million that ended last year.   In addition, Fujitsu will pay IBM between $26 million and $51million in 1989 for the right to examine information about IBMmainframe software. The amount depends on how much material Fujitsuuses. For years after 1989 the arbitrators will decide how muchFujitsu must pay IBM.</TEXT></DOC>
