In Boston, shefounded Drop-A-Dime, a hot line that acts as a conduit for tips ondrug pushers.   That's terrific. She deserves the whole community's respect andadmiration. There should be more people like her. Not only inBoston, but in any city in any country that has a drug problem. ...   In the motion picture Network, the hero defiantly yelled from awindow that he was ``mad as hell and wasn't going to take itanymore.'' People like Georgette Watson are fed up, too.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 19   The Pittsburgh Press on personal saving habits:   One discouraging aspect of the remarkable U.S. economic boom ofthe 1980s was the decline of personal saving among wage earners.Fortunately, that trend is slowly being reversed.   As a percentage of gross national product, the personal savingsrate in the United States has risen from less than 4 percent in themid-1980s to 5.4 percent this year.   But Americans still lag behind other industrialized nations intheir saving habits. During the presidential campaign, George Bushpromised to encourage saving, and now his administration isconsidering a number of proposals to fulfill the pledge. They maybe onto something.   The proposal currently floating around the White House andTreasury Department, for inclusion in the 1991 budget, istentatively called the Family Savings Account. It would allowpeople of all incomes to contribute as much as $5,000 a year totheir account; after 10 years, the interest and dividends would betax-exempt, although the money could be ... withdrawn. ...   The plan should be attractive to policy-makers. Becauseexemptions wouldn't begin for 10 years, loss of revenues to thegovernment would be incremental and more easily predictable. The$5,000 ceiling would draw more money into the savings pool thanother plans, including the IRA, which sets a $2,000 limit per year.And unlike IRAs, in which savings aren't released until retirement,the family accounts would allow acxcess to savings much sooner.   If the plan has a fault, it's that it doesn't go far enough. ...   We know how Washington hates to lose money. But if greaterpersonal saving is the goal _ and it's a good one _ bolder ideasmay be in order.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 15   Hobbs (N.M.) Daily News-Sun on handgun control:   James Brady is right: Congress is gutless on handgun control.   Speaking before a Senate committee, President Reagan's formerpress secretary, who was shot and permanently injured during JohnHinckley's 1981 assassination attempt on Reagan, charged thatCongress is cowed by the National Rifle Association from passingreasonable gun control laws.   One proposal, which is named after Brady, would require anationwide seven-day waiting period and a police background checkfor all handgun purchases to make sure the buyer had no criminalrecord or was not mentally ill. A week's delay in picking up ahandgun is not unreasonable.   The NRA and its allies on Capitol Hill argue that such a lawwould ``victimize innocent sports people.'' Nonsense. Theinconvenience would be minimal and the benefit could be the savingof hundreds of lives.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 13   The Greenville (S.C.) News on the Philippines:   The serious domestic problems in the Philippines have raisedquestions about continued American support for (President Corazon)Aquino. In the midst of the coup, the Bush administration providedlimited military support for her beleaguered government. Since thenquestions have been raised about whether it's wise for the UnitedStates to strongly ally itself with Aquino's troubledadministration.   It should be noted that there is a difference between supportfor Aquino and support for democracy. The point of American aid tothe Aquino government is that it backs a popularly electedgovernment in the face of an attempt to overthrow it by militaryforce.   If democracy survives in the Philippines, the people will havean opportunity to turn out Corazon Aquino and her government at thepolls. American policy is quite properly based on helping to ensurethe Philippine people have that chance.   After decades of repression under the dictatorship of FerdinandMarcos, freedom in the Philippines is especially fragile. TheUnited States, in keeping with its long and close relationship withthe Philippines, has an obligation to aid the continued developmentof democracy in that country.</TEXT><TEXT>   Dec. 18   Argus Leader, Sioux Falls, S.D., on Leona Helmsley:   As Newsweek magazine once told the story, after Leona Helmsley'sonly son died, she sued his poor widow to get a ring returned.   Reportedly, the billionaire hotel queen also would secretly dropbread crumbs on the dining room floor of her mansion to test theefficiency of the cleaning staff. And she would fire other workerswith little provocation or sympathy.   Most notoriously of all, she once told an employee: ``We don'tpay taxes. Only little people pay taxes.''   It's easy to see why the self-anointed hotel queen of New Yorkhas developed into such a despised person across the United States.   Last week in New York, she finally got what she deserved. U.S.District Judge John Walker sentenced Helmsley to four years inprison and to 750 hours of communited their blood ties, yet spontaneouslysaw something else inhim, calling him ``Lamb of God'' who atones for human wrongs.   Although protesting his unworthiness for it, John baptizedJesus, who insisted on it.   As he emerged dripping from the water, a heavenly glow ``like adove'' descended on him, the account says, and a voice sounded,``This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased.''   Eventually, as Jesus' ministry began, agents of Galilee's KingHerod Antipas seized John the Baptist, imprisoned him in a dungeon,and finally beheaded him at the coaxing of the king's dancingstep-daughter.   Gospel accounts say the imprisonment resulted from John'sattacks on Herod switching wives in a bigamous marriage, butancient Jewish historian Josephus says John also was suspected ofinciting insurrection.   While in prison, John had begun to wonder about Jesus' ministryand sent followers to ask, ``Are you he who is to come or shall welook for another?''   Jesus responded, ``Go and tell John what you hear and see; theblind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansedand the deaf hear ... and the poor have good news preached to them.And blessed is he who takes no offense at me.''   This hinted at possible rivalry between them, but Jesus went onto extol the baptizer.   While Christianity generally has minimized John as simply aforerunner of Jesus, the record shows lingering ties between them.John's influence lasted long afterward in many places as related bythe missionary-apostle Paul.   Jesus, in his preaching, often referred to John, askingchallenging questions about him to stump critics. Somecontemporaries saw Jesus as John's successor, thinking Jesus wasthe baptizer raised from the dead.   Indicating the bracketing of their work, Jesus' apostles onceasked, ``Lord, teach us to pray as John taught his disciples.''   Jesus then recited _ under pressure of John's example _ thatfamous prayer known to all Christianity as the ``Lord's prayer.''   Yet there was a poignant note as John watched his own starfading and that of Jesus brightening. ``He must increase, but Imust decrease,'' John told his followers. Yet ``this joy of mine innow full.''   Grasping the ``historical solidarity between John and Jesus,''writes New Testament scholar W.R. Farmer, ``has become an essentialfirst step toward an understanding of the mission and message ofJesus.''   The baptizer, says the fourth gospel, ``was not the light, butcame to bear witness to the light.''</TEXT><NOTE>Tomorrow: The Galilean Clan</NOTE></DOC>
