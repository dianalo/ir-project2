He had always had good luck job hunting. His field -- personal computers -- was thriving. At 45 years old, with a $43,000 salary and 14 people reporting to him, he felt he was in his prime. He was sure his four months' severance pay was money in the bank.    It wasn't. Thousands of phone calls, hundreds of advertisements, scores of letters and a handful of interviews got him nowhere. He found that companies were firing, not hiring, managers like him. The stock market crash wiped out one promising job lead. A failed corporate deal claimed another. In March, eight months after he was notified his job would end, Mr. Taylor decided to go outside his old field and started training to sell life insurance.    With companies restructuring, scaling back and cutting costs by ridding themselves of managers -- and of the posts they once held -- disappearing jobs are a big problem for job-seeking middle managers. Many once-cosseted managers find their chances of landing jobs like those they lost are slim. So, many take a step backward, forge out on their own or, like Mr. Taylor, switch fields.    In some ways, Mr. Taylor is unique: A Barbados-born black, he is largely self-educated and doesn't have a college degree. Even so, his experience mirrors that of many job-hunting middle managers these days. When he began his search, he agreed to let a reporter chronicle his efforts. Here is a diary.    JULY: The New York offices of Scallop Group, Shell's administrative-services unit, are emptying rapidly. Scallop is merging operations with its parent, eliminating some departments and moving the rest to Houston. Mr. Taylor, who manages Scallop's message center, installing and maintaining personal computers and telex equipment, declines a transfer. &quot;I look at this as an opportunity,&quot; he says. He will work through August, but start job hunting as well.    Scallop has arranged for testing and job-search counseling at outplacement counselors Drake Beam Morin Inc. The Drake Beam psychologist's report is flattering: Mr. Taylor's intelligence tests rate him above 80% of middle managers. Personality tests say he's a workaholic. Interest tests show a strong liking for analysis and order. &quot;You're an ideal client,&quot; the psychologist concludes.    Phyllis Dunham, the counselor who will guide his job search, is impressed with his drive. Mr. Taylor throws himself into his task, listening to tapes of counseling sessions, poring over job-search literature and taking detailed notes on Ms. Dunham's advice.    Together they plot his job search, including answering advertisements and sending mass mailings to would-be employers and executive-search firms. But she pins her hopes mainly on networking, or simply talking to people he knows; even if these contacts don't have jobs to offer, they may know someone who does.    AUGUST: His Scallop job ends, but Mr. Taylor still makes the two-hour commute from his New Jersey home to the Drake Beam office in New York. There, alongside dozens of other recently unemployed managers, he clips ads in New York and New Jersey newspapers for personal-computer specialists. He pores over industry directories and compiles a list of 40 brokerage firms to contact. And he starts phoning friends and relatives. By mid-month he has made 40 contacts, who have given him names of over 100 other people to call.    In 1984, it took him less than two weeks to find the Scallop job, so he's confident he need not take just any opening. &quot;It's not if or when I get a job -- I'm confident I'll get one,&quot; he says. He predicts he will be employed by the end of September. He even hopes to better his salary: &quot;It would be very nice if I could go into the low 50s,&quot; he says. But with many firms cutting back, Ms. Dunham is less optimistic. It may take five or six months to find a new job, she warns.    SEPTEMBER: A weekend in Atlantic City with his wife and son substitutes for a planned trip to Barbados. But because Mr. Taylor expects to be working soon, he doesn't plan any drastic changes in life style. &quot;Maybe in three months I'll worry,&quot; he says, &quot;but not now.&quot;    So far he has called 125 people, and they have pyramided into more contacts. One lead seems promising. A call to an employment agency suggested by an ex-colleague turns up a post being created at an investment bank; Mr. Taylor is perfectly qualified. He sends a resume.    Otherwise, though, ominous signs mount. &quot;People keep saying, 'I'd love to have you work for me, but I don't have the budget,'&quot; he says. A contact at Salomon Brothers Inc. is fired in a cutback. What's more, companies are announcing mergers likely to flood the market with people having Mr. Taylor's kind of skills.    His own deadline passes, and his spirits are flagging: &quot;What's taken so long?,&quot; he wonders. &quot;I must admit I'm totally confused.&quot;    OCTOBER: Finally, some good news. The investment bank wants to interview him; so does a small computer-consulting company in New Jersey that he learned of through a friend of his wife. He also has an interview with a recruiter, another ex-Scallop employee, who is very optimistic about Mr. Taylor's prospects.    Mr. Taylor feels the interview with the investment bank, on Oct. 12, goes well. But a week later, the stock market crashes. The firm's interviewer is now cool; the budget is under review, he says. The ex-Scallop man also drops his optimistic tone. &quot;It doesn't help when I go into Drake Beam and see so many new faces,&quot; Mr. Taylor says. &quot;Sometimes it is hard to keep my head above water. I mean to be in good spirits all the time. But then I get these waves sweep over me and I ask myself what the hell is going on.&quot;    NOVEMBER: He interviews with the consulting company, which is considering using him as an analyst on office-automation projects. &quot;It's precisely what I've done,&quot; Mr. Taylor says.    But his finances are starting to worry him. His severance pay is nearly exhausted; unemployment compensation, $180 a week, will last only two months more. &quot;Another month, and I'll start having to do some part-time work,&quot; he says.    The consulting company offers him a job -- with a catch. It's negotiating a big contract and will hire him once the deal is set. Mr. Taylor doesn't complain that the salary will be $35,000 -- a pay cut of $8,000. &quot;It's just a matter of getting the call now,&quot; he says.    DECEMBER: But when the company contacts him, the news is bad. The would-be client backed out, so there's no contract, and no job.    Mr. Taylor doesn't have the heart to resume job hunting: &quot;Everyone is in parties,&quot; he says. &quot;You can't find anything out. This week is a total bummer.&quot; On Christmas Eve, he is morose: &quot;The dazzle and the lights don't mean much to me.&quot;    JANUARY: His wife, after several years away from work, takes a job in the payroll office of a medical company. Mr. Taylor doesn't go in to Drake Beam much these days. &quot;If I go there and sit there every day,&quot; he says, &quot;I'd just join the club and get into these conversations I overhear: 'I remember my old boss . . . .'&quot; He starts to wonder if his lack of a college degree is holding him back. But Ms. Dunham says he is &quot;experiencing what everyone is experiencing. People are cutting back or only hiring for specific projects.&quot;    FEBRUARY: Mr. Taylor interviews with a real-estate firm that needs help computerizing. He lowers his salary requirement to $30,000, but the interviewer blanches and never calls back. In desperation, he tries selling cars at a General Motors dealership. &quot;The first day, I was there I was there from 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., and they said that's what I could expect -- including Saturday. That's not my thing.&quot; So he quits after one day.    He answers one more ad, this time from Prudential Insurance Co. The work would be commission-based. &quot;They said if I fail or succeed, it's up to me. I said, 'No problem,'&quot; he says. &quot;I've worked too long giving every job I've done my best shot with no credit.&quot;    MARCH: He signs on with Prudential and begins training courses. His supervisor, Jeffrey Glaser, says, &quot;Very few people come into this business thinking, 'This is what I trained for. This is what I wanted to do when I grow up.'&quot; Mr. Glaser joined the agency during the 1982-83 recession, when a family shoe business failed.    APRIL: Mr. Taylor passes state licensing tests and becomes a temporary salesman at Prudential. He has to sell about 10 policies to become permanent -- and he won't get paid until he makes his quota.    MAY/JUNE: He has four policies to go. Mr. Glaser says he has &quot;tremendous potential,&quot; but Mr. Taylor is wary. The slow startup and prospective peak earnings may be fine for a younger person, but leave him cold. &quot;It will take three years to develop a client base, and after that you can earn $50,000,&quot; he says. &quot;I made close to $50,000 before. It's nothing to aspire to.&quot;    JULY: He reaches his quota of policies, and feels proud of how he did it. Many newcomers sell their initial policies to friends and relatives, but most of his sales were to strangers. And more senior salesmen didn't help him with his sales. &quot;Every policy I sold myself,&quot; he says. But doubts remain, especially because of the pay. &quot;I have to wake up in the morning and tell myself to go for it 100%. I'm not gung-ho about it.&quot;    AUGUST: Looking back, he tries to assess what happened. A friend had suggested that he owed his troubles to being black, but Mr. Taylor disagrees: &quot;Being black is more of a mental state than anything else,&quot; he says. &quot;You set yourself up, and you get what you expect.&quot; But he still frets over his relative lack of formal education. &quot;I locked myself out of the job market by not during previous working years taking a course to get a four-year degree. I think I'm responsible for that.&quot;    But he is relieved to be doing something. He figures he sent out 100 letters, answered 200 ads, made 2,500 phone calls and ran through nearly $25,000 in savings for living expenses. &quot;It's been a long, dark road,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
