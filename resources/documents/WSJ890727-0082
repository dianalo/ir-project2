Dan Rostenkowski and top Bush administration officials are negotiating a compromise tax package that would include some sort of reduction in levies on capital gains.    The talks, if successful, would get President Bush and the House Democratic leaders out of a political jam. The two sides have been at loggerheads for a week over whether to give a preferential rate to capital gains.    That stalemate continues. But the fact that the negotiations are being held at all makes it increasingly likely that the House Ways and Means Committee will approve some sort of special tax treatment on the sale of capital assets.    President Bush has lobbied for, and so far won, a majority of votes on the committee for a reduction in the tax rate on capital gains. But the Democrats, led by House Speaker Thomas Foley of Washington state, and Rep. Rostenkowski of Illinois, have said such a cut is unacceptable because it would heavily favor the rich.    Now that they appear to be behind in the vote count, however, the speaker and Rep. Rostenkowski are offering up a more subtle change as a compromise. They are seeking to reduce gains on capital assets by indexing them to inflation before those gains are taxed. The indexing proposal is the centerpiece of a proposal that Rep. Rostenkowski has been discussing with Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady and White House Budget Director Richard Darman.    The political stakes in the disagreement are high. This is the biggest initial test of the Foley speakership. But so far, the two sides haven't come to terms. According to Rep. Rostenkowski, the administration officials are still seeking a cut in the tax rate, probably through the use of a tax exclusion, while he is still pushing indexing. &quot;We're all working toward the same goal. We all want harmony,&quot; Rep. Rostenkowski said yesterday. &quot;What's keeping us apart is rates as opposed to indexing.&quot;    Rep. Rostenkowski, a Democrat, explained that administration officials have so far sought to give capital gains a preferential tax rate, much like a proposal advanced by Rep. Edgar Jenkins (D., Ga.). Mr. Rostenkowski added ominously, &quot;I don't know that rates are even negotiable&quot; for the House Democratic leadership.    Mr. Jenkins's plan, which is supported by the president, would allow individuals to exclude from taxation 30% of their gain from the sale or exchange of long-held assets from July 20, 1989, through Dec. 31, 1991. The exclusion would make the effective top rate on capital gains 19.6%, compared with the current top rate of as much as 33%. After 1991, the top effective tax rate wouldn't exceed 28%, and the assets would be indexed for inflation.    President Bush's proposal has a 45% exclusion, creating a top rate of 15%. The president's plan wouldn't cover real estate or timber; the Jenkins plan would.    Speaker Foley and Rep. Rostenkowski have sought essentially to replace the rate reduction with indexing. While it does lower taxes on capital gains, they see it as more equitable to lower-income taxpayers and more politically palatable to Democrats than introducing a special rate. Rep. Rostenkowski argued that the indexing idea is one &quot;all can all claim victory on.&quot;    But he warned that so far the warring sides haven't accepted his reasoning. Some Democrats in the House, for example, oppose any type of capital-gains tax cut. &quot;Everybody seems to be worried about saving face,&quot; he said.    For his part, Mr. Jenkins said he is open to &quot;possible solutions to work out differences.&quot; But he expressed confidence that his proposal commands an unshakable majority in both the committee and on the House floor. &quot;I'd like to vote. That's all I want,&quot; he said. &quot;I'm interested in a completed project all the way through the process.&quot;    Rep. Rostenkowski said he doesn't intend to call for a vote on any capital-gains proposal until an agreement is reached or it is clear that one can't be. &quot;It doesn't have to come up next week or even the week after,&quot; he said.    But some sort of special treatment for capital gains probably is in the wind. &quot;Any compromise,&quot; Rep. Jenkins said, &quot;would have to have something on capital gains.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
