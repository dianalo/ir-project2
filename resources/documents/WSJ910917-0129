(FDC)</GV><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   None of the proposals for reforming the banking systemcurrently being put forward goes far enough in solving theproblem of &quot;too big to fail.&quot; The American BankersAssociation has proposed instilling discipline in the depositmarket with a program whereby all uninsured depositors --those with more than $100,000 on deposit -- would receive amandatory &quot;haircut&quot; of 15% should their bank fail.   But even this limited injection of discipline, the FederalDeposit Insurance Corp. fears, would be too much for thefinancial markets. The FDIC warned in June that &quot;. . . anytime that the solvency of a bank is questioned, uninsureddepositors can be expected to run. {This} . . . could causean otherwise viable bank to collapse because bank assets areilliquid.&quot; In other words, rather than wait for their&quot;haircut&quot; large depositors would pull their money out of anybank perceived to be shaky.</LP><TEXT>   It is because it fears that a run on any bank could spreadto other banks and threaten the entire system, that the FDICrushes in to cover 100% coverage of all deposits whenever abank of any size is in danger. This was the pattern in theContinental Illinois, First Republic and Bank of New Englandfailures. But dealing with bank runs with 100% insurance isakin to treating a hemorrhaging patient with transfusionsrather than by stopping the bleeding.   Regulators might close banks before runs occur, but theydon't for two reasons: First, depositors will run purely onthe suspicion that a bank's troubles may in fact be fatal,but regulators will not act unless they have something morethan a suspicion. Second, no magic light flashes to indicatethat, as of today, a certain bank is economically insolvent.As a result, regulators let problem banks continue to operateuntil a run occurs. And at that point, the FDIC's onlyrecourse is to announce 100% coverage for all depositors.   Before federal deposit insurance, banks dealt with runs inone of three ways. Insolvent banks simply closed, and thedepositors and creditors fought over the assets thatremained. Solvent banks that were members of clearinghousesor mutual insurance programs received support from theirfellow banks or, after 1914, the Federal Reserve to ride outthe run. Solvent banks that could not receive such supportsuspended or restricted redemption of deposits until thecrisis had passed or assets could be liquidated.   But suspension is not a strategy available to banks today.The inability of a bank to meet its depositors' demands forfunds is one of the legal definitions of insolvency underwhich regulators will close the bank. Simply put, suspensionequals closure by today's rules. Thus we have a dilemma withno apparent solution. The &quot;too big to fail&quot; 100% depositguarantees erode market discipline. A policy of less than100% coverage creates instability, which will drive up thecost to the insurance fund through bank runs. What's neededis a less costly intervention -- a government-mandatedsuspension of payments that leaves open the question ofwhether the bank will eventually be closed.   The suspension plan would work as follows. A national bankthat began to suffer a run on its deposits would notify thecomptroller of the currency. The comptroller, in conjunctionwith the FDIC, would immediately order a suspension ofpayment of more that 85% of any one deposit greater that$100,000. To replace the deposits that do leave, the FDICwould provide 100% coverage for any new deposits coming intothe bank regardless of size, including any discount windowloans from the Federal Reserve. This would eliminate thepresent problem that emergency Fed loans, because they aresecured by the highest quality assets in the banks, reducethe potential &quot;pro rata&quot; distribution to unsecured depositorsin the event of a liquidation and are thus counter-productivein stopping some runs.   The FDIC could also avoid disruption to the paymentssystem by allowing 100% availability of all transactionaccounts. A simple rule might be that accounts that do notearn interest would be fully accessible, whileinterest-bearing accounts would be limited to the 85% cap.   The suspension would remain in effect for no more than 90days or until the comptroller and the FDIC decide whether ornot the bank is economically viable. If the bank is notviable, it would be closed according to present procedures,but with the 15% held back funds available to help offsetlosses, similar to the banking association's plan. If thebank is viable, the regulators would declare it to be so,lift the suspension, and provide 100% coverage for alldeposits for another nine months. Thus the FDIC would put itsmoney behind its decision that the bank should stay open.   The biggest potential problem with this suspension plan isthat runs, particularly of international funds, may becomemore likely if a costly (to the depositor) intervention bythe regulators is more likely. But if the interventiontrigger is quick enough, and sufficient liquidity ismaintained to prevent system-wide runs, so what? Runs havebeen a problem and a source of discipline for bankers sincethe village goldsmiths of the Middle Ages first discoveredthe profit potential of fractional reserve banking. What weneed to do is to restore some of the discipline of bank runswhile limiting their cost.   ---   Mr. Brinkmann, an ex-banker, teaches finance at theUniversity of Houston.</TEXT></DOC>
