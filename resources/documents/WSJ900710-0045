In an interview, Glenn Corlett said that financialpressures on the beleaguered agency, which is still reelingfrom two major client losses, are prompting him to explore anumber of alternatives, including going public.</LP><TEXT>   That admission is startling, considering that Ayer hasrepeatedly stressed its determination to remain independentand private. It also augurs a new direction for Ayer, which,perhaps for the first time, is taking its finances asseriously as it takes its ads.   Mr. Corlett said the likelihood of such a drastic step isprobably less than 50%, but that he nevertheless must give itsome consideration. &quot;Taking this agency public is certainlyone thing we need to look at from time to time. We'vehistorically said we want to remain independent. . . . Butthe fact of the matter is, in this changing world, you haveto re-evaluate that preference regularly. I'm looking atthat.&quot; He added that &quot;the mandate I've been given is,`nothing is out of bounds.'&quot;   Mr. Corlett said he would also consider other options,such as selling a minority stake in Ayer to a foreign firm,or a setup similar to the one between Foote, Cone andamp; Beldingand France's Publicis, in which each holds a minority stakein the other. He said selling all or a majority of Ayer toanother company isn't under consideration. Any of thosealternatives would be a radical departure for Ayer, founded121 years ago and known for its emotional ads for blue-chipclients like American Telephone andamp; Telegraph, General Motorsand Procter andamp; Gamble.   The fact that Mr. Corlett is even considering steps thatmanagement had until recently ruled out categorically pointsup just how distressed the advertising industry has become.Ayer in particular has had a few rough years. Since 1988,U.S. billings have plunged 23%, to an estimated $726 millionfrom $947 million, mostly because of the loss of two hugeaccounts: Burger King in 1989 and Continental Airlinesearlier this year. The agency recently closed its Houstonoffice and last year had to merge its Chicago office with alocal agency there after the Chicago outpost lost almost allits clients.   Mr. Corlett, who became chief financial officer lastmonth, spoke candidly in the interview about Ayer's financialsituation. In the past year, he said, revenue slid 25%,mostly because of the loss of the two clients. At the sametime, New York-based Ayer hasn't cut costs enough to counterthe revenue loss. U.S. payroll costs, for example, havedeclined only 17% since 1988, to an estimated $59 millionthis year. The upshot: While the agency remains profitable,its profitability fell last year and will remain about flatthis year, he said.   Layoffs might seem a reasonable step to improveprofitability. But Ayer, which prides itself on itspaternalistic tradition of avoiding layoffs, is determined topreserve that culture. Considering layoffs &quot;was clearlydiscouraged&quot; by top management, Mr. Corlett said. He said heis hoping to cut costs by attrition, doing away with someduplicated functions and more fully computerizing thecompany.   Meanwhile, Ayer, like other large privately held agencies,must wrestle with how to expand and compete with agenciesthat have access to funds from the public. The mega-agenciesthat grew and merged throughout the 1980s relied on raisingmoney through the public markets. Private agencies had to usetheir own money and bank loans to keep up. Now, with adspending in a stubborn lull and with the economy awash inuncertainty, the private agencies are finding expansiondifficult.   Ayer, for one, used to make acquisitions with internallygenerated cash. But in the past two years, it had to borrowabout $25 million to make several dozen European acquisitionswith a total price tag of over $50 million, Mr. Corlett said.Part of his mandate is to find &quot;economical ways to servicethat debt,&quot; he said, while part is to find new ways tocontinue growing.   &quot;You can raise money from the public markets if you'republic. But if you aren't, you've got a real problem withfinancing that rapid growth,&quot; he said. &quot;We are strugglingunder the issues of how do we finance our growth and controlthe related costs.&quot; He said one possible answer will be tocreate joint ventures abroad, rather than to buy existing adagencies outright. The agency has 71 offices in 41 countriesand owns either the majority or 100% of most of its agenciesabroad.   Emphasizing that Ayer has ruled out selling all or amajority of the agency to an outsider, Mr. Corlett said thatto remain independent, the agency &quot;is willing to accepttightening our belt and a little less profit.&quot;   Mr. Corlett's appointment is a sign that even the mosttraditional Madison Avenue holdouts are taking finances moreseriously. A Price Waterhouse veteran, Mr. Corlett is thefirst Ayer chief financial officer to come from the &quot;outside&quot;and the first who didn't start his career in advertising. Hispredecessor at Ayer, for instance, began as an accountexecutive.   Mr. Corlett also is the first chief financial officer inthe agency's history to be named to the board. The fact thathis predecessors weren't &quot;gives you a hint of what theadvertising people thought of that function -- they didn'thold it in high regard,&quot; he said.   &quot;The financial function is coming out of the closet, andit's becoming a lot more important in terms of whether theagencies can remain competitive,&quot; he said. &quot;Today, in orderto survive and compete, you'd better have effective financialmanagement. It probably hasn't been true before, but in the1990s, it certainly is going to be true. You'll see a lot ofad agencies go out of business because they don't payattention to the financial side.&quot;   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
