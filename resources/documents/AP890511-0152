Criminals ``think threatening the judge will solve theproblem,'' said Bill Dempsey, a spokesman for the Marshals Service.   ``It kind of goes with the turf, unfortunately,'' said OlmstedCounty District Judge Gerard Ring, who received several deaththreats last year after a controversial ruling in the case of ayouthful ax murder suspect.   ``I don't think there's been a judge who's been on the benchmore than a couple years who hasn't had some threats or harassmentof some kind,'' said Anoka County District Judge Lynn Olson.   ``Most of us don't take it very seriously, and perhaps we oughtto,'' said Olson, who is president of the Minnesota District JudgesAssociation.   Authorities announced Monday that an April 26 blast thatseverely damaged the Blooming Prairie home of Freeborn CountyDistrict Judge James Mork was caused by a bomb. The judge, hiswife, and an 18-year-old son were home but escaped injury. PoliceChief Terry Bredeck estimated damage at more than $80,000.   Fifteen miles away, On May 29, 1988, an explosion and firedestroyed Mower County District Court Judge William Nierengarten'shome in Austin. No one was home at the time.   Both judges serve in southeastern Minnesota's Third JudicialDistrict.   ``We can certainly link the two. There's no question of it,''said Pete Mastin, special agent in charge of the St. Paul office ofthe U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.   Steele County Sheriff Bill Hildebrandt said both explosionscaused the same ``crater effect,'' or concussion pattern, and bothblew inward into the houses. Blooming Prairie is in Steele County.   There have been no arrests, and police say they know of nomotive for the two bombings.   Nierengarten does not speak about the incident, his law clerksaid. Mork would not comment, except to express confidence in theinvestigation.   ``By the grace of God we survived the explosion and we arethankful for that. We intend to stand firm and move forward withour lives,'' Mork said.   Meanwhile, threats against federal court officials areincreasing, said Dempsey of the Marshals Service, which hasprotected federal judges for nearly 200 years.   ``At any one time through the United States we have at least onefederal judge under 24-hour protection,'' Dempsey said.   In 1983, 119 threats were received against federal judges,attorneys, jurors and witnesses, Dempsey said. By 1988, the numberhad risen to 213, and 152 threats were reported in the first sixmonths of fiscal 1989, he said.   Dempsey attributes the increase to aggressive law enforcementand increased crime, particularly in drug trafficking.   ``There's a substantial effort throughout the nation of gettingthe criminal off the street and to win the war against drugs andput the drug pushers away,'' he said.   As for threats against state court judges, the National Centerfor State Courts in Williamsburg, Va., does not have statistics.But Phillip Lattimore, a center staff associate, said, ``I thinkthere is a general trend across the country for state courts to bemore security conscious, especially judges.''   In several recent cases:   _ U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner in Miami was temporarily moved fromhis home and placed under tightened security in 1987 after U.S.officials in Colombia reported a threat against his life. Kellnerwas prosecuting Carlos Lehder Rivas, one of the leaders ofColombia's cocaine-smuggling Medellin Cartel.   _ U.S. District Judge Richard Daronco was slain May 21, 1988, athis home in Pelham, N.Y., just north of New York City by a formerNew York City policeman embittered by Daronco's dismissal of hisdaughter's lawsuit.   _ In another Minnesota case, Albert Bolstad was accused in 1987of kidnapping and raping a girl out of revenge against WinonaCounty Attorney Julius Gernes, one of her relatives. Gernes hadtwice helped prosecute Bolstad and his brother.   ``We're in an adversarial system,'' Gernes said. ``If you'regoing to be a forceful advocate, you're going to, in someindividuals, create hostility which manifests itself in assaults orthreats or worse.''</TEXT></DOC>
