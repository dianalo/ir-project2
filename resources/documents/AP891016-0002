When the Met audience gets used to them and thesurprises don't surprise any more, they become favorites.   Zeffirelli's new production of ``La Traviata,'' with the famedGerman conductor Carlos Kleiber and the Czech coloratura EditaGruberova, bowed at the Met on Monday night.   Kleiber made the orchestra sound smooth as silk. In Act 1, hevaried tempi _ he ended the act very fast _ but never put thesingers in jeopardy.   One expected Miss Gruberova to be best in Act 1, where thecoloratura singing is, and less good later. However, her Act 1 wasa bit disappointing and her lyric singing in the later acts waseffective and often pianissimo.   Her top notes are effortless but her voice in coloraturapassages has a rather hard edge. One would like Violetta to have amore womanly quality.   Zeffirelli begins the opera with a prologue showing Violetta onher deathbed. Then the party begins in her house. In mostproductions, her guests leave her to enter the dining room.Zeffirelli sends her into her bedroom to be alone, achieving thisby having the outer circle of the Met's revolving stage move. Act 1alternates between her living room and bedroom. Since Alfredo, whojust met her, marches in to sing with her, this production giveshim more nerve than may be warranted.   Having these two rooms move in and out ultimately seems not toadd anything.   Zeffirelli uses the same ploy in Act 3, at Flora's party. Asumptuous ballroom becomes a small gambling room when dark backwalls slide in from the wings. The party returns to the ballroomwhen the walls slide out. There, we liked the contrast and foundthe change less distracting than a revolving stage.   Act 2 is in a huge garden room with one glass side, beautifulbut reminiscent of a conservatory at a botanic garden. Act 4 hasVioletta's bedroom wall become see-through, letting revelersoutside be seen. And Violetta sings standing and sitting instead ofin bed, as in most productions. This Violetta does a minimum ofcoughing and fainting all evening.   Neil Shicoff sang Alfredo. In Act 1, he was swamped by hissoprano's larger voice. He gained vocal strength later. The lovers'duets were never a marvelous blend. Wolfgang Brendel sang Alfredo'sfather with clarity and an edge which placed his character nearerstern than sympathetic.   Fernando Bujones and Cynthia Harvey danced splendidly in Act 3though their choreography was unexciting. Wendy White, a native ofChicago, who was a 1978 winner of the Metropolitan Opera Auditionsfor Young Singers, made her Met debut as Flora. She managed to makea distinct and favorable impression in that small role.</TEXT></DOC>
