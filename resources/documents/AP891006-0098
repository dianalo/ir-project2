(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker maintained his innocence andsaid he was ``sad but encouraged in God'' after a jury found thePTL founder guilty of using his television ministry to bilkfollowers of $3.7 million.   ``I went into this courthouse several weeks ago saying I wasinnocent of the charges against me,'' a smiling Bakker said afterposting bond Thursday. ``I come out still innocent of the chargesagainst me. I put my faith in God.''   Today, Bakker and his wife, Tammy Faye, left for their home inOrlando, Fla., and their lawyer said they would suspend theirministry for the time being to concentrate on their appeal. But avolunteer answering the telephone there, who declined to give hername, said she knew of no such plans.   The jury foreman said money corrupted Bakker, who prosecutorssaid took $3.7 million in ministry funds and spent it on vacationhomes, Rolls-Royce and Mercedes cars and unusual luxuries like anair-conditioned doghouse.   ``He was called by God. But eventually the money became too muchfor him,'' said Ricky Hill, who said during jury selection that hewas a Christian. ``We kept looking for something from the defenseand we never saw it.''   Bakker faces up to 120 years in prison and $5 million in finesfor his conviction on all 24 counts of fraud and conspiracy. He wascharged with raising $158 million by overselling lodgingguarantees, called ``lifetime partnerships,'' at his Heritage USAretreat.   ``The message is you can't lie to the people and use televisionand the mails to get them to send you money,'' said prosecutorDeborah Smith, a Justice Department fraud specialist. ``It doesn'tmatter who you are or how well known you are, you simply can't doit.''   In an interview today on ``CBS This Morning,'' Smith added, ``Idon't think any conviction is a cause for celebration at all. Ithink it's very sad for his family, very sad for him.'' But shesaid it was saddest for ``the 158,000 people across the country whowere defrauded, many of them of their life savings.''   Bakker's attorney said he would appeal the verdict.   ``We've lost a battle, but we'll win the war,'' lawyer George T.Davis said. ``There was so much negative pretrial publicity that hewas unable to get a fair trial in this community.''   Davis said he would return to Charlotte for the Oct. 24sentencing with ``a surprise for Judge (Robert) Potter. ... I thinkit will be a real suprise. But I can't say now. ... The big day isreally when the sentencing comes.''   He said the Bakkers are ``going to fold up their ministry forthe present and concentrate on the appeal,'' but he declined toelaborate. After leaving PTL, the couple began the Jim and TammyMinistries, which runs a church in Orlando, and conducts afive-day-a-week evangelistic television show seen on eight cableoutlets.   The Bakkers did not appear on the daily television show today,and their replacements did not mention the verdict but closed byurging viewers to ``give your prayers'' to the Bakkers.   Bakker took off his glasses and stared straight ahead as theverdict was read. Mrs. Bakker sat quietly behind him; her eyeswelled with tears.   Outside the courthouse, Mrs. Bakker serenaded a crowd ofhundreds with a verse of ``On Christ, the solid rock, I stand. Allother ground is sinking sand.''   Then she said, ``It's not over till it's over.''   Along with supporters in the crowd were some spectators whoagreed with the verdict.   ``I'm not the smartest man in the world, but when you get caughtwith your hand in the cookie jar you've got to take what'scoming,'' Ira Bostic said.   Later, U.S. District Court Judge Robert Potter released Bakkeron $250,000 bond after expressing concerns that his followers mighttry to help him flee the country.   ``My concern is that his supporters are so zealous that theyhave what I call the Jim Jones mentality,'' Potter said, referringto the cult leader who led hundreds of followers to commit suicidein Guyana a decade ago.   ``They think he can walk on water,'' he said of Bakker'ssupporters.   Potter, known as ``Maximum Bob'' for handing out tough prisonterms and fines, scheduled sentencing for Oct. 24.   On his release, Bakker waded through a crowd of reporters to awaiting white Cadillac and said: ``I feel sad but encouraged inGod.''   Trial testimony showed PTL paid $265,000 to Jessica Hahn tocover up a 1980 sexual encounter with Bakker that led to hisresignation from PTL in 1987.   ``I'm sorry I don't have a song to sing like Tammy but I knowthis is God's amazing grace,'' Ms. Hahn said after the conviction.   Prosecutor Smith called Bakker ``the government's starwitness,'' saying his fraud had been preserved on videotapes of``PTL Club'' broadcasts in which Bakker appealed for $1,000donations in exchange for yearly stays at the retreat and themepark near Fort Mill, S.C.   The government said more than 152,903 partnerships were soldbetween 1984 and 1987 when Bakker had only 258 rooms available, andsome partners testified they were unable to use their lodgingbenefits, although others testifying for the defense said they hadno such problem.   ``Just about every sentence he used he put God in it,'' jurorVivian Ferguson said. ``He kept taking the people's money, and Icouldn't go along with that.''   Bakker was his own worst enemy on the witness stand, jurorDempsey Jones said today on ABC's ``Good Morning America.''   ``His defense testimony was almost like a programmed speech,''Jones sad. ``But when he was cross-examined by the prosecution, itwas really damaging to him _ the halting answers to questions, theobvious not looking at jurors and things like that.''   The trial started Aug. 28 and was interrupted Aug. 31 whenBakker didn't come to court. His psychiatrist told the judge Bakkerwas cowering in a fetal position with his head under a couch.   Potter ordered Bakker sent to the mental hospital at the federalprison at Butner, N.C. On Sept. 6, he was declared fit to resumethe trial.</TEXT></DOC>
