International Lease Finance Corp., a fast-growing concern that buys commercial aircraft to lease to airlines around the world, expects to choose late next week at least 100 planes representing a variety of models. The order is designed to meet the company's fleet needs from 1991 through 1995, according to its president, Steven Udvar-Hazy, who said that with additional options the total number of planes involved would be 120.    Mr. Udvar-Hazy said it is &quot;99% sure&quot; the company will make either an all-Boeing selection, or pick a McDonnell-Airbus combination that would shut out the Seattle-based giant completely.    The planes that International Lease is considering from Airbus, the European consortium, are the A-320, A-330 and A-310 twin jets and the four-engine, long-range A-340. Being offered by St. Louis-based McDonnell are its twin-engine MD-80 and MD-90 series, along with the proposed MD-11 wide-bodied jetliner that, like the A-340, hasn't yet flown.    Mr. Udvar-Hazy said the jets in the package offered by Boeing are the newest models of its 737, 757 and 767 twin-jet series, and the four-engine jumbo 747.    Neither McDonnell nor Airbus alone offers the variety of aircraft sizes and ranges necessary to satisfy International Lease's airline clients, he said, but together the two companies' product lines could produce a selection comparable to the current Boeing offering.    Boeing jetliners probably wouldn't be included in any McDonnell-Airbus order, the International Lease executive added, because that would reduce the per-plane savings available through buying in volume from the other two companies. &quot;We're trying to get a very attractive deal that locks up a lot of aircraft over a four-year period,&quot; he said.    International Lease is negotiating separately with McDonnell and Airbus, and an official of the leasing company said he wasn't sure whether the two aircraft producers were consulting in the presentation of offers. McDonnell and Airbus have had talks in the past about a possible aircraft-manufacturing venture together. But they apparently haven't ever jointly negotiated with aircraft customers, even though Boeing is their common rival.    McDonnell and Boeing declined to comment on International Lease, and Airbus officials couldn't be reached for comment.    International Lease, with a current fleet of 65 aircraft leased to about 30 airlines, has said it expects to have 153 jetliners in its stable by the end of 1990. It has placed orders with Boeing, McDonnell Douglas and Airbus as part of that expansion, while it sells off some older models. Its biggest previous single order was last year's 19-plane purchase of several Boeing models for a total of $1.15 billion.    Mr. Udvar-Hazy said that the order planned for next week would represent about 50% to 60% of its 1991-1995 fleet expansion plans. Thus, he said, even if Boeing isn't involved, International Lease still might be buying Boeing jetliners in future purchases.    Currently flying planes owned by International Lease, which says it orders airliners only when it has firm lease customers for them, are such foreign lines as Lufthansa, Britannia Airways and Air New Zealand, and Trans World Airlines and AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, among other U.S. carriers.    The largest aircraft order to date is thought to be British Airways' $2.3 billion purchase of 16 Boeing 747s in 1986, which would have a value of $4.1 billion if 12 options for other jumbo jets are exercised.    David J. Smith, a Washington, D.C.-based aerospace-industry investment consultant, noted that leasing concerns such as International Lease and Ireland's Guinness Peat Aviation Ltd. have accounted for a growing number of aircraft orders in recent years, and now represent &quot;pretty close to 30% of Boeing's backlog of orders.&quot;    In over-the-counter trading, International Lease shares closed unchanged Friday at $14.875. In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Boeing shares closed at $48, down 25 cents, while McDonnell Douglas closed at $63.875, off 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
