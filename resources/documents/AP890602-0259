She said the danger with alcohol is the abuse of the product,unlike tobacco in which any use of cigarettes can be viewed asharmful.   Surgeon General C. Everett Koop issued a set of proposals thisweek aimed at curbing drunken driving. Koop recommends banningalcohol advertisements on college campuses and halting ads that usecelebrities who appeal to youths.   Also, he said, alcohol advertising should be matched withpro-health and safety messages and he called for an increase inexcise taxes on beer, wine and distilled spirits.   Aside from these proposals, government warning labels will startappearing on alcoholic beverage containers this fall. The labelswill caution pregnant women against drinking and warn how alcoholcan impair the ability to drive.   Government warning labels have appeared on cigarette packagesfor more than 20 years and cigarette ads have been barred fromtelevision and radio since the early 1970s.   Producers of distilled spirits voluntarily have withheld frombroadcast advertising since the early years after Prohibition,unlike beer and wine companies that promote their products on theairwaves.   Some experts say it's unlikely that advertising restrictionssimilar to those on cigarettes would placed on beer and wine.   ``If you took beer (advertisements) off TV, 50 percent of themale population would be on Congress' necks because they wouldn'tbe able to see baseball games on television,'' said Roy Burry, abeverage and tobacco analyst at Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. Inc. in NewYork.   But industry officials nonetheless say they sense politicalpressure to halt broadcast ads of their products.   ``We're concerned about people trying to ban our product from TVand radio,'' said Stephen Lambright, vice president ofAnheuser-Busch Cos. Inc., the nation's largest brewer. ``But thatis not to say we're on a 20-year track behind the tobaccoindustry.''   The surgeon general's office, while discouraging people fromsmoking, is not trying to stop people from drinking, only fromdrinking and driving, said Jim Brown, a spokesman in the office.   But spokesmen for the alcohol industry say they hear a differentmessage.   ``It's a real anti-alcohol campaign,'' said Schneider, of theWine Institute. ``The real issue is to encourage safe drinkinghabits.''   ``We think these recommendations seek to curtail alcohol use,not alcohol abuse,'' said Steve Forsyth, a spokesman for MillerBrewing Co.   Industry officials say they try to promote responsible use oftheir products, but they say Koop is trying to tarnish the image ofalcoholic beverages.   ``He's stigmatized a perfectly legal and legitimate product,''said Lambright at Anheuser-Busch.   It is possible some consumers who see the warning labels andhear the surgeon general's proposals will begin viewing alcohol inthe same light as cigarettes, said Henry Pomeroy, director ofcorporate communications for Hiram Walker-Allied Vintners inDetroit.   But people on both sides of the alcohol issue say cleardistinctions exist between alcoholic beverages and cigarettes.   ``Alcohol problems are suffered by those who don't drink, byvictims of drunken driving,'' said Pat Taylor, director of thealcohol studies project at the Center for Science in the PublicInterest, a consumer advocacy group in Washington that has pushedfor restrictions on alcohol. ``With smoking, the person mostaffected is the smoker.''   Richard Daynard, a law professor at Northeastern University inBoston who has been active in bringing liability suits againsttobacco companies, said the alcohol industry is less vulnerablebecause the beverages themselves pose less of a health hazard thancigarettes.   Also, he said, while cigarette companies insist their productsare safe, alcohol companies acknowledge the potential for abuse.   ``It will certainly help (the alcohol companies) lookresponsible,'' Daynard said of that acknowledgment.</TEXT></DOC>
