Voters must choose from 300 largely obscure delegate candidates_ without knowing the contenders' presidential preferences.   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., has called for changing the system.And Elsie Hillman, who heads George Bush's Pennsylvania operation,said not listing prospective delegates' loyalties is ``absolutelysilly, ridiculous.''   With so many unknown delegate contenders running for a spot atthe national convention, the Republican system places a premium onballot position _ so much so that at least one congressman runningfor delegate believes he may lose because voters won't see his name.   ``I'm running for delegate, but I'm like 17th out of 18 people(on the ballot),'' said Rep. Don Ritter of Lehigh County. ``Isuspect that most people won't get to my name, so it would not beat all surprising to finish very poorly.''   Another delegate candidate, Leonard Falcone of Wyoming, Pa.,called the list of names ``a spaghetti pile'' and said there are somany names in his 11th Congressional District that ``votersactually have to get down on their knees in the balloting box toget to where the delegates are, and I'm last.''   Said Hillman: ``It's going to be a screwy ballot.''   Pennsylvania will send 96 delegates to the GOP convention inAugust. Eighteen of those, including Specter, have already beenpicked by the Republican State Committee.   The rest will be elected Tuesday. The ballot includes a handfulof congressmen, a former congressman, and dozens of local electedofficials. It also includes many candidates making their first runat any office above the city level.   ``I just wanted to get more involved in the political process,''said contender Frank Romeo Jr., vice president of a family-ownedfood distribution firm in Uniontown. ``I'm a committeemen, but I'venever tried to run for anything else.''   Romeo drew poor ballot position _ seventh among seven candidatesvying for three spots in the 22nd Congressional District. Each ofthe state's 23 districts automatically get three delegates, andsome get more based on a complicated formula that considers theirsupport for Ronald Reagan in 1984, among other factors.   Republican State Committee Chairman Earl Baker saidPennsylvania's system evolved out of a desire to give the statemore clout at the convention by holding back committing delegatesto particular candidates.   Baker said in an interview that the method encourages grassrootsinvolvement. If delegates' preferences appeared on the ballot, then``you would take out the local aspect and have a fight betweentickets,'' he said.   Pennsylvania's GOP delegate rules are set by the RepublicanState Committee, and Baker said he saw no reason to change.   But Specter said voters ``are entitled to have commitments.Otherwise, you don't have the will of the people expressed.''   ``It's anti-democratic, with a small `D' and a big `D,' '' saidJon Delano, press secretary to Rep. Doug Walgren, D-Pa. He said hepreferred the Pennsylvania Democrats' system of listing delegateson the ballot according to presidential preference or as``uncommitted.''   Bush is expected to win the lion's share of GOP delegates,mostly because his workers aggressively recruited well-known localfigures to run. Also, the Bush camp recently mailed 300,000 slatecards to Republican voters listing which delegates back the vicepresident.   But supporters of Pat Robertson drew the top ballot position in12 districts.   Of course, Pennsylvania Republicans will also cast their ballotsfor Bush or Robertson. But that ``beauty contest'' portion of theelection has no bearing on delegates.</TEXT></DOC>
