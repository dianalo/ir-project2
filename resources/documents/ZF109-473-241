 The first failure, IBM's OS/2EE.andM;Nobody  would  argue  with Campbell Soup Co.'s 10-year plan to useinformation systems to cut costs, reduce inventory and improve quality.andO;&quot;It's all motherhood and apple pie,&quot; says Alan Carr, director ofmanufacturing systems.andM;But getting agreement from the Camden, N.J.-based company's 39 worldwide isdepartments about how to reach those goals is another matter altogether.andO;Four years into a major overhaul and centralization of itscomputer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) process, Campbell has come to dependmore and more on its corporate is test lab to help build support in the fieldfor the new factory automation project and to accelerate the installationprocess for a centralized CIM management system.andP;  By aggressively using thetest lab, Campbell's is management hopes to finish the project within thenext two years--four years ahead of the original plan.andM;The project is ambitious.andP;  The CIM group at Campbell's information systemsdepartment is working to develop an integrated system that will link higherlevel financial management applications at corporate headquarters to thefactorylevel financial systems  including purchasing, chasing, receiving,inventories, bill payment and payroll processing) at all 39 plant sites.andP;  Itwill also link financial systems to the systems that control the automationprocess on the factory floor.andM;Campbell, established in 1869, generated 5.7 billion in sales last year with55,000 employees worldwide.andP;  Besides the familiar red-and-white canned soup,the company makes Prego spaghetti sauce, Vlasic pickles, Mrs. Paul's fishsticks and Pepperidge Farm breads.andP;  Bringing together the production andfinancial management systems for such diverse and widely scattered operationsinto an integrated system is no easy task.andM;All nine of Campbell's U.S.andP;  plants have brought up CIM factory automationsystems.andP;  But the central financial management system planned for Campbell'scorporate headquarters has stalled.andM;To smooth the transition to a fully automated, corporatewide CIM/financialmanagement system, Campbell's CIM project managers are using a model factoryat the company's headquarters in Camden to serve as a test lab for the newsystems.andP;  The CIM lab houses a duplicate version of the standardized systemthat the plants are adopting and is the locus for changes in is and CIMsystems at all Campbell Soup plants.andP;  It includes a network of 10 PS/2s andan IBM As/400 midrange computer to duplicate the on-site plant systems andprocesses down to the level of the logic controllers on the plant  floor, says  Michael  Cola, Campbell's project manager for CIM.andM;Bug-Free Soup KitchensandM;For the most part, developers at the lab use software to simulate factoryconditions.andP;  But occasionally they modify the test system to duplicate actualproduction processes.andP;  Cola brought in automated scales to measureingredients for Campbell's products during one test project, for example.andO;And the group isn't afraid to use creative substitution, either; recently,the CIM lab's Is staff rigged up a turntable device to pass cans under asensor during development of a product-counting system.andM;Corporate is at Campbell recently launched a formal effort to speeddevelopment of new applications, and the CIM lab is a key part of thateffort.andP;  Virtually all new software and in-house redesigns of existingsystems are tested first in the lab in order to avoid the nightmare ofbringing up new and untried systems on site at operating plants.andP;  Testing newsystems in the lab first also helps decrease time to market, sincesimulations of new production processes can stamp out most bugs before theyshow up in the soup kitchens at Campbell's plant sites.andM;But the lab is likely to play one of its most important roles at Campbell byhelping to convince plant managers and regional is executives to become morewilling participants in the company's plans to integrate and standardize CIMapplications, Cola says.andP;  The lab's contribution in those areas is simple,but crucial.andP;  An already skeptical plant manager, responsible for maintainingproduction schedules, won't be won over by a new application that crashes andbrings manufacturing to a halt.andP;  But by using lab tests to refineinstallation procedures and clear away bugs in advance, Cola hopes toconvince the skeptics that the downtime required to bring up new systems willbe minimal.andM;OS/2 Fails the TestandM;When IBM shipped OS/2 Extended Edition version 1.2 to Campbell in June, thelab proved it could prevent that sort of disaster with the installation ofOS/2.just one week before the new version of OS/2 was scheduled forinstallation at the company's Sacramento, Calif., plant, Cola gave it a testrun at the lab.andP;  The results: &quot;It basically clobbered the network managementsoftware,&quot; he says.andM;The off-the-shelf version of OS/2 that IBM shipped contained a bug most usersmight  never  have  noticed.andP;  But Campbell's system pushed OS/2 further thanIBM's tests had.andP;  &quot;IBM hadn't stretched the envelope as far as we did,&quot;explains Michael T. Moylett, system analyst for the CIM group at Campbell.andO;Cola had to postpone further tests for two weeks to wait for a fix from IBM.andO;That's the kind of experience that makes him shudder at the thought of takinguntested software directly out to a manufacturing plant, he says.andM;By testing first and asking questions later, Campbell's is management hassuccesfully avoided many of the potential problems associated with theinstallation of new systems.andP;  At each of the company's nine U.S.andP;  plants, anIBM AS/400 serves as the host computer and a Token Ring network links aseries of PS/2s running OS/2 Extended Edition to the host.andP;  Prism, aproduction resource planning package from Marcam Corp. of Newton, Mass.,andO;resides on the AS/400.andP;  The manufacturing control software is ONSPEC, fromHeuristics Inc. of Sacramento.andP;  In addition to all nine of Campbell'sU.S.-based food-processing plants-, which have switched over to astandardized CIM system in the last four years, Campbell owns 30 offshoreplants that are still in the process of converting.andM;The next step for the U.S.andP;  plant sites is to tie into a centralizedintegrated management system at Campbell's Camden headquarters, says Moylett.andO;In an attempt to do so, Campbell has entered into a partnership with fourother process-manufacturing firms, IBM and the Industrial Computing DesignsCorp. INCODE) in Reston, Va., to develop a centralized process industrymanagement system called POMS (for Process Operations Management System).andO;However, Campbell's management is taking a go-slow attitude towards POMS anddoesn't expect to have a system installed for at least another two years,says Moylett, if that.andP;  They plan to test the system further at the CIM laband build stronger support among plant site is staff, as well.andM;Is staffers at the off-shore plants fear the new centralized system couldmean reduced autonomy for regional and departmental is personnel.andP;  The trickfor Campbell, says Rob Cohen, director of development services for corporateMIS, is to create the disciplined approach to centralization that will allowintegration of the various plant systems but still leave on-site is officialsthe measure of independence they need to develop creative solutions toproblems unique to individual plants.andM;Support from the regional Is staff isn't the only problem: the newcentralized integrated system also requires that plant engineers work muchmore closely with is than they have in the past.andP;  Such a marriage is notwithout its problems.andP;  One way that Campbell is trying to make the unionbetween is and engineering reasonably smooth, if not blissful, is by hiringCarr, an engineer, away from the Randamp;D shop to manage the CIM project.andP;  In theU.S.andP;  plants, at least, that seems to have been a good move.andP;  Carr says:&quot;There was some confrontation for a while, but we've managed to build aconsensus.&quot;andM;Automation: Not Soup YetandM;Systems management staff at Campbell Soup Co. entered uncharted territorywhen they set about automating all of the company's plant sites around theworld, then tying these site directly to Campbell's corporate headquarters.andO;It's never bee done before, and they had no models to follow.andM;In fact, the process industry still has a long way to go to automateproduction.andP;  Discrete manufacturing-electronics, autos, aircraft and thelike--has generally taken the lead in automating production.andP;  Processmanufacturing-prepared foods, pharmaceuticals and chemicals--has had problemstranslating the analog world of mixing and melding into the digital world ofautomated-manufacturing technology.andP;  And in both types of manufacturing,integrating the management of several plant sites into corporate headquartersstretches the boundaries of traditional is functions.andM;To help develop systems that push past those boundaries, Campbell has joineda consortium that includes IBM, SmithKline andamp; French LaboratoriesInternational, Nestle Food Corp., Johnson andamp;Johnson and Ralston Purina Co. Theconsortium's project, called Process Operations Management System (POMS), isdesigned to provide code needed to seamlessly link the factory floor withcorporate management.andM;In 1988, the consortium launched the Industrial Computing Designs Corp., orINCODE, of Reston, Va., specifically to develop an operating version of POMS.andO;Under the consortium's agreement, INCODE owns the software, and IBM maintainsmarketing rights.andP;  In exchange for their participation, the five processmanufacturers receive an enterprisewide license to use the software.andM;Last summer, Campbell's is management was high on the project.andP;  Because thesoftware is designed for the PS/2 and AS/400 systems--both already installedin nine of Campbell's plants--the food manufacturer expected a quick roll-outonce POMS was shipped.andP;  But POMS was delayed fir six months, and thenCampbell's test lab discovered a bug in OS/2EE version 1.2, the operatingsystem required for its implementation of POMS.andP;  As a result, the company hasbacked off from its plan for a quick test and fast implementation.andP;  Butdespite the late release and subsequent problems with OS/2, INCODE pushedahead and released a developers' version of POMS early this year written towork with the older version of OS/2; INCODE subsequently released a finalversion of POMS in June.andM;The developers' version of POMS wasn't of much use to Campbell, says MichaelT. Moylett, system analyst for the CIM group in Camden.andP;  Developers therecould use it to design some screen displays but not to build the integratedapplicitions--production schedules, formulas, inventory tracking, productcounts and downtime analyses--that require networking capabilities notavailable on the early release, Moylett says.andM;So, now there is no set schedule for POMS implementation at Campbell.andP;  Thesoftware is still being extensively tested at the CIM lab in Camden, andthere is some question as to whether it will ever be installed in the field.andO;MIS management is now considering alternative solutions to the problem ofcentralized CIM management, Moylett says.andP;  Even if the extensive testingreveals no more bugs  and Moylett can solve some apparent incompatibilitiesbetween Campbell's management systems and POMS, the CIM group in Camden isstill not sure that Is management at Campbell's production plants will acceptPOMS.andM;Adds Moylett: &quot;If people don't agree to run it, then it doesn't matter ifit's the best stuff in the world.&quot;andM;CIM Links IS and EngineeringandM;If you're having problems getting support in.andP;  the field for bringing up acompanywide computer-integrated manufacturing system, be sure you've gotstrong support from the top--then crow about it.andP;  &quot;Having champions at highlevels is critical,&quot; says Rob Cohen, Campbell Soup Co.'s director of MISdevelopment services.andM;With top management in their corner, IS an% engineering at Campbell were ableto develop a formal structure to settle the political problems thatinevitably develop when the lines between departmental turfs begin to blur,Cohen says.andM;For starters, when IS execs decided to create a CIM position four years ago,they found their final candidate right in the engineering department: AlanCarr.andP;  Carr was recruited from engineering's research and developmentdivision, where he was working on plant control systems.andM;&quot;The feeling was that MIS had little experience in engineering and plantfloor systems,&quot; says Carr.andP;  By picking Carr, is not only picked Upengineering expertise, it also obtained a direct link to the engineeringdepartment.andM;Carr reinforces the link by talking almost daily with his counterparts inengineering.andP;  Other formal ties between the two departments include regularmeetings between engineering, operations and is to hammer out technicaldetails and periodic, although less frequent, meetings between the vicepresidents of is and en to develop joint policy statements regarding thecompany's move to CIM.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
