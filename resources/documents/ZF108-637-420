Samuelson appeared under theheadline, &quot;What Good Are B-Schools?&quot;andP;  It's not a bad question.andP;  His answer?andO;Not much.andM;Unfortunately, Samuelson seems so incensed about the cost of getting an MBAdegree and the exorbitant salaries commanded by the typical business schoolgraduate that he practically willed the outcome of his analysis.andM;The problem lies with the odd criteria he chose for his evaluation.andP;  Socialutility is his first criterion.andP;  He writes: &quot;For three decades we've run anexperiment on the social utility of business schools.andP;  They've flunked.andM;&quot;If they were improving the quality of management, the results ought to beobvious by now.andP;  They aren't.andP;  Indeed the MBA explosion has coincided with adeterioration in the performance and stature of corporate America.&quot;andM;Is Samuelson suggesting we put the savings and loan disaster and the WallStreet insider trading scandals on the heads of the B-schools?andP;  Theirrationality of this line of reasoning was pointed out by Alfred N. Page, aprofessor of business at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va.andM;Nothing that the rising number of MBAs coincides with the decline ofcommunism, Page asked, &quot;Would Samuelson argue that the outpouring of futuremanagers inspired the communists abroad to just give up and opt for anAmerican-style system?&quot;andM;Samuelson's second criterion has to do with the purpose of business schools.andO;As he put it: &quot;There are two justifications for business schools.andP;  The firstis to generate scholarship that chances our understanding of how businessworks, its wider social effects and how its performance might be improved.andO;Sometimes B-schools fulfill this role brilliantly.andM;&quot;But business schools fail at their second appointed task: training futuremanagers.andP;  The trouble is that it is absurd to think B-schools can teacheither 'business' or 'management.'&quot;andM;Essence 'Lies Elsewhere'andM;I suppose Samuelson is entitled to put the scholarship role of the B-schoolahead of the task of preparing its graduates for careers in business.andM;My assumption always has been that scholarship is secondary and is for thepurpose of enhancing the faculty's ability to educate the students.andP;  But thenagain, that may not always be the faculty's interest.andM;But why does Samuelson conclude that business and management cannot betaught?andP;  Because he believes they are not professions.andM;Samuelson's view is that medicine, law and engineering are professionsbecause they demand mastery of a core body of knowledge.andM;&quot;But the essence of business -- taking sensible risks, creating valuableproducts, motivating people and satisfying customers -- lies elsewhere andcannot be taught in a classroom,&quot; he writes.andM;I would suggest that Samuelson is confusing skill with knowledge, experiencewith education.andP;  Would you want to be treated by a doctor who had not gonethrough an internship program, defended by a lawyer who had not served hisclerkship or fly in a plane designed by an engineer fresh out of school?andM;The essence of any profession is not in the core body of knowledge taught inschools but &quot;lies elsewhere,&quot; to use Samuelson's words.andP;  But where, if not inthe world of experience?andP;  And, if so, can it be taught?andM;Herbert A. Simon, longtime professor of computer science and psychology atCarnegie-Mellon University and winner of the Nobel Prize economics, shedssome light on these questions in his book The Sciences of the Artificial.andM;Simon defines a profession in terms of what the practitioners do, rather thatwhat they know.andP;  &quot;Engineering, medicine, business, architecture, and paintingare concerned not with the necessary but with the contingent -- not with howthings are but with how they might be -- in short, with design,&quot; he writes inthe preface.andM;Elsewhere in the same book he writes: &quot;Everyone designs who devises coursesof action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.andP;  Theintellectual activity that produces material artifacts is no differentfundamentally from the one that prescribes remedies for a sick patient or theone that devises a new sales plan for a company or a social welfare policyfor a state.andM;&quot;Design, so construed, is the core of all professional training; it is theprincipal mark that distinguishes the professions from the sciences.&quot;andM;The question remains, can management be taught and how?andM;The Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technologyand the Harvard Business School at one time epitomized opposing teachingphilosophies.andP;  The Harvard Business School used case studies to bringempirical substance into the curriculum.andP;  The Sloan School taughtdecision-making using mathematical modeling and computer simulation.andP;  Mostschools today use a blend of the two approaches.andM;Flailing vs.andP;  PushupsandM;Some years ago, in a debate on their relative merits between panels from eachof the two schools, it was an MIT professor who best captured the essence ofthe problem.andP;  As I remember, he said essentially the following:andM;&quot;What we are trying to do is similar to the problem of teaching someone howto swim without getting them in the water.andP;  The difference is that at Harvardyou have them stand in a shower and flail their arms around while at MIT weteach them hydrodynamics and have them do pushups.&quot;andM;So much for what the business schools do.andP;  But this really doesn't answer thequestion, what good are B-schools?andP;  For that matter neither does Samuelson'scolumn.andP;  In fact, I thought he had a better answer in another column, which Iwonder if he remembers writing, in January 1969:andM;&quot;Our folk heroes are no longer the Horatio Alger characters who luck outtheir way to business success by rescuing and marrying the bosses' daughters.andO;Actually in the meritocracy of the corporate jungle, a Harvard MBA is worthmore today than blood relationship with the constitutional monarch who chairsthe board from age 60 to 65.andP;  If you don't believe it, listen in at thecountry club.&quot;andM;Like it or not, twenty years later, that's still the way it is.andP;  Only theprice has gone up.andM;Frank Carr retired from the General Services Administration in 1988.andP;  Ascommissioner of GSA's Information Resources Management Service, he was thefederal government's top information technology procurement official.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
