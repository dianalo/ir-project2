Fragrance manufacturers have been frustrated for years by a strong Japanese bias against perfuming the body. Though fragrances account for over 25% of cosmetics revenues in the U.S. market, they make up a mere 3% of the Japanese market.    But now 22 French perfume companies, including Christian Dior Perfumes Inc. and Yves Saint Laurent, have formed a trade group called Prestige de la Parfumerie Francaise in a bid to expand their share. The group is offering awards for poems and essays on perfume and distributing brochures on how and when to use fragrances. Japanese &quot;opinion leaders&quot; from economists to television personalities have been enlisted to champion perfume in TV, radio and print ads.    &quot;Be less Japanese. Be more French. That's the main message,&quot; says Rolf Vogel, president of Chanel Inc.'s Japanese unit. &quot;Enjoy fragrance.&quot;    But overcoming the age-old taboo may be tough. &quot;Japanese are group people,&quot; Mr. Vogel says. &quot;No one wants to stand out.&quot; Most find fragrance at dinner offensive, he says, and men associate it with &quot;the night-club business. It's more for bar girls.&quot;    Computer-Aided Picks   At the Makeup Counter   MANY WOMEN don't trust themselves to select makeup. But maybe they'll trust computers. That, at least, is what cosmetics companies are hoping.    With the profusion of new makeup products, women often have trouble making choices. Rather than choose wrong, many stick with brands they know.    To help overcome this anxiety, Avon Products Inc. has introduced a &quot;beauty vision personal computer.&quot; A light meter examines a woman's skin to determine its tint. Using other data on her coloring and age, the computer produces printouts with color recommendations for &quot;casual,&quot; &quot;polished&quot; and &quot;evening&quot; looks.    Noxell Corp., which already has computers, recently started an ad campaign for its Clarion cosmetics line that touts the machines' ability to make the &quot;right&quot; choice.    Shiseido Corp., to supplement its &quot;replica skin diagnosis&quot; machine and &quot;makeup simulator,&quot; plans to introduce a &quot;direct skin sensor&quot; next fall. The sensor projects a magnified image of the surface of a customer's skin onto a screen, showing pores and furrows. Sales clerks suggest purchases based on the image.    Joseph Kozloff, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., calls computers &quot;clever selling tools. But we're talking marketing here, not science.&quot;    Simple Innovation   In Eye Coloring   THE NEWEST COLOR in mascara is no color, and it's catching on quickly.    Promising longer, thicker eyelashes and &quot;no more raccoon eyes,&quot; Max Factor andamp; Co. introduced &quot;No Color Mascara&quot; last spring. The response was &quot;phenomenal,&quot; the Revlon unit says, with a projected six-month supply exhausted in two weeks. Maybelline Co., Estee Lauder Inc. and Aziza, a unit of Unilever N.V., have since brought out similar products.    The appeal of fuller lashes without mud smudges is attracting men too, Max Factor says, since they can use the product without being detected.    But it's not for everyone. Clear mascara doesn't help fair-haired people seeking lash definition. And &quot;if somebody wants that gloppy, glamorous look, (No Color) isn't a substitute,&quot; says a Max Factor spokesman.    Borrowing Too Much   From Medicine?    COSMETICS MAKERS like to borrow ideas from the medical profession. But it can put them on thin ice.    Consider free radicals -- ubiquitous, highly reactive oxygen molecules that kill cells. Some scientists think ingesting chemicals known as anti-oxidants may limit the damage. But there is no consensus on how, or whether, antioxidants work.    That hasn't stopped cosmetics companies from pushing anti-oxidants. Line Preventor, a $45 &quot;free radical scavenger&quot; lotion, is the biggest seller at Estee Lauder's Prescriptives unit. Revlon offers Age-Less &quot;anti-aging daily face capsules&quot; that claim to block free radical formation for $27.50 a package. And Revlon's Respirar O2 moisturizer contains &quot;NAO, Revlon's exclusive patent-pending natural free radical interceptor.&quot;    But Food and Drug Administration officials are watching closely to see if the companies make excessive claims for such products. While many scientists say free radicals cause damage inside skin cells, Heinz Eiermann, director of the FDA's cosmetics division, says they haven't been shown to cause wrinkles. Besides, he adds, there's no reason to think anti-oxidants smeared on the skin have any impact inside skin cells. And if the products were active inside the cells, they'd have to be classified as drugs, not cosmetics.    The FDA recently sent a warning letter to Estee Lauder about Line Preventor. Mr. Eiermann says the company treads the line between cosmetics and drugs by claiming that the product provides resistance to wrinkles and aging. An Estee Lauder spokesman says the company intends to comply with FDA requests to change its packaging.    Revlon hasn't been cited for its year-old Age-Less capsules, but &quot;anti-aging is a trigger word,&quot; says Mr. Eiermann, and continued use of the term could earn the company a letter from the FDA. A Revlon spokesman says, &quot;We're always very cautious about our claims.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
