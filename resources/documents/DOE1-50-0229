The exact locationhas a decisive influence on the profitability of a wind turbine project.By means of the Wind Atlas the annual energy production from a giventurbine at a given site can be estimated. In siting, a number of conflictinginterests must be weighed against each other. For the large-scale productionof electricity, wind farms are required. In Denmark a national localisationsurvey for wind farms producing 4 TWh/year was carried out. The studydelimitates 28 areas within which the first 250 wind turbines, each ratedat 2.5 MW, can produce 2 TWh/year. The possibility of offshore sitinghas been investigated as well as the attitudes of the local politiciansand the citizens towards a wind farm. The marketing of larger and cheaperwind turbines makes the inclusion of wind energy in physical planningdifficult.</TEXT></DOC>
