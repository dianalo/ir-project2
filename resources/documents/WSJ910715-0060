Friday, paying apremium of $12.8 million and gaining its first real entreeinto the huge Texas market.   The banking behemoth, which has been expanding outsideCalifornia by snapping up moribund thrifts from the federalsavings and loan cleanup agency, tipped its hand on Texas inMay when it purchased the tiny Village Green National Bank ofHouston from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. for a $1.8million premium. That purchase gave BankAmerica the bankingcharter it needed under Texas law to start doing business inthe state.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's a peanut,&quot; Dick Fredericks, an analyst withMontgomery Securities, said of Commerce Federal Savings,which has assets of $401.2 million and deposits of $775million. &quot;They {BankAmerica} are dipping their toe in thewater.&quot;   Analysts predicted more of BankAmerica's toes would soonfollow. &quot;Presumably, this is just a first shot,&quot; Don Crowley,an analyst with Keefe Bruyette andamp; Woods Inc., said. &quot;They'veclearly shown an interest in Texas,&quot; which is the secondmajor banking market in the West after California.   Under the terms of the transaction, BankAmerica willacquire all of Commerce Federal's deposits and $29 million ofits assets, primarily cash and cash equivalents and loanssecured by deposits. It doesn't retain the right to sell backany portion of the assets to the RTC, a spokeswoman said. The$12.8 premium BankAmerica paid for the thrift represents 2.5%of the failed institution's core, or local retail, deposits,which is on the low end for such transactions. (Premiums aregenerally seen to be a good deal when they represent 3% to 6%of core deposits.)   The RTC said it selected BankAmerica because its proposalwas the least costly of four bids for Commerce Federal.   BankAmerica's strategy of paying a small premium to becomea large state player has been unfolded for some time now, asthe bank cuts a swath across the Western states. &quot;They'vealmost worked their way up the Southwestern corridor,&quot; Mr.Crowley said. &quot;Texas is the logical next step.&quot;   With the acquisition, BankAmerica follows other big banksand thrifts that have been cherry-picking in the San Antoniothrift market. The city's biggest thrift, San Antonio SavingsAssociation, was sold in March 1990 to a unit of FirstGibraltar Holdings Inc., whose parent is controlled by RevlonInc.'s chairman, Ronald O. Perelman. BancOne Corp. picked upFirst State Federal Savings Association, a $248.8 million SanAntonio thrift, in May 1990. Last month, NCNB Corp.'s Texasbank received a transfer of deposits from the San Antoniobranch of Commonwealth Federal Savings Association of Dallas.   Last year, Commerce Federal posted a $49.6 million loss,the largest single loss of any savings and loan institutionin the San Antonio area, a locality that has only one thriftleft that hasn't failed or been taken over by the federalgovernment. Commerce Federal was placed under federalconservatorship in March 1989 and taken over by the RTC inSeptember 1990.   &quot;We're eager to serve the Texas market, which we believehas tremendous potential, and this acquisition enables us toestablish a presence in key areas of the state,&quot; saidBankAmerica executive vice president Jerry L. Bowman, head ofBankAmerica's interstate banking division.   A spokeswoman for BankAmerica said that while CommerceFederal is based in San Antonio, most of its 18 branches arein Dallas, Fort Worth and Houston, big markets thatBankAmerica is eager to enter. The bank plans to retain allbranch employees, she said.   BankAmerica now has about 1,300 branches in Arizona,California, Idaho, Nevada, New Mexico, Oregon, Texas, Utah,and Washington.   ---   Christi Harlan in Dallas contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
