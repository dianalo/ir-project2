It is requiredfor a geothermal water DHP to deal with corrosive geothermal water ofhigh temperature and high pressure and install to operate a very slenderpump motor with large capacity inside a narrow drill hole. Ebara ManufacturingCo. had almost finished its technological research of elements of DHPand based upon its results, manufactured experimentally the test machineNo.1 with the aim to fulfill the following values; actual inner diameterof well; 224mm, hot water temperature; 170{sup 0}C, hot water flow; 50t/h,pump head; 300m, depth of installation position; 400m, and driving apparatus;100KW. In August 1986, its plant tests consisting of a 500 hoursrun withhot water of 140{sup 0}C and a 2,000 hour run with hot water of 170{sup0}C were successfully completed and following the plant tests, the machineis now on the spot trial at Kuju Town.
