Arthur G. Lang III, president, and Thomas C. Trexler,chief financial officer of Landover, Md.-based Insituform,were accused of hiding their company's losses in 1986, thenselling their shares before disclosing the company's truevalue.</LP><TEXT>   The case attracted considerable attention because of thepre-trial defense arguments. Mr. Trexler's attorneys at theWashington, D.C., law firm of Wilmer, Cutler andamp; Pickeringargued that Congress never intended to make insider trading acrime when it passed to Securities and Exchange Act in 1934.According to the attorneys, Congress created only civilliability for corporate insiders who broke the rules. TheSEC's later rule making insider trading a federal crime wasillegal, the lawyers argued, because the SEC overstepped itslegal authority in drafting it.   U.S. District Judge William Nickerson dismissed thatargument. At trial, defense lawyers argued the facts, sayingthat neither defendant could be convicted of insider tradingunless the government could first prove that he manipulatedthe company's books.   The case was prosecuted by U.S. Attorney Breckenridge L.Wilcox, who could not be reached for comment. His assistantCarmina S. Hughes declined to comment.</TEXT></DOC>
