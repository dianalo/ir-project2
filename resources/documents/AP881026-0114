Dr. Mary Jo O'Sullivan, a member of an ACOG panel that developedthe guidelines, said a pregnant women who has had an earlier childby Caesarean section ``should be encouraged to attempt labor in hercurrent pregnancy'' instead of routinely undergoing a secondsurgical delivery.   ``This is the first time in over 70 years we are saying that apatient who has had a C-section should not have a repeat C-sectionunless there is a definite medical need,'' she said at a newsconference.   The significant shift of emphasis stems from a gradual increaseof statistical data that shows mothers and babies generally farebetter with vaginal delivery _ even if the mother has previously hada low transverse incision C-section, she said.   As with any surgical procedure, C-sections are more costly thannatural delivery and raise the prospect of the same type ofpotential complications always attendant surgery, such as infectionsand reactions to anthesia.   Dr. O'Sullivan said if the new guidelines are accepted by U.S.hospitals, they will go a long way toward ending the ``once aC-section, always a C-section'' tradition that has guided obstetricpractice since 1916.   The ACOG committee found that women who have had a C-section bythe low-transverse method were successful in subsequent vaginaldelivery attempts in most cases.   ``Up to 70 percent of these women who had their first Caesareanbirth because of failure to progress in a long and difficult laborwere able to deliver vaginally with their second child,'' Dr.O'Sullivan said.   Since 1982, the ACOG has urged physicians to encourage women toattempt vaginal deliveries even after prior C-sections. The actionwas taken after a number of studies indicated that mortality ratesfor mother and child were lower among women who attempted labor thanamong those who chose repeated Caesarean births.   Until recent years, it was believed that once a woman had had aC-section, all subsequent children had to be delivered the same way.The number of C-sections routinely performed in recent years,however, has declined and the new guidelines are intended toencourage this trend.   In 1987, about 24.4 percent of all live births, or 934,000 of 3.8million, were performed by C-section. About 35 percent of thesurgical births were repeat C-sections.   The surgical procedure would continue to be used where medicallyindicated, such as for some breech births, when there are signs thatthe baby is in distress, or following a difficult and prolongedattempt at labor.   The ACOG announcement said C-sections will continue to be usedfor women who have had a previous ``classical'' Caesarean. In thisprocedure, the uterus is incised vertically, a technique now rarelyused. About 99 percent of all C-sections now use a transverseincision which goes from one side to the other, instead of up anddown.</TEXT></DOC>
