Army officials say they need $29 million to expand the NationalTraining Center at Fort Irwin, next to Death Valley in California.By comparison, the Base Alignments and Closing Commission has said$693 million can be saved annually by shutting the facilities itrecommended.   Outgoing Defense Secretary Frank C. Carlucci has already sent thecommission's recommendations on base closings to Congress, whichtake effect unless blocked by both houses. Senior lawmakers sayrejection of the package is unlikely.   Likewise, Congress has not objected to the Army's plans to buy200,000 acres adjacent to the 632,000-acre Fort Irwin.   The expansion conforms with the commission's expression of``acute concern about the requirement of the Armed Forces foradequate training areas.''   None of the bases recommended for closing were large enough forlarge-scale maneuvers, said Paul W. Johnson, deputy assistant Armysecretary for installations and housing.   In addition to buying land at Fort Irwin, Johnson said, the Armyis considering a 63,000-acre expansion of a training facility atYakima, Wash., and needs yet another major training center of atleast 600,000 acres.   Current budget requests do not contain money for acquiring thesecond major training facility, which likely would be a jointproject by the Air Force and the Army, Johnson said in an interview.   ``It's not in the five-year plan yet,'' he said.   Two problems cited repeatedly by Pentagon and commissionofficials are that bases established in remote areas during WorldWar II are now surrounded by dense populations, and that theservices require more land to train with increasingly faster, morepowerful and more sophisticated weaponry.   ``The increasing sophistication and extended ranges of modernweapons continually increase the requirements for training areas,''said the commission report, issued last month.   ``The five nautical miles required by a World War II fighteraircraft for aerial maneuver have grown to 40 miles today,'' thereport said. That range will extend to 100 miles as the servicesintroduce the next generation of fighters over the next decade, itsaid.   Similarly, ``an Army mechanized battalion needs more than 80,000acres to practice standard maneuvers; its World War II predecessorrequired fewer than 4,000,'' it said.   For Army brigades, consisting of two or more battalions, FortIrwin is the only base large enough to train with high speed M-1Abrams tanks and Bradley fighting vehicles, said Johnson.   While the torrid desert conditions at Fort Irwin provide goodtraining for the Middle East and Southwest Asia, said Army spokesmanLt. Col. Robert Millard, it is not ideal for troops practicing to dobattle in Europe.   ``Ideally, the land should resemble the terrain you intend tofight on,'' said Millard, interviewed jointly with Johnson.   The need for maneuvering room seems to have crept up on Army inthe 1960's and 1970's. In 1971, the Army turned Fort Irwin over tothe National Guard. Realizing the need for open spaces, the Armyreclaimed Fort Irwin in 1981, and now counts it among its keyfacilities around the globe.   The need for bigger training spaces also affects other majorpowers.   ``The commission notes in passing that Soviet forces have attheir disposal vast training areas in which to practice large-unitmaneuvers,'' the base closing report said.   Great Britain and West Germany train in the vast expanses ofCanada, said Capt. Don Roy, a spokesman for the Canadian military.   Britain and West Germany keep permanent detachments of tanks atSuffield, Alberta, on the Canadian plains, and they stage airmaneuvers at Goose Bay, Labrador, which has huge flying ranges thatare one-third the size of the whole of West Germany.   U.S. Army officials said they have not discussed with theCanadian government the possibility of joint maneuvers in Canada.   While its ships obviously do not have space constraints at sea,the Navy tried to solve maneuvering problems faced by its land-basedpilots by purchasing a huge tract at the Lemoore Naval Air Stationin the San Joaquin Valley of California in the 1950's, said retiredAdm. Wesley McDonald, a former deputy Chief of Naval Operations foraviation.   Lemoore opened July 8, 1961, on an alkaline patch surrounded byfarmland 45 miles south of Fresno, said base spokesman DennisMcGrath.</TEXT></DOC>
