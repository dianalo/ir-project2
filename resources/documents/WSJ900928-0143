The bignoise last academic year was Stephen Sondheim's stint as thebrand-new professor of drama. Just before the beginning ofthe university term this autumn, Oxford had a visit fromJulia Child.   America's best-known television cook was here to attendwhat may well have been the 10th Oxford Symposium on Food.(There is a question as to whether to count the first meetingin 1979, as it was not open to the public.) The symposiums --organized by Alan Davidson, a former British ambassador toLaos who is now writing the several-million-word &quot;OxfordCompanion to Food,&quot; and Theodore Zeldin, the eminenthistorian of France and star of French television -- havebeen copied and emulated all over the globe, from Turkey toNorway and from Sydney to Boston.</LP><TEXT>   Eccentricity is the hallmark of the Oxford meeting. Pastsymposiasts have been treated to a lecture in which anarchaeologist claimed to have found the first loaf of breadever baked; to a taste of the soup Count Rumford invented tofeed the obstreperous professional beggars of Bavaria whosedemands were undermining the social order; to accounts ofcannibalism replete with tasting notes on the flesh ofdifferent races; and to learned disquisitions on the originsof cooking vessels, table manners, food taboos, nutritionalfads and farming practices. The participants take an especialdelight in apparent pedantry; for the most specific, arcanelytitled, off-the-wall papers almost always turn out to be themost exciting and interesting.   Connoisseurs remember the paper delivered by CharlesPerry, once a rock-music journalist, on medieval Persianrotted condiments, which were lethal to consume. Mr. Perryappeared again this year, but his learned and literatedisquisition on &quot;Elements of Arab Feasting,&quot; though notdisappointing, lacked the night-of-the-living-dead luridnessof his classic performances.   &quot;Feasting and Fasting&quot; was the theme of this year'smeeting, and, true to form, contributions on &quot;The Way theContemporary Western Assyrians Take Food in the Middle EastDuring Fasts and Church Holidays&quot; and &quot;Fasting and Feastingamong Oregon's Russian Old Believers&quot; were among the moststirring. Mrs. Child (who had begun her first visit to theOxford Symposium with a dinner at Oxfordshire's bestrestaurant, Raymond Blanc's Manoir aux Quat' Saisons) seemedparticularly amused by the paper on &quot;The Black or HellBanquet,&quot; presented by Phyllis P. Bober of Bryn Mawr College.   But the great event for Mrs. Child, as for everyone elsewho attended the session, was the very last paper, &quot;TheBayeux Tapestry Sish-Kebab Mystery,&quot; by Robert Chenciner, anassociate member of St. Antony's College, the perennial siteof the symposium. Mr. Chenciner, by profession a financialconsultant, also is an art historian specializing in carpetsand ancient textiles. His interest in food is purelyavocational.   He set himself the subject of examining the panel in theBayeux Tapestry (actually &quot;a wool embroidery on fine linentabby,&quot; which is a fabric in plain weave) -- depicting an11th-century Norman feast. Mr. Chenciner was at firstintrigued by the fact that &quot;one of the cooks is looking aftershish kebabs of meat cubes and small fowl, spread out like aspring chicken, being grilled over a box-shaped containerwith three shelves and rings protruding on each side of thetop supported by a low (about eight-inch) tripod over afire.&quot;   This barbecue was Mr. Chenciner's first puzzle. How hadkebabs traveled from the Near East to Norman France andEngland? As other symposium participants quickly pointed out(and as Mr. Chenciner was clearly aware), the kebabs were ared herring. Since cooking bits of meat on a stick over anopen fire was almost certainly the chief culinary standby ofprimitive man, one cannot assume that, because the techniqueis at present associated with the Middle East, it must haveoriginated there.   Indeed, as Mr. Chenciner made clear, the kebabs soonbecame merely an excuse for discussing the embroidery itselfin front of a conclave of gastronomes. By a series of elegantarguments, he prepared his audience for the bombshell he thendropped. Everyone who has ever seen the Bayeux Tapestry hasremarked on how fresh, even new, it looks, and on its goodstate of repair.   The reason for this, Mr. Chenciner argued cogently, isthat it is a modern copy, probably made in the early 18thcentury about 1710, and possibly incorporating the originaltapestry. There is no outline drawing in the Bayeux Tapestry,&quot;just pricked through holes,&quot;Mr. Chenciner points out, &quot;ausual method of copying, though not necessarily of designingembroidery.&quot; This led him to speculate that the originalmight have been mounted onto the linen backing and used as atemplate for the copy.   Despite the lack of slide-projection equipment (as well asamplification, which caused Mrs. Child, a daughter ofSouthern California, to remark that the &quot;production values&quot;of the symposium could have been higher), Mr. Chenciner'sremarks achieved the dramatic effect intended, and theaudience was electrified.   It was duly noted that the authorities have thus farrefused to allow the Bayeux Tapestry to be carbon-dated, afact that seemed outrageous to veteran symposiast NicholasKurti, emeritus professor of physics at Oxford.   After it was all over, I asked Mrs. Child -- who had beena guest of honor at the symposium, and who had made a briefand charming speech at the Saturday-night dinner thatfeatured English food (with a main course of boiled mutton)-- if she had enjoyed the proceedings. &quot;I have never,&quot; shereplied in her familiar, slightly breathless voice,&quot;experienced a conference quite like this.&quot; Lest this be opento misinterpretation, she immediately added, &quot;and I amdefinitely coming back next year.&quot;   ---   Mr. Levy writes about food and wine for the Observer inLondon.</TEXT></DOC>
