LOUIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   May Department Stores Co. said it agreed to sell its Sycamore Specialty Store division in a leveraged buyout to a group of investors that includes senior management of the division. Terms weren't disclosed.    May, a retail concern that acquired Sycamore in its $2.38 billion acquisition of Associated Dry Goods Corp. last year, said Sycamore had 1986 sales of $40 million and has 1,000 employees. Sycamore has 111 stores that sell women's apparel in Indiana, Ohio, Illinois, Kentucky and Michigan.    In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    In the fiscal year ended Jan. 31, May Stores had sales of $10.3 billion.    The sale is expected to be completed this month, the company said. </TEXT></DOC>
