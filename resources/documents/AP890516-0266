The Federal Reserve sold some dollars, but traders were dividedon whether the central bank's intervention was an important factorin halting the currency's rise.   The dollar finished higher against the French franc and Italianlira but slightly lower against other major currencies.   On Monday the dollar had reached its highest point against theWest German mark since the end of 1986 and its highest pointagainst the Japanese yen since November 1987. In one week thedollar had tacked on 2.2 percent against each currency.   ``The market is still bullish. Customers are willing to buy thedollar and are looking for numbers to buy it,'' said Frank Conte, avice president at Barclays Bank PLC in New York.   The Commerce Department was scheduled to report on the Marchmerchandise trade deficit on Wednesday and the Labor Department wasto announce figures on April consumer prices on Thursday.   Although currency traders largely have ignored trade figures inrecent months, a particularly large deficit figure might be enoughto puncture the bubble of the recent speculative run-up in thedollar, some traders believe.   A big increase in consumer prices might actually help the dollarby increasing the chance the Federal Reserve would push up interestrates, something that makes dollar-denominated investments moreattractive.
