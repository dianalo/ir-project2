<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-15-1108 </DOCNO><TEXT>Model calculations with different marginal conditions and different physicalprocesses do, on the basis of realistic assumptions, result in a temperaturerise of 3 +- 1.5degC at doubling carbon dioxide concentrations. Temperaturesare increasing even more due to the presence of trace gases contributingto the greenhouse effect. They are assumed to be having a share of 100%in the carbon dioxide effect (additive) in 30-40 years from now. Accordingto the model calculations the CO/sub 2/ increase from about 280 ppm around1850 to 345 ppm (1985) is equal to a globally averaged temperature riseof 0.5-0.7degC. As the data obtained before 1900 were incomplete andlittle representative climatic analyses cannot be considered to havebeen effective but after that time. However, considering the additionalinfluence of other climatic effects such as vulcanism the temperaturerise satisfactorily corresponds to the values obtained since 1900.</TEXT></DOC>
