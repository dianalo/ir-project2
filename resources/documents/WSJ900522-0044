The U.S. unit also rose against the yen and othercurrencies on the market's perception that the FederalReserve won't act to reduce U.S. interest rates any timesoon, participants said.</LP><TEXT>   Rejection by the West German Social Democratic Party, orSPD, of the current version of the Germanys' treaty onmonetary, economic and social union was seen by participantsas a complicating factor in the unification process that onceagain focused market attention on the costs of union. Thetreaty was signed last Friday.   SPD leader Hans-Jochen Vogel's statement that the partycan't accept the current treaty because it doesn't go farenough in creating good jobs for East Germans -- or provideprotection for East German businesses -- aroused worry that amore expensive package might have to be negotiated, leadingto greater inflationary pressure on the West German economy.   The SPD theoretically could block parliamentary passage ofthe treaty through its newly won majority in the upper houseof the West German parliament. However, the SPD decision wasseen in West Germany as merely signaling possible delays inthe unification, currently set for July 2. And Mr. Vogel'slanguage appeared to leave open the possibility that thetreaty could be approved as is, with additions to be workedout.   While participants didn't expect the SPD move to derailunification, the news brought out underlying nervousness inthe market about the exact impact of unification on the WestGerman economy.   &quot;The market's apprehensive on reunification because no oneseems to know the costs, and when there's some news out onthat front, there's a reaction,&quot; said Radhika Govindrajan, avice president at Manufacturers Hanover Trust in New York.   The mark's weakness yesterday was exacerbated bywidespread rumors in Europe that West German central bankPresident Karl Otto Poehl was resigning. The rumors laterwere strenuously denied by the Bundesbank, but the excuse tosell marks had been provided and the West German unit didn'tregain its losses, traders said.   Helping the dollar to its gains against the mark wasgrowing market confidence, based on events last week, thatU.S. authorities won't pull interest rates lower soon.Matched sales in the domestic money market last Thursday andFriday, when the Federal Funds rate stood below the Fed'starget of 8 1/4%, and a statement Friday by Richmond, Va.,Fed President Robert Black favoring higher interest rateshave convinced the market that the Fed isn't in a mood toease borrowing costs.   In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar was quotedat 1.6626 marks, up from 1.6477 marks late Friday, and at153.72 yen, up from 153 yen late Friday. Sterling was quotedat $1.6875, down from $1.6900 late Friday.   At midmorning Tuesday in Tokyo, the U.S. currency wastrading at 152.95 yen, down from Monday's Tokyo close of153.25 yen. Meanwhile, the dollar was trading at about 1.6665marks.   A rate cut by the Fed had been feared after recent U.S.economic indicators suggested a slowing economy and subsidinginflationary pressures.   In that context, the dollar strengthened nearlythree-quarters of a yen against its Japanese counterpart,helped by a belief that Japanese monetary authorities haven'treacted effectively to signs of rising inflation, said RickPorter, a vice president and manager of corporate trading atWestpac Corp. in New York.   An appropriate response to rising inflationary pressureswould be an increase in the Japanese discount rate, a courseof action the Bank of Japan has so far balked at taking, Mr.Porter said. The discount rate is the central bank's baserate on loans to commercial banks.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $373.30 an ounce, down $1.40. Estimatedvolume was a moderate 2.5 million ounces.   In Hong Kong Tuesday, gold was quoted at $372.75 an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
