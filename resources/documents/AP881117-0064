Tranquilizers like Valium, used to ease the ``crash'' of acocaine high by calming nerves and relieving paranoia, are becominga second drug of choice among cocaine users, according to a studyreleased Wednesday by the city's Haight Ashbury Free Clinic.   But cocaine users, particularly those who smoke the potent formknown as crack, take tranquilizers in such quantity that the effectsare reversed and users often become more agitated, unpredictable andviolent, said David Smith, the clinic's founder and medical director.   The ``dual-drug'' phenomenon parallels the ``speedballing''habits of heroin addicts 20 years ago, who supplemented theirbarbiturates with amphetamines, he said.   Valium and the tranquilizer Xanax, which overtook Valium lastyear as the most-prescribed benzodiazepine tranquilizer in thecountry, are long-acting drugs that can produce seizures when takenat high doses. They also can lead to severe addictions that are hardto kick, Smith said.   ``We believe we have identified a valid trend nationwide, andother independent sources support it,'' said Smith.   The study surveyed 3,000 workers in 339 chemical dependencytreatment programs across the nation on a variety of questions. Itfound that many reported a growing dual-drug problem.   Data on hospital emergency room drug overdoses, addictiontreatment admissions and law enforcement seizure statistics supportthe study results, Smith said. In San Francisco, emergency roomoverdoses have increased 77 percent this year compared to 1987.   ``The emergency room data suggest not only were we correct, butit's worse than we thought,'' said Smith. ``It's clearly a trend andwe've not peaked out yet.''   Smith said the widespread dual-drug phenomenon warrants expandedtreatment centers, supply-reduction efforts and education programsfor drug users and physicians.   Although cocaine users also use alcohol to take the edge off,Smith said researchers are particularly fearful of thecocaine-tranquilizer combination.   ``When you combine two drugs ... it multiplies. Instead of oneplus one equalling two, it's three, four, five or six,'' said HalLinebarger, a chemical dependency therapist at a center south of SanFrancisco. ``They cancel each other out, but it ends up being muchmore poisonous to the system.''   Tranquilizers can ease the emotional and physical depression thatfollows a cocaine ``high,'' Linebarger explained.   A secondary dependence on tranquilizers can go unnoticed by acocaine addict, Smith said. Physicians may prescribe tranquilizersfor patients who complain of feeling anxious and paranoid, notrealizing the symptoms are a result of cocaine use, he said.   Prescription tranquilizers also are available on the streetthrough wholesale diversions and international smuggling, he said.   Although the cocaine epidemic appeared to be leveling off in1983, the introduction of crack cocaine in 1984 produced recordlevels of dual-drug dependence, Smith said.   ``Any time you see an increase in an upper, you'll see anincrease in downers, and any time you see an increase in downers,you'll see an increase in uppers,'' he said. ``Smokable forms ofcocaine are really the fuel for this.''   The study was conducted by the Training and Education Section ofthe Haight Ashbury Free Clinic in conjunction with the ResearchDivision of the Merritt-Peralta Chemical Dependency RecoveryHospital in Oakland.</TEXT></DOC>
