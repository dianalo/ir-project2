More than 100,000Filipinos were made homeless by the typhoon.   As of 4 a.m. Wednesday (4 p.m. EDT Tuesday), the typhoon wascentered near latitude 16.3 north, longitude 117.5 east, in theSouth China Sea about 190 miles west of the Philippines coastal cityof Dagupan. The government weather service said Ruby's maximumsustained winds had decreased to 93 mph and that the typhoon wasmoving west-northwest at about 4 mph.   A coast guard cutter was dispatched early Wednesday to port ofCebu, 100 miles from where the Dona Marilyn went down, to search formissing passengers.   That would bring to three the number of major vessels searchingfor survivors of the Dona Marilyn, a 2,845-ton passenger liner thatreplaced the Dona Paz on the Sulpicio Lines run between Manila andTacloban.   The Dona Paz sank Dec. 20, 1987, after a collision off MindoroIsland with a tanker, and only 26 people were rescued. The officialdeath toll was 1,749, but some estimates said 3,000 died becausemany deck passengers making the holiday trip to Manila were not onthe manifest.   In suburban Manila, U.S. and Philippine helicopters rescuedhundreds of people stranded on rooftops and in trees by the floodingMarikina River.   Coast Guard officials said the Dona Marilyn sank Monday in theVisayas Sea about 300 miles southeast of Manila while it was makingthe Manila-Tacloban run.   It was carrying 451 passengers and 60 crew members from Manila toTacloban on Leyte Island when it radioed a distress call, saidCarlos Go, general manager of Sulpicio Lines.   Lt. Rey Esguerra of the coast guard station in Cebu said rescuershad found 11 survivors on Maripipi Island and another small island,and four people were found alive in the water.   Vicente Gambito, vice president of Sulpicio, put the numberrescued at 18. There was no explanation for the discrepancy.   The Dona Marilyn was authorized to carry about 1,400 passengersand crew.   Officials reported 25 people missing because of Typhoon Ruby atCagayan de Oro, a coastal city on Mindanao Island, and 15unaccounted for after a crowded bus plunged into a swollen riverMonday in Antique province. The Red Cross said 26 bodies wererecovered from the bus.   Floods on Luzon and other islands caused landslides and washedaway bridges.   Carlos Dominguez, the agriculture secretary, said preliminaryestimates put damage to crops at nearly $46 million, but casualtyand damage reports were incomplete because of poor communications.   Figures compiled from the Red Cross and government agenciesshowed 26 dead in Antique province, 20 in Occidental Mindoro, 15 inZamboanga del Sur, 11 in Cagayan de Oro, 11 in Manila's Marikinasuburb, six on Camiguin Island, four in Iloilo, three in NuevaEcija, two in Surigao City and one each in Pampanga and Bulacan.   Ruby's center passed about 50 miles east of Manila early Tuesdayand swept into the Tarlac, Bulacan and Nueva Ecija provinces, thearchipelago's main rice-growing region, the national weather servicereported.   Meteorologists said more than nine inches of rain fell in 24hours at the Manila airport. Domestic flights were canceled butinternational service continued.   President Corazon Aquino visited flooded Marikina, thehardest-hit district in the Manila area, on Tuesday and met withsome of the thousands who fled their homes.   Two American helicopters from Clark Air Base joined Filipinosoldiers and civilian volunteers in rescuing stranded people.   A Philippine navy landing craft and a hospital vessel capsized inheavy seas Monday at Zamboangak, but no casualties were reported. Atugboat owned by the state-run Philippine National Oil Company sankoff the Bataan Peninsula, also with no casualties.   Schools, government offices, the two stock exchanges and manyprivate businesses in Manila were closed Tuesday and the governmentsaid schools would not open Wednesday because of widespread floodingand power outages. Some schools were being used as evacuationcenters.   At least 110,000 of the nation's 56 million people were lefthomeless, officials reported. The government said 400,000 peoplewere ``affected,'' meaning their homes were damaged or destroyed.   Maj. Wayne Crist, a spokesman at Clark, 50 miles north of Manila,reported no major structural damage there, but said some aircraftwere evacuated to an undisclosed ``safe location.''   Typhoon Ruby was the 18th typhoon or tropical storm to strike thePhilippines this year and the strongest on Luzon since Patsy killedat least 175 people in 1970.</TEXT></DOC>
