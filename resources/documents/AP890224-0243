The central bank announced it was raising its discount rate, theinterest it charges on loans to member banks, ``in light ofinflationary pressures in the economy'' and after receiving requestsfrom 10 of its 12 district banks.   The action, taken on a 6-1 vote with Fed member Martha Segerdissenting, came just a day after Treasury Secretary Nicholas Bradyissued the strongest critical comments yet by the new administrationregarding the Fed's efforts to push interest rates higher in aneffort to combat inflation.   ``I don't see as strong evidence of inflation right now as doesthe Federal Reserve,'' Brady told the House Banking Committee.   Boosting the discount to the highest level in nearly three yearsis the most dramatic inflation-fighting move the Fed could havetaken. Discount rate increases often signal that other short-termloans, from adjustable-rate mortgages to automobile loans, will soonbecome more expensive.   Brady's comments followed several weeks of verbal joustingbetween the administration and the central bank. President Bush onseveral occasions has said that he believed the central bank wasoverly concerned about inflation and should be more worried thathigh interest rates could impede economic growth.   Another member of the administration, budget director Richard G.Darman, attempted today to get his colleagues to quiet theircriticisms. He said he believed it was ``extremely unhelpful just asa general matter to have an overt, visible disagreement'' between anadministration and the central bank.   He said such an open dispute ``tends to be unsettling to themarkets'' and generally harmful to prospects for economic growth.   Darman commented during a budget briefing for reporters that wasinterupted when an aide brought him a wire service story announcingthe discount rate increase.   The increase came one day after two major banks _ Chase ManhattanBank and Republic National Bank of New York _ raised their primelending rates to 11.5 percent from 11 percent.   Several other large banks raised their prime rates as well todayafter the Fed's announcement. Both the dollar and stock and bondmarkets moved lower in trading today.   Banks use the prime rate as a base for setting rates on a widevariety of business and consumer loans, including car loans andadjustable-rate home mortgages.   Economist David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. in New York saidthe Fed's action had been widely anticipated and there even was somespeculation the central bank might boost the rate a full percentagepoint rather than a half-point. He said further tightening could beexpected as the Fed tries to control escalating prices.   ``It was an appropriate action ... and does bring the Fed intorough alignment with the amount of restraint needed to stay evenwith the new inflation threat,'' Jones said. ``We are in the processof accelerating (inflation) and it will require further Fedtightening steps.''   The Fed last raised the discount rate on Aug. 9, to 6.5 percentfrom 6 percent. Today's increase was the third since Alan Greenspantook over chairmanship of the central bank in August 1987.   The discount rate last was at 7 percent from March 7, 1986, toApril 18, 1986, when it dropped to 6.5 percent. The rate bottomed at5.5 percent in August 1986 and since then has been on the rise.   The Fed's latest action follows two particularly worrisomeinflation reports for the month of January.   The Labor Department said its Producer Price Index jumped 1.0percent _ a 12.7 percent annual rate _ and the Consumer Price Indexsoared 0.6 percent, a 7.2 percent annual rate and the biggest jumpin two years.   By increasing interest rates, the Fed hopes to slow down economicactivity and thus ease inflationary pressures in the economy.   Fed member Seger, the sole dissenter to today's action, hasexpressed concern that higher interest rates could slow economicgrowth too much and hurt the ailing savings and loan industry.   Greenspan told the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday that anincrease of one percentage point in interest rates adds $3 billionto $4 billion to savings institutions' operating losses.   The Fed has been steadily nudging up interest rates since March1988 in an effort to check inflation by slowing economic growth. Thefederal funds rate, the interest that banks charge among themselvesfor overnight loans and is heavily influenced by Fed policy, hasrisen more than three percentage points over the last year, topping9.5 percent Thursday.   In congressional testimony Wednesday, Greenspan called the latestincrease in consumer prices ``disturbing'' and blamed it in part onrecent acceleration in wage increases.   He said price increases had reached unacceptable levels and couldincrease the chances for and severity of a recession if not broughtunder control.   ``If inflation re-emerges, I think a recession will move up on usmuch more quickly than we can imagine and when it occurs it will bea prolonged one,'' Greenspan said.   He maintained that the Fed's credit-tightening moves wouldprolong the 6-year-old economic expansion and moderate the nextdownturn.   While many analysts have been predicting that growth will slowthis year, early reports indicated the economy entered 1989 withstrong momentum.   Fed efforts to slow the economy to a more sustainable level ofgrowth could spell trouble for the Bush administration, which haspinned its deficit-reduction hopes on optimistic assumptions aboutthe economy's performance.   Today's discount rate hike was requested by the boards of theFed's regional banks in Boston, New York, Philadelphia, Richmond,Atlanta, Chicago, St. Louis, Minneapolis, Kansas City and SanFrancisco.</TEXT></DOC>
