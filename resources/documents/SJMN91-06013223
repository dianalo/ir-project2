Yet one of the oddities of ourcontemporary literature is that most of our writers shrink away from thisimportant and provocative subject. Americans prefer to face the reality ofdeath by denying it, by disguising it in euphemism and prettification;American writers, if we are to believe what they write, prefer to pretend itsimply doesn't exist.;    So quite apart from the merits of &quot;Patrimony,&quot; whichare considerable, Philip Roth deserves both praise and gratitude for meetingdeath head-on. This is a work of non-fiction by an author whose novels andstories have always walked a fine line between fiction and &quot;fact,&quot; indeed attimes have teetered so uneasily on that line as to raise serious questionsabout the territory they occupy. But in &quot;Patrimony,&quot; though it yieldsoccasional evidence of poetic license, Roth is on firm ground; his subject isthe death two years ago at the age of 86 of his father, Herman Roth, and hewrites about it with his eyes wide open, facing the facts unflinchingly andunsentimentally.;    Herman Roth never got so far as the nursing home or evena protracted hospital stay, but the brain tumor that finally killed himnonetheless exacted a dear toll in debilitation and loss of dignity. For hisson Philip, who was in his mid-50s as this process unfolded, being bothwitness to and participant in his father's dying was an almost unremittinglypainful experience. In &quot;Patrimony&quot; he gives us the full measure of that pain,but he also alleviates and ennobles it by giving us the joy as well.;    Thisis not to say that Herman Roth was a joyful man in the sense the term usuallyconjures up; he was cranky, stubborn, primitive, difficult. But he was also&quot;talkative, energetic, gregarious, very much the forceful insurance man whoseyears in Newark as an agent and assistant manager had familiarized him withnearly every Jewish family in the city.&quot; Above all else he was alive, and inhis son's portrait he emerges as one of the genuinely indomitable figures inAmerican literature.;    Herman Roth was also a kind man at heart, and hecared passionately about his family and his vast circle of friends, but hiswas a rough kindness that often left its recipients more bruised thanbettered. He was possessed by an irresistible urge to fix things up, to makethings right, and it never crossed his mind that he was more a nuisance and ascold than a help. An especially lovely moment comes late in Roth's tale when,having been told by his father that Lil, the woman with whom Herman shared anapartment after the death of his first wife, &quot;can't even buy a cantaloupe,&quot;the son at last has it up to here and explodes:;    &quot;Look, a cantaloupe is ahard thing to buy -- maybe the hardest thing there is to buy, when you stop tothink about it. A cantaloupe isn't an apple, you know, where you can tell fromthe outside what's going on inside. I'd rather buy a car than a  cantaloupe --I'd rather buy a house than a cantaloupe. . . . I'll tell you about making amistake with a cantaloupe: We all do it. We weren't made to buy cantaloupe. Dome a favor, Herm, get off the woman's ass, because it isn't just Lil'sweakness buying a . . . cantaloupe: It's a human weakness.&quot;;    That passageis one of several in which Roth simply cannot resist the urge to amuse. Othersinclude a geriatric musicale in Florida, a ride with a paranoid, parricidalcab driver in New York, and a dinner with a refugee from Nazi Germany whosememoir of the Holocaust turns out to be rank pornography.;    If these andother scenes are meant to lighten the way along Herman Roth's passage to thegrave, even more they are meant to conjure up the energy and spirit of hislife, to place him where he belongs -- as one in the community of Jewish menand women whose &quot;real work, the invisible, huge job that he did all his life,that that whole generation of Jews did, was making themselves American.&quot;;   That comment, true though it most certainly is, comes during one of only twosections of &quot;Patrimony&quot; that ring false: a long telephone conversation with afriend that clearly was therapeutic for Roth but is largely a roadblock forthe reader. The other is the book's conclusion, in which Roth resorts todreams in an attempt to give his story conclusive meaning; what he seems notto understand is that the story contains its own meaning, and that explication-- especially through the clumsy use of dreams -- merely muddies it.;    Thepoint that matters is made more than 50 pages earlier. &quot;He wasn't just anyfather,&quot; Roth writes, &quot;he was the father, with everything there is to hate ina father and everything there is to love.&quot; It is the old universal story, andno dreams or exegeses are needed to tell it; all we need are the facts, and inthe heart of his narrative Roth gives us these with clarity, understanding andlove.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  JONATHAN YARDLEY  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910113  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  20  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  952  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, January 13, 199100013223,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
