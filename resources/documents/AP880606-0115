Front-runner Michael Dukakis, meanwhile,moved closer to the nomination, gaining 37 former Albert Goresupporters in Kentucky.   Jackson and Dukakis were both in California today, wrapping upthe long Democratic presidential primary campaign with a final bidfor votes in the state that provides the biggest prize in Tuesday'sfour-state finale.   Vice President George Bush, who locked up his party's nominationsix weeks ago, was also campaigning today in California, with aseries of appearances aimed at calling attention to the drug issue.   Jackson, in Los Angeles, said that ``California can produce anupset tomorrow.'' However, in a four-state radio news conference, hefocused more on his goals for the convention next month in Atlanta.   He made clear that he will press for party adoption of hisposition that South Africa is a terrorist state and should bedeclared as such by the United States, making it subject to furthersanctions.   He said Dukakis' own unwillingness to make such a declaration sofar was ``too cautious.'' Jackson added, ``If he will not bend onthat matter, we'll simply meet each other on the floor in Atlanta.''   Dukakis, at a news conference today, said he had talked withJackson Sunday night by telephone and hoped to meet with him soon.   He didn't say what they would discuss. But when asked aboutJackson's campaign role, Dukakis said, ``If the tables were reversedand he was on his way to the nomination and I were the runner-up,I'd expect to be deeply involved. ... I'd try to bring my peopleinto this. I'd be as serviceable to the ticket as I possibly could.I'm confident he will be that kind of person.''   In Kentucky, meanwhile, Gov. Wallace Wilkinson endorsed Dukakistoday and said almost all of the Kentucky delegation to theconvention will follow his lead.   The switch will mean 37 delegates formerly committed to TennesseeSen. Gore have now jumped to the Dukakis camp. As it now stands, allbut six of Kentucky's 67 delegates to the convention will be behindDukakis. The others are pledged to Jackson.   Dukakis is likely to clinch his party's nomination in the finalround of contests Tuesday, which also includes races in New Jersey,Montana and New Mexico. He holds a huge delegate lead over Jackson,and is fewer than 300 delegates shy of the 2,081 needed to gain theDemocratic nomination.   The Massachusetts governor, who declared his candidacy 13 monthsago, got off to a shaky start when he finished third in theseason-opening Iowa caucuses in February. But in the months thatfollowed, he methodically felled a field of rivals, one by one.   Only Jackson remains an active competitor. And he is making itclear he will try to remain highly visible even after Tuesday'sraces.   Jackson says his camp will launch a massive voter-registrationdrive on Aug. 1. He has said he will keep making appearances afterTuesday. And he's putting the party on notice there are issues he'sready to fight for at the convention.   In addition, some of those around Jackson are taking anaggressive tack on the subject of the No. 2 spot on the Democraticticket. Dukakis has said Jackson deserves to be looked at as apossible running mate, but deserves no special consideration.   Jackson's campaign chairman, Willie Brown, said Sunday thatJackson ought to be offered a spot on the ticket.   ``I think consideration means literally extending the opportunityto go on the ticket, and then it will be up to Mr. Jackson todetermine whether or not he wishes to accept it,'' Brown said onABC-TV's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''   Jackson played down the Brown comment, saying: ``That's his pointof view.'' But he told a church congregation Sunday that theDemocratic Party ``must make a commitment to empowerment _ in theplatform, in the party, on the ticket.''   Telling the congregation in Los Angeles of his intention to pushhis agenda at the convention, Jackson used the word ``fight.'' Buthe softened that when he spoke to reporters afterward.   ``Fights come when you fail to negotiate ... when people havemade a decision to go in opposite directions,'' he said.   Dukakis, as he has been throughout the campaign, was careful toavoid criticizing Jackson.   As for Jackson's vow to push to make certain issues part of theparty platform, Dukakis said Sunday: ``I don't see any deepdivisions in the party at all.''   Dukakis' own aides have indicated he will get out and campaignprior to the convention to get an early start on the Novembercontest against Bush. But the vice president can't campaign muchuntil after the Republican convention, because he has already spentalmost the entire $27 million the law allows for a primary campaign.   Bush put some distance Sunday between himself and the White Houseon the environmentally sensitive issue of offshore oil drilling.   Campaigning in Los Angeles, the vice president called for a delayin a controversial drilling project off Northern California _ onethat the Interior Department has been pushing ahead.   ``Before going forward with new lease sales, we must be assuredthat the national treasure of the California coastline will not beharmed,'' the vice president said.   Dukakis jabbed at Bush on the subject today, saying, ``I'mpleased he's coming around, but it's kind of late. I'm not fordelaying that sale. I'm for canceling it.''</TEXT></DOC>
