The coal segment of the Dow Jones Equity Market Index isdown about 2% year-to-date in an up market. That makes thecoal industry the fourth-worst performer among 82 industrygroups in the Dow Jones Equity Market Index. Only preciousmetals, gas utilities and oil drilling stocks have doneworse. &quot;Coal is a Charles Dickens fuel -- it's 19th-centuryLondon,&quot; says one money manager who wouldn't dream of owninga coal stock.</LP><TEXT>   But all of that is precisely why some money managers andanalysts think coal stocks are a buy now. The group isunpopular, coal prices are low ($22 to $24 a ton for Easternlow-sulfur coal, compared with $27 a ton early last year),and the stocks are, for the most part, inexpensive. If thename of the game is to buy low, sell high, these out-of-favorstocks deserve at least a look.   What could make coal-company earnings rise? Chiefly, astronger economy, because coal is used mainly by utilities(it generates at least 55% of the electric power in the U.S.)and by heavy industry, particularly steel. Also, the U.S. mayship increasing amounts of low-sulfur coal to Europe.European coal mines, particularly in Germany and Britain, areold and expensive to operate.   &quot;We're at a low point in price for coal,&quot; declares MarkMadden, a Boston money manager for a unit of Pioneer Group,the mutual fund concern. He's partial to Westmoreland Coal,based in Philadelphia, which has low-sulfur deposits inAppalachia and good access to Eastern ports for export.   John Wallace, manager of the Oppenheimer Total ReturnFund, owns about 200,000 shares of Ashland Coal, the mostpopular stock in the group. Yesterday, Ashland traded at 293/8 on the New York Stock Exchange, which is 16 times thepast 12 months' earnings. That's below the 20 multiple on theStandard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index, but higher than themultiple on other coal stocks. Westmoreland Coal goes forabout 15 times earnings, Mapco for 13, Pittston for 12 andNerco for 11.   Ashland's advantages as Mr. Wallace sees them: low sulfur,good geographic location for exporting to Europe, goodlong-term contracts, and a wide choice of ways to ship itscoal by rail or water. (By contrast, some coal companies arenear-captives of a particular railroad, and must pay higherrates for transportation.)   &quot;You've got to admit Ashland's had a great move,&quot; Mr.Wallace says. The stock has climbed from around 16 in early1990 to 29 3/8. But he thinks there's room for more, becausehe expects the company to earn around $2.50 a share nextyear. The current price is less than a dozen times that.   &quot;I feel very positive&quot; on companies with &quot;high-quality&quot;coal, says Daniel Roling, an analyst with Merrill Lynch. Bythat, he means bituminous coal with high energy content, lowsulfur and low ash. He would buy Ashland, Pittston, andWestmoreland. He would avoid Nerco, Mapco, and AddingtonResources.   &quot;The growth of our exports will be very strong&quot; over thecoming decade, Mr. Roling believes. &quot;I'm looking forsteam-coal exports to double in the 1990s.&quot; And that's lessoptimistic than the U.S. Energy Department, which looks forsteam-coal exports to more than quadruple.   &quot;Europe is closing its industry and importing more,&quot; saysMr. Roling. &quot;Many of its mines are uneconomic. They've beenmining them for a lot longer than we've been mining ours.They have high labor costs&quot; and need to go down so deep tofind more coal that drilling becomes very expensive. Evenwhen the coal is found, it's often high in sulfur, &quot;poorer inquality than what they import from us.&quot;   Rafael A. Villagran, coal analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers, has downgraded Ashland to a weak buy from a strongone, based on the stock's price runup. His favorite isPittston, based in Greenwich, Conn., which owns BurlingtonAir Express and Brink's (armored car service, courier serviceand home security) in addition to coal-mining operations. Thestock has been weak, mostly because Pittston's coalproduction lately has been lower in quality and quantity thanexpected. But Pittston has attractive low-sulfur reserves,and Mr. Villagran believes the mining problems will becleared up by next year.   Scott Black, president of Delphi Management in Boston,puts in a good word for Nerco, based in Portland, Ore.&quot;They've got good coal contracts tied up&quot; for years, he says,with &quot;CPI escalators built in,&quot; meaning that the price Nercoreceives for its coal will rise with the consumer priceindex.   While &quot;coal is the real cash cow&quot; in Nerco's business, Mr.Black also likes its oil and gas properties, which he valuesat $668 million. Throw in coal and a little gold mining,subtract Nerco's $806 million in debt, and Mr. Black reckonsthe company is worth 27 a share. Yesterday, Nerco sharesclosed at 19 3/4, down 1/8, on the Big Board.   Not everyone likes the coal companies, of course. &quot;It'snot a fuel of choice,&quot; says one New York money manager.&quot;There's plenty of oil around, and plenty of natural gas.&quot;For coal prices to rise, he says, &quot;first you've got to getoil in trouble, or up {in price}, then the natural-gasbusiness, and then coal will come around.&quot;   &quot;Hey, it's a bad year,&quot; says Joel Price, analyst withDonaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette. &quot;We went into the year withexcessive stockpiles at utilities {and} metallurgical coal issloppy because of the economy. . . . Prices are justterrible.&quot; He concedes that exports will be strong, but notesthat much of the coal will still be used domestically. (Someanalysts expect the percentage of exports to rise to 15% from10% during the next several years.)   Mr. Price does recommend three of the nine coal companieshe follows. But in two of the three cases, it's thecompanies' noncoal operations that attract him -- forkliftsfor Nacco Industries, oil refining for Mapco. He also favorsAshland, whose Mingo Logan mine in West Virginia has beenricher than anyone expected. He recently raised his per-shareearnings estimate for Ashland to $2.30 this year, $2.60 in1992 and $3 in 1993.   If coal stocks do, in fact, turn out to be good buys,individual investors, not institutions, are likely to benefitmost. The stocks have a small float -- the number of sharesfree to trade -- making it cumbersome to swap thousands ofshares, as institutions are wont to do. Publicly traded coalcompanies actually mine only about 10% of the nation's coal.Oil companies such as Exxon have big coal operations, and sodo such other companies as Du Pont, Hanson, Amax and Fluor.</TEXT></DOC>
