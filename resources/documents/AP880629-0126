Tribune on drug hysteria:   Worried Americans tell pollsters that drugs are the nation's No.1 problem. Congress is about to boost spending in the ``war ondrugs'' to $9.1 billion a year. George Bush, Michael Dukakis andJesse Jackson battle over drug issues. Politicians point fingers ateach other for not voting to impose the death penalty on drugdealers who commit murder.   At the risk of being branded soft on drugs and ridden out oftown on a rail, may we suggest that the ``drug crisis'' is beingblown out of proportion and that while it is serious, the countryhas more important concerns?   Rep. Fortney Stark, D-Calif., deserves credit for trying to putthe drug threat in perspective by circulating three revealingnumbers among his colleagues: Last year illegal narcotics usekilled fewer than 6,000 Americans, while cigarettes caused morethan 300,000 deaths and alcohol 60,000.   Of course, the damage done by drugs greatly exceeds 6,000deaths. Illicit narcotics are a cause of crime, grief, wasted livesand AIDS transmission. The problem is grave, but not overwhelming.Drugs should be addressed with more balance, less politicalposturing and no hysteria.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 27   The Tulsa (Okla.) Tribune on the U.S. space station:   Politicians seldom take steps that lack immediate results _ andsubsequent benefit at the ballot box.   Thus it was cheering to see the Senate appropriations defensesubcommittee vote $800 million last week toward the planned U.S.space station, even if NASA says that is $100 million less thannecessary to make it operational by a 1996 target. The figure isfar better than the $200 million approved by another subcommitteelast week, an amount space officials said was so insufficient itwould derail the project.   A space station manned by scientists is the key to solvinguniversal questions _ and ones of survival on Earth. It is not afrill or a luxury.   Even those in Congress with focus no further than the nextelection apparently realize that.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 27   Salem (Ore.) Statesman-Journal on the Pentagon scandal:   Who was minding the store?   The widening investigation of fraud and bribery in the nation'sweapons procurement system is sickening, but it is not surprising.That's what happens when a climate of permissiveness, starting atthe very top, pervades a bureaucratic system. ...   The lackadaisical disregard for the ethical conduct displayed byscores of important appointees in the Reagan administration has setthe tone for those in lesser positions. It's no wonder that theprocurement system became riddled with bribery and fraud.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 27   St. Louis Post-Dispatch, on the Pentagon scandal:   The ongoing federal investigation of Pentagon corruption focuseson the selling of sensitive inside information. But the problem ofcorrupt Pentagon procurement goes beyond bribery.   In many ways, the entire system has become corrupt. ... As ithas taken years for the mess in Pentagon procurement to develop, soit will take years to repair the damage.   To begin that process, whoever wins the election in Novembermust make a top-to-bottom reform of Pentagon planning and militaryprocurement an urgent priority.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 27   The Honolulu Star-Bulletin on the possible Marcos return to thePhilippines:   Philippine President Aquino would be risking a lot by lettingFerdinand Marcos return home, even to stand trial as a defendant inthe theft of national wealth.   Marcos, who has been living in Honolulu since February 1986, haspreviously asked for permission to go home. He wanted to be withhis dying mother and also to attend her funeral. These requestswere wisely rejected by the Aquino government, which has enoughtroubles without letting the deposed president back into thecountry.   Aquino's fragile government is asking for trouble by letting themischievous Marcos back in the country, even if he is under lockand key. Opportunities are still ripe for Marcos and his oldbackers to exploit his presence in Manila to stir up insurrection.   As badly as the Philippines wants Marcos' millions, the price ofhaving Marcos back home again may be too costly a trade-off.</TEXT><TEXT>   June 27   The Tacoma (Wash.) News Tribune on the Greenhouse Effect:   Look closely at the news photos coming out of drought-strickenfarm regions, at images of sun-baked land and withered crops. If agroup of scientists who testified before a congressional hearinglast week are right, pictures like that could be common in years tocome _ and we have only ourselves to blame.   The cars that clog our freeways, the factories and power plantsthat spew pollutants into the air, the massive deforestation takingplace in poor countries _ they all contribute to the ``greenhouseeffect,'' a warming trend expected to profoundly impact our planet.The four warmest years of the last 100 have been in the 1980s, and1988 is shaping up to be the hottest on record.   What could be the long-range consequences? As with just aboutanything, there will be winners and losers. America's rich FarmBelt could dry up, but Canadian and Soviet agriculture wouldbenefit.   Because some countries stand to benefit from a global warmingtrend, it could be difficult to enlist their support for measuresto fight it. ...   So what can be done? A start would be to clean house in ourcountry by phasing out polluting plants, improvingmass-transportation systems and developing pollution-freealternative energy sources.   America, after all, is one of the major contributors to theproblem. If this country doesn't show leadership, who will?</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
