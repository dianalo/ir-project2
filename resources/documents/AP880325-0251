The announcement by the Du Pont Co. could encourage othercompanies to follow suit, says Sherwood Rowland, professor ofatmospheric chemistry at the University of California at Irvine.   ``I think Du Pont has had more intimate contact with the sciencethan some of the other companies,'' and thus more credibility,Rowland said Thursday. ``I am elated by it.''   Rowland's delight was matched by environmentalists and theirallies in Congress, who used words they rarely use when talkingabout large corporations _ things like ``This letter is a wonderfulsurprise,'' as Sen. David Durenberger, R-Minn., put it.   ``This is a sterling example of corporate environmentalleadership'' added Dan Dudek, an economist with the EnvironmentalDefense Fund.   Du Pont's pledge notably omitted any deadline for compliance.Joe Steed, environmental manager in Du Pont's Freon Productsdivision, said the length of a changeover to other chemicals couldnot yet be determined. He said it will depend on the outcome ofwork still under way testing substitutes, but it should be known``certainly within five years.''   It was Rowland who, in 1974 with Mario Molina, first mapped thechemical route _ then just a theory _ by which the long-livedchlorofluorocarbon or CFC compounds rise high into thestratosphere, are broken up by ultraviolet rays and liberatechlorine which destroys the ozone that normally blocks ultravioletrays from reaching the ground.   That ultraviolet causes skin cancer, and there is some evidencefrom lab animal tests that it can suppress the immune system. TheEnvironmental Protection Agency has estimated that each 1 percentdecline in ozone overhead means an increase of 4.8 percent to 7.5percent in the most common forms of skin cancer. Research is underway to determine the effect, if any, of increased ultraviolet ontiny forms of marine life. Some have predicted that they, too,could be hurt by increased ultraviolet.   The Rowland-Molina mechanism, scientists say, is almostcertainly what causes the annual 50 percent drop in ozone over theAntarctic continent each spring, and what has caused a 2.3 percentdecline in ozone over mid-latitudes from 1969 to 1986.   The mid-latitude decline was announced last week by a panel ofmore than 100 scientists who worked under the National Aeronauticsand Space Administration for 17 months in the most thoroughexamination ever undertaken of ozone.   This report was ``important new information,'' Du Pont'schairman, Richard E. Heckert, wrote members of the SenateEnvironment and Public Works Committee.   Thus, ``additional actions should be taken for long-termprotection of the ozone layer,'' a switch from Heckert's March 4letter to the senators saying further action was not needed.   Thirty-one nations last fall signed a treaty in Montreal callingfor a 50 percent reduction in CFC production by 1998. Heckert'sletter said Du Pont was encouraging other manufacturers and CFCusers to join in ``an orderly transition to the total phaseout'' ofthe compounds.   ``We also plan to urge all nations to treat the new scientificinformation seriously, accelerate ratification of the MontrealProtocol and then immediately initiate the protocol's assessmentprocess to consider further global limitations on the emission ofCFCs,'' he wrote.   CFCs have been valued because they are non-toxic andnon-flammable.   DuPont and other companies have rushed work on substitutes inrecent years, and the company already has announced alternativeproducts for plastic foam blowing agents and cleaning solvents forelectronics parts. DuPont and others are researching new compoundsfor a third major use of CFCs, as refrigeration fluids. The fourthmajor use, as aerosol propellants, was banned in the United Statesin 1978, though it is still common abroad.   U.S. aerosols now are powered by hydrocarbon compounds whichslightly enhance the production of ozone at ground level, where itis a pollutant.   A Du Pont briefing paper said some jobs might be impossible toperform with substitutes at a price anyone would pay, but it didnot give specifics.   More than 2,000 workers in Du Pont plants in seven countriesmake about 25 percent of some 2.3 billion pounds of CFC compoundsconsumed each year. The company said it sells $600 million worth ofCFC products annually, about 2 percent of its sales revenue.   Steed said the company hopes that ``over the long term'' jobsmaking replacement compounds would offset lost CFC jobs.</TEXT></DOC>
