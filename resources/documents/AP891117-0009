Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher said Thursday the Soviettravel legislation will not lead to an immediate dismantling oftariffs erected by Congress 15 years ago in behalf of Soviet Jews.   He said the Soviets, at best, would get only a year-to-yearwaiver while restrictions on trade credits would remain in place.   ``We'll review it to see if it is sufficient,'' Mosbacher saidof the Soviet legislation that is expected to clear its finalhurdle by December. ``We can't prejudge that.''   He did not spell out the U.S. conditions at a joint newsconference with Konstantin F. Katushev, the Soviet minister offoreign economic affairs. But he said the process could take ``alot longer'' than his initial guess of one to three months.   Besides, Mosbacher said, a new trade agreement with the SovietUnion would have to be negotiated first. The last accord wasnullified by Moscow in 1975 in retaliation for the erection oftariff barriers to Soviet goods a year earlier.   Mosbacher and Katushev signed commercial agreements designed toboost U.S. investment in the Soviet Union and to launchnegotiations on a new tax treaty. Also, they set up a working groupto consider a new trade agreement ``on a preliminary basis,''Mosbacher said.   But, he added: ``We want to make clear that we are not beginningnegotiation of a trade agreement. This can come only after theSoviets codify their emigration legislation and after a waiverunder the Jackson-Vanik amendment becomes possible.''   The legislation imposed tariffs against Soviet goods that arenot applied to the exports of most other countries. The restrictionon trade credits, known as the Stevenson amendment, was adopted ina parallel move by Congress.   Rep. Charles E. Schumer, D-N.Y., who has pushed for wider Jewishemigration, said in a statement: ``The Soviet Union is making realprogress. But going all the way toward granting most-favored nation(MFN) status strikes me as premature.   ``There are several issues that need to be cleaned up. There are600 long-term `refuseniks' who should be freed before we extend thecarrot of MFN.''   The National Conferece on Soviet Jewry said, meanwhile, in astatement: ``We welcome the initiative by the Soviet government inbringing before the Supreme Soviet a draft law providing forfreedom of entry and exit.''   The conference lists 51,336 Jews as emigrating from the SovietUnion by the end of October. The exodus surpasses the all-time highof 51,320 reached in 1979.   Anticipating U.S. action to facilitate trade, Soviet AmbassadorYuri V. Dubinin told reporters at the Soviet embassy: ``We areexpecting some positive steps from the U.S. side.'' He called theSoviet legislation a breakthrough and evidence of ``new thinking.''   The legislation establishes the right of all Soviet citizens totravel abroad _ permanently or on visits _ and reduces oreliminates most restrictions in effect now.   ``The Soviet Union measures its words with deeds,'' Dubinin saidas he detailed some of the major provisions, and Moscow'sexpectation of a positive U.S. response.   Dubinin linked the legislation, which is bound to accelerate analready quickening pace of Jewish, ethnic German, Armenian andPentecostal emigration, to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's effortto restructure the Soviet economy.   Two-way trade now amounts to about $3 billion. American grainsales to the Soviet Union account for about $2 billion.   By contrast, Soviet trade with West Germany is nearly $7.6billion a year and with Finland, a much smaller country, $6 billionannually.   Katushev said American businesses were eager to invest in theSoviet Union and were seeking ``a favorable approach'' from theBush administration.   ``We have no prejudices at all to selling to America,'' he saidthrough a Russian translator. ``We would like to see American womenin Soviet furs.''</TEXT></DOC>
