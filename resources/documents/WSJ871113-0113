Quite a few decisions written by the 51-year-old federal appeals court judge in his 12 years on the bench have been reviewed by the court, many of them reflecting his conservative approach to antitrust and other legal issues affecting business.    Yesterday, as the nominee to the high court began making courtesy calls to some senators, Senate leaders met with President Reagan to discuss whether the hearings will begin next month or in January, but they reached no agreement. Joseph Biden (D., Del.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, and Strom Thurmond (R., S.C.), senior committee Republican, said after seeing the president that they would discuss starting dates with their colleagues and make a decision next week.    &quot;I know of no one who wants to move this thing slowly,&quot; Sen. Biden said. He said he has &quot;heard nothing particularly negative about Judge Kennedy at all. Thus far his prospects seem very good . . . .&quot;    Sen. Jesse Helms (R., N.C.), who led conservative opposition to Judge Kennedy two weeks ago when President Reagan chose Judge Douglas Ginsburg, yesterday reversed course. After meeting with Judge Kennedy and the president, Mr. Helms told reporters, &quot;I think he'll make a fine member of the Supreme Court.&quot;    Sen. Thurmond said he also expects support for the nominee from other conservatives, some of whom earlier had described him as too moderate. &quot;You're not going to get anybody who's going to please everybody,&quot; he said.    Unlike President Reagan's first two choices for the job, Judges Ginsburg and Robert Bork, Judge Kennedy isn't a doctrinaire follower of the school of legal thought known as &quot;law and economics,&quot; which measures legal questions for their cost-effectiveness and impact on a free market.    In the antitrust field, Judge Kennedy's opinions, like those of retired Justice Lewis Powell whom he would replace, portray a conservative who doesn't believe in applying antitrust laws too stringently or to business situations for which he believes they weren't intended.    In 1980, Judge Kennedy argued against applying the toughest antitrust standards to the practice of setting maximum prices used by medical groups in Phoenix and Tucson, Ariz. State officials argued that the practice led doctors to charge the maximum, making the practice illegal price-fixing by its very nature. Rejecting this view, Judge Kennedy said too little was known about &quot;the impact on competition&quot; to declare the practice automatically illegal.    The Supreme Court in 1982 disagreed and said the Arizona doctors' practice was illegal. But the high court opinion by Justice John Stevens has been widely criticized by antitrust lawyers as failing to really evaluate the impact on competition. Justice Powell dissented, taking a view similar to Judge Kennedy's.    In 1982, the appeals court permitted an employee to sue his company on grounds of antitrust violations, when the firm fired him after he refused to carry out an alleged bid-rigging and price-fixing scheme. In dissent, Judge Kennedy said the employee might be able to sue under state employment laws, but he objected to &quot;heavy-handed interference from the federal courts in the name of enforcing laws designed only for protecting the nation's competitive economic system.&quot;    When the Supreme Court ruled on a similar issue the next year, a majority, including Justice Powell, took Judge Kennedy's view.    In still another case, Judge Kennedy wrote in a 1981 dissent that antitrust laws don't bar banks from having directors who also serve on the boards of insurance companies with whom the banks compete, for example in mortgages and real estate loans. In 1983, the Supreme Court agreed with Judge Kennedy's dissent.    Joe Sims, a Washington antitrust lawyer, said, &quot;The decisions make it seem that Judge Kennedy will be generally conservative, which puts him in what is becoming the mainstream in antitrust.&quot;    Outside the antitrust field, Judge Kennedy was overruled in an opinion by Justice Powell in 1979. Judge Kennedy had ruled in 1976 that federal law doesn't permit housing discrimination lawsuits by &quot;testers,&quot; persons who aren't actually buyers but who pose as home seekers to investigate racial bias. But the high court ruled that testers may challenge race bias under a 1968 fair housing law.    In a 1984 decision, the high court upheld Judge Kennedy's view, written in 1983, that the Securities and Exchange Commission doesn't have to notify persons who may be targets of investigations when it subpoenas other witnesses to gather evidence. </TEXT></DOC>
