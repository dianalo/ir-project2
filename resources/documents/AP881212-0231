Today the government estimates thenumber at less than one in 20. While many Bedouins still refuse toabandon their culture, the lure of modern conveniences andgovernment services is putting the brakes on a society that has beenon the move for thousands of years.</TEXT><BYLINE>By JOHN RICE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>AL FEIDA, Jordan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A way of life 6,000 years old is fadingaway in the Arabian desert as nomadic Bedouin tribesmen settle down.Today's ``ships of the desert'' are trucks, not camels.   ``It is dying, and it's a shame,'' says Sheik Mohammed Tradal-Shaalan, leaning against a pillow in a woven tent open to asprawling vista of the barren Jordanian desert.   Shaalan is a leader of the Rwallah tribe, which has roamed forhundreds of years across land now divided by the borders of Syria,Iraq, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.   Of some 200,000 Rwallah clansmen, ``I would say less than 5percent are still moving, even less than that,'' the sheik says.   Shaalan says perhaps a third of them are partly nomadic, thewomen or children living in town while the husband lives in a tentand follows the herds of goats and sheep.   As Shaalan speaks, about 100 camels slowly glide by in thedistance, led by a Rwallah tribesman. Shalaan's own four-wheel drivevehicle with custom wheel rims is parked beside the tent, not farfrom the perch of two tethered hunting falcons.   The camel has become more a status symbol than a necessity. Todaytrucks kick up plumes of dust over the hard-floored Jordanian desertmiles from any roads. They carry water, livestock and tents from onesite to another, making it easier for Bedouins to reach their herdsfrom fixed campsites or villages, many of which have sprung uparound wells and schools provided by governments throughout theregion.   Greater mobility and government services have encouraged theBedouins to settle _ as have a long drought and the problems ofcrossing borders.   ``As people are able to travel farther, they don't have to moveas much in terms of their residences,'' says Don Henry, a Universityof Tulsa paleontologist who has lived among modern-day Bedouins inJordan while studying their ancestors.   ``Women always like to get away from the hardship of living in atent and moving every day or every week and having to collectbranches for cooking fires,'' Shaalan says. ``They prefer to beliving in a house with electricity and gas ovens and to have breadcoming from the bakery.''   Um Khader, a Bedouin woman in the hills south of Amman agrees.``Oh lord, how I love the cement house,'' she says. ``I'm rid of thedust.''   About two in five Jordanians were nomadic Bedouins in the 1920sand 1930s. Today, the government estimates that less than one in 20still follows the old way of life.   ``I think what you're seeing is the last of the Mohicans,'' saysKamel Abu Jaber, a University of Jordan political scientist who leda survey of Bedouins in the late 1970s.   ``It never crossed my mind to leave the tent and live in ahouse,'' says Sheik Ahmad Hamadi al-Guesam. ``I like the freedom. Ilike the peace. I want to die in this black tent.''   But like many Bedouins, al-Guesam says he keeps his children in anearby town, where they can go to school. Two have already graduatedand joined the army, a favored occupation for a martial people whoonce treated raiding as a sort of sport.   Inside his black goat-hair tent, the sheik offers visitors thecardamon-spiced Bedouin coffee and repeated cups of sugary tea frompots kept steaming on the fragrant bed of coals before him.   A pet cat stalks out from behind a bamboo screen that sets offthe women's quarters within. The sound of small children gigglingand chatting drifts through the reeds.   Shaalan, in addition to his tent, has a house in remote Al-Feidaand sends his children to school in Amman, where he says they arecloser to health care and other services.   Shaalan himself studied management at Biscayne College in Miami,a Catholic school since renamed St. Thomas University.   Henry says nomadic herders broke away into the desert from smallfarming settlements in Jordan some 6,000 years ago, although it isunclear if those ancient people were the same as today's Bedouins.   Even so, he says, ``It's just uncanny the number of parallels yousee between 6,000-year-old camps and the ones you see occupiedtoday.''   Camels arrived perhaps 2,000 to 1,500 B.C., making it possiblefor the nomads to range farther into the arid expanses of Arabia.   Scholars say the Bedouins have developed a complex andsophisticated culture while living beyond the reach of governments.Their complicated system of unwritten laws, based on intensely felthonor and hospitality, operates even today alongside formal laws.   Crimes such as murder or rape once could lead to bloodshed andstill often today require restitution to the victim _ an elementoften missing in Western law.   Shaalan says the offenders also might be banished from the tribe,a stiff penalty in a society where identity is based on the clan.   For lesser crimes, a man ``would be disgraced, not be presentedwith a cup of coffee in a group like this...His sister would not bemarried to a dignified person,'' Shaalan says.   But the sheik says the old ways are eroding as Bedouins settle.   ``Living in a city has made people lose a great deal of theirdignity, generosity, truth in dealings...They have acquired the badhabits of the city,'' Shaalan complains.   In the city, ``people are becoming very busy, so generosity islost...You can't just come to a tent and enter and whoever is thereserves you food and coffee.''   Shaalan compares Bedouin virtues to those of rural Americans.   ``I really felt as if I was in a Bedouin society when I was inOregon in the country, when I was in Tennessee close to the SmokeyMountains,'' he says. ``When I went to the big cities, I felt like Iwas in a jungle.''   Bedouin values, even weakened, continue to permeate Arab society.Hospitality is prized. Families are tight, and behavior is bound bycodes of honor. Consensus is preferred to majority rule.   ``I'm fairly convinced that being Bedouin is not a way of life atall. Its a political ideology,'' says William Lancaster, a Britishanthropologist who spent several years living with the Rwallah.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Dec. 25</NOTE></DOC>
