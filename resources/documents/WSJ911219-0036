Martha Wittbrodt, editor, said individual investorsaccounted for $2.5 billion of the outflow.   The average seven-day simple yield on taxable funds easedto 4.59% from 4.63%, Donoghue's said. The average 30-daysimple yield dropped to 4.66% from 4.70%, while the average30-day compound yield slid to 4.77% from 4.81%.   Average maturity of the funds' investments -- whichinclude commercial paper (short-term corporate IOUs), bankcertificates of deposit and Treasury bills -- shortened byone day to 61 days. That's still quite long by money-fundstandards, a sign that portfolio managers don't expect anupturn in interest rates soon.   Yields on tax-free funds rose slightly, in response to anincreased supply of short-term municipal securities at theend of the year. The average seven-day compound yield rose to3.79% from 3.75%, according to Donoghue's.   The latest yield is equivalent to a taxable 5.26% for aninvestor in the 28% tax bracket and to 5.49% for someonepaying 31% in taxes.
