Theeconomy will improve as the year progresses,&quot; predicts DonaldStraszheim, chief economist at Merrill Lynch andamp; Co.</LP><TEXT>   But for many Americans, this won't be a happy New Year.Economists predict 1992 growth will be sluggish and wellbelow the typical economic recovery. Some regions, such asthe Northeast, will revive much more slowly than the nationaleconomy. And the unemployment rate will be about the samelate this year as it is now.   Most interest rates will drop slightly over the next fewmonths, many economists say. Lower rates will encourage moreAmericans to refinance their mortgages, trimming theirmonthly payments. The national average on 30-year fixed-ratemortgages already has tumbled to 8.43% from 9.76% a year ago,says Paul Havemann, vice president of HSH Associates, aButler, N.J., publisher of mortgage information. Somemortgage specialists expect fixed-rate mortgages to drop to8.25% or possibly even 8% soon, which should stimulate homebuying.   Later this year, interest rates will edge higher,according to the consensus view. Inflation will remainmoderate at about 3% all year. In the foreign-exchangemarkets, the dollar, which has fallen sharply in recentmonths, will rise slightly against the Japanese yen.   As unemployment mounts this winter, more lawmakers willworry about losing their own jobs next November. The result,according to 37 of the 42 analysts, will be a tax cut. Somepredict Congress will allow savers to cash in part of theirindividual retirement accounts and other savings plans,without penalty, for such items as first-time home purchases,medical emergencies and education.   A slow-growth scenario will be great news for investors,according to Edward Yardeni of C.J. Lawrence Inc. He saysinflation will remain moderate and interest rates willtumble, a combination that is &quot;very bullish for stocks.&quot;   Although it's frequently smart to bet against theconsensus forecast, many investors are betting heavily on itthis time around.   Stock prices burst into record territory earlier thisweek. Bond prices also have soared. Treasury bond yields havedived below 7.5% to their lowest levels in nearly five years,and three-month Treasury bills now yield less than 4%.   But before gambling heavily on this outcome, remember thatno one in this survey six months ago even came close to beingright on how far down the Federal Reserve would driveshort-term interest rates in 1991. Remember also that inmid-1990, 35 of the 40 economists surveyed predicted that theeconomy would continue expanding for at least another 12months. Shortly thereafter, the recession began.   There are other reasons to be especially skeptical thistime of the consensus view on the outlook for economicrecovery.   How can the economy lift off under the massive weight ofhuge public and private debt burdens? Where are consumersgoing to find extra spending money when they will have to digdeeper into their pockets to pay higher state and localtaxes? Why is it reasonable to expect more consumer spendingat a time when surveys show widespread pessimism and growingfear of unemployment? How can lower interest rates do muchgood as long as banks are leery about lending?   Among those who won't swallow what passes for conventionalwisdom is William A. Brown, chief economist at J.P. Morgan andamp;Co., parent of Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. He predicts a&quot;sharp&quot; contraction in the economy in this year's first half.   An even bigger decline is expected by A. Gary Shilling,who heads his own consulting firm in Springfield, N.J. Hepredicts the civilian unemployment rate will soar to 9% byMay and 10% by November. (That chilling 10% forecast is thesame prediction Mr. Shilling made one year ago for November1991. The actual November figure was 6.8%.)   For Christmas, Mr. Shilling sent clients and friends &quot;TheExcess Card,&quot; a wooden &quot;credit card&quot; with the slogan &quot;Helpingyou maintain a lifestyle you can't afford.&quot; The name on thecard: I.M. BROKE.   Philip Braverman of DKB Securities Corp. predicts theeconomy will remain mired in recession at least throughspring -- and quite possibly throughout the entire year. &quot;Thestability of the financial system could literally be at riskamid widespread financial distress and soaring bankruptciesamong thrifts, banks, insurance companies, other financialinstitutions, LBOs {leveraged buy-outs}, real estate firmsand other businesses in manufacturing and services,&quot; hecontends.   Some non-economists as well aren't impressed by theconsensus forecast. &quot;It's not that the borrowers aren'twilling to borrow but that banks are not willing to lend,&quot;says Max Freund, a New York City lawyer. &quot;I'm no economist,but it seems to me the repeated reductions in interest rateshave not resulted in increased lending so far. So what makesall these economists think this will change?&quot;   Equally dubious is Raul Gonzalez, a 32-year-old New YorkCity doorman. &quot;I don't believe these economists. My gut tellsme we're headed for more trouble,&quot; he says. Mr. Gonzalezcheerfully acknowledges his forecasts are wild guesses. Butremember: When Mr. Gonzalez was included among a group ofnon-economists surveyed by the Journal at the end of 1989,his bond-yield forecast for the following six months came alot closer to the mark than most of the pros. He didn't dobadly on bonds last year, either, predicting that Treasurybonds would yield 7.90% by the end of 1991. That was off byonly about half a percentage point -- a better performancethan about half the professional forecasters surveyed.   Cheer up, most economists retort. In reply to Mr. Freund'squestion, they say federal regulators already are urgingbankers to be less Scrooge-like, and that this will lead toincreased lending soon. &quot;As rates come down, more people willqualify for loans and more projects will look profitable tobusinesses and to the banks,&quot; says Mr. Straszheim of Merrill.   Chicken Little investors keeping their savings mostly incash will miss big opportunities in the financial marketsthis year, several analysts predict. History shows that it'sdangerous to bet against stocks in a presidential electionyear. &quot;Cash investing is an oxymoron,&quot; says Robert Barbera ofLehman Brothers.   Adds Mr. Straszheim: &quot;Always at this time of the businesscycle, people say lower interest rates won't help. Andthey're always wrong.&quot;   Here are average forecasts and other predictions culledfrom this newspaper's year-end survey of 42 economists:   -- The economy will expand at only a 1.1% annual rate inthis year's first half and a 3% clip in the last six months,after inflation. These estimates are based on gross domesticproduct.   -- Housing, after a poor 1991, will be among the country'sstrongest areas this year, thanks to lower interest rates.Housing-related industries such as appliances, furniture andlumber will benefit. Auto sales will perk up. U.S. exportswill improve because the dollar's drop in theforeign-exchange markets in the second half of last year ismaking U.S. exports more competitive in world markets. Someanalysts, though, worry that exports won't boom this yearbecause so many of America's major trading partners areenduring tough times, too.   -- Commercial real estate will remain in the doldrums,with more and more office towers turning into see-throughbuildings. The industry will suffer &quot;for at least the nextfew years,&quot; says Mr. Barbera of Lehman Brothers.   -- Long-term borrowing costs will decline very slightly incoming months, helped by growing optimism that inflation willremain under control. Also, Treasury officials have said theyare thinking about cutting the amount of new 30-year bondsthey issue this year. The yield on 30-year Treasury bonds,which has fallen to 7.39% from 8.41% in mid-1991, will be7.30% on June 30. At the end of 1992, they will yield 7.49%.   -- Short-term interest rates will also be lower nextsummer. The yield on three-month Treasury bills will be 3.80%at midyear, compared with 3.93% Tuesday. By year end, therate will be 4.25%.   -- The civilian unemployment rate will rise to 7% nextMay, then drift back down to 6.8% in November, exactly thesame as November 1991.   -- Opinion is sharply divided on whether the nation isstill in a recession. Many agreed, though, that whatever it'scalled, the economy is hardly moving at all. Robert Dederickof Northern Trust Co. in Chicago describes the economy as&quot;suspended between stagnation and slippage.&quot;   -- Analysts are sharply divided on how big this year's taxcut will be, and what taxes will be cut. Several predictedCongress would cut rates for low- and middle-incometaxpayers, reduce the capital-gains rate, and raise the rateon the wealthiest. Some, such as Dewey Daane of VanderbiltUniversity, strongly favor an investment tax credit tostimulate business investment. Gail Fosler of the ConferenceBoard, a business research group, says all the wrangling overthe size of a tax cut, which taxes to cut, and whether itwould help or hurt politically &quot;may keep cuts from passing.&quot;   -- President Bush will keep his job, according to all butsix of the analysts. Two dissenters said Arkansas Gov. BillClinton, a Democrat, will win, two picked an unnamedDemocrat, and two said they have no idea what will happen.                                                                                                          WINNERS AND LOSERS: Nobody in the mid-1991 survey evencame close with their predictions of short-term interestrates. Nearly everyone also missed the dollar by a widemargin. But several came very close to the mark on long-termbonds. And many also came very close on the unemploymentrate.   On short-term rates, the average forecast called forthree-month Treasury bills to yield 5.84% at year end. Theactual number: 3.93%.   That was down sharply from 5.62% six months ago and 6.62%a year ago.   Edward Hyman of ISI Group Inc. came the closest, with his5% forecast. The worst guess was 6.60%, by Alan Reynolds ofthe Hudson Institute.   Six months ago, the consensus forecast called for thedollar to buy 141 Japanese yen by the end of 1991. Instead,the dollar as of Dec. 31 bought 125 yen. The best forecast:Mr. Braverman of DKB Securities, at 130 yen. The mostinaccurate: Jerry Jordan of First Interstate Bancorp. in LosAngeles, at 155 yen.   On long-term bonds, the best forecast of six months agocame from Mr. Hyman, at 7.30%, off by less than one tenth ofa percentage point. Edward Yardeni also was close, at 7.50%.Lawrence Kudlow of Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. predicted 7.70%. SamKahan of Fuji Securities Inc., James Smith of the Universityof North Carolina and David L. Littmann of ManufacturersNational Bank in Detroit each predicted 7.75%. The mostaccurate forecast of one year ago: Mr. Barbera of Lehman, at7.40%. But last summer he revised it to 8.50%.   Irwin L. Kellner, who predicted a 9% bond yield, was wrongby more than 1 1/2 percentage points. &quot;Undaunted by my bigmiss, I'm still a bear on bonds,&quot; says Mr. Kellner, whorecently was named chief economist at Chemical Banking Corp.,formed by the merger of Manufacturers Hanover Corp. andChemical Banking Corp.   Even further from the mark was Morris Markovitz, presidentof Mercury Management Associates Inc. in New York. In aletter dated Jan. 4 of last year, Mr. Markovitz wrote thisreporter to express his indignation about economists' viewsin The Wall Street Journal survey published two days earlier.&quot;I think that, as a group, they're completely off base,&quot; hewrote. &quot;I don't think there's one amongst them thatunderstands what's happening now, so how can they forecastwhat will?&quot;   Unfortunately, Mr. Markovitz didn't stop there. Hevolunteered his own forecasts: Three-month T-bills wouldyield 10.5% by the end of 1991. The yield on 30-year Treasurybonds would soar to 10.2% and inflation in the second half of1991 would be running a sizzling 7% annual rate.   Six months ago, Mr. Markovitz provided updates: T-bills atyear end would yield 6.5%, bonds would yield &quot;9.4% or more,&quot;and second-half inflation would be 6.2%.   &quot;I didn't expect the Fed to be so easy,&quot; Mr. Markovitz nowexplains. &quot;This is an election year, and {Alan Greenspan,chairman of the Federal Reserve Board} caved in politically.I was wrong about the politics and right on the economics.&quot;   It's too early to declare a winner on the economy orinflation, since government figures aren't yet available. Butif there were an award for over-optimism, the winner would beJohn Mueller of Lehrman Bell Mueller Cannon Inc. He hadpredicted 4.6% second-half growth. The actual number willprobably be only about 1%, he and many other analysts nowsay.   Richard Hoey correctly predicted that he would be the onlysurvey participant who personally would reduce the ranks ofthe unemployed. In the spring, he lost his job as chief U.S.economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd. Early in July, he wasnamed chief economist at Dreyfus Corp. &quot;I am no longer WallStreet's leading unemployed economist,&quot; he says with a laugh.&quot;You've got to have a sense of humor about this business.&quot;   ---               A Sampling of Interest Rate,              Economic and Currency Forecasts                                                                                                               (In percent except for the dollar vs. yen)                                                                                                                          June 1991 Survey                                                                                                                                                                                                                       3-Mos.    30-Yr.
