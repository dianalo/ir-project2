The one-ton beasts landed Sunday at Dallas-Fort WorthInternational Airport in the rear of a Boeing 747. The animals aredestined for zoos and ranches, where they will be bred as part of aninternational conservation program.   One of the females is being taken to La Coma Ranch near McAllen,owned by Calvin Bentsen, where it will join 400 other exoticanimals, including a male black rhino named Macho.   ``I told him about it yesterday, and he got all excited,'' jokedBentsen, 63, a cousin of U.S. Sen. Lloyd Bentsen, D-Texas.   One of the rhinos broke a horn during the trip from Harare by wayof Frankfurt, West Germany. Several became dehydrated and weredoused with water inside a cargo terminal before being examined andsprayed with an insecticide to kill any disease-carrying ticks.   ``They're a little tired,'' said veterinarian Sherri Huntress ofthe Dallas Zoo, which is receiving a pair of the animals.   Veterinarians were most concerned about the condition of apregnant rhino, which apparently experienced only normal stress, zooofficials said.   In addition to Bentsen and the Dallas Zoo, the Fort Worth andMilwaukee zoos and the Lee Bass ranch in southern Texas are eachgetting a pair of rhinos, and San Diego's zoo is getting one.   Habitat destruction and poaching have put the animal on the vergeof extinction. Their horns sometimes sell for as much as $4,500apiece, desired as dagger handles and in medicinal potions.   Before the shipment, only eight black rhinos were in the UnitedStates.   There are believed to be fewer than 3,000 southern black rhinosin the wild. In 1970, there were more than 60,000 inhabiting thegrasslands, marshes and forests of Africa.   Bentsen said while in 1960 he shot a black rhino in Kenya, hewouldn't do it now.   ``A true hunter would never shoot an endangered animal,'' Bentsensaid.</TEXT></DOC>
