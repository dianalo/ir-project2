Foster Winans Sues to Keep Royalties from Crime Victim's Board</HEAD><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   R. Foster Winans, the former Wall Street Journalreporter convicted in an insider trading scandal, has gone to courtto keep the state Crime Victims Board from confiscating his bookroyalties.   The board is using the state's ``Son of Sam'' law to try to get$17,000 in royalties that Winans' publisher owes him on his book,``Trading Secrets: Seduction and Scandal at the Wall StreetJournal.''   The law, named for so-called ``Son of Sam'' killer DavidBerkowitz, was passed to keep convicted criminals from profitingfrom their crimes.   Winans, 40, seeking a hearing Wednesday, argued in papers filedin trial-level state Supreme Court that he was convicted of federalcrimes and therefore state laws do not apply and state agencies haveno jurisdiction in his case.   He also raised a First Amendment free speech issue, saying, ``Thelaw cannot possibly be applied to a professional writer since thelaw would then prevent me from pursuing my only occupation.''   Winans' 1985 conviction on 49 counts of conspiracy and fraudstemmed from a scheme in which he passed information from the WallStreet Journal column, ``Heard on the Street,'' which he co-wrote,to stock brokers before it was published. The brokers used theinformation to profit in stock trading.   Winans' 18-month sentence was reduced on appeal to one year andhe was ordered to pay $5,000 to a federal crime victims' fund.   In August 1986, St. Martin's Press published Winans' book abouthis experience. His contracts called for advances of $35,000 forhardcover rights and $30,000 for the paperback rights.   On Jan. 14, 1987, the state Crime Victims Board moved to get the$17,065.54 St. Martin's had not yet paid Winans. Meanwhile, federalauthorities claimed their $5,000 and Winans paid them with money healready had.   In his suit to collect the money his book has earned, Winans alsoargued:   _The Son of Sam law is unconstitutional because it calls forseizure of property without due process.   _The federal crime victims' law requires there be physical harmto a victim, and federal authorities have a victims' reimbursementfund which he paid into.   _That while state law was amended in 1985 to cover federalcrimes, his crimes occurred in 1983-84 before the law was passed andthe law may not be applied retroactively.   _That he was convicted of stealing information from hisemployers, Dow Jones andamp; Co., owners of the Wall Street Journal, andthat a probation report says his former employers not asking for anymonetary recovery.</TEXT></DOC>
