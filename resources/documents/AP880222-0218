Colmans' book, but youcan read it.   The book _ on using computers in public relations and relatedfields _ was written on computer by people contacted via computer,edited on computer and published on computer.   And since it exists only in the memory of a computer inColumbus, Ohio, the book can only be read by using a computer.   ``The essence of the book is to share information on the `thisis how I do it' use of technology in the communications arts,''said Colmans, vice president of an Atlanta public relations firm.   Colmans is one of about six ``system operators'' of a computernetwork called the Public Relations Special Interest Group. Alongwith co-editor Ron Solberg of Chicago, he has compiled the bookover about four years.   In it are chapters written by the public information officer forKansas City, Mo., who tells how he has set up a computer network totell citizens what is happening in the city; discussions of ``voicemail,'' a sophisticated, computer-operated telephone answering andmessage system; and numerous other aspects of how to use technologyin the field.   The computer book, which would be about an inch thick ifprinted, is better than one on paper, Colmans said, because ``onceyou buy a hardcopy book and put it on the shelf, that's it foreternity _ whatever's in the book is the information.''   ``With an on-line book, not only are you not stuck with havingto have all the information sitting on your shelf, ... but theminute something becomes obsolete, bang, it's gone. And the minutesomething comes in that's interesting and new, in a matter of acouple minutes it's on line and available for everybody to see,''he said.   The book _ with the official title of ``The Functional Use ofComputers in Public Relations, Marketing and Advertising'' _ is atrue creature of electronics.   ``Virtually the entire book was brought together throughelectronic mail messages and sharing of text as opposed to voicecommunication,'' Colmans said.   ``There were very few phone calls. ... The book itself wascreated in an electronic communications environment. I have met,face to face, about six of the 40 to 50 people that I communicatewith electronically. Most of them are just type on a screen tome,'' he said.   Colmans is not your average computer hacker, sitting in front ofa terminal, wrapped up in the nuts and bolts, or bits and bytes, oftechnology.   ``About five years ago, I started getting interested incomputers to help me do my work, not just to play with, because I'mone of those people that can't write a program,'' he said.   ``I don't know how a computer works any more than I know how atelevision set works. But I do know how to turn on a TV and I doknow how to turn on a computer.''   In compiling the book, Colmans said, ``the big issue that wediscovered was, and still is today, that there are so many kinds ofcomputers out on the market and there's a real lack ofunderstanding among computer users that ... you can actually getthose computers to talk to each other.''   Because the book has not been published in the traditionalsense, Colmans earns nothing from the people who use it.   ``We have not done this project to make money; we've done thisproject to share information,'' he said, although there has beensome discussion about publishing a ``hardcopy of the book'' in thefuture.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Tuesday Feb 23</NOTE></DOC>
