Some graphs of this factor against the level ofprogressiveness of the equipment are given. A fact which emerges fromanalysis of trends in mine drivage is that roadway cross sections mayhave to increase to the extent where at least 25% of roadways have across section of 12.7 m{sup 2} or over; without this, new technologycannot be used, but on the other hand the technology to drive such roadwaysis not sufficiently available. Therefore the possible variants for developmentof mine drivage need to be considered with reliability in mind when measuresare being taken to increase automation and effectiveness of equipment.2 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
