This rule revises Export Control Commodity Number (ECCN)1572A, which controls recording or reproducing equipment. This revisionhas resulted from a review of strategic controls maintained by the U.S.and certain allied countries through the Coordinating Committee (COCOM).Such multilateral controls restrict the availability of strategic itemsto controlled countries. With the concurrence of the Department of Defense,the Department of Commerce has determined that this rule is necessary toprotect U.S. national security interests.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>June 13, 1988.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>For questions of a technical natureregarding equipment controlled for export under ECCN 1572A, call JosephWestlake, Computer Systems Technology Center, Office of Technology andPolicy Analysis, Telephone: (202) 377-2279.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>   <ITAG tagnum="84">Rulemaking Requirements  </ITAG>1. Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared.  2. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking, an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule also is exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruleimplements regulatory changes based on COCOM review. Further, no otherlaw requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity forpublic comment be given for this rule.  3. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no initial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 4. This rule mentions collections of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>) These collections have been appoved by the Office ofManagement and Budget under control number 0625-0001 and 0625-0140. Thisrule reduces the regulatory burden on exporters by removing the writtenassurance requirement regarding exports of technical data under 1572A. 5. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Exective Order12612.  Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, as with other Departmentof Commerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome.
