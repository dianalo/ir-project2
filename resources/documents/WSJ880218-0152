For the quarter, the oil and gas exploration company expects to report net income of $1.3 million, or six cents a share, compared with a year-earlier deficit of $4.2 million. Full-year net totaled about $24.5 million, or $1.50 a share, the company said, against a loss of $20 million in 1986, which was largely the result of property write-downs.    The company said 1987 revenue totaled about $34 million, which based on nine-month results, would put fourth-quarter revenue at about $8.6 million. In 1986, fourth-quarter revenue was $7.6 million and full-year revenue was $37.6 million.    The company restructured in the 1987 first quarter. Combined with tax-law and accounting changes, the restructuring boosted net income because all of the company's deferred taxes ceased to be a liability, said James Gibbs, president. As a result, the company upwardly restated net income over the first three quarters.    Wainoco's reserves are about 10% oil and 90% natural gas, and that mix will continue, Mr. Gibbs said in an interview. &quot;Over the last five years, that hasn't been to our advantage, but over the next five years it probably will be,&quot; he said.    Wainoco has sharply reduced its long-term debt over the past few years, to the point where it is less than one-third of the company's capitalization, Mr. Gibbs said.    Cash flow from operations totaled about $16.4 million in 1987, up from $15.8 million in 1986, he said.    The company currently has about 250 billion cubic feet of natural gas reserves and 5.2 million barrels of oil reserves.    Capital expenditures, Mr. Gibbs said, rose 65% last year to about $14 million and are expected to rise to $19 million this year. In 1987, 25% of expenditures went to drilling wells, but that will rise to 50% this year, he said.    Wainoco had an interest in about 45 wells that were drilled last year, and that number will rise to 55 or 60 this year, Mr. Gibbs said.    The company has sharply reduced its costs and staff over the past few years. For instance, last year it had general administrative costs of $6 million, compared with $18 million in 1981, Mr. Gibbs said. Staff has been cut to 130 employees from a peak of 278 in the early 1980s, he added. </TEXT></DOC>
