To encourage those producers to find substitutes forozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon chemicals, the agency wants tocharge fees equal to the windfall earnings the manufacturers couldget as prices go up in the face of shortages of CFC compounds.   An international treaty calls for a 50 percent reduction in CFCproduction by 1998, and under EPA's expectations, the CFC shortageswill enable producers to raise prices with no increase inproduction costs. The agency estimated the possible windfall at$1.8 billion to $7.2 billion. The quicker substitutes are adopted,the less the windfall.   The agency gave notice Monday it was considering otherapproaches: Auctions of the right to produce and direct regulationof certain manufacturing processes that might require otherchemicals to be used instead.   An official of the Office of Management and Budget said OMBfavored auctions and would press its view.   ``We think the market ought to be allowed to do its work ratherthan a bunch of bureaucrats like me,'' said Robert K. Dawson,associate director of OMB. ``What is the evidence that we as afederal government can allocate production equitably across firms?''   The notices accompanied the agency's final promulgation ofquotas for CFC producers under the 1987 Montreal treaty requiringthe cuts in CFC production.   EPA expects enough countries to ratify the Montreal treaty forit to take effect next Jan. 1. Eleven nations accounting fortwo-thirds of world production must ratify; six including theUnited States have done so.   The non-toxic, non-flammable and long-lived CFC compounds areused as refrigeration fluids, solvents and blowing agents to makeplastic foams.   CFCs eventually reach the ozone layer 15 miles to 25 miles highthat blocks the cancer-causing ultraviolet rays of the sun. Therethe CFCs destroy ozone.   Scientists blame CFCs for a roughly 2.5 percent decline in theozone layer since about 1960. EPA says each percent means 43,000more cases of skin cancer in the United States, currently about500,000 a year, and the regulations should prevent 3.7 millionearly U.S. deaths among people living now and to be born before2075.   The five U.S. companies producing CFC compounds are limited totheir 1986 production during the 12 months starting next July 1,assuming the treaty takes effect Jan. 1. They will have to make a20 percent cut in 1993, and an additional 30 percent cut in 1998.   Eileen Claussen, acting deputy assistant EPA administrator forair pollution, said EPA was not sure it had authority for either anauction or a fee. The agency concedes a fee might be considered atax that Congress would have to enact.   ``If (an auction) was judged to be illegal, we would havenothing. We wouldn't be in compliance with the Montreal protocol,''she said.   Also, she said, ``There is a concern about hoarding,'' with bigcompanies like automakers able to outbid the thousands of smallcompanies that use CFCs.   Dawson said OMB believed EPA had authority to conduct anauction. Neither agency disputes that in theory, an auction shouldcapture all the windfall for the government because producers willbid for production rights up to the point where production doesn'tmeet their profit goals.   John Hoffman, project officer for the new regulations, said``our concern is the incentive producers might have for keeping anexisting product in production,'' delaying the switch to harmlessalternatives.   ``While higher prices for CFCs and halons will stimulate somefirms and industries to shift to alternate materials, institute orincrease recycling, or produce other products, if substitutes arenot readily available, many firms will have little choice but tocontinue to use these chemicals while paying a higher price,''EPA's notice said.   The five U.S. manufacturers of CFCs are: Du Pont Co.;Allied-Signal Corp.; Pennwalt Corp.; Kaiser Chemicals Co.; andRacon Inc.   Ten other companies import the compounds.   The Du Pont Co. does not believe there will be a windfallbecause substitute compounds are being developed quickly, said JoeSteed, environmental manager for CFCs.   ``If we can fund development at the rate we think we need, we'llbe doing well,'' Steed said. Du Pont says it will end all CFCproduction about the year 2000.   David Doniger, senior attorney with the Natural ResourcesDefense Council, an environmental group, said he would challengethe regulations in court.   Halting ozone depletion ``requires a virtually complete ban onCFCs and other ozone-depleting chemicals. Even then, recovery ofthe ozone layer will take at least a century,'' Doniger said.</TEXT></DOC>
