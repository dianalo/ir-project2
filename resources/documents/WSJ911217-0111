The legal issue is a technical one, relating to whenfederal laws pre-empt state statutes. But the dispute givesthe high court an opportunity to consider the validity of theburgeoning body of state and local laws that are aimed atprotecting public safety but also regulate the workplace.</LP><TEXT>   These state and local laws affect companies in industriessuch as chemicals, waste disposal and manufacturing. Federalcourts, however, have split over the propriety of thelegislation, creating uncertainty for business and fuelinglitigation. In many instances, business prefers uniformfederal regulation to differing state standards.   The case before the Supreme Court began when the NationalSolid Wastes Management Association, a trade group,challenged an Illinois law setting training requirements forcrane operators at hazardous-waste sites. The tradeassociation charged that the state statute was preempted byrules set by the federal Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration. State and local statutes generally arepreempted when they conflict with federal law or whenCongress indicates that a specific area should be regulatedonly by federal authorities.   The federal appeals court in Chicago ruled that theIllinois requirement that hazardous-waste crane operatorshave 4,000 hours of experience was pre-empted by OSHA rules.As a general matter, the appeals court said, state lawsdirectly relating to worker health and safety would bepre-empted by OSHA rules.   Illinois sought Supreme Court review, arguing that stateworkplace-safety laws that also protect the public at largearen't at odds with federal law and shouldn't be pre-empted.The current high court, though considered conservative, hasfrustrated business in recent years by giving state and localauthorities broad latitude to regulate. (Gade vs. NationalSolid Wastes Management Association)   In a separate case, the Supreme Court ruled unanimouslythat federal law doesn't limit the duration of leaveavailable to National Guard reservists who go on activemilitary duty and then return to their civilian jobs.   The federal appeals court in Atlanta had ruled that athree-year leave was unreasonable in the case of an Alabamaguard member who planned to take an active-duty post andwanted to ensure that he could regain his civilian hospitaljob. The high court reversed the decision, stressing that thefederal law on leave for military service contains no timelimit for National Guard members. (King vs. St. Vincent'sHospital)   In another unanimous decision yesterday, the high courtsaid the Justice Department can prohibit people without U.S.citizenship from working in the U.S. as a condition of theirrelease from custody during deportation proceedings.   The high court, in an opinion written by Justice JohnStevens, emphasized that they weren't giving the JusticeDepartment blanket authority to deny working privileges toaliens whom the government is seeking to deport. TheImmigration and Naturalization Service, a branch of theJustice Department, should handle such cases individually,Justice Stevens wrote. Aliens who have so-called green cardsor other work permits may still be allowed to seek employmentpending resolution of deportation proceedings.   But as a general rule, the high court said, immigrationofficials may decide when to ban employment as a condition ofa bond put up by an arrested alien seeking to be releasedfrom jail. (Immigration and Naturalization Service vs.National Center for Immigrants' Rights)   In other action, the Supreme Court:   -- Reiterated in a dispute over the federal Freedom ofInformation Act that the government may prevent disclosure ofpersonal information in official files when the privacyinterest of people described in the files outweighs thepublic interest in disclosure. The justices ruled that theState Department could keep secret the names of illegalHaitian immigrants who had been interviewed by U.S. officialsabout their treatment after they had been returned to Haiti.(State Department vs. Ray)   -- Let stand a lower-court ruling that the JusticeDepartment may require applicants for government attorneyjobs to take a drug test, even in the absence of anysuspicion of drug use. The lawyer in question had applied tobe an antitrust prosecutor. (Willner vs. Barr)</TEXT></DOC>
