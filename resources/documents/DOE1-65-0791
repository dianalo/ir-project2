The cogeneration gas demand forecast in 2000 is 1.2 Tcf in theAttainable Case, 0.8 Tcf and 1.7 Tcf in the Business as Usual Case andPotential Case, respectively. After steady growth in the 1985 to 1990period, cogeneration should resume a rapid growth pattern after 1990.Tight electric utility capacity margins after 1990 will create an opportunityfor more extensive use of cogeneration by industry. The economics ofgas-fired cogeneration are superior to competing fuels for both large-scaleindustrial applications and for commercial applications. Despite thegenerally lower fuel costs for coal, natural gas-fired systems have lowerannualized costs over a wide range of situations. Cogeneration is thelargest of the new markets for natural gas and has the potential to continuethe rapid growth pattern of the 1980s. This paper discusses these pointsin more detail.</TEXT></DOC>
