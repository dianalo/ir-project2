The meeting was announced after soliders ousted four morecommanders in the military, workers struck state-run companies andstreet battles occurred as Haitians released pent-up rage at threedecades of authoritarian rule.   Sporadic gunfire continued throughout the capital today, fourdays after low-ranking soldiers toppled the regime of Lt. Gen.Henri Namphy.   But it was quiet downtown this morning, and a demonstrationscheduled in support of the rebellious soldiers was rescheduled forThursday after its organizers announced they would meet later todaywith the leader of the revolt, Sgt. Joseph Heubreux and the newpresident, Lt. Gen. Prosper Avril.   The decision was praised by a political leader, ChristianDemocrat Sylvio Claude, who was quoted on Radio Lumier as saying,``The emotions of the people are overheated. This is not the momentfor a demonstration.''   Radio reports told Tuesday of a spreading rebellion, with troopsremoving their commanders and reprisal killings by mobs supportedby soldiers.   ``I'm afraid we're on the eve of another insurrection,'' agovernment official, who demanded anonymity, said Tuesday.   Avril, who declared himself president Sunday after the coup,tried to end the unrest by appointing a new armed forces chief andannouncing the retirement of eight generals. But radio stationssaid the revolt in the 7,000-member army spread because Avril hadnot fired commanders the soldiers identified with the corruptionand repression of earlier governments.   Soldiers broadcasting from radio stations _ something unheard ofbefore the coup _ said they identified themselves with thedowntrodden of Haiti. Several repeated on the air: ``The army isthe people, and people are the army!''   The coup leaders have demanded that Avril reorganize themilitary and institute democratic reforms including free elections,which Haiti has not had for 31 years. On Nov. 29, armed thugskilled more than 30 people at polling stations in thwartingindependently run elections.   Radio stations said Tuesday that mutinying soldiers had oustedthe commanders of the navy, port and airport security, the 300-manLeopards Batallion, and the Artibonite Department, a region northof Port-au-Prince.   Workers at the state-owned electricity company, port authorityand flour mill struck to force the removal of their managers, radiostations said.   Workers looted and tore apart the house of Jean-Claude Souriac,head of the electric company, while two armed soldiers stood by,witnesses said.   The flour mill manager also was removed, radio stations said.The managers' fates were not known.   Radio stations said gunmen killed four people in apparentreprisal for atrocities linked to Namphy's government, includingthe Sept. 11 massacre of 13 people during a Mass celebrated by apolitically active Roman Catholic priest.   Ten other people have been reported killed since the coup, whichsent Namphy into exile in the Dominican Republic.   Port-au-Prince Mayor Franck Romain, accused of orderingopposition leaders killed, took refuge in the Dominican Embassy.   On state television Tuesday night, the government announced in acommunique that it had retired eight generals, including Maj. Gen.Williams Regala, who was ousted as interior and defense ministerafter the coup and has not been seen since, and Brig. Gen. CarlMichel Nicolas, former army chief of staff.   The communique said four officers were promoted.   Avril said Tuesday he was aware of ``numerous problems'' withinthe armed forces, but urged his troops ``to stay calm.'' At aceremony outside the National Palace, he appointed a new armedforces commander-in-chief, Maj. Gen. Herard Abraham, who wasforeign minister under Namphy.</TEXT></DOC>
