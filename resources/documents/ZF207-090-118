A better phrase is''automated reasoning,'' suggesting that a computer reaches conclusions byreasoning in an automated fashion.andM;There are a great many applications and implications for artificialintelligence in the future.andP;  The combination of artificial intelligence androbotics will automate many simple, routine, reproducible tasks.andM;What Can Be AutomatedandM;We can automate tasks requiring very complex calculations and logic, theexpertise for which can be reduced to rules.andP;  It's possible today to automatemany clerical and financial support jobs, although we haven't automated thejobs of many professionals.andP;  However, in the future, any task in whichexpertise can be reduced to rules or tasks that require a vast amount ofknowledge can be automated.andM;What tasks won't be automated?andP;  Artistic efforts or tasks performed by highlycreative people -- those, for instance, requiring human empathy andunderstanding: the job of the salesman, leader, film director, orchestraconductor, musician.andM;A large proportion of today's jobs may become automated.andP;  But how fast willthis happen?andP;  And what effect will it have on society?andM;Obviously, the effects will be dramatic and will happen pretty rapidly withinthe next 20 years.andM;Look at manufacturing in the 1950s -- about 40 percent of all Americans wereemployed in the manufacturing sector of the economy.andP;  But according to someprojections, it's likely that by about the year 2015 only 1.5 percent ofAmericans will be in the manufacturing sector.andM;Will this cause massive unemployment?andP;  If most factories are automated, andif we have an enormous amount of competition from countries where labor ischeap, isn't this going to cause major problems?andM;Not necessarily.andP;  We've already seen such a transition in agriculture.andP;  Onestatistic which is rather surprising to us today is that in 1900 about 50percent of Americans worked on farms.andM;That proportion steadily declined to about 20 percent after World War II,dropping much lower in the 1960s, until today only about 1.5 percent ofAmericans work on farms.andP;  So, the percentage of the labor force in themanufacturing sector is likely to drop to about 1.5 percent by the year 2015.andM;In spite of this historical precedent, it's important for society to maintainsomething reasonably close to full employment.andM;It's likely that we can maintain close to full employment because the numberof jobs in the service sector today (such as the information andentertainment industries) is steadily climbing.andM;For example, as we get high-definition television, Ka-band satellites andfiber-optic communication links to the home, we can pick up hundreds oftelevision channels.andP;  A lot of work will be required to create televisionprograms for this future society.andM;Television is very people-intensive, and it's the type of work that can't beautomated.andP;  We're likely to see the television, entertainment and informationbusinesses converge, creating many new jobs in these sectors.andM;And we'll be moving into a world of electronic books, where you can selectany subject and branch into related material in video, speech or other media.andO;The preparation of material in electronic form will require a high level ofeffort and human creativity.andM;In an era of rapidly changing technology, what should universities beteaching now?andM;Unfortunately, universities don't seem to have caught up with computing inthe 1970s, let alone a vision of what computing and jobs are going to looklike by the year 2000.andP;  It's important for universities to understand theeffect of technology on the changing mix of jobs in the future.andM;With the introduction of wideband packet switching, broadband IntegratedServices Digital Network (ISDN) chip sets, multifiber optical trunks, opticalswitching, intelligent networks and so on, telecommunications is undergoing awholesale transformation.andM;We need to understand what telecommunications will look like in 2000 or 2010,given the technology we're developing now.andM;What telecommunications regulations need to be established?andM;What impact will those regulations have on the operators of public andprivate telephone and telecommunications networks?andM;In 1992, our communications will be governed by the Brooks Act, whichmandates an evolution to open architectures to be implemented with the OpenSystems Interconnect (OSI) Reference Model and ISDN.andM;But to move to open architectures, we must have standards, and thosestandards must be controlled.andM;Standards will lead to the manufacture of products that are certified by theNational Institute of Standards and Technology.andM;The Brooks Act states that it will be illegal for any government departmentto build a telecommunications network using equipment that has not beencertified to support an open architecture.andP;  This will lead to vast networksin which millions of computers can be connected together in an openenvironment.andM;From our current perspective, future technological advances seem limitless.andO;However, as these advances occur, we need to ask: What could go wrong?andP;  Whatare the worst things that could happen?andM;One of the worst scenarios is our accidentally drifting into another Cubanmissile crisis or some other type of crisis in the Middle East.andM;Perhaps a breaking away of peripheral parts of the Soviet Union might causegreat unrest in Poland or behind the Iron Curtain.andM;The danger is that we might drift into a situation in which events fly out ofcontrol, and we could find ourselves at risk of nuclear war.andM;Where the Danger Really LiesandM;Much more important than nuclear weapons themselves are thecommand-and-control computer systems, which set the pattern for events thatcould lead to an inadvertent nuclear war.andM;Today's command-and-control systems are referred to as ''meta-stable,'' whichmeans that, initially, the systems are extremely safe and well-locked.andM;However, if we move toward a serious crisis, we have to start taking thelocks off.andP;  We then move from a fail-safe situation to a ''fail-deadly''situation.andM;Our technology is dangerous not because of the missiles themselves butbecause of the command-and-control systems we've built.andP;  Therefore, astechnical professionals, we should be looking at the changes we can make intechnology to prevent the worst scenarios from happening.andM;We're at one of the most extraordinary moments in history.andP;  Rather than driftinto nuclear catastrophe, we have the opportunity to use rapidly developingtechnology to make an entirely different and better society.andM;The computer field is going to be the most exciting industry in which youcould possibly work during the next 20 years.andP;  If we look at the model offuture technology I mentioned earlier, we're now moving into a period of timein which the rate of change is going to be phenomenal, and we'd better beprepared for it.andM;Next week I'll begin a series of four articles on ISDN -- an informationnetwork of the future that integrates voice, text, data and video in anopen-communications architecture.andM;----------The James Martin Productivity Series, an information service updatedquarterly, is available through High Productivity Software Inc., ofMarblehead, Mass.andP;
