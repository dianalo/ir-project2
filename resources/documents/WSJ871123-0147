It's now giving vocal emphasis to its policy of encouraging the dollar to fall against such almighty currencies as the South Korean won, and the Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan dollars. So we will all now have another chance to learn that treating the dollar as if it were the peso is not sound policy.    In a speech in San Francisco last week, Assistant Treasury Secretary David Mulford took the strongest and most public swipe yet at the policies of the four Asian NICs, or newly industrializing countries. Referring to the &quot;four tigers,&quot; as they're commonly known, Mr. Mulford said ominously, &quot;Tigers are a shrinking population. To survive, tigers -- and the NICs -- must adapt; and adaptation will require cooperative, not predatory, behavior.&quot;    Everyone likes cooperation, but publicly beating up on countries is not the best way to encourage it. Talking down the dollar -- against any currencies -- only one week after we nearly had a complete dollar collapse is also peculiar timing. One might have thought that exchange-rate stability was a more prudent goal.    Mr. Mulford, however, made it clear that his idea of cooperation is for the NICs to revalue their currencies against the dollar. Policies that promote overvalued exchange rates, Mr. Mulford said, have &quot;in my view . . . played the central role in the NICs' recent rise as trading powers.&quot;    The main cause of the NICs' rise has been policies that give their citizens incentives to work, save and invest. This is called capitalism, and the NICs practice it. As for the exchange rate, it often makes good economic sense for a small trading nation to link its currency to a world reserve currency. A pegged currency can allow small economies to make themselves adjuncts of the world-trading system, sending their producers accurate signals about world prices. Investment flows are also less easily distorted.    Asking Hong Kong to revalue is especially silly because its pegged system has made it virtually another branch of the Federal Reserve System. Its monetary policy and inflation rates are virtually the same as our own. Mr. Mulford might as well ask Montana to revalue. It is certainly true that government controls on capital flows distort things more in Korea and Taiwan, but the main problem is with the controls, not the exchange rate.    To be fair, Mr. Mulford did have sensible things to say on other matters. He noted how South Korea and Taiwan use high tariffs, subsidies and other government controls that kowtow to domestic political interests but also reduce the living standards of their own citizens.    The Reagan administration's impulse has been to be seen to be &quot;doing something,&quot; anything, on trade to head off the protectionists in Congress. Speaker Wright just announced that the trade conference is so confused it won't be over until February, but he's still determined to prompt a presidential veto. Trade talks that open markets -- such as those just concluded with Canada -- offer much more hope of blunting protectionists, however, than currency devaluation or NIC-bashing. The world's markets want freer trade and a stable dollar, not an almighty won. </TEXT></DOC>
