Bedelia plays the widow of a slain policeman in the Home BoxOffice movie ``Somebody Has To Shoot the Picture,'' which debutsWednesday, Sept. 12.   She also plays Bruce Willis' wife in ``Die Hard 2'' and HarrisonFord's wife in ``Presumed Innocent.''   ``If I'd been in `Ghost,' I'd be in the three biggest picturesof the summer,'' she said.   In the HBO movie, Arliss Howard, about to be executed forkilling Bedelia's husband seven years earlier, requests that aburned-out photographer played by Roy Scheider photograph theexecution.   Scheider reluctantly accepts the job. When the execution isstayed for 48 hours, an alcoholic ex-cop who was at the murderscene kills himself. Scheider finds an old photograph among hiseffects that refutes crucial evidence at the trial and indicates acover-up might have taken place.   ``Although Hannah has an affair with the photographer, this isnot a love story,'' Bedelia said of her character. ``This washed-upphotographer comes to town and she's bowled over. She's been awidow for a long time, and sometimes it takes someone from theoutside.   ``She's a working-class woman, and he's famous. She even goes tothe library to look up his work. They're not in love. It was justan impulsive thing.''   Their fling is the backdrop for a complicated story that evenBedelia admits she had difficulty following. Director Frank Piersonused the opportunity to also examine the issue of capitalpunishment, which he said in an HBO press release that he opposes.   Robert Carradine plays the murdered policeman's partner, andAndre Braugher is a reporter. The screenplay was written by DougMagee, a photojournalist who published a book on death rowprisoners in 1980.   Pierson co-wrote the screenplay for ``Presumed Innocent,'' butBedelia did not meet him until he directed ``Somebody Has To Shootthe Picture.''   She said she didn't find her character to be as complicated asthe story.   ``She was a woman whose husband had been killed, and she hadstayed in the town,'' she said. ``I don't know why, but it wasn'timportant to the story. ... I don't imagine she was verywell-educated. It wasn't a part that required a lot of delving. Shewas a simple person.''   Bedelia said her three recent roles, two wives and a widow, havelittle in common.   ``In `Die Hard 2,' she's an executive of a multinationalcorporation. Her husband's a cop. She probably makes five timeswhat he does. She's left him. She's totally secure and confident.In `Presumed Innocent,' she's a mathematician who's totally caughtup in her work at the university. She's insecure and hasdeep-rooted problems stemming from her childhood. In the HBO movie,she's a manicurist married to a cop who was killed in his rookieyear.   ```Die Hard' was a lark. It's not something you have to give alot of thought to. It's not meant to be deep. It's bang-bang-bang.In `Presumed Innocent,' she's an interesting person. She's verybright, but not very confident. She's insecure, and her husbandgives her a lot of reason to be.''   Bedelia grew up in New York, and made her acting debut at theage of 7. She had been in six Broadway shows by the time she was 17.   She appeared in more than a hundred shows during the heyday oflive television drama and also worked in several series filmed inNew York, such as ``Naked City,'' ``East Side, West Side'' and``The Defenders.''   Her career reached a low point in 1980 when she returned to workafter her second son entered kindergarten. But in 1983, she playedrace driver Shirley Muldowney in ``Heart Like a Wheel,'' a turningpoint for her.   In November, she will co-star with Billy Crystal in ``CitySlickers,'' a comedy about a group of city dwellers who sign up fora vacation cattle drive.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions Aug. 31-Sept. 2</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
