The results are consistent with linear stabilityanalyses during the initial portion of the transient, but also enablecalculations at long times approaching breakup. Nonlinearities associatedwith inertial stresses lead to the formation of satellite droplets forNewtonian jets. The retardation of disturbance growth and stabilizationof viscoelastic jets at long times is shown to be a consequence of nonlinearitiesassociated with the buildup of large extensional stresses.</TEXT></DOC>
