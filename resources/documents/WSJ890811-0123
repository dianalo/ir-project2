In spite of statistics showing that about 70% of all commodity traders come out losers on an annual basis, thousands of commodity brokerage accounts are opened each year by optimistic individual traders.    And now with the recent indictments of 46 floor traders who work at the Chicago exchanges, would-be commodity traders are becoming aware of yet more obstacles to the profits they seek: Many of the offenses these traders were charged with involve defrauding customers.    So why bother to learn a game that is extremely difficult to win when played honestly, and even harder when some of the players are dishonest?    The answer: Success can bring immense rewards. A recent study by Barclay Trading Group of Fairfield, Iowa, showed that a few professional commodity trading advisers have posted five-year track records with compound annual returns exceeding 50%.    Most people don't realize that there are a few simple precautions that, if followed, could improve their chances of success markedly -- though not necessarily turn them into traders with 50%-a-year profits. Moreover, by understanding and using the various kinds of orders available for entering and leaving the markets it is possible to severely limit the opportunities for fraud by those who work in the pits. It should also be noted that although nearly 50 floor traders were indicted last week, there are thousands of traders on the floors of commodity exchanges who aren't suspected of dishonesty.    Before considering some simple do's and don'ts, it is first necessary to understand what commodity traders buy and sell. A futures contract is an obligation to buy (for those who have purchased a contract) or deliver (for those who sold one) a specified quantity of a commodity at the agreed-upon price by a certain date. Most contracts are simply nullified by an opposite trade before they come due. There are futures in a variety of traditional commodities, such as corn and gold, as well as financial instruments such as stock index futures and U.S. Treasury bonds.    What follows is the minimum that neophytes should do before they start trading, though these suggestions of course don't guarantee success.    Educate yourself: Thoroughly study at least one entry-level book on commodities. In that way, you will know how to enter orders and have some idea of how to approach the markets. Two beginning books on commodity trading are &quot;Getting Started in Futures&quot; by Todd Lofton (New York: John Wiley andamp; Sons, 1989); &quot;Facts on Futures&quot; by Jake Bernstein (Chicago: Probus Publishing Co., 1987).    Use risk funds only: If you can't afford to lose, stay away. Many newcomers to the market fall victim to mail order or television pitches that essentially promise fat profits if you buy this computer program or that trading system. With such assurances, some neophytes take money usually reserved for essentials, buy the trading system and start right in, only to find themselves busted out of the market in three weeks.    Have a trading plan: Jack Schwager, director of futures research at PrudentialBache Securities Inc., points out that many traders come into the market impulsively -- say, for example, because they see on the evening news that it is hot in the Midwest and that's bad for the soybean crop. He says that the beginning trader then rushes to buy soybean futures, discovering too late that the market prices already have taken that weather into account.    Bo Thunman, editor of Club 3000, an information exchange service published in Kalamazoo, Mich., says the hardest part for a beginner is figuring out how markets move and thus when to take positions and when not to. &quot;People sometimes have the idea that they can buy a $99 system and make lots of money,&quot; he says, but that is naive.    Set a limit on how many dollars you're willing to lose on each trade: Every trader, beginner or experienced, must decide how much to risk in the market as a whole or on any given trade and stick with it.    Consider professional help: Commodity markets move fast, and thus require near-constant attention to both avoid disaster and spot opportunities. If you doubt that you can carry on your regular job and still devote two or three hours a day to the markets, then consider turning your risk capital over to a commodity trading adviser or putting it into a commodity mutual fund. But first secure and read their disclosure documents, which detail the fees and trading records.    And there are some things you should never do when contemplating commodity trading.    Don't rush into trading: Louis Mendelsohn, a commodity trading systems developer, says the markets are always going to be there, so what's the rush? He suggests that after the fundamentals have been learned, a neophyte trader should spend some time &quot;paper trading&quot; -- that is, entering trades only on paper without putting real money into the market. There is a contrary view on paper trading that says it is almost worthless because without real money on the line a trader's emotional state is vastly different.    Don't start big: An old saw asks: Do you know how to make a small fortune in commodities? Answer: Start with a large one. To avoid that trap, start with a small account and aim to make it grow. In commodity trading, however, a $10,000 account isn't considered a large one.    Ignore telephone solicitations: If you receive a telephone call from someone you don't know who promises to make you a fortune trading commodities or options, hang up immediately and save a lot of money.    Don't grant discretion: Do not give to a broker the right to trade your account unless he can produce an independently authenticated record of his trading performance. A few unscrupulous brokers might take such freedom as a license to generate commissions in the account without regard to your profitability.    Don't overdiversify: Initially, don't try to trade in more than three markets at once. You will be plenty busy following those in a small account. Also make sure you don't trade two or three related markets at the same time because if you are wrong on one you are likely to be wrong on the others as well.    Don't add to a losing position: If a trade is going against you, resist doing more of the same on the old stock market theory that doing so will lower your average costs. Traders who follow this strategy in commodities generally &quot;average&quot; themselves out of the market. Instead, stick with a position until it loses the maximum you allowed yourself when you opened it, then get out.    All successful commodity traders are very self-disciplined and play the game seriously. &quot;If you view futures trading as a hobby,&quot; says James F. Dalton, president of Dalton Capital Management Inc., a commodity trading and educational firm based in Chicago, &quot;be prepared to lose a lot of money.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
