The importance of the depreciation provisions inthe Canadian income tax law to the economics of cogeneration financingis discussed, along with corresponding US tax write-off practices. Theeconomics of cogeneration investment are examined; assumptions used inindustry for cogeneration viability are that the process has to be ableto use 80% of the heat in the fuel used, at an installed cost maximumof $1,000/kW with a 4-year payback period, and must be able to be usedat least 6,550 hours per year. Technical possibilities for cogenerationinclude small hydro and wood waste utilization in the paper industry.Project financing in Canada and the USA are compared, with Canadian projectsdetermined by their ability to generate cash flow. Government and electricutility policies regarding cogeneration are also considered. Barriersto adopting parallel generation (with interconnection to establishedutilities) in Canada are political, economic and technical, and correspondingUS developments are outlined. In Ontario, it is believed that parallelgeneration can deliver 50-150 MW from small hydro, over 1,000 MW fromcogeneration and 50-300 MW from municipal waste. 8 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
