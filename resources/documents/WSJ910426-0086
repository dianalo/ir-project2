Defense Secretary Dick Cheney said his revised &quot;managementreform&quot; blueprint envisions a sweeping consolidation ofmilitary laboratories, maintenance depots, data processingfacilities and intelligence organizations. Such activitiestraditionally have been handled separately by each of themilitary services.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Cheney hopes the new moves will save the Pentagon $70billion over the next seven years. More than one-third ofthat would result from reduced payroll costs, as about 50,000civilian, acquisition-related jobs would be eliminated by theend of 1995. Earlier Pentagon plans would have cut about30,000 such positions.   Overall, Mr. Cheney envisions trimming the DefenseDepartment's civilian work force of roughly one million bynearly 20% by the mid-1990s. Other major savings are expectedfrom eventual consolidation of 27 separate civilian payrollsinto one system, tighter controls over thousands ofwarehouses and reduction of the military's $100 billioninventory of spare parts and various equipment.   Even before the changes are put into place, critics arechallenging the extent of the probable cost savings. CharlesBowsher, head of the General Accounting Office, told theSenate Armed Services Committee that many of the Pentagon'sprojections weren't supported by the facts. He said hisauditors &quot;already have identified&quot; billions of dollars ofprojected &quot;savings that will not come to fruition.&quot;   Mr. Bowsher's prepared testimony, for example, said thePentagon's long-term spending blueprint overstates by $5.5billion the savings from certain base closings by the end of1997. And he questioned whether the changes &quot;adequatelyaddress the problems of inventory visibility, accuracy andaccountability.&quot;   Frank Conahan, the GAO's senior military analyst, said thePentagon couldn't substantiate 80% of the savings projectedby an earlier version of the reform plan. &quot;These amountedonly to sheer projections and personal opinion&quot; on the partof Pentagon planners, he said.   The latest management proposals, outlined during a newsconference yesterday, in many ways highlight the erosion ofpower of the various military services and their uniformedchiefs during an era of declining defense spending. &quot;Thechanges we are making have a fundamental impact on how thePentagon does business now and in the future,&quot; Mr. Cheneysaid, &quot;although I realize they're not as sexy as many of theother things we do.&quot;   The Pentagon's $10 billion-a-year maintenance and repairsystem, for instance, would rank among the top 25 U.S.companies in size. But, said Deputy Defense Secretary DonaldAtwood, &quot;We've been running it as a diverse, disparate sortof organization&quot; without adequate financial controls.   As part of the overall costs-saving effort, Mr. Cheneydisclosed that a month ago he ordered consolidation ofmilitary intelligence-gathering and assessment operationsunder the Defense Intelligence Agency. So-called jointintelligence centers will be set up around the world tocollect and disseminate intelligence information, accordingto the Pentagon management reform plan.   More importantly, the DIA will have more authority todetermine the accuracy of various intelligence informationand to spearhead counterintelligence efforts within thePentagon. For the first time, the management reportindicates, the DIA will have the authority and resources toprepare independent reports on foreign military capabilitiesfor use by officials in making weapons-acquisition decisions.In the past, such analyses by the services tended to supportthe top-priority weapons programs advocated by each branch.</TEXT></DOC>
