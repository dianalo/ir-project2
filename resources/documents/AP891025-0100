The report is the result of a nine-month study by 36 lawyers andlaw professors whose effort was suggested by Sen. Joseph Biden,D-Del., chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee.   Biden called the report's recommendations ``an important andencouraging start,'' and said his committee ``will give a highpriority to civil justice reform.''   The report focuses on federal courts only, but the task forcesaid its recommendations could be applied to state and local courtsas well.   The task force urged Congress to provide ``a mix of suggestionsand incentives'' to spark change, ``and then let those who use thesystem fill in the details.''   ``Our core recommendations allow each federal court ... todevelop its own set of reforms for reducing delay and litigationcosts within some broad parameters that Congress would establishthrough federal legislation,'' the report says.   The task force recommended:   _That Congress require all federal trial judges to streamlinethe pretrial exchange of information between both sides of alawsuit. That process, called ``discovery,'' accounts for anestimated 60 percent of all federal litigation costs.   _Each trial court's streamlining plan should include a system ofassigning differing ``tracks'' to cases of different complexity.Fixed timetables and deadlines for completion of discovery and thestart of a trial would depend on what track a case is assigned.   _Judges should adopt ``a firm and consistent policy forminimizing continuances'' or exceptions to the fixed deadlinesimposed.   _Clients, either in person or by telephone, should participatein any court-sponsored settlement conferences. That would make it``impossible for the attorneys to delay settlement discussions,often for weeks or months, with the time-honored excuse, `Let meget back to you after I've discussed this with my client,''' thetask force report said.   _Judges should not rely on magistrates as heavily as some now doin keeping track of civil cases that have not yet gone to trial.   The report also recommended increasing judges' administrativestaffs and raising judges' salaries.   And the report called for cooperation from the country's lawyers.   ``The nation needs _ and must get _ a substantial commitmentfrom the bar to address this challenge as well,'' it said. ``Thereis a consensus that some litigation costs are incurred as a directoutgrowth of the incentives that have been built into the privatelegal industry itself.''   The task force noted that the legal profession increasingly isdominated by escalating lawyer salaries and heavier demands forbillable hours.   ``The time has come for the profession to examine the impact ofcosts on the delivery of legal services and the critical questionwhether increasing costs have impeded access to the courts,'' thetask force report said.</TEXT></DOC>
