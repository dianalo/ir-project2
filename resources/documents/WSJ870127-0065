A spokesman for the Guild, which has 6,000 members, said that about 90% of the 3,262 members who cast ballots voted in favor of affiliation with the Teamsters. The Teamsters union also represents movie studio drivers and culinary workers.    On Dec. 29, the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers implemented pay cuts ranging from 25% to 40% after Guild members voted down a proposed contract earlier that month. The producers said it was necessary to reduce screen extras' wages to compete with nonunion movie makers. Under the old contract, screen extras were paid $91 a day. Under the provisions implemented last month, pay was reduced to $68 for an eight-hour day and $54 for a six-hour day.    The Guild spokesman said a date hadn't been set for the strike.    Screen extras are background people who fill out crowd scenes in movies and TV shows.    The Guild spokesman said he is confident that the Teamsters will accept the Screen Extras as an affiliated union. Teamsters officials couldn't be reached for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
