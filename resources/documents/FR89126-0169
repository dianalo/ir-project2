Telephone: (202) 732-4503.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>On September 29, 1988 at 53 FR 38254,the Secretary published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> a Notice of Proposed Funding Priorities for fiscalyears 1989 and 1990, for certain program competitions under the Officeof Special Education and Rehabilitative Services.This notice announces final funding priorities for fiscal years 1989 and1990. Additional priorities for fiscal years 1989 and 1990 will be publishedin future editions of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. One priority that was proposed under the EducationalMedia, Research, Production, Distribution and Training Program to provideclosed-captioning of movies, mini-series, and specials, will not be includedin this notice. This activity will be funded as a contract rather thana cooperative agreement in fiscal year 1989.A notice requesting transmittal of applications under these prioritiesis published in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes</ITAG>A total of fourteen comments were received in response to the proposedpriorities. As a result of comments, changes were made to three priorities:(1) Two priorities under Handicapped Children's Early Education Programfor Outreach Projects have been combined into one priority; (2) under Programsfor Severely Handicapped Persons, a priority has been modified to addressthe problems students with severe disabilities who use assistive technologyhave when attending regular education classes; and, (3) under Programsfor Severely Handicapped Children, the final report requirements for onepriority have been modified to expand the type of educational settingsfor which results shall be reported. The Secretary has also made some technicalchanges in the wording of the priorities to provide greater clarity andto remove paperwork requirements that can be handled through other means.A discussion of the requests for clarification and changes on each individualpriority follows:Handicapped Children's Early Education Program_Nondirected DemonstrationProjects<T3>Comment:</T3> One commenter encouraged model demonstrations that emphasizeinteragency collaboration, efficacy of different service models and effectiveuse of staff.<T3>Discussion: </T3>These projects are allowable under the nondirecteddemonstration priority. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the use of assistive technologyand services be included in the nondirected demonstration priority andthat proposals addressing the use of that technology in integrated daycare settings be given priority over other proposals. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary recognizes the importance of assistivetechnology in facilitating the integration of children with severe handicapsinto regular education programs. The intent of the nondirected demonstrationpriority is to support a wide range of applications and to invite applicantsto address issues that will accommodate the child care needs of workingparents who have young children with handicaps. Projects demonstratingthe use of assistive technologies are allowable under this priority. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. Nondirected Experimental Projects <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested that the level of funding beincreased to minimum of $200,000 per application. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary recognizes the importance of fundingexperimental projects at a level sufficient to enable researchers to conducteffective research. Projects recently funded under this program have demonstratedthat effective research can be conducted within the funding range of $100,000to $150,000. However, the funding level for each approved application willbe determined on an individual basis and may range below and above theaverage level proposed. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. Mulit-disciplinary Training Programs for Child Care Personnel <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern that the multidisciplinarytraining programs for child care personnel include an invitation for submissionby community based, nonprofit organizations. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary encourages submissions by communitybased, nonprofit organizations. The priority lists programs conducted bynonprofit public or private sector as an appropriate target for the model.The invitation by the Secretary includes applications from organizationsthat are interested in expanding current child care services to includeservices for children with handicaps. Projects demonstrating the expansionof child care services to community-based, nonprofit organizations areallowable under this priority. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter encouraged the inclusion of families, specialeducators, occupational therapists, physical therapists, speech and languagepathologists, paraprofessionals, nutritionists, nurses, social workersand families in multi-disciplinary teams. <T3>Discussion: </T3>This priority allows in-service training for childcare workers to include coordination with families and a variety of relatedservices personnels. <T3>Changes: </T3>None. State-wide Outreach Projects <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter expressed concern regarding the divisionof outreach efforts into a single State outreach priority and a nationalor mulit-State outreach priority. The commenter stated that a single Statefocus unnecessarily limits the impact potential of an outreach project;the commenter recommended several other ways in which the priorities shouldbe developed. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees with the commenter that the distinctionbetween single-State outreach and multi-State outreach would limit thefocus of the outreach projects. Because funding constraints limit the numberof awards under these priorities, the Secretary chooses to allow greaterflexibility on the part of the applicants by eliminating the distinctionbetween the two priorities.<T3>Changes: </T3>State Outreach and National Outreach priorities havebeen combined into a single priority with several invitational requests.Early Childhood Research Institute_Integrated Programs<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter provided a series of recommendations foradditional areas of research within the proposed research institute onIntegrated Programs. The first recommendation emphasized the need to conductlongitudinal research on many of the issues set forth in the priority.The second addressed the need to include research on legal, administrative,and fiscal issues that relate to least restrictive environment.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary concludes that the priority allows forthe inclusion of studies on these topics.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Postsecondary Education Programs for Handicapped Persons_PostsecondaryDemonstration Projects<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter endorsed the priority and suggested theestablishment of an evaluation criterion that would compare dropouts withdisabilities and dropouts without disabilities from postsecondary programs.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The regulations at 34 CFR Part 338 set forth the evaluativecriteria to be used in evaluating applications under this program. Includedis a criterion for determining the soundness of the evaluations that areplanned for the project described. The criterion is worded such that decisionsare made on the match between stated objectives for the project and theevaluation methods for determining the effectiveness of attaining the projectobjectives. The specific consideration proposed by the commenter may notnecessarily apply to all submissions under the announced priority.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Programs for Severely Handicapped Children<T3>Comments: </T3>Three commenters expressed concern that no priorityaddressed the dissemination of information pertaining to deaf-blindness,and urged that such a priority be developed.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The proposed priority titled ``Utilization of InnovativePractices for Children with Deaf-Blindness'' includes the provision forthe funding of a project to develop and disseminate information on deaf-blindness.In addition, information on deaf-blindness is disseminated through theState and multi-State deaf-blind projects and the technical assistanceprojects funded under the Services for Deaf-Blind Children and Youth Program.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter observed that the proposed priorities didnot include ``Technical assistance to State agencies to facilitate thetransition of deaf-blind youth upon attaining age 22 from education toother services,'' as authorized by section 622 of Part C, EHA, and urgedthat this priority be added.<T3>Discussion: </T3>This priority is included in regulations at 34 CFRPart 307. The Secretary anticipates including this priority along withothers when an application notice for the Services for Deaf-Blind Childrenand Youth Program is announced later this year.<T3>Change: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended that in addition to the announcedpriorities, a priority needs to be added to fund a deaf-blind researchinstitute, which would focus on the transition of deaf-blind youth fromschool to adult life.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The importance of the suggested research is recognizedas being among the most significant areas pertaining to deaf-blind youththat needs investigation. However, since over the past three years theDepartment has supported several demonstration projects addressing theissues of transition and supported work for deaf-blind youth, the Secretaryintends to analyze the results of these projects as an interim step beforedeveloping an institute such as that suggested.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested the addition of a priority thatwould assure that blind, visually impaired and deaf-blind children receivethe appropriate services that they require in integrated settings.<T3>Discussion: </T3>It is the intent of each of the proposed prioritiesunder the Programs for Severely Handicapped Children, CFDA No. 84.086,that the services that they support will be appropriate services providedin integrated settings to the maximum extent appropriate.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended the addition of a priorityto address the problems students with severe disabilities who use assistivetechnology have when attending regular education.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary recognizes the importance of addressingthese problems.<T3>Changes: </T3>Priority No. 2 under the Program for Severely HandicappedChildren has been modified to provide for the funding of projects addressingthese problems.<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter observed that under several prioritiesa common thread appears to be that the outcome must be that children withdeaf-blindness be educated within classrooms of peers who are non-handicapped.The commenter expressed concern that the restrictive nature of this approachmay preclude the support of model services to those children in other educationalsettings.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary recognizes that solutions to problemsin the delivery of services may be tested in a range of settings, and hasmodified the final reporting requirements under the priority titled ``ValidatedPractices: Children with Deaf-Blindness''. However, with the intent toextend the range of innovative approaches for providing educational servicesto this population, the Secretary elects to retain the original languageof the other proposed priorities.<T3>Changes: </T3>The final reporting requirements of priority No. 5 havebeen modified to require that grantees report on principles learned ortested for solving specific problems in educating children with deaf-blindnesswithout regard to the educational setting in which services are provided.Secondary Education and Transitional Services for Handicapped Youth ProgramFamily Networking<T3>Comments: </T3>One commenter wants the priorities to foster familynetworking through existing groups in the community.<T3>Discussion: </T3>Existing community groups such as service organizations,churches, and hospitals, mentioned by the second commenter are eligibleapplicants under this priority.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.Technology, Educational Media and Materials for the Handicapped Program<T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested that the Technology program (CFDA84.180) should stress the development of toys and materials which are play-oriented.<T3>Discussion: </T3>The purpose of Part G of the Education of the HandicappedAct is for `` * * * advancing the use of new technology, media, and materialsin the <T3>education</T3> of handicapped students * * * '' (italic added). Theemphasis on education in the Act does not preclude the utilization of technologyor materials which are oriented toward educational ``play'' under eitherof the priorities, as long as the design formats are consistent with thepriorities as a whole.<T3>Changes: </T3>None.<ITAG tagnum="84">Title of Program: Handicapped Children's Early Education Program </ITAG><T3>CFDA No.: </T3>84.024<T3>Purpose: </T3>To provide Federal support for a variety of activitiesdesigned to address the special problems of infants and children with handicaps,from birth through age eight and their families, and to assist State andlocal entities in expanding and improving programs and services for thoseinfants, toddlers, and children and their families. Activities includedemonstration, outreach, experimental, research and training projects,and research institutes.<T3>Priorities: </T3>The Secretary establishes the following funding prioritiesfor the Handicapped Children's Early Education Program, CFDA No. 84.024.In accordance with the Education Department General Administrative Regulations(EDGAR) in 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3), the Secretary will give an absolute preferenceunder this program to applications that respond to the following priorities;that is, the Secretary will select for funding only those applicationsproposing projects that meet these priorities.Priority 1. Coordinated Service Delivery for Infants and Toddlers withIdentified Handicapping Conditions. (CFDA No. 84.024)This priority supports demonstration projects that design and evaluatemodel procedures for actively involving families in (1) the assessmentof needs, planning and decision-making that result in the individualizedfamily service plan (IFSP); and (2) the implementation of the plan. Modelsdeveloped under this priority must build on current research findings regardingfamily involvement in service programs and family decision-making. Themodels must identify barriers that hinder family involvement and shouldidentify and develop processes to support and enhance family involvementin the development and implementation of the IFSP. Procedures for implementationof the IFSP must include a case management system for the family that includesinteragency coordination of all the early intervention services identifiedin the IFSP. This system must include strategies for assuring that servicesstipulated in the IFSP are provided by all identified service providers,that the financial responsibilities related to the delivery of servicesare met by the responsible agencies, that there is regular communicationand coordination among all service providers involved in services to aparticular child or family, and that the IFSP is reviewed and revised periodically.The model must be evaluated using multiple case studies. Cases must includethe families of infants and toddlers with identified handicapping conditions(e.g., children with Down's Syndrome, severe visual and/or hearing impairments,cerebral palsy, myleomenigecele) or with conditions that have a high probabilityof producing handicaps and that require medical intervention (e.g., extremelylow birth weight of less than 750 grams, or AIDS-related complex). To assurethat procedures are applicable to a range of families (including two-parentfamilies, single-parent families, foster families, families with parentswho are developmentally disabled, and low-income families) the case mustalso represent a range of families. The evaluation design should includeassessment of outcomes for families and children as well as measures offamily involvement and satisfaction. Projects must produce a manual delineatingthe procedures for enhancing family involvement in developing and usingthe IFSP and for case management to assure coordinated services, as wellas sample case studies and outcome data for families who participated inthe project.Final reports submitted by projects funded under this priority must includeboth the specific findings of the project as well as general principlesthat have been learned or tested for developing interventions for involvingfamilies in the development and implementation of the IFSP. Quantifiableinformation from project evaluation activities must also be included alongwith precise information regarding the procedures for the interventionsand contexts in which they were implemented as well as available cost information.Priority 2. Nondirected Demonstrations (CFDA No. 84.024)This priority supports demonstration projects that develop, implement,and evaluate new or improved approaches for serving young children withhandicaps (ages birth through eight). Projects funded under this prioritymust design models that allow young children with handicaps to achievetheir optimal functioning level within normalized, nonsegregated environments.Projects must (1) address a specific service problem or issue; (2) includespecific components or procedures of the model and the rationale, basedon theory, research, or practice evaluation, for those components or procedures;(3) include specific types of students to participate in the project (i.e.,by age, handicapping condition or diagnosis, level of functioning) and(4) include an evaluation design that includes functional outcome measuresfor the young children with handicaps who participate in the proposed intervention(s).Final reports submitted by projects funded under this priority must includeboth the specific findings of the project as well as general principalsthat have been learned or tested for developing interventions for youngchildren with handicaps. Quantifiable information from project evaluationactivities must also be included along with precise information regardingthe procedures for the interventions and the contexts in which they wereimplemented as well as available cost information.The Secretary particularly invites applications for demonstration projectsthat develop models for delivering, coordinating, or supplementing neededdevelopmental, special educational, or related services to infants, toddlers,or preschool-aged children with handicaps who are in day-care programs(home-based, center-based, or home or center based in conjunction withpart-day special education preschool programs). This invitational priorityresponds to the growing number of young children, including children withhandicaps, who are placed in day-care services to accommodate the child-careneeds of working parents. However, applications that meet this invitationalpriority will not receive a competitive preference over other applicationsfor demonstration projects that develop, implement, and evaluate new orimproved approaches for serving young children with handicaps (ages birththrough eight).Priority 3. Multi-disciplinary Training Programs Child Care Personnel (CFDANo. 84.024)This priority supports demonstration projects that develop and evaluatein service training models that will prepare professionals and paraprofessionalsto provide, coordinate, or enhance early intervention, special education,and related services to infants and toddlers with handicaps and/or preschool-agedchildren with handicaps. Model projects must provide inservice trainingfor professionals and paraprofessionals who are already engaged in theprovision of child care, who have not been trained to serve infants andtoddlers with handicaps and/or preschoolers with handicaps, but who arecommitted to serving these children in programs with nonhandicapped children.In developing their model, projects must identify existing preschool orchild care programs, and obtain their commitment prior to submission ofthe application. The model may target child care workers (e.g., day careproviders, preschool providers) in the corporate or private-for-profitsector as well as in the not-for-profit public or private sector. A modelmust be based on a conceptual framework that identifies the existing rolesand responsibilities of the individuals to be trained, the changes requiredin those roles to serve children with handicaps, and the skills neededto implement the new roles. A model must directly train personnel to provide,coordinate, or enhance special education or related services to childrenwith handicaps in integrated community based programs. Inservice trainingprocedures and materials must address the training needs of a variety ofpersonnel. The model must enable the content and procedures to be tailoredto the existing skills and roles of the different trainee groups. In additionto initial training the model must include an array of follow-up and supportactivities that insures that personnel participating in the training masterand implement services to meet the needs of students with handicaps beingserved in settings with nonhandicapped children. During years 2 and 3,the inservice training model must collect data regarding the number ofinfants and toddlers or preschool-aged children with handicaps served inthe target programs and the types of services provided to the children.Projects must also evaluate the inservice training model through directassessment of participant skills following the training and after a periodof time. At least some measures must be based on direct observation inthe service setting using standardized observational rating techniques.Models must be consistent with personnel standards and certification/licensurerequirements in their States. The Secretary especially invites applications from: (a) Local, intermediateeducation agency or State-operated programs that are interested in placingchildren with handicaps in programs for nonhandicapped preschool childrenas a way to integrate handicapped and nonhandicapped children; (b) corporationsor organizations that are interested in expanding current child care servicesto include services for children with handicaps an integrated setting;and (c) institutions or organizations that have collaborative relationshipswith entities described in (a) or (b) above. However, applications thatmeet this invitational priority will not receive a competitive preferenceover other applications for demonstration projects that develop, implement,an evaluate new or improved approaches for serving young children withhandicaps (ages birth through eight). Priority 4. Information Management of Services for Infants and Toddlers.(CFDA No. 84.024) This priority supports demonstration projects to develop or improve andevaluate automated information management systems for tracking, managing,and planning services for young children with handicaps, aged birth throughtwo years of age, and their families within a State or major urban area.The system must (1) separately track and count the children and familieswho receive early intervention services; (2) identify the types and locationof those services provided and/or needed but not provided; (3) identifythe provider and the funding sources (Federal, State, private, or local)for each service provided; (4) alert programs serving preschool-aged childrenof incoming three year old children, at least three months in advance ofthe children's transition from early intervention services to preschoolservices; and (5) use data elements compatible with State or regional childcount systems. Applicants must coordinate the program with the State education agencyand the State agency designated to administer the Program for Infants andToddlers With Handicaps in the States where the information system is tested.The system must be coordinated with any other information systems in theState (e.g., health agency systems for tracking specific medical conditions),that overlap in population tracked, intent or purpose. This may be achieved,for example, by using identifiers compatible with other existing systems,or by merging the existing systems into a single system. Projects funded under this priority must include an evaluation design thatassures that the automated system is operational (<T3>i.e. </T3>produces information and reports that are accurate and consistentwith the system design), that the required information linkages are compatibleand reliable, and that the information produced is useful for trackingand planning purposes by the intended users of the information system.It is anticipated that projects funded under this priority will developthe software, documentation, and users' guides that will allow other interestedagencies to adopt the information system. Users guides must provide asmuch information as possible as to the ways elements of the system canbe adapted to fit the data needs or hardware configurations of other agencies.Priority 5. Nondirected Experimental Projects (CFDA No. 84.024) This priority supports investigations of alternative interventions or approachesfor serving infants, toddlers, or preschool-aged children with handicaps.Interventions selected for comparison must include those for which informationis unavailable regarding their relative effectiveness for particular groupsof children or within particular settings or conditions. Projects supportedunder this priority must: (1) Compare the alternative interventions or approaches in typical servicesettings; (2) Conduct the investigations using methodological procedures that willproduce unambigious findings regarding the relative effectiveness of thealternative strategies as well as any findings as to interaction effectsbetween particular approaches and particular groups of children or particularcontexts; and(3) Include dissemination activities that will lead to improved servicesfor infants, toddlers, or preschool-aged children with handicaps. Projects must (1) address a specific problem or issue; (2) include specificapproaches or interventions that will be compared or validated, includingthe rationale for selecting particular approaches and previous evaluationinformation regarding these approaches; (3) include specific types of childrentargeted by the project (i.e., by age, handicapping condition or diagnosis,level of functioning); and (4) include an evaluation design that includesfunctional outcome measures for the young children with handicaps or theirfamilies who participate in the proposed intervention(s). Final reportssubmitted by projects funded under this priority must include both thespecific findings of the project as well as general principles that havebeen learned or tested for developing interventions for young childrenwith handicaps. Quantifiable information from project evaluation activitiesmust also be included along with precise information regarding the proceduresfor the interventions and the contexts in which they were implemented aswell as available cost information. The Secretary particulary invites applications that compare alternativeapproaches to assessing family strengths and needs as part of the processfor developing the individualized family plans (IFSP) required under PartH of the Education of the Handicapped Act. Such projects could compareapproaches, instruments, or tools commonly used for family assessment acrossdisciplines or within a single discipline to determine their relative effectson the strength and needs identified, on the process for developing theIFSP, on the document itself, and on the satisfaction of participants inthe planning process, including families of infants and toddlers with handicaps.However, applications that meet the invitational priority will not receivea competitive preference over other applicants for projects that investigatealternative interventions or approaches for serving infants, toddlers,or preschool-aged children with handicaps. Priority 6. State or Multi-State Outreach Projects. (CFDA No. 84.024) This priority supports projects that facilitate the implementation in singleor multiple States of proven infant, toddler or early childhood models,or selected components of those models. Projects supported under this prioritymust: (1) Coordinate their dissemination and replication activities with thelead agency for Part H of the Education of the Handicapped Act for earlyintervention services or the State educational agency for special educationand related services; (2) Disseminate and replicate proven models, or components of proven models,that provide services needed to assist young children, aged eight and belowto achieve the children's optimal functioning. Services at a minimum mustcontain the following components: (a) Approaches relevant to programming in regular settings including provisionfor skills necessary to function in integrated educational environments;(b) Team based programming that integrates the delivery of services thatincludes parents, teachers, therapists and other professional disciplines;(c) Effective involvement of families in the planning and delivery of services;and (d) Interagency coordination when multiple agencies are involved in theprovision of services to children; (3) Evaluate the dissemination and replication activities to determinetheir effectiveness including their impact on the provision of servicesto infants, toddlers, and young children with handicaps. The models or components of models must be state-of-the art, providingprocedures and information that are not readily available to program siteswithin States where outreach is planned. The models or components of modelsmust be based on current theory and research, and must have unambigiousevaluation information regarding effectiveness. In addition, the projectshould be consistent with the provisions of Part B or Part H of the Educationof the Handicapped Act. Outreach activities may include, but not be limitedto: public awareness, product development and dissemination, site development,training and technical assistance. The projects may work with major earlychildhood associations, provider groups or agencies in disseminating andreplicating the proven models, or components of proven models. Projects under this priority must (1) include models or components of modelsselected for outreach activities and a rationable as to the importanceof these models; (2) select a model based on unambiguous evidence as toits effectiveness; (3) include specific dissemination and replication activities;and (4) have a rationale for those activities. Final reports submitted by projects funded under this priority must includeevaluation information as to the effectiveness of the model as implementedby replication sites.The Secretary particularly invites applications for outreach projects thatare based on models serving young children with severe disabilities, youngchildren with handicaps due to chronic health problems, or young childrenwith handicapping conditions who have been previously unserved or underserved.However, applications that meet this invitational priority will not receivea competitive preference over other applications for outreach projectsthat serve other young children with handicaps aged birth through eight.Priority 7. Early Childhood Research Institute_Integrated Programs. (CFDANo. 84.024) This priority establishes an Early Childhood Research Institute to develop,field-test, and disseminate intervention strategies to improve the integrationof young children with handicaps into a range of preschool, child-care,pre-kindergarten, and kindergarten programs available to non-handicappedchildren in local communities (whether sponsored by public, private, orcorporate agencies). The goal of the institute is to produce validatedintervention procedures that service can providers use to adapt to on-goingpreschool, child-care, pre-kindergarten, and kindergarten programs to appropriatelymeet the needs of children with a range of handicapping conditions. Theinstitute must conduct a program of research that will: (1) Work with major early childhood associations and provider groups oragencies to identify major approaches, curricula, or models that are commonlyused by preschool, child-care, pre-kindergarten, or kindergarten providersto structure and deliver services for non-handicapped preschool or kindergarten-agedchildren. These approaches may encompass the entire program or particularprogram areas (i.e., language development, practical life skills, etc.),but they must be found in communities throughout the Nation; (2) Identify through analysis of materials and classroom observation theextent to which particular approaches, models, or curricula are compatiblewith the learning characteristics and education/related service needs ofpreschool-aged children with a range of handicapping conditions as wellas program barriers that affect the capacity of the programs to addressthe special needs of children with a range of handicapping conditions.The results of these analyses must be shared and revised through discussionswith major early childhood associations and provider groups or agencies.(3) Develop and test adaptations of particular approaches, models, or curriculato meet the special needs of children with a range of handicapping conditions.In developing and testing adaptations, the institute will work with majorearly childhood associations and provider groups or agencies to (a) selectapproaches, models, or curriculum that are most promising (based on theanalyses of 2 above) for meeting the special needs of children with handicaps;(b) develop adapted activities, materials, curricula, instructional strategies,classroom environments that are compatible with key features of particularapproaches and models, but that are also consistent with the learning characteristicsand special education/related service needs of children with a range ofhandicapping conditions; and, (c) test and evaluate the intervention strategesin multiple sites, employing research designs that assure that the effectivenessof the intervention strategy is determined; (4) Work with major early childhood associations and provider groups andagencies to develop and test materials that would allow public, private,and corporate providers of preschool, child-care, pre-kindergarten, andkindergarten programs for non-handicapped students to adapt their programsto meet the needs of students with a range of handicapping conditions.Materials must be developed that describe adaptations identified in (3)above for particular approaches, models, or curricula. Materials must bedeveloped that outline general principles for providing services for preschool-agedchildren with various handicapping conditions in integrated preschool andkindergarten settings. Inservice and preservice materials for trainingearly childhood personnel to adapt and modify programs to meet the needsof preschool-aged students with handicaps must also be developed and fieldtested; and (5) Provide research training and experience for at least 10 graduate studentseach year. The institute must conduct the program of research and development withina conceptual framework that identifies major approaches and models fordelivering preschool, childcare, pre-kindergarten, and kindergarten servicesto non-handicapped children; the learning characteristic and special education/relatedservice needs of preschool-aged children with a range of handicapping conditions;and program dimensions that impede or facilitate the integration of preschool-agedstudents with handicaps.<T3>Period of Award. </T3>The Secretary will approve one cooperative agreementwith a project period of up to 60 months subject to the requirements of34 CFR 75.253(a) for continuation awards. In determining whether to continuethe institute for the last two years of the project period, in additionto considering the factors in 34 CFR 75.253(a), the Secretary will considerthe recommendation of a review team consisting of three external expertsselected by the Secretary and designated Federal program officials. Theservices of the review team are to be performed during the last half ofthe institute's second year, and will replace that year's annual evaluationthat the recipient is required to perform under 34 CFR 75.590. During allother years of the project, the recipient must comply with 34 CFR 75.590.Costs associated with the services to be performed by the three externalmembers of the review team are to be incorporated into the applicant'sproposed budget. In developing its recommendation, the review team willconsider, among other factors, the following:(1) The timeliness and the effectiveness with which all requirements ofthe negotiated cooperative agreement have been or are being met by therecipient of the cooperative agreement; and(2) The degree to which the institute's research design and methodologicalprocedures demonstrate the potential for producing significant new knowledgeand products.<T3>Priority 8. Early Childhood Research Institute_Intervention (CFDA No.84.024)</T3>This priority will establish an Early Childhood Research Institute to developnew or improved interventions for infants and toddlers with handicaps who,because of the nature of their disabilities, require extended medical carein hospital intensive care units and who may require life-supporting technologiesand systems of health care. The institute's purpose is to conduct a programof research and development designed to produce information and materialsthat can be used in concert with the provision of intensive health careand that promote the developmental progress of these children. The institute'sresearch and development activities must produce information and materialsthat can be used within intensive care units and that facilitate the successfultransition of the child to the home and to community-based services. Theresearch and development activities must consist of two major areas ofinquiry.First, the institute must conduct a program of research to develop newor improved procedures related to the identification, referral, and interventionprocess. The institute's research must include, but need not be limitedto, studies that: (1) Develop exemplary practices related to physicianreferral, initial family counseling, and tracking of the child's progressand services; (2) indentify effective practices and procedures for formingand involving a multidisciplinary team to plan services for the child andfamily; (3) establish criteria for enlisting the services of differentState agencies, including the State Protection and Advocacy agency or otherchild protection groups; (4) develop exemplary models for determining thepoint in the child's life when nonmedical interventions can be appropriatelyand safely implemented; (5) identify a variety of effective nonmedicalinterventions that are keyed to child developmental needs, child medicalneeds, family needs and characteristics, and the potential for deliveringsuch services within a hospital intensive care unit; and (6) develop newor improved interventions that will facilitate the transition of the childto the home and to community-based services. The outcomes of this researchare expected to lead to improved processes of referral, family counseling,and planning and coordinating services.Second, the institute must conduct a program of research to develop newor improved organizational structures related to the identification, referraland intervention process.

Projects must develop working prototypes which use existingtechnology, where possible, and which capitalize on recent technologicaladvances to enhance the teaching or learning of children with handicaps.Projects must include a plan for the formative evaluation of the innovativeadaptations to determine the soundness of the engineering, the adequacyof the design, whether it compensates for the disability, whether it isfeasible to operate and maintain in a school setting, and the feasibilityfor future production and distribution. A final report must include theprototype product as well as a discussion and rationale to support anyneeded and recommended modifications for the prototype based on the formativeevaluation.<T3>Program Authority: </T3>20 U.S.C. 1461.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>These programs are subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372and the regulations in 34 CFR Part 79.
