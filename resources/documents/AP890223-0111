North's trial today that he knewnothing of Reagan administration efforts to obtain aid for theNicaraguan rebels from other countries until after the Iran-Contraaffair became public.   New details of the administration's efforts to solicit assistancefrom foreign nations in return for increased U.S. military andeconomic aid emerged during defense cross-examination of Rep. LeeHamilton, D-Ind.   Defense lawyer Brendan V. Sullivan Jr. asked Hamilton if he knewthat the administration arranged for an Asian nation to sellmissiles to the Contras, asked an Asian country to supplycommunications equipment and obtained aircraft from a CentralAmerican nation to train rebel pilots.   None of these countries was identified, but Hamilton toldSullivan he was not told of these and other administration effortsto solicit the Contra aid while direct U.S. military assistance wasbanned by Congress between 1984 and 1986.   ``My recollection is that my knowledge of the events camesubsequent to the time frame,'' Hamilton said.   The defense is trying to blunt charges that North, a former WhiteHouse aide, lied to Congress about his efforts to assist the Contrasby showing that the Reagan administration didn't tell lawmakersabout its broad efforts to help the rebels by soliciting foreigndonations after Congress shut off U.S. aid in 1984.   Hamilton, the leadoff prosecution witness in the U.S. DistrictCourt trial, was followed to the stand by Adolfo Calero, theAmerican-educated president of the Nicaraguan Freedom Forces, as theContras were known.   Colero said that from the time he joined the organization in1983, ``it was my clear understanding that the effort to regain mycountry was being financially supported by the United Statesgovernment.'' The CIA was understood to be the source of the money.   Calero said the money flow dried up in May 1984, after Congressbanned military aid to the Contras. But he said members of the CIA,accompanied by North, visited him and he gave them an account numberin a Miami bank.   The Contra leader said that beginning in June 1984 and ending inFebruary 1985, $32 million was put into the account, of which therebels spent $17 million or $18 million for lethal weapons.   But sometime in 1985, Calero said, North mentioned the need tohelp American hostages in Lebanon and ``I said I would gladlycontribute money.'' He said he gave North $90,000 in Visa traveler'schecks.   One of the charges against North is that he used at least $4,300of that money for himself.   Calero said he didn't expect that North would spend any of themoney for his personal use. He said North told him he kept adetailed accounting of how he spent the travelers' checks, but ``Inever demanded it of him. I had absolute trust, I was not asking himfor an accounting.''   Hamilton said he didn't know at the time that Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz asked an Asian country to provide communicationsequipment to the Contras because the rebels' devices were antiquated.   He also said he wasn't told that that Shultz and then-nationalsecurity adviser John M. Poindexter knew of a plan by a CentralAmerican nation to provide aircraft to help train Contra fighterpilots.   Sullivan asked if Hamilton was told that Poindexter's predecessoras national security adviser, Robert McFarlane, authorized North tocontact ``a senior military official of an Asian country'' toarrange ``the sale of missiles to the resistance.''   Hamilton said he couldn't recall being told this. He also he wasnot told that Gen. John W. Vessey Jr., then-chairman of the JointChiefs of Staff, also met with the Asian official to arrange thesale.   On re-direct examination, Hamilton insisted that he did not haveto check the denials North and McFarlane made to him of news reportsthe National Security Council staff was helping the Contras indefiance of the congressional ban on such aid.   ``Why did you rely in 1985 to the word of national securityadviser McFarlane?'' asked prosecutor John W. Keker.   ``McFarlane was a top security adviser to the president of theUnited States. Upon whom can I rely if I can't rely on thepresident's top adviser?'' Hamilton replied.   North, a retired Marine lieutenant colonel, is charged with 12felonies arising from the Iran-Contra affair that could result in 60years imprisonment upon conviction.   Among other things, he is accused of obstructing congressionalinquiries into his efforts to raise money for the Nicaraguan rebels.This allegedly included lying at the 1986 meeting and helpingMcFarlane, who has pleaded guilty to withholding information fromCongress, draft false denials in response to congressional inquiries.</TEXT></DOC>
