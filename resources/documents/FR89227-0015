TheFCC noted that under our current rules all of NECA's expenses, includingexpenses related to the preparation of all NECA tariffs and the administrationof the traffic-sensitive (TS) pool, are being recovered from the commonline elements. The FCC also observed that it had authorized NECA to engagein certain activities other than the administration of interstate accesscharges. The <T3>Notice </T3>proposed that NECA divide its expenses into two categories.Category I would include those expenses associated with the preparation,defense, and modification of NECA tariffs, the administration of pooledreceipts and distributions of exchange carrier revenues resulting fromNECA tariffs, and NECA's participation in Commission proceedings involvingSubpart G of Part 69 of the Commission's Rules. Category II would consistof all other NECA expenses. The FCC proposed subdividing Category I expensesinto common line expenses and other expenses. The FCC also proposed torequire the inclusion of data and information on NECA's historical andprojected expenses in its tariff filings. In the <T3>Report and Order</T3>, the FCC adopted its proposed apportionment ofNECA expenses between Category I and Category II with one modification.The FCC included language proposed by NECA in the definition of CategoryI to make it clear that expenses associated with its andSection; 69.603(c)-(g)activities are included in Category I expenses. The FCC found that withoutsuch an apportionment, it is not possible to ensure that NECA does notcross-subsidize its Category II activities with revenues from interstateaccess charges. In reaching this decision, the FCC rejected as too narrowa definition of Category I expenses a proposal of the Bell Atlantic TelephoneCompanies to exclude from Category I any common line expenses other thanthose associated Telephone Company of NECA's carrier common line tarifffilings. The FCC also declined to require that NECA pleadings disclosethat some of its members do not agree with a position it takes when makingCategory I filing, as proposed by the Bell Atlantic Telephone Companies.The FCC found that NECA's administrative burden would be substantiallyincreased if such a proposal were to be adopted. The FCC also adopted rules that apportion Category I expenses among thevarious activities NECA performs under that rubric. In light of the changesto the interstate access charge pooling arrangements and NECA's responsibilitiesin this revised structure, <T3>See generally, MTS and WATS Market Structure and Amendment of Part67 of the Commission's Rules and Establishment of a Joint Board</T3>, 2FCC Rcd 2953 (1987), <T3>aff'd on recon.</T3>, 3 FCC Rcd 4543 (1988), <T3>appeal pending sub nom. </T3>Public Service Commission of the Districtof Columbia v. FCC, No. 88-1661 (D.C. Cir. filed Sept. 12, 1988), the FCCconcluded that NECA's proposal for three subcategories was more consistentwith NECA's new duties than the FCC's original proposal. The rules adoptedapportion NECA's Category I expenses among three components in proportionto the revenues associated with each component. The components reflectNECA's activities with respect to the Universal Service Fund and LifelineAssistance programs; NECA common line tariffs, Long Term Support, and TransitionalSupport; and all other NECA pool tariffs, including its ``Common Termsand Conditions'' tariff. These rules essentially retain the FCC proposal,but divide the proposed common line subcategory into two parts_one forexpenses ralating to NECA's administration of the Universal Service Fundand Lifeline Assistance programs and the other for the costs of administeringNECA's common line pool and the common line support flows. The FCC foundthat the apportioned administrative expenses will be recovered as partof the revenue requirement for the activities associated with each subcategory,which is consistent with the goal to better tailor the apportionment ofNECA's expenses to the activities for which they are incurred. The FCCalso concluded that disaggregation of expenses based on the proportionof revenues from each category is an administratively simple approach thatwill result in fair apportionments without imposing significant additionaladministrative expenses on NECA. The FCC rejected an ALLTEL Corporationproposal that NECA be required to create a separate category under CategoryI expenses for the expenses of administering the TS pool and that thesecosts should continue to be part of the revenue requirement for Associationtariffs filed pursuant to andSection;andSection; 69.4(a) and (b)(2) (the CCLrate element) finding that it would be inconsistent with its goal thatthese costs be apportioned in a manner that associates the costs with thebeneficiaries of the expense.Finally, the FCC adopted a rule requiring NECA to file certain data andinformation relating to its administrative expenses with its annual tarifffiling to permit the FCC to review NECA's expenses and to enable interestedpersons to comment on NECA's administrative expenses. The FCC did not specifytime periods for the NECA administrative expense data, noting that in theabsence of contrary instructions, administrative expense data should beconsistent with other cost support data that is filed with a particularaccess tariff filing. The FCC certified that the requirements contained in the Regulatory FlexibilityAct, 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq., </T3>are not applicable to the rules adopted in this proceeding.<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction </ITAG>The proposal contained herein has been analyzed with respect to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 and found to contain no new or modified form, informationcollection and/or recordkeeping, labelling, disclosure, or record retentionrequirements; and will not increase or decrease burden hours imposed onthe public. <ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clauses </ITAG>Accordingly, <T3>it is ordered, </T3>Pursuant to sections 1, 4 (i)-(j), 201-202, 205,and 403 of the Communications Act of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 151, 154(i)-(j), 201-202, 205, and 403, that Part 69 of the Commission's rulesis amended as set forth below.
