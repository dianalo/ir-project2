Their statements came amid indications that Syria may beauthorized by Iran and Hezbollah, Tehran's main ally in Lebanon, tonegotiate the release of U.S. hostage Joseph Cicippio and 15 othersheld in Lebanon.   In Iran, the English-language Tehran Times said Tehran would bewilling to use its influence in the hostage crisis if the UnitedStates agreed to release billions of dollars of Iranian assets longfrozen in New York banks.   They also came as as signs appeared of a rift in Iran's newleadership over the hostage issue, pitting hard-line InteriorMinister Ali Akbar Mohtashemi against pragmatist President HashemiRafsanjani.   In a statement distributed in Beirut, Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, asenior Hezbollah leader said, ``There shall be no contacts and nonegotiations as long as Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid remains incaptivity.''   ``This is the party's unshakeable conviction and this is what weshall do,'' Tofaili said, adding, ``Hezbollah is not concerned withthe question of the hostages or the negotiations revolving aroundit.''   The hostage crisis was triggered when Israeli commandoskidnapped Obeid, 33, from his home in south Lebanon July 28 andwhisked him to Israel.   Israel has offered to trade Obeid and all 450 Shiite prisonersit holds for the three Israelis and the Western hostages held inLebanon but Hezbollah insists the cleric should be unconditionallyfreed.   Hezbollah's spiritual guide, Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah,said in a separate statement published by several Beirut newspapersthat Obeid's abduction left ``the region poised on a powder keg.''   ``That act of piracy led to the killing of the American officerHiggins,'' Fadlallah said, referring to the announcement nine daysago by the underground Organization of the Oppressed on Earth thatit hanged U.S. Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.   Fadlallah said Israel's refusal to free Obeid and movements ofU.S. warships in the eastern Mediterranean after Higgins' deathreminded him of tensions that preceded Israel's 1982 invasion ofLebanon.   ``I do not rule out the possibility of a large-scale militaryoperation by Israel to get itself off the hook in this crisis whichit created,'' Fadlallah said.   But the independent newspaper An-Nahar said today there wereindications Syria and Iran would ``coordinate and intensify effortsto resolve the hostage issue and defuse the crisis.''   ``This is expected to take its final shape when Iranian ForeignMinister Ali Akbar Velayati arrives in Syria soon for talks withPresident Hafez Assad's government,'' An-Nahar said in a reportfrom its Damascus correspondent.   Syria was Iran's main ally in the 8-year gulf war against Iraq,which ended in a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire last August.   An-Nida, the organ of the pro-Moscow Lebanese Communist Party,quoted unnamed travelers from the Syrian capital as saying thegovernment ``may have been authorized by Iran and Hezbollah tonegotiate the release of the Western hostages.'' It did notelaborate.   Higgins, who commanded the U.N. peacekeeping force, waskidnapped near Tyre in south Lebanon on Feb. 17, 1988.   Longest held of the U.S. hostages is Terry A. Anderson, chief APMiddle East correspondent. He was kidnapped nearly 4{ years ago.   President Bush on Monday paid tribute to Higgins during aceremony at Ft. Myer, Va., to celebrate the 200th anniversary ofthe War Department, forerunner of the Department of Defense.   In an emotion-filled voice, Bush said, ``We cannot leave heretoday without pausing to salute one who stands as the symbol of thecourage that burns in the breast of every American in uniform, oneMarine who has been very much in our thoughts, Lt. Col. Higgins,William Richard Higgins.''   The videotape released last week in Beirut depicted a bound andgagged man hanging from a rope around his neck.   Israeli government officials have said their sources indicatedHiggins had been killed some time ago. Higgins was the target ofpast death threats by the terrorists, who called him a spy.   An-Nahar said Syria was among countries requested by Bush tointervene after another extremist group threatened to kill Cicippioin retaliation for Obeid's abduction.   Cicippio, 58, was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986, from the AmericanUniversity of Beirut where he worked as acting comptroller.   The Revolutionary Justice Organization, which claims to beholding Cicippio, has asked Syria to negotiate its offer throughinternational organizations.   Damascus has made no public response and Israel rejected theoffer.   Syria is Lebanon's main power broker, with 40,000 troopsstationed there under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. Theycontrol Hezbollah's strongholds in Beirut's southern slums and eastLebanon's Bekaa valley.   The Tehran Times quoted a source close to Rafsanjani as saying``the first step should be taken by the U.S. and if Tehran getssatisfied that its assets will certainly be unfrozen, then thesecond step will definitely come from Iran.''   Washington froze more than $2 billion in Iranian assets after itbroke diplomatic relations with Tehran over the seizure of the U.S.Embassy there in 1979.   Rafsanjani offered last week to help Washington resolve thehostage problem.   But Mohtashemi appeared to challenge him in a speech Sundaynight at the grave of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Hisspeech, broadcast Monday by Tehran radio, said there are ``manyHezbollah cells around the world created by the holy breath of theImam Khomeini that cry death to the superpowers.''</TEXT></DOC>
