The decision was announced by U.S. Trade Representative CarlaHills, who acted after a five-month investigation required under the1988 Trade Act.   The law requires the United States to open negotiations withcountries deemed by U.S. trade officials to be blocking sales byAmerican firms of telecommunications equipment.   If the talks don't succeed in removing trade barriers within ayear, the law requires the administration to impose trade sanctions.However, the administration has the option of extending the talksfor as long as two more years if U.S. officials believe thatprogress is being made.   The announcement said the decision was made by Mrs. Hills afterreviewing comments from industry, labor, other federal agencies,members of Congress and foreign governments.   ``Criteria for the examination included not only trade barriers,but also each nation's market potential and any measurable progressthat it might be making toward (trade) liberalization,'' the tradeoffice said in a statement.</TEXT></DOC>
