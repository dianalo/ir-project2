(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Just when you thought you understood the difference between SAA and NAS,along comes another architecture-CA90s.andP;  Like the blueprints from IBM andDigital, this one from Computer Associates offers more promises thanproducts.andM;The most surprising aspect of Computer Associates International Inc.'sambitious plans to link its most significant systems software productstogether is that users think the company can do it-that the Garden City,N.Y.-based firm can see CA90s, as the plans are known, through to completion.andM;Not that users forget CA achieved its $1.3 billion size by buying-notdeveloping-most of the 290 products on its roster from an assortment ofacquired companies.andP;  Not that users believe CA has any better chance ofrealizing its architectural dreams than considerably bigger companies-notably$63 billion IBM with its Systems Application Architecture (SAA) and $13billion Digital Equipment Corp. through its Network Applications Support(NAS) architecture.andP;  Not that users are entirely happy with the progress  orlack of it) that CA is making on the applications software front.andP;  But usersdo seem convinced that CA chairman Charles Wang's vision of his company inthis decade isn't so farfetched.andM;&quot;The main thing is the attitude change,&quot; a former critic, James Kinder, saysof Computer Associates' executives.andP;  &quot;They've never taken us into theirconfidence in this way before,&quot; confides Kinder, database  administrator  forAutomatic Data Processing Inc., of briefings he and other users have receivedon CA90s.andM;Formally introduced to the world in April, CA90s is a catchall phrase used todescribe a structured design that attempts to create common interfaces andshared services for Computer Associates' vast array of acquired and homespunproducts.andP;  It's the company's boldest attempt to create software independentof hardware and operating systems.andP;  The move, if successful, would benefit CAin a number of ways-reducing its own product development costs speedingproduct delivery and potentially spurring multiple product sales to customerscurrently guying only one product.andM;CA90s also is a technical  framework in which these products can evolve andnew products can be added during the 1990s, either through acquisitions orinternal development This is no small task, as IBM is finding as it attemptsto build SAA or as Digital is discovering in its NAS efforts.andP;  CA90s does notreplace the architectures of such hardware suppliers.andP;  Rather, it's intendedto work with them.andM;What makes the task particularly arduous for CA is that its ballooningproduct portfolio already has some 296-products in it.andP;  They encompass nearlyevery areas of business software and, as such, support more than 30 operatingsystems and a lengthy and growing list of hardware types stretching fromsupercomputers to desktop devices.andP;  Moreover, much 6f this softwaretechnology has been acquired and, thus, has been authored by programmers withwidely differing styles.andP;  The challenge, however, may not be so daunting,believe some CA customers.andM;Many people don't realize that CA90s is not an architecture, at least not inthe accepted sense,&quot; says George Emmanuel, management information systemsprogram manager for Hughes Aircraft Co.'s Training Support Systems Group inLos Angeles.andP;  &quot;It's not an engineering blueprint that has to be fleshed outfrom the ground up, like IBM's or Digital's,&quot; he explains.andP;  &quot;It's more acollection of interfaces that link together largely acquired technologies.&quot;andM;Imagine that CA was in the car business, Emmanuel suggests.andP;  Further imaginethat its car didn't have the turbo engine that customers wanted.andP;  Rather thaninventing the turbo, CA buys a car maker that has one and retrofits it to itsown model.andP;  &quot;It's much easier to be in the pipes and connections businessthan it is to invent things,&quot; the Hughes manager says.andM;Furthermore, CA isn't even creating the pipes and connections-that is,separate software interfaces-between each of its 290 products, as somebelieve.andP;  The company instead is setting up software intermediaries, whichact much like telephone switches.andP;  In an office with 290 telephones, forexample, each phone is not separately hardwired to every other phone in theoffice.andP;  Instead, each phone has a line to an intermediary, a telephoneswitching mechanism which lets each phone communicate with the other 289.andM;The Role of intermediariesandM;CA90s incorporates a number of such intermediaries, known as services orcommon interfaces in Computer Associates' parlance.andP;  The reason that some ofCA's customers are convinced that  it can deliver on CA90s is that a greatnumber of these intermediaries already exist.andP;  But until now CA hasn't talkedabout them.andM;&quot;Some have been around for years,&quot; says Dale Driver, manager of softwareintegration at Brock Telecom Ltd., Brockville, Ontario, Canada.andP;  As a user ofCA products like its IDMS database software, its CA-CAS suite ofmanufacturing resource planning programs plus assorted data center utilities,Brock is no stranger to the task of trying to tie together a potpourri ofdissimilar technologies.andP;  Without these integrators, the company's developerswould have gong insane trying to absorb all that acquired technology,&quot; hesays.andP;  &quot;And the company would have been unable to contain its Randamp;D spending.&quot;andM;The most important intermediary of all, perhaps, was publicly unveiled inApril and dub  ed the Even't Notification Ficility (ENF).andP;  t's not a separateproduct, rather a capability bundled into many of the products that CA sells.andM;ENF, moreover, is not new.andP;  The software has been used by CA developers sincethe late 1970s, albeit in earlier cruder forms.andP;  The idea behind ENF is tocreate a single shared intermediary for all of CA's System ManagementSoftware (sms) products-those specifically aimed at data centers.andP;  Theseinclude such programs as storage and resource management; automatedproduction control; and software for data center administration, performancemanagement and accounting, security, and auditing.andM;Here's how ENF works: if a critical event-for example, a productionbreakdown-occurs in a data center equipped with ENF-based software, theintermediary immediately notifies all participating systems managementsoftware affected by the crisis.andP;  These applications can then take theappropriate' predefined action, such as an automatic restart and recovery,without human intervention.andM;ENF development has always had top priority inside CA because sms productsare the roots of the company.andP;  They bring in over 65% of the company's totalrevenue, according to the Stamford, Conn.-based market research firm GartnerGroup Inc.andM;The company is also intent on creating a super integrator intermediary forits Information Management Software  (ims) business.andP;  Mostly the result ofCA's acquisition of two database software companies, Applied Data Researchand Cullinet Software Inc., IMS now generates 20 to 25% of the company'ssates revenue.andP;  CA sees its data repository, due out this fall, as animportant first step in creating an IMS intermediary.andM;The repository is a fancy name for a data dictionary directory.andP;  The generalconsensus among database experts is that CA has acquired two of the best datadictionaries in the industry, ADR's Data Dictionary and Cullinet's IntegratedData Dictionary.andP;  Both tools are used by clients to create an application andthen manage and maintain it once created.andP;  Both currently work in IBM andDigital environments.andP;  CA intends that its repository will use both of thesedata dictionaries, as well as one expected this fall from IBM for use withBig Blue's DB2 relational database.andM;The third leg of CA's business, Business Applications Software (BAS),contributes the rest, some 10 to 15%, of its $1.3 billion in annual revenue,and is relatively embryonic at this point.andM;The CA90s strategy is to link ENF with its repository and then link both toother services intermediaries.andP;  Once that's accomplished, the whole ensemblecould be made available to applications.andP;  in this way, CA could link togetherthe three levels of its business.andM;Users, too, stand to benefit from such linkage.andP;  With intermediaries, usersmay be able to cut their own software development costs by employing lessexpensive Platforms than mainframes, such as personal computers andworkstations, for such development work.andP;  For example, intermediarycapabilities oil CA's IDMS product would allow users to create software atopthe database using PCs instead of big IBM iron.andM;ENF is Enough?andM;&quot;This is the promise,&quot; says Michael Braude, a Gartner Group analyst.andP;  &quot;Butit's not what CA actually has today.andP;  &quot; What he does see in ComputerAssociates' possession is something he cal s a blue-collararchitecture-software  productsandM;for technical management in data centers.andP;  &quot;ENF is real, and these are thecustomers [data centers users] that CA knows best.&quot; Braude is contrastingsuch data-center-oriented products with white-collar architecture, which isone made of information management and applications software products aimedat end users: business professionals, power users, etc.andM;ENF may be real, but the notion of a link between ENF and IMS products isoverblown in Braude's eyes.andP;  &quot;It's what I call 'marketecture,' &quot; the Gartneranalyst says.andP;  He sees IMS products as a separate subarchitecture, a viewshared by others.andP;  &quot;CA's major focus is on the cluster of products at the smslevel,&quot; says Shaku Atre, a partner at Atre/Computer Assistance in Rye, N.Y.,andO;a consulting division of Coopers andamp; Lybrand.andP;  &quot;That's where the big-spendingcustomers are, and that's where CA is putting its development resource rightnow.&quot;andM;System management software is the only thing CA really understands, argueother consultants and some CA customers.andP;  They assert that CA's developerslook at everything as if it were a tape management system.andM;But there are also former critics who feel that CA has made big strides inunderstanding the information management side.andP;  They even see this knowledgereflected in products that are being shipped today.andP;  Look at CA's Netman SMSproduct, says excritic Kinder at ADP.andP;  Netman software provides data centerswith help-desk and change-management services.andP;  Formerly, Netman only ran onIBM's old Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM) flat file database managementsystem.andP;  It now runs under CA's Datacom-DB, a relational database from theims side of CA's business, which is how Kinder intends to use it.andP;  &quot;They'relearning fast,&quot; he says of CA's executives and developers.andP;  Equallycomplimentary are customers currently beta testing version 2.0 of the CA'sMasterpiece financial and accounting software.andP;  A product of the BusinessApplications side, Masterpiece also now runs under Datacom-DB.andM;But even happy Masterpiece customers and critics-turned-fans, like Kinder,are eager to hear less marketing hype and more technical details.andP;  Bysummer's end, they may be satisfied.andP;  During a blitz of CA user groupmeetings throughout the summer, each of the company's business groups-SystemsManagement, Information Management and Business Applications-is making itsown announcements about CA90s.andM;During these user group gatherings, no doubt, there will be much talk of suchshared services products as CA-IN-FOPOINT.andP;  This product enables 2 5 of thecompany's banking application! to share a common security point, rather thaneach having its own.andP;  CA-EARL also will come up in conversation.andP;  This commoninterface service allows data center personnel to use the same report writeracross such widely differing products as job schedulers and securitypackages.andP;  These follow in the tradition of such established offerings asCA-ACTIVATOR, which provides a common services methodology for installing andrunning software packages in data centers.andP;  Such developments have convincedGlinda Cummings, manager of data security at NCNB Texas National Bank, alarge banking concern in Dallas, that Computer Associates has the technicalexpertise to deliver CA90S.andP;  &quot;My top secret security package can already talkto the likes of tape managers and job schedulers.andP;  It will soon be able totalk to some of our banking and financial applications,&quot; she reveals.andO;Cummings is equally confident that CA will be able to integrate ENF with itsIms products, specifically its database and repository.andM;What Else CA90s Has Going for itandM;It's not just the existence of these many integrators that makes CA90s aviable proposition for the likes of Cummings.andP;  There are three other factors:5 Money.andP;  CA this year is expected to spend $190 million on research anddevelopment-a sum that exceeds the total revenues of such independentsoftware providers as Cincinnati-based Cincom Systems Inc. or Computer Corp.andO;of America.andP;  Much of this money is being poured into CA90s.andP;  ComputerAssociates last year allocated $176 million on Randamp;D.andP;  2 Development savvy.andO;CA'S philosophy of using small  typically four- or five-member) developmentteams wins praise as a source of timely innovation.andP;  This is the onlyeffective way to create software,&quot; says Paul Hessinger, chief technologyofficer for Computer Task Group Inc. The Buffalo, N.Y.-based professionalservices firm has frequently consulted with CA on itS CA90s plans.andP;  &quot;Much ofthe industry's best-selling software was created by small, dedicated groups,&quot;Hessinger observes.andM;IBM.andP;  The gargantuan computer maker's aggressive softwarestrategies-especially its drive to make DB2 the industry's relational DBMSstandard-has led a number of other software makers into CA's acquisitivearms.andP;  The most select technologies from these investments are now helping tobuild CA90s.andP;  &quot;We now begin to see that CA's acquisitions weren't haphazard,but were part of a pattern,&quot; observes Hughes Aircraft's Emmanuel.andP;  &quot;There wasmethod in what they did.&quot;andM;IBM is helping CA in other ways.andP;  One is by inventing interfaces of its ownthat become de facto standards such as Structured Query Language  SQL), thedata manipulation standard for most relational databases.andP;  &quot;IBM and the otherstandards makers in the osi (Open Systems Interconnect) and open systemsarenas are simplifying our task considerably,&quot; says Sanjay Kumar, senior vicepresident planning at Computer Associates.andP;  &quot;They provide us with buildingblocks we don't have to invent.&quot;andM;Another way Big Blue helps CA's cause arises from IBM's relationship withother independent software vendors.andP;  IBM only likes to work with an exclusivecircle of partners.andP;  That leaves many other small software firms without apowerful mentor, a role CA is happy to fill for the right product andcustomer base should such vendors get into trouble.andP;  Will CA's Focus NarrowToo Much?andM;Computer Associates itself could get into trouble with CA90s if thearchitecture causes the company to become so internally focused that it losestouch with its customers.andP;  This is the danger that Charles Wang told meabout,&quot; says Computer Task Group's Hessinger.andP;  &quot;He says he must make surethat his company [doesn't] lose their street-fighting sales instinct.&quot;andM;Wang's concern is warranted.andP;  Some of the users of CA's applications productsare clearly frustrated by the lack of attention paid to such software.andP;  Fromour end, CA only seems to be interested in systems software, notapplications,&quot; says Steve Morris, supervisor of general ledger operations forPortland General Electric Co., an investor-owned utility in Portland, Ore.andO;&quot;Until CA gives me a product with the features and functions I want, it givesme nothing,&quot; he adds, citing long-awaited enhancements to Masterpiece as asource of his frustration.andP;  Version 3.0 of the product is due out next year.andM;Dave Tilley says he has waited four years and will eventually wait five toget the features and functions he needs for his general ledger application.andO;The supervisor of accounting systems at Canadian energy giant Nova Corp. OfAlberta in Calgary wishes it were otherwise.andP;  &quot;There is no parity betweensystems software and applications within CA,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;Applications are apoor second.&quot;andM;CA's Kumar counters such criticism by claiming that chief informationofficers-the top is dog in many user organizations-are the ones pressing CAto emphasize its architecture over applications.andP;  &quot;They want to be able toplan ahead,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;But it's not a case of us having a systems softwaremind-set or doing CA90s instead of applications.andP;  We're doing both andattempting to strike a balance.andM;The balance of the 1990s will tell whether or not CA90s achieves itsobjectives.andM;The Building Layers of CA90s Key to achieving hardware independence via CA90sare three kinds of intermediaries, or services, offered by CA.andM;USER INTERFACE SERVICESandM;Give ail CA's software the same look and feel.andP;  As such, these services makeend users comfortable by providing the same screens, help facilities,reporting, graphics, voice capabilities, etc.andP;  from application toapplication.andP;  For example, the company's CA-INFOPOINT banking software familyhas standard screens and report writers across all 25 members.andM;INTEGRATION SERVICESandM;Insulate software from platform (hardware and operating system) dependencies.andO;Support the overall integration of CA's software products.andP;  ENF is pivotal inthe Systems Management area and to the data repository in the informationManagement area.andM;DISTRIBUTED DATA-PROCESSING SERVICESandM;Achieve distributed processing across the widest number of platformspossible.andP;  CA users, for example, currently employ over 30 operating systems,including IBM's MVS, VSE and VM for their mainframe systems; IBM's OS/400operating system for their AS/400 midrange machines; and DOS and OS/2operating systems on their desktop systems.andP;  Outside the Big Blue world, CAusers have the Digital VMS operating system on their VAX workstations andmidrange computers, as well as operating systems for a host of other hardwareofferings stretching from Japanese plug compatible mainframes to Apple'sMacintosh.andP;  These technology and communications facilities are the leastevolved of any of CA's services.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
