On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the May contract for WestTexas Intemediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, settled at $17.03 perbarrel Friday. That was 7 cents higher than Thursday's close.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, the Aprilcontract for wholesale heating oil rose 0.38 cent to 47.78 centsper gallon, after slipping 0.33 cent Thursday. Unleaded gasoline,up 0.08 cent Thursday, rose 0.61 cent to 47.94 cents a gallon.   Traders attributed the increase to speculation that thefive-member pricing committee of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries would take substantive action to stabilizeprices when it meets the first week in April.   OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman had announced plans to hold themeeting earlier this week. Analysts, though, expressed doubts overwhether anything would be accomplished prior to the cartel'sregular meeting in June.   Still,``the marketplace is telling us it's afraid of selling,''explained Madison Galbraith, a senior trader with Merrill LynchEnergy Futures. ``There was very strong trade buying.''   Oil prices have fallen recently amid allegations that the OPECmember states were cheating on production levels as well as pricingrules.</TEXT></DOC>
