Beware.    This year, the Labor Department has repeatedly issued reports on the sluggish growth of the nation's employment -- only to say &quot;never mind&quot; within a month. In April, the growth in new jobs was estimated at a mere 117,000; after the statistics mills had gathered more information, however, the figure was nearly doubled to 206,000. Similarly, the May total was raised from 101,000 initially to 207,000, and June's from 180,000 to 250,000.    There's more. While Wall Street bet billions, while the Federal Reserve set policy and while corporate boards examined their buying and borrowing plans, the government revised so many statistics so significantly that the forecasts of many economists flipped in only a few weeks.    It turns out, for instance, that retail sales, which account for a third of the nation's economic activity, didn't decline in May as the government earlier reported. They grew -- at a healthy rate. And in June, new orders for big-ticket items such as cars rose 1.4% instead of creeping up at the anemic 0.3% rate reported previously.    The spate of revisions &quot;almost makes a mockery out of trying to interpret what's going on,&quot; says Gary Ciminero, the chief economist at Fleet/Norstar Financial Group in Providence, R.I.    All of this confusion culminated Tuesday in a new report on the bottom-line performance of the economy, the nation's total output of goods and services. The annual rate of growth in gross national product was revised upward a full percentage point, to 2.7% from 1.7%. The second-quarter makeover spelled the difference between an economy that some experts thought on the brink of recession and one capable of meeting the Bush administration's rosy 1989 growth forecast -- a prognosis derided as shamefully unrealistic only weeks ago.    Many government officials and private economists see the foundation of economic policy and business planning at stake. &quot;The quality of statistics as a whole is a serious problem,&quot; says Michael Boskin, Mr. Bush's chief economic adviser. &quot;We make everything from budget policy to trade policy to monetary policy based on these numbers.&quot;    The statistics concern rank-and-file citizens as well as economists. Half the U.S. population live in a household where someone's income is affected by the consumer price index. Some federal grants for community projects are tied to regional unemployment rates. The Labor Department's earnings data are used to index hundreds of billions of dollars of defense contracts.    The Labor Department dislikes the epidemic of big revisions. &quot;I certainly hope it doesn't continue,&quot; says Janet Norwood, the commissioner of labor statistics. &quot;It's not unusual from time to time to have a revision as we've had for the past few months, but if it continued over a very long period, it would be a real cause for concern.&quot;    Does she know why the revisions are so wide? &quot;I really do not,&quot; she says.    Private economists and some government officials offer some theories. The recent run of big revisions at this critical stage in the business cycle, they suggest, may stem partly from shifts in the economy and from growing difficulties in collecting information.    Consider the plight of one analyst who helps compile statistics at the Census Bureau, which puts out many of the government's monthly economic reports. Dozens of the nation's large companies have stopped completing the monthly surveys that the department uses for vital information on orders and sales. Many of the companies were taken over, and their new managers are obsessed with cutting costs. &quot;One of the first things they do is stop filling out our reports because they're voluntary,&quot; the Census official says. &quot;What that does is make our statistics less reliable.&quot;    Mr. Boskin notes that deregulation of many American industries in the 1970s and 1980s obliterated the reporting of reams of information to regulatory agencies. Import figures are harder to come by as well. &quot;As we've progressively reduced tariffs, all the data that came in with them are much less available,&quot; he adds.    And, of course, statistical agencies, like virtually every office in the government, have been squeezed in the federal budget crunch. Some officials complain that the widening gap between government and private salaries has made it difficult to attract top-notch Ph.D. economists to analyze the data -- and every statistic involves some degree of judgment and analysis beyond merely crunching numbers.    In some cases, even where budgets have increased, &quot;our requirements have gone up much more than budget has,&quot; notes Commissioner of Labor Statistics Norwood. One example: In calculating the consumer price index, the chief meter of inflation, government analysts price telephones. A few years ago, that meant simply calling American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Since the ATandamp;T breakup, she says, &quot;We have to do lot more.&quot;    In fact, as the economy grows more complex, it also gets harder to measure by current methods. Although Mr. Boskin believes that U.S. economic statistics are among the best in the world, he sees &quot;a lot of room for improvement. . . . To keep the same quality of inputs, we're going to have to continually make improvements because of changes in the economy.&quot;    For instance, how does the government calculate output in the service sector, which now employs seven of every 10 American workers? Getting it right is critical for gauging the GNP. &quot;In the service sector, there are some difficult conceptual problems,&quot; Mr. Boskin says. &quot;Do you just add up the numbers of software programs?&quot; He notes, &quot;You can't just add them together like tons of steel.&quot;    Despite the widespread unhappiness about the state of the stats, some economists say nothing has changed very much. They contend that if the economy weren't at such a vulnerable stage, the extent of the revisions wouldn't be such a big deal. In the interest of getting numbers out early, the government always releases them before all the data are in hand; the late-arriving information inevitably causes some adjustment. &quot;Revisions have been a fact of life as long as we have had government statistics,&quot; says Robert Ortner, who was undersecretary of commerce during the Reagan administration.    For the most part, the government is frank about the shortcomings of its economic numbers, issuing them with warning labels printed plainly on the front of most reports. One widely reported series of statistics, which measures the monthly change in sales of new homes, reported a huge 5.5% increase in June. But in the fine print, the authors of the report cautioned that the margin of error was so great -- plus or minus nine percentage points -- that it was actually &quot;unclear whether there was an increase or decrease.&quot; Indeed, a revision issued this week said there hadn't been any increase in June at all.    &quot;You can't blame the people who put {the statistics} out,&quot; says Robert Dederick, the chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago and a former Commerce Department official. &quot;They warn of sampling errors. It's people like me who ignore this and give the instant analysis. We all have that tendency to disregard the fine print.&quot;    This hunger for instant, down-to-the-decimal numbers helps set the stage for sizable revisions. &quot;There is a need and a desire to have estimates as soon as possible, both for business's own planning and government policy making,&quot; says Mr. Ortner. &quot;There are trade-offs between accuracy and timeliness.&quot;    In the interest of accuracy, Mr. Ortner, while at the Commerce Department, proposed abolishing the monthly report on factory orders for durable goods because another report, issued just over a week later, contained the same information -- and it was based on more complete data.    He took his idea to Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. Mr. Ortner says Mr. Greenspan, a well-known number junkie, shot it down. &quot;He was willing to live with some of the problems in the data just to have information as early as possible to do the very best job he could do in adjusting monetary policy,&quot; Mr. Ortner says. &quot;But for most purposes and most people, I think we would be better served if we could have made that change.&quot;    Lyle Gramley, a former Fed governor, insists that the central bank is perfectly capable of applying sound judgment to economic statistics. &quot;The Fed has a lot of sophistication in this area,&quot; he says. &quot;It doesn't jump to conclusions.&quot;    But this summer's topsy-turvy statistics clearly helped to shape -- or misshape -- Fed policy. In June, for instance, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed's policy-making panel, decided to ease credit because of &quot;indications of a slower economic expansion continue to accumulate,&quot; according to public records of the Fed. Some of these very indicators, however, were later revised significantly.    The Fed subsequently eased again in the final week of July, days after the government initially estimated GNP growth at a meager 1.7% rate in the second quarter. This week's revision, to 2.7%, puts growth higher than even the Fed's own targets.    While the Fed and the financial markets scrutinize the latest economic data, people such as Martin Zimmerman, the chief economist at Ford Motor Co., use the numbers to formulate long-term forecasts that guide the auto maker's major business decisions. Mr. Zimmerman says the revisions so far have helped confirm a view he held all along -- that the economy was slowing, but not to the point of a recession. But he notes: &quot;In theory, you're trying to find out what the future is going to be like. That's difficult when the past keeps changing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
