Witnesses said two people were injured in the attack which brokeout shortly before noon. Seven attackers were arrested.   U.S. Embassy officials said the bombs didn't damage thebuildings and no Americans were hurt.   Witnesses said students, some of them armed with steel bars,hurled six homemade bombs at police and over the embassy wallstopped with barbed wires.   Four of the devices, made from crude chemical explosives packedin soft drink cans, exploded with big bangs, sending about 100people waiting for visa applications running for cover, witnessessaid.   A police officer was hospitalized with blast wounds on his neckand hands, they said. A student was also injured when he was hit bya policeman armed with an iron bar.   Five students carrying one South Korean and two U.S. flagsclimbed over the 6-foot-high fence and ran around the embassycompound for several minutes, scattering leaflets.   One student draped a South Korean national flag over hisshoulder while other students tried to destroy two U.S. flagsbefore being overpowered by police, the witnesses said.   The students also tried to unfurl a placard which read, ``Driveout America, culprit of the Kwangju massacre,'' they said.   The placard refered to an anti-government uprising in Kwangju onMay 18, 1980, during which hundreds were killed. Friday's protestsand others earlier this week were called to commemorate thebloodshed in that southern city.   In Washington, State Department spokesman Charles E. Redman saidthe embassy incident lasted only about five minutes. Redman saidfive policemen and one student were injured.   He added, ``There's no excuse for this kind of behavior. Thereis a political system now in Korea that provides for the expressionof political views and participation in the political process.''   National police remained on full alert to cope with thedemonstrations.   Radical groups called for another march in Seoul on Saturday todenounce the government. Opposition church groups also called forpeaceful protests.   In other parts of Seoul and two provincial cities, hundreds ofstudents staged demonstrations and marches, demanding the fall ofthe government of President Roh Tae-woo and the withdrawal of41,000 U.S. troops stationed here under a mutual defense treaty.   Many of the protests were peaceful but some turned into battleswith riot police who retaliated with tear gas. In Kwangju, 400students clashed with police, hurling firebombs and rocks.   Eight students were arrested in Suwon, 25 miles south of Seoul,when they stormed an office of the governing Democratic JusticeParty with firebombs and sticks. Riot police overpowered theattackers.   Protesters have denounced the United States in demonstrationsthis week, charging that Washington supports military dictatorshipin South Korea.   Demonstrators broke windows and hurled firebombs Thursday at theSeoul office of the U.S. Information Service. The center was seizedby radicals in February who exploded several bombs that causedminor damage.   Radical groups call for the overthrow of the Roh governmentwhich they consider a continuation of its predecessor ``militarydictatorship'' led by former President Chun Doo-hwan.   Roh is distrusted by many Koreans because of the role he playedin Chun's government. Roh narrowly won presidential elections inDecember after two opposition candidates ran and split theopposition ticket.   On Friday, Roh's government and the opposition failed to break astalemate over clearing the way for talks between the president andopposition leaders.   Both sides have called for negotiations between the two campsafter last month's legislative elections in which the oppositiontook control of the National Assembly.   Officials of the rival parties have met several times during thepast week, but failed to work out details on opening the assembly.   One major stumbling block has been Roh's plan to include thehead of his Democratic Justice Party in the summit with KimDae-jung and the two other main opposition party leaders, KimYoung-sam and Kim Jong-pil.   The opposition leaders want only Roh to meet with the oppositionchiefs.   Chun used to include the chairman of his ruling party insummits, but opposition leaders, emboldened by their electionvictory last month, now object to the idea.</TEXT></DOC>
