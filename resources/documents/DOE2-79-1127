Regulatory agenciesmust deal with a complex matrix of emerging scientific information, adiversity of potential risk situations, and a variety of statutory prescriptionsfor protecting public health. Seven policy principles are proposed forfacilitating integration of the latest scientific thought into the administrativedecision-making process. The principles relate to distinguishing betweenrisk assessment and risk management, analysis of all relevant informationin developing a risk assessment, consideration of weight-of-the-evidenceand more probable than not criterion on key assumptions, scientific peerreview of assessments, scoping scientific input appropriately with thenature of a specific regulatory activity, emphasizing research whichenhances the basis of risk assessment, and education and communicationon risk matters. The policy principles are interdependent; collectivelythey need endorsement and promotion by the scientific and regulatorycommunities and by policy leaders in federal and state governments inthe interest of establishing a framework for further improving the basisof critical decisions for protecting public health.</TEXT></DOC>
