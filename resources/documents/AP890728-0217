In 1950, rural residents were morethan a third of all Americans.   In 1985-86, 632,000 people moved out of non-metro areas, thegovernment says. In contrast, in the 1970s, non-metro areas (oftenused synonymously with rural) netted more than 350,000 people ayear.</TEXT><NOTE>FARMING:</NOTE><TEXT>   Farming reached an apex in 1916 and the population has beenfalling since. In the early and mid 1980s, rising interest ratesand declining land values contributed to an exodus that saw morethan 1 million people leave the land and 273,000 farms go out ofbusiness from 1980 to '88.</TEXT><NOTE>UNEMPLOYMENT:</NOTE><TEXT>   The fading small-town economy, the early '80s recession, themovement of factory jobs to the Third World and increasingmechanization in coal mining, agriculture, timber and paper millshave shrunk employment opportunities.   From 1979 to '86, rural areas lost 733,000 manufacturing, miningand farm jobs, the government reports.   Unemployment in non-metro areas averaged 6.9 percent for 1988compared with 5.1 percent in metro areas. In 1979, the metrojobless rate was higher.   Another major shift in rural America has been the dramatic riseof farm women in the labor force in the past two decades. Accordingto 1980 census figures, more than half of all farm women workedoutside the home; 78 percent in a University of Nebraskaseven-state study said economic reasons drove them into their newjobs. In 1940, 12.1 percent of farm women were in the labor force;in 1960, it was 22.9 percent.</TEXT><NOTE>POVERTY:</NOTE><TEXT>   More than 9 million of American's poor live outside metro areas,according to a 1989 report by the Center on Budget and PolicyPriorities, a Washington group that researches issues relating tothe poor. The rate of non-metro residents living in povertyincreased from 13.7 percent to 16.9 percent from 1977 to '87, thereport said.   For blacks, poverty is more common in non-metro areas than incentral cities, it said. More than half of all non-metro poor livein the South and less than 10 percent of the rural poor live onfarms.</TEXT><NOTE>SERVICES:</NOTE><TEXT>   Deregulation led to cutbacks in air and bus service, leavingmany small towns more isolated than ever. From 1982 to 1986, 4,514places lost bus service, according to the Interstate CommerceCommission. From 1980 to '88, 208 rural hospitals closed, theAmerican Hospital Association said.   Medicare payments to rural hospitals are smaller than to urbanones, based on the premise that services cost less. One result ismany small facilities have drastically cut the level of care or notbought sophisticated equipment.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 6</NOTE></DOC>
