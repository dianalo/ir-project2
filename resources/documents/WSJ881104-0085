Aggressive energy conservation would be more effective than an alternative method for reducing the carbon-dioxide level in the atmosphere that causes the so-called greenhouse effect. That alternative calls for converting electric-power plants and other coal-burning industries to natural gas from high-carbon coal, according to the study.    &quot;Direct substitution of conventional natural gas for coal in existing coal boilers is not an attractive option,&quot; the researchers at two Energy Department laboratories said in their draft report. If required nationwide, it would cost between $8 billion and $48 billion a year, depending on future fuel prices. While there is still &quot;substantial uncertainty&quot; about the cost of energy conservation, it would be the cheaper alternative, they concluded.    But the U.S. can't solve the greenhouse effect single-handedly. Even if the U.S. used conservation efforts to hold its emissions to 1985 levels, and the rest of world didn't do anything to conserve energy, it would lower projected global emissions by only 7%, they said.    The government could foster energy conservation on a grand scale by such means as further tightening fuel-economy standards for cars and trucks, requiring more-efficient electric appliances and setting tougher standards for building insulation, said Marc Ross, a University of Michigan physicist who was consulted on the study.    &quot;I think you can do a great deal with conservation,&quot; said Mr. Ross, an expert on energy use. &quot;It will take government intervention because there are so many players here. You have 80 million households using appliances. You have 100,000 to 200,000 contractors who have to learn how to better insulate houses.&quot;    Beyond a certain point, energy conservation becomes expensive, he said. &quot;But improving the fuel economy of cars is still less costly than developing new oil and natural gas fields or converting power plants to natural gas.&quot;    The researchers' findings offer &quot;real hope,&quot; said Sen. Patrick Leahy (D., Vt.), who released the draft report yesterday. &quot;The message is that if we are prepared to make tough decisions, we can avoid a dramatic rise in {carbon dioxide}. If we get off the current do-nothing scenario, we can do something about one of the main causes of global warming.&quot;    The Energy Department researchers were from Brookhaven National Laboratory and the Pacific Northwest Laboratory's Washington office. In citing the drawbacks to substituting natural gas for coal, they didn't rule out the option altogether, but said it also was necessary to reduce U.S. emissions. </TEXT></DOC>
