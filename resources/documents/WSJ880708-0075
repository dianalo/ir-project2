Hastings.    The subcommittee charged that Judge Hastings conspired with a Washington lawyer to receive a bribe in exchange for modifying the sentences of two convicted racketeers, that he lied during his 1983 trial on these charges and that he compromised a Federal Bureau of Investigation wiretap by leaking information from it to a target. The judge was acquitted at the trial.    &quot;It ain't over. It's far from over,&quot; Judge Hastings said at the U.S. District Courthouse in Miami, where he had been participating in a trial. Judge Hastings called the proceedings politically motivated and said the subcommittee's decision shows the members &quot;do not respect the jury system.&quot;    The subcommittee's resolution goes next to the full committee. If the full House impeaches Judge Hastings, the Senate would conduct a trial to determine whether to remove him from office. </TEXT></DOC>
