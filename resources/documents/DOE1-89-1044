A set of computer controlled feedback loopscalculate the parameters of each bunch from beam position monitor datain the appropriate extraction line. The angles ad positions are correctedby orthogonal sets of steering dipoles. The energy is corrected by adjustingthe phase of two upstream sectors of the linac. This paper discussesthe data acquisition and algorithms.</TEXT></DOC>
