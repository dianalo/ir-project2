StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 04/17/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> JAPAN CANDA EUROP FRESTMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD) </IN><TEXT>   The dollar rallied in overseas trading yesterday after Treasury Secretary James Baker gave his most convincing indication yet that he wants an end to the currency's decline.    Much of the gain was later reversed, however, by profit-taking and continued bearishness among traders.    In late New York trading, the dollar was still showing a sizable gain against the Japanese yen but was little changed from a day earlier against major European currencies.    Yesterday's abrupt rate moves were partly due to thin trading ahead of the Easter holiday weekend. European and some Asian currency markets will be closed today and Monday, and many U.S. operations plan reduced staffing levels.    The dollar's rise began in Asia in reaction to Mr. Baker's Wednesday night speech in New York to the Japan Society. He said a further decline in the U.S. currency's value &quot;could very well be counterproductive&quot; to the goal of more rapid economic growth in other major countries. His remarks were viewed by many traders as the clearest sign yet that the Reagan administration truly wants a more stable dollar.    Mr. Baker's previous statements on exchange rates generally struck currency traders as ambiguous and failed to convince them that the administration has abandoned its policy of encouraging a weaker dollar to reduce the U.S. trade deficit.    &quot;As did most people in the market, I believed Baker wanted to see this dollar fall further,&quot; William G. Orsini, corporate foreign exchange manager at Bank of Montreal in New York, said. &quot;But now I think maybe he sees some of the potential dangers of a continued fall and wants things to stabilize.&quot;    Mr. Baker's comments carry weight because he has been the point man in the Reagan administration's campaign for a lower dollar since 1985.    &quot;It's really significant if he comes out and says something contrary to that,&quot; Mr. Orsini said. In theory, a weaker currency should help cut the trade deficit by making imports more expensive and U.S. exports less costly on world markets.    But even Mr. Baker's remarks weren't enough to erase negative feelings among some market participants toward the U.S. currency. By late in the New York trading day, the dollar had given up much of its gain to stand at 1.8105 West German marks, barely higher than 1.8100 Wednesday and down sharply from its intraday high of 1.8268 marks in Asian trading. It performed similarly against other European currencies.    Against the Japanese currency, the dollar climbed 0.9% to 143.00 yen, its highest level in a week, from 141.70 Wednesday. Its high yesterday was 143.85 yen.    In early Tokyo trading Friday, the dollar inched up to 143.15 yen.    In his speech, Mr. Baker reiterated U.S. support for a seven-nation agreement to enforce exchange-rate stability. In accordance with that agreement, the central banks of Japan, West Germany, France, Britain and the U.S. have intervened in currency markets to support the dollar against the yen since late March, but with little effect.    Jeff Mondschein, a trader at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York, said Mr. Baker's remarks may have been prompted by administration fears of the damage a further dollar decline could bring to U.S. securities markets.    &quot;I don't think they came to their senses until they saw the pain in the stock and bond markets,&quot; he said, referring to those markets' sharp losses early this week.    Despite what they perceive as the Treasury secretary's new tone, traders are reluctant to give up their long-term bearish view on the dollar, mainly because of the persistent U.S. trade deficit.    Albert Soria, vice president and head of foreign exchange at Swiss Bank Corp. in New York, said the dollar would face heavy selling by Japanese exporters if it comes near 145 yen, so its potential long-range gains are limited, in his view.    The traders also say the administration might resume its &quot;dollar-bashing&quot; policy if the U.S.'s major trading partners fail to adopt policies designed to even out world trade flows.    &quot;Baker knows this is a weapon that can be brought out at any time. He's keeping it in reserve,&quot; Carmine J. Rotondo, vice president and chief corporate dealer at Security Pacific National Bank in New York, said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1 to $444.10 an ounce in brisk trading. Estimated volume was five million ounces.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                 Thursday, April 16, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
