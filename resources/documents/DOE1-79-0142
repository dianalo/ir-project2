A number of system models are studied, and their diagnosabilityconditions established. Fault-diagnosis algorithms for some models areproposed and complexity of diagnosis problem analyzed for some othermodels. Finally, some fault-tolerant computer networks are studied, andefficient routing algorithms are proposed for these networks.</TEXT></DOC>
