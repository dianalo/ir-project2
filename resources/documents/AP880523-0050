AHN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of protesters hurledfirebombs, battled riot squads and stormed three police stations inthe southern city of Kwangju today in the latest wave ofanti-government unrest, police said.   Students shouting ``Down with the military'' and ``Drive out theYankees'' smashed windows and doors of the stations in the citybefore they were driven off by poice, authorities said.   About 3,000 protesters later battled police near ChonnamUniversity after trying to march off campus.   Students surged out of the university gates and pelted policewith rocks and firebombs that exploded in showers of blazinggasoline. Police in riot gear drove them back with tear gas.   Police said 23 protesters had been arrested, but declined to saywhether there were injuries.   The clashes came as radical groups continued to press for a fullinvestigation into the army's bloody suppression of a 1980 revoltin Kwangju in which at least 191 people were killed.   Radicals have clashed with police for six straight days inKwangju, 165 miles south of Seoul. Hundreds of students fromcolleges across the nation have poured into the city in recent daysto take part in protests.   Other parts of South Korea were reported quiet today, a nationalholiday marking the birth of Buddha.   On Sunday, 1,200 students hurled rocks at police near ChonnamUniversity. Police in riot gear fired tear gas to drive theprotesters back into the school.   National police remained on nationwide alert against renewedprotests. Riot police squadrons guarded key government buildings inSeoul and other major cities.   A series of demonstrations last week were the worst politicalunrest since nationwide anti-government violence last summer forcedthe government to agree to presidential elections and broad reforms.   Radical students and dissidents took to the streets on the May18 anniversary of the Kwangju uprising and called for the overthrowof President Roh Tae-woo's government.   Protesters contend that Roh, a top general in 1980, played a keyrole in suppressing the revolt. They demand that he be investigatedand punished.   Roh won the presidency in December without receiving a majorityof the vote after two opposition candidates split theanti-government balloting.   The new government has introduced broad democratic reforms, butradical groups remain determined to oust the administration.   The demostrations have been strongly anti-American, with radicalstudents claiming the United States keeps the Roh government inpower. Protesters called for the removal of the 42,000 U.S. troopsbased in South Korea under a mutual defense pact.   Police officials in Seoul today said that seven students whoattacked the U.S. Embassy with bombs Friday had been formallycharged with assault and illegally demonstrating. A police officerand two students were hurt in the incident, but there was no damageto the embassy.   The officials, who declined to be identified, said they werehunting for two other students believed to have masterminded theattack.</TEXT></DOC>
