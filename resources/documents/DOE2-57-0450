<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-57-0450 </DOCNO><TEXT>The 15-m diameter James Clerk Maxwell Telescope has been used to map theJ=2-1 transition of /sup 12/CO in a sample of highly opaque molecularclouds, each having at least one associated IRAS source with infraredflux characteristic of an embedded core. Seven clouds from this samplehave been mapped so far, five of which display outflow activity. Twoof these outflows, in the Lynds dark clouds L100 and L483, were previouslyunknown and both exhibit bipolar structures. We present maps of theseand of two others where the new observations are significantly betterthan existing data.</TEXT></DOC>
