The decision will require the department to reconsider theapplications of at least 150,000 New York state residents,according to the New York Attorney General's office, whichbrought the case. Although it applies only to New Yorkresidents, the decision could be used to challenge thedepartment's policy in other states.</LP><TEXT>   The court in Manhattan ruled that since 1980, thedepartment has unfairly relied on treadmill tests todetermine whether heart-disease patients were disabled.   &quot;The treadmill test, while recommended by many medicalexperts as a good diagnostic tool, results in misdiagnosis ofischemic heart disease on more than one-third of theoccasions,&quot; the appeals court said. Ischemic heart disease,caused by the narrowing of the arteries, is the most commonheart ailment. &quot;An individual who doesn't show signs of heartdisease during the treadmill test may still be severelydisabled from ischemia,&quot; the court said.   HHS has great leeway in deciding how benefits are granted,but it overstepped its authority in using only the treadmilltest to evaluate heart-disease patients, the court said.Instead of solely relying on the treadmill test, the agencyshould also consider doctors' evaluations, angiographreadings and other tests that give a more complete picture ofwhether the patient is disabled by the disease, the courtsaid.   &quot;As a result of this decision, the federal government willno longer be able to cruelly deny justly deserved benefits tothousands of vulnerable disabled people,&quot; said New YorkAttorney General Robert Abrams in a statement. &quot;The policywas just another example of the Reagan administration'sefforts to balance the budget on the backs of the weakest inour society.&quot;   The decision will also require the U.S. to pick up the tabfor millions of dollars in disability benefits that New Yorkstate has been paying, Mr. Abrams's office said. New Yorkestimates that it pays $8 million annually in such benefits,and that the U.S. owes it $50 million for payments made since1980.   Diogenes Kekatos, an assistant U.S. Attorney whorepresented HHS, said no decision has been made on whether toappeal the decision.   David Udell, an attorney with Legal Services for theElderly in New York, said the case was the first class-actionto challenge the agency's reliance on the treadmill test. Hesaid the decision is likely to be used in challenging theagency's policy in other states as well.</TEXT></DOC>
