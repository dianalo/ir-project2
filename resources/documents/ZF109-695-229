Tierney, Energy's deputy associate director of administration,information and facilities management.andM;Aside from pressing for stiff penalties to fight what he called the &quot;RobinHood perception&quot; of hackers as benign, Tierney said Energy also is tryingharder to prevent and respond to worm and virus attacks.andM;As part of a reorganization last April, the department centralized itsunclassified security functions in the newly created Information TechnologySecurity Branch, which is responsible for all 77 Energy sites.andM;&quot;We have more full-time people devoted to security than we ever had,&quot; saidPhillip Sibert, a computer specialist with the IT Security Branch inGermantown, Md.andM;Energy's Defense Programs office handles the classified side of computersecurity and, along with the IT Security Branch, funds the CIAC team.andM;Network worms get lots of publicity because they can affect so many people atonce, but equally harmful are viruses that infect individual systems.andM;&quot;People underestimate the trouble viruses cause,&quot; Schultz said.andP;  &quot;There aresome very menacing ones out there, especially in the MS-DOS arena.&quot;andM;A virus called Disk Killer, for example, can destroy all the data on a microhard drive if the system is turned off -- a common reaction by the user.andP;  Thedata is encrypted by the virus and can be recovered by deciphering theencryption scheme.andP;  Shutting the power off destroys the encryption scheme andthe ability to decrypt the data.andM;The CIAC team now spends 40 percent of its time helping DOE workers recoverfrom viruses, while preparing for an onslaught of something even moredangerous: so-called stealth viruses.andP;  This next generation conceals itselfby changing filenames and last-write dates, which defeats two of the ways todetect conventional viruses.andM;Can CIAC win this fight?andP;  &quot;I think we're going in the right direction, butwe're getting there pretty slowly,&quot; Schultz said.andP;  &quot;It's not like a bankrobbery where you get a videotape of a person holding a gun to the teller'shead.andP;  Pinpointing who perpetrated a network attack is much trickier.&quot;andM;In addition to these technical challenges, CIAC suffers from high staffturnover due to the stress of being on call 24 hours a day, seven days aweek.andM;&quot;We're a bit fatigued from the constant time demands.andP;  We can get a callanytime day or night,&quot; said Schultz, who uses his doctorate in psychology tokeep team members' morale up.andM;&quot;I admire their dedication and technical knowledge,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Most peoplewouldn't be able to last with the stress.andP;  They have stuck with it and reallymade a difference.&quot;andM;Schultz urged government computer users and managers to close up the holes intheir systems.andM;&quot;If one person gets sloppy and leaves the machine open and someone is able toget a root account or privileged account, then we all have a problem,&quot; hesaid.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
