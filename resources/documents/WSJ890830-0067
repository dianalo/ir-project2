It is a forbidding, top-secret place, 6,550 acres protected by armored vehicles, sentry towers and barbed wire.    But it may not be protected against the company that runs it.    Rockwell International Corp., the maker of the space shuttle and other spectacular flying machines, can't seem to get its act together as a bomb-builder. At Rocky Flats and at plutonium-producing Hanford Reservation, which Rockwell operated until 1987, the company's record has been marred by sloppiness and sometimes-blatant disregard for federal regulations.    In March 1988, the Department of Energy formally cited Rockwell for &quot;a breakdown in the classic management responsibilities to organize, direct, plan and assess the safety of the activities&quot; at Rocky Flats, which makes the plutonium triggers that detonate warheads. An internal DOE memo in 1986 criticized the plant as &quot;in poor condition generally in terms of environmental compliance&quot; and called some of its waste facilities &quot;patently illegal.&quot; Two years earlier, the Federal Bureau of Investigation found that a part of the plant supposed to be making high-tech weapons mock-ups was actually making gifts for DOE officials.    And last June, the FBI dropped the biggest bomb of all. As 72 agents swooped down on the Flats, as locals call the plant, the agency alleged that Rockwell had dumped cancer-causing chemicals into nearby streams and burned hazardous waste in a supposedly closed incinerator. The criminal investigation, dubbed Operation Desert Glow, is likely to last up to a year and may ultimately decide whether Rockwell gets any more DOE contracts. A federal grand jury began considering evidence in the case a few weeks ago.    As various troubles have hit the nation's 17 principal bomb-making plants -- with the shuttering of unsafe reactors, exposure of workers to potentially harmful radiation, and mushrooming waste-disposal problems -- the DOE has borne the brunt of the public's criticism. But a look at Rockwell shows how contractor mismanagement can cause bomb-plant problems, which can fester when mixed with DOE laxity.    &quot;Rocky Flats is firmly in the hands of Rockwell International,&quot; contends Nathaniel J. Miullo, the Environmental Protection Agency official who oversees the plant's compliance with pollution rules. He notes that the company has 5,200 employees here, DOE only about 60.    Rockwell denies knowingly doing anything wrong at the Flats. &quot;We've done a noble, patriotic job,&quot; says Sam Iacobellis, one of the company's three chief operating officers, a man best known as the highly successful pitchman for the B-1B bomber. At the company's El Segundo, Calif., headquarters, he offers statistics showing that the plant's worker injury rate is 60% below the average for U.S. industrial companies, and he notes that the Flats has never had an uncontrolled nuclear reaction. He also observes that certain DOE reports about Rockwell management have been decidedly favorable and that one senior department official said, before the FBI raid, that the company had turned Rocky Flats into a model facility.    &quot;You think I'd go there if I thought it was unsafe?&quot; Mr. Iacobellis asks.    Earlier this month, Energy Secretary James Watkins also expressed confidence that Rocky Flats is now &quot;safely doing its job . . . with a lot of new oversight, new management on the part of Rockwell International {and} new management on the part of DOE.&quot;    Within weeks, however, Watkins-appointed investigators determined that plutonium -- one of the most lethal substances on earth -- is still &quot;found in situations that require immediate attention&quot; at the Flats. They also said Rockwell should give &quot;more careful attention to preventing and mitigating the consequences of human error.&quot;    Local critics are more worried than ever. &quot;You're talking about a catastrophe,&quot; says Niels Schonbeck, a chemistry professor at Denver's Metropolitan State College and a member of a state panel monitoring the cleanup of the facility, which lies just 16 miles outside the capital. &quot;It's going to be very hard to convince people it's a different day,&quot; adds Rep. Patricia Schroeder, a Colorado Democrat.    Indeed, talks with Mr. Iacobellis raise doubts about how seriously Rockwell takes its censure. Asked about safety, for example, he boasts of company T-shirts declaring: &quot;Safety -- Watch It Grow at Rocky Flats.&quot; He addresses questions on bomb-plant accountability by handing over Rockwell's code of ethics -- standard fare for any major company. And he casually describes Rockwell's primary aim as pleasing its customer, in this case the government. &quot;We're like Kelly girls,&quot; he says.    The diversified aerospace company entered the nuclear-weapons business 14 years ago, inheriting Rocky Flats from Dow Chemical Co. Rockwell, which has never viewed bomb production as a large part of its business, saw it as a flag-waving way to keep abreast of nuclear technology. A leader in nuclear energy since the late 1950s, Rockwell was among the first to send atom-derived power -- 7.5 megawatts -- through a commercial grid.    If there was a price, the company figured, it would be government's close scrutiny at the bomb plants. Then-Chairman Robert Anderson said in 1975 that Rockwell would be &quot;placed under a microscope&quot; after taking over the Flats, which, like many weapons facilities, had a long legacy of problems. Among them: persistent leaks of plutonium from contaminated oil drums and large fires in 1957 and 1969.    Oversight by DOE, however, has turned out to be spotty at best. The FBI is even charging that the department abetted the illegal storage and disposal of toxic waste at Rocky Flats and helped cover up Rockwell's alleged misdeeds.    In 1977, Rockwell took over Hanford, a 570-square-mile complex in southeastern Washington state, and for the next decade was blasted by regulators for ignoring safety hazards there.    House Energy and Commerce Committee investigators charged in a 1988 report, for example, that two workers had received plutonium puncture wounds while replacing filters in a piece of equipment that Rockwell knew was of flawed design. Casey Ruud -- Rockwell's lead auditor at Hanford at the time and now an outspoken company critic -- says supervisors had ordered the workers to pull out the jammed filters without wearing protective rubber gloves. &quot;The managers in charge said, 'Throw those gloves off and go to it,'&quot; Mr. Ruud recalls. Rockwell declines to comment on the incident.    The scope of the Hanford problems is difficult to determine because of an apparent clampdown on bad news about the plant. A 1982 memo distributed by a Rockwell manager said that if employees reported company problems to the government, &quot;I will take action to terminate that person immediately.&quot; Mr. Iacobellis says the memo may have simply meant that the manager wanted to be involved in solving problems. Hushing employees is &quot;just not our policy,&quot; he says, and anyone who does it &quot;isn't going to hack it at Rockwell.&quot;    An embarrassing moment at Hanford occurred when Washington Gov. Booth Gardner rode past a spill of low-level radioactive material because someone had taken down warning signs. Rockwell now terms the event &quot;a pointless error since the same signs were in a number of other places&quot; around Hanford.    Pointless or not, the highly publicized incident was Rockwell's undoing at Hanford, many believe. When the DOE consolidated operations there in 1987, Rockwell lost its management contract to Westinghouse Electric Corp. &quot;The handwriting was on the wall,&quot; says Dan Silver, a special assistant to Gov. Gardner. Rockwell says it doesn't believe that its rejection stemmed from the governor's visit.    It is at the Flats, in any case, that the company has stumbled most seriously. In the raid four years ago, FBI agents descended on an area known as the &quot;model shop,&quot; which is supposed to make nonexplosive replicas of weapons for research, testing and display. What they found was that for more than a decade, Warren Rooker, the Rockwell manager in charge, had been manufacturing baseball caps, belt buckles, cabinets, car parts, coffee mugs, cuff links, earrings, foot massagers, grandfather clocks -- even a staircase. He had workers make paperweights with this question written on the bottom: &quot;Would we lie to you?&quot; Records show that Mr. Rooker gave these items, at taxpayers' expense, to DOE officials.    Though Mr. Rooker was fired, a lawsuit brought under the False Claims Act by a former Rockwell employee, J. David Navarette, alleges that the company never disciplined others involved.    Mr. Rooker couldn't be reached for comment, and Rockwell won't say much because the suit is pending in federal district court in Denver. But Mr. Iacobellis contends it &quot;promptly informed&quot; the DOE after learning of the misuse of the model shop, cooperated fully with the FBI and took &quot;a number of corrective actions to prevent a recurrence of such activities.&quot;    Most of the recent concerns have been about safety.    In its March 1988 report on Rocky Flats management, the DOE specifically examined buildings No. 776 and No. 777 and found radiation-protection, fire-protection and quality-assurance problems. The report said, &quot;Although management policy statements strongly supported safety, the organizational structure, the diffusion of responsibilities, the lack of correlation between authorities and responsibilities, the deficiencies in the oversight program {and} limited accountability throughout the entire organization were all contributing factors&quot; to the difficulties.    Dominick Sanchini, the president of Rockwell's Rocky Flats operations, acknowledges that &quot;we got hit pretty hard&quot; by the DOE appraisal. &quot;It was obvious that we weren't safe enough and could do better,&quot; he says. Although &quot;we still have a ways to go,&quot; he adds, the company is now on the right track toward &quot;a new awareness&quot; about safety and quality. He even sent a letter to Rocky Flats employees last October, saying, &quot;Our entire way of doing business has changed, and we are very proud of our accomplishments.&quot;    Rockwell, for example, says it has made great strides in dealing with worker exposure to beryllium, a grayish-black metal used in various industrial processes. Though at least 11 workers have been exposed over the years -- one died from beryllium poisoning, according to court records -- Rockwell says others are being closely monitored by company medical personnel. Rockwell adds that since a 1984 DOE study pointed out shortcomings in its beryllium operations, it has spent $3.5 million to reduce airborne concentrations of the substance.    Similarly, Rockwell attempts to put in the best light a finding by the General Accounting Office, the congressional investigative arm, that levels of solvents in Rocky Flats ground water exceed certain standards by as much as 1,000 times. In addition, a September 1988 environmental survey by the DOE also ranked water contamination at the plant as the No. 1 potential health hazard at any of its nuclear-weapons facilities. The company says it doesn't consider this as a danger and is preparing to clean things up during the 40 years it would take for contaminants to migrate off site.    But, at times, the government has seen a need to remind Rockwell of its responsibilities. After the latest FBI raid, Energy Secretary Watkins wrote Chairman Donald Beall that &quot;we are not in a position to produce at all until we are in a position to meet all environmental, safety and health requirements.&quot;    The secretary has been among the first to recognize publicly that for 40 years the DOE, pressured by various Pentagon arms buildups, gave its contractors one priority above all others: Make more bombs. Since taking office this year, however, Mr. Watkins has pledged to make sure that contractors comply fully with every rule on the books.    Facing a stricter regulatory environment, Rockwell may want to &quot;get out of the business,&quot; says Jack Modzelewski, who was a Rockwell executive before becoming a PaineWebber Inc. securities analyst last year. There hasn't ever been much profit in nuclear weapons. In its best six-month period here, Rockwell earned, in effect, only $4.8 million; its total net income in the fiscal year ended Sept. 30, 1988, was $811.9 million. Even before he left, Mr. Modzelewski says, Rockwell was asking itself: &quot;For a few pennies a share, do we need all this trouble?&quot;    Some outsiders believe that dropping out under government fire could scar the spirit of a company that views itself as a nuclear pioneer. But Rockwell, which also has a classified DOE contract at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, says it plans to continue producing nuclear-weapons parts.    After all, Mr. Iacobellis says, opponents of Rocky Flats lack proper perspective. He quotes a study showing that anyone living within 50 miles of the plant would have about a one-in-a-billion annual risk of dying of cancer -- and that is if an accident occurred here. By contrast, he says, Colorado residents have a one-in-65 chance of dying in a motor-vehicle accident.    His local adversaries, though, say such responses only deflect the real issues. &quot;There has been a lot of swaggering on the part of Rockwell,&quot; charges Paula Elofson-Gardine, a local activist. &quot;When we talk about cutting down on contaminants at the plant, we're literally met with laughter.&quot; Adrienne Anderson, who has taken on Martin Marietta Corp., Manville Corp. and others for the Denver office of the National Toxics Campaign, an environmental group, says Rockwell &quot;stands out as a corporation that has been callous to the public.&quot;    The latest allegations appear to anger residents the most. The FBI says that late last year it sent an airplane over an incinerator where two workers and an inspector had been exposed to radiation and which wasn't supposed to reopen until Jan. 20. But on three nights in December, the bureau says, the plane took infrared photos that proved the &quot;incincerator stack was thermally active.&quot;    Mr. Iacobellis denies that. He says Rockwell hasn't seen any evidence that the incinerators were turned on or that it engaged in any midnight dumping of pollutants. The work force here, he says, has &quot;consistently compiled the finest record for health and safety&quot; among the DOE's weapons plants.    Says the EPA administrator, Mr. Miullo: &quot;I've looked into their eyes. These people want to do a good job. They have families that live downstream from the facility.&quot; But Mr. Miullo, who supplied information to the FBI that helped spark the latest raid at Rocky Flats, adds: &quot;Some things have made me uneasy. And obviously the FBI and the Department of Justice saw some things that made them uneasy, too.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
