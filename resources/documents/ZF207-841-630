 Itoccurred during my tenure as a judge, where I had responsibility for rulingon claims by workers that they had been injured as a result of their dutieson the job.andP;  One of these cases was brought by an employee of a chipmanufacturing firm located in what was just beginning to be referred to as&quot;Silicon Valley&quot;.andP;  The plaintiff was having serious respiratory problems,which her doctor felt had most likely been caused by a substance she wasbeing exposed to in the course of her work.andM;Judges--as I've remarked here on several occasions--are considered to begeneralists and supposedly need no specialized background to be able to dealwith controversies that involve highly technical processes.andP;  That notion wasto be put to the test in this litigation, I quickly found out.andP;  Fortunately,a judge has the prerogative of interrupting at any time to ask questions.andO;Although today I blush to think of some of the inquiries I was obliged tomake (&quot;Just waht is a wafer?&quot; is one that comes to mind), as the trialprogressed the basics of this weird new technology did begin to take shape inmy mind.andM;Then the case took an unusual turn.andP;  Because the plaintiff's claim ofinjurious environmental exposure was a novel one, and because it waspotentially of great importance to the industry, the lawyers for both sidesfelt strongly that I should personally tour the worksite while operationswere in progress.andM;As you might know, it is not standard procedure for a judge to be allowed toinspect the scene of an event figuring in a lawsuit.andP;  Actually, it is aviolation of judicial ethics for a judge to go on his or her own initiativeto look at such a locale--in fact, judges are supposed to go out of theirway, if necessary, to avoid seeing such places.andP;  One reason for this is thatthere might have been changes since the incident in litigation took place, orthere might be some aspect of the situation that calls for explanation.andP;  Butabove all else, such first-hand input would violate the principle accordingto which a trier of fact--whether a judge or a jury--may take into accountonly information that has been presented in court by the parties involved.andM;So it is not just a matter of asking the judge to run over and take a peek at&quot;the scene of the crime&quot;.andP;  The lawyers for each side have to go along, and sodoes a court reporter, who must take down every word spoken within earshot ofthe judge.andP;  (Before anyone at the scene can tell the judge anything, he orshe has to be sworn as a witness.)andP;  The plaintiff has a right to be there, ofcourse, as does the defendant, or, if the defendant is a corporation, arepresentative of management.andP;  Indeed, the scene can get downright crowded,and can end up lookin a lot like a movie company doing location filming.andO;Considering all these logistical complications, small wonder that judges arenormally reluctant to consent to such on-site inspections.andM;This case I was involved in was an exception, though.andP;  It was clear that theplaintiff was ill, and expert witnesses called by her lawyer had testifiedthat a study reported in a Soviet journal established that one of thecompounds utilized in her work area was indeed capable of causing the sort ofrespiratory difficulties she was experiencing.andP;  Defense witnesses couldn'trebut this claim, since no other studies could be found.andP;  The question, then,was whether the plaintiff had in fact been inhaling this substance in thecourse of her work.andP;  Since the defendant asserted that its elaborateventilation apparatus made this quite impossible, it made sense to go take alook.andM;So along with my court reporter, I made the 40-mile journey to the southernend of San Francisco Bay.andP;  The last time I had been in that area its aspecthad still been predominantly agricultural, with mile upon mile of orchardssurrounding somewhat somnolent little communities.andP;  Now, however, I found anendless grid of multilane arterials flanked by acres of ivy surrounding mileupon mile dof sprawling structures that all looked as though they had beendesigned for some modern college campus.andP;  This, then, was the new &quot;clean&quot;industry I had been reading about.andP;  The contrast with the belt of traditional&quot;smokestack&quot; enterprises we had driven through less than an hour before wasso impressive that I gave little attention to the slight, but neverthelessdiscernible haze that seemed to engulf everything in Silicon Valley.andM;Inside the defendant's building, the contrast with the &quot;old&quot; style ofindustry was still apparent.andP;  Coffee was poured and introductions were madein sleek workspaces dominated by artwork and potted ficus trees.andP;  When wereached the fabrication area, the scene resembled a Hollywood director'sconception of the sparkling high-tech future.andP;  The image was marred only by apersistent ambient sound.andP;  There was a lot of ventilation, all right--it wasnoisy enough to give the court reporter fits, though somehow he managed totake down all the explanations and replies to questions verbatim.andP;  But as itturned out, the ventilating devices didn't get the defendant off the hook.andM;As we were able to observed, the positive exhaust systems on the electricfurnaces in which silicon wafers were being finished did successfully suck upnearly all the visible fumes being emitted.andP;  I said nearly, not completely.andO;At regular intervals, a tiny wisp of vapor could be seen spiraling into theatmosphere in the work area, and this, I knew from testimony, would contain abit of the compound in question.andP;  In the course of the plaintiff's workoperating one of these furnaces, she clearly would have been exposed to asmall amount of the offending substance.andM;From this point the decision was easy.andP;  Visibly, workers were being exposedto a toxin that, according to expert testimony, was capable of causing theplaintiff's symptoms, and no other possible explanation for her complaint hadbeen shown.andP;  Under the law, the fact that the amounts involved appeared to beminuscule didn't matter, nor did the circumstance that no one else had becomeill--at least not yet.andP;  Even assuming the plaintiff to be a uniquelysusceptible individual, the law required that her employer bearresponsibility for her condition.andM;Although the decision itself was obvious, the opinion I had to write tojustify it was not.andP;  Here, it seemed significant that no other employees werehaving problems.andP;  I'd seen enough, and also read enough, to realize that thiswas fast becoming an important industry.andP;  Of course, I didn't have the powerto close the plant down even had I wished to, but I knew that if I made afinding that the process involved in this work environment was inherentlyhazardous, there were bound to be repercussions.andM;In the end, I simply stated that it appeard the plaintiff was unusuallysensitive to the substance in question, and that the evidence would notsupport a broader conclusion--that the workplace was inherently unsafe, forexample.andP;  Nevertheless, I observed, further investigation into the potentialhazards of this compound would be desirable, so that in the future we mighthave a more accessible source of information than an obscure Russian study.andO;(I don't know whether this was ever followed up.andP;  Later, the defendant'sattorney did tell me that his client could live with the decision and haddecided not to appeal it.)andM;I haven't been inside a chip manufacturing facility since that time.andP;  Overthe years that followed this case, though, disquieting news items beganpopping up in the newspapers.andP;  There were reports of toxic substances inSilicon Valley groundwater, and these had been traced to major computercompanies.andP;  Then sites of former computer manufacturing operations were foundto be severely contaminated.andP;  Next, workers in industry facilitiesincreasingly began complaining that their health had been impaired as aresult of environmental conditional inside the plants.andP;  And now there isgrowing concern about the quality of the air in the vicinity of computermanufacturing facilities; some even suggest they might be contributing to thedeterioration of the Earth's ozone layer.andP;  Now, I ask myself a question thatdidn't cross my mind all those years back: exactly what does happen to thosegases after they've been sucked up by the positive exhaust systems?andM;Many people, it seems, are beginning to get the idea that computing is not as&quot;clean&quot; an industry as we once assumed.andP;  One commentator has gone so far asto call this Silicon Valley's &quot;dirty little secret&quot;.andP;  If it ever was intendedto be a secret, it is no longer one, and in tandem with the change in thepublic's perception the law is beginning to close in one the industry.andM;All enterprises are obliged to cope with legal vicissitudes, of course, butto date the computing industry has led a relatively charmed existence in thisrespect.andP;  Liability engendered by toxic substances may turn out to be itsAchilles' heel.andM;In general, there are three distinct areas in which a business potentiallymight find itself in hot water because of toxic materials.andP;  The first, aswe've seen, lies more or less within the enterprise, involving injuries toemployees and other persons in close association with it.andP;  The second areaencompasses injury to the public at large, including damage to theenvironment.andP;  Finally, there is the area of injuries sustained by customers.andO;By the nature of its products, this last area doesn't appear to be a majorconcern for the computing industry so far as toxins are concerned.andP;  The firsttwo areas are a different matter althogether.andM;Although the industry makes a big deal of its elaborate &quot;clean room&quot;precautions, critics charge that these are designed more for the protectionof products than for the benefit of workers.andP;  Lawyers are beginning torealize that there are fees to be gleaned from taking up the cause ofaggrieved workers, and labor unions are seizing upon employee safety as anissue that might enable them to penetrate what until now has been a largelynon-unionized industry.andP;  An official of the Communications Workers presentsthe unions' position: &quot;The carnage in the semiconductor workplace is notscored in the spilled blood of wage earners.andP;  .  .  .  Instead, it is imposedon the invisible world of workers' chromosomes and tissues through theingestion of hazardous substances.&quot;andM;The laws that govern employer liability for injuries to employees aregenerally the province of the states, though the federal government does playa role through its Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).andO;This agency sets safety standards, carries out inspections, and imposespenalties for violations.andP;  Some states, however, have taken advantage of aprovision in the federal law that allows them to set up their own OSHAs totake over the federal agency's functions.andP;  State OSHAs are permitted to setstricter safety standards than the federal law requires, and often have doneso.andP;  The various OSHAs have been increasingly active in the computingindustry--especially the semiconductor sector--and we're likely to hear agood deal more from them in the future.andM;The computing industry's liability vis-a-vis its employees for injuriesassociated with toxic exposures is mitigated by the fact that all US stateshave workers' compensation laws covering such situations.andP;  The details of thevarious state compensation systems vary widely, but in general they place acelling on the amount an injured employee can recover.andM;These laws don't apply, however, to someone who is not an employee--aconsultant, for instance.andP;  In this situation the regular laws governingpersonal injury lawsuits are applicable: the sky is the limit, so to speak.andM;Other groups of people associated with the industry also have the potentialto give computer companies considerable grief on account of toxic substances.andO;These include both landlords and lessors of properties a firm has beenconnected with in some fashion.andP;  But this overlaps our second area of concernfor the industry--liability for contamination of the environment.andP;  That areaof liability will be the subject of our next column.andM;Glenn Groenewold is a California attorney who devotes his time to writing andlecturing on computer law.andP;  He also has served as an administrative lawjudge.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
