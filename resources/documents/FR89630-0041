An EFP allows the delayed sorting practice,which otherwise would be prohibited by Federal regulations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATES</T2>: April 1, 1989 to August 31, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES</T2>: Send comments to E.C.

The procedures for issuing EFPsare at 50 CFR 663.10.A notice of the NMFS receiving an application from Eureka Fisheries Inc.for experimental permits for three mid-water trawl vessels was publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on June 22, 1988 (53 FR 23436). The purpose ofobtaining the permits is to delay sorting of the harvest by the trawlersuntil the fish is delivered to port. This shortens the time between harvestof Pacific whiting and placing the fish in refrigerated seawater. Whitingdeteriorates rapidly when caught; therefore, rapid refrigeration is necessaryto maintain product quality.The harvest of approximately 3,000 metric tons of whiting would most likelyinvolve an incidential catch of Pacific salmon. Since 50 CFR 663.7(b) prohibitsthe retention of any species of salmonid, an experimental permit is neededto conduct an effective shore-based whiting fishery.After public comments and review by the Pacific Fishery Management Council(Council) on November 18, 1988, the Council recommended that the incidentialcatch of salmon not exceed the limits placed on the joint venture fishery,which is 0.2 salmon per metric ton. The Council also did not want the retainedsalmon to have any effect on the salmon market; therefore, arrangementshave been made to dispose of the fish to charitable organizations. Theseconditions, in addition to reporting and recordkeeping requirements, wereincluded in the permits.Since the application has been received and reviewed, two vessels havewithdrawn, and only one vessel remains; therefore, a permit has been issuedto the owner of the one remaining vessel, <T3>Fishwish</T3>. Fishing operations under the conditions of the permitmay be conducted from Apil 1, 1989 to August 31, 1989. A copy of the permitmay be obtained from the NMFS Regional Director at the above address.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority</T4>: 16 U.S.C. 1801 <T3>et seq</T3>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Richard H.
