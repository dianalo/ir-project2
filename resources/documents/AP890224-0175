(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Unusually cold weather for Florida caughtnetwork television by surprise Friday, and citrus growers andvegetable farmers braced for a second night of arctic air.   Except for a potato crop in north Florida and some strawberrylosses, most fruit and vegetables made it through Thursday night'sfirst frosty blast of the winter without much trouble as a blustery,bone-chilling cold wave swept the length of the peninsula Thursdayand early Friday.   And unlike states to the north which had snow-covered highways,the snow that blew across Florida's northern tier from the Panhandleto Jacksonville was just enough to amaze people before it melted.   Police reported a minor traffic jam in Jacksonville Thursdayafternoon when drivers stopped along a major thoroughfare to watchsnow fall _ the first flurries there since March 1, 1986.   ``I've never seen it snow that hard here,'' said Pat Jones ofFort Walton Beach, in the Panhandle. ``Maybe it has snowed longer,but I've never seen it come down that hard. It lasted about fiveminutes, was very thick and very gray.''   Cities as far south as Miami had record lows in the 30s Fridaymorning.   The chilly weather at Miami Beach, which had a low of 39, forcedthe crew and stars of NBC's ``Today'' show indoors to the CarlyleHotel. The program had moved to Miami to boost a local affiliate andto show some warm weather to the rest of the shivering nation.   Snowbirds _ Northerners who move south for the winter _ gatheredoutside the hotel, bundled up in sweaters and coats to get a glimpseof Jane Pauley and Bryant Gumbel.   Nelson Sheinker, a retiree from Montreal, said the cooltemperatures at the beach didn't bother him. ``We're used to it.It's not that bad,'' he said.   Dick Wallace of Erie, Pa., was not complaining either.   ``This is 50 degrees warmer than the place we just left,'' hesaid.   Anyway, Wallace said, the Today people shouldn't have beensurprised: ``A week ago (``Today'' show weatherman) Willard Scottwarned us it would be cold.''   Temperatures early Saturday were predicted in the teens and low20s, meaning a hard freeze or frost all the way into lush citrus-andvegetable-growing areas of central and southern Florida.   ``It's going to be colder than last night,'' said forecasterEmmett Ricks.   There were scattered reports of damage to peaches andstrawberries. But farmers in the heart of strawberry country, PlantCity near Tampa, said cloud cover kept temperatures just abovefreezing and saved the fragile crop just one week before the annualPlant City Strawberry Festival.   ``The timing couldn't be worse,'' said Cheryl Meeks of PlantCity. ``Strawberries are at their prime. The fields and plants areloaded; they're just hanging there.''   Dick Whalley, a spokesman for the state's billion-dollar citrusindustry, said temperatures Thursday and Friday were not low enoughfor long enough periods to cause any damage anywhere in the citrusbelt.   Reggie Brown, spokesman for the Florida Fruit and VegetableAssociation, said, ``Basically most of the industry got by withoutany significant problem.''   One exception was a crop of early-spring potatoes in theHastings-Palatka area. The spuds had grown larger than normalbecause of the unusually warm weather of the past few weeks, andthey could not all be rebedded in time to escape freezingtemperatures Thursday night, Brown said. The extent of damage wasunknown.</TEXT></DOC>
