The new company will be named E-II Holdings Inc. The offering will consist of 36 million shares for as much as $18 each, giving it an indicated value of $648 million; E-II itself will offer 28.7 million shares, with the balance offered by certain shareholders.    Separately, Beatrice filed with the SEC for E-II debt offerings of $750 million in senior subordinated notes due 1997, and $750 million of subordinated debentures due 1999. Terms of the offerings weren't disclosed.    As reported last October, Beatrice, which was taken private in April 1986 in a $6.2 billion leveraged buyout, is said by sources to be readying public offerings for all of its huge food businesses. Those offerings are expected to split Beatrice's U.S. and international operations, and they could begin in a few weeks, sources said.    Donald P. Kelly, named chairman of Beatrice by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., the New York-based investment concern that took Beatrice private, was named to the additional positions of chairman and chief executive officer of E-II.    A spokesman said E-II is being &quot;formed to make acquisitions.&quot; Mr. Kelly, formerly chairman of Esmark Inc. (for which E-II is named), which was acquired by Beatrice in 1984, has a reputation for buying and selling companies, rather than revitalizing existing businesses.    E-II initially will have about $800 million in debt, or 20% of Beatrice's current total. Mr. Kelly's strategy, after completing the stock and debt offerings, is to pay off E-II's debt, leaving the company with roughly $1.2 billion cash. That cash will be an &quot;acquisition war chest,&quot; said a spokesman.    The spokesman wouldn't elaborate on what types of businesses Mr. Kelly wants to acquire. But he said Mr. Kelly wants to start acquisitions &quot;as soon as possible.&quot;    E-II's businesses will include Stiffel Lamps, Samsonite luggage and the Culligan water softener business. Its food lines will include Martha White baking mixes, Lowrey's meat snacks and a private-label pizza business.    Beatrice's food core includes Swift meats, Hunt's tomato products and Wesson cooking oil. The E-II offering continues Beatrice's strategy of shedding its non-food lines. Among the businesses Beatrice has sold separately in the last year are its International Playtex Inc. personal products division, its Avis Inc. car-rental unit and its Americold refrigerated warehouse business.    Beatrice wants to further pare its debt from the leveraged buyout before going public, sources have said. As previously reported, Beatrice is reducing debt so fast that it could reach the pre-buyout level of $2 billion by July.    Kohlberg Kravis plans to retain a stake of about 7% in E-II. The stock offering will be managed by Salomon Brothers Inc. The debt offering will be managed by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
