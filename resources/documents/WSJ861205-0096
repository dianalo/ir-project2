Boesky appears to have quickened his timetable for liquidating his arbitrage firm and its funds, as Wall Street traders report he is selling more stocks and will let some employees go by year's end.    Under his Nov. 14 settlement of insider-trading charges, Mr. Boesky has until April 1, 1988, to wind up his business interests. &quot;But the talk is it will be sooner than 1988,&quot; a spokesman for one of Mr. Boesky's limited partners says. A major holder of Boesky-issued debentures speculates that Mr. Boesky's funds could be completely out of the market within several weeks.    This week, for example, traders say Mr. Boesky's funds have sold blocks of stock in such companies as Lucky Stores Inc., Carter Hawley Hale Stores and Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. All these companies have figured in recent takeover bids, making them logical holdings for an arbitrager such as Mr. Boesky.    &quot;Certainly there have been sales of stocks,&quot; said Harvey Pitt, one of Mr. Boesky's attorneys. Mr. Pitt declined to say which stocks have been sold or in what quantities. But traders estimate that Mr. Boesky's main arbitrage fund, Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co. L.P., has shrunk its stock portfolio to $500 million or less. At its peak last summer, the fund held more than $1.6 billion of equities.    Meanwhile, several arbitragers said Boesky employees have told them of layoffs at Ivan F. Boesky Corp. The company, widely believed to be the largest arbitrage house in the U.S., has a seat on the New York Stock Exchange through an affiliate and manages several smaller arbitrage funds in addition to Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co.    The company recently employed more than 100 people, including 15 vice presidents. But a top Wall Street arbitrager said he has been told that Mr. Boesky's firm is letting most of its traders go and already has made cuts in its research department. Another arbitrager said most of the cuts are to be made by year's end.    &quot;It isn't inconceivable that people have left, or have been let go,&quot; Theodore Levine, another of Mr. Boesky's attorneys, said. But he declined to discuss the extent or timing of any layoffs. Other Boesky aides declined to comment, and Mr. Boesky wasn't available for comment.    Despite the signs of major cuts in Mr. Boesky's operations, it may be some time before all his business interests can be liquidated. Barring any legal claims, assets of Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co. are to be divided among Mr. Boesky's 43 limited partners and 40 debenture holders. So far, investors say, there isn't any formal plan for dividing the roughly $900 million that the limited partners and debenture holders put into the fund when it was formed in March.    Current estimates are that the investors' capital is largely intact but that there is unlikely to be any substantial profit from their investments. In fact, the stock market's dip in late November may have left the Boesky fund operating at a slight loss for the year.    When Mr. Boesky settled with the Securities and Exchange Commission in the insider-trading case, lawyers said much of the allotted time might be needed to dismantle the Ivan F. Boesky andamp; Co. arbitrage fund in a way that would minimize the impact on other investors.    But with much of the Boesky andamp; Co. portfolio already sold, and with investors apparently eager to close the books on the fund, a full liquidation early next year seems increasingly likely. &quot;There's been no date set,&quot; Mr. Pitt, the lawyer for Mr. Boesky, says. &quot;But the situation is progressing in an orderly fashion.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
