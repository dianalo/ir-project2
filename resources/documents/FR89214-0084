No. 15-16318)located in Harlan County, Kentucky. The petition is filed under section101(c) of the Federal Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977.A summary of the petitioner's statements follows:1. The petition concerns the requirement that intake and return aircoursesbe separated from belt haulage entries, and that belt haulage entries notbe used to ventilate active working places.2. As an alternate method, petitioner proposes to use the intake air whichis coursed through the belt haulage and/or track entries to ventilate activeworking places.3. In support of this request, petitioner proposes to install an earlywarning fire detection system utilizing a low-level carbon monoxide (CO)detection system in all belt entries used as intake aircourses and at eachbelt drive and tailpiece located in intake aircourses. The monitoring deviceswould be capable of giving warning of a fire for four hours should thepower fail; a visual alert signal would be activated when the CO levelis 10 parts per million (ppm) above ambient air and an audible signal wouldsound at 15 ppm above ambient air. All persons would be withdrawn to asafe area at 10 ppm and evacuated at 15 ppm. The fire alarm signal wouldbe activated at an attended surface location where there is two-way communication.The CO system would be capable of identifying any activated sensor, monitoringelectrical continuity and detecting electrical malfunctions.4. The CO system would be visually examined at least once each coal-producingshift and tested weekly to ensure the monitoring system is functioningproperly. The monitoring system would be calibrated with known concentrationsof CO and air mixtures at least monthly.5. If the CO monitoring system is deenergized for routine maintenance orfor failure of a sensor unit, the belt conveyor would continue to operateand qualified persons would patrol and monitor the belt conveyor usinghand-held CO detecting devices.6. The details for the fire detection system would be included as partof the ventilation system methane and dust control plan.7. Petitioner states that the proposed alternate method will provide thesame degree of safety for the miners affected as that afforded by the standard.<ITAG tagnum="84">Request for Comments</ITAG>Persons interested in this petition may furnish written comments.
