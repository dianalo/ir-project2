Water from St. John's Harbour wassuggested as the heat source for the heat pump, and a monitoring programwas undertaken to measure the water temperature at two depths in theharbor. During the study period, the temperature ranged from -1.5 to12/sup 0/C, and the fluctuations are influenced by both tidal and windeffects and by the sewage outfalls into the harbor. The performance characteristicsof a number of heat pumps were examined, and it was found that the harborwater temperature is too low for commercially available water-to-airheat pumps to operate economically. However, it is suggested that a closed-loop,water-to-air heat pump system is technically feasible and should be investigatedfurther. 13 refs., 7 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
