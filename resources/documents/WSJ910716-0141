Sullivan saidthat self-policing by physicians and dentists -- and notmandatory AIDS testing -- is the best way to protect patientsfrom health-care workers who might be infected with the AIDSvirus.   The recommendation is the government's long-awaitedresponse to increasing public concerns that health-careworkers may be transmitting the human immune deficiency virusto patients.</LP><TEXT>   The Centers for Disease Control last July reported thefirst instance of a health professional, a Florida dentist,infecting a patient. In the intervening months, reports offour more infected patients of the dentist, along with newsstories in a half-dozen states about physicians and dentistswith AIDS who continued to practice their craft, have sparkeddemands for new practice guidelines for medical providers.   The guidelines, drafted by the Atlanta-based CDC, urge allhealth-care workers who perform exposure-prone procedures --those in which workers might be cut and have their blood comein contact with a patient -- to undergo AIDS testing. If thehealth-care worker tests positive, the guidelines recommendthat he or she stop performing those procedures, unlesspermission is received from both a medical review committeeand the patient.   Dr. Sullivan stopped short of calling for mandatory AIDStesting, noting that &quot;in the overwhelming number of medicalencounters, we simply don't need to be worried about AIDStransmission.&quot; Indeed, the Florida cases remain the onlyreported instances of an infected medical providertransmitting the HIV virus to a patient. And of the more than150,000 people diagnosed with acquired immune deficiencysyndrome in the U.S. since 1981, only about 4%, or about5,800 people, have been health-care workers.   While the CDC's recommendations aren't binding on themedical community, its guidelines often carry considerableweight with federal and state regulators.   The medical community, which has strongly opposedmandatory testing, generally applauded the CDC'srecommendations yesterday. William Schaffner, chairman of thedepartment of preventive medicine at Vanderbilt University inNashville, Tenn., called the guidelines &quot;exceedingly sound,&quot;adding that they should &quot;go a long way toward reassuring thepublic.&quot;   The American Medical Association, in a statement, said itwas &quot;pleased&quot; that the guidelines had been issued and said itwould work &quot;vigorously&quot; to implement them. In January, theAMA urged physicians who are already infected by the AIDSvirus to abandon surgery, unless they have patient consent.The AMA also urged physicians &quot;who are at risk of acquiringHIV infection&quot; to undergo testing, but it didn't go so far asto call for voluntary testing of all physicians who areinvolved in &quot;exposure-prone&quot; procedures.   The new guidelines, however, met with some criticism atboth ends of the spectrum. Rep. William Dannemeyer ofCalifornia, the ranking Republican on the House Energy andCommerce Health Subcommittee, dismissed the recommendationsas not going far enough. Mr. Dannemeyer, who has introducedlegislation calling for mandatory AIDS testing of physicians,said the guidelines &quot;continue a failed policy ofvolunteerism.&quot; Citing the plight of the five patients inFlorida who contracted the AIDS virus from their dentist, heasked: &quot;Why do the civil rights of the infected takeprecedence over the civil rights of the uninfected?&quot;   By contrast, Benjamin Schatz, who directs a program forinfected health-care workers sponsored by the AmericanAssociation of Physicians for Human Rights in San Francisco,said the guidelines go too far. &quot;It's nonsense to pretendthat, once physicians notify patients of their HIV status,they can continue to practice,&quot; he said. The recommendations,he added, actually give health-care workers a &quot;greaterincentive not to know their HIV status. If they find out it'spositive, they're under an ethical obligation to quit.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
