His focus on &quot;money demand&quot; and price stability in Federal Reserve monetary policy is right on target. Yet he missed the mark on his beliefs that money has no &quot;cost&quot; and interest rates are the &quot;price&quot; of money.    Money serves as a store of value and competes with other assets. As a medium of exchange, money facilitates market transactions. Since money is exchanged for goods and services, the relevant price of money is the exchange ratio between money and goods. Monetary disturbances result in changes in the price of money in terms of goods. Therefore, excess money creation leads to rising expectations of inflation, a higher price level and higher nominal interest rates. According to this view, increased economic activity results in increased money demand and lower prices, lower expectations of inflation and lower interest rates.    My view argues that the price of money in terms of goods is fixed in the short run leaving the asset price of money to equilibrate disturbances to the money market.    The experience of the U.S. during the past two decades shows that increases in economic activity are associated with lower inflation and interest rates. By contrast, excess money creation results in higher inflation and interest rates. These observations support the view that inflation is a monetary phenomenon and that the relevant focus of monetary analysis is the price of money in terms of goods.    Douglas C. MacLellan   Vice President   A.B. Laffer Associates   Lomita, Calif.   ---   Mr. MacDonald's piece contains a fundamental error. His thesis is that by fixing the &quot;price of money,&quot; a gold standard would minimize &quot;surprise and disturbance to productive activity.&quot; He bases his argument on the standard &quot;money demand&quot; graph showing the relationship between the demand (and supply) of money on the one hand and interest rates on the other.    His error is that the gold standard would not fix the &quot;price&quot; of money he has shown on the graph -- i.e. the interest rate. Instead, it would only fix the price of dollars relative to other currencies, or the exchange rate. Many different interest rates (real or nominal) can be compatible with a single exchange rate, depending on the asset preferences of investors in different markets and the trade balances in different countries. For example, in the first quarter of 1987 the nominal value of the dollar was virtually the same as it was, on average, for calendar year 1973 (on a multilateral trade-weighted basis for 10 key currencies). Yet Treasury-bill rates in the first quarter of 1987 averaged about 5.5% vs. 7% for 1973.    In short, if monetary policy makers want to adhere to a gold standard or any other fixed exchange rate regime, they must be prepared to vary the amount of money in the system to meet the constantly shifting demands of both domestic and foreign investors. But in fixing the exchange rate, policy makers will have given up control over interest rates -- or the variable Mr. MacDonald thinks is so essential for economic stability.    Better that we quit deluding ourselves into thinking that a gold standard will cure our economic difficulties. To the contrary, a gold standard would place the U.S. and the rest of the world in an economic straitjacket that would constrain growth and run the risk of throwing the world economy into a serious recession.
