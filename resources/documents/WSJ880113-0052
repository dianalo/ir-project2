The Salt Lake City-based software company said the reassessment could result in a charge of up to $3 million for the 1987 fourth quarter.    The company said it is reviewing the accounting treatment of software development costs during 1986 and 1987. The dispute is over whether the costs should be capitalized, or taken over a number of quarters, or expensed, that is, taken all at once. Fred Zirkle, president, said the SEC contacted the company because its auditors issued a qualified opinion in prior financial statements over whether the company could recover certain costs from future revenue.    Automated Language Processing Systems said it expects to release its 1987 year-end results in March. </TEXT></DOC>
