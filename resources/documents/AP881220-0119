The strike call for Dec. 24 and Jan. 6 follows a dispute betweenauthorities and local Palestinian officials over whether Christmascelebrations would be held this year in the biblical city ofBethlehem during the Arab uprising against Israeli occupation.   The army, meanwhile, reported it demolished three houses andsealed a fourth Tuesday in the occupied West Bank, saying the housesbelonged to members of a gang who attacked an Israeli civilian and apoliceman.   Three Palestinians were wounded during clashes between soldiersand stone-throwing youths in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Arabhospital sources said.   The call for general strikes was issued in a leaflet distributedin the West Bank and signed by the PLO-backed leaders of theyearlong Palestinian uprising.   The leaflet called for strikes ``as a rejection of the occupationand a rejection of any Israeli participation in the Christmascelebration.''   It urged Palestinian stores, which have been open only from 9a.m. to noon during much of the uprising, to remain open all day onDec. 23 and Jan. 5 ``so our Christian brothers can buy what theyneed.''   Distribution of the leaflet came as Israeli officials disputedstatements by Bethlehem Mayor Elias Freij that Christmascelebrations would be curtailed this year because of the``intefadeh,'' the Arabic word for uprising.   Israeli tourism officials put out statements saying that theusual choir concert would be held in Manger Square, adjacent to theChurch of the Nativity, which contains the grotto where Christ wasborn.   On Tuesday, Israeli soldiers put up decorative Christmas lightsand a sign saying ``Merry Xmas and Happy New Year'' on the road toBethlehem and were constructing a stage for the concert in MangerSquare.   Freij, a Christian Palestinian, had announced that no lightedChristmas tree would be displayed in the square this year and boyscouts would not take part in the traditional parade with churchleaders.   He said this was because many West Bank residents did not feellike celebrating after the yearlong uprising in which more than 330Palestinians have been killed, nine of them from the Bethlehem area.Thirteen Israelis also have died.   Bethlehem, once a small town populated mostly by PalestinianChristians, now has a population of about 35,000, many of themMoslems displaced by the founding of Israel in 1948.   The leaflet also called for two other general strikes in lateDecember and early January.   It praised the United States for announcing last week it wouldopen a dialogue with the PLO, calling the U.S. move ``a victory forthe intefadeh.'' The leaflet also urged carrying on with theuprising ``as a national duty.''   ``We must double our efforts ... so we can strike against theoccupation army,'' it said.   An army announcement Tuesday said soldiers demolished threehouses and sealed one in the West Bank town of Jenin and the nearbyvillage of Beit Qad after uncovering a gang of 14 members whocarried out attacks on Israelis.   The houses belonged to four members of the gang who played amajor role in violence, which included the stabbing of an Israelicivilian and an attack on a policeman, the army said.   An army spokesman said he did not know if all the members of thegang had been arrested or if any of them had been charged withcrimes or tried.   Israeli troops also raided at least four villages in the WestBank, forcing residents to paint over anti-Israeli graffiti,destroying olive groves and conducting searches for suspects, Arabreports said.   An army spokesman said troops carried out some raids onPalestinian villages Tuesday, but he could not give the number orexact location. He said no arrests were made.   The spokesman confirmed a youth was shot by troops who fired onstone-throwers in the Askar refugee camp near Nablus, the WestBank's largest city. He said he was checking the reports of otherinjuries.   Hospital officials said a 15-year-old was suffered a bullet woundin the buttocks in a clash with soldiers in the West Bank village ofAin Arik and another youth was shot in the Shati refugee camp in theGaza Strip.   The clash in Ain Arik, near Ramallah, erupted after Israelitroops brought in bulldozers to destroy groves of olive and lemontrees that youths used as cover to throw stones at passing Israelibuses, Arab reports said.</TEXT></DOC>
