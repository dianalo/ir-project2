 Hp's press conference included blessings from Ray Noorda, thepresident and CEO of Novell; Mike Murray, the general manager of Microsoft'sNetwork Business Unit; and Bruce Grant, Microage's vice president oftechnical support.andP;  There has been a recent flurry of vendors announcingproducts based on the 10 Baset Draft 10, which the IEEE is x standardize inSeptember.andM;Hp's Ethertwist line has seven components: two hubs, two adapter cards,network management software, an external transceiver, and a wire tester.andO;According to Carolyn Ticknor, the general manager of the HP RosevilleNetworks Division, EtherTwist was designed for the reseller-simplicity wasforemost in the minds of the engineers.andM;Robert Frankenberg, the general manager of HP Information Networks Group,explained that PCs that are being connected into LANS.andP;  According to themarket research firm International Data Corporation (IDC), in 1988 there were41 million PCs, but only 15 percent were networked.andP;  By 1992, the number ofPCs is projected to grow to 92 million.andP;  Of that, 50 percent will benetworked, says IDC.andP;  Because of the lower costs of adds, moves, and changesassociated with unshielded twisted pair than with other cabling types, HPdecided to move in that direction.andP;  If a company is using a PBX for itstelephone system, chances are there is unused, unshielded, twisted-pairtelephone wire that is suitable for data transmission.andM;&quot;The reseller channel has dominated,&quot; says Frankenberg.andP;  &quot;It is poised forexplosive growth.&quot; Most end user companies prefer to purchase their LANcomponents from VARS or computer retailers, rather than a manufacturer'sdirect sales force.andP;  According to a Computer Intelligence market report, 54percent of customers with 500 or more employees buy PC LANS through areseller.andP;  Of that group, 30 percent buy directly from the manufacturer, 16percent buy through a corporate or central organization, and 6 percent use acombined source.andM;HP, a company that traditionally sells through a direct sales force will usethe reseller channel as its primary distribution method.andP;  Frankenbergexplained that HP would &quot;join rather than fight the multivendor battle.&quot;andO;However, 20 percent of the Ethertwist sales effort will be through Hp'sdirect force, according to Frankenberg.andM;Ethertwist replaces Hp's Starlan 10, which is an implementation of unshieldedtwisted pair Ethernet that will not be compatible with the upcoming IEEEstandard.andP;  Still, HP has build in backwards compatibility with Starlan 10.andM;Ticknor likened the hub to a component stereo system.andP;  The hub &quot;is the mosteconomic solution for the broadest range of customers,&quot; she says.andP;  TheEthertwist line contains two 12-port modular hubs.andP;  The Ethertwist Hub Plushas the ability to be managed; the Ethertwist Hub does not.andP;  Up to 32 hubscan be cascaded through a BNC connector to support more than 1,000 users.andP;  A50-pin connector allows the direct plug-in of a 25-pair bundle of twistedpair.andP;  Or a modular adapter with 12 jacks can plug into the 50-pin connector.andO;An AUI port allows for the connection of coaxial or fiber optic cabling.andP;  Thehubs can be wall mounted or rack mounted.andP;  A card cage is not required,thereby providing a low-cost entry point.andM;The HP OpenView Hub Manager software is on based on NewWave, the company'sgraphical user interface.andP;  Openview Hub Manager is a key element since HPclaims it is providing the lowest cost 10baseT or Token Ring solution of anyvendor, if the price of network management is included.andP;  OpenView Hub Managerallows network administrators to monitor network access and control HubPluses, whether they are local or remote.andP;  Features include real-time,color-coded mapping of the network layout, user-definable parameters foralarms, and the ability to enable and disable hub ports.andP;  In its firstrelease, the network administrator must draw the network map manually;however, in future releases, the software will draw the map automatically.andO;The software runs on a DOS PC with Microsoft Windows.andM;Rounding out the product line is the EtherTwist Medium-attachment Unit (MAU)or external transceiver, the EthertWist PC Link 8-bit adapter, and theEtherTwist Micro Channel Link adapter.andP;  Drivers are available for LAN ManagerUNIX, OS/2 LAN Manager, and Netware.andM;The wire tester evaluates the quality of twisted pair wire, determining if itEthernet traffic can run on it successfully.andP;  The same wire tester canevaluate a 25-pair bundle as well as individual four-pairs of twisted pair.andO;it tests for key parameters for a 10baseT network, including crosstalkattenuation, signal attenuation, burst noise, and continuity.andP;  The wiretester is a 10 pound portable unit.andM;The EtherTwist Hub costs $1,899; the Hub Plus costs $2,299.andP;  The OpenView HubManager software costs $1,499.andP;  The PC Link adapter costs $445; the MicroChannel Link card costs $595.andP;  The  external transceiver costs $159.andP;  The wire test instrument costs $9,500.andP;  All products shipped in April.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
