In a Securities and Exchange Commission filing, Insilco said at least two unidentified parties had suggested they were willing to pay $30 a share or more -- offers that topped First Boston's $724 million, or $29 a share, bid. But Insilco directors, in the face of a deadline imposed by First Boston, declined to pursue the possibility and agreed to be acquired by the First Boston group.    Nonetheless, Insilco, a maker of paint and Rolodex desk-top filers, among other things, said yesterday that it was furnishing confidential financial information to groups who approached it in the last week about the possibility of a takeover.    The Insilco filing affords a glimpse of many of the pressures and quandaries companies can undergo when considering a management-led leveraged buy-out. For instance, the Meriden, Conn.-based concern disclosed that when its stock price began rising during the thick of these negotiations, it issued a statement saying it had no news to explain the stock activity.    Malcolm Todt, Insilco's treasurer, declined to elaborate on the filing or the reasons for the board's actions. The directors' decision to go with First Boston could open the board to shareholder lawsuits.    Arthur Fleischer, a New York attorney representing a committee of Insilco's outside directors, defended the board's action and suggested the expressions of interest were not definite. Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., the investment banker representing the committee, told directors the $29-a-share price was fair and at the upper end of the range of acceptable prices, Mr. Fleischer said.    &quot;From the directors' point of view, the question was whether they accept an offer which was found to be fair, which was at the high end of the range of fairness and under an expressed deadline, or whether they follow up on indications of interest from people that may or may not have resulted in offers,&quot; Mr. Fleischer said.    The Insilco board's dilemma followed weeks of detailed talks in which First Boston sometimes used hardball tactics designed to reduce the possibility of a competing buyer. The talks began in early May between Insilco's chairman, Donald J. Harper, and First Boston, the company's longtime investment banker.    After a special committee of board members was formed to review the buyout process, directors decided not to solicit competing bids &quot;in view of the possible adverse consequences&quot; and based on the uncertainty that a management buy-out proposal would ultimately surface, according to the SEC filing.    By the end of July, First Boston presented the committee with a $28.50-a-share buy-out proposal. It also presented a proposal in which the group would receive an option to buy as much as 25% of Insilco's stock under certain circumstances if the company were to be taken over by a third party. The board told First Boston that the stock option proposal, on top of various termination fees and expense payments in the merger proposal, was &quot;unacceptable.&quot;    On Aug. 2, after unusual activity in Insilco's stock, the company announced that it had &quot;no news&quot; to account for the rise in its stock price. But hours later, after the close of trading, it disclosed that management was considering making a leveraged buy-out proposal. It said there was no assurance such an offer would be made.    The next day, Insilco's special committee met and received from the First Boston group a detailed buy-out proposal, including commitment letters from various lenders and investors for all the debt and equity financing necessary for the buy-out. The proposal called for Insilco to reimburse the group for as much as $20 million in expenses plus an additional $19 million under certain circumstances if the company was taken over by a third party.    Directors listened to a detailed analysis by Goldman Sachs of the buy-out and certain alternatives, including a tax-free spinoff of its Rolodex division and a recapitalization plan involving a one-time payment of $25 a share to shareholders.    In addition, Goldman told directors it had been approached by three parties interested in exploring the possibility of a merger. According to the filing, two groups suggested they might be willing to pay prices higher than the First Boston group was offering: One cited the &quot;$27 to $30 range,&quot; another &quot;the $30 to $31 range.&quot;    Insilco didn't disclose the identity of those parties. But in a presentation to directors, Goldman Sachs suggested at least six possible buyers for Insilco: the leveraged buy-out firms Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. and Forstmann Little andamp; Co., a pair of British firms, BTR PLC and Hanson PLC, as well as Mark IV Industries and Nortek Inc. It couldn't be learned yesterday whether any of those concerns expressed interest in Insilco.    After a discussion, the special committee contacted First Boston concerning &quot;various major issues.&quot; First Boston then raised its price to $29 a share and agreed to reduce the expense reimbursement to $15 million and the termination fee to $10 million if directors accepted its offer by 8 a.m. the next morning. They did.    &quot;By accepting the offer at a price that was found to be fair, the board is setting the floor, even though certain determinations were granted,&quot; argued Mr. Fleischer. &quot;If somebody wants to bid more than $29, they still can. The best test of the process is what happens now.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Insilco shares closed at $29.375, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
