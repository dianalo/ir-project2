A major roadblock to getting the bill to the Senate floor was cleared when Senate tax writers began preparing a package of amendments sought by several members. There were a few senators, however, who were still threatening to delay the bill over particular provisions.    A revised revenue estimate on one tax increase approved by the Senate Finance Committee bill gave the tax writers about $386 million in additional revenue over three years. Last night, the Finance Committee was seeing if this additional revenue could be used to pay for some of the more than 100 amendments senators were threatening to offer on the floor. If the sponsors of at least some of these amendments aren't appeased, the tax bill could get bogged down on the Senate floor in the final days of this legislative session.    The new revenue would come from a revision in the taxes to be raised by restricting the sale of tax breaks by Alaskan native corporations.    The Ways and Means Committee voted unanimously to go to a House-Senate conference on tax legislation. The vote was designed to show that it wouldn't merely accept a smaller tax bill it feared the Senate was moving toward.    In recent days, the Finance Committee has had difficulty getting the tax bill to the Senate floor, and there was some discussion of trying to pass a very small bill that would do little more than correct technical mistakes in the 1986 tax-overhaul law and relax the system for collecting the diesel-fuel tax from farmers.    The outlook began changing, however, when the Finance Committee got the new revenue to pay for some amendments, and when House and Senate leaders agreed to stay in session until next week. If Congress had adjourned this week as originally planned, there wouldn't have been enough time to pass a bigger tax package.    Last night, the Finance Committee was planning to bring up a bill that, in addition to making the technical corrections, would raise $2.3 billion over three years and extend some expiring tax breaks, such as the research-and-development tax credit. The tax increases would come from an acceleration in corporate estimated tax payments, curbs on life insurance policies that can serve as tax shelters and the Alaskan native corporation restrictions.    If approved by the Senate, the bill would have to be reconciled with a House-passed bill that would raise $7.1 billion over three years. Because the House bill passed by a huge, 380-25 margin, Ways and Means Chairman Dan Rostenkowski (D., Ill.) is expected to resist any bill that is much smaller. </TEXT></DOC>
