Analysts say the undecided voters are mainly supporters ofPresident Raul Alfonsin's Radical Civil Union angry at five years ofeconomic stagnation and social unrest; Peronists unhappy with theirparty's candidate, the center-right Carlos Menem; and center-leftvoters who feel none of the candidates speak for them.   ``I don't feel represented by any of them,'' said VirginiaDardalla Rute, 33, the owner of a small public relations company.``None of them will make a good president.''   Real estate agent Sandra Reymann, 25, voted for Alfonsin in 1983but has been disappointed and would rather not vote for a Radical inthese elections, set for May 14. But at the same time, she wouldnever vote Peronist or socialist and doesn't think a conservativecould win.   ``I'm not uninformed,'' Miss Reymann said. ``I read the papers. Ilisten to the radio.'' But no candidate stands out, she said, andthe ballot she casts _ voting is mandatory in Argentina _ may beblank.   At state in the elections are the presidency, some Senate seats,half the House of Deputies, and provincial legislatures.   Three surveys conducted over the past two months have putundecided voters at 39 percent, 32 percent and 32.5 percent.   Menem is 7 to 10 points ahead of the Radicals' Eduardo Angeloz inthose polls and others, but the gap has narrowed considerably.Alvaro Alsogaray of the rightist Democratic Center Union trails adistant third, followed by Nestor Vicente of the United Left.   Under the constitution, Alfonsin cannot seek a second consecutiveterm.   Menem and Angeloz, both provincial governors and lawyers, havetraversed the country and made the requisite swing through Europe todemonstrate their statesmenship abilities.   Positions have been staked out on how to restart the economy,balance the budget, curtail urban crime, provide housing, pay theforeign debt, and ease relations between the military and humanrights groups.   Menem, 53, and Angeloz, 57, are both center-right, but theirparties are movements that defy political labeling. Their parties,along with the armed forces, have provided Argentina's presidentsfor most of this century.   Menem has tried to play down the Peronists' ``black legend'' ofviolence and administrative incompetence, which preceded militarycoups in 1955 and 1976. The latter has tried to distance himselffrom an unpopular government without losing the support of Alfonsin,a veteran campaigner, and resources like access to state media.   Now and again, the two snipe at one another. Angelos says Menem'sproposals are ``simplistic.'' Menem says Angelos represents agovernment ``that fulfilled only 5 percent of what it promised.''   But each for the moment seems more interested in polishing hisown public image _ Menem as the charismatic champion of organizedlabor and the downtrodden, and Angeloz as the honest administratorand family man _ than in demolishing the other.   ``I won't let you down'' is the slogan on Menem posters, whichshow the candidate with his hair to his shoulders and sideburnscovering most of his cheeks.   ``It can be done!'' is Angeloz's slogan. He usually appears onposters and in person in a blue blazer and open-necked shirt,wearing thick-framed black glasses and a broad smile.   Vicente, a lawyer and several times a losing candidate for theHouse of Deputies, lacks a nationwide constituency and is littleknown outside the capital. What he really is aiming to do isincrease the number of leftist legislators in Congress.   Alsogaray, for the same reasons, has little chance of winning.But the 75-year-old military engineer and former economy ministerand ambassador to the United States is a potential kingmaker.   In a scenario that frustrates Menem and makes Angeloz credibledespite any poll, no candidate will win enough votes to guaranteevictory in the Electoral College, and the 600 electors pick apresident, or failing to do that, pass the decision onto Congress.   In either case, the conservative Alsogaray may trade his electorsfor political concessions, and his party has much more in commonwith the Radicals than the Peronists.   In 1983, Alsogaray supported Alfonsin, reluctantly, to prevent aPeronist victory.   Angeloz and Alsogaray insist their electors will vote for them.More importantly, both have rejected Peronist suggestions that therunners-up support the candidate who gets the most votes.   Maria Julia Alsogaray, a national deputy and key adviser to herfather, in an interview published in the Buenos Aires Heraldacknowledged that in the end, either in the Electoral College orCongress, her party might provide the winning margin.   She set no specific concessions the party would demand butinsisted that ``any candidate wishing to get our votes would have toadhere'' to the party's platform, which calls for the privatizationof state industries and minimal government, among other things.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, March 8</NOTE></DOC>
