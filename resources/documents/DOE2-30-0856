<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-30-0856 </DOCNO><TEXT>A digitally controlled analog phase shifter is described for the applicationin magnetic resonance (MR) imaging and spectroscopy. The design is basedon a single side band modulator scheme. A phase resolution of 1.4{sup0} and a switching time of 400 ns are achieved. The device controls thephase of the intermediate frequency in the MR instrument, and hence canbe used over the entire observe frequency range of interest.</TEXT></DOC>
