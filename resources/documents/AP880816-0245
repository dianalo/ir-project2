Dan Quayle has made his reputation in theSenate as one of the chamber's most ardent supporters of PresidentReagan's Pentagon build-up and a master of the minutiae of armscontrol and defense policy.   In fact, the man picked Tuesday by George Bush as the Republicanvice-presidential candidate broke with moderate Republicans lastmonth and advised Reagan to veto a Pentagon budget bill. Reagan didjust that, citing _ as did Quayle _ the deep reductions in StarWars spending.   The junior senator from Indiana also was one of the leaders in abitter 1986 Senate fight over Daniel Manion, a conservative Indianalawyer whose judicial nomination became a battleground overReagan's judicial philosophies.   In addition, Quayle is on the Senate Labor Committee, where hehas spearheaded the Reagan administration's fight against raisingthe minimum wage, providing advance notice of plant closings andother labor legislation backed by unions.   Even after Senate conservatives, the White House and majorbusiness groups dropped their opposition to some labor-backedmeasures such as a ban on the use of lie detectors to screen jobapplicants, Quayle remained a vehement foe.   Quayle, elected to the Senate in 1980, has specialized inmilitary issues as a member of the Armed Services Committee. Headmitted he had little knowledge about the issue before coming tothe Senate, but said he had made up for that by spending long hoursporing over the arcane details of military policy, such as troopstrength, weapons performance, and Soviet military doctrine.   Quayle is now ranking Republican on the conventional force andallied defense subcommittee, a panel which deals chiefly with the16-member North Atlantic Treaty Organization.   Last winter, Quayle was one of the leading skeptics during thelong Senate debate over the historic Intermediate-range NuclearForces treaty, the U.S.-Soviet pact which eliminates medium- andshort-range atomic-tipped missiles.   Quayle was one of the few senators on the Armed Services panelwho attended virtually the entire series of hearings, including anumber of long, detailed sessions devoted to taking testimony frommilitary officers and think-tank experts about the possible effectof the INF pact on Western Europe.   Before the hearings began, Quayle said he was skeptical aboutthe pact, even though it had been negotiated by a conservativepresident he admired. But he eventually ended up voting for it onMarch 27 when the Senate ratified the pact by a 93-5 margin.   Many of his questions centered on the issue of whether the pactwould ban so-called ``futuristic'' weapons of the type envisionedby Reagan's 5-year-old Strategic Defense Initiative, the formalname of Star Wars.   Quayle has been one of the Senate's leading champions of StarWars, and it was that advocacy which last month led him to suggestthat Reagan veto a defense bill providing for the Pentagon budgetfor the fiscal year starting Oct. 1.   Reagan wanted $4.8 billion next year for Star Wars, but thecompromise measure proposed by the Democratic-controlled Congressprovided $4.0 billion, a figure only slightly above the current$3.9 billion Star Wars budget.   On July 14, the Senate was preparing for final passage of thebill in a vote that would send it to Reagan's desk, but Quaylemoved to return it to a House-Senate conference committee so theStar Wars budget could be increased and Democratic-written armscontrol restrictions could be dropped.   ``This is a political struggle between the administration andthe Congress over who is going to run arms control policy, noquestion about it,'' explained Quayle.   Quayle told his Senate colleagues that Reagan might veto thebill, but other Republicans, such as Sen. John Warner of Virginia,ranking Republican on the Armed Services panel, said they had beentold the president would reluctantly sign the measure.   Quayle's move lost, 58-35, but he said afterwards that Reaganshould veto the measure and he was one of the first senators topraise the president when Reagan did reject the bill on Aug. 3.Quayle described Reagan's veto as ``a good, sound decision.''   Quayle was also involved in the fight over Manion, who had beenappointed by Reagan to a federal appeals court in Chicago.Opponents said Manion was unqualified, but Republicans said he wasbeing criticized only because of his conservative ideology.   Manion, a son of the founder of the John Birch Society, hadreceived a ``qualified'' rating from the American Bar Association,the lowest passing grade given by the ABA's judicial screeningpanel.   Manion was eventually confirmed, 50-49, on a tie-breaking votecast by Bush in his vice-presidential role as presiding officer ofthe Senate.</TEXT></DOC>
