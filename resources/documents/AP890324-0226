(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A suspended Navy official faces up to 25years in prison for bribery in the Pentagon purchasing scandal, anda company that profited from his inside information will pay morethan $4.3 million in fines.   Stuart E. Berlin admitted on Thursday that he accepted a bribe toprovide inside information on a $24 million contract eventuallyawarded to Teledyne Electronics of Newbury Park, Calif., a divisionof Teledyne Industries Inc.   Teledyne Industries Inc. pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraudthe United States and two counts of making false statements to thegovernment, and agreed to pay $1.5 million in penalties, $2 millionin civil claims and $786,000 to reimburse the government for thecost of the investigation.   In addition, Teledyne agreed to give up its negotiated 13.5percent profit on the contract that could result in a savings to thegovernment of $4 million over the next three years, the JusticeDepartment said.   Berlin, 51, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud the UnitedStates, to commit bribery, wire fraud and filing false statements,as well as receiving a bribe as a government official and wire fraud.   U.S. District Judge Claude Hylton set sentencing for June 2, whenBerlin could face up to 25 years in prison and fines of up to$750,000. Berlin made no comment as he left the courtroom.   As part of his plea agreement, Berlin also will cooperate withprosecutors in the continuing ``Ill Wind'' investigation, includingthe trial of his former co-defendants in the indictment.   Those defendants in the trial scheduled to begin April 3 aredefense consultants Fred H. Lackner and William L. Parkin, as wellas three Teledyne officials: George H. Kaub, Eugene R. Sullivan andDale Schnittjer. Parkin was hospitalized last Friday afterreportedly taking an overdose of pills.   With Thursday's action, the more than 2-year-old investigationhas resulted in a dozen guilty pleas that have been publiclyrevealed, said Assistant U.S. Attorney Joseph J. Aronica.   He refused to say whether other people or companies underinvestigation already have agreed to plead guilty.   Aronica also would not disclose how extensively Berlin'stestimony might be used against other defendants, saying only, ``Thetotal investigation is moving along very quickly.''   As part of the plea agreements, prosecutors dismissed counts ofbribery and wire fraud against Berlin and Teledyne. Racketeeringcharges had been dropped at an earlier court hearing.   Teledyne said in a statement that it decided to enter the pleaarrangement primarily due to ``the recognition that a formeremployee, Michael Savaides, had entered into a corrupt and illegalarrangement with William Parkin, a consultant to TeledyneElectronics, and Fred Lackner, with whom the company had norelationship.''   ``Their purpose was to subvert the lawful operation of thegovernment's procurement process,'' the company said. Savaides haspleaded guilty and is awaiting sentencing.   Berlin had been a supervisory electronics engineer and branchhead of the ship systems engineering section at the Space and NavalWarfare Systems Command in Arlington, Va., when the actions occurred.   The Justice Department said Berlin received about $1,000 everyfew months from Parkin and Lackner in exchange for giving themclassified documents. The indictment said the consultants weregetting their information from Berlin.   He was reassigned to a non-procurement job in June 1988, when theinvestigation became public, and he was suspended without payshortly after he was indicted in January.   The Navy will review his plea agreement before deciding onBerlin's employment status, said Lt. Bruce Cole, a Navy spokesman.   The Pentagon, meanwhile, is re-evaluating its suspension inJanuary of Teledyne Electronics from new contracts, but had made nodecision Thursday.   The $24 million contract at issue was for hand-held electronictesting equipment that checks whether radar transponders are workingbefore military airplanes are allowed to fly. The Mark 12 IFFtransponder test set checks the equipment that helps identifywhether a plane flying nearby is a friend or foe.   The Army, Navy and Air Force are using the equipment, and theNavy purchased the sets under a master Air Force contract. SinceJuly 1987, when Teledyne was awarded the contract, the Navy hasreceived 105 of the sets, and plans to buy 43 more this year.   The Pentagon's suspension of Teledyne Electronics did not affectthe contract already awarded.</TEXT></DOC>
