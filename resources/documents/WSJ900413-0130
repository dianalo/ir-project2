The managing director of MandarinOriental International Ltd. ticks off the tremors: threehotels affected by the June 4 killings in Beijing, one jarredby a coup attempt in Manila, the Philippines and one swayedby an earthquake in San Francisco.   The disturbances, however, didn't keep the hotel chain'sprofit from growing 12% last year to a record HK$392.8million (US$50.4 million). And Mandarin Oriental isn't theonly Hong Kong-based company continuing to prosper amidconcern that the local business environment is declining.</LP><TEXT>   Profits of most of the main companies listed on HongKong's stock exchange grew in 1989 for the fifth consecutiveyear, despite widespread worries that China's turmoil and thecolony's uncertain political future would damp corporateperformance. Two of Hong Kong's biggest conglomerates, CheungKong (Holdings) Ltd. and Jardine Matheson Holdings Ltd.,surprised analysts with profit increases of 33% and 42%,respectively.   In fact, the rate of profit growth for all companiesmaking up the Hang Seng index slowed only slightly from theprevious year, to 21% from 21.4%, according to a survey bybrokerage firm Hoare Govett Asia Ltd. And while those rateswere well off the breakneck pace of 1986 and 1987 earningsincreases, Hong Kong's economy was booming during the earlierperiod.   Analysts expect the colony's slowing economy and theconsolidation of past gains to lead to a significant drop inprofit growth this year. Hoare Govett projects a rise of only12% for Hang Seng-index companies in 1990. Even so, there isbroad agreement that local companies are performing well indifficult times.   &quot;If Hong Kong is that resilient and can survive June 4,maybe the risk of investing here isn't so high,&quot; saysChristopher Chong, an analyst at James Capel (Far East) Ltd.(The killings of demonstrators by Chinese troops in Beijingon June 4, 1989, caused a sharp deterioration in confidenceabout Hong Kong's future.)   The strength of the latest results could inspire new faithin many Hong Kong companies. Coming amid doubts that HongKong can continue to prosper when it returns to Chinesesovereignty in 1997, the corporate results may lift thespirits of international investors and local businessmen, andlend credence to analysts who have argued that politicalmeddling from Beijing won't directly affect businesses inHong Kong.   &quot;These results should show people that Hong Kong isn'tgoing to collapse overnight,&quot; says Victor Kwok, an analyst atElders Roach Asia Ltd.   Indeed, anticipation of strong profits helped the HangSeng index rise 5.7% in the first quarter, despite persistentturmoil in the New York and Tokyo markets. In the past, theHong Kong exchange usually has echoed sharp movements inthose major markets. The announcement of Jardine Matheson'sresults, for example, pushed the market up 1.6% in a singleday.   The Hong Kong market did, however, get jolted on Monday bya 6.6% drop in Tokyo's Nikkei average. The Hang Seng indexfell 63.28 points, or 2.1%   Hong Kong shares have long traded at prices well below thevalue of their underlying assets, largely because investorsregard the colony's future as uncertain. A shift in thatperception, or a so-called rerating of Hong Kong stocks,would probably lead to a sharp rise in share prices.   Not that there aren't several question marks hanging overHong Kong companies and the stock market. The flight ofskilled workers and managers is eroding the efficiency oflocal businesses. A shortage of manual labor is keeping wagesand inflation high and stifling some businesses' growth.Moreover, Hong Kong's economic growth slowed last year, andmany analysts believe corporate investment declined afterJune 4.   &quot;There won't be a significant improvement {in the stockmarket} until there are signs that the economy is turningaround,&quot; says Phillip Niem, research director at HoareGovett.   In the short term, the dull economy may cloud investors'perception of the stock market and keep down the share pricesof what many analysts regard as increasingly sound companies.Analysts argue that companies that stood up to 1989'sdifficulties aren't likely to crumble now.   &quot;What we're seeing is the success of two themes,&quot; saysNiall Shiner, an analyst at BT Brokerage Asia Ltd. &quot;Themovement to very high-quality earnings that can beindependent of the economy and an increase in internationalearnings.&quot;   Underlying the earnings growth of many big companies is ashift in strategy begun in the mid-1980s. For real-estatecompanies in particular, the change in focus from propertydevelopment, where profit depends on often-volatile prices,to retaining and renting out buildings is proving prudent.   &quot;Property-investment companies now make up 9% of the HangSeng index,&quot; says Stuart Cook, an analyst at BaringSecurities (Hong Kong) Ltd. &quot;Once a rental agreement issigned, the company isn't subject to these politicalhiccups.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
