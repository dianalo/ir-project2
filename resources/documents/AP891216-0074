Since then, the editor of the underground Lidove Noviny(People's Newspaper) has been released, and his life has beentransformed from that of a dissident journalist jailed fordefending civil liberties to head of a flourishing, legal biweekly.   Donations have been pouring in from all over the world to helpthe newspaper get on its feet, including a $10,000 grant from theParis-based Fund for Censorship, which groups six Western pressassociations.   The newspaper is founding a publishing house that will printmagazines and books, including an anthology of articles from LidoveNoviny in its samizdat days.   Since his release, Ruml has worked non-stop editing the nextedition of the newspaper, giving endless rounds of interviews toforeign journalists and attending countless political meetings.   ``I don't eat, I don't sleep, I just prepare Lidove Noviny,which at my age is not so easy,'' said Ruml, 64. ``But finally wecan do this and I will be leaving something good to the youngpeople who take over.''   Banned by the Communists, the underground newspaperclandestinely printed only 450 copies that circulated among about10,000 dissidents and supporters hungry for information, ratherthan the propaganda published in the official press.   More than 500,000 copies will be printed for distribution onWednesday, the first since the pro-democracy revolution endedCommunist domination of the government.   Among the first acts of the new opposition-approved governmentsworn in a week ago was the firing of the official state censor.   Now, even the Communist Party dailies Rude Pravo and Pravdacarry news. Instead of Pablum and propaganda, each day's pagesoffer reports on formerly taboo subjects like the secret police andcorruption in the highest party circles.   Only a month ago, editors made weekly visits to the CommunistParty press office to hear about the previous week's ``errors'' andreceive ``advice.''   Offensive passages were deleted, offensive publications wereconfiscated before they hit the street and some journalists whooperated too far from the party line, like those editing samizdatjournals, wound up behind bars.   All that is changing.   ``It will be a challenge,'' Ruml said, ``but I think we will besuccessful. The best writers will want to work for us.''   Many of the best writers in Czechoslovakia already have,including playwright Vaclav Havel, leader of the opposition CivicForum and the most popular man in Czechoslovakia. His article``Goodbye, Samizdat,'' will run on the front page ahead of Ruml'seditorial, ``Everything is different.''   Three weeks ago, Ruml was in his 6-foot-long cell at Ruzyniprison, awaiting trial on charges of acting ``out of hostilitytoward the socialist state.''   ``I was very isolated,'' he recalled. ``But on the night of the23rd I suddenly heard people shouting `Long live Charter 77' (anopposition group) and then I heard another person shout that Dubcekhad given a speech on Wenceslas Square. I knew something big hadhappened outside.''   The next day he exchanged cigarettes for a newspaper and readabout the enthusiastic welcome given Dubcek, leader of the ``PragueSpring'' reforms who was ousted and discredited after theSoviet-led invasion in 1968.   The newspaper also reported a ground-breaking meeting betweenthen Communist Premier Ladislav Adamec and members of thepro-democracy opposition, including Ruml's son.   ``So I thought to myself, if he can sit with Adamec, why shouldI be sitting in this jail. The next day I was out,'' he said.   Within hours he was addressing thousands of supporters outsidethe Laterna Magika Theatre (Magic Lantern), headquarters for theCivic Forum.   His paper, once shunned as the voice of hopeless dissidents,became the noble voice of the new Czechoslovakia.   ``We knew this would happen but it came sooner than expected.Still, it was long, long overdue.'</TEXT></DOC>
