Then there's a chubby Rottweiler dubbed Bubbette in thedog dryer.   They're all being primped and groomed by their owners at the``do-it-yourself dog wash.''   ``We think it's just a new lifestyle for dogs,'' said John Cole,58, who just opened the third Little Dipper Do-it-Yourself Pet CareCenter in Austin.

I learned some things about NewJersey _ it's worse than I thought.''   The Ragans _ he's a professor in special education and she is anEnglish Department lecturer _ call for New Jersey's 7 millionresidents to be relocated to the Plains. There would be fivemega-airports with rail service to nearby cities.   The buffalo idea was broached by Frank Popper, a Rutgers urbanstudies professor, and his wife, Deborah.</TEXT><DATELINE>LINCOLN, Neb.

Word of the Safedisk spread after television talk-show hostArsenio Hall tittered over them. The two plastic covers fit twosizes of floppy disks.   Stephen Nabity of Fremont _ ``Dr. Safedisk'' _ said he got theidea while watching a TV newscast about a predicted outbreak ofcomputer viruses on Friday, Oct. 13.   ``It came to me that people should practice safewhatever-they-do _ a lot of computer viruses were going around,''said Nabity, 33.   His product doesn't don't actually protect against computerviruses, but they can be an inexpensive stocking-stuffer _ at $7.95_ for computer buffs who can be hard to buy for, Nabity said.</TEXT></DOC>
