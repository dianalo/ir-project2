In testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Baker asserted that although &quot;we don't see a downtrend yet,&quot; the trade deficit apparently has stopped increasing. He predicted the gap will narrow modestly -- by about $20 billion -- this year from last year's $169.8 billion level.    At the same time, the Treasury chief said the U.S. &quot;will continue&quot; to prod West Germany and Japan to stimulate their economies so they can absorb a larger portion of world-wide exports. He warned that the only other ways to relieve global trade imbalances -- a recession in the U.S. or a far-greater decline in the dollar's value -- &quot;cannot be viewed lightly in the current international environment.&quot;    The Treasury secretary also called on newly industrializing countries to help by opening their markets and by allowing their currencies to rise to make U.S. goods more competitive. The currencies of some such countries already have appreciated substantially, and Mr. Baker said the U.S. is &quot;continuing&quot; talks with Taiwan and South Korea to persuade them to peg their currencies less closely to the dollar.    Mr. Baker's remarks came as, separately, the U.S. continued to press its offer to cooperate with West Germany and Japan in stabilizing exchange rates if those countries stimulate their economies. The U.S. still fell short yesterday of winning any new accord, though.    In fact, foreign-exchange traders got the impression from some of Mr. Baker's comments that such an accord may not be near. That weakened the dollar, though the U.S. currency managed to rise from Monday's levels.    In discussing efforts made toward greater international economic coordination, the Treasury secretary said: &quot;We will be building on these accomplishments in the year ahead, recognizing that each meeting will not produce an agreement and each agreement may not result in a major redirection of economic trends.&quot;    The Reagan administration has proposed that the so-called Group of Five countries establish &quot;reference ranges&quot; -- broad upper and lower limits for the dollar, the West German mark and the Japanese yen -- and then intervene in the foreign-exchange markets if their currencies approach those limits. The Group of Five includes the U.S., West Germany, Japan, Britain and France.    But the administration insists that West Germany and Japan stimulate their economies as part of the deal. So far, the allies -- West Germany, in particular -- have been unwilling to go along.    Mr. Baker wasn't asked during his testimony about the U.S. proposal, and later he refused to discuss it with reporters.    In his testimony, Mr. Baker took a conciliatory approach on trade issues, promising to cooperate in drafting a bill rather than opposing all trade legislation, as the administration did in 1986. &quot;Our strategy is different than it was last year, and that's no secret,&quot; he said.    At the same time, however, he warned Congress that the administration wouldn't accept trade legislation that included a general surcharge on imports, protection for a single industry such as textiles, provisions requiring mandatory retaliation against countries that have trade surpluses, or attempts to limit the president's discretion in negotiating with foreign governments or deciding whether to grant protection to domestic industries.    Mr. Baker once again attempted to sidestep questions about the value of the dollar. &quot;We're not trying to talk the dollar down,&quot; he told the committee.    In response to a question, Mr. Baker said he saw &quot;no evidence&quot; that the dollar's drop has had an adverse impact on the U.S. economy, either by exacerbating inflation or by impeding the government's ability to borrow from foreign investors.    At the same time, however, he warned that &quot;there is always a danger if the dollar declines too far, too fast.&quot; And he cautioned that &quot;at some point it becomes somewhat counterproductive&quot; to push the dollar down further, particularly if doing so weakens the West German and Japanese economies by cutting their exports too severely. He noted that the Japanese yen has risen sharply against the dollar since the U.S. currency peaked two years ago.    Mr. Baker continued to stress that the U.S.'s own budget deficit is &quot;a major factor&quot; in bloating the country's trade deficit. &quot;Anything we can do to reduce the fiscal deficit will help us with the trade deficit,&quot; he said.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.8153 marks, up from 1.8075 Monday. The U.S. unit also climbed to 153.43 Japanese yen, from 152.08.    The dollar got off to a flying start in Asian trading yesterday, based on reports of the U.S. offer to join in a currency-stabilization pact. After dipping on Mr. Baker's comments, the dollar got a boost from buying by speculators covering short, or oversold, positions in the currency.    However, the dollar is expected to resume its decline. &quot;The market still believes the dollar is going to go lower,&quot; said currency-market analyst Diego S. Giurleo, at Royal Bank of Canada, New York. He said a decline to 1.70 West German marks is possible for the dollar by the end of the month.    Douglas E. Hart II, a trader at Credit Suisse, New York, said &quot;A lot of people are reading between the lines of what Baker is saying and what you see in the market is the result.&quot; He added, &quot;By not supporting the dollar, or not talking the dollar up, the market is going to conclude that he wants the opposite, for the dollar to go down.&quot;    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for current delivery fell 90 cents an ounce to $403 in moderate trading. Volume was estimated at 3.2 million ounces.    ---   Charles W.
