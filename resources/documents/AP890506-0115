Clashes reached such an intensity that Palestinian youths usedmosque loudspeakers to urge residents to rush to hospitals andclinics to donate blood, Arab reports said.   The riots were concentrated in the Gaza Strip and broke out asMoslems celebrated the holiday of Eid al-Fitr, which marks the endof the holy month of Ramadan.   The army confirmed the three deaths and said 70 Palestinianswere wounded, all in Gaza. An army spokesman, speaking on conditionof anonymity, said Saturday was ``by far the worst'' day in theGaza Strip since the start of the Palestinian uprising.   He said Defense Minister Yitzhak Rabin visited Gaza toinvestigate the incidents.   The shooting was the heaviest since riots broke out after theassassination of PLO military chief Khalil Wazir in Tunis on April16, 1988. Fifteen Arabs were shot and killed and more than 90wounded as Palestinians rioted, blaming Israel for the murder.   The deaths Saturday raised to 465 the number of Palestinianskilled since the anti-Israeli uprising began in December 1987.Twenty Israelis have died.   The clashes began in the Nusseirat refugee camp as Palestinianworshipers were leaving a mosque after holiday prayers.   The day is traditionally celebrated with morning prayersfollowed by visits to cemeteries to memorialize lost relatives.   Arab reporters said worshipers left the mosque and beganchanting ``Allahu Akbar,'' Arabic for God is great, and throwingstones at about 100 Israeli soldiers outside.   The soldiers fired tear gas and later live ammunition at thedemonstrators and killed one.   The demonstrators carried the dead man to the cemetery, whichwas crowded with Arab families praying and decorating with flowersthe graves of relatives and Palestinians killed in the uprising.   As news of the shooting spread, Palestinians in the cemeterybegan to pelt soldiers with stones. The army called inreinforcements and used helicopters to drop tear gas on the nearly500 demonstrators, Arab reports said.   The second Palestinian was killed during the cemetery unrest.   Hospital officials identified the dead there as Muhammed AbdallaZakout, 40, and Muhammed Muenes, 20, and said both were killed bygunshot wounds to the head. They said 40 Palestinians were woundedin Nusseirat.   The army clamped a curfew on Nusseirat, confining the camp's29,000 residents to their homes.   Rioting quickly spread to other parts of the Gaza Strip. Innearby Khan Yunis, Arab hospital officials reported one Palestinianshot and killed and 53 wounded, including three in criticalcondition, who were transferred to Israeli hospitals.   They identified the slain Palestinian as 22-year-old Eid SalamehAbu Masoud and said he was fatally wounded in the chest.   Also in Khan Yunis, a Palestinian suspected of collaboratingwith Israeli authorities was found stabbed to death, Arab reporterssaid.   Arab reporters identified him as 27-year-old Hassan Handeek. Thearmy confirmed the death but said Handeek was a criminal and not acollaborator.   Clashes were also reported in the Bureij refugee camp where 11Palestinians were wounded and in the town of Beit Hanoun where nineArabs were wounded.   In scattered clashes throughut the area, another 22 Palestinianswere wounded by army gunfire, Arab hospital officials said.   In the occupied West Bank, two Palestinians were wounded,including an 8-year-old boy.   The United Nations Relief and Works agency in the Gaza Stripreported 96 Palestinians were treated in area hospitals for gunshotwounds.   An agency spokesman said 27 Arabs were treated for beatinginjuries and that 23 were registered in hospitals as suffering frominhaling tear gas. He said six Palestinians were transferred toIsraeli hospitals in critical condition.   The army's deputy chief of staff, Maj. Gen. Ehud Barak, saidIsrael can defeat Palestinian nationalists with ``determination,tenacity ... and the capability of adapting quickly.''   He said few soldiers preferred to serve in the occupied WestBank or Gaza Strip but said resources devoted to quelling the riotswere not sapping the army's physical or moral strength.</TEXT></DOC>
