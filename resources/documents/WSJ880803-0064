In an interview, U.S. Attorney Stanley Twardy Jr. said he asked the FBI to investigate &quot;any possible wrongdoing in this matter.&quot; He declined to elaborate or to say whether a grand jury had been impaneled.    The Connecticut inquiry is the first criminal investigation to be disclosed in the Business Week matter, which also is being investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission and major stock markets. Prepublication trading of stocks mentioned in certain Business Week articles at nine major securities firms has come under review. Three brokers at three separate firms in Connecticut and California have been fired or suspended in connection with the probe.    Separately, people familiar with the Business Week investigation identified the two R.R. Donnelley andamp; Sons Co. workers against whom the company took disciplinary action Monday. These people identified the worker fired at Donnelley's Old Saybrook, Conn., printing plant as William Sady, an assistant pressman. They also said the worker Donnelley suspended at its Torrance, Calif., plant was William Jackson, a technician. Mr. Sady couldn't be reached for comment, but his wife said he wouldn't have any. Mr. Jackson couldn't be reached for comment. Much of the trading under investigation has been tied to leaks from the two Donnelley plants, where Business Week is printed. </TEXT></DOC>
