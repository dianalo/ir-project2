Pat Swindall of Georgia.   The seven men are charged with laundering money they were toldwas the profit of a south Florida drug trafficker. The cashactually was supplied by an undercover IRS agent, according to theindictment.   The money laundering investigation has been under way since 1987and has so far resulted in 19 convictions in Baltimore, Atlanta,Tulsa, Okla.; Dallas; and San Juan, Puerto Rico; the IRS said in astatement.   Former Rep. Robert Hanrahan, R-Ill., has pleaded guilty toviolating currency laws, and last month Swindall was convicted of10 counts of lying to a grand jury about his involvement in thescheme.   The IRS sting also has nabbed attorneys, bankers and a formerNixon aide.   According to Friday's indictment, the seven Massachussets andConnecticut men tried to circumvent federal laws that require banksto report cash transactions of more than $10,000, dividing up moneyinto smaller sums, exchanging cash for checks, which they swappedamongst themselves, and buying insurance annuitites under fakenames.   Charges against them include conspiracy to defraud thegovernment of over $1 million, lying to the government and filingfalse currency reports.   Indicted were: Peter E. Knox, 42, of Littleton; Edmond P.LaFrance, 44, of Stoneham; Richard A. LaFrance, 51, of Acton;Alfred G. Maroun 57, of Boston; Donald J. Mackinnon, Jr., 55, ofBoston; William H. O'Leary, Sr., 65, of Westwood; and Frank S.Sottile, 60, of Simsbury, Ct.   Two Massachusetts businesses were also charged, Maroun Brothers,Inc., a food distributor in Lawrence, and FDM Corp., doing businessas Barnaby's restaurant in Littleton.   Reached at his business Friday, Maroun said the indictments cameas a total surprise.   He said he did not know any of the other defendants and hadnever met Charles LeChasney, an informant who has figured inseveral of the cases.   ``This is sort of a very odd situation,'' he said, referringother questions to his attorney.   Richard LaFrance said federal investigators had asked to examinehis books about a year and a half ago. ``They didn't really askanything, they just took the records and left,'' he said.   The other defendants could not be reached for comment. Knox andO`Leary were not listed in the telephone directory. Edmond LaFranceand Mackinnon did not return telephone calls to their homes, andcalls to Sottile's home went unanswered.   Prosecutor Patrick Walsh, a special attorney with the Departmentof Justice in Washington, said Edmond LaFrance was arrested, buthas not yet entered a plea. The others face arraignment next week,he said.   Walsh said the investigation in each city has relied on the sameundercover IRS agent posing as a front man for drug dealers, andthe same confidential informant.   An admitted con man convicted of money laundering, LeChasney,testified in June against Swindall and also figured in the caseagainst Robert C. Schultz, a Washington banker. Prosecutors saidSchultz advised LeChasney and Hanrahan on how to set up bankaccounts to shield money laundering activities. Schultz pleadedguilty and is to be sentenced Sept. 20.   Walsh would not comment on whether any of the New England menalso had dealings with LeChasney.   The indictment alleges that the defendants received commissionsof 6 percent to 8 percent on the money they laundered, and filteredthe money through more than a dozen Massachusetts and Connecticutbanks.</TEXT></DOC>
