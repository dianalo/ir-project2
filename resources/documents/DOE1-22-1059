<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-1059 </DOCNO><TEXT>We report on the observation and the analysis of collective magnetostaticspin-wave excitations in magnetic superlattices. The influence of interfaceanisotropies, which can become dominant for small modulation wavelengths,is discussed. For the system Fe/Pd we show that Brillouin spectroscopyexperiments in combination with the measurement of the saturation magnetizationby a SQUID magnetometer give evidence for a magnetic polarization ofthe Pd spacer layers, as well as for a small negative out-of-plane interfaceanisotropy constant of K/sub s/ = -0.15 erg/cm{sup 2}. 22 refs., 5 figs.,1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
