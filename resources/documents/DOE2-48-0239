Photons at this frequency are generated dueto parametric instability in the region with plasma density of one quarterof the critical one. Electron temperature may directly be calculatedfrom the spacing between two characteristic maxima, well identifiableon the line profile, while the Doppler shift of the line as a whole makesit possible to determine the hydrodynamic velocity of the plasma coronamotion.
