Introduction and Background </ITAG>Section 207(1) of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Amendmentsof 1988 requires OJJDP to submit an annual report to the President andCongress six months after the end of the fiscal year. The deadline forthe first report has been extended to August 1, 1989, with subsequent years'reports due by March 31st. This report must provide a detailed summary and analysis of the most recentavailable juvenile custody data regarding: The number and individual characteristicsof juveniles taken into custody; the rates at which they are taken intocustody; the number of juveniles who died while in custody and the circumstancesof their deaths. Section 207(1) specifically requires a detailed summary and analysis ofjuvenile custody data, presented <T3>separately </T3>for juvenile <T3>nonoffenders, status offenders, </T3>and <T3>delinquent offenders </T3>and by the <T3>type of facilities </T3>on the following measures: (a) The number of juveniles taken into custody; (b) The rate at which juveniles are taken into custody; (c) The trends demonstrated by the data, disaggregated by:<ITAG tagnum="15">_The types of offenses with which the juveniles are charged; </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The race and gender of the juveniles; and </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_The ages of the juveniles in custody.</ITAG>The report must provide this information for specified types of detentionand correctional facilities, including, but not limited to, secure detentionfacilities, secure correctional facilities, jails and lockups. Currentlythere are more than 11,000 facilities nationally that may hold juveniles(nonoffenders, status offenders and delinquent offenders) in custody, includingsecure juvenile detention and correctional facilities, state prisons, adultjails and lockups as well as other public and private juvenile custodyfacilities. It is estimated that together these facilities admit as manyas 800,000 juveniles into custody annually. While most facilities recordspecific demographic, legal and other information for administrative oroperational purposes, currently there is no mechanism to collect and synthesizethese data on a national level for research, policy or program developmentpurposes. Existing Federal surveys of these facilities which also collect data onthis population, provide little more than basic admission counts as a measureof the number of juveniles taken into custody. Details on characteristicsof the juveniles in custody collected in these facility surveys and censusesare usually limited to aggregate-level data for the resident populationon the date of the census and do not collect individual-level data. Statistical data which cannot distinguish the basic demographic and legalcharacteristics of juveniles taken into custody have limited utility forresearch (e.g., monitoring trends in the seriousness of juvenile delinquencyby race and ethnicity); for policy (e.g., addressing disproportionate representationof minorities in the juvenile justice system); or, for program development(e.g., developing services that address the specific needs of juvenilesin custody). The synthesis of existing data and the collection of new datasuch as that required by Congress should enhance the ability of policymakers, planners and practitioners to identify and respond to trends inthe field of juvenile justice. <ITAG tagnum="84">II. Research Goals and Objectives </ITAG>A. Research Goals The purpose of this Program of Research on Juveniles Taken into Custodyis to establish a program to document the number and characteristics ofjuveniles taken into custody by the juvenile and criminal justice system.It is expected that this initiative will result in more effective use ofexisting information and an expansion of knowledge about the juvenile justiceclient population. The immediate goals are to assist OJJDP in developinga short-term strategy to meet the reporting mandates of the Act and toestablish a system to efficiently collect the necessary information toproduce routine annual reports regarding the flow and characteristics ofjuveniles taken into custody. The long-term goal is to better understandthe characteristics and needs of this population so that the juvenile justicesystem can identify trends and respond effectively. B. Objectives The information required by the 1988 Amendments is not currently available.OJJDP has established the following objectives to produce the requiredinformation. The completion dates for these objectives are critical becausethey directly relate to the timely submission of reports to Congress andthe President. 1. To identify and conduct an analysis of existing Federal and State leveldata sets that provide information regarding the number of juveniles takeninto custody and the rate at which they are taken into custody. <T3>Completion date: </T3>June 30, 1989. 2. To develop a research design, including design of a survey instrumentto collect the necessary data for the annual report, a strategy for collectingthe data, and plans for analysis. 3. To provide the necessary programmatic support to the Census Bureau andtechnical assistance to the field during the data collection stage.4. To analyze data and prepare reports based on new juvenile custody surveyand existing data from relevant Federal, State and local sources for inclusionin the second annual report. <T3>Completion date: </T3>February 15, 1990. 5. To disseminate information about the program and its findings to a rangeof audiences through a variety of dissemination strategies. <T3>Completion date: </T3>July 31, 1990. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Research Design and Strategy </ITAG>OJJDP planning and program development activities are guided by a frameworkwhich includes four distinct programmatic phases: research, development,demonstration and dissemination. This is a research program. The purposeof the research phase is to develop new knowledge. The program will beconducted in three stages, consisting of: (1) Research design and instrumentation,(2) data collection and (3) data analysis and dissemination of findings.Project Advisory Board A project advisory board, consisting of survey methodologists, statisticians,data users and suppliers, practitioners and experts in juvenile justicepolicy, information systems and program management will be empaneled toprovide guidance to the program in carrying out its functions, reviewingplans and products. It is expected that there will be three advisory boardmeetings during the course of the program period. The applicant must specify the necessary qualifications of the advisoryboard members, roles and responsibilities, anticipated tasks and levelof compensation. The composition of the board must reflect an appropriatebalance of skills and expertise (both programmatic and technical) and havesufficient level of independence (ie: no conflict of interest) to effectivelyadvise the project. <ITAG tagnum="81">Stage I. Design and Instrumentation </ITAG>The research design and strategy developed for this program must be designedto identify existing information systems operating in the States that maymeet the statutory requirements of section 207(1). In order to avoid placingunnecessary demands on state and local resources in collecting new data,it is expected that the design effort will develop an approach that efficientlyutilizes existing data collection systems.
