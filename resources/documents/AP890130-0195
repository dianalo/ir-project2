Brown doesn't intend to lead theDemocratic Party as a symbol, although he'll be one _ or as aliberal, although he is one.   He is about to become the first black chairman of a nationalpolitical party and he vows to build the Democrats a campaignorganization that can help win the White House, something they havemanaged only once since 1964.   Brown is a sure thing to be elected chairman of the DemocraticNational Committee on Feb. 10 to succeed Paul G. Kirk Jr.   Brown, 47, an urbane lawyer-lobbyist with a lengthy politicalresume, says the chairman's job is not a pulpit for any ideology,left or right. He promises even-handed leadership at the nationalcommittee, especially when candidates begin lining up for the 1992presidential campaign.   One of them is likely to be Jesse Jackson, Brown's candidate in1988 when he served as convention manager for the black challengerto nominee Michael Dukakis. They are allies and friends, but Brownsays his new role will lead inevitably to differences.   ``I'm not looking to set up a fight to prove something,'' he saidin an interview. Brown said that when his new responsibilitiesrequire saying no to Jackson, that's what he'll do.   Setup or not, that will send a useful signal to his southern andconservative opponents, who insist that race is not a factor butthat Brown's liberal ties send the wrong message to the voters whohave chosen Republican presidents in four of the last five elections.   Again and again, Brown has pointed out that the Jackson campaignwas a 90-day assignment in a long political career. But it was themost visible, as he negotiated for Jackson in televised glare of theAtlanta convention, and it now is the one with which he is mostwidely identified.   Not that his earlier affiliations win points with the party'smore conservative wing. After working at the National Urban League,Brown served as a committee aide to Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, and as adeputy manager in the Massachusetts senator's losing bid for the1980 Democratic presidential nomination.   Kirk was Kennedy's campaign manager that year. There's no signthat Kennedy has reaped any benefits from the fact that one formeraide has been party chairman and another is about to take over thejob.   As chairman, Kirk made his mark with a relatively low profile. Heengineered the elimination of mid-term conventions, issuesconferences which had become forums for ideological warfare. He alsoended party recognition of special interest caucuses, calling thempolitical nonsense. Neither of those steps fit the liberal agenda.   Party chairmen often are little known outside Washington andpolitical circles. Brown will be out front as chairman. That'sobviously his preference, but the lower profile wouldn't be anoption even if he sought it. As the first black chairman he is sureto be a spokesman on issues and topics that go beyond the nuts andbolts business of political organization.   ``I've got to be one of several messengers,'' he said, aspokesman as well as a technician. Senate Majority Leader GeorgeMitchell and House Speaker Jim Wright are the ranking messengers.Brown said he already has discussed his role with them.   Now he has to sort it out with skeptics, with Democrats who seehim as the wrong representative to choose after a presidentialelection in which the L word _ liberal _ was used by Republicans asa political curse. To that end, even before the committee election,Brown plans a swing across the South, ``to reach out ... raise thecomfort level.''   He knows the Democrats have problems on issues like nationaldefense, law and order, federal spending. But he says copyingRepublicans is no answer. ``The last thing this country needs is twoRepublican parties,'' Brown said. ``One is quite enough.''   That has a familiar ring. As newly-elected chairman in 1985, Kirksaid much the same thing, and immediately went South, saying hedidn't need to wait for an invitation to go fence-mending.   ``Today marks the end of the soul-searching, the end of theidentity crisis of the Democratic Party,'' Kirk said four years agowhen he became chairman.   Not quite.</TEXT><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Walter R. Mears, vice president and columnist forThe Associated Press, has reported on Washington and nationalpolitics for more than 25 years.</TEXT></DOC>
