Gholamreza Aqazadeh singled out Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and theUnited Arab Emirates in chastising members of the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries for ignoring an agreement onproduction restraints.   ``Oil producing countries, whether members of OPEC or not, haveto arrive at an understanding among themselves,'' Aqazadeh said inan interview carried by the Islamic Republic News Agency.   ``Countries which place obstacles in the way of this objectivewould be responsible for the deteriorating situation on the oilmarket,'' he said in the interview, monitored in Nicosia.   Oil prices dropped in recent weeks to their lowest levels since1986, when they fell to about $8 per barrel. Crude oil from thegulf state of Dubai was selling for $12.40 a barrel Thursday, downfrom $12.50 the day before.   In two meetings this year, the 13 OPEC members failed to reach aconsensus on new production quotas to stop prices from falling.They agreed last month in Vienna to extend current quotas until theend of 1988.   Iran depends heavily on its oil production to finance its nearly8-year-old war with Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
