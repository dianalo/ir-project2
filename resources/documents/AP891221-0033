Family Court Judge Stephen Levin spent nearly $7,000 in courtfunds for a full-page ad last week in the Philadelphia Daily News,listing 136 fathers and six mothers accused of ignoring benchwarrants for more than a year, mostly for failing to pay childsupport. He warned they would go to jail if they did not respondimmediately.   Sixty delinquent fathers and two mothers did, although they wereangry about the unexpected and unwanted publicity.   ``They said they were petrified, angry, humiliated, and severaltold me they were even afraid to show their face on the street,''Levin said.   While mothers congratulated the judge for his innovativeapproach, it irritated a group called Fathers and ChildrenEquality, which claims Family Court caters far too much to mothersand takes too long to handle child visitation violations.   ``Why doesn't he do it to the women who are purposely keepingtheir children from their fathers?'' asked Benjamin Manis, who hasexperienced problems with his former wife over their 4-year-old.``We don't get equal rights in Family Court.''   The judge said he recognized the validity of complaints overvisitation rights, but said he was elated at the results of the ad.   ``We got an immediate response, and we sent a strong message toothers delinquent in child support that if you don't want your namein the paper, you better pay up,'' he said.   Levin said he would also try to address the visitation problem.   ``Custody is difficult to deal with and, sometimes, fatherswon't pay support because the mothers won't let them see thechildren,'' the judge said.   ``And fathers are resentful because courts don't move as swiftlyto help them as they do for mothers seeking support. In the middle,unfortunately, are the kids, and we are there to make sure they aretaken care of.''   What about those 76 fathers and four mothers who have ignoredthe ad?   ``I am going to get sheriff's deputies to arrest them, and I amgoing to put them in prison,'' Levin said. ``I am not bluffing.''</TEXT></DOC>
