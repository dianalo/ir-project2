the new one involvesthe development of performance prediction tools and methodologies foranalysing network information systems to help NCR market its local areanetworking systems and integrate its products into complete networkingsolutions.andM;- o -andM;In a move intended to demonstrate what a good corporate citizen it is,Fujitsu America Inc has been doing its sums and reckons that exports of itsUS-made computer and telecommunications products for 1989 exceeded $24m:exports included disk and cartridge tape storage devices, cellular car phonesand modems, all manufactured, designed and engineered in the US at thecompany's manufacturing facilities in Palm Bay, Florida; Anaheim, California;Richardson, Texas; and Hillsboro, Oregon; exports went to Japan, Canada,South America, the UK, New Zealand, Australia, Mexico, Belgium and Taiwan; in1989, the company broke ground on its $80m North American TelecommunicationsCentre, set for completion in 1992.andM;- o -andM;Northern Telecom Ltd has added Integrated Services Digital Network PrimaryRate Access capabilities to its DMS-250 and DMS-250 SuperNode digital tandemswitching systems: new DMS-250/SuperNode components required to add ISDNPrimary Rate capabilities include a Network Termination and a digital trunkcontroller for ISDN equipped with a D channel controller card, which providesfrom one to 32 D channels for every 480 trunks; updated software used tocontrol the DMS-250 is also necessary; it's available next month at a typical$286,000.andM;- o -andM;Newcomer UltraStor Corp, Irvine, California has launched as its first productthe Ultra 12F AT-compatible ESDI - enhanced small device interface - diskcontroller, with 10MHz, 15MHz and 20MHz ESDI drive support at 1:1 Interleave,the ability to co-reside with another hard drive or floppy drive controller,support for three floppy drives, support for drives over 528Mb without thirdparty software, 8Kb or optional 32Kb look-ahead buffer, and on-board NovellInc low level format and scan drive preparation; no prices; UltraStor's aimis to provide controllers for micros that rival those on mainframes.andM;- o -andM;Telesoft Inc, San Diego says its second-generation TeleGen2 Ada developmentsystem has been implemented for IBM's new RISC System/6000 workstation andservers series: IBM has licensed TeleGen2 Ada development tools, includingcomponents of the compiler, a Source Level Debugger, Global Optimiser andLanguage Tools from TeleSoft to make the system the foundation for theworkstation's IBM AIX Ada/6000, which will be sold and supported by IBM; itis fully compatible with the Ada Development System for IBM's 370s.andM;- o -andM;Barrister Information Systems Corp, Buffalo, New York has converted andinstalled its Barrister/Eagle Time andamp; Billing software on an IBM AS/400,running in native mode, and reckons it is the only active IBM BusinessPartner in the US to offer a legal accounting software package running in theAS/400 Native Mode.andM;- o -andM;Alliance Semiconductor Inc has been ordered out of its plant in Kansas City,Missouri by its landlord, ATandamp;T Co after failing to pay its rent: MissouriGovernor John Ashcroft hailed the start-up of the plant a year ago, sayingAlliance's plan to produce dynamic RAMs chips would bring 1,200 jobs to thestate and make the US more competitive in the battle with Japan (CI No 1,128)but Alliance never employed more than 100, and its expansion plan stalledwith the down-turn that hit the semiconductor industry in 1989.andM;- o -andM;Only three weeks after returning to Kaypro Corp, David Kay is stepping backagain: he has handed his duties as president over to Roy Salisbury, managingdirector of the FCSGroup: Kay says he has spent the past three weeksanalysing Kaypro's current financial and industry position and isrecommending that the company assemble a new management team with a proventrack record in financial and administrative restructuring; Kay will returnto his career as an independent marketing consultant to the computerindustry; Andrew Kay, former president and chief executive will continue asKaypro's chairman of the board.andM;- o -andM;ATandamp;T Microelectronics, Berkeley Heights, New Jersey reckons that it is one ofthe first semiconductor companies to achieve full-production manufacture ofsub-micron, semi-custom integrated circuits for telecommunications equipment,disk drives, personal computers and high performance engineeringworkstations; ATandamp;T's 0.9 micron CMOS standard cell family is now inproduction and achieving greater than 150MHz clock speeds, ATandamp;T claims.andM;- o -andM;Aware of the &quot;cowboy&quot; image associated with the cellular phone market,Millicom Cellular (UK) Ltd has announced a new commission structure for itsdealers that is intended to shift the emphasis away from the hard sell tobetter support and &quot;professional conduct&quot;: well-behaved dealers will beawarded certificates that in time will translate into a more financiallybeneficial relationship with Millicom, which is hoping to gain the BritishStandard 5750 part 2 accreditation for service and quality assurance in Aprilof this year.andM;- o -andM;Elaborating on its determination to remain in the computer business (CI No1,376), Philips NV says that it is interested in finding a computer partner,although it intends to retain control, and says that an announcement islikely soon; if it has found a partner, all the signs seem to point to Ivrea:Ing C Olivetti andamp; Co SpA both use the Arix Corp Edgecore super-68020 emulatorprocessors at the top of their Unix lines, and the lower end 68000 familyUnix machines are also similar; both are substantial players in bankingterminals and could achieve economies of scale in development and inmanufacturing of some of the essential banking peripherals such as journalprinters and card readers; in the present climate in Europe, such a moveseems the most likely, but if Philips is ready to buck the trend, it haslong-standing ties with Motorola Inc's computer business, so a merger of itscomputer business with Motorola's European computer operations - with Philipsretaining at least 51%, is not inconceivable.andM;- o -andM;IBM &quot;will announce Summit in June 1990 with deliveries in the fourthquarter&quot;, believes Atlantic Computers Plc, which reckons the new machineswill use the same technology as S and J 3090s, initially with &quot;300&quot; and &quot;600&quot;models and that it will be possible to upgrade 3090s to Summit; later in thelife cycle, IBM will announce smaller and larger models, and there will beupgrades to replace the first generation Summit and to obsolete S and Jtechnology; if Atlantic's scenario is accurate, then there is a good case forcontinued investment in S and J models, and the company's significantcommittment to 3090 CPUs would be vindicated.andM;- o -andM;Telematics International Inc warns that it might have $2m in undisclosedliabilities, resulting from a transaction involving a financial officer nowon leave of absence.andM;- o -andM;Japan has agreed to scrap the 1987 supercomputer pact with the US andnegotiate a new one on public sector purchase of Cray Research boxes.andM;- o -andM;Expanding on its uninspired 1989 figures (p5), Nokia Oy says that sales atits Nokia Data Systems unit rose 4.5% at $1,291m with operating profit flatand unsatisfactory; overall, the electronics division saw sales up 8.1% at$3,604m, 62% of the total of the company that was formerly dominated bytimber and paper, and up from 47% in 1987; star performer in the electronicsdivision was the Mobira cellular telephone arm, which saw sales soar 54.8% at$443m - but even that made an operating loss because of losses at the CuePaging Corp business in the US - that unit is to be divested with dispatch.andM;- o -andM;They do these things rather differently in West Germany, and where it isalmost inconceivable that a business with 1,000 employees and estimatedannual sales of $150m could go to just two individuals in a buy-out, that iswhat has happened to Philips NV's Systeme andamp; Sondertechnik defence subsidiary:it is being acquired by DST Deutsche SystemTechnik GmbH, a company formed forthe purpose and equally owned by Bruno Jacobi, managing director of the unit,and Hans-Jrg Zobel, who had been marketing director of the business untillast March, when he quit to become European sales director for ConcurrentComputer Corp; terms of the buy-out - and where the cash for it is comingfrom, have not been disclosed.andM;- o -andM;The Department of Trade andamp; Industry and the National Computing Centre havelaunched a Computer Security Awareness programme for small and medium sizedfirms: the three-year programme aims to help companies protect the storage,transmission, and display of information; subjects covered are to includecontingency planning, personal computer security, computer viruses, accesscontrol and fire protection, back up procedures, risk analysis, networksecurity, insurance, and legal requirements; fact sheets and an informationpack are available from the National Computing Centre.andM;- o -andM;Integrated Information Technology Inc, one of the companies offering mathsco-processors compatible with but faster than Intel Corp's 80X87 series, isnow offering a lower price as well as a faster speed than Intel: the San Josecompany says that the cuts are made possible by the impact of broad marketacceptance of the products leading to cost efficiencies and lowermanufacturing costs: the IIT-2C87 and IIT-3C87 are direct replacements forIntel's 80287, 80C287A and 80387 products respectively but the IIT-2C87 isnow 9% cheaper than the Intel part with a 20MHz version at $500, the 3C87 is23% cheaper with the 33MHz part costing $780.andM;- o -andM;Racal-Redac Ltd is looking to buy again - this time the target is said to beSilc Technologies Inc.andM;- o -andM;Daisy Systems Corp says that the version of its computer-aided engineeringsuite of applications is available for Sun Microsystems Inc's Sun-4 Sparcline this month.andM;- o -andM;Watch out, there's a virus about: Purdue University professor Eugene Spaffordreckons that while there were 10 viruses unleashed last year that affectedMS-DOS micros, up from six over the previous two years, six new ones havesurfaced in just the first two months of 1990 - and &quot;the newest are moremalicious and harder to detect&quot;.andM;- o -andM;It's kinda tough running a business school these days - no sooner had thedevisers of Masters of Business Administration Course taken on boardHewlett-Packard Co's brilliant new management concept developed in the 1980scalled MBWA it came up with a completely new one - the Board of Directors -no not that kind of board of directors, this one is made up of the key peopleinvolved on every aspect of a product development from design throughmanufacturing to documentation, sales and marketing, with key changes in theproduct specification resulting from input from people that would nevernormally be asked: it's so successful that according to the Wall StreetJournal one manager commented that &quot;most of us get our work done in theevenings and on weekends - our time at the plant is mostly 'people time'&quot;;and what does old hat MBWA stand for?
