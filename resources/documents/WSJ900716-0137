Or will it be bad after all?   The two defense contractors disclosed last month that theywould probably face write-offs because of delays indeveloping the A-12 attack plane for the Navy. Now, though, aconsensus seems to be emerging on Wall Street that thecompanies -- especially McDonnell Douglas -- may be inclinedto hold off recording any such adjustments. Instead, theywould signal that they underestimated their costs on theprogram by a certain amount, but are contesting who will payfor the overrun -- the companies or the government.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;All you need to do is say a claim is being filed, ratherthan declare the loss up front,&quot; Paul Nisbet ofPrudential-Bache Securities Inc. says. &quot;And then you waituntil the matter is adjudicated.&quot;   But he adds that there seems to be some &quot;disagreementbetween General Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas over how theyshould handle the situation.&quot; Industry observers indicatethat General Dynamics may, on its own, register a charge toearnings, given that it was booking a profit on the A-12program for some time. McDonnell Douglas, by contrast, neverdid this. And given that the company's loan agreements withits bankers are tied to its net worth, or assets minusliabilities, McDonnell Douglas has a special incentive toavoid write-downs whenever it can.   The companies, both of which are based in St. Louis,decline to comment on the A12. So do two Defense Departmentspokesmen.   Were the companies forced to take a second-quarter hit onthe A-12, it could be substantial. Several securitiesanalysts, including Peter Aseritis of First Boston Corp. andJerry Cantwell of Wertheim Schroder andamp; Co., estimate that eachcompany could be in trouble to the tune of $300 millionbefore taxes.   Admittedly, though, the analysts arrive at this figure ina roundabout way: The companies are said to have underbidGrumman Corp. on the A-12 contract by $1 billion. Figuringthat perhaps $400 million of that sum was legitimate, becauseGeneral Dynamics and McDonnell Douglas have significantlymore experience with stealth aircraft technology, that leaves$600 million to account for, and this amount is then splitbetween the two.   Besides the A-12, there could be a few other surprises.   Howard Rubel of Cyrus J. Lawrence Inc. is wary thatGeneral Dynamics may soon have to take a charge on thesingle-channel ground and airborne radio system, or Sincgars,project for the Army. Moreover, market watchers warn thatLockheed Corp. might report some sort of write-off as aresult of its decision in May to pull its aircraft operationsout of Burbank, Calif.   And McDonnell Douglas recently suggested that it may have&quot;serious cost problems&quot; on several other fixed-pricedevelopment pacts with the Pentagon.   But what many believe is McDonnell Douglas's biggestthorn, the C-17 cargo plane, shouldn't draw blood insecond-quarter results.   During a tour earlier this month at the sprawling C-17factory in Long Beach, Calif., company officials emphasizedthat no write-offs on the program were in sight. &quot;We're rightup on the bulkhead&quot; of the contract's cost ceiling, but&quot;we're going to make it,&quot; asserts John Capellupo, deputypresident of McDonnell Douglas's transport aircraft unit.   He adds that the company's MD-80 commercial jet lineturned around during the second period. &quot;We promised 34, andwe did 34,&quot; Mr. Capellupo says. This success should helpoffset continuing high development expenditures on the MD-11three-engine jet.   Such success also would help damp rumors that McDonnellDouglas is headed for a bankruptcy-law filing or that thecompany's Long Beach facilities will be sold. Speculation tothat effect has been circulating through the financialmarkets for the past few days, as has talk that Chairman JohnMcDonnell is going to resign. The company says all of this is&quot;absolutely false.&quot; But people at the company say that duringthe next couple of days, Mr. McDonnell will hold a newsconference and meetings with employees, where he will explainhow he expects to cut $700 million a year in operating costs;thousands of layoffs are likely to be announced, and the workforce is jittery.   Meanwhile, Martin Marietta Corp., Northrop Corp. and theparts supplier Rohr Industries Inc. all look poised to turnin solid, if unspectacular, results for the quarter.Companies more oriented toward defense electronics, includingE-Systems Inc. and Loral Corp., are expected to showyear-to-year gains. Raytheon Co. already has logged an 8%increase in profit for its latest three months.   But the clearest winner, as usual, will be Boeing Co. TheSeattle-based company delivered 100 commercial aircraftduring the second period, up from 81 a year earlier. Thelatest number includes 15 747400s, Boeing's most profitableproduct.   &quot;The theme for the quarter,&quot; Mr. Rubel of Cyrus J.Lawrence says, &quot;is that you've got to own Boeing&quot; stock.</TEXT></DOC>
