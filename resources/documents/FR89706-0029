The existing regulations provide,in part, that the appellant and/or representative may submit additionalpertinent evidence following certification and transfer of the appeal tothe Board. However, they do not provide a time period during which anyadditional pertinent evidence, or request for personal hearing or changeof representation, should be submitted.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received by August 7, 1989. Comments willbe available for public inspection until August 15, 1989. It is proposedto make these regulations effective 30 days after final publication inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4>.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Interested persons are invited to submit written comments,suggestions, or objections regarding the proposal to the Secretary of VeteransAffairs (271A), Department of Veterans Affairs, 810 Vermont Avenue, NW.,Washington, DC 20420. All written comments received will be available forinspection only in the Veterans Service Unit, room 132, at the above addressonly between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. Monday through Friday(except holidays) until August 15, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Mr. Jan Donsbach, Special LegalAssistant to the Chairman, Board of Veterans Appeals, (202) 233-2978.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Proposed amendments to 38 CFR 19.174would add a cutoff date after an appeal is transferred to the Board ofVeterans Appeals following which an appellant and/or representative maynot submit additional evidence, a request for a change in representativeor a request for a personal hearing. Under the revised procedures, theappellant and/or representative would have 60 days from the date of noticethat the appeal has been transferred to the BVA in which to act. Provisionwould be made for accepting evidence and requests at a later date whengood cause is shown. Related revisions would be made to 38 CFR 3.103(c),3.156(a), and 3.160(e) to insure that effective dates for subsequent awards,if any, are preserved when evidence is submitted too late for the Boardto consider in an appeal.Under existing procedures, an appellant may continue to submit additionalevidence and may submit requests for a personal hearing or for a changein his or her representative throughout the appellate process. As a result,the appellate record can be in a constant state of change while Membersof the Board of Veterans Appeals are deliberating on the appeal. Confusioncan sometimes result as to the exact nature of the record reviewed by theBoard. Particularly with the advent of judicial review (see Pub. L. 100-687),it is essential that a point be reached at which the appellate record isfixed. In addition, considerable delay can result when it is necessaryto remove an appellate record from the hands of those who are engaged inan orderly appellate review in order to respond to various tardy requestsand submissions. The proposed changes would assist in orderly and promptappeal processing and would help to clarify the nature and extent of evidenceconsidered by the Board in reaching a decision in any given appeal.The Secretary hereby certifies that the proposed rule will not, if promulgated,have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entitiesas they are defined in the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA), 5 U.S.C. 601-612.Pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b), this rule is therefore exempt from the initialand final regulatory flexibility analyses requirements of sections 603and 604. It will have no significant direct impact on small entities (i.e.,small businesses, small private and nonprofit organizations, and smallgovernmental jurisdictions) inasmuch as it concerns the Rules of Practicegoverning the appeals of individual claimants before the Board.VA has also determined that this rule is nonmajor in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12291. It will not have an adverse economic impact on or increasecosts to consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, and local governmentagencies, or geographic regions.There is no Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>38 CFR Part 3Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Disability benefits, Healthcare, Pensions, Veterans.38 CFR Part 19Administrative practice and procedure, Claims, Veterans.<ITAG tagnum="21">Approved: June 12, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward J.

If the Board denied a benefit soughtin the pending appeal and any evidence so referred which was received priorto the date of the Board's decision, or testimony presented at a hearingresulting from a request for a hearing so referred, together with the evidencealready of record, is subsequently found to be the basis of an allowanceof that benefit, the effective date of the award will be the same as ifthe benefit had been granted by the Board as a result of the appeal whichwas pending at the time that the hearing request or additional evidencewas received.(2) <T3>Good cause shown. </T3>If good cause is shown, the request for a changein representation or for a personal hearing will be honored.
