 The bulk of those machines usedot-generation technology based on patents owned by Hell.andP;  Now a new U.S.andO;company, Delta Scan, has developed a color scanner and dot-generatingrecorder based on alternative technology, to which it owns the patents-amatrix of light-emitting diodes, or LEDs.andM;History.andP;  Delta Scan was founded in 1977 by Richard Berman, a mechanicalengineer who developed the world's first commercial exercise cardiogram inthe 1960s and went on to develop a device for reading clotting blood levelsin hospitals.andP;  That device achieved worldwide success, and the company waseventually acquired by Warner-Lambert in 1976 enabling Berman to retire.andM;Retirement didn't last long.andP;  A friend at Harrison Printing, aPhiladelphia-area printer that wanted to enter the prepress business, toldBerman about the difficulties of producing electronic color separations.andO;Intrigued, Berman investigated the Hell and Crosfield units available at thetime and decided he could build a better, flat-bed, all-digital device.andP;  Withfunding from several investors, Berman founded Delta Scan for the purpose ofdeveloping a graphic arts digital scanner/recorder.andM;In the mid-1980s, Delta Scan patented the method and apparatus of imagingphoto-sensitive material with a two-dimensional matrix of LEDs.andP;  Berman choseLED technology for two main reasons.andM;First, LEDs are very stable, long-lasting devices that need virtually nomaintenance.andP;  Second, because they expose the material in a single instant,they are completely digital: there is no analog process of varying the spotby time, as with laser-based devices.andM;The use of a two-dimensional LED matrix, as opposed to a single raster fine,makes it possible to construct dots of varying sizes and shapes in a singleexposure.andP;  It also is faster than writing an image in raster lines.andM;It's taken 12 years, but Delta Scan is now about ready to market a completecolor scanner/recorder for the graphic arts market.andM;Scanner.andP;  The Delta Scan machine has separate scanner and recorder units.andP;  Inthe scanner, a xenon fight source illuminates the flat surface; light isdetected by three solid-state sensors, one for each color, which move throughthe original in a serpentine motion.andP;  With different lenses, the resolutionof the scan may be as high as 6,000 dpi.andM;Delta Scan was unwilling to reveal the exact nature of its sensor technology,which it claims is unique but is not patented.andP;  The unit has a dynamic rangeexceeding three decades, and Delta Scan says it is more reliable andcomparable in quality to conventional photo-multipliers used in most of theprepress scanners.andM;Images may be transparent or reflective, up to 20&quot; by 24&quot; in size.andM;The interface.andP;  One of the key aspects of the Delta Scan scanner is that itsuser interface is considerably simpler than that of conventional drumscanners.andP;  It does not require an operator with years of experience.andO;Although knowledge of scanning would certainly help when making colorcorrections, the goal of Delta Scan is to achieve predictable results atdefault settings.andP;  The samples we've seen produced from default settings bearthis out-the quality of the unit appears to be suitable for commercialprinters.andM;The interface of the unit is a specially built touch-screen, driven by anAT-class PC, with simple menus for entering information about the scan andmaking adjustments.andP;  The menus are, for the most part, self-explanatory andfar simpler than the interfaces of most drum scanners.andM;One addition that would be useful, though, is a preview monitor.andP;  Like mostprepress scanners, the Delta Scan unit provides no visual feedback except byexposing the image to film.andP;  A preview monitor, such as those typically usedby desktop scanners, would make it possible to crop and size the imagevisually, rather than by number.andP;  It could also be used to gauge the effectsof color corrections.andM;For those who want to make color corrections, the Delta Scan scanner has abuilt-in densitometer for taking readings of the image.andP;  Presently, thereadings are done by moving the scan head around the image, but because youcan't see all of the image, it is difficult to tell exactly where the shadowand highlight areas are.andP;  Again, a preview screen for picking the lightestand darkest points would be helpful, particularly for inexperiencedoperators.andM;The scanner enables making graduation adjustments at five points along theshadow-highlight scale.andP;  Changes to selective colors may also be made.andM;The color computer.andP;  Like other prepress scanners, the Delta Scan unit hasits own color computer, which is a proprietary device built specifically forimage processing.andP;  The scanner records 36 bits of color data per pixel,interpolated down to 24 bits for processing.andM;The data is fed into a buffer and then transferred to the computer, whichapplies the UCR and GCR techniques to generate a black channel.andP;  Colorcorrections are then applied to the image using high-speed digital signalprocessing chips.andP;  If the scanned image is to be halftoned right away, datais fed to the recorder as each image line is processed.andM;The recorder.andP;  The recorder uses four identical flatbed imaging units,mounted one on top of the other in a stack.andP;  Each is tied to a series ofboards that do the halftoning on the fly as the data comes in and is fed tothe recorder.andP;  Each imaging unit has a matrix of LEDs that expose an entireline as the head moves across the film surface.andM;The unit writes in both directions: as one fine is completed, sweeping fromleft to right, the unit moves back a notch and writes the next line in theopposite direction, in a serpentine pattern identical to the scanner.andP;  Theidea is to set up a one-to-one correspondence between scanner and recorder,so that the data sent to the buffer from the scanner is the data fed to therecorder.andM;Standard halftone dot shapes offered are circular, elliptical, square andtriangular, but customized shapes may be specified as well.andP;  Through the useof built-in lenses, the resolution may be varied to produce screens up to 200lpi.andM;The unit is fast: a complete set of four 8 x 10 films at 150-line screen canbe made in 15 minutes, including scanning and recording.andM;Targeting those new to color.andP;  As we mentioned at the outset, there are veryfew companies that have succeeded in building prepress-quality colorscanner/recorders.andP;  Not only is color halftoning difficult, but themechanical precision required of color recorders is such that they areinvariably expensive devices that appeal to a very small market.andM;Although the Delta Scan machine has yet to be proven, the technology builtinto its prototype shows promise.andP;  What remains to be seen is whether thecompany, now that it has finished the initial phase of its development, cansucceed in marketing a product.andM;Delta Scan views the quick-printer market as a prime candidate for itsdevice.andP;  Quick-printers are beginning to buy a new generation of inexpensivetwo- and four-color presses to expand their business into color services.andO;The drawback to getting into color, for many quick-printers, is the overheadof training and paying experienced color scanner operators.andP;  Manyquick-printers send out their separation work to avoid the hassles of doingit themselves.andM;Delta Scan believes that these printers would prefer to do their ownseparations-if they had a device that was easily learned, maintained andoperated and delivered quality suitable for their work.andM;Although Delta Scan is targeting those new to color, its first machine isdesigned for those who want high-quality separations.andP;  It has yet to announcepricing, but it expects the complete unit to sell for about $150,000.andM;Delta Scan is still in the process of formulating its marketing strategy.andP;  Itis willing to discuss OEM and VAR relationships, but it is also pursuingdirect sales.andP;  As Berman puts it, &quot;I took one company from scratch toworldwide sales and distribution; now I'm ready to do it again.&quot;andM;Delta Scan Inc., 2300 Computer Ave., Willow Grove, PA 19090-1712;
