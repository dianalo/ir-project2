The refinery's capacity will rise to 300,000 barrels a day, morethan twice the current production, the radio quoted Oil MinisterGholamreza Aqazadeh as saying.   The refinery, which was repeatedly bombed by Iraqi planes in the1980-88 gulf war, started partial operation in April 1989.   An army of engineers and technicians have been working on thecomplex around the clock since the August 1988 cease-fire.   Oil exports account for more than 90 percent of Iran's hardcurrency earnings.   The broadcast, monitored in Nicosia, quoted Aqazadeh as sayingthere were plans to link the refinery to a pipeline, and transportits products nationwide.   Iran, the third-largest oil exporter within the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, has benefitted from high oil pricesbrought on by the Persian Gulf crisis, which was triggered byIraq's Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait.   The halt in Kuwaiti production, and a United Nations-imposedembargo on Iraqi oil, cut 4 million barrels a day frominternational markets, boosting prices to a record $41 a barrel.</TEXT></DOC>
