CAMPBELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A government proposal for a voluntary testingprogram for Salmonella enteritidis _ a bacteria responsible for atleast 11 deaths from Grade A table eggs since January 1985 _ isdrawing fire from the poultry and egg industries.   ``I'm an egg farmer. I like my job and I don't want to makeanybody sick,'' Richard McGrath, president of the U.S. EggMarketers association, told a panel hearing comments on the programdesigned to wipe out the national increase in salmonellaenteritidis.   Ken Looper of the United Egg Producers said voluntary programsdon't work because, ``One state might implement the program and theneighboring state would not. This creates marketing problems.''   Another problem, he said, was, ``One-half of the hens in a statemight be tested and these birds could then be reinfected byuntested birds.''   The federal Centers for Disease Control recently reported asixfold increase in the cases of salmonella enteritidis infectionsin humans from 1977 to 1986, said Dr. Robert V. Tauxe of theAtlanta-based CDC. He noted that between January 1985 and May 1987,more than 2,000 cases, including 11 deaths, were reported.   Outbreaks this year in the Northeast prompted health officialsto halt sales of eggs from at least one supplier and the formationof a joint task force of the Food and Drug Administration andDepartment of Agriculture which issued a four-point voluntaryprogram to reduce contamination, FDA Commissioner Dr. Frank E.Young said.   Young and Dr. Kenneth A. Gilles, assistant secretary ofagriculture for marketing and inspection services, conductedThursday's hearing on the program.   Gilles said that while the regulatory program was distributed``in a voluntary form, federal agencies are prepared to adopt amandatory alternative if the voluntary approach provesunsuccessful.''   McGrath and Looper were among several industry representativeswho pushed the government to make mandatory the testing andmonitoring of egg farms, slaughtering of infected laying flocks anddiverting of any healthy eggs from such flocks to breaking plantsfor pasteurization as dry eggs.   The industry representatives also urged implementation of acompliance mechanism, research and public education.   Looper noted the unprofitability of selling eggs forpasteurization, and said the USDA should use its statutory powersto enforce the regulations by seizing and eliminating the infectedflocks. However, he said he was not advocating the clause in thelaw which gives the USDA the power to jail the non-complyingfarmers.   ``Shell egg consumption has decreased in the second quarter of1988 by 7 percent,'' Looper said.   ``Our concern for the public safety and the confidence we needfrom the consumer has prompted us to take extensive action withinour industry,'' he said, noting that one egg association invested$1 million into research.''   Egg industry representatives also expressed concern about thepossible effect of news media coverage of the problem.   Young replied: ``We`re not saying not to eat eggs at all, butthere is a problem at this time.''   ``The most susceptible are the very old, the very young, thoseladies who are pregnant and people whose immune systems arecompromised _ those people with AIDS and other acquired immunediseases,'' Young said.   The bulletins advise high-risk consumers to avoid eating raweggs, lightly cooked or runny eggs and food containing raw eggssuch as homemade Caesar salad dressing, Hollandaise sauce, icecream, eggnog and mayonnaise. Commercial forms of these productsare safe because they are made with pasteurized eggs.
