But some of his choices have recently been out of favor with some of the mutual fund's socially conscious investors.    The $5 million San Francisco-based fund looks for companies that treat their employees well and are sensitive to the communities where they operate, among other traits of what Mr. Dodson calls enlightened management.    Earlier this year, however, &quot;at least one investor&quot; withdrew from Parnassus because its portfolio includes companies that do business in South Africa, Mr. Dodson says. The action by the investors, whose names he won't divulge, is evidence, he says, that &quot;different people have different interpretations of what is socially responsible investment.&quot;    Mr. Dodson says, &quot;We vote our proxies to leave South Africa.&quot; But even though he thinks all American companies should pull out, he doesn't believe in selling off the likes of Deere andamp; Co., a &quot;really good company that's in South Africa doing positive things.&quot;    So-called socially sensitive mutual funds have grown hot. Investment in the stock and money-market funds, which often screen out companies engaged in such activities as the manufacture of weapons or nuclear power, or that cause environmental pollution, has grown exponentially in recent years to more than $6 billion.    But the public's growing acceptance of the funds isn't making it any easier for investors and portfolio managers to decide what is or isn't a socially responsible investment. &quot;If you look deep enough you'll find some problem with any company,&quot; says Howard Shapiro, a Portland, Ore., investor who says his purchases are guided by social considerations.    Fund managers have the same problem picking stocks. &quot;You come upon the limitation of your ideals,&quot; says Grace Parker Sannino, a founder of the Calvert Group's Social Investment Fund, a $198 million fund. Sometimes, she says, &quot;you have to get companies out of your portfolio in ways that don't hurt the portfolio. Those tradeoffs do exist.&quot;    Furthermore, activities that one fund finds socially responsible might strike another as repellant. Calvert, for instance, won't invest in companies that make weapons systems, but it will invest in big companies that provide fuel to the military. Pax World Fund avoids the top 100 defense contractors but accepts companies that do business in South Africa. Dreyfus Corp.'s Third Century Fund frowns on companies with South African operations but not on major defense companies.    Third Century Fund's broad guidelines on defense-industry investments have elicited criticism within the corporate-responsibility movement. Dreyfus's social screen &quot;is big enough to drive a nuclear weapon through,&quot; says Timothy Smith, executive director of Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility, which represents 250 Protestant denominations and Catholic dioceses and manages their $15 billion combined stock portfolio.    Jeffrey Friedman, president of Third Century, says the $173 million fund focuses on companies' equal employment, environmental and occupational and product safety records. &quot;We're not making any claims that we're not fulfilling,&quot; he says of the criticism.    Portfolio managers agree that investment decisions tax their consciences more than they expected. &quot;This area is fraught with dilemmas in choosing stocks,&quot; says David Schoenwald, portfolio manager of $3 million New Alternatives Fund, based in Great Neck, N.Y., which concentrates on solar and alternative energy investments. &quot;When we started selecting companies five years ago, we thought we wouldn't have many conflicts,&quot; he says. &quot;But some things aren't so pure -- so black and white.&quot;    An example is New Alternatives' investment in Idaho Power Co. New Alternatives holds the utility because it is one of the few that generates power hydroelectrically and doesn't use nuclear fuel, says Mr. Schoenwald. But Idaho Power also opposes certain efforts to advance the commercialization of solar power. On balance, says Mr. Schoenwald, &quot;I feel that it's a good company worth holding.&quot;    The difficulty of drawing a line can be seen in other funds. For example Calvert, based in Washington, D.C., says its Social Investment Fund avoids South Africa-related companies and companies that make weapons or weapon systems, while investing in companies that promote the delivery of safe products and services, provide equal employment opportunity and conduct fair labor negotiations.    The Calvert fund, whose portfolio decisions are made by five professionals at Boston-based U.S. Trust Co., has been debating whether to sell its 7,500 shares of Angelica Corp., a St. Louis-based hospital-supply company. Last year Angelica ran afoul of the National Labor Relations Board, and last month a federal appeals court upheld an NLRB ruling that Angelica had wrongly refused to bargain with a union.    Calvert's trustees have delayed a decision on whether to dump the stock pending the outcome of labor talks that Angelica began last week under court order. &quot;The company had a history of reasonably good labor relationships, so we've been giving them the benefit of the doubt,&quot; says Lawrence Litvak, a U.S. Trust portfolio manager. Angelica says it is &quot;hopeful&quot; it can reach a &quot;satisfactory agreement&quot; with its union.    But non-social considerations will also influence the decision to sell or keep the stock. Mr. Litvak says the union problem partly reflects Angelica's response to increased competition in the hospital-supply business. The competitive squeeze on profit margins also gives Mr. Litvak concern about the value of Angelica's stock, he says. </TEXT></DOC>
