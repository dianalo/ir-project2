<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-17-1033 </DOCNO><TEXT>We observe the emission of slow positive muons ({mu}{sup +}) from solidneon, argon, krypton, and xenon moderators exposed to a 4.2-MeV incident{mu}{sup +} beam. The time-of-flight spectra for all of the targets studiedexhibit a narrow distribution with no delayed component. Energy spectraobtained from the time-of-flight data indicate a maximum below {similar_to}10eV with a tail extending to higher energies. The data suggest a slowlythermalizing muon emission mechanism, implying a long diffusion lengthfor low-energy {mu}{sup +} in these solids. Of the targets measured,argon was observed to produce the highest yield ({similar_to}10/sup -5/slow {mu}{sup +} per incident {mu}{sup +}), providing a useful flux forfurther experimentation.</TEXT></DOC>
