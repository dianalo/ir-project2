The only way being left open is the immediate taking upof arms,'' said rebel commander Eduardo Sancho on rebel RadioVenceremos.   The Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front said Thursday ithad ``suspended our participation'' in peace talks. Rebel andgovernment representatives were to meet Nov. 20 in Caracas,Venezuela, in a third round of talks that began in Mexico inSeptember.   The talks had produced virtually no progress toward ending a10-year-old civil war that has killed an estimated 70,000 people.Each side accused the other of bad faith.   The government had no comment early today on the suspension ofthe talks.   Sancho said Tuesday's bombing of the National Federation ofSalvadoran Workers was ``the principal reason'' for suspension ofthe talks. He said the bombing ``marks a new line, a new politicalmoment'' similar to the early 1980s, when rampant politicalviolence was claiming up to 800 lives a month.   On Thursday, thousands of unionists buried their slain comradesand vowed revenge.   ``Because the color of blood is never forgotten, our slaincompanions will be avenged!'' the unionists shouted as they marchedthrough downtown.   Many carried wreaths and banners denouncing President AlfredoCristiani's rightist government.   The rebels said they had evidence the bombing was the decisionof military chief of staff Col. Rene Ponce, was authorized byChristiani and executed by Col. Elena Fuentes, commander of the SanSalvador-based 1st Army Brigade.   The rebels did not describe the nature of their evidence.   El Salvador observed the Day of the Dead holiday Thursday, andno government spokesman was available to respond to the accusation.The two-day holiday honors the deceased.   Cristiani, in an address Tuesday night, condemned the bombing asterrorism and pledged an investigation.   ``Death to D'Aubuisson!'' chanted the marchers Thursday,referring to Roberto D'Aubuisson, founder and honorary president ofCristiani's Republican Nationalist Alliance, or Arena.   Human rights advocates consider D'Aubuisson the mastermind ofrightist death squads that killed thousands of suspected leftistsin the early 1980s.   The marchers, some of whom wore bandanas covering their facesand carried nail-studded wooden staves, plastered walls downtownwith red-bordered posters emblazoned with the initials of theguerrilla front.   ``For the future of our children, everyone against Arena!,''said the poster.   Soldiers and police generally stayed well away from the marchroute. The only incident occurred when a truckload of army troopsapproached the rear of the march.   Marchers taunted the troops with shouts, and a soldier tossed atear-gas grenade that left a few dozen demonstrators crying andcoughing.   Two rocket-equipped air force helicopters flew over the march inrapid succession as it approached the Bermeja Cemetery on thecity's southern edge. The marchers shook their fists and sticks atthe aircraft.   The victims were buried without incident. Guerrilla priestMiguel Ventura, who had come secretly from the rebel-controllednortheastern mountains, officiated at the burial.   President Bush on Thursday condemned recent violence ``fromextremists from both the left and the right'' but said Cristiani'sgovernment ``continues in the democratic path'' of formerSalvadoran president Jose Napoleon Duarte.   Bush spoke at a ceremony honoring Duarte at Walter Reed MedicalCenter in Washington, where the former Salvadoran leader ishospitalized with terminal cancer.   In March, voters elected Cristiani over the candidate of thethen-governing Christian Democratic Party. Cristiani replacedDuarte, who by law could not run for re-election.</TEXT></DOC>
