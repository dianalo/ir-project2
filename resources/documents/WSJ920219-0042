Another half million dollars will be supplied by thepharmaceutical company to build a pilot plant.</LP><TEXT>   Taxol, currently in short supply, now is extracted fromthe bark of the rare Pacific yew tree. However, thisproduction method requires killing the tree, and has fueledcontroversy over its depletion of old-growth forests that arehome to the Northern spotted owl.   University of Mississippi botanist Edward Croom and hisco-workers have been surveying many species of ornamental yewshrubs that now are cultivated in nurseries around thecountry. Needles trimmed from such shrubs would yield tons ofrenewable biomass that would spare the wild-tree bark.   The pilot program launched at the University ofMississippi will initially yield only a small fraction ofdrug needed to treat all the cancer patients who mightbenefit. But the company's agreement to furnish funding for apilot plant should enable scaled-up manufacturing capabilityfor the future, the university said.</TEXT></DOC>
