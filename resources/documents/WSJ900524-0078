Even as they debate the issue, however, an overwhelmingmajority of voters believe a tax increase is probably comingwhether they want it or not. As Bush administration andcongressional negotiators meet to try to arrive at a strategyfor addressing the federal budget deficit, the poll foundthat 89% of the 1,007 registered voters surveyed believe atax increase is either very or somewhat likely this year.</LP><TEXT>   Voters are evenly divided over whether President Bushshould keep his campaign promise not to raise taxes, with 48%saying he shouldn't raise taxes and 48% saying conditionshave changed enough to warrant abandoning the pledge. That isa shift from previous polls, in which clear majorities ofvoters said Mr. Bush shouldn't raise taxes. As recently aslast month, 57% said the president should stick to hisopposition to a tax increase.   One reason for the shift in sentiment may be that thebudget summit has focused more attention on the continuingdeficit problem. &quot;The deficit is in the news and on people'sminds,&quot; say pollsters Peter Hart, a Democrat, and RobertTeeter, a Republican, who conducted the survey for The WallStreet Journal and NBC News.   Another reflection of heightened voter concern is that Mr.Bush's job-approval rating for handling the nation's economyslipped to 51%, its lowest level in the Journal/NBC poll,from 59% in April. Those who disapprove of his handling ofthe economy increased to 40% from 30%.   Though the president hasn't said unequivocally that hewould accept a tax increase as part of a deficit accord,voters clearly believe he's headed in that direction.   Just more than half the voters -- 51% -- believe thatPresident Bush is already breaking his no-new-taxes vow. Atthe same time, however, the poll indicates that thepresident's substantial popularity may insulate him from muchblame if he does change course and accept an increase.   Sixty-nine percent of those surveyed said it would makelittle or no difference in their opinion of Mr. Bush if heaccepted a deficit-reduction proposal that included a taxboost; another 12% said they would actually think more of himfor doing so. Only 17% said their opinion of the presidentwould go down.   In fact, only 16% of the voters surveyed said Mr. Bush'sadministration would be mostly to blame if taxes are raised.Rather, 36% said they would assign the blame mostly to formerPresident Reagan's administration. And 30% would blame theDemocrats in Congress.   The answers broke along party lines, however, withDemocrats and independents more likely to blame eitherRepublican administration, and Republicans more likely toblame the Democrats in Congress.   While opposition to a tax increase is softening, there'scertainly no broad consensus that it's the way to go. Askedwhether it would be better to live with the current budgetdeficit or to raise taxes, a slim plurality -- 49% -- choseraising taxes over the 43% that preferred to live with thedeficit. Those figures were influenced in part by voters' owneconomic condition: A majority of upper-income andmiddle-income workers preferred to raise taxes, while amajority of lower-income workers preferred to live with thedeficit.   And a strong majority of voters -- 59% -- said they wouldoppose a comprehensive plan for reducing the deficit thatwould include defense cuts, a freeze on most governmentprograms -- including Social Security -- and higher taxes,even if President Bush and Congress both embraced theproposal.   But the weakening opposition to tax boosts in general wasalso reflected when voters were asked their feelings aboutspecific possible tax increases. For instance, opposition toincreasing the income-tax rates for individuals declined to70% from the 79% in a Journal/NBC poll conducted lastJanuary; opposition to a gasoline-tax increase dropped to 55%from 72%; opposition to a national sales tax, to 54% from65%.   Support for higher alcohol and tobacco taxes rose to 83%from 78%. And voters who in December opposed raising thecapital-gains-tax rate by 52% to 42% are now about evenlysplit, with 49% supporting raising the rate and 47% opposed.The Bush administration, of course, is continuing to push fora reduction in the rate.   If taxes do have to be raised, the Journal/NBC poll foundvoters evenly split over whether they would trust Mr. Bush orCongress more to make the right decisions. Although theadministration has made a top priority of defending theincome-tax rates from increase, the poll indicated that,given the choice, Americans would much rather see higherrates for upper-income taxpayers than increased taxes ongasoline: 68% would rather see the rates on wealthy peopleincreased, while only 28% would rather see the gasoline taxrise.   ---   &quot;One of President Bush's promises was that he would notraise taxes. Do you think he should keep that promise, or doyou think conditions have changed and there are some thingsfor which he should now support a tax increase?&quot;                                                                                                                            Should Raise Taxes                                                                                                             11/'89                              38%       4/'90                              39%       5/'90                              48%                                                                                                                          Should Not Raise Taxes                                                                                                             11/'89                              55%       4/'90                              57%       5/'90                              48%                                                                                                        The Wall Street Journal/NBC News Poll</TEXT></DOC>
