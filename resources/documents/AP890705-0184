First City and the FDIC are seeking to redeem the FDIC's interestor sell it to a third party.   The FDIC participated in the $1.6 billion reorganization of theold First City entity in April 1988 by providing $970 million. Agroup of investors led by Abboud then purchased First City and theFDIC bought about 2 million shares of the new company's preferredstock and a warrant to buy 1 million additional shares until 1993.   That situation has created confusion about the FDIC'srelationship with First City, Abboud said Tuesday.   ``The FDIC sought upside profit potential through directinvestment wholly apart from the assistance package,'' he said.   Abboud said the sale of the FDIC's investment in First City wouldgive the company greater expansion flexibility.   He said the FDIC would realize a return on its investment ofabout 50 percent if the sale were made now.   ``The sale of the FDIC's investment will eliminate all suchconfusion and misperceptions and serve the best interests of allconcerned _ First City, its shareholders, its customers and theFDIC.''   First City operates 20 banks in 62 Texas locations and severalothers out of state.</TEXT></DOC>
