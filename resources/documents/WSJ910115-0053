Late last week, the Baltimore-based bank holding companyused proceeds from the recent $369 million sale of itsconsumer finance unit to repay $375 million to a group ofnine banks led by J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., due yesterday, peoplefamiliar with the debt said.</LP><TEXT>   In order to repay $271 million of variable rate notes duetoday, the company has to come up with additional cash or abank credit agreement, people familiar with MNC said. If MNCdoesn't make the payment, holders of the notes could try toforce the company into reorganization proceedings. MNCdeclined to comment.   MNC is seeking regulatory approval for its banksubsidiaries to buy about $500 million in assets currentlyowned by non-bank units of the parent company, Wall Streetsources said. Proceeds from such a sale could allow theparent company to make its debt payments on time. MNC is theparent of Maryland National Bank and American Security Bankof Washington, D.C.   After Bank of New England Corp., which failed lastweekend, MNC is viewed as the most-troubled among thenation's 30 biggest bank holding companies. It had a $241.9million loss in the first nine months of 1990, and itsnonperforming assets ballooned to $1.15 billion at Sept. 30from only $289.3 million a year earlier.   The Morgan-led bank syndicate could renew MNC's creditline to allow it to make the debt payment, but not without anagreement that probably would hinge on the future sale ofMNC's credit-card unit, a person close to MNC said. MNC istrying to sell the unit, the fourth-largest credit-cardissuer in the country, for as much as $1.3 billion in eithera public offering or a negotiated sale to a single buyer.   Wall Street sources say that although a sale of the unitcould not be completed fast enough to generate the neededcash, the bank syndicate could make a loan to MNC using thecredit-card unit as collateral.   However, MNC is seeking assurances from federal bankregulators that it can sell the credit-card unit withoutworrying about future government claims against the unit ifMNC's bank subsidiaries become insolvent, sources close tothe company said. Federal law allows regulators to seizeassets within a bank holding company if any of the company'sbank units become insolvent. Without a guarantee that theregulators won't pursue potential claims against thecredit-card unit, the sale of the unit would be made moredifficult if not impossible, the sources said.   The FDIC declined to comment on MNC's request or thestatus of the credit-card unit sale.   MNC common shares fell 25 cents yesterday to close at$1.875 each in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.   Bank analysts have estimated that various non-banksubsidiaries of MNC could fetch $1.5 billion in salesproceeds, which is about 1.5 times the total amount of MNCdebt scheduled to mature this year.</TEXT></DOC>
