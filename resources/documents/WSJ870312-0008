The board met into the evening yesterday without voting on the issue. They are considering a petition signed by several hundred Merc members two weeks ago calling for a ban on such dual trading.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock-index futures trading pit at the exchange accounts for about 75% of all stock-index futures trading.    Allegedly abusive trading practices carried out by some brokers and wide price swings in the pit have drawn fire from securities industry customers and regulators, as well as many Merc members. The members fear that abusive trading by certain brokers gives them all a bad reputation and could lead to restrictions being placed on their activities.    Industry critics say that dual trading enables a broker to trade ahead of a customer's order and profit from the market impact of the order. Trading ahead of customers is against Merc rules, but often escapes detection, futures traders say. </TEXT></DOC>
