L. 99-80, 99Stat. 183, reauthorized and amended the Equal Access to Justice Act, 5U.S.C. 504 (EAJ Act), which had expired September 30, 1984. The EAJ Actprovides for the award of attorneys' fees and other expenses to certainparties who prevail against the federal government in court cases and adversaryadministrative proceedings. Specifically, as relevant here, the EAJ Actapplies to litigation conducted before the Commission under the FederalMine Safety and Health Act of 1977, 30 U.S.C. 801 <T3>et seq.</T3> (1982), in which an eligible party prevails over the Departmentof Labor's Mine Safety and Health Administration. 29 CFR 2704.100 and 2704.103.Prevailing parties may receive awards if they meet the EAJ Act's eligibilitystandards (which set ceilings on the net worth and number of employeesof parties) and if the government's position was not ``substantially justified.''Under the amendments to the EAJ Act, the net worth ceilings for eligibleparties have been raised to $2,000,000 for individuals and $7,000,000 forpartnerships, corporations, and other entities. 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B).Units of local government may also now be eligible for fee awards. 5 U.S.C.504(b)(1)(B). Moreover, the position of the government that must be substantiallyjustified has been defined to include the underlying governmental actionor failure to act upon which the proceeding is based, as well as the government'sposition in litigation. 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(E). Finally, whether the positionof the agency is substantially justified shall be determined on the basisof the administrative record as a whole made in the adversary adjudicationfor which fees and other expenses are sought. 5 U.S.C. 504(a)(1). The Commission'sregulations (andSection;andSection; 2704.104 and 2704.105) have been amendedto reflect these changes.The Administrative Conference of the United States (``Administrative Conference''),responsible for coordinating the procedural rules adopted by various federalagencies to implement the EAJ Act, issued revised model rules implementingthe amendments to the EAJ Act (51 FR 16659 (May 6, 1986)), after receivingpublic comment on draft model rules (50 FR 46250 (November 6, 1985)). TheCommission's modifications to its regulations conform to the AdministrativeConference's final model rules, although there are three departures.First, the Commission's amended rule revising the effective dates in andSection;2704.102, entitled ``When the Act applies,'' does not provide that theEAJ Act shall apply (1) to adversary adjudications ``pending on or commencedon or after October 1, 1981, in which an application for fees and otherexpenses was timely filed and was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction;''or (2) ``to any adversary adjudication commenced on or after October 1,1984, and finally disposed of before August 5, 1985, provided that an applicationfor fees and expenses * * * has been filed with the agency within 30 daysafter August 5, 1985.'' No Commission cases arose in those situations,and such language would be superfluous.Second, while a literal reading of 5 U.S.C. 504(a)(1) may be interpretedto prohibit discovery or evidentiary proceedings in an EAJ Act applicationcase to determine substantial justification, the legislative history indicatesthat when the proceeding for which fees and expenses are sought was concededby the agency on the merits, withdrawn by the agency, or otherwise settledbefore any of the merits are heard, the administrative record may includeaffidavits and other supporting documents filed by the parties in <T3>both</T3> the fee producing proceeding and the case on the merits.H.R. Rep. No. 120, Part 1, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 13, <T3>reprinted in</T3> 1985 U.S. Code Cong. Ad. News 132, 141. The Commission'samended rule in andSection; 2704.306, entitled ``Further proceedings on theapplication,'' in accord with the intent of Congress reflected in the legislativehistory, permits the applicant and the Secretary of Labor to supplementthe record with affidavits and other supporting documentary evidence, underthe circumstances set forth above, for determining whether the Secretary'sposition was substantially justified. Such supplementation may be necessaryif the underlying record of the settled or withdrawn case is abbreviated.Third, the Commisssion has retained in andSection; 2704.105, entitled ``Standardsfor awards,'' the language that the Secretary may avoid an award by showingher position was ``reasonable in law and fact.'' The Administrative Conferencedeleted the language in question in its model rule, stating that it wasnot certain that the ``reasonable in law and fact'' formulation reflectedCongressional intent and that the case law was unsettled concerning thevalidity of the language in determining whether an agency's position wassubstantially justified. 51 FR 16661. Since the Administrative Conference'smodel rules were published, the Supreme Court has concluded that the phrase``substantially justified'' means ``justified in substance or in the main_thatis justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person''; theCourt explained that this definition is no different from the ``reasonablebasis in law and fact'' formulation adopted by the majority of Courts ofAppeals. <T3>Pierce</T3> v. <T3>Underwood</T3>, <T2>X</T2> U.S. <T2>X</T2>, <T2>X</T2> S. Ct. <T2>X</T2>, 101 L.Ed. 2d 490, 504-05 (1988).One other technical modification to the Commission's regulations deservescomment. The Commission has amended andSection; 2704.104 to provide, in accordancewith the EAJ Act, that an organization described in section 501(c)(3) ofthe Internal Revenue Code of 1954 (26 U.S.C. 501(c)(3)) exempt from taxationunder section 501(a) of the Code may be an eligible party regardless ofthe net worth of such organization. <T3>See</T3> 5 U.S.C. 504(b)(1)(B). Such organizations were also exempt,with respect to net worth, under the EAJ Act as originally authorized andthis rule change corrects a technical discrepancy in the Commission's presentregulations.This rule revises agency regulations of procedure and practice. The AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A), authorizes agencies to revise such regulationsconcerning internal procedures without prior notice or public comment.Because the Commission wishes to put these revised procedures into effectas soon as possible and the rule substantively conforms with the AdministrativeConference's model rules, the Commission adopts these revised regulationsas its final rule. Nevertheless, the Commission values any comments thatthe public may have on these matters. Public comment is accordingly invited.Comments may be mailed to the Commission's Executive Director at the addresspreviously stated. It is requested that comments be filed no later thanMarch 13, 1989. Upon receipt and consideration of any comments, these ruleswill be subject to possible change.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 2704</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Equal access to justice.Accordingly, 29 CFR Part 2704 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 2704_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
