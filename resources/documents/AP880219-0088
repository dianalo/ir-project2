The reductions were sent to Congress on Thursday as part of thebudget's military spending package, which was cut in the effort toreduce federal deficits.   Carlucci said he chose to cut by eliminating some older weaponsand by small decreases in troop strength, rather than by wholesalereductions.   ``What it translates into is a smaller military force,''Carlucci said on NBC-TV's ``Today'' show. ``It clearly means higherrisks. But we have elected to do this rather than hollow out theforce.''   ``We want to maintain good people, adequate readiness, goodsustainability and we want to continue the modernization program ofthose weapons that we consider absolutely essential and we want todo so in the most cost-effective way,'' he said.   Reagan's military budget was praised by lawmakers.   Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga., chairman of the Senate Armed ServicesCommittee, told Carlucci on Thursday that he made ``exactly theright choices.''   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., a critic of past Pentagon budgets,praised Carlucci for a ``very helpful'' budget.   Sen. William Roth, R-Del., said, ``the Pentagon appears to havetaken its responsibility for budget cutting more seriously in thisproposed budget than in those of the past years.''   The budget proposed to authorize $299.5 billion in Pentagonspending for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1, including $294billion that would actually be paid out during the 12-month period.That compares with $291.4 billion authorized for the current year.   The overall Pentagon budget level had been set during talksbetween the administration and Congress last November, when Reaganapproved the $299.5 billion level.   He originally had wanted $332.4 billion, which would have beenan increase after three years of decreased spending. Thosereductions followed large buildups during Reagan's first four yearsin office, when the Pentagon budget doubled as part of Reagan'spledge to ``rearm America.''   In the past eight weeks, Carlucci said, civilian and militaryleaders have made ``hard choices'' to reduce spending by the $33billion needed to reach the $299.5 billion level.   Carlucci said he chose ``a smaller force that was fully ready toperform its mission as opposed to a large force that was not ready.The priorities in this budget were straightforward _ people,readiness and efficient acquisition.''   ``I believe these choices to be not in the best interest of ournational security posture,'' said Carlucci. ``However, I have madethem. They reflect the fiscal realities we face today and myassessment of the direction'' the Pentagon should go.   Adm. William Crowe Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,said ``in a fiscally constrained environment, we had to borrowsomewhat against the future to nourish the deterrent stance we havetoday.''   Among the choices:   _The total strength of the four uniformed services will drop by34,000 men and women, to a total of 2,138,000. The Air Force willtake the largest reduction, accounting for 23,000 of the totalcuts. But Carlucci also called for a 4.3 percent pay hike for thetroops and said the money is needed to keep up the high quality ofrecruits and re-enlistments.   To meet the reductions, the Army plans to cut its brigade ofmotorized infantry at Fort Lewis, Wash., and cancel a previouslyscheduled activation of two light infantry battalions in Alaska.   The Navy will scrap plans to establish a 14th air wing at theMiramar, Calif., Naval Air Station. Sixteen frigates and amissile-firing submarine will be retired and the sailors will besent to other ships. The Air Force will deactivate two fighterwings and start deactivating a third.   Other reductions include Army plans to retire 450 Vietnam-erautility helicopters and 170 scout copters; cancel the troubledAquila surveillance drone program and stop production of Copperheadlaser-guided artillery shells; cancel development of theAnti-Tactical Missile; and develop only one new light helicopterinstead of two.   _Delay development of the single-warhead Midgetmannuclear-tipped missile, but include $200 million to keep theprogram alive until a new administration can decide its fate. Nunnis a supporter of the weapon. Carlucci also proposed putting all100 MX weapons aboard trains, rather than having 50 of the10-warhead weapons aboard trains and the other 50 in land-basedsilos in Wyoming.   _Kill the Air Force anti-satellite weapon, which Congress hadbanned for two years from final-stage testing. The Pentagon hadpushed for continued development of the weapon, but Carlucci saidit was dropped this year because of the continued opposition fromCapitol Hill.</TEXT></DOC>
