 DynaText has the distinction of offering one of the fewfull-text retrieval engines that works with native SGML documents.andM;DynaText (not to be confused with DynoDex, the address book software for theMacintosh) has two main parts: the indexer, which builds the books; and thebrowser, with which users retrieve and read material.andP;  We attended theintroduction of the product at GCA's TechDoc '90, held late in August inWashington, DC.andP;  SoftQuad and Sun Microsystems both served as hosts for EBT,and response was quite favorable.andP;  Several frequent attenders of TechDocdescribed it as the most interesting new product on the exhibit floor.andM;We would not that there were surprisintly few other new products at TechDoc,so it was not hard for EBT to get attention, but we, too, were impressed withDynaText.andM;The indexer.andP;  To build a book, the user must first have a valid SGML documentin minimal syntax (both start and end tags).andP;  The flat ASCII file is compiledby the software, which builds an element list.andP;  The element list is used tocreate a stylesheet for the formatting of each element ont he screen.andP;  Oncethis step is complete, the user then initiates the batch process of buildingthe index.andP;  A DTD is not required, but when it is known, it simplifies theprocess of creating the stylesheet used to format the document when retreivedin the browser.andM;Unlike most full-text indexes, which do not pay attention to context, theDynaText indexer notes the position of every element in the documenthierarchy.andP;  That information is used to create a table-of-contents view ofthe document in the browser.andM;The indexing and retrieval engine in DynaText and licensed from BrownUniversity.andP;  It is based on the engine of InterLex, the online AmericanHeritage Dictionary accessory to Brown University's IRIS Intermedia, themultiuser hypertext system that we reviewed a year ago (see Vol.andP;  18, No.andO;21).andP;  IRIS's engine indexes every word of the dictionary, giving it a uniquenumerical identification.andP;  When a word matches the user's search criteria,the Id is used as the pointer for retrieving the correct portion of thedocument.andP;  The engine uses generic markup of the manuscript, which identifieseach element by its content.andM;EBT licensed Brown's source code and modified it for use with any SGMLdocument that contains full, explicit markup (both begin and end tags).andP;  Theengine indexes every word of a document with respect to its location place inthe hierarchy and element type.andP;  (The user may edit the list of &quot;stop&quot;words--those thot are not indexed.)andP;  When the user initiates a woard search,DynaText reports not only how many times the word is found, but how manytimes within each chapter (and section, sub-section, etc., as far down asthere are head).andP;  In this respect, it differs from most full-text systems,which ontly identify the total number of hits.andM;As part of the licensing agreement, Brown University was granted acampus-wide license to DynaText.andM;Entity references (shortcuts and references to external objects) andattributes are also noted and may be used in interesting ways.andP;  For example,security attributes might be used to hide portions of a document.andP;  (Thestylesheet would indicate that any element with a given security attributewould not be displayed.)andP;  Entity references could trigger the generation ofhypertext links to objects external to the document.andM;The resulting index is quite large--right now it is often five to seven timesas large as the source material; EBT hopes to use compression to bring itdown closer to two to three times the original file.andP;  The advantage,though,is obtaining an index that is much richer in its information thanthose of most full-text systems.andP;  The richness is evident when you go to lookup something in the browser.andM;The browser.andP;  Once a book has been created, the browsing software is used toretrieve and view text, tables and pictures.andP;  The user interface currently isMotif, but EBT says it will have an Open Look version in a few weeks.andP;  Thesoftware relies on X intrinsics, which makes it easy to develop versions fora variety of Unix platforms rapidly.andM;Each document has at least two views.andP;  One is the display of the main text,formatted according to a stylesheet.andP;  The second view is a table of contents,with hypertext links between each head and its place in the source file thatare automatically generated by DynaText during the indexing process.andO;Clicking on any item in the contents scrolls the assocaited text view to thecorresponding section.andM;The contents view is an expandable/collapsible outline: you decide the levelof granularity and the system tells you if there are further subheads belowwhat is displayed (see photo).andM;If what your are looking for is not apparent from the contents heads, EBToffers a full-text search tool.andP;  This is a single menu in which you specify aword, phrase or partial word through the use of wildcards.andP;  After a search isinitiated, DynaText finds all of the matches and then reports the number ofmatches within each section of the contents (see phote).andP;  This report givesthe user some feel not only for how often a subject is mentioned in the text,but because it is an outline of a document, it also makes a nice way ofskimming the heads in which a word is found before you follow the link to themain text.andP;  Thus, you know some of the surrounding context (chapter andsection heads, for example) before you go to the text textual reference.andM;In effect, EBT's browser combines index and contents into one tool.andP;  Welikecd the implications.andP;  In the example EBT demostrated, a bike mechanicmight be fixing the brake calipers.andP;  Searching on caliper reveals severaldozen hits in the manual, but the mechanic can quickly scan the headings ofsections in which caliper is mentioned to see which one might contain thedesired material.andP;  In this way, the search mechanism applies a user-definedfilter to the contents page.andM;If the filter doesn't help (no sections are obvious choices), the viewer maystill look at each reference, much like looking up each page citation from aconventional index (but without the additional context phrase that good bookindexes provide).andM;Dyna Text's search tool could be improved, though.andP;  It is not case-sensitive,nor does it offer boolean logic or repetitive &quot;zeroed-in&quot; searches as istupical of most full-text systems.andP;  so, for example, it is not possible toinitiate a series of queties that narrow the criteria (e.g.m first brake,then caliper in addition to brake).andM;Based partly on research that shows that most users do not benefitsubstantially from boolean logic, EBT hasn't given a shigh priority to addingboolean operands to the program, Although thoy will come in time.andP;  Meanwhile,it is planning to add a thesaurus that will allow the user to placesystem-generated synonyms or user-defined ones in the search field along withthe main term.andM;While not as powerful as Verity's Topic, the thesaurus approach would bequite flexible and would not required any setup time, as Topic does to beused most effectively.andM;Format on the fly.andP;  Like Intermedia, DynaText was designed as an electronicbook.andP;  You may format for hard copy if you like (for PostScript devices), butits stylesheet controls were designed for formatting on a computer screen.andO;For example, DynaText displays all body copy in one column that automaticallywraps to fit the width of the book window.andP;  Resizing a window causes the textto rewrap to the new width.andP;  A two-column format is not appropriate in thisschema because it greatly inhibits scrolling through a file.andM;The style of the book is not fancy, but DynaText lets you use whateverX-based fonts are in the system, with bold and italic variations, in avariety of sizes.andP;  It does not offer typographic effects such as droppedinitials, but it does handle footnotes.andM;One knotty problem is tables.andP;  All multicolumn material (even two-columnunnumbered listss) must be separated in the source file as tabular material,coded appropriately in SGML.andP;  Each table then becomes its own minidocumentobject that is retrieved within its own window.andP;  DynaText will then use thecross-reference t the table in the main text to generate a hypertext linkbetween text and table.andP;  The stylesheet determines how the link acts (onedirection only at this time) and its representation on the screen (what iconis used and where it is placed in relation to the text, usually in themargin).andM;Graphics are handled in a similar fashion.andP;  All graphics must be digitized asraster files, which are stored individually.andP;  Cross-references toillustrations in the text generate hypertext links to the pictures and, ifnecessary, captions.andM;As a document is called to the screen, it is formatted on the fly accordingto the stylesheet in effect.andP;  Through the use of multiple stylesheets, it ispossible to call up the same document in two different styles simultaneously(see photo).andM;Because of the way the stylesheet is implemented, it is possible to attachscripts to the style of any element.andP;  For example, the graphics style has ascript for invoking a raster display program when the file is opened.andP;  EBTallows virtually any command that may be executed within the Unix C-shell tobe invoked wihin a style.andP;  I addition, it has defined an applicationprogramming interface for calling DynaText from another application.andP;  Thisprogrammability leaves DynaText open to the possibility of other types ofcontent than what it now supports.andP;  The architecture would support the use ofother types of graphics, video or sound as content.andM;Another interesting aspect of EBT's stylesheets is the fact that they arewritten in SGML syntax.andP;  This is only the second system we know of to useSGML for both its style and content syntax.andP;  (ArborText's The Publisher isthe firsts.)andP;  EBT's chief architect, Dr. Steven DeRose, has been followingclosely the recent developments in theandM;standards community.andP;   The use ofandM;SGML for writing stylesheets will enable EBT to conform to DSSSL, the CALSand ATA-100 output specifications and other emerging formatting interchangestandards with little difficulty.andP;  It also will be consistent with HyTime,the new application of SGML for time-dependent content (opera, broadcasts,etc.).andM;At the moment, the one drawback to DynaText's stylesheets is the lack of auser interface for making adjustments within DynaText itself.andP;  The stylesheetis a flat ASCII file that you may be edited using any text editor you like,but there are no on-screen clues (i.e., menues or dialog boxes) as to whatthe appropriated choices might be.andP;  (There is, of course, the manual!)andO;ArborText has done a nice job in this area; we hope DynaText will also offeran unobtrusive means to create and alter the sytle of DynaText books withinits own pregram.andM;Application.andP;  EBT believes that its product has broad potential, but it isfirst targetting large manufacturers that have field service personnel.andP;  Forsuch a firm, lessening the burden of keeping the documentation current amongits field force, and making it easier for the field force to use a largedocument set, can result in substantial cost savings and productivityimprovements.andP;  In the past, creating such electronic information meant havingto commit the information repository to one vendor's format.andP;  With DynaText,it is feasible to keep a source library in a very portable, independent formand still be able to produce electronic books.andM;Company background.andP;  EBT was founded last year by Louis Reynolds formerlyvice president of marketing for Cadre Technologies, which makescomputer-aided software engineering (CASE) tools.andP;  Reynolds decided the timewas right to put in practice the concept of electronic books.andP;  That term wascoined in the mid-1960s by Andries van Dam, the founder of the ComputerScience Department at Brown University and a pioneer in the field ofhypertext reserach for more than two decades.andP;  A friend of Reynolds, van Damintroduced Reynolds to Dr. Steven DeRose and Jeff Vogel, both Browngraduates.andP;  DeRose, the senior architect of DynaText, has considerableexperience with both SGML and hypertext.andP;  He was part of the team thatdeveloped the Brown Fress system, the forerunner to IRI's Intermedia.andP;  On theSGML side, he currently leads a subcommittee of the Text Encoding Initiative,a project for encoding multilingual documents in SGML syntax.andP;  Vogel, thelead engineer, helped develop a graphical software environment based on XWindow that is currently in use at the Brown computer science department.andM;Professor van Dam is associated with the firm as chairman of its technicaladvisory board.andM;First impressions.andP;  Overall, DynaText made an impressive debut.andP;  It stillneeds some refinement in the user interface, but its underpinnings appearsound.andP;  At the show, EBT was put to the test by a man from the ForeignService Information Bureau, who brought in an SGML file the FSIB had created.andO;EBT was able to create an electronic book of the material in about half anhour.andP;  EBT successfully took files from the CALS Test Network as well,including tabular matter.andM;In combination with an authoring and validating environment, such as thosefrom SoftQuad of Exorterica, DynaText brings electronic publishing fromwithin SGML nearly up to the level of sophistication that vendors such asInterleaf have been providing within their own software.andP;  With its open-endedapproach to data types, EBT hopes to encourage VARs to develop multimediaapplications that would bring DynaText to a comparable level in functionalityto what can be achieved within proprietary data formats.andM;We believe that, given a choice, users will move large electronic librariesto the most portable form available, as long as they don't have to sacrificefunctionality and the overhead is not too much more than it would be if theyconverted to one vendor's format.andP;  Until recently, SGML was viewed only as aninterchange standard because there were few commercial software tools thatused it for anything else and because few companies were actively trying todeliver documents in electronic form.andM;As the push to be able to deliver documents electronically increases, therewill be incresing incentives to prepare for an all-electronic approach topublishing.andP;  Certainly, some additional documents analysis and encodingeffort will be necessary to make an electronic database more than acollection of pages.andP;  But products such as EBT's DynaText may make the extracoding effort worthwhile.andM;Currently undergoing testing at twosites, the Sun Unix version of DynaText isslated for release late this year.andP;  The anticipated price is $10,000 for theability to create 1,000 different books with the indexer.andP;  The Unix versionsof the browser will be offered on floating licenses, beginning at $2,500 forfive simultaneous users.andP;  Any X-terminal device may be used for browsing.andP;  APC version of DynaText running under Microsoft Windowa is under developmentand is planned for release in the spring of 1991.andP;  PC-based browsers will besold per workstation, with prices starting at $250 per seat.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
