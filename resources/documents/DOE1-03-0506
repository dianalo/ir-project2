The analysis coversevents from the late 1940s up to June 1986. More specifically, this studyexplores the validity of the widespread allegation that the Japanesesteel mills act as oligopsonists in the coking coal market. In conclusion,this study suggests that, although the coking coal market is characterizedby oligopsony, the nature of the market, in particular the potentialfor significant technological change, virtually preclude the introductionof effective antioligopsony policies. Nevertheless, the study also servesto draw attention to a policy issue which has largely escaped seriouspublic discussion in market economies. In their increasing desire toderegulate markets and to rely on the private sector to generate growth,governments should not lose sight of the fact that some export marketsmay not be conducive to individual selling activities. That is, collectiveaction may, in certain situations, be the preferred strategy to followif market oriented economies are to maximize the economic benefits availablefrom the exploitation of their nonrenewable resource base. However, thisstudy suggests that the coking coal market, as it now exists should notbe a candidate for such action.</TEXT></DOC>
