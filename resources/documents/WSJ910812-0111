Since &quot;joint legalcustody . . . is granted in up to 80% of divorce cases,&quot; thisdoes not mean that all arrangements follow the patternoutlined in your article, nor should the concept beabandoned.   I believe custody arrangements of the 1990s are more inline with mine. My daughter is now five years old and hasbeen the basis of a joint-custody arrangement for almostthree years. Neither my ex-wife nor myself has any intentionof revisiting the courtroom to solve our differences. Mydaughter visits me every other weekend and up to twoadditional weeks during the year. I talk to her by phone,often two or more times a week for anywhere from 10 secondsto 15 minutes; it's her choice (yes, a five-year-old can havea lot to say).</LP><TEXT>   All of this has not damped my daughter's good-natured,happy-go-lucky attitude. She smiles and laughs a lot, whetherwith me or her mother. Yes, I miss her, but I know I cannotparticipate in her day-to-day life. I can, however, continueto be a meaningful part of it.   Howard A.
