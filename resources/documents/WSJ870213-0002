But he'll face the same old skeptical airline analysts at the company's big meeting next week in New York.    Analysts expect Mr. Ferris to have some news next Thursday, perhaps travel packages, discount fares, airline cost-savings or a corporate name change. But the issue is whether UAL can make it as a travel company, they say.    Over the past year, Mr. Ferris has spent large sums of money on acquisitions. While other airlines sought to be bigger carriers of people and goods, UAL set out to be a one-stop travel supermarket -- flying people on United Airlines and renting them Hertz cars and Westin or Hilton International hotel accommodations.    Mr. Ferris, who rose through Westin's ranks, hasn't convinced the crowd that UAL is the company of the future. UAL, which closed yesterday at 57 3/8, is up only 25% from its 1986 low and is one of the cheaper airline stocks. Texas Air, having overtaken United Airlines in size by swallowing other airlines, is up almost 250%. AMR is up almost 50%.    Mr. Ferris isn't the first to try to mesh an airline and hotel chain. Transworld tried, but ended up spinning off its airline unit. UAL's travel concept &quot;might be the greatest thing since sliced bread,&quot; says Timothy Pettee, analyst at Bear Stearns, &quot;or it might be a bust.&quot;    Travel packages aren't new, money managers note. They're currently offered to vacationers and business travelers by agents and airlines that don't own car-rental companies or hotels. UAL's purchase of Hertz and Hilton might deprive it of some business from their competitors, they add.    Mr. Ferris's travel concept has been costly. UAL paid $588 million for Hertz in 1985 and recently agreed to pay $980 million for Transworld's Hilton International unit. In 1986, it paid $750 million for Pan Am's Pacific routes -- double the going rate for recent airline transactions, analysts say.    Julius Maldutis of Salomon Brothers figures UAL paid $1 billion above &quot;fair market value&quot; for the businesses. Its returns might be negligible for a couple of years, he says.    Mr. Ferris could have bought UAL stock or an airline like TWA Corp. instead of Hertz and Hilton International, some money managers say. If UAL had stuck to its knitting, they add, it wouldn't have had so much competition in Denver from Continental Airlines. The formerly troubled Texas Air unit might not have survived had UAL matched its cut rates in earlier years, says one portfolio manager.    Some people think Mr. Ferris spent all that money partly to make UAL immune to raiders or acquirers. The executive is said to have rejected a proposal in 1985 to take the company private. At the time, analysts valued UAL's assets at 30% to 50% above the stock price. Costly acquisitions have killed UAL's appeal as a play on &quot;break-up&quot; values, says Salomon's Mr. Maldutis.    So far, UAL's purchases have had mixed results. In the fast-growing but cutthroat Pacific market, UAL lost $78 million in the first nine months of 1986, partly because of maintenance and refurbishing costs. Hertz's U.S. car rentals rose marginally in 1986 to 12.7 million from 12.4 million in 1985, says Nancy Hobor, UAL's investor relations officer.    Mr. Ferris couldn't be reached for comment. Ms. Hobor says greater synergies will emerge as UAL starts more fly-drive-sleep programs. Mr. Ferris's &quot;strategic vision&quot; was &quot;driving the acquisitions,&quot; she says. UAL paid $588 million for Hertz, which has a 33% share of airport car-rentals. National, with a 20% share, was recently bought for $460 million, she adds.    Hilton International might not be a bad buy, says Lee Isgur, a PaineWebber entertainment analyst; its foreign-currency profit will help UAL if the dollar keeps falling. Eventually, he adds, the UAL-Hertz-Hilton link will be used to sell profitable tour and convention packages. Currently, airlines offer so many confusing flight plans that few customers reserve a car and hotel at the same time, he says.    Helane Becker, a Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst, is bullish on UAL. Citing big layoffs at United Airlines recently, she says similar cost savings in the future could return the airline unit to &quot;sustainable profitability&quot; after two years of losses.    Historically, Mr. Ferris and other UAL executives haven't had much of a relationship with airline analysts. Thursday's meeting will be the first ever sponsored by UAL for analysts. The company tried but apparently had little success in attracting some hotel analysts -- who might like the travel concept.    ---   UAL   (NYSE; Symbol: UAL)   Business: Airlines, hotels and car and truck rentals.
