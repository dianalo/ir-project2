Vittorio Cassoni, former president, ATandamp;T-Data SystemsDivision, (a.k.a., ATandamp;T-Computer Systems Group) from Senior Vice President inNovember 1986, through May, 1988 when he left, as president, to go back withOlivetti.andM;We had the distinct pleasure of meeting with Mr. Cassoni many times duringhis ATandamp;T tenure.andP;  We mourned his loss for the future of ATandamp;T's ComputerSystems operation, many times.andM;WHY CASSONI? As we said many times in the past, Cassoni is a man of visionand a man who knows and understands technology.andP;  He was an early-onproselytizer of Open Systems.andP;  He gave Open Systems its name when manythought it was just another ATandamp;T catch phrase.andP;  And Open Systems is what NCRis about.andM;He was a leader at ATandamp;T Computer Systems Group who UNDERSTOOD computerarchitecture, (he layed out the presentations and presented them to toughmedia audiences, answering detailed questions, on the fly, whereas his twopredecessors had to be taught and rehearsed, as did his successor).andP;  Hecouldn't be snowed by so-called technocrats.andM;He was known well by chairman Bob Allen and today's Computer Systems head,Bob Kavner, who worked closely with Cassoni and has yet to fully comprehendthe marketing savvy Cassoni brought to ATandamp;T.andP;  He is also known well andhighly respected by Scott McNealy, chairman of Sun Microsystems.andP;  He servedfor a while as ATandamp;T's representative on Sun's board, until he left ATandamp;T andwas replaced by Kavner, who has since resigned from Sun's board.andP;  And notnecessarily at his own initiative as ATandamp;T has previously indicated.andP;  Cassoniand McNealy got on well and ATandamp;T.andM;And ATandamp;T owns 19.5 percent of multi-$Billion Sun Microsystems.andP;  Sun productscommand the largest share of the computer industry's fastest growing marketsegment (workstations and servers).andM;When Cassoni left ATandamp;T to return to Olivetti, Kavner took over the ComputerSystems operation and proclaimed it would become profitable.andP;  He was to buildon Cassoni's turn around effort.andP;  And over a year ago, Bob Allen stated thatKavner would finish the job.andP;  He hasn't.andM;Few of us who met Bob Kavner in New York that transition andamp; good-by week,thought he could.andP;  At one of those meetings, Kavner said he would succeedwithout Cassoni because he (Kavner) &quot;understood what the business communitywanted in a computer company.&quot;andP;  As we said at the time, what the businesscommunity wants from a computer manufacturer is a clear picture of thecomputer company's direction.andP;  If the manufacturer can present and sell thatdirection while being perceived as knowledgeable, reliable and financiallystrong enough to lead the way to the future, then the business community willreward the manufacturer.andM;Kavner's background was a financial background, not a computer industrymarketeering background, with all of the innovative and bold, but disciplinedthought, required of this business.andM;WHY CASSONI LEFT ATandamp;T Prior to joining ATandamp;T, Cassoni was hired by Olivettichairman Carlo DeBenedetti from IBM.andM;When he joined ATandamp;T in November of 1986 (shortly after ATandamp;T's $16.4 millioninvestment in Olivetti), he was still an employee of Olivetti, on loan toATandamp;T.andM;When Olivetti fell upon difficult times in Europe, and ATandamp;T refused to makeany further investment in Olivetti, chairman DeBenedetti.andP;  recalled Cassonito Ivrea headquarters.andM;In summary, Vittorio Cassoni would make an excellent president of a newATandamp;T-NCR Corp.andP;  He solves the problems of high-level personality (ATandamp;T, Sunand chairman Allen), he has global contacts knowledge and respect in thecomputer industry and he understands the nature of ATandamp;T's vision of GlobalInformation Movement and Management, perhaps better than anyone at ATandamp;T.andM;BACKGROUND Cassoni has a Masters Degree in Electrical Engineering and isfluent in Italian, English an French.andP;  He has held senior assignmentsmanaging Latin America, Australia, Scandinavian, European and North Americancountries.andP;  He has contacts.andM;He started his computer industry career with IBM, managing a plant in Italyin 1967.andP;  He held various assignments with IBM in Manufacturing, Randamp;D (heparticipated in the development of the IBM System 3) and Communications.andP;  Heleft IBM in 1980 as of IBM Europe Headquarters Area One.andP;  He oversaw theemployment of over 6,000 personnel and over $600 million in revenue.andM;He joined Olivetti in 1980 as Assistant to the Corporate Vice PresidentMarketing Sales.andM;By 1985, Cassoni was President, Olivetti Management of America, whichcomprised all of North America for Olivetti.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
