He said it's possible Libya still may be able to producechemical weapons at the plant 60 miles southwest of Tripoli.   ``Important uncertainties remain regarding both the cause andextent of the damage at Rabta,'' said Boucher. ``Therefore nodefinitive conclusions have been reached.''   U.S. officials have received intelligence reports indicatingthat the fire might have been set by Gadhafi's agents to make itappear that their chemical weapons program had been put out ofaction, The New York Times and The Washington Post reported intoday's editions.   One report said truckloads of tires were brought to the plantand ignited on Gadhafi's orders, the newspapers reported.   Boucher called for the dismantling of Rabta, without regard tohow that was achieved.   Defense Secretary Dick Cheney, at a meeting of the Associationof American Publishers here Friday, also said the plant was stillthere.   ``It still has, presumably, some residual capabilities. How muchit was damaged, obviously, we don't know yet. That's something thatwe'll look at very carefully,'' Cheney said during aquestion-and-answer session.   Before the March 14 fire, U.S. intelligence analysts hadconcluded the plant was producing poison gas and nerve gas agents,as well as canisters to carry the deadly weapons to their targets.   The day after the blaze, the White House and State Departmentsaid the plant appeared to be out of operation.   ``We don't know the origins of the fire,'' said White Housepress secretary Marlin Fitzwater. ``We don't know if it wassabotage. ... Somebody could have knocked over a kerosene lamp orsomething.''   Gadhafi blamed the fire on West Germany, while the Libyan newsagency, reporting two deaths in the blaze, suggested a U.S.-Israeliplot.   U.S. officials declined to say whether the new assessmentreflected a closer look at the facility, presumably by satellites,or whether Libya, with or without outside assistance, was able tomanage some reconstruction.   ``The U.S. government is reviewing all available evidence,''Boucher said. ``Important uncertainties remain regarding both thecause and the extent of damage at Rabta. Therefore no definitiveconclusions have been reached.''   He then added dramatically: ``The possibility remains that Libyacan still produce chemical warfare agents.''   About two dozen countries, including the United States and theSoviet Union, are known to have the capability to produce chemicalweapons. None causes more concern to the U.S. government than Libya.   Gadhafi has been accused of sponsoring terrorist attacks againstU.S. and Israeli citizens and facilities. In retaliation, theUnited States bombed Tripoli and Benghazi in April 1986.   However, President Bush and other U.S. officials denied anyinvolvement in the Rabta fire, which occurred a week after theWhite House called for ``vigorous efforts'' to halt operations atthe plant.   CIA Director William Webster once described the plant as theworld's largest chemical weapons factory. Gadhafi, however, hascontended it produced pharmaceuticals.</TEXT></DOC>
