Nationally-circulated newspapers and televison news here saidNakasone told a news conference in New York in October 1985 thatNippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp. would buy a supercomputer fromthe United States.   Nakasone, prime minister between 1982 and 1987, told reportersFeb. 27 he knew nothing in advance about the supercomputer deal,which is linked to widening stock scandal involving scores of publicofficials.   The inconsistency of his statements likely will worsen apolitical deadlock in the administration of Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita and increase opposition pressure for Takeshita to resign,analysts said.   Nakasone released a statement saying his 1985 comments in NewYork was the result of a misunderstanding.   ``I think I made the statement based on my memory of news reportsback then,'' it said. ``The trade friction between Japan and theUnited States was at its critical stage then and I wanted to showour willingness to buy supercomputers made by Cray Research.''   The scandal-ridden NTT purchased a supercomputer made byMinneapolis-based Cray Research Inc. in May 1986 and resold it inDecember to Recruit Co., a publishing conglomerate at the center ofthe massive stock-trading scandal.   Opposition parties charge that Nakasone directed NTT to buy aU.S.-made supercomputer and sell it to Recruit amid the frictionbetween Tokyo and Washington over access to the supercomuter market.   The parliamentary session on the 1989 fiscal year's budget hasbeen stalled since Wednesday when the government and the governingLiberal Democratic Party rejected opposition demands to callNakasone to Parliament for questioning.   Nakasone was among 159 politicians, business leaders andbureaucrats who bought bargain-priced stocks in Recruit-Cosmos, asubsidiary of Recruit, before the shares went public.   Buyers earned handsome profits when the company was made publicshortly afterward and share prices shot up.   Three Cabinet ministers have stepped down since December becauseof their link in the Recruit scandal and the administration'spopularity ratings have hit their lowest levels since Takeshita tookoffice in November 1987.   Prosecutors have arrested 10 corporate executives and publicofficials for bribery and securities law violations. More arrestsare expected.   Opposition lawmakers investigating the scandal charged Nakasonewas heavily involved. Three of Nakasone's aides earned more than$465,000 in profits from the stock deal.   NTT, the former public telecommunications utility, was privatizedin 1985. Three NTT executives, including ex-chairman Hisashi Shinto,were arrested for taking bribes from Recruit.   NTT, the largest company in the world in terms of stock values,announced Friday that in a gesture of public regret it will cut thesalaries of 35 executives next month up to 20 percent for six months.</TEXT></DOC>
