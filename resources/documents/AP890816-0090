The Christian army commander, Gen. Michel Aoun, ``welcomeswithout any conditions the U.N. Security Council resolution,'' saidan Aoun spokesman, who demanded anonymity.   ``The resolution, as we understand it, is a package deal thatinvolves not just a cease-fire, but also the lifting of blockadesand planning the Syrian military pull-out from Lebanon,'' thespokesman added.   The spokesman did not elborate, and it was unclear if Aoun'swelcoming of the truce was tantamount to accepting it.   The U.N. resolution made no direct references to Syria or itsblockade of the embattled Christian enclave. But it called on ``allthe parties to put an immediate end to all operations and to allfiring and shelling on land and at sea.'' The resolution also calledfor ``the opening of the lines of communication and the lifting ofthe sieges.''   There was little fighting in Beirut today after heavy artillerybattles on Tuesday.   Aoun's statement was issued one day after the Syrian army andMoslem factions vowed to join forces to defeat the Christians.Sources today reported a buildup of troops and ammunition around theChristian heartland.   There was no reaction to the U.N. cease-fire demand from Syrianand Moslem forces. The 15-nation Security Council had called for thetruce during an emergency meeting ordered by Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar.   Arab League ministers also renewed their call for an end to thefighting. Arab League committee members King Hassan II of Morocco,King Fahd Bin Abdul-Aziz Saud of Saudi Arabia and Algerian PresidentChadli Benjedid called in a statement for ``an immediate andglobal'' cease-fire.   Police said 19 people had been killed and 104 wounded in thefighting since Tuesday, when Christian forces fought Syrian troopswith tanks and artillery along the southern, eastern and northernedges of the Christian enclave north of Beirut.   Syrian gunners also pounded the 28-mile-long Christian coastline,the only escape route for the area's residents.   By police count, 760 people have been killed and 2,050 woundedsince the latest round of fighting in Lebanon's civil war beganMarch 8.   Since then, shelling day and night has largely destroyed Beirutand driven out 90 percent of the city's 1.5 million residents.   The fighting between the 20,000 mostly Christian troops underarmy Aoun and Syria's 40,000 soldiers slackened early today tointermittent shelling.   But Moslem security sources speaking on condition of anonymitysaid the Syrians were reinforcing their troops opposite Aoun's linesin Beirut, the central mountains and northern Lebanon.   One source said, ``Syrian trucks were observed early in the daybringing in troops and ammunition to positions facing Aoun's lines.''   He said Druse warlord Walid Jumblatt's Progressive SocialistParty and Palestinian guerrilla groups from Col. Saeed Mousa'sFatah-Uprising, bankrolled by Syria, also sent reinforcements totheir positions in the wooded mountains southeast of Beirut.   The buildup began after a seven-hour meeting in Damascus of theheads of virtually all Lebanon's fractious Moslem groups.   The Syrians summoned their Moslem and leftist Lebanese militialeaders to Damascus for a council of war in what appeared to be amove to escalate the campaign against the Christians.   The leaders of 16 factions, including Iranian-backed Shiitegroups and radical Palestinian guerrillas, attended. They issued astatement late Tuesday saying they would close ranks to bring downAoun.   ``The solution must be on the basis of ending the Israelioccupation, and blowing up the sectarian regime from its roots,'' itsaid. ``But to bring down Aoun is the priority, as well as blowingup all the imaginary red lines.''   The border of the Christian enclave is often referred to as a``red line'' that would provoke international intervention ifcrossed by Syrian forces because it would represent a majorescalation in the fighting.   Syria has used its militia allies to do most of the groundfighting while Syrian artillery and armor provide support, givingDamascus room for diplomatic maneuvering.   International pressure was building for a cease-fire.   Pope John Paul II said Tuesday from Castelgondolfo, Italy: ``Inthe name of God, I turn to the Syrian authorities, asking them tostop the bombardment that aims to destroy ... the whole country.''   Perez de Cuellar called the emergency U.N. meeting when none ofthe Security Council's 15 member nations acted.   The U.N. charter allows the secretary-general to call suchmeetings when international security appears in serious danger.</TEXT></DOC>
