San Juan, because it is close to the oil-free waters of theocean, has the best chance of any to survive and produce the pinksalmon needed to replenish the oil-killed stocks, Lamb said Monday.   That's why 25 fishing boats and sleepless crews from the fishingtown of Cordova are struggling to hold back the huge river of crudeoil coursing past the bay.   The fishermen, increasingly equipped with booms, oil vacuums,and supply vessels from the state and Exxon, have laid four milesof boom across the bay since they started a week ago.   Still, currents pushed oil against the booms Monday, and a lightsheen made its way past outer barriers.   Al Rule is among the fishermen who move along the booms inskiffs, keeping them lined up against the oil.   ``This hatchery is our meat and potatoes,'' said Rule, ``so Iknow we got to save it. ...   ``But I still think about what I'd be doing if there wasn't anoil spill and I wasn't doing this. I'd be fishin' right now, I'd beherring fishing if it wasn't shut. That's my spring money, mystart-up money there, and that's what I'd like to be doing.''   The fierce determination of people like Rule is the reason SanJuan will survive the oil tide, predicted Al Kegler, the stateDepartment of Environmental Conservation official helping theefforts.   ``We'll make the booms hold and we'll beat the oil.''   The hatchery, nestled alongside rickety gray wooden docks in thesound's southwest corner, is one of five hatcheries that supply anaverage of 50 percent of the millions of pink salmon that surgeeach summer through the sound.   Lamb said only San Juan has a chance now.   The others, further north in a chain of islands, will suffer dueto their distance from clean ocean waters. Their hundreds ofmillions of salmon fry must feed and swim much further through oil,and have less chance of surviving, he said.   Even small amounts of the toxic oil can poison the fry.   ``San Juan is the linchpin of the salmon fishery here,'' Lambsaid.   Other fisheries, meanwhile, are quietly shutting down for theyear, victims of the spill.   The last casualty came Monday when the state Department of Fishand Game closed the region's $12 million to $15 million herringseason. Last week, the sablefish and shrimp fisheries were shut.Officials have until May 1 to decide on releasing the salmon fry.The salmon runs begin in late June and early July.   Frank Gurske of nearby Chenega Bay thinks it will take more thanone hatchery to save the fishery, much less his way of life.   ``Nobody's going to buy the fish. They'll be scared of theoil,'' he said.   Gurske, who lays boom now, is a fisherman married into an Alaskanative family.   ``We go hunting seals to sell to make our income in the winter.We catch halibut, bottomfish, salmon that we put up for the winter.We go out and get our meat, our deer. Now all this is going to stopbecause of the oil spill. This thing is going to hurt all life outthere,'' Gurske said.   Clomping along the dock in heavily oiled boots, he said: ``Idon't know what's going to happen. ... Now we're going to have tobuy the food, and we don't know how we'll do it.   ``It's a mess.''</TEXT></DOC>
