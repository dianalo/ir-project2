A 28-page report released by the coalition called for Dukakis tosupport the sanctions as well as recognize the Marxist governmentin Angola and to end aid to the South African-supported rebel groupUNITA in Angola.   ``The Democratic Party can lose with our support, (but) theycannot win without it,'' said Randall Robinson, head of theanti-apartheid group TransAfrica, in making the announcementThursday. ``So all those who turned out in the black community forthe primary must turn out for Michael Dukakis if he has any chanceof the White House. There is a price for that turnout.''   The report was authored and supported by the Congressional BlackCaucus, the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Nonviolent SocialChange, the National Association for the Advancement of ColoredPeople, the National Council of Negro Women and the SouthernChristian Leadership Conference.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Dukakis Campaign Names National Press Secretary</HEAD><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dayton Duncan, a former deputy press secretary to1984 Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale, has been namednational press secretary for Democratic front-runner MichaelDukakis.
