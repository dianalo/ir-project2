Accordingly, it is theNRC's policy to cooperate fully with State governments as they seek torespond to the expectations of their citizens that their health and safetybe protected and that there be minimal impact on the environment as a resultof activities licensed by the NRC. In accordance with this policy statement,the NRC will keep Governor-appointed State Liaison Officers routinely informedon matters of interest to the States, and NRC will respond in a timelymanner to State requests for information and State recommendations concerningmatters within NRC's regulatory jurisdiction. If requested, the NRC willroutinely inform State Liaison Officers of public meetings between theNRC and its licensees and applicants, in order that State representativesmay attend as observers, and NRC will allow State observation of NRC inspectionactivities. The NRC will consider State proposals to enter into instrumentsof cooperation for State participation in NRC inspection activities whenthese programs have provisions to ensure close cooperation with NRC. TheNRC will not consider State proposals for instruments of cooperation toconduct independent inspection programs of NRC-regulated activities withoutclose cooperation with, and oversight by, the NRC. This policy statementis intended to provide a uniform basis for NRC/State cooperation as itrelates to the regulatory oversight of commercial nuclear power plantsand other nuclear production or utilization facilities. Instruments ofcooperation between the NRC and the States, approved prior to the effectivedate of this policy statement will continue to be honored by the NRC.The Commission invites interested States, licensees, applicants, and membersof the public to comment on the policy before it becomes final agency policy.The comment period will expire 30 days following the date of publicationin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The proposed policy will be followed in theinterim, except for those paragraphs in the policy statement and Implementationsection dealing with State proposals for instruments of cooperation forparticipation in inspections and inspection entrance and exit meetings.The Commission will not act on these specific types of State-proposed instrumentsof cooperation until the comment period expires and the policy statementis published as a final policy statement.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>The comment period expires on July 13, 1988.

Background</ITAG>The Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (the Act) was amended in 1959 to add section274, ``Cooperation With States''. Section 274 of the Act provides the statutorybasis for NRC/State cooperation in nuclear matters and prescribes the frameworkfor State regulation of certain nuclear materials and facilities. The focusof section 274 is primarily on protecting the public from radiologicalhazards of source, byproduct, and special nuclear materials below criticalmass. Under section 274, the Federal Government, primarily NRC, is assignedexclusive authority and responsibility to regulate the radiological andnational security aspects of the construction and operation of any nuclearproduction or utilization facility, except for certain authority over airemissions granted to States by the Clean Air Act.The NRC has had extensive formal and informal interaction with the Statesthroughout its history. The Agreement State Program, under section 274bof the Act, is an example of a formal program where the NRC relinquishesits regulatory authority over certain radioactive materials to the States.There are currently 29 Agreement States regulating approximately 65 percentof those licensees nationwide that use or manufacture those types of radioactivematerial. The Agreement State Program operates under two Commission PolicyStatements, one for entering into section 274b agreements and one for periodicallyreviewing Agreement State radiation control programs for adequacy in protectingpublic health and safety and for compatibility with NRC programs. Thispolicy statement supports continuation of the Agreement State Program andis not meant to affect it.This policy statement is not intended to affect rights to notice and toparticipate in hearings granted to States by statute or NRC regulations.Under 10 CFR Part 9, Subpart D, the NRC has provided procedures for handlingrequests for an NRC representative to participate or provide informationin judicial or quasi-judicial proceedings conducted by States or othercourts and agencies. This policy statement supports these procedures anddoes not affect them.Under 10 CFR 50.55a, the NRC has recognized the role of the States withinthe American Society of Mechanical Engineers' Boiler and Pressure VesselCode (ASME Code) System. This policy statement does not affect the Stateand NRC relationship as laid out in the ASME Code.The State Liaison Officer Program, established in 1976, provides a focalpoint in each of the 50 States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico forcommunication between NRC and the States. The Governor-appointed StateLiaison Officer is intended to be the principal person in the State tokeep the Governor informed of nuclear regulatory matters of interest tothe Governor, to keep other State officials informed of these matters,and to respond to NRC inquiries.Other areas in which NRC and States have worked together include environmentalmonitoring around the premises of nuclear power plant facilities and participationin the Conference of Radiation Control Program Directors, Inc., which addressesradiological health in areas such as diagnostic and therapeutic X-rays,radioactive materials, and other related activities.Under subsection 274i of the Act, the Commission is authorized, in carryingout its licensing and regulatory responsibilities, to enter into a Memorandumof Understanding (MOU) with any State to perform inspections or other functionson a cooperative basis as the NRC deems appropriate. According to the legislativehistory of section 274, subsection 274i clarifies the Commission's existingauthority under subsection 161f which enables the NRC to obtain the servicesof State personnel to perform functions on its behalf as may be desirable.NRC has entered into MOUs with several States under subsection 274i ofthe Act. MOUs have helped to facilitate environmental review during constructionof nuclear power plants. At one point, there was a perceived need to broadenthe basis for formal cooperative instruments with States under subsection274i beyond that of water quality MOUs. As a result, general or ``umbrella''MOUs were negotiated, with subagreements on specific issues such as low-levelwaste package and transport inspections. Two unique agreements were negotiatedwith Oregon; one concerning the sharing of proprietary information regardingthe Trojan facility and the other covering coordination of the State andNRC resident inspector programs at Trojan. Additionally, the NRC has documentedthe protocol that States must follow to be permitted to observe certainNRC activities in ``letter agreements.''In recent years, States have taken the initiative to monitor more closelycommercial nuclear power plants and other nuclear production or utilizationfacilities within, and adjacent to, their State boundaries by becomingbetter informed and, in some cases, more involved in activities relatedto the regulation and operation of those facilities. It was this increasedinterest by States to become more actively involved in NRC activities thatcaused the NRC to re-examine those agreements previously negotiated withStates and to determine a uniform policy for how future State proposalsshould be handled.In developing this policy statement to be used to respond to future Stateproposals, the Commission, recognizing that the regulatory responsibilitiesassigned exclusively to the NRC by the Act cannot be delegated, has considered:(1) Those activities it deems appropriate for States to conduct on a cooperativebasis and are desirable for State personnel to perform on behalf of theNRC; and (2) its oversight responsibility to ensure that NRC standards,regulations, and procedures are met where State representatives carry outNRC functions. Further, it is the Commission's intention to provide uniformityin its handling of State requests.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Statement of Policy</ITAG>It is the NRC's policy to cooperate fully with State governments as theyseek to respond to the expectations of their citizens that their healthand safety be protected and that there be minimal impact on the environmentas a result of activities licensed by the NRC. The NRC and the States havecomplementary responsibilities in protecting public health and safety andthe environment. Furthermore, the NRC is committed to the full and timelydisclosure of matters affecting the public and to the fair and uniformhandling of all agency interactions with the States, the public, and NRClicensees.Accordingly, the NRC will continue to keep Governor-appointed State LiaisonOfficers routinely informed on matters of interest to the States. The NRCwill respond in a timely manner to a State's requests for information andits recommendations concerning matters within the NRC's regulatory jurisdiction.If requested, the NRC will routinely inform State Liaison Officers of publicmeetings between NRC and its licensees and applicants in order that Staterepresentatives may attend as observers. Additionally, at the State's request,State representatives will be able to observe specific inspections and/orinspection entrance and exit meetings where State representatives are knowledgeablein radiological health and safety matters.The Commission recognizes that the involvement of qualified State representativesin NRC radiological health and safety programs has the potential for providingadditional safety benefit. Therefore, the NRC will consider State proposalsto enter into instruments of cooperation for State participation in inspectionsand inspection entrance and exit meetings. State participation in NRC programswould allow qualified State representatives, either individually or asa member of a team, to conduct specific inspection activities in accordancewith NRC standards, regulations, and procedures in close cooperation withthe NRC. State activities will normally be conducted under the oversightof an authorized NRC representative with the degree of oversight dependentupon the activity involved. In the proposal to enter into an instrumentof cooperation, the State must identify those activities for which cooperationwith the NRC is desired. The State must propose a program that: (1) Recognizesthe Federal Government, primarily NRC, as having the exclusive authorityand responsibility to regulate the radiological and national security aspectsof the construction and operation of nuclear production or utilizationfacilities, except for certain authority over air emissions granted toStates by the Clean Air Act; (2) is in accordance with Federal standardsand regulations; (3) specifies minimum education, experience, training,and qualification requirements for State representatives which are patternedafter those of NRC inspectors; (4) contains provisions for the findingsof State representatives to be transmitted to NRC for disposition; (5)would not impose an undue burden on the NRC and its licensees and applicants;and (6) abides by NRC protocol not to be publicly disclose inspection findingsprior to the release of the NRC inspection report.Consistent with section 274(c) of the Act, the NRC will not consider Stateproposals for instruments of cooperation that do not include the elementslisted above, which are designed to ensure close cooperation and consistencywith the NRC inspection program. As a practical matter, the NRC is concernedthat independent State inspection programs could direct an applicant'sor licensee's attention to areas not consistent with NRC safety priorities,misinterpret NRC safety requirements, or give the perception of dual regulation.For purposes of this policy statement, an independent State inspectionprogram is one in which State representatives would conduct inspectionsand assess NRC-regulated activities on a State's own initiative and authoritywithout close cooperation with, and oversight by, an authorized NRC representative.Instruments of cooperation between the NRC and the States, approved priorto the date of this policy statement will continue to be honored by theNRC. The NRC strongly encourages those States holding these agreementsto consider modifying them, if necessary, to bring them into conformancewith the provisions of this policy statement.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Implementation</ITAG>As provided in the policy statement the NRC will routinely keep State LiaisonOfficers informed on matters of interest to the States. In general, allState requests should come from the State Liaison Officer to the appropriateNRC Regional Office. The NRC will make every effort to respond as fullyas possible to all requests from States for information on matters concerningnuclear production or utilization facility safety within 30 days. The NRCwill work to achieve a timely response to State recommendations relatingto the safe operation of nuclear production or utilization facilities.State representatives are free to attend as observers any public meetingbetween the NRC and its applicants and licensees. The appropriate RegionalOffice will routinely inform State Liaison Officers of the scheduling ofpublic meetings upon request. State requests to observe inspections and/orinspection entrance and exit meetings conducted by the NRC require theapproval of the appropriate Regional Administrator.NRC will consider State participation in inspections and the inspectionentrance and exit meetings, where the State-proposed agreement identifiesthe specific inspections they wish to assist NRC with and provides a programcontaining those elements as described in the policy statement. NRC maydevelop inspection plans along with qualified State representatives usingapplicable procedures in the NRC Inspection Manual. Qualified State representativesmay be permitted to perform inspections in cooperation with, and on behalfof, the NRC under the oversight of an authorized NRC representative. Thedegree of oversight provided would depend on the activity. For instance,State representatives may be accompanied by an NRC representative initially,in order to assess the State inspectors' preparedness to conduct the inspectionindividually. Other activities may be conducted as a team with NRC takingthe lead. All enforcement action will be undertaken by the NRC.The Commission will decide policy matters related to agreements proposedunder this policy statement. Once the Commission has decided the policyon a specific type of agreement, similar State-proposed agreements maybe approved, consistent with Commission policy, by the Executive Directorfor Operations in coordination with the Office of Governmental and PublicAffairs. A State-proposed instrument of cooperation will be documentedin a formal MOU signed by NRC and the State.Once the NRC has decided to enter into an MOU for State involvement inNRC inspections, a formal review, not less than six months after the effectivedate, will be performed by the NRC to evaluate implementation of the MOUand resolve any problems identified. Final agreements will be subject toperiodic reviews and may be amended or modified upon written agreementby both parties and may be terminated upon 30 days written notice by eitherparty.Additionally, once State involvement in NRC activities at a nuclear productionor utilization facility is approved by the NRC, the State is responsiblefor meeting all requirements of an NRC licensee and applicant related topersonal safety and unescorted access for State representatives at thesite.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Rockville, Maryland, this 8th day of June, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Samuel J.
