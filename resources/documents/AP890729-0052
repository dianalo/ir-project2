The tanker involved in the nation's worst oil spill wasscheduled to enter San Diego Bay early Sunday, under tow as it hasbeen throughout the 2,500-mile journey south from Alaska.   Divers were confident they had cut off all the dangling steelplates torn loose during the southerly voyage and that the guttedtanker would be able to pass through the harbor's shallows.   State environment officials said they would keep close watch onthe lumbering ship when it enters the bay under escort, surroundedby a flotilla of U.S. Coast Guard boats.   Local Greenpeace activists said they'd be watching too,following at a distance after staging a protest demonstrationagainst Exxon planned for Sunday morning.   ``We are concerned that it will be discharging into the SanDiego Bay,'' said Rick Nadeau, director of Greenpeace in San Diego.``If it does have some oil slicks coming out of it, we'll be ableto see that.''   Nadeau said Greenpeace wants to see the Valdez reach the docksafely because more environmental damage could occur if the tankerremains at sea any longer.   An 18-mile oil slick was spotted near the tanker July 10, andsince then the Valdez has been halted about 55 miles off the coastof San Diego.   Numerous tests were conducted and the emergency plate-cuttingwork was undertaken. Exxon officials and state negotiators hammeredout an agreement to allow Valdez into port.   The Valdez, which spilled 11 million gallons of crude oil afterslamming into a submerged reef in Alaska, was to execute a seriesof maneuvers, simulating what it will have to do inside the harbor,before being allowed into the bay.   Exxon officials insist that periodic discharges from the Valdezare nontoxic with barely detectable traces of oil. State officials,leery of Exxon assurances, have said the ship is releasingsignificant pollutants.</TEXT></DOC>
