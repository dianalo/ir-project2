(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Oakland Community College has declareda band of masked suspects innocent in the failure of a computersystem.   Raccoons on the Highland Lakes campus initially were accused ofdamaging the system Aug. 31 by entering tunnels and vandalizing acomputer cable.   ``The preliminary diagnosis was that animals chewed through thecable because it had happened before,'' college spokesman GeorgeCartsonis said. ``We knew from the droppings and chew marks theyhad been there.''   But an investigation found that maintenance workers had allowedthe cable to slip against hot-water pipes that melted part of thecable, Cartsonis said.   ``Just because raccoons wear masks doesn't mean they are alwaysthe bad guys,'' he said. ``They got blamed for something theydidn't do.''</TEXT><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thomas Schaffner thinks the solution to voterapathy is to follow the Chicago's maxim, ``Vote early and voteoften.''   To promote his idea _ and sign up subscribers to his newsletterabout Chicago _ he is selling a Campaign '88 button that reads:``Two ballots please ... I'm from Chicago.''   With current and former Chicago residents picking up the slackfrom apathetic voters, turnout could exceed 100 percent on Nov. 8,said Schaffner, publisher of Chicago File, a newsletter for formerWindy City residents.   He devoted the October issue to Chicago's history of unorthodoxget-out-the-vote techniques and its residents' commitment todemocracy.   ``Many carry the `right to vote' all the way to their graves,often unknowingly. Once there, they continue to faithfully castballots for a good many years,'' wrote Schaffner.   On Election Day, Schaffner advised: ``Proclaim yourself precinctcaptain. ... Wear something official-looking and walk around yourneighborhood telling people who they should vote for. Don't forgetto invent some ugly rumors about your candidate's opponent.''   ``Elections are Chicago's Mardi Gras,'' he said.</TEXT><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Margie Boyle retired this week as a flightattendant for Eastern Airlines, never missing a flight in 44 yearson the job.   She began at Eastern in Atlanta on Feb. 14, 1944, thinking ayear or so as a flight attendant would be a good ``finishingschool.''   Her tenure ended with Miss Boyle working 11,000 flights, serving1.2 million meals and flying 22 million miles. She kept heroriginal uniform size.   Her first flights with Eastern were in 21-passenger DC-3s withnon-pressurized cabins, no air conditioning and often no heat. ``Iwould give baldheaded men pillows to put on their heads so theywouldn't get too cold,'' she said.   And then there was the time during her DC-3 days when frogsbound for a research facility escaped and ``kind of produced somefestivity in the cabin.''</TEXT></DOC>
