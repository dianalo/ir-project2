Lou Barbieri, chief of the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration's satellite operations center, said GOES-4 hadreached the end of its useful life and was put into a higher orbitto get it out of the way.   GOES-4 had spent its working life at 22,300 miles above theEarth, the busiest altitude for satellites. At this height,satellites take 24 hours to orbit the Earth and appear to bestationary at one point above the globe.   Over a three-week period, NOAA satellite controllers commandedthe GOES-4 to make six rocket firings that slowly raised the craft'sorbit by 62 miles. Barbieri said the increased altitude will add oneminute per day to the satellite's orbit period and cause it toslowly drift westward.   GOES-4, which cost $45 million and was expected to last only 2 to5 years, was launched in September, 1980. It initially was stationedover the Pacific Ocean and used infrared and visible lightinstruments to capture images of weather patterns and stormformations over the western United States. NOAA said the satellitewarned of the approach of hurricane Iwa which struck Hawaii inNovember, 1982 and caused an estimated $350 million in damage.   In 1984, GOES-4 was loaned to the European Space Agency to serveas a weather data relay station. Barbieri said the craft was movedto a point over the western Atlantic to help the Europeans recoverfrom a satellite failure.   Barbieri said a malfunction of a primary imaging system anddepletion of on board fuel forced NOAA to retire GOES-4. He said theagency sent two earlier satellites to even higher orbits, but GOES-4only had enough fuel to edge up another 62 miles.   Retirement of GOES-4 leaves NOAA with six working satellites, buttwo of these, GOES-2 and GOES-3, are used only as communicationrelays, Barbieri said.</TEXT></DOC>
