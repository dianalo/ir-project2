The petition is based on the groundthat after section 409 food additive regulations were initially adoptedfor these pesticides in the absence of any data showing that the pesticidescaused cancer, EPA determined that they are indeed carcinogens. The subsequentdetermination triggers application of the Delaney Anti-Cancer Amendmentand requires that EPA revoke the existing regulations that permit thesecarcinogens in processed foods.Since the EPA has already determined that these pesticides are animal carcinogens,53 FR 41104, October 19, 1988, there are no diputed facts that are materialto this petition. Therefore, it is unnecessary for the EPA to hold a hearingor any other prolonged proceeding prior to acting on this petition. Instead,the only issue for EPA to decide is whether the Delaney clause requiresthese pesticides to be used in processed foods be revoked.In the October 19, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, EPA announced its view that the Delaneyclause applies prospectively only and is not applicable to currently registeredpesticides. Although EPA claims that this policy is of a longstanding nature,the October 19, 1988 statement is the first normal expression of the policy.This petition is based on a different interpretation of the law than thatadvanced by EPA in the October 19, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice. We contend that the Delaney clause appliesto processed foods regardless of when the carcinogenicity was discovered.If EPA adheres to its view that the Delaney clause does not apply retrospectively,then it should promptly deny the petition. On the other hand, if EPA agreeswith the petitioners that the Delaney clause apples to currently-registeredpesticides that are animal carcinogens, then it should promptly grant thepetition, revoke the relevant regulations, and simultaneously initiatesteps to expeditiously revoke the October 19, 1988<T4> Federal Register</T4> policy statement. In any event, petitionersrequest that EPA act expeditiously.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\In addition to the authorities cited, petitioners are relyingon, and hereby incorporate by reference, the report of the National Academyof Sciences, <T3>Regulating Pesticides in Food, and the Delaney Paradox</T3> (NationalAcademy Press, 1987 (``NAS Report'').PetitionersPetitioner John K. Van de Kamp, Attorney General of the State of California,is the chief law enforcement officer of the State of California and ischarged with the authority to file actions he deems necessary to safeguardthe public interest and people of the State, and specifically, to protectthe environment and natural resources of the State.

Since 1971, Public Citizen and its Health Research Grouphave engaged in research and advocacy to promote safe food and specificallyto prohibit carcinogenic and other hazardous chemicals from entering thefood supply. Public Citizen petitions on behalf of its members.Petitioner American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations(``AFL-CIO'') is a federation of 101 national and international unionswith a total membership of approximately 14.5 million working men and womanthat is headquartered in Washington, DC. Nearly all of the AFL-CIO affiliates'members consume processed foods regulated by EPA. Among the purposes ofthe AFL-CIO is to make the members of its affiliates aware of potentialadverse health and safety risks, including risks resulting from exposureto pesticides and to enable its affiliates to take appropriate steps toprotect those members. AFL-CIO petitions on behalf of its members.Petitioner National Resources Defense Council (NRDC) is a nonprofit, environmentalorganization with over 100,000 members and contributors nationwide. NRDChas a longstanding interest in improving EPA's regulation of pesticidesand other toxic chemicals and in ensuring that pesticide residue levelsin food are restricted in order to protect the public health. NRDC petitionson behalf of its members.Petitioner Kathleen E. Les, the mother of Frances Les Thomas, age one,joins the petitions individually and on behalf of her child. Each is exposedto pesticides daily through pesticides in processed food regulated by defendants.Kathleen E. Les and Frances Les Thomas reside in Sacramento, California,Petitioner Manuel Jesus Perez Morales is a 29-year-old California farmworkerand the father of petitioner David R. Perez, age seven, and Manuel R. Perez,age two. Each regularly consumes processed foods which contain pesticidesregulated by defendants. Because Manuel Jesus Perez Morales lives in anagricultural community, he is additionally exposed to pesticides as a resultof air and water contamination. Also, he is exposed on the job. Most recently,he was employed as a pesticide applicator. In August 1987, he was so severelyexposed to a series of pesticides that he has since been unable to work.FactsIn the October 19, 1988 <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice, EPA identified 66 pesticides for whichit has evidence of carcinogenicity (53 FR 41108 Appendix B). Each of thosepesticides is classified into a group depending on the strength of theevidence of its carcinogenicity. The two groups that are relevant to thispetition are Groups B2 and C. Group B2 identifies pesticides that EPA hasclassified as ``Probable Human Carcinogen[s]'' based at least in part on``sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity from animal studies.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 41118. Group C identifies pesticides that are ``PossibleHuman Carcinogen[s]'' on the basis of ``[l]imited evidence of carcinogenicityin animals in the absence of human data.'' <T3>Id.</T3> EPA has determined that both groups are animal carcinogens,although there is less evidence that the pesticide is a human carcinogenif the pesticide is in Group C than if it is in Group B2.Using EPA's own list petitioners have identified seven pesticides thatfall within Group B2 or Group C and which also have section 409 processedfood tolerances that are greater than their tolerances are identified onthe chart below.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,xs75,xls30,r150,r150</C><H1>Pesticide \2\</H1><H1>Class</H1><H1>Section 408 tolerance (parts per million)</H1><H1>Section 409 tolerance (parts per million)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Benomyl<D>C</D><D>10.0 grapes, 5.0 tomatoes (40 CFR 180.294)</D><D>50 raisins, 50 tomato products, (21 CFR 193.30; 40 CFR 185.350).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Chlordimeform<D>B2</D><D>4.0 plums/fresh prunes (40 CFR 180.285)</D><D>15.0 dried prunes (21 CFR 193.60; 21 CFR 185.170).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dichlorvos (DDVP) <D>B2</D><D>0.1 figs, 0.05 tomatoes (40 CFR 180.235)</D><D>0.5 dried figs, 0.5 nonperishable, bagged, packaged processed food (21CFR 193.140; 40 CFR 185.1900).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dicofol<D>C</D><D>No tolerance for tea</D><D>45 dried tea (40 CFR 185.410).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Mancozeb<D>B2</D><D>7.0 grapes, 5.0 barly grain, 5.0 oat grain, 5.0 rye wheat, 5.0 wheatgrain (40 CFR 180.176)</D><D>28.0 raisins, 20.0 bran of barely oats, rye, wheat (21 CFR 193.460;40 CFR 185.6300).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Phosmet<D>C</D><D>0.1 cottonseed (40 CFR 180.261)</D><D>0.2 cottonseed oil (40 CFR 185.350).</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Trifluralin<D>C</D><D>0.05 spearmint, peppermint hay (40 CFR 180.207)</D><D>2.0 spearmint, peppermint oil (21 CFR 193.400; 40 CFR 185.5900).</D><F>\2\ This petition does not request relief with respect to Alar (daminozide)because it is subject to a separate legal proceeding that is now pending.As the undersigned attorneys for Public Citizen and NRDC have argued ina May 11, 1989 submission supporting the objections of Henry Gluckstern,EPA is legally required to grant the objections to the extension of thetolerance for Alar on apples, which would have the effect of immediatelybanning its use.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Since the time each of these pesticides was placed on the market, EPA hasdetermined on the basis of newly developed evidence that the pesticideinduces cancer in animals, within the meaning of the Delaney clause. Nevertheless,each pesticide has a section 409 tolerance that permits greater residuesin processed foods than are permitted on the raw agricultural product.Therefore, this petition raises no factual issues, and the issue for EPAto resolve is whether the Delaney clause applies in such circumstances.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ If the Agency determines that any of the seven pesticidesdoes not induce cancer within the meaning of the Delaney clause, that determinationshould not delay the resolution of the legal issues raised as to the pesticidesfor which it is undisputed that cancer is induced. In that event, we requestthat EPA act promptly on the petition with respect to the pesticides thatit agrees induce cancer in animals.Discussion<ITAG tagnum="81">1. Applicable Statutory Provisions</ITAG>Pesticides are subject to a number of different statutes, including theFederal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (``FIFRA''), 7 U.S.C.138 <T3>et seq., </T3>the Pesticide Amendment to the Federal Food, Drug andCosmetic Act (``FDC Act''), 21 U.S.C. 346a, and the Food Additives Amendmentto the FDC Act, 21 U.S.C. 348.Before a pesticide is permitted to be sold in the United States, certaintests must be conducted and submitted to EPA for review, including testsfor carcinogenicity. <T3>See </T3>FIFRA, sections 3(c)(1)(B), 3(c)(2)(A), 7 U.S.C. 136a(c)(1)(B),136a(c)(2)(A). Such test data is also used to set residue tolerances undersection 408 of the FDC Act, 21 U.S.C. 346a, and food additive tolerancesfor processed foods under section 409 of the Act, 21 U.S.C. 348.Section 409 applies to all substances that qualify as ``food additives,''within the meaning of section 201(s), 21 U.S.C. 321. If a pesticide usequalifies as a ``food additive,'' then EPA may not approve it unless itis ``safe'' within the meaning of section 409. Under the Delaney clause,EPA may not find any food additive pesticide to be ``safe'' where the pesticide,regardless of the level of risk, is ``found to induce cancer when ingestedby man or animal.'' (Section 409(c)(3)(A), 21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)).Section 201(s) defines ``food additives'' as ``any substance which eitherbecomes a component or otherwise affect[s] the characteristics of food,''unless it is ``a pesticide chemical in or on a <T3>raw </T3>agricultural commodity.'' (21 U.S.C. 321(s)(1) (emphasis added);<T3>see also </T3>section 201(s)(2), 21 U.S.C. 321(s)(2)). Therefore, pesticidesin <T3>processed </T3>foods are subject to the Food Additives Amendment andthe Delaney clause.Section 402(a)(2)(C) provides the legal basis for enforcement actions withrespect to adulterated food sold in violation of the Food Additives Amendment,which is therefore subject to seizure. 21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C); <T3>see also </T3>sections 301-304, 21 U.S.C. 331-334. However, section402(a)(2)(C) also provides ``where a particular chemical has been usedin or on a raw agricultural commodity in conformity with an exemption grantedor a tolerance prescribed under section 408'' and when the product hasbeen processed, then the product shall ``not be deemed unsafe'' if theresidue ``has been removed to the extent possible'' and if the concentrationof the residue ``is not greater than the tolerance prescribed on the rawagricultural commodity.'' (21 U.S.C. 342(a)(2)(C)). Thus, the effect ofall these provisions is that pesticides used in processed foods that mayconcentrate at levels above the section 408 residue allowed in raw productsare illegal unless permitted pursuant to a food additive regulation pursuantto section 409. Such a regulation must comply with the Delaney clause.<ITAG tagnum="81">2. The October 19, 1988 Policy Statement</ITAG>Since Federal regulation of pesticide use first began, scientific standardsfor assessing the risk of their use have become considerably more sophisticatedand accurate. For example, prior to 1963, no tests were required regardinga pesticide's potential cancer-causing properties, and it was not until1978 that EPA adopted final carcinogenicity data requirements. Therefore,when residue tolerances were initially established for many pesticides,no consideration was given to carcinogenicity.Since 1972, however, EPA has been reviewing the safety of all pesticidesregistered prior to that time. During the course of the review, it becameclear that a large number of pesticides are carcinogens and, because theyconcentrate in processed foods, are being sold in violation of the Delaneyclause. Therefore, in February 1985, EPA requested the National Academyof Sciences (NAS) to conduct a study of the likely impact of the Delaneyclause on the regulation of pesticides. The NAS issued its report in May1987 which both discussed the high risk levels of many pesticides usedin foods today and recommended legislative changes in the pesticide laws,including the Delaney clause.Rather than following the NAS's recommendation, in October 1988, EPA issuedits policy statement, unilaterally declaring that the Delaney clause doesnot apply to pesticides found to induce cancer in animals after being registered,but that the Delaney clause applies, if at all, only to newly registeredpesticides.In support of this argument, EPA points out that the Delaney clause iscontained in section 409(c), which is the provision applicable to petitionsto list new food additives (53 FR 41108). EPA claims that section 409(h),which governs the amendment or repeal of existing section 409 regulations,``does not expressly require repeal of food additives regulations whennew data indicate that the pesticide induces cancer.'' (53 FR 41108). Thatcharacterization of the statute is wrong. Section 309(h) requires EPA to issue regulations governing amendment orrepeal of food additive regulations, and it further states that ``suchprocedures shall conform to the procedure provided in this section forthe promulgation of such regulations.'' (21 U.S.C. 348(h)). The ``procedureprovided in this section'' for new food additive regulations is containedin sections 409(b) and 409(c), and the latter contains the Delaney clause(21 U.S.C. 348(c)(3)(A)). Thus, section 409(h) requires EPA to use thesame standard in revoking tolerances that it uses in granting them. Therefore,the language and structure of the statute demonstrate that the Delaneyclause applies to pesticides that are currently on the market. The FDA, which administers section 409 with respect to non-pesticide foodadditives, has consistently interpreted section 409(h) as incorporatingthe Delaney clause and therefore as requiring it to ban food additivesthat were determined to be animal carcinogens <T3>after </T3>they had been sold for a long period of time. Thus, in 1977,it relied on the Delaney clause to support its proposal to ban saccharin,although that decision was ultimately overruled by special congressionallegislation. <T3>See </T3>42 FR 19996, April 15, 1977. Recently, in considering whetherto repeal the section 409 food additive regulation governing the use ofmethylene chloride in decaffeinated coffee, the FDA considered the Delaneyclause to be applicable (50 FR 51551 December 18, 1985). As the United States Court of Claims held in <T3>California Canners andamp; Growers Association </T3>v. <T3>United States, </T3>9 Cl. Ct. 774, 782 (1986), in considering damageclaims based on the FDA's ban of cyclamates, the ``statute contemplatescarcinogenicity known at the time an application for approval is filed,but it is undisputed that the Secretary has a statutory obligation to declareunsafe approved products that are subsequently found to endanger publichealth and safety.'' Although cyclamates had been marketed without a foodadditive petition on the ground that the substance was generally recognizedas safe, the court's statement and the reasoning behind it apply fullyto food additives (including pesticides in processed foods) that have tolerances.Since the Delaney Clause's enactment in 1958, the FDA has interpreted itsproscriptions as equally applicable to new and old food additives whichare found to be carcinogenic. The FDA and its parent agency, the Departmentof Health, Education and Welfare, played a key role in drafting the FoodAdditives Amendment of 1958, and were the sole Federal authority responsiblefor implementing the statute until EPA was created in 1970. Accordingly,its interpretation of the statute is entitled to great weight. <T3>Norwegian Nitrogen Products Co. </T3>v. <T3>U.S., </T3>288 U.S. 294, 315 (1933); <T3>Community Nutrition Institute </T3>v. <T3>Young, </T3>106 S.Ct. 2360 (1986); <T3>Chevron </T3>v. <T3>Natural Resources Defense Council, </T3>467 U.S. 837 (1984). Similarly,in its Report, the National Academy of Sciences concluded that the DelaneyClause is applicable to pesticides that are currently on the market andthat qualify as ``food additives'' under the FDC Act (NAS Report, p. 91).Indeed, the Report identified a number of processed food tolerances, includingthe seven at issue in this petition, which it concluded ``appear to conflictwith the Delaney Clause.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at 5.In <T3>Environmental Defense Fund </T3>v. <T3>EPA, </T3>428 F.2d 1083 (1970), the United States Court of Appealsfor the District of Columbia Circuit considered this issue in evaluatinga petition to amend the tolerances for the pesticide DDT. The provisionat issue there, section 408(m) of the Pesticide Amendments to the FDC Act,21 U.S.C. 346a(m), is analogous to section 409(h) of the Food AdditivesAmendment to the Act, 21 U.S.C. 348(h), the provision at issue here. Accordingto the D.C. Circuit, <ITAG tagnum="21">Once new evidence bearing on the safety of pesticide residues hasbeen adduced or cited sufficient to justify reopening the issue of thevalidity of existing tolerances, as in the present case, the burden ofestablishing the safety of any tolerance remains on those who seek to permita residue. <T3>In this connection we note that the statute itself explicitly requiresthat the procedures for amending or repealing tolerances should be thesame as those for establishing tolerances. </T3>21 U.S.C. 346a(m).</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T3>Id. </T3>at 1092 n.27 (emphasis added). In its use of the term ``procedures,''the Court was referring to the substantive standard, which is applicableboth at the time the initial tolerances is adopted and when it is amendedor repealed.Thus, the foregoing demonstrates that the NAS Report was correct in concludingthat there is ``no convincing legal or scientific basis for the EPA * ** to avoid applying the standards of section 409, including the DelancyClause, to currently registered compound.'' (NAS Report, p. 91).ConclusionFor the foregoing reasons, petitioners urge that the section 409 tolerancesfor Benomyl, Chlordimeform, Dichlorvos (DDVP), Dicofol, Mancozeb, Phosmet,and Trifluralin be repealed. Petitioners also urge that EPA waive any applicablefees since they are acting in the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="21">Respectfully submitted,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John K. Van D.
