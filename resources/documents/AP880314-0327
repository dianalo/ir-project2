Boone Pickens said Mondaythe petroleum industry will recover soon, but never to the heightsreached during its boom days in the early 1980s.   Pickens, chairman of Mesa Limited Parnership of Amarillo, saidoil should reach at least $18 a barrel by the end of the year, farbelow its highs near $40 a barrel in 1982.   Pickens told delegates to the 111th Texas and SouthwesternCattle Raisers convention that the state needs to continue itstrend of economic diversification.   ``Sometime, oil production in Texas won't be too important.Taxes from the oil industry are consistently going down,'' Pickenssaid.   ``To believe that the oil industry is going to lead the state ofthe doldrums we're in I don't believe it will be the case,'' hesaid. ``I do believe the industry will get better over a period oftime, but it will never be the leader that we had been in thepast.''   Pickens said the oil and gas rig count would never reach itspeak of nearly 5,000 in 1981.   ``I don't believe in my lifetime that I will see 2,000 rigsoperating in the United States,'' Pickens said.   Pickens said that consumers should not fear the long lines atthe pumps such as those during the Arab oil embargo of 1973 and1974.   ``OPEC is going to provide the floor price for you. Just givethem a little time and they'll get their act in order and they'llgive you an $18 floor,'' he said.   Pickens said he opposed an oil import fee because it would sparkgovernment control.</TEXT></DOC>
