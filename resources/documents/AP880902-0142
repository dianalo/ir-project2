At least 120,000 people have fled homes in the countryside totake shelter in Dhaka, a relief official said.   ``There was great panic after the rain because for many therewas hardly any place to take cover,'' said the official, AbdurRashid.   At least one-third of the country is flooded and newspapers say758 people have died in house collapses, snake bites and drowningssince June, when the annual southwest monsoon hit the subcontinent.The government says only 280 people have died, but its estimatesare considered low.   More than half of Dhaka came under water after the adjacentBuriganga River burst its banks. By Friday evening the river, atributary of the mighty Ganges, was about three inches above floodlevel, its highest in 34 years.   The government has set up 125 relief camps in the city andordered the closure of all schools and colleges to use thebuildings to house displaced people, Rashid said.   Floodwaters are 6 feet deep at places, and some residents werereported to be hoarding food.   Dhaka's airport remained open for domestic flights, butinternational airlines were advised to suspend operations for 24hours. An airport official said up to 2 inches of water coveredparts of the complex.   The Bengali-language Sangbad newspaper said Friday at least 10more people died in the floods in the northern districts ofMymnesingh and Munshiganj.   The Ganges and the Brahmaputra rivers and their dozens oftributaries flow from India and through Bangladesh to the Bay ofBengal. The rivers flood almost every year after the monsoonshowers in Bangladesh and India.   Flooding began in the northern districts about three weeks ago,but areas to the south were affected recently as the waters swirleddownstream.   International aid for flood victims has arrived in response toan appeal from President Hussain Muhammad Ershad. The United Stateshas pledged $25,000 to help relief efforts and India sent four airforce helicopters to reach flood-affected areas.   Bangladesh is one of the poorest countries in the world and its109 million people earn a per capita income of about $150 per year.   At least 1,500 people died in floods last year. In 1985, morethan 10,000 were killed when cyclones and tidal waves hit low-lyingislands in the Bay of Bengal, about 130 miles south of Dhaka.</TEXT></DOC>
