The dispute arose after Wang, based in Lowell, Mass.,decided in April to greatly raise the operating systemsoftware fees it charges users who purchase used Wangmachines from the independent resellers.</LP><TEXT>   One reseller, TSJ Inc., based in San Diego, claimed in alawsuit that the scheme was an illegal tying arrangementunder federal antitrust law, and that it was driving it andother resellers out of business. The market for the used Wangequipment at issue is estimated at more than $330 million,most of it controlled by Wang.   Yesterday, Judge Charles A. Legge granted a preliminaryinjunction in the TSJ suit requiring Wang to suspend thepricing, pending a trial. &quot;The record demonstrates sufficientevidence of Wang's intent to control prices or impaircompetition,&quot; Judge Legge wrote. He added: &quot;The court isaware that an injunction interferes with Wang's pricestructure nationally and may have consequences in themarketplace which the court cannot anticipate. It istherefore important to bring this matter to trial quickly.&quot;   The ability of companies in the computer, medicaltechnology and telecommunications businesses to controlafter-market pricing of their products has been of majorinterest recently, both operationally and legally, because ofthe huge costs involved in shifting systems. A related issueis being decided before the U.S. Supreme Court this term.   The Wang decision &quot;is a major decision in that battle,&quot;said Ronald S. Katz, a Coudert Bros. lawyer in San Franciscorepresenting TSJ. &quot;I believe this is material for {Wang's}financial statements.&quot;   &quot;This policy has not only stopped TSJ dead in the water,but it has also stifled all of the other resellers of usedWang equipment,&quot; Scott Somit, the president of TSJ, said in astatement.   Wang couldn't be reached for comment. Lawyers for Wang inSan Francisco also couldn't be reached. In court documents,Wang argued that the pricing structure was a reasonableattempt to eliminate &quot;free-riders&quot; who use its operatingsystem software, that there wasn't any wrongful tyingarrangement because the company doesn't condition access toits software to purchase of hardware from it, and that directpurchasers of its equipment were paying essentially the sameprices as those buying from the independent resellers.</TEXT></DOC>
