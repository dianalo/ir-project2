The promotions, announced this week, are expected toheighten an already intense competition between AmericanExpress and the credit-card companies over the preciousmarket share for consumer charge volume.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Their timing is perfect,&quot; said Kurt Peters, editor ofCredit Card News, a Chicago-based newsletter for theindustry. &quot;It couldn't have been any better. Both Visa andMasterCard are seeing opportunities to lock in some newtransaction growth.&quot;   Indeed, the announcement of the promotions come less thana week after several catalog companies complained of the feeAmerican Express charges the firms whenever a customer makesa purchase. Citing the slowdown in sales and the need topinch pennies, the catalog retailers are seeking reductionsin the so-called discount rate levied by American Express,which is on average about a percentage point higher than Visaor MasterCard. The complaints followed a similiar revolt inBoston, where dozens of restaurant owners threatened to dropaccepting American Express if the fee wasn't lowered.   Although both Visa and MasterCard, whose issuers arerepresented by Visa International and MasterCardInternational Inc., denied the promotions were in response tothe flap over American Express fees, the announcement alsocoincided with the annual meeting of direct marketers inChicago this week, where the &quot;hot&quot; topic has been theAmerican Express discount rate.   For its part, American Express said it is expandingmarketing support for catalog retailers by providing moresophisticated customer analysis. The company said it is alsoincreasing exposure of selected catalog companies in itsmonthly newsletter.   Visa, the largest credit-card concern in the U.S., saidits promotion, slated to begin in August, will provideconsumers with certificates worth as much as 20% off selectedmerchandise purchased from nearly 40 participating catalogcompanies, including Sharper Image, Bloomingdale's by Mailand Lane Bryant.   The certificates would be issued to Visa card-holders whoorder any of the 40 participating catalogs from a list mailedto them by the issuing bank. The card-holder must use thecertificate by June 1992. Visa said the promotion wasdesigned to stimulate catalog purchases during the peakholiday shopping season.   No. 2 MasterCard is taking a different tack. Under itspromotion, &quot;Forest for Our Future,&quot; MasterCard will have atree planted for each coupon sent in by a mail-ordercustomer.</TEXT></DOC>
