In a 6-3 vote, the justices upheld a California law that requires unpaid leave and reinstatement for pregnancy, although state law requires neither for other forms of disability.    The case has been watched closely by business groups looking to see if the court would impose new obligations on employers, and by women's rights organizations, some favoring the law and others viewing it as too paternalistic.    Massachusetts, Connecticut and Montana have similar laws, and in another five states there are employment regulations that have the same purpose. The high court said the intent of such laws is to make women equal in the workplace rather than to give them favored treatment over men. As a result, these laws don't run afoul of federal civil-rights law, which prohibits employment discrimination.    &quot;California's pregnancy disability leave statute allows women, as well as men, to have families without losing their jobs,&quot; the court said in an opinion written by Justice Thurgood Marshall.    The high court said the California law doesn't &quot;compel . . . employers to treat pregnant workers better than other disabled employees; it merely establishes benefits that employers must, at a minimum, provide to pregnant workers.&quot; Employers are free to extend comparable benefits to men, the court said.    The decision, rejecting a challenge to the law by California Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, a CalFed Inc. unit, may have more symbolic importance than practical effect.    &quot;It will stimulate interest&quot; in other states, said Victor Schachter, a San Francisco management attorney, &quot;but won't necessarily result in any added protection in those states that don't have legislation along these lines.&quot; For employers, he said, &quot;it will heighten their interest in addressing the issue, but if not required by state laws, those companies will abide by federal law.&quot;    The dilemma for women's groups was that laws and court rulings treating women as needing special, protective legislation may help women in some circumstances, but may generally undermine their legal status of equality in the work force.    Groups such as the National Organization for Women and the American Civil Liberties Union argued, as did the Reagan administration, that the California law violates the equality that federal civil-rights law requires.    However, the civil-rights groups and the Reagan administration differed in their proposals. The groups favored extending disability leave and reinstatement to all, while the Justice Department proposed simply invalidating the California law as being preempted by federal law. The high court yesterday picked a middle course, ruling that the state law isn't preempted, but declining to require that benefits be extended to other workers.    Susan Ross, a Georgetown University law professor who filed a friend-of-the-court brief for NOW and other groups, said, &quot;We're glad they didn't take the protection away from pregnant workers, but we're disappointed that they didn't give all workers that same protection.&quot;    Women's groups are hoping Congress will pass legislation, sponsored by Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D., Colo.), to provide men and women with as many as 18 weeks of unpaid &quot;parental leave&quot; and as many as 26 weeks of disability leave, both with guaranteed reinstatement. A similar bill wasn't acted upon in the last Congress.    The high court's six-member majority yesterday included four justices who joined most of Justice Marshall's opinion, and Justice Antonin Scalia, who agreed that the California law is valid but for somewhat different reasons. A dissent by Justice Byron White was joined by Chief Justice William Rehnquist and Justice Lewis Powell.    New York Liquor Prices   The justices ruled 7-2 that New York state's system of liquor pricing is inconsistent with federal antitrust law because it permits wholesale companies in effect to fix the prices for retail sales. The court said that the 21st Amendment, which repealed Prohibition and gave the states regulatory authority over liquor sales, didn't insulate state liquor-pricing laws from challenges under federal antitrust law.    In an opinion written by Justice Powell, the high court ruled in favor of a New York City retailer, which was penalized for selling at lower prices than the law permitted, and the Justice Department, which attacked the New York liquor-pricing system in a friend-of-the-court brief.    The law was aimed at protecting small retail liquor stores from competition against larger discount stores. The law requires retailers to sell at 12% above the bottle prices that wholesalers must file with state officials. But wholesalers may sell to retail stores at less than the filed prices, resulting in retail prices that are often much more than 12% above the actual wholesale rate.    Justice Sandra O'Connor dissented, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist.    Criminal Ruling   The high court ruled 6-3 that its decision last year that prosecutors can't disqualify potential jurors solely because of their race applies retroactively to other pending cases.    New rules in criminal cases must be applied retroactively to pending cases, the court said in an opinion written by Justice Harry Blackmun, even when those rules are a &quot;clear break&quot; with past decisions.    The justices ruled in appeals from the Kentucky state courts and Oklahoma federal courts. There was no estimate of how many other people convicted of crimes may be affected by the ruling.    Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justices White and O'Connor dissented. </TEXT></DOC>
