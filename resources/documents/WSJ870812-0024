At a public board meeting in Washington, officials of the deposit insurance fund will disclose the first-half gain, much better than some banking officials had expected, an FDIC official said. In the full year 1986 the fund had a modest gain of $297 million; in the full year 1985, it had a $1.4 billion gain. The FDIC's funds currently total $18.4 billion.    The outlook for the remainder of the year, however, remains clouded by the continuing high number of bank failures -- expected to reach about 200 this year -- and the likely FDIC rescue of First City Bancorp. of Texas, the ailing Houston banking concern.    As previously reported, a federal rescue of First City is in the works and could require $1 billion or more of FDIC funds. Whether the FDIC fund shrinks for the first time in its history largely &quot;depends on First City,&quot; the official said.    As previously reported, FDIC chairman L. William Seidman has said that the deposit insurance fund could show a moderate decline this year.    (Revised WSJ Aug. 13, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
