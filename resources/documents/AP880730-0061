Iraq said it withdrew fromoccupied areas.   The Iraqis seized the western Iranian areas in a week offighting that followed Iran's announcement July 18 that it wouldaccept a cease-fire in the eight-year war.   In reports monitored in Nicosia, Iran said Iraqi forceschemically bombed a village just inside the border near the town ofMarivan in northwestern Iran. It reported Iraqi shelling ofvillages near Sardasht in the same region.   Iran's official Islamic Republic News Agency said 10 civilianswere wounded when chemical bombs were dropped on the village ofBilo.   The agency said Iraqi conventional shells wounded 40 civiliansand damaged several houses in 10 villages around Sardasht in themountainous northwest.   Iraq denied shelling Sardasht and made no comment on thechemical bomb report.   In its daily military communique in Baghdad, Iraq on Saturdayreported massive air strikes against Iranian positions all alongthe warfront.   The communique said Iraqi jetfighters carried out 125 combatmissions and its helicopter gunships flew 89 sorties, inflicting``considerable losses on the enemy in men, equipment and weapons.''   Iran said its forces liberated the towns of Karand, Amirabad,Qasr-e Shirin and Sar-e Pol-e Zahab in the central front, pushingIraqi troops back to the border.   But a military spokesman, quoted by the official Iraqi NewsAgency, said Iraqi forces had pulled out of the towns it occupiedin the central front. The spokesman said Iraqi forces had pulledout of Qasr-e Shirin, Sumar and Amirabad.   Tehran radio, also monitored in Cyprus, said Iraqi forceslaunched an attack a little farther south, around the town ofMehran on the south-central war front. It said they were pushedback.   ``A heavy battle is raging in the area and our Moslem combatantshave forced the Iraqis to retreat,'' the radio said.   On Friday, Hashemi Rafsanjani, Iran's acting commander in chief,said Iraqi forces and Iranian rebels advanced 65 miles into Iranbefore Iran pushed them back toward the border.   Speaking at a prayer service broadcast Friday on Tehran radio,Rafsanjani said Iraqi-backed Iranian rebels had entered a hospitalin the western town of Eslamabad and ``rained bullets on some 30patients,'' killing all of them.   Iran said it drove the rebel fighters out of Eslamabad andKarand, 60 miles inside Iran, killing or wounding 4,500 invaders ina ``heavy battle'' against ``forces of the Baghdad regime and theirhypocritical mercenaries.''   Iranian news reports, monitored in Nicosia, said more than 1,000Iraqi tanks and personnel carriers were either destroyed or seizedin the fighting. ``The operation destroyed the Islamic republic'scancer, which ... could have caused problems for Iranians,''Rafsanjani told the prayer congregation in Tehran in an apparentreference to the rebels.   The rebel group, in a communique released in Baghdad, said itsfighters returned to their bases Friday after killing or wounding40,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards in three days of fighting.   No independent observers were allowed near the fighting andclaims from both sides could not be verified.</TEXT></DOC>
