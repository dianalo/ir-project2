The effects of ion-electron and ion-ion collisions on thegrowth rate of the Weibel-type electromagnetic instability is considered.The results show that electromagnetic instability can be excited in anion-beam-plasma system. Ion-electron collisions increase the growth rateof the instability.</TEXT></DOC>
