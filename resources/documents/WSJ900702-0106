Today, some of the country's best minds think the U.S.needs a new, similar spur to action -- but this time on theeconomic front. For too long, they contend, the U.S. hasignored critical problems that quietly threaten to undercutits position as a world economic power. Now, some of themsay, the challenge from Japan may prove the Sputnik of the1990s. &quot;It's a kind of slow-motion Sputnik,&quot; says JamesPowell, president of Reed College in Oregon. &quot;It's therebeeping at you every time you turn on your VCR or load yourcamera or turn on your fax machine.&quot;   Already, a new wave of economic nationalism is spreadingacross the U.S. It can be heard among the Nobel-prize winningscientists at MIT and the cattle ranchers of Nebraska.Americans worry that they are now locked into some inevitableprocess of decline -- much like the economic downdraft thathas pulled at Britain for years.   &quot;You have to ask yourselves the same questions Brits askedin the '60s,&quot; says Alan Bell, a British analyst at BaringSecurities in Tokyo. &quot;As a Brit, you would get up in themorning and brush your teeth with Colgate and use Palmolivesoap. You would drive a Ford to work for IBM and have Marsbars for your snack during the day.&quot; Substitute Sony Walkmen,Sanyo television sets and Toyota cars, and the story assumesa disturbing relevance for the U.S.   But as it demonstrated in the post-Sputnik era, the U.S.has a unique talent for self-renewal. If harnessed by skilledpolitical leaders, the Japanese challenge could be used toarouse a new sense of national purpose. Public opinion expertDaniel Yankelovich even believes that a presidentialcandidate with a clear analysis could make Japan andcompetitiveness &quot;the No. 1 issue in the 1992 campaign.&quot;   What is to be done? What choices should business andpolitical leaders make?   Not since World War II have the experts been so bitterlydivided. Some see Japan as an economic juggernaut, a &quot;threat&quot;to be &quot;contained.&quot; Others consider Japan as America's closestally and welcome the two countries' growing interdependence.   Yet, amid the growing rancor, some common concerns aboutU.S.-Japan relations have emerged. Japan is indeed a friendand ally, but it also represents a challenge and perhaps evena threat to the economic future of the U.S., given currentweaknesses in the American economy. Relations between the twonations must remain close; but they will also be increasinglytroubled unless strong actions are taken on both sides of thePacific.   Last week, the two nations reached an agreement aimed atharmonizing their economic relationship. But, according tothe scores of interviews conducted for this series ofarticles, much more will have to be done. Here are some ofthe broad themes that promise to be at the core of futuredebate.                                                                                                          Economic nationalism can be a powerful tool to bring aboutlong-needed changes in the U.S.                                                                                                          Many academics and some politicians deplore risingeconomic nationalism, arguing that the world has become aglobal village in which boundaries are less relevant. Butpowerful feelings of American nationalism aren't about to goaway. If tapped, they can provide a source of the kind ofenergy experts think is needed to match the Japanese economicchallenge.   &quot;If we decided, doggone it, we are sick to death of peoplethinking the U.S. is in decline -- we could eat anybody'slunch,&quot; says William Brock, a former labor secretary and U.S.trade representative.   There are dangers here, of course. If misused, economicnationalism can lapse into ugly, even racist demagoguery inwhich Japan becomes the &quot;enemy.&quot; It can lead to &quot;solutions&quot;that could in fact hurt both countries, such as measures toblock Japanese imports or restrict foreign investment. Arecent Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll revealed thispotentially destructive side of economic nationalism.Eighty-six percent of those polled said they would ratherhave a policy of slower growth in both countries than apolicy of faster growth in both countries if that meantallowing Japan to take the lead.   The challenge for American political leaders is to harnesseconomic nationalism and channel it, so it can be used tomake the U.S. stronger, not Japan weaker.                                                                                                          The U.S. must save more and Japan less.                                                                                                          The Japanese have more savings than they can productivelyuse in their own economy. Encouraged by government policies,families set aside as much as 17% of their annual householdincome. As a result, living standards in the country aredepressed and Japanese business has a wealth of money toborrow and invest abroad. A lower savings rate in Japan couldspur living conditions there and potentially reduceresentment abroad, where many economies are awash in Japaneseinvestment.   Savings in the U.S. are another matter. For years,Americans have been comparatively profligate, more inclinedto charge it than save it. Last year, Americans saved lessthan 6% of their household income.   As long as U.S. savings are low, investment from abroad --notably Japan -- provides critical nourishment to the U.S.economy, and any attempt to block it could cause substantialdamage. Nevertheless, America's dependence on foreign capitalis a potential problem for several reasons.   First, anything from an earthquake in Tokyo to Japanesedissatisfaction with U.S. policies could suddenly stop thatflow of cash, sending U.S. interest rates higher and possiblytouching off a recession. Second, the flow of interest,dividends and profit earned by Japanese capital in the U.S.is a drain on the living standards of future Americans. Manypeople also worry that the one-way money flow will subtlyundermine the independence of the U.S.   &quot;I come from a small country -- Canada -- that's used toforeign control,&quot; says Kenneth Courtis of DB Capital Markets.&quot;Foreign control basically means key strategic decisions aremade outside of your economy. The Belgians have learned tolive with that. I don't think you can live with it if you area superpower.&quot;   Natural demographic trends will help correct the savingsimbalance in the future. American baby-boomers are only nowreaching their peak savings years, and the savings rate hasslowly started to rise. In addition, President Bush hasproposed a number of tax-related measures he says willbolster savings, such as a tax-favored &quot;family savingsaccount.&quot; In the meantime, a huge wave of Japanese will soonreach retirement and begin to draw down their life savings.   But economic studies suggest tax incentives provide onlymodest encouragement to save, and the demographic trends bythemselves won't correct the remaining imbalance. For theU.S., that leaves one way to raise the amount of savingsavailable for private investment: cut the federal budgetdeficit, which is causing the government to borrow nearlyhalf the nation's paltry supply of savings.                                                                                                          The U.S. should encourage Japanese companies to act morelike other multinationals.                                                                                                          Even if the savings imbalance were corrected, Japan'smultinational companies would continue spreading across theglobe, just as U.S. companies did in the 1950s and 1960s. Butunlike U.S. and European multinationals, Japanese companiesoften don't hire locals for top management spots in theiroverseas operations, nor do they give local suppliers thesame opportunities they accord suppliers back home.   Until they do, Americans will rightfully view Japaneseinvestment as a mixed blessing. Moreover, business expertssay Japanese companies must dispel the notion that they areagents of Japanese national policy -- that they are, forinstance, trying to keep the best jobs at home.   John Stern, the American Electronics Association's vicepresident in Tokyo, notes that European countries have usedhard-edged local-content legislation to &quot;force Japanesecompanies to behave like Europeans -- buy things on the localmarket and promote local people.&quot; Yet that sort of effort canbe self-defeating, scaring away foreign investment andpromoting inefficiency. Still, the U.S. needs to find someway to keep the pressure on Japanese business to conform toworld standards.                                                                                                          The U.S. must renew its commitment to manufacturing.                                                                                                          The U.S. is lagging in its ability to get science out ofthe laboratories and onto the factory floor. To compete withJapan, new efforts must be made to to turn technologicalbreakthroughs into products.   For the most part, that's a task for the private sector.American companies have spent much of the 1980s in a whirl offinancial restructuring. Many corporate consultants believethat, in the 1990s, executives will spend more time on theshop floor and less with their investment bankers.   There are signs this is already happening. Spurred bycompetition from Japan, U.S. manufacturing productivity hasimproved substantially in recent years. And many companiesare paying new attention to the fundamentals of theirbusiness. One group of American companies has helped MIT setup a new program called Leaders in Manufacturing. It unitestwo divergent academic disciplines -- engineering andbusiness -- and is working with 11 major U.S. corporations totrain a corps of future corporate executives.   &quot;What we've got to do,&quot; explains Bill Hansen, vicepresident for manufacturing at Digital Equipment Corp., &quot;isget our fair share of the best and the brightest going intomanufacturing corporations and the disciplines ofmanufacturing.&quot;                                                                                                          The U.S. education system is in need of an overhaul.                                                                                                          From the vantage point of his campus, Mr. Powell of ReedCollege is worried. The average Japanese high school seniorscores as well as the top 5% of American high school seniorsin math and science, he says. &quot;If we don't fix this problem,there is simply no way we can be a first-class power in the21st century.&quot;   Mr. Powell believes the problem may be partly cultural.&quot;America has never valued education as much as we should,&quot; hesays. &quot;We pay teachers little and we ask schools to doeverything -- be babysitters, provide vocational training,provide counseling. Our leaders ought to get out of the tanksand flag factories and into the schools.&quot;                                                                                                          The U.S. must encourage Japan to make investment in thatcountry easier -- and American companies must work harder tocompete on Japan's turf.                                                                                                          These days, Japan is the most demanding market for manyproducts. To reach world-class status American companies mustbe able to compete there.   Unfortunately, the easiest way to enter most foreignmarkets -- acquiring a local company -- isn't easy in Japan.Takeovers, by custom, are rare. And the stock of Japanesecompanies is largely owned by other companies, creating aninterlocking network of business interests difficult forforeign firms to penetrate. Changing that system won't beeasy. But the U.S. must encourage Japanese businesses andgovernment to find ways to allow foreign companies to getinto Japan's markets.   In addition, American companies, on their own, must workharder toward that goal. Companies with quality products andaggressive marketing have proven it can be done.   Motorola Inc., the Chicago-based maker of electronicproducts, is an example. In the last 12 months alone, it hasrecruited 150 Japanese employees, mostly engineers, bycultivating college professors and handing out 500,000&quot;Motorola&quot; textbook covers in college bookstores. It hasannounced plans to open a second semiconductor factory inJapan and it has sponsored twelve Chicago Symphony Orchestraconcerts throughout the country.   &quot;You have to use every tool in the book,&quot; says GeorgeFisher, Motorola's president and chief executive.   In addition, in an effort to relearn the art of makingmemory chips, a field the company had abandoned, Motorola hasentered into a cross-licensing agreement with Toshiba Inc.&quot;We're participating in the exporting of manufacturingknow-how back to the U.S.,&quot; says Rick Younts, president ofNippon Motorola Ltd.                                                                                                          The U.S. government, too, should learn from Japan.                                                                                                          Some people in the Bush administration virtually recoil atthe phrase &quot;industrial policy.&quot; A powerful White House trio-- Chief of Staff John Sununu, Budget Director Richard Darmanand Economic Adviser Michael Boskin -- have worked to boostfunding in basic research, but have quashed any effort topromote any specific industry. Their fear is that governmentefforts to encourage promising technologies could degenerateinto subsidies for companies with political clout.   But in fact, the government already has an industrialpolicy -- a hodgepodge of subsidies and tax breaks that haveprovided an enormous boost to such industries as aerospace,medical care and housing. What's needed now is for thegovernment to help American industry address a criticalbusiness problem: making the leap from basic research tocommercial products. The U.S. needs to find new ways toencourage investment in products for the future, even if thatinvestment doesn't produce short-term profits for companies.                                                                                                          Americans must learn more about Japan as a country andculture.                                                                                                          Michael Armacost, the U.S. ambassador in Tokyo, notes thatJapan sends 25,000 students a year to the U.S., while theU.S. sends only 1,000 to Japan. Chalmers Johnson, a Japanspecialist at the University of California, contends: &quot;Weneed infinitely more people who can read Japanese.&quot;   Thomas Rohlen, who heads up the Stanford Japan Center inKyoto, is helping Americans learn about Japan. His program,which educates American engineers, businessmen and others, isrun out of a gleaming building with its own Zen rock garden.He recently scored a small victory when two of his charges,both undergraduates, used Japanese to secure a small contractto export American products to Japan.   The Japan Science and Technology Program at MIT is alsohelping change the trend. It sent 43 post-graduate engineersand scientists to Japan last year for stints in Japaneselaboratories. &quot;We're putting Japan into the bloodstream ofthe best and brightest career scientists,&quot; says RichardSamuels, the program's director.                                                                                                          The U.S. must forge a new partnership with Japan inforeign policy.                                                                                                          Secretary of State James Baker calls it a new &quot;globalpartnership&quot; with Japan. But so far, the &quot;partnership&quot;strikes many Japanese as one-sided. They see the U.S.devising its own policies, then asking Japan to pay for them.One example: when the U.S. developed a Third World debt planand then asked the Japanese to cough up several billiondollars to help foot the bill. Given their growing power andnational pride, the Japanese aren't likely to accept such anarrangement for long.   &quot;Adjustments are needed on both sides,&quot; says TakakazuKuriyama, Japan's vice minister of foreign affairs. &quot;The U.S.has to adjust itself to a new position in the world where youare no longer the dominant power, but still the leading poweramong industrial democracies. And Japan has to learn toadjust itself to a new status as a major industrializednation.&quot;   Thirty years ago this summer, the U.S. and Japan revisedthe security treaty that has been the linchpin of theirrelationship ever since. The revision was meant to put thetwo on a more equal footing, but in the world of 1960 therewas no question that the U.S. was overwhelmingly the world'seconomic power.   Today the two countries are on a more nearly equaleconomic footing. No matter how successfully the U.S. dealswith its economic problems, it is unlikely to regain theposition it held for much of the 45 years since World War II.At the same time, the superpower tensions that helped shapethe U.S.-Japan partnership are easing.   The world order will have to change to reflect these newrealities. What will that world order look like?   Over dinner at a French restaurant in Tokyo, Takashi andKuniko Inoguchi hold forth on that question. The marriedcouple are among Japan's political science elite. He is 46years old and a political scientist at Tokyo University; sheis 37, a professor at Sophia University and a populartelevision commentator. He has his doctorate from MIT, shefrom Yale, and both belong to Japan's small but growing groupof internationalists.   They foresee four possible paths for the U.S. and Japan.   The first is a revival of American dominance, &quot;PaxAmericana,&quot; which they consider unlikely. The second theycall &quot;Pax Nipponica,&quot; which would have Japan becoming theleader of the free world. That's equally unlikely, concludesMrs. Inoguchi. &quot;What makes a hegemonic power? You have tohave legitimacy,&quot; she says. &quot;On this point Japan is veryweak. We have the debt of history.&quot;   The third option they call &quot;bigemony&quot; -- the U.S. andJapan sharing power. But that, too, has problems. &quot;Itwouldn't be acceptable to Europe or Asia,&quot; says Mrs.Inoguchi.   That leaves the fourth option -- Pax Consortia, a world nolonger run by a dominant power, but by a coalition of leadingpowers. &quot;It is very difficult to manage,&quot; says Mr. Inoguchi,shaking his head.   But his wife is unequivocal: &quot;It's the only possiblealternative.&quot;   The world of the future will require the cooperation of anumber of major economic powers. The U.S. and Japan, as thetwo largest single economies in that coalition, will hold thekey to its success.   ---            Strains in the U.S.-Japan Relationship...
