(marketing).andO;Ticker:    AMD; INTC.andO;Product:   Intel 80286 (Microprocessor) (marketing)Intel 80386SX (Microprocessor) (marketing).andO;Topic:     Semiconductor IndustryMicroprocessorsMarketing StrategyComparison.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Amid the spate of announcements from intel and Harris (see separate stories),executives from Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) have claimed that the 80286processor runs 16-bit software and as some well-estab- fished benchmarks atleast as fast as the 80386.andM;AMD also claim that the 80286 chip will be cheaper than any 386 processor -including the 386SX - for the foreseeable future.andM;Intel UK has not denied any of these claims, but says that they are notimportant.andP;  According to intel UK technical marketing manager, lan Wilson,&quot;The key factor in this debate is not the performance, but your upgrade pathto the future.andM;When you buy your PC the unit price of the processor doesn't have that muchimpact.andP;  The SX does cost more, but the margin is minimal when you look atthe total system cost.andP;  &quot;andM;AMD has manufacturing rights to the 80286 processor, but not to the 386, andhas long sought to emphasize the user benefits of sticking with the earlierprocessor.andM;Last autumn's Comdex Show saw a press extravaganza based on a Mark Twaintheme, boasting that &quot;Reports of [the 80286's] death have been greatlyexaggerated.andP;  &quot;andM;At a briefing in London on the day following Intel's 386 and 486announcements, AMD demonstrated a series of benchmarks on two Everex PCswhich the company claimed were identical except for their central processors- one being a 386SX, and the other a 286.The two 16MHz zero wait statemachines were tested with Dhrystone 1.1, Norton SI, PC Magazine, LanmarkSpeed, Powermeter, Candamp;T MIPS, and a large spreadsheet recalculation usingLotus 1-2-3,andM;The Ks were also tested under 0S/2 using RBase, Paradox 0S/2, andDisplayWrite IV.andP;  In all cases the 286 machine equaled or surpassed the 386SXmachine.andM;According to AMD's Burchers, &quot;When we show these results to systemmanufacturers, Compaq for example, they always say that they face pressurefrom end users to supply 386 instead of 286 devices.&quot;andM;Later on he added that manufacturers could also make bigger profitandM;margins     on     these      upmarketandM;machines.andM;AMD blame the discrepancy in performance on the 386 being configured to run32-bit software - of which there is very little, he said.andP;  of the 80286's 19016-bit instructions, AMD claims 74 run in fewer clock cycles on the 286 thanon the 386, 66 run in equal clock cycles, and only 50 are faster on the 386.andM;According to Glen Burchers, AMD's 286 marketing manager, &quot;Intel wereoptimizing for 32-bit per- formance at the expense of 16-bit performance.andM;The way to reduce the number of cycles an instruction takes is to add moresilicon, but the trade-off is cost.andM;Wilson also claimed that the Sx was notably faster when running floatingpoint operations because of the speed of the 387SX co-processor.andM;AMD conceded that there win always be a market for the 386 processor amongpower users, but pointed out that 386 machines, withandM;their   32-bit     tracks    on      theandM;motherboard, will also be more expensive.andM;However, the chief competitor to the 286 is the Intel 386SX, which runs32-bit software but - with 16-bit data tracks - doesn't require an expensivemotherboard.andM;Since equal specification 286 and 386SX machines will show little differencein price, and will differ in performance only as their clock speeds differ,the AMD marketing offensive is thought to be increasing the pressure on Intelto launch the 20MHz version of its 386SX pro- cessor.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
