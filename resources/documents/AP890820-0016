DOYLE</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A person you've never met, touting a companyyou've never heard of tries to sell you a stock you never wanted.   Sometimes it's an honest broker pushing a low-priced buthigh-risk legitimate stock. But often the call is from a``boiler-room'' bank of telephones staffed by smooth-talking salespeople preying on the anxieties or greed of unsophisticated buyers.   ``A high pressure salesman might say if you don't buy now, you'regoing to miss the boat,'' says Robert Ferri of the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers. ``The only boat you're going tomiss is the Titanic.''   The NASD oversees over-the-counter stocks and brokers who deal inthem.   A rising tide of fraud involving penny stocks _ inexpensive butrisky securities that usually aren't traded on any stock exchanges _is worrying securities regulators and industry officials across thecountry.   Penny stocks in themselves aren't illegal. But the North AmericanSecurities Administrators Association, a Washington-basedorganization of state investment regulators, calls the fraudulentsale of these securities the biggest threat facing the averageinvestor.   Three weeks ago, 14 people and two companies were charged inChicago with an alleged $10 million penny stock scam in which thecompanies' share prices were artificially raised before being soldat large profits.   The Securities and Exchange Commission alleged in a civilcomplaint that the companies were only shams created to peddlestock. One company's stock, first offered at 15 cents per share in1985, rose to a high of $6 per share through announcements of bogusmergers and other scams that drew in millions of dollars frominvestors around the country.   In Florida earlier this year, state authorities moved to revokethe license of a Denver-based penny stock brokerage after itallegedly bilked thousands of investors, including an 80-year-oldwoman who lost about $30,000.   Penny stock fraud is ``the fraud du jour,'' says Lawrence H.Fuchs, Florida's deputy comptroller.   ``A disproportionate number of customer complaints aboutbroker-dealers in our state derive from the penny stock market,''said John B. Hiatt, director of the New Mexico Securities Division.   ``I would say it's rapidly coming to the forefront of ouractivities,'' said Irwin Fisk, chief investigator for the CaliforniaDivision of Corporations in Southern California.   In the 23 years he's been on the job, Fisk said his division hadseen about six penny stock fraud cases. ``We've got that many ormore pending right now, most in the last few months.''   Officials say the very nature of penny stocks makes them prone toscam artists.   Trading for a few cents up to a few dollars, penny stocks usuallyare issued by new companies ranging from energy developers to makersof would-be wonder drugs. They often have an untested or unevenearnings history.   Because most penny stocks are not listed nationally, informationabout them is hard to obtain and fraudulent claims are difficult todispute.   ``Information is power and you don't have it with penny stocks,''said Ferri, the NASD spokesman.   He said unscrupulous brokers offering stocks in unsolicitedtelephone calls known as ``cold calling'' might be pushinglegitimate stocks but not for the price at which they are actuallytrading. The stocks aren't usually carried in newspaper stocklistings and buyers have no way of knowing their real price.   Another scam consists of constantly selling stock, buying it backand selling it again at increasingly higher prices, like a pyramidscheme, until the last buyers are left holding stocks that are onlyworth a fraction of the price they paid.   The SEC has created a penny stock task force and recently itapproved a rule that will make it impossible for unscrupulousbrokers to conduct penny stock sales with new customers over thephone.   The new rule, effective Jan. 1, 1990, requires buyers to approvethe first three transactions with a new broker in writing andrequires the broker to determine the buyer's financial status andthe suitability of the stock purchase.   Sarah B. Ackerson, an SEC attorney assigned to the task force,said the agency still is compiling nationwide statistics about pennystock fraud.   But she noted that in the first half of the fiscal year, whichwill end Sept. 30, the SEC received 2,462 complaints about pennystock fraud compared with 1,510 for all of last year.   Regulators and industry officials caution investors to be warywhen considering penny stocks, especially when offered throughunsolicited phone calls.   ``Hang up on them,'' advises Florida's Fuchs. ``Investigate acompany thoroughly before you commit money.''   ``I would ask for a prospectus before I bought anything,'' saidCalifornia's Fisk.</TEXT></DOC>
