But he told a news conference at his bush camp that ``never in 14years of war have we come so close'' to peace.   Angola's official news agency announced Wednesday the governmentreleased 700 rebel prisoners. The dispatch said the prisoners werereleased June 2 and reported the prisoners had renounced the rebelmovement and accepted the government's offer of clemency.   The announcement came on the eve of a meeting of African leadersin Gbadolite, Zaire. The meeting could clear the way for directpeace talks between Angola's Marxist government and the rebelNational Union for the Total Independence of Angola.   Savimbi said his delegation in Zaire was willing to be flexibleabout procedures leading to elections and formation of a nationalunity government.   But, he said, the rebels would reject any amnesty or clemency forthe guerrillas.   ``Our army, 75,000 men in the field, will not accept amnesty,clemency or integration'' into the ruling Popular Movement for theLiberation of Angola, Savimbi said. ``That wording has a politicalcontext that means (the rebel army) is considered criminal. Our armywas not defeated and is not going to be defeated.''   Savimbi said he has agreed to stay out of the negotiations andwill not demand a role in any transitional government. But he saidhe would remain the head of his party. He also wants to participatein free elections he anticipates within two years of a formalcease-fire.   He dismissed reports he might go into exile, saying he wouldremain in Angola after a cease-fire, but not necessarily in hissoutheastern stronghold of Jamba.   Angola's government has rejected elections, insisting onmaintaining one-party rule and offering some rebels positions in theadministration.   The Angolan news service ANGOP said Wednesday that President JoseEduardo dos Santos' has a peace plan calling for Savimbi to goabroad, recognize the legitimacy of the government and for the rebelmovement to be integrated into the one-party state. Savimbivehemently vetoed all these proposals at his news conference.   Savimbi said the Angolan government was under pressure, becausewithin six months, half of the 50,000 Cuban soldiers who havesupported it will have left Angola under a U.S.-mediated southernAfrican peace agreement reached in December.   The Cubans have agreed to a gradual withdrawal, to be completedby July 1991. But Savimbi said the Soviet Union and the UnitedStates have promised to ``help the Cubans leave quickly'' if thepeace talks lead to formation of a transitional unity governmentbefore then.   The U.S.-backed rebels have been fighting a guerrilla war toforce the Cuban- and Soviet-assisted government to share power sinceshortly after Angola gained independence from Portugal in 1975.   Savimbi praised Zairean President Mobutu Sese Seko for organizingthe summit, expected to be attended by leaders from Zaire, Angola,Mozambique, Cape Verde, Guinea-Bissau, Sao Tome e Principe,Botswana, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Gabon, Ivory Coast, Tanzania, Congo andMali.   According to news reports in Portugal, Savimbi might also travelto Zaire to participate in the indirect talks. Savimbi was preparingto fly out of Angola after the news conference Wednesday but did notsay where he was going.   At the request of Ivory Coast President Felix Houphouet-Boigny,the rebels have declared a ``de facto'' cease-fire and areconducting only defensive operations. He said the government army isstill attacking, ``trying to capture prisoners for their amnesty,''but with much less intensity than in the past.</TEXT></DOC>
