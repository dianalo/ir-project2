PORUBCANSKY</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   After decades of pressing for freer emigration,American officials said Tuesday that a boom in would-be immigrantslikely will force the United States to turn away more than 200,000Soviets in the next year.   Many never would have tried to leave the country before theSoviet Union liberalized its emigration procedures. Some Jews andother groups that long have been an American priority are worryingthey will be forgotten.   Refuseniks believe new U.S. procedures going into effect Oct. 1are sure to limit Jewish emigration to the United States at a timewhen they say anti-Semitism is on the rise in the Soviet Union.   ``The situation here is getting worse,'' Elena Rappoport, aleader of the Jewish refusenik group Poor Relatives, said in aninterview.   U.S. Embassy officials, following ceilings set in Washington,said they will accept 50,000 Soviet refugees next year and permitan additional 20,000 to 30,000 to enter the country on a parolesystem. Parolees are not given the same federal assistance as otherrefugees.   That's more than the roughly 50,000 the United States will admitthis year, but only a fraction of the 300,000 applications embassyofficials said they expect to receive next year. The U.S. embassysays it is receiving about 10,000 applications a month, or about90,000 so far this year.   ``There is a limit to the number of Soviet emigrants, and to thenumber of emigrants the United States can take,'' a U.S. Embassyofficial said.   The United States is appealing to other Western countries tohelp, said the diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity.   ``Nowhere is it written that the United States should be theonly destination of Soviets who want to emigrate,'' he said.   Under the new regulations, would-be refugees must fill out aquestionnaire that will be sent directly to Washington forconsideration.   Based on a review giving priority to those with relatives in theUnited States or members of groups considered to be persecuted inthe Soviet Union, such as Jewish refuseniks and Pentacostalists,officials in Washington will send notices to those who qualify forinterviews at the Moscow embassy.   U.S. officials acknowledged that the system depends on thenotoriously slow and unreliable Soviet mail. They say applicantswho hear nothing after several months will have to assume they arebeing rejected. And they said it is possible that people who facepersecution in the Soviet Union and therefore qualify for refugeestatus may fall through the cracks.   Three-quarters of the spaces are likely to go to people withparents, children, brothers, sisters or spouses already in theUnited States, embassy officials say.   Jews will no longer be able to leave the country on an Israelivisa and then apply for admission to the United States in Vienna orRome, where thousands are now waiting.   The U.S. official said new procedures will save the money spenton them in Rome or Vienna, estimated at more than $30 million, andallow it to be used to increase emigration.   The new procedure also is intended to cut down on the long linesoutside the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. The line to receive anapplication was said at one point to include thousands of people,and a spot at the front of the line reportedly cost hundreds ofdollars in bribes to Soviet police.   Jews and Armenians together still make up the vast majority ofthe applicants, but U.S. officials are seeing large increases inapplications from others.   They said 10 percent, or more than 1,000, of the applicants inAugust, were ethnic Russians, few with relatives in the UnitedStates.   One would-be applicant, 18-year-old Vladimir Azarov of Moscow,said he had some brushes with the law because of his politicalviews and wanted to receive political refugee status.   ``It's not that I have a big reason to leave the Soviet Union,it's just that I want to live in the United States,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
