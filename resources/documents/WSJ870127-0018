ZweigStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> CCIBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citicorp Chairman John Reed told securities analysts that the bank holding company's return on common stockholders' equity won't exceed 15% in 1987 because of the need to continue building the company's loan-loss reserves.    He declined, however, to indicate when the company's aggressive reserve building will stop or to disclose the level of reserves the company is seeking. The company's reserves for credit losses at the end of 1986 were $1.7 billion, or 1.30% of total loans and leases, up from $1.24 billion, or 1.06% of total loans and leases at the end of 1985.    Citicorp, the nation's largest banking company with $196.1 billion in assets, posted a return on common stockholders' equity of 13.8% in 1986, down from 15.1% in 1985.    Mr. Reed said he expects corporate loan write-offs to be higher than normal, but &quot;probably not higher than in 1986.&quot; He said, &quot;The corporate side of the business lives in a world of pretty high write-offs.&quot; Citicorp's write-offs totaled $1.36 billion at year's end.    At the meeting, Richard Braddock, head of Citicorp's consumer banking unit, said he expects consumer loan write-offs, including credit-card receivables, to increase in 1987 but at a slower rate than in 1986. The ratio of write-offs to consumer loans outstanding will be lower in 1987, he added.    Mr. Reed told analysts that his &quot;biggest concern&quot; is Citicorp's loans to developing countries. He indicated that he was worried about &quot;concessional pricing&quot; of loans to debtor countries. He also said he feared that demands for lower interest rates would spread from Mexico, which won debt concessions last year, to other countries.    Mr. Reed said that Citicorp is &quot;not likely&quot; to seek to achieve nonrecurring gains through spinoffs or sales of assets or units.    He also said he is &quot;uncomfortable&quot; with risk-adjusted capital proposals being contemplated by the Federal Reserve Board. Such proposals would require banks to support their loans with varying levels of capital based on the perceived level of risk of those loans. But Citicorp officials said that if the guidelines go into effect, they won't cause a separate program of capital building. </TEXT></DOC>
