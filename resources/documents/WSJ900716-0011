Toshio Yamaguchi, chairman of an LDP research committee oneconomic adjustment issues, specifically suggested allowingimports to meet up to 5% of Japan's domestic demand withinthe next few years, according to reports in major Japanesenewspapers. Mr. Yamaguchi's comments constituted the mostspecific endorsement so far by an LDP leader of someliberalization of the rice market, at a time when opinionsurveys have shown a majority of the general public backingsuch a move. Opening the market for Japan's traditional foodstaple was widely considered almost sacrilegious just a fewyears ago, and has become an increasingly central issue inU.S.-Japan trade relations.</LP><TEXT>   An aide to Mr. Yamaguchi said over the weekend he couldn'tconfirm the exact wording of Mr. Yamaguchi's remarks, whichcame at a seminar Friday for industrialists and governmentofficials in the summer resort town of Karuizawa. But theaide also made no effort to deny the gist of the remarks --which touched off angry reactions from party officialsinvolved in agricultural policy. Japanese newspapers reportedover the weekend that Mr. Yamaguchi, when confronted by twoformer agriculture ministers and another senior partyofficial, politely refused to retract his statement.   Officials at LDP headquarters said Mr. Yamaguchi'scomments reflected his personal views, and insisted that theparty's support for the import ban is unchanged. But Mr.Yamaguchi's statement appeared to be consistent with recentindications that some government leaders are moving to pavethe way for a shift in official policy.   Barriers to agricultural trade will be at the center ofthe current round of multinational trade talks in comingmonths. And Japanese press reports from the summit meeting inHouston indicated that Japanese officials were interpretingthe carefully worded communique on agricultural issues to beconsistent with partial liberalization of rice trade.   According to the reports, President Bush for the firsttime personally raised the rice issue with Prime MinisterToshiki Kaifu in Houston. Mr. Kaifu, in Colorado Springsfollowing the summit, told Japanese reporters over theweekend that Mr. Bush hadn't made any specific demands. ButMr. Kaifu also indicated that other countries weren't willingto accept the Japanese argument that the need for &quot;foodsecurity&quot; justifies the rice import ban.   Mr. Kaifu, who was widely quoted during elections earlierthis year as promising to import &quot;not one grain of rice,&quot; mayfeel politically secure enough to consider moderating thatposition partly because of other public-relations victoriesachieved at the summit. Mr. Kaifu gained at least tacitacceptance of Japan's decision to resume government aid toChina. And he won public acknowledgement of the importance ofsettling Japan's territorial claims against the Soviet Union,stemming from Soviet occupation of four small islands off thecoast of northern Japan at the end of World War II -- anemotionally charged issue in Japan.   Hints that political leaders were trying to lay thegroundwork for a shift on the rice policy began last month,when Komeito, an opposition party often allied with the LDP,said it would consider supporting partial liberalization ofthe market. Noboru Takeshita, a powerful former primeminister, publicly praised the Komeito stance as&quot;courageous,&quot; which some observers took as a sign that theLDP was preparing to soften its position.   Whether Mr. Kaifu or other officials will be courageousenough to satisfy U.S. advocates of agricultural trade reformis another question. The limited opening suggested by Mr.Yamaguchi would allow imports of around 500,000 tons of rice,based on recent consumption levels in Japan. U.S. AgricultureSecretary Clayton Yeutter was quoted over the weekend by theNihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's largest economic newspaper, assaying that opening only 5% of the rice market wouldn't beacceptable.</TEXT></DOC>
