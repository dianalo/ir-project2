Barbara J. Easterling, executive vice president of theCommunications Workers of America, said Wednesday that employees atsemiconductor factories frequently work under ``very dangerousconditions.''   ``The carnage in the semiconductor workplace is not scored in thespilled blood of wage earners or visible damage to their bodies,''she said. ``Instead, it is imposed on the invisible world ofworkers' chromosomes and tissues through ingestion of hazardoussubstances.''   The Semiconductor Industry Association, representing thecountry's major semiconductor manufacturers, is currently sponsoringa three-year study in response to concern over reported high ratesof miscarriages among pregnant workers and other potential healtheffects.   Testifying before the House Education and Labor subcommittee onhealth and safety, Ms. Easterling said that ``the National Institutefor Occupational Safety and Health should closely oversee theSemiconductor Industry Association study.''   ``In fact, it would be best if the federal government initiatedits own study of semiconductor factories, utilizing governmentscientists to examine possible health hazards,'' she said.   The communications union represents about 7,000 employees ofsemiconductor manufacturers, while most workers in the industry arenot covered by union contracts.   Potentially hazardous substances to which workers can be exposedat semiconductor plants include toxic solvents, acids, caustics,metals, plastics, resins and asbestos. Workers also may be exposedto radio-frequency radiation, lasers and ultraviolet light.   Lee Neal, the Semiconductor Industry Association's director ofoccupational health, safety and environmental programs, told theHouse panel that ``SIA has sponsored the development and maintenanceof the most comprehensive industry-sponsored occupational injury andillness surveillance system in operation in the U.S.''   He said Labor Department statistics show that in 1987, the rateof occupational injury and illness was 4.3 cases per 100 employeesin the semiconductor industry, as compared with an average of 11.9cases for all manufacturing sectors.   Late last year, Neal said, SIA signed an agreement with theUniversity of California at Davis to undertake the three-year, $3million study to examine the health of workers at 16 semiconductormanufacturers.</TEXT></DOC>
