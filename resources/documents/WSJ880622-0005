A large Phoenix, Ariz., thrift is expected to acquire as many as three Texas institutions in a transaction that could be announced as early as today. Bank Board Chairman M. Danny Wall said that the transaction would involve &quot;the infusion of new capital.&quot;    Such a transaction would serve notice that the Bank Board is welcoming outside investors to the Texas thrift market. Under its Southwest plan, the Bank Board has said it will merge with financial assistance or close more than 150 insolvent Texas institutions. Some would-be investors have complained that, rather than welcoming capital from outside Texas, the board has seemed primarily interested in arranging mergers between thrifts in the Texas market. </TEXT></DOC>
