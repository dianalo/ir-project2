Paul Simon is expected to suspend hiscampaign for the Democratic nomination for president on Thursdaybut will remain an official if inactive candidate, his motherconfirmed Wednesday night.   ``He is not dropping out,'' said Ruth Simon, 83, ofCollinsville, Ill. ``Too many people have advised him to stay in,and that's what he is going to do.''   Simon himself has been mum about his plans.   The Illinois senator said before Tuesday's Wisconsin primarythat he would have to reassess his campaign if he did not do well.He placed a distant fourth behind Massachusetts Gov. MichaelDukakis, Jesse Jackson and Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore.   ``He is just suspending his campaign,'' in part because of thehigh cost of media advertising, Mrs. Simon told radio station WRYTin Edwardsville.   But, she said, ``He's going to hang in there till the end.''   Mrs. Simon, who said her son called her Tuesday night, said heplanned a week's vacation with his family.   In Washington on Wednesday, congressional sources speaking oncondition of anonymity said Simon's campaign suspension meant hewould not seek to participate in campaign debates scheduled in NewYork before that state's April 19 primary.   Michael Kreloff, the Simon campaign's Illinois legal counsel,said Wednesday night that he could not confirm what Simon would sayin a Washington news conference scheduled for Thursday.   Simon's remaining in the race, even as an inactive candidate,would allow him to garner more delegates before the DemocraticNational Convention in July in Atlanta, and hang on to those he has.   Under party rules and because of their showings in the March 15Illinois primary, Simon is entitled to 47 at-large delegates fromIllinois, while Jackson is entitled to 13 and Dukakis none.   A Simon withdrawal would automatically shift his 47 delegates toJackson, who is now behind in the delegate count. Those 47 would beenough to put him ahead.   Kreloff said that if Simon suspends active campaigning, insteadof dropping out of the race, it would be understandable.   ``If, in fact, that's what he does, it would seem to be asensible position, given that there is no clear favorite,'' Kreloffsaid. ``I think it's the fairest thing to do for Illinois voterswho voted March 15 ... so the delegates reflect what the voterswanted.''   While an inactive Simon campaign could block Jackson fromgarnering the 47 at-large delegates Simon will get, one Simonbacker said Wednesday she does not think the senator is engaging ina ``stop-Jackson'' movement.   ``That's just not Paul Simon,'' said Luellen Laurenti of Normal,an elected Simon delegate and a member of the Democratic StateCentral Committee.   ``I still think that Paul wants to be ... in a position to havea little leverage in the outcome of this thing and the outcome ofthe platform,'' Ms. Laurenti said. ``I think he does have a visionand he does have an internal passion. He just has trouble showingit on the outside.   ``There are just too many important things that need to bedecided ... for Simon to say `I'm throwing in the towel now. He hasa right to have some say,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
