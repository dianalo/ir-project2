Instead, this income would be recognizedover the life of the swap. It also would require that subsequent changesin the market value of swaps, except for most swaps accounted for as hedges,be reflected in income during the period in which the changes occur. Thisproposed Call Report instruction has been developed jointly by the Officeof the Comptroller of the Currency (``OCC''), the Federal Reserve Board(``FRB''), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (``FDIC''), underthe auspices of the Council. The instruction will be effective for swapcontracts entered into after December 31, 1988, and the first Call Reportaffected will be the Call Report for March 31, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be received on or before January 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>All comments should be mailed to Robert J.

The agencies are not relying upon generallyaccepted accounting principles as the reporting standard for these transactionsbecause there is an overall lack of authoritative accounting guidance pertainingto swap income and such guidance is not likely to be forthcoming from accountingrulemaking authorities for some time. When and if accounting rulemakingauthorities adopt authoritative guidance for the recognition of swap income,the banking agencies will reconsider the appropriateness of any reportingstandard for swaps that becomes inconsistent with generally accepted accountingprinciples. <ITAG tagnum="84">Proscription on the Immediate Recognition of Fees and Spreads </ITAG>In the absence of specific authoritative accounting pronouncements in thisarea, banks have generally followed two basic approaches in accountingfor swap income. One method recognizes the arrangement fee and the discountedpresent value of the spread on a portfolio of swaps, net of a provisionfor related credit risk and administrative costs, as profit at the inceptionof the swap. The second method amortizes the arrangement fees and takesthe spread into income over the life of the swap, i.e., income is recognizedas the swap payments are accrued each period. The Council believes the second method of income recognition is the moreappropriate method for Call Report purposes. Swap income should not berecognized at inception, since that practice is not in accordance withthe fundamental accounting principle that income earned as a result ofa contractual obligation should be recognized over the life of the contract.The logic that the income is earned over that time period rather than atthe inception of the swap is supported by the fact that, in the case ofa bank acting as a principal in a swap contract, credit risk, interestrate risk, and administrative costs are incurred over the life of the contract.Therefore, since costs and risks are incurred by the bank over the swap'slife, it is appropriate that the income from the swap be recognized overthe life of the swap. The immediate recognition of income leads to higher reported income andcapital at the time a swap is booked. However, substantial risks remainover the life of the contract and the recorded income may not be ultimatelyrealized due to credit losses or adverse interest rate changes. Consequently,the Council believes that income recognition at the swap's inception isan unsafe or unsound banking practice. <ITAG tagnum="84">Recording Changes In Market Value After Inception </ITAG>The second aspect of the proposed Call Report instruction deals with whetherchanges in the market values of swaps after their inception should be recordedin income in the period in which they occur. The value of an imperfectlymatched swap portfolio can change markedly with changes in interest rates,and the value of an individual swap contract is also subject to changeif the creditworthiness of the counterparty changes. Therefore, it is importantto set a reporting standard that currently records such changes in value.The proposed Call Report instruction would require that changes in themarket value of swaps (except most swaps accounted for as hedges) be recordedin the period in which they occur, with the cumulative change in marketvalue being reported in the Report of Condition. Therefore, any lossesin value in a bank's swap portfolio would be reflected in current periodincome rather than being deferred, thus providing more discipline to banksengaging in the swap market. <ITAG tagnum="84">Issues for Specific Public Comment </ITAG>The Council is aware of the current diversity in practice in accountingfor swaps. The proposed Call Report instruction would promulgate the accountingconsidered appropriate for supervisory purposes commensurate with the federalbanking agencies' safety and soundness responsibilities. The Council intendsto seek general public comment concerning the proposed Call Report instructionand encourages specific comments on the following additional issues: 1. The proposal would require that arrangement fees and spread income berecognized as income over the life of the swap contract. The Council requestscomment on whether certain costs directly related to originating a swapcontract should be deferred and amortized over the life of the swap, similarto the method prescribed for loan origination costs under FASB StatementNo. 91, ``Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originatingor Acquiring Loans and Initial Direct Costs of Leases''. The Council alsoseeks comment on an alternative to deferring the costs. This alternativeis to allow the arrangement fee (but not the spread) to be recorded asincome at inception, to the extent it does not exceed the direct costsof originating the related swap contract. 2. The proposed Call Report instruction would require that changes in themarket value of swaps subsequent to inception (except most swaps accountedfor as hedges) be recognized in income during the period they occur. Marketvaluation methods that have been used by banks include the following: a. The present value of the known cash flows from the swap is calculatedusing as a discount rate the current rate on a Treasury security of equalremaining maturity plus the excess at inception of the swap rate (definedas the mid-point of the fixed rate side's bid and ask rate) over the rateon a Treasury security of equal maturity. b. The present value of the known cash flows from the swap is calculatedusing as a discount rate the current swap rate (defined as the mid-pointof the fixed rate side's bid and ask rate) on a swap with equal remainingmaturity. c. The present value of the known cash flows from the swap is calculatedusing as discount rates the zero coupon rates derived from the currentswap yield curve. Swap yields for each maturity are defined as the midpointof the fixed rate side's bid and ask rates. The Council requests comment on which of these valuation methods is mostappropriate. The Council also requests details on alternatives to the abovemethodologies that may be more appropriate in all or certain circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Instruction </ITAG>The text of the proposed instruction follows: <ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Call Report Glossary Entry for Interest Rate Swaps</ITAG>An interest rate swap, in its simplest form, entails an agreement betweentwo parties (``counterparties'') to exchange interest payments for a specifiedperiod of time. These interest payments are calculated on a specified principalvalue, called the notional amount. Ordinarily, counterparties are onlyobligated to pay to each other the interest due on this amount and arenot obligated to repay the underlying or related principal.Interest rate swaps are often used to, in effect, transform the interestrates associated with assets or liabilities from fixed-rate to floating-rateor vice versa, or from one floating rate index to another. Banks generallyengage in interest rate swaps either to hedge their exposures to interestrate risk or to generate fee income by acting as intermediaries betweenother swap participants or by trading in swaps.Since notional principal amounts are not counterparty obligations for single-currencyinterest rate swaps, these amounts should not be reported on Schedule RC,Balance Sheet. These amounts should be reported on Schedule RC-L, ``Commitmentsand Contingencies,'' in Memoranda Item 3, ``Notional Value of All OutstandingInterest Rate Swaps,'' as discussed in the instructions for that schedule.Some cross-currency interest rate swaps_those involving obligations ofthe respective parties denominated in different currencies_also obligatethe counterparties to exchange principal amounts at maturity. Such principalamounts shall be reported on the FFIEC 031, 032, and 033 as ``Commitmentsto Purchase Foreign Currencies and U.S. Dollar Exchange,'' in Item 5 ofSchedule RC-L (not reported on the FFIEC 034). Such transactions can altera bank's foreign exchange risk position.Bank management should evaluate the credit risk associated with interestrate swap activities. An allowance for credit losses should be maintainedthat is sufficient to cover any estimated credit losses associated withswap activities.Under interest rate swaps, the amounts of interest receivable and payableshould be accrued as of the end of each calendar quarter (or more frequently).The receivable and payable balances relating to a particular swap may bereported net only if a contractual right of offset exists and the swappayments are exchanged on a net basis. The aggreate amounts of receivablesand payables should be reported as ``Other Assets'' and ``Other Liabilities,''respectively, on Schedule RC-Balance Sheet (Items 11 and 20, respectively)and on Schedule RC-F (``Other Assets,'' Item 3) and Schedule RC-G (``OtherLiabilities,'' Item 4). For purposes of these reports, receivables andpayables shall not be accrued for amounts applicable to periods beyondthe report date.In no case shall income be recognized at the inception of a swap. Arrangementfees must be recognized as income over the life of the swap contract. Spreadincome, i.e., the difference between future cash receipts and paymentsfor a portfolio of swaps, must be recognized only as accrued for the currentperiod, i.e., not beyond the report date.A bank's activities using interest rate swaps, both as hedges and non-hedges,are subject to review by examiners. Accordingly, banks must fully documenttheir swap hedging policies and transactions. A pattern of excessive andunsatisfactorily documented hedge swap terminations may lead examinersto conclude that an institution has in effect been trading in swaps andrequire that the results of such swap activities be restated and reportedas swaps not used for hedging purposes.FASB Statement No. 80, <T3>Accounting for Futures Contracts,</T3> for swaps denominated in onecurrency, and Statement No. 52,<T3> Foreign Currency Translation,</T3> for swaps denominated in more thanone currency, should be consulted for additional information regardingaccounting standards to be applied by analogy to interest rate swaps.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reporting for Hedge Swaps</ITAG>Swaps that are used to reduce a bank's interest rate risk exposure maybe reported as hedges of such risk if, in principle, all of the hedgingcriteria set forth in FASB Statement No. 80 have been fulfilled. Therefore,for example, the specific item to be hedged must expose the enterpriseto price (or interest rate) risk, and the swap must reduce that exposureand be designated as a hedge of that item. Swaps denominated in more thanone currency that are used to reduce a bank's interest rate or foreignexchange risk may be reported as hedges of such risks if, in principle,all of the hedging criteria set forth in FASB Statement No. 52 have beenmet. However, in no case may swaps used to hedge other swaps be reportedas hedges. For example, offsetting swaps for which a bank is acting asan intermediary are not swaps that reduce its interest rate risk exposure.If the hedge criteria are met, the accounting for the swap shall be relatedto the accounting for the hedged item so that changes in the market valueof the swap are recognized in income when the effects of related changesin the price or interest rate of the hedged item are recognized. Therefore,the income or expense from the swap should be reported in Schedule RI,Income Statement, in the same line item as the income or expense from theunderlying hedged item. In most cases, the swap's accrued interest incomeor expense for the period shall adjust the underlying interest income orexpense of the hedged item. In addition, the change in the market valueof the swap shall be deferred and accounted for as part of the carryingvalue of the item being hedged, and reflected as an adjustment of the relatedinterest income or expense over the life of the hedged item. However, ifthe swap hedges an underlying item which is carried at market value (markto market accounting), a change in the market value of the related swapshall not be deferred but rather should be recognized in income in theperiod the change in value occurs.If a swap is accounted for as a hedge (of an underlying item not carriedat market value), then the gain or loss on an early termination of theswap shall be defferred, recognized as part of the carrying value of thehedged item, and amortized over the remaining life of the hedged item orthe swap, whichever is shorter. Generally, terminations of swaps that areused for hedging purposes should not be significant in relation to thetotal number or notional amount of swaps that are hedges.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reporting for Non-Hedge Swaps</ITAG>For all interest rate swaps that are not reportable as hedges as set forthin the preceding section, the income or expense associated with the accrualof swap receivables and payables shall be reported as ``Other NoninterestIncome,'' in Schedule RI (Income Statement), Item 5.f. (item 5.b. on theFFIEC 034), or as ``Other Noninterest Expense,'' in Schedule RI, Item 7.c.,as appropriate.At the first Call Report date following the inception of an interest rateswap, any change in the market value of that swap since its inception shallbe recognized in current period income or expense. At each successive CallReport date, any change in the market value of that swap since the previousCall Report date must be recognized in current period income or expense,using a consistent methodology.These changes in the market value of swaps shall be reflected in ScheduledRI, Item 5.f. (item 5.b. on the FFIEC 034), ``Other Noninterest Income,''or Item 7.c., ``Other Noninterest Expense,'' as appropriate. The cumulativevaluation exposure (asset or liability) on the balance sheet shall be reportedas ``Other assets,'' in Schedule RC, Item 11, or as ``Other liabilities,''in Schedule RC, Item 20.If a non-hedge swap is terminated early, any amounts the reporting bankreceives from or pays to the counterparty on early termination shall bereported net as ``Other Noninterest Income,'' in Schedule RI, Item 5.f.(item 5.b. on the FFIEC 034), or as ``Other Noninterest Expense,'' in ScheduleRI, Item 7.c., as appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="21">November 4, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert J.
