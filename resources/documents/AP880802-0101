The final checks of the house ``ran a bit longer thanexpected,'' said Zoe Coles, spokeswoman at the Business DesignCenter in north London.   She said the center had installed 3,200 seats in six days,transforming the exhibition and conference center into a theaterthe size of the Kirov's Mariinsky theater in Leningrad.   The week-long appearance by the Kirov performing ``Giselle'' atthe Business Design Center is the second of the Kirov'sthree-theater London tour.   Last week the company performed ``Giselle'' at the LondonColiseum, home of the English National Opera, and next week willdance ``Le Corsaire'' at Covent Garden.   Ms. Coles said that using the Business Design Center meant morepeople could come because of cheaper tickets. Tickets to theBusiness Design Center performance cost from $14.50 to $60,compared with $76 to $119 at Covent Garden.</TEXT></DOC>
