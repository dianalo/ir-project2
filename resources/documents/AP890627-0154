Thousands of amendments have been proposed, but in morethan 200 years only 26 have been ratified.   There are two ways to amend the Constitution, one initiated byCongress and one by the state legislatures.   Under the Constitution's Article V, a proposed amendmentoriginating in Congress must be approved by two-thirds votes in bothhouses. It then must be approved by 38 state legislatures.   Two-thirds of the state legislatures may call for aconstitutional convention. Any amendment approved by that conventionmust then be ratified by three-fourths of the states.</TEXT></DOC>
