The increases were propelled by benefit increases,including a rise in the Social Security taxes paid byemployers, the Labor Department said.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's not an explosion but it's steady pressure,&quot; saidAudrey Freedman, a labor economist at the Conference Board, abusiness research organization. Many economists see thelabor-cost figure as an important indicator of inflation,because salaries and benefits are a large share of businesscosts and ultimately must be reflected in prices.   In the 12 months ended in March, wages, salaries andbenefits for private sector employees increased 5.2%, thebiggest rise since they climbed 5.4% in the 12 months endedJune 1984. That figure was 4.8% for all 1989 and 4.6% in the12 months ended in March of that year.   Meanwhile, in a separate report, the Labor Department saidmajor collective-bargaining agreements settled in the firstquarter provided wage increases averaging 3.8% in the firstyear and 3.3% a year over the life of the pacts.   Those figures were well above the ones in previouscontracts negotiated by the same parties. The previouscontracts, generally negotiated two or three years ago, paid2.3% in the first year and 2.2% a year for the full term ofthe contracts. The figures don't include benefits. Agreementsin the latest report covered 318,000 workers.   Increases in benefits made up most of the 5.2% increase intotal compensation for workers over the 12 months ended inMarch. Benefit costs to employers rose 7.2% in that period,up from a 5.4% rise in the year-earlier period. Wages andsalaries rose only 4.2%, the same increase registered for the12 months ended March 1989.   White collar workers received wage and salary increases of4.6% during the 12-month period, faring better than bluecollar workers, who posted gains of 3.7%. Labor costscontinued to increase more rapidly in services than ingoods-producing industries, though the difference was small-- 4.2% versus 4%.   Including employees of state and local governments, butnot federal employees, the department's employment cost indexrose 1.7% in the first quarter, compared with a 1.2% rise inthe first quarter of 1989. The index rose 1% in last year'sfourth quarter.   In the 12 months ended in March, this index was up 5.5%.It rose 5% for the full year 1989, and 4.8% in the 12 monthsended in March 1989.   Unlike most of the government's economic statistics, noneof these figures are adjusted for seasonal variations.</TEXT></DOC>
