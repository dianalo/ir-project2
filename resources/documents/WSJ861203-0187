Arianespace's chairman, Frederic d'Allest, told a news conference in Bordeaux that the launches, suspended after a rocket failure in May, wouldn't be resumed as planned in February. He declined to predict precisely when they would resume but said he thought it would be within three to seven weeks of the February target, which would put the resumption in March or April, unless there are further delays.    As a result, he said, Arianespace would be able to carry out only seven of its planned eight launches next year. The eighth is to be pushed back to January 1988.    Officials at Arianespace and at Societe Europeenne de Propulsion, the company that makes the ignition system that has caused three Ariane launch failures, say that they have solved the ignition problem by designing a new system and that the delays are caused by the need to fully test the new system.    Mr. d'Allest said the company also is investing in a two-year program to completely overhaul the rocket's problem-plagued third stage.    Meanwhile, because Arianespace is expected to be operating again well before the U.S. space shuttle, Mr. d'Allest said he had received eight new satellite launch orders since the European program was suspended, for a total of 16 so far this year. The total includes five satellites originally scheduled to be launched by the space shuttle. Company officials say they hope to book as many as four new orders before the end of the year. </TEXT></DOC>
