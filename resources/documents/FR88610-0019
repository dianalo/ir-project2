The first two phases are designed to assistUSDA in meeting its research and development objectives and will be supportedwith Federal funds. The purpose of the third phase is to pursue the commercialapplications or objectives of the research carried out in phases I andII through the use of private, non-Federal funds.(a) Phase I is the initial stage in which the scientific and technicalmerit and feasibility of an idea related to one of the research areas describedin the program solicitation is evaluated, normally for a period not toexceed 6 months.(b) Phase II is the principal research or research and development effortin which the results from Phase I are expanded upon and further pursued,normally for a period not to exceed 24 months. Only those small businessespreviously receiving phase I awards are eligible to submit phase II proposals.For each phase I project funded the awardee may apply for a phase II awardonly once. Phase I awardees who for valid reasons cannot apply for phaseII support in the next fiscal year funding cycle may apply for supportnot later than the second fiscal year funding cycle.(c) Phase III is the pursuit of commercial objectives resulting from theFederally supported work carried out in phases I and II. This portion ofthe project is performed by the small business firm and privately fundedby a non-Federal source through the use of a follow-on funding commitment.A follow-on funding commitment is an agreement between the small businessfirm and a provider of follow-on capital for a specified amount of fundsto be made available to the small business for further development of theireffort upon achieving certain mutually agreed upon technical objectivesduring phase II.<ITAG tagnum="56">Subpart C_Preparation and Submission of Proposals</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 3403.5</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Requests for proposals.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Phase I.</T3> A program solicitation requesting phase I proposals willbe prepared each fiscal year in which funds are made available for thispurpose.

Proposals principallyfor the development of proven concepts toward commercialization or formarket research should not be submitted since such efforts are consideredthe responsibility of the private sector and therefore are not supportedby USDA.(c) A proposal must be limited to only one topic. The same proposal maynot be submitted under more than one topic. However, an organization maysubmit separate proposals on the same topic. Where similar research isdiscussed under more than one topic, the proposer should choose that topicwhose description appears most relevant to the proposer's research concept.Duplicate proposals will be returned to the applicant without review.(d) Phase I applicants should submit a research proposal of no more than25 pages, including cover page, budget, and all proposal-related enclosuresor attachments.

(3) The inclusion of proprietary information is discouraged unless it isnecessary for the proper evaluation of the proposal. The proprietary informationincluded should be limited, set off on a separate page, and keyed to thetext by numbers. It should be confined to a few critical technical itemswhich, if disclosed, could jeopardize the obtaining of foreign or domesticpatents. Also, trade secrets, salaries, or other information which couldjeopardize commercial competitiveness should be keyed and set off on separatepage. Proposals or reports which set off any large amount of informationmay be found unacceptable by USDA. (1) <T3>Organizational management information. </T3>Before the award of anSBIR funding agreement, USDA requires the submission of certain organizationalmanagement and financial information to assure the responsibility of theproposer.

(b) Phase I and phase II proposals will be judged competitively in a two-stageprocess, based primarily upon scientific or technical merit. First, eachproposal will be screened by USDA scientists to ensure that it is responsiveto stated requirements contained in the program solicitation. Proposalsfound to be responsive will be technically evaluated by peer scientistsknowledgeable in the appropriate scientific field using the criteria listedin andSection; 3403.11 or andSection; 3403.12 of this part, as appropriate.Proposals found to be nonresponsive will be returned to the proposing firmwithout review.   (c) Both internal and external peer reviewers may be used during the technicalevaluation stage of this process. Selections will be made from among recognizedspecialists who are uniquely qualified by training and experience in theirrespective fields to render expert advice on the merit of proposals received.It is anticipated that such experts will include those located in universities,Government, and non-profit research organizations. If possible, USDA intendsthat peer review groups shall be balanced with minority and female representationand with an equitable age distribution.   (d) Technical reviewers will base their conclusions and recommendationson information contained in the phase I or phase II proposal. It cannotbe assumed that reviewers are acquainted with any experiments referredto within a proposal, with key individuals, or with the firm itself. Therefore,the proposal should be self-contained and written with the care and thoroughnessaccorded papers for publication.   (e) Final decisions will be made by USDA based upon the ratings assignedby reviewers and consideration of other factors, including the potentialcommercial application, possible duplication of other research, any criticalUSDA requirements, program balance, and budget limitations. In addition,the follow-on funding commitment will be a consdieration for phase II proposals.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 3403.11</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Phase I evaluation criteria.</ITAG>   USDA plans to select for award those proposals offering the best valueto the Nations, with approximately equal consideration given to each ofthe following criteria except for item (a) which will receive twice thevlaue of any of the other items:   (a) The scientific/technical quality of the phase I research plan and itsrelevance to the stated objectives, with special emphasis on innovativenessand originality.   (b) Importance of the problem or opportunity and anticipated benefits ofthe proposed research, if successful.   (c) Adequacy of the phase I objectives to show incremental progress towardproving the feasibility of approach.

Thephase II proposal will be reviewed for overall merit based on the followingcriteria with each item receiving approximately equal weight except forparagraph (a)(1) of this section, which will receive twice the value ofany of the other items:(1) The scientific/technical quality of the proposed research, with specialemphasis on innovativeness and originality.(2) Degree to which phase I objectives were met (as indicated in phaseI final report.)(3) The technical, economic, and/or social importance of the problem oropportunity and anticipated benefits if phase II research is successful.(4) The adequacy of the phase II objectives to meet the problem or opportunity.(5) The qualifications of the principal investigator(s) and other key personnelto carry out the proposed work.(6) Reasonableness of the budget requested for the work proposed.(b) In the event that two or more phase II proposals are of approximatelyequal technical merit, the follow-on funding commitment for continued developmentin phase III will be an important consideration. The value of the commitmentwill depend upon the degree of commitment made by non-Federal investors,with the maximum value resulting from a signed agreement with reasonableterms for an amount at least equal to the funding requested from USDA inphase II.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 3403.13</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Availability of information.</ITAG>Information regarding the peer review process will be made available tothe extent permitted under the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552),the Privacy Act (5 U.S.C. 552a), and implementing Departmental and otherFederal regulations.
