The troops were searching for rocket launching sites andguerrilla strongholds when they spotted a guerrilla ring and openedfire, an army spokesman said. He said there were no army casualties.   Israel radio said the guerrillas were apparently on their way tocarry out an attack in the security zone, a six-to-10 mile widestrip of land north of the Israeli border.   Troops discovered three bodies while searching the area of theclash, the radio said.   Neither the army spokesman nor the radio identified the group towhich the guerrillas belonged. The location of the clash also wasnot disclosed.   The incursion north of the security zone was the first reportedby the army since a two-day operation early last month in whichthree Israeli soldiers were killed and 17 wounded. Forty guerrillasof the Iranian-backed Shiite Moslem Hezbollah (Party of God)movement were killed.   On May 25, about 600 Israeli-backed Lebanese militiamen assistedby Israeli artillery and helicopters again attacked Hezbollahstrongholds. Forty Hezbollah guerrillas were killed and about 30wounded in clashes. Five militiamen were also wounded.   Israel radio quoted a senior officer in the army's northerncommand as calling Wednesday's search operation a ``routine missionon the security zone's border'' carried out by a small infantryforce.   Israel established its security zone in June 1985 when itwithdrew the bulk of its troops from Lebanon following a three-yearoccupation. The zone is patrolled by Israeli troops andIsraeli-backed Lebanese militiamen.</TEXT></DOC>
