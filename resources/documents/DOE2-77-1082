Having technology in technical readinessbefore an energy price shock will minimize future economic problems dueto energy price shocks and also promote future economic stability. Typically,the market fails to take certain steps during normal growth, while belatedlyrushing to catch up during an energy crisis. Based on an evolving bodyof knowledge about the relationships among energy prices, technologycommercialization, and recessions and depressions, development of efficient-energytechnologies must be far better managed by government and the privatesector during both normal economic growth and energy crises. Japaneseand British government management of research and development until thetechnology reaches the market is in sharp contrast to US practice. Ifthe US government now emphasizes basic energy technology research atthe expense of applied energy technology development, danger may be onlya few years hence. This danger is simply that sufficient energy technologywill not be available to ease the transition of the next energy shock,and the resulting impact on the economy will be much more severe thannecessary. 32 refs., 4 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
