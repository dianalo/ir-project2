If the results are borne out in larger studies, it couldlead to the first safe and effective treatment of thedisease, which affects 50,000 people, almost all of themblack, in the U.S. each year. The drug, hydroxyurea, has beenused to treat bone marrow disorders, skin cancer andleukemia.</LP><TEXT>   In the same trial, a new genetically engineered anemiadrug called erythropoietin, or EPO, yielded no improvement insickle cell patients, the researchers said.   &quot;We are very optimistic about this,&quot; said H. FranklinBunn, director of hematology research at Brigham andamp; Women'sHospital, Boston, and a professor of medicine at HarvardMedical School. &quot;Treatment until now has been aimed atgetting patients out of acute pain crisis&quot; and managingsymptoms while they are hospitalized, he said. &quot;There's notreatment that gets at the root cause of the sicklingprocess.&quot; In addition to relieving symptoms, the treatmentcould yield huge cost savings, he said.   The study included just five patients, and Dr. Bunn saidit is premature for the average doctor to administer thetreatment outside of an academic medical center. The studyappears in today's New England Journal of Medicine.   Sickle cell anemia, named for the shape of red blood cellsamong sufferers of the illness, is an inherited disease thatinhibits blood circulation, leading to joint pain, bloodclots, long-term anemia and loss of energy. The pain usuallycomes in episodes, often with &quot;explosive suddenness,&quot; Dr.Bunn said. Symptoms can last from two to 10 days and oftenrequire hospital treatment.   Hydroxyurea stimulates production of a protein calledfetal hemoglobin, which blocks the sickling of red bloodcells. The protein is prevalent in the blood during fetaldevelopment and up to about six months after birth, Dr. Bunnsaid, when the gene responsible for its production switchesoff. &quot;But the gene is still there. You can look athydroxyurea as a way of reawakening the fetal hemoglobin geneand getting it to go back to work.&quot;   The five patients in the study were initially treated withEPO, which is currently used to treat anemia in kidneydialysis patients and which Dr. Bunn said increased fetalhemoglobin levels in monkeys. Then three patients were givendoses of hydroxyurea. During a subsequent period, the threepatients were given both therapies in combination.   The three patients on hydroxyurea reported markedly fewerpain episodes, a subjective measure of effectiveness that Dr.Bunn said was supported by analysis of blood chemistry. &quot;Theyare less anemic, their red blood cells survive longer, theyhave less jaundice and they have less sickling,&quot; he said.   But blood analysis during periods when the patients wereon EPO, with or without hydroxyurea, indicated EPO wasineffective. &quot;We are disappointed that it didn't work,&quot; Dr.Bunn said, noting that there was no effect, even at very highdoses. That could rule out at least one potential market forEPO, which is sold by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, Calif.   Hydroxyurea, which is marketed by Bristol-Myers SquibbCo., New York, costs about $500 a year for the averagepatient, Dr. Bunn said, a price that could lead to &quot;enormoussavings&quot; if it keeps patients out of the hospital. An eightto 10-day hospital stay could cost up to $10,000.   Mark A. Goldberg, also of Brigham andamp; Women's hematologydivision, was principal author of the study, which includedresearch done at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.</TEXT></DOC>
