Brian Keenan, a teacher with dual British and Irish nationality,was kidnapped April 11, 1986 on his way to the American Universityin Beirut, where he had just begun to work.   ``If we forget, the world forgets,'' said his sister, BrendaGillham, who stood outside the city hall with three other familymembers during Wednesday's vigil. ``We must keep the fight going.''   She said the vigil was both for the family members and to ``askgovernments: How many more days can a normal human being take? Maybethe governments will start to think about it.''   Keenan, 38, was using an Irish passport when he was abducted, butboth the Irish and British governments are working toward hisrelease.
