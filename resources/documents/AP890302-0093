The boat people were among about 11,000 Vietnamese who havesailed into this British colony since it adopted a tough new policylast year that for most of them rules out resettlement.   Many of the boat people waved and smiled as they boarded the HongKong Dragon Airlines' Boeing 737 jet, but some appearedapprehensive. A few carried cassette tape recorders; others wereempty-handed.   The 46 men, 19 women and 10 children were accompanied by two U.N.officials and an interpreter on the 2{-hour flight to Hanoi.   When they touched down in Hanoi, they were met by Vietnamese,U.N. and British officials, Hong Kong radio reported.   The boat people were to be briefed and taken to a transit campabout six miles from Hanoi airport, the radio said.   ``This is an important start,'' Security Branch official MichaelHanson told reporters in Hong Kong.   The Hong Kong government hopes the successful repatriation of thefirst group will convince other boat people to return home from thecolony's crowded camps, now bulging with nearly 26,000 Vietnamese.   The repatriation was arranged under an agreement reached byVietnam and the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees. Hanoi promisednot to prosecute its returning citizens and to allow theinternational organization to monitor their treatment back home.   The UNHCR agreed to provide assistance to the repatriatedVietnamese. Returning adults received $50 and their children $25,according to U.N. officials, and other unspecified assistance willbe offered.   The U.N. agency, which has offices in Vietnam, has vowed toclosely monitor the fate of boat people who return home.   ``I would tend to say if too many of them get into trouble, itwill be known,'' Alexander Casella, one of the two U.N. officials onthe flight, said Wednesday. He was expected to remain in Vietnam oneweek and accompany the boat people to home villages after theirbrief stay in Hanoi.   Vietnamese have sailed by the tens of thousands to ports ofasylum in non-Communist southeast Asia since the Vietnam War endedin 1975, but only a handful had previously asked to go back.   This British colony, about 500 miles north of Vietnam, longclassified all arriving Vietnamese as refugees who could stay in thecolony until resettled elsewhere. Less than two dozen of the morethan 120,000 Vietnamese who have come to Hong Kong returned homebetween 1979 and 1988.   But to stem the growing influx of boat people, the colony adopteda new policy effective last June under which Vietnamese areconsidered refugees only if they can prove they fled their homelandbecause of persecution.   The vast majority do not meet that standard under a governmentscreening program and are classified as illegal immigrants. HongKong wants to forcibly send them home, but Hanoi insists it willonly accept those who want to return.   Vietnam originally approved repatriation applications from 145boat people in Hong Kong, but when Hanoi officials arrived in thecolony to issue travel documents last month only 81 still wanted togo home.   Six backed out at the last minute.   Despite the harsh new policy, boat people continue to sail to thecolony, with 356 arriving last month, up from 114 for January and 91in February 1988.   Meanwhile, resettlement of the approximately 15,000 Vietnamese inHong Kong camps granted refugee status received a recent boost withseveral countries, including the United States, agreeing to increasethe number they accept.   Officials believe 4,000 refugees may be resettled this year fromHong Kong, up from 2,772 last year and 2,212 in 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
