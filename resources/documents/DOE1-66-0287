Theproperties of UF{sub 6} determine how it must be handled and make directobservation impossible. To determine that the material in a containeris UF{sub 6}, one must use other instruments in addition to a scale.Because of the very large volume expanision of UF{sub 6} upon melting,diligence must be exercised in filling cylinders in which the UF{sub6} is partially solidified. A cylinder of liquified UF{sub 6} with noullage is potentially the equivalent of a superheated hot water heater,not just a hydraulically overpressurized cylinder. Finally, UF{sub 6}can be handled safely by careful attention to the suggested precautions.9 refs., 2 tabs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
