(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>How Rockwell Launched its EISandM;Having spent sizable sums of money to automate the grass roots operations oftheir companies, executives are now beginning to look for ways to bringautomation to Mahogany Row.andP;  a good way to do so is through an executiveinformation system (EIS).andP;  Such a movement is under way at the EL Segundo,Calif.-based North American Aircraft (NAA) Division of Rockwell InternationalCorp.andM;One of Rockwell's foremost reasons for adopting an EIS is to better respondto th changing climate in which it does business.andP;  As the prime contractor ofthe B-1B Air Force bomber, NAA is one of the major aerospace companies beingaffected by the downturn in defense spending.andP;  The division has seen thisbusiness dwindle as the B-1B production program comes to a close.andO;Consequently, NAA is making major changes in its work force structure, itscost management and even in its physical facilities.andP;  The demands forrelevant executive information to help manage these changes have prompted themove to EIS.andM;The division's executive council members, for example, found themselvesspending several hours each month in a cost performance presentation.andP;  Asdescribed by Art Goudreault, vice president of material and one of the earlyproponents of EIS, the council would typically wade through pages of detailedcost and budget reports for each organization in the division.andP;  A questionwould surface occasionally, and a council member would be charged with comingup with a solution.andP;  Yet for every page that required action, there were manypages in the briefing that did not.andM;Goudreault wanted to know if there was some way to spend less time lookingfor problems and more time solving them.andP;  He approached Nick Corritori,director of the information systems department, and asked for help.andM;At about this time, a decision was made to move the executives from officeslocated in a centralized building to facilities located closer to theirdepartments.andP;  The division president, John Pierro, then faced the problem ofhow to communicate with VPs who were no longer down the hall.andP;  Pierro'ssolution was to direct IS to equip each executive's office with a personalcomputer connected to a network with electronic mail capabilities.andM;The office automation and telecommunications groups began developing a planto automate the executive suites.andP;  Their efforts resulted in an executivenetwork based on a Digital Equipment Corp. MicroVAX 3100 hub and a Digital PCLAN 3100 server.andP;  The MicroVAX 3100 runs the electronic mail and calendaringsystems.andP;  The 3100 server handles network communications among the 14executive and secretarial workstations.andP;  A Systems Network Architecturegateway connects the PCs to IBM mainframe applications such as theInformation Management System (IMS) database management system.andM;The workstations consist of IBM-compatible 386 PCs running MS-DOS, VGA colormonitors, ink jet color printers for the executives and laser printers forthe secretaries.andP;  Other services planned include electronic fax, scanners andconnection to external news services such as Dow Jones News/Retrieval.andP;  Withplans for the network in place, a question naturally followed: What elseshould we do with these machines besides write letters?andP;  The answer: EIS.andM;Goals of EISandM;Pierro and Goudreault were joined by Howard Chambers, vice president andprogram manager of the B-1B program, as the primary sponsors of the EIS.andO;They intuitively sensed the value of the EIS and its impact on the division.andO;Pierro saw EIS as a tool to provide him and his VPs with information thatwould lead to better and faster decision making.andP;  It could also be used as afeedback monitor to gauge how effectively decisions were being implemented.andM;To accomplish these objectives, Pierro established several guidelines forthose of us in IS to follow in developing the system.andM;* Derived Information.andP;  The computer is great at storing mountains of data.andO;But where in those mountains are the granules on which the executives shouldfocus?andP;  Pierro coined the term &quot;derived information&quot; to describe mechanismsthat tell not only what is wrong but why.andP;  The concept of derived informationbecame the philosphical backbone of the EIS.andM;* Anticipating Questions.andP;  The EIS must be more than an expensive page turnerfor static reports.andP;  It must have features that make it useful as aninvestigative tool.andP;  Executives, however, cannot always anticipate what theywill need to know about a subject before they see it.andP;  And executive userscannot wait for IS to process a programming request just to create a simplereport or sort a file.andM;Accordingly, we anticipated three requirements right away: a database,drill-down functions and what-if capabilities.andP;  Storing the data for the EISin a relational database to a sufficient depth of detail is essential toanticipating unexpressed requirements for data.andP;  Drill-down refers to theability to navigate through a hierarchy of increasingly finer levels ofdetail in the database.andP;  As the name implies, what-if describes tools fortrend analysis and answering ad hoc queries.andM;* Soft Data.andP;  Simply seeing numbers and graphs is not enough.andP;  To makeeffective decisions, executives need explanations and analysis information.andO;For example, there may be pertinent background information on a manufacturingproblem that is not portrayed by graphs or charts.andP;  The EIS must have a wayto tie soft data to the hard facts.andM;* Standards and Procedures.andP;  The EIS database should become the single sourceof information for executives so that they no longer receive conflictingreports based on different sets of data.andP;  When properly implemented, the EISenforces a standard view of information where, for example, each executivesees the same departmental head-count charts with data taken directly fromoperational systems.andM;* The information portrayed by the EIS must be of a high quality or it is ofno use.andP;  So, the data must be accurate, timely, comprehensive and useful.andO;Mechanisms must be built into the system to ensure these attributes.andM;* Responsiveness.andP;  Many IS projects take too long to develop.andP;  Businessproblems are often short-lived moving targets.andP;  EIS development must be fastenough to deliver an application while it is still useful.andP;  Unliketraditional IS projects, where development is measured in man-months, EISapplications have to be built in a few weeks or even days.andM;* Benefits.andP;  The bottom line on EIS is truly the fiscal bottom line.andP;  Tosimply make data more accessible is not the goal.andP;  Data are alreadyaccessible in a plethora of reports.andP;  Nor is the goal to enable executives toread reports faster.andP;  The system must produce dollar benefits that arereflected in financial statements.andM;Ultimately, there were two fundamental goals for our EIS: make the systemsimple enough so the executives can use their machines, and convert the costperformance reports from paper to electronic display so that executives haveto use their machines.andM;Before EIS, only two of the 14 executives at NAA had office computers.andP;  Thesetwo used them mostly for limited inquiry transactions and to request reports.andO;Persuading more of the executives to accept the PCs was a challenge thatrequired some salesmanship.andP;  The conversion for some has been, and continuesto be, a slow process.andM;In April 1989, we began to prototype our EIS by experimenting with technologyalready available in the department, such as PC graphics, mouse drivers andpop-up menus.andP;  Using these tools, we developed a crude prototype of thewritten cost performance briefing on a PC.andP;  When we showed it to theexecutives, we learned two important lessons.andP;  First, they wanted moregraphics and fewer numbers.andP;  And second, what they had in mind was access tofar more information than what was in the cost performance reports.andM;The Right PrototypeandM;We found a sophisticated prototype package, called RediMaster, by AmericanInformation Systems Inc. of Wellsboro, Pa.andP;  This program allowed us to doaway with pop-up menus and introduce a more flexible graphical userinterface.andP;  One of the important features of the interface is &quot;hot buttons.&quot;andO;A hot button is an area of the screen that accepts input from a mouse.andP;  UsingRediMaster, we created another version of the cost performance briefing andlearned that we were getting closer to what the executives wanted in terms ofpresentation and ease of use.andM;At this point, creating a strictly PC-based EIS posed some developmental andlogistical challenges.andP;  How could we distribute growing mountains of data tothe workstations and make sure they were always current?andP;  How could weprotect the data once they get to the PC?andP;  To be acceptable, the EIS had toconform not only to executive needs but to sound IS standards.andM;Addressing IS NeedsandM;From what we learned from the proto-types and discussions with executives, weestablished a set of requirements for choosing an appropriate EIS technologyfrom an IS point of view.andP;  These requirements addressed the needs forsecurity, capacity for growth, data integrity, connectivity and lowmaintenance.andM;Security of information is important to any business.andP;  To an aerospacemanufacturing and government contractor, it is critical.andP;  Our EIS technologyhad to provide for protecting executive information.andM;To be viable over the long term, any EIS must also be able to grow.andP;  In thebeginning, we figured our EIS database would be small.andP;  However, we realizedthat it potentially could grow to hundreds of megabytes in order to supportthe drill-down and ad hoc features.andP;  There is no simple way to predict growthunless the number, type and size of applications can be predicted.andP;  Becauseof the potential for explosive growth, the technology must be able to supportany conceivable growth pattern without significantly increasing theoperations and maintenance burdens of the IS staff.andM;A key to having accurate information in the system is data integrity.andP;  Thisincludes mechanisms for ensuring that data cannot be accidentally orintentionally tampered with or that data cannot be lost.andM;Connectivity refers to users' ability to access all of the functions and datathey need at their workstations, regardless of where they may reside.andP;  Thetotal executive network at NAA was designed to include a local area networkand gateways to the corporate IBM wide area network and externalcommunications resources.andP;  WE knew the EIS would have to dovetail into thisemerging environment.andM;Perhaps the strongest concern that faced IS management was the fear of havingto supply a cast of thousands to support the EIS without a budget increaseand without any relaxation in our service to other customers.andP;  The EIStechnology had to be such that maintenance would be kept to a manageablelevel.andP;  In addition, it had to promote EIS application design that could berelatively immune to on-going changes in the environment.andM;Armed with these requirements, we began the search for the right EISsoftware.andP;  Like almost all requests to buy something, this one had stringsattached.andP;  There were two primary constraints that affected our ultimatedecision.andP;  First, we did not have a blank check.andP;  and, second, we had aschedule to follow.andP;  We wanted the EIS technology in place with some visibleresults by the time the executives had their office computers.andM;Software SelectionandM;Shopping for vendors was the first order of business.andP;  For the most part, thevendors found us once word got out that we were looking at EISS.andP;  The threemain players in the EIS marketplace and their products are Boston-based PilotExecutive Software with Command Center and Advantage/G; Comshare Inc. in AnnArbor, Mich., with Commander; and Austin, Texas-based Execucom Systems Corp.,andO;with Executive Edge.andP;  Other entries include the newly announced OfficeVisionfrom IBM, DECDecisions from Digital, and EISEL by Interactive Images Inc. ofWoburn, Mass.andM;Having identified potential products, we began comparing and testing them.andO;During product demonstrations, we tried to evaluate the products from theperspectives of both executives and programmers.andP;  We paid close attention towhat kind of graphic displays were produced and how the user interfacesoperated.andP;  Then we viewed technical demonstrations of the products.andP;  Thefocus here was on the development tools and how the data for the system wereorganized and stored.andM;Part of the evaluation phase involved talking to users.andP;  We first talked toanother aerospace company that had built its own EIS.andP;  We then saw a workingversion of Execucom's EIS system implemented by a local utility company.andP;  Weinterviewed and heard presentations by IS personnel in banking industry andmanufacturing using Pilot's Command Center.andP;  Finally, we met various vendorsand users by attending the EIS '89 national seminar.andM;The product we finally chose was Pilot's Command Center, supplemented by theAdvantage/G application generator.andP;  The primary deciding factors in Pilot'sfavor were its mainframe-based architecture, IBM compatibility, data drivenapproach and powerful development tools.andM;Command Center consists of a mainframe engine for handling databasemaintenance and queries coupled with a PC front-end module for displayinggraphics.andP;  Being mainframe-based offered advantages in data security,unlimited capacity for database growth and EIS access by virtually anydivision user with the PC front-end software.andP;  This final point is importantbecause we believe that interest in the system will filter down through theexecutive ranks.andM;Our satisfaction should not imply that there are no disadvantages to amainframe package.andP;  WE have found response time to be generally slower on amainframe than on a dedicated PC.andP;  Having a mainframe database also meanssacrificing some flexibility in that the EIS does not easily accept filesfrom outside sources.andP;  In addition, it won't capture and display graphicimages generated by other systems, unlike certain PC-based systems.andP;  However,we felt the integrity, security and accessibility of a mainframe systemoutweighed the drawback of inflexibility.andM;The saga of EIS at North American Aircraft so far has been a happy one.andP;  Wecompleted the evaluation at the end of June 1989.andP;  We brought Command Centerin on a trial basis in August and tested it.andP;  We recommended acquisition andput a development team together to start training programmers in the CommandCenter language.andP;  The executives moved to their new offices, the PCs wereinstalled and we demonstrated several prototype EIS applications by November1.andM;We are now in the middle of full-scale development of EIS applications.andP;  In asubsequent article, we will explore the evolution of the development team andthe organizational infrastructure surrounding the EIS.andP;  We will also describethe methodology we use to define and create the applications.andP;  And we willshare some of the important results of this effort and some of the lessonslearned.andM;David A.
