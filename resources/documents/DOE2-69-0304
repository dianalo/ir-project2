An eight-year research campaign on the role of photooxidantsand other chemicals in the atmosphere is being done under the Eurotracprogramme established in June 1988 by the European Community (Brussels),the European Free Trade Association (Geneva) and the Council for MutualEconomic Assistance. An international conference held in Toronto alsoin June 1988 called for a 20% reduction in CO{sub 2} emissions by 2005.A mean temperature rise of 4.5 degrees C would have a number of effectson sealevel, forests, agriculture and power demand. Recommendations toreduce CO{sub 2} and other emissions include eliminating CFC production,increasing natural gas consumption, reducing deforestation in tropicalregions and increasing nuclear power generation. More information isexpected shortly from an EPA study. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
