Seventeen women and four men were sent into a pool ofprospective jurors in the first day of jury selection Monday. Onlysix people were disqualified, largely because they had too muchfamiliarity with the Iran-Contra scandal.   At North's trial last year, it took more than a week to select ajury, primarily because so many prospective jurors had been exposedto North's televised testimony to Congress in which the formerWhite House aide admitted many of the activities that eventuallyled to criminal charges against him.   Like North, Poindexter gave public testimony to Congress under agrant of immunity, but some prospective jurors could not recognizehim in the courtroom Monday.   ``He's the handsome man here with the glasses and moustache,''defense attorney Richard Beckler told a potential juror at onepoint, beckoning toward his client seated across the room.   U.S. District Judge Harold Greene took care of the problem ofexposure to Poindexter's immunized testimony before jury selectionbegan. The judge excused 76 potential jurors who said on aquestionnaire that they had been exposed to Poindexter's testimony.   Those 76 came from a total of 206 potential jurors. In the Northcase, all but 16 of the first 54 potential jurors indicated theyhad some familiarity with North's testimony on Capitol Hill.   Twelve jurors and six alternates will be drawn for thePoindexter trial from a pool of at least 40.   Greene included in the jury pool a former Bush campaign aide whoyears ago had been babysat by one of Poindexter's attorneys.   ``Just because counsel babysat for her doesn't cast any doubt onher,'' the judge said.   Among the six who were disqualified was a Food and DrugAdministration employee who said he had heard that North'ssecretary, Fawn Hall, shredded documents in the scandal. Hall isexpected to testify at Poindexter's trial.   ``If someone is shredding documents, they don't want me to knowabout it,'' said the man. ``If they don't want me to know about it,I want to know why they are shredding.''   Others sent into the jury pool include a postal employee whorecalled Poindexter's name from North's trial last year; a retiredpolice officer who said he would treat former President Reagan'stestimony the same as that of any other witness; and a registerednurse who said she understood Poindexter had been indicted oncharges of defrauding the government in connection with arms sales.   Poindexter actually is under indictment on charges ofconspiracy, two counts of obstructing Congress and two counts ofmaking false statements. The charges relate to Poindexter's allegedcoverup of North's secret resupply network to the Contra rebels inNicaragua and to Poindexter's alleged lies concerning a November1985 shipment of Hawk anti-aircraft missiles to Iran.   Reagan gave videotaped testimony for Poindexter's trial Feb.16-17 and Poindexter's lawyers are expected to replay it in court.</TEXT></DOC>
