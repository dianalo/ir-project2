In a leveraged buyout offer, the unit's senior management and Clayton andamp; Dubilier Inc., a New York-based investment firm, have agreed to acquire the unit for about $240 million.    In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by borrowing. Ultimately, the debt is paid with funds generated by the acquired company's operations or sale of its assets.    The plastics, automotive-parts and protective-services concern last year said it planned to sell the division as part of an effort to restructure the company, and to split profit evenly between manufacturing and service businesses. With the sale of the industrial-products unit, about 69% of Borg-Warner's earnings will come from manufacturing and 31% from services.    As reported earlier, Borg-Warner will use proceeds from the sale for acquisitions to expand its core business and to buy back as many as 15 million of its 86.7 million common shares outstanding.    Separately, a Borg-Warner spokeswoman said the company doesn't expect to sell its financial services unit in the first quarter, as it originally had hoped. &quot;We're still committed to the sale, providing we can get full value for it,&quot; she said. Analysts have estimated it could fetch about $600 million.    Also, Borg-Warner remains mum on Minstar Inc.'s bid for the company. But a source close to Borg-Warner said the company or its representatives had planned to meet with Minstar Chairman Irwin Jacobs or his representatives since Borg-Warner's board meeting last month. The source couldn't confirm that any meeting had taken place. The company declined comment.    Minstar, Minneapolis, is a leisure products and investing concern through which Mr. Jacobs frequently pursues takeover targets.    Last month, Minstar and Mr. Jacobs slightly raised their minimum bid for Borg-Warner to $44 a share, or $3.29 billion, for the 87.6% of the company they don't already own. Mr. Jacobs threatened to make a hostile tender offer if Borg-Warner continues to ignore them. </TEXT></DOC>
