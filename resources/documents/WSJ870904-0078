The temporary rules, which will be published in today's Federal Register, carry out provisions of last year's tax overhaul that are designed to prevent parents from reducing their tax liability by switching income-producing assets to children. The regulations affect children who have at least one living parent and who realize at least $1,000 of unearned income during the tax year.    The provisions are estimated to raise about $1.05 billion over five years.    The higher tax rate doesn't apply to earned income, such as money received for babysitting or mowing a lawn. But it does apply to such items as interest income and gifts from people outside the family, as well as from parents.    Moreover, although the tax law's provisions take effect with the 1987 tax year, the higher rate may apply to income that results from assets transferred to the child before 1987. In addition, Social Security and pension payments to a child are included to the extent they are part of a child's adjusted gross income.    The IRS is seeking comments on these &quot;kiddie-tax&quot; rules before issuing final regulations. Among other things, it specifically asked for suggestions on whether special &quot;hardship&quot; rules are needed for children who have difficulty getting tax information from their parents in time to file their own returns on time.    For children who have unearned income above $1,000, the proposed rules explain how to arrive at net unearned income. First, children can take all of their unearned income and reduce it by $500. This amount applies in 1987 and 1988; after that, it will be adjusted for inflation.    Then the remaining unearned income can be reduced in two ways. In 1987 and 1988, children can apply $500 of the standard deduction or $500 of itemized deductions. Alternatively, they can apply the deductions that are directly allocated to producing the unearned income. They can use whichever method results in less income remaining.    Whatever amount does remain is considered net unearned income and is subject to tax at the parents' higher marginal rate. The tax imposed on this income can't be less than the tax that would be imposed if this income were added to the parent's taxable income.    The agency also explains how to deal with trust income and adjustments to parents' taxable income. </TEXT></DOC>
