Unfortunately, besides comparingapples and oranges without explaining how little the comparison meant, thechart isn't even correct as far as the numbers go.andP;  Just as an example, theMacintosh Classic is listed with a $1,000 current price, certainly closeenough to the $995 list price of the 1 MB entry level model, but the maximummemory is listed as 2 MB and this is the figure divided into the price to getthe price per byte, resulting in a price that is exactly half the correctprice per byte for the Macintosh Classic.andM;The same chart also shows that the new PDP-11/93 has a maximum memory of only1 MB and therefore its cost per byte is much higher than the MacintoshClassic; again, setting aside the fact that this comparison is virtuallymeaningless, it will come as some surprise to Digital Equipment and itscustomers that the maximum memory in a PDP-11/93 is only 1 MB, especiallywhen the least amount of memory in the base system is 2 MB.andM;Another item not factored into the far-too-simplistic cost per byte numberpublished in the Times piece is the 205 MB hard disk included in thePDP-11/93's $14,175 base price.andP;  Of course, the base Macintosh Classic is afloppy-only system.andM;The net result is that, of the only two modern computers compared in thechart, the actual cost per byte for the Macintosh is twice what is shown,while the true cost per byte for the PDP-11/93 is half what is shown.andP;  Infact, if you use the correct numbers, then what looks in the chart to be awide discrepancy in the cost of the computers is far less.andM;According to the NYT chart, the PDP's cost per byte is 20 times that of theMac Classic, while it is actually only 7 times greater.andM;Pretty sloppy reporting, and just another example of the whiz- bang numbersgames often played by the portion of the media that doesn't understandcomputers and really couldn't care less.andM;I am not specifically criticizing either the authors of this piece or hiseditors because I don't know whom is at fault here, but someone certainly isresponsible for this.andP;  Who do they think their readers are? Either thearticle is intended for people who don't really understand the computerbusiness, in which case it is either very misleading or more likely justplain confusing, or it is for computer experts who would immediately see thefallacy of comparing computers on that basis.andM;The only thing this chart really tells us is that someone didn't care enoughto get some elementary facts right and that any other computer-related storyin the NYT must be viewed with considerable skepticism.andM;We all make mistakes, but this goes beyond the sort of mistake that we shouldaccept from this prominent a source of information.andM;I think it is long past time when the media giants start to realize thatcomputers are among the most important tools for making money and changingour lives and respond to that realization by assigning reporters to thestories who know what they are doing.andM;Sure, once upon a time Time magazine named the personal computer &quot;Person ofthe Year,&quot; but the quality of computer reporting in the non-specialized mediahas seen little improvement since then.andP;  It reminds me very much of the timewhen business reporting wasn't considered of sufficient interest for TVnetworks or most newspapers to have a reporter with expertise in the fieldcover those stories.andM;The other winner was ABC's Business Week, a Sunday morning business magazineanchored by Sander Vanocur.andP;  I want to say at the outset that I respect muchof Mr. Vanocur's work and this isn't a personal attack, but someone at ABCmade some pretty obvious mistakes on a computer-related story, although,since it wasn't dealing with prices and the business performance of a majorcompany, it wasn't important in the same way as the NYT story.andM;Since this was a throwaway Christmas story or because it was an interestingstory about soldiers caught up in the Gulf crisis, perhaps no one felt it wasimportant to fact-check, but watching the report I felt the same sense ofdisgust for careless mistakes that I always feel when a science fiction TVshow or movie lacks consistency; someone who is being paid a professionalwage is not doing his/her homework.andM;The story was about mobile computerized PX stores where U.S.andP;  militarypersonnel in Saudi Arabia could order Christmas presents.andP;  Fine - it was anice story and it was good to see the troops being taken care of.andM;Unfortunately, as the screen showed images of soldiers having their orderspunched into minicomputer-style keyboards and reading data off IBM monitors,Sander Vanocur was saying that the orders are taken down on laptop computers.andM;Perhaps a laptop computer was hidden somewhere under the table, but itcertainly looked to my somewhat experienced eye as if they were usingnetworked workstations or terminals to take the orders.andP;  Did someone forgetto tell Mr. Vanocur that a laptop is a tiny self-contained computer and thatthe keyboards shown were themselves about twice the size of a typical laptop?andM;Or perhaps the wrong shot was used and the PXs really are using laptops inmost of the mobile PXs, but if so no one involved in reporting the storyseemed to think it important enough to point out that despite the fact thatthey were talking about one kind of computer they were showing something elseentirely.andM;Sure, it isn't an earth-shattering mistake to refer to a networkedworkstation as a laptop computer, but if you are going to report on storiesinvolving computers you should know what one looks like.andP;  If no one knew whatthe pictures showed why didn't they just leave out the comment about laptops?andM;The worst part of this is that when I see such obvious mistakes I always askmyself, &quot;If they can't even get this right, how many mistakes are they makingin the other news reports, mistakes I am not in a position to spot?&quot;andM;This story shows the sort of media sloppiness that has no place in reportsconcerning high-technology.andP;  After all, would sports fans long accept asportscaster who didn't know the most glaring differences between Australianrules football, American football, and rugby?andM;Mr.andP;  Vanocur is definitely NOT one of the infamous &quot;pretty boy&quot; airheadssometimes hired to present the news on television; he is a real reporter, andhe of all people should know better.andM;I don't expect any reporter to know everything, but I do expect aprofessional to realize that he may be making himself look silly to millionsof knowledgeable viewers simply because of an easy- to-check fact.andP;  He didn'tneed to call the Pentagon to learn if those images were of laptop computers;probably the young studio gofer (as in go-fer this, go-fer that) who wasprobably working on the set could have described a laptop computer.andO;Certainly someone there must have known what they look like.andP;  Or perhaps thismistake resulted with the editor who may have chosen the images incorrectly,to accompany the copy.andM;If this had happened outside the news segment on one of the morningcoffee-klatsch talk shows, then I wouldn't have given it a second thought,but this was on ABC's weekly business program and computers are a veryimportant part of today's business.andM;I think that the main reason there are so many computer magazines andnewspapers is the terrible job that the regular press and even the businesspress does of covering most computer stories.andM;If America expects to remain an economic and technological force in theworld, this will have to change, and it won't change until as much emphasisis placed on accurately reporting computer and high-technology stories as iscurrently placed on having baseball and football reported by people who knowsomething about the games.andM;I just hope we don't have to wait until the next generation of journalismstudents, the ones trained to take notes on laptop computers, finally getanchor and senior editor positions.andM;(John McCormick/19901221)</TEXT></DOC>
