The Sierra Club and National Wildlife Federation havedenounced its members as the moral equivalent of outlaws. Aformer U.S. interior secretary has described the organizatonas &quot;a bunch of kooks.&quot; By police reckoning it is an extremistand even violent group whose idea of saving the planetincludes spiking trees to make logging hazardous, anddestroying power lines and road-building equipment.</LP><TEXT>   But would the group go as far as to plant bombs? TheFederal Bureau of Investigation and other law-enforcementauthorities are expected to offer their views about thisquestion on Friday, when they give the results of aninvestigation of a pipe-bomb explosion that injured two EarthFirst] members here last month. The question: Did someone tryto kill them, or are they merely incompetent bomb makers?   The investigation has put the controversial organizationinto the limelight. Earth First] claims to be a kind ofconfederacy of perhaps 5,000 &quot;eco-warriors.&quot; Its founding wasinspired 10 years ago by the late Edward Abbey's novel &quot;TheMonkey Wrench Gang.&quot; The 1975 book romanticizedenvironmentalists who fictionally liberated the deserts bydestroying billboards, roads and bulldozers while plotting tofree the Colorado River by blowing up the Glen Canyon Dam. In1981, Earth First] draped a 300-foot banner, painted toresemble a crack, over the dam. The authorities weren'tamused.   In 1983, Dave Foreman, an Earth First] founder, lay on alogging road in Oregon and wouldn't yield to a pickup drivenby a lumberjack. The driver kept going, and dragged Mr.Foreman, clutching the pickup's front bumper, for a hundredyards. Within the past year, Earth Firsters have chainedthemselves to road-building machinery in Arizona to block atelescope project that endangers a rare mountain squirrel,created &quot;human blockades&quot; of logging roads in Australia, andsat for days in the tops of Northern California redwood treesattempting to keep them from being felled.   In Arizona, federal authorities last year arrested threeEarth First] activists, charging that they had used cuttingtorches to destroy power lines in a field test of a granderscheme aimed at disabling nuclear power plants in Arizona andCalifornia. Mr. Foreman, though he wasn't arrested at thescene, was charged with conspiracy for allegedly helping planthe scheme. All have denied the charges and rejectedgovernment offers to plea-bargain.   Earth First] insists that it is peaceful. &quot;We believe inconfrontation, yes, but violence, no,&quot; says Mike Roselle, afounder. He says Earth First] people are the targets, not theinstigators, of violence.   Indeed, the car bombing on May 24 injured two Earth First]leaders -- Judi Bari, a 40-year-old mother of two, and DarrylCherney, a 33-year-old musician. They were driving through aquiet Oakland neighborhood when a pipe bomb in the backseatof Ms. Bari's Subaru exploded.   She was seriously injured; Mr. Cherney suffered a gashover the eye. Oakland police, however, whisked the two intocustody -- Ms. Bari to the hospital, where she is recovering,Mr. Cherney into jail -- on suspicion of transporting thebomb for some terrorist purpose. After a flurry of statementsindicating the two would quickly be charged, police backeddown and asked for more time. Mr. Cherney was released fromjail.   The activists insist they were targeted for death, perhapsby greedy timber or other commercial interests, or byright-wing off-road-vehicle ideologues angry over EarthFirst] efforts to keep vehicles out of Western deserts. Theysay that in recent months they have received at least 50death threats.   On Friday, the FBI and other authorities are scheduled toput up or shut up. They are to announce the results of theirinvestigation, dealing among other things with whether thepair was involved in the bombing of a Cloverdale, Calif.,sawmill in early May.   The evidence already disclosed in the Oakland car bombingseems circumstancial, if damaging: The bomb appears to havebeen lying unconcealed on the car seat when it exploded, forexample, and nails used to assemble it seem similar to nailsfound elsewhere in the car.   &quot;Ridiculous]&quot; Mr. Cherney says of the authorities'suspicions. &quot;We were a band on the way to a gig.&quot; A formerEnglish teacher in Brooklyn as well as a musician, he managesa grim joke: &quot;We now call ourselves the Exploding Subarus.&quot;But he adds in deadly seriousness: &quot;Somebody tried to killus.&quot;   Their friends and supporters shudder to think otherwise.&quot;If they {Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari} did this, it's all over,&quot;says a friend of Ms. Bari. &quot;It will be devastating to thecause.&quot;   Many of the death threats appear related to Earth First]efforts to organize a summer-long demonstration againstNorthern California timber companies that are clear-cuttingthe last of the state's privately owned virgin redwoodforests. The protest has stirred deep hostility in theredwood corridors of Mendocino and Humboldt Counties. The twoactivists have said that when the bomb exploded they wereheaded for a musical fund-raiser -- he is a vocalist andguitarist, she a fiddler -- for their &quot;Redwood Summer&quot;project.   With help from another militant environmental group,Greenpeace, Earth First] has hired a detective to investigatethe bombing. Earth First] has a list of suspects, includingdisgruntled loggers and the police themselves. Another is the&quot;Committee for the Death of Earth First,&quot; which is thesignature on recent anonymous letters threatening to &quot;huntdown&quot; Earth First] women.   The FBI still considers Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari assuspects. But, says Duke Diedrich, a spokesman for the bureauin San Francisco, &quot;We haven't ruled out any possibility andour investigation is very widespread.&quot;   Earth First] has no faith in the bureau. Mr. Foreman hasobtained FBI wiretap transcripts in which an undercover agentis heard telling other agents that the real importance ofarresting Mr. Foreman is &quot;to send a message&quot; to militantenvironmentalists, adding, &quot;That's all we're really doing.&quot;Later, realizing his microphone is still on, the agent says,&quot;We don't need that on tape. Hoo boy]&quot;   While the FBI denies trying to unfairly discredit EarthFirst], Mr. Foreman's lawyer, Garry Spence (who alsorepresents Imelda Marcos in her federal racketeering trial)promises to make the agent's &quot;message&quot; the central issue inMr. Foreman's trial on charges of destroying power lines,scheduled for September.   Friends of Mr. Cherney and Ms. Bari say they can't believethat either is capable of building or exploding a bomb.   Mr. Cherney says his childhood friends know he wassomething of a &quot;chicken,&quot; deathly afraid of firecrackers.Friends describe Ms. Bari, who couldn't be interviewed in thehospital for this story, as a union organizer and&quot;hell-raiser,&quot; but one with a self-deprecating sense of humorwhose credo is nonviolence. Oakland police have produced aphotograph of her with a submachine gun, but Mr. Cherney saysit was taken as a prank for the cover of a satirical recordalbum she and he recorded some time ago. It was titled, &quot;TheyDon't Make Hippies Like They Used To.&quot;   Mr. Cherney says Earth First] often lands in troublebecause it uses hyperbole and satire as a weapon and acatharsis. To write of pouring sand in the gasoline tank of abulldozer, he says, isn't the same as doing it -- even thoughit still pleases the writer and offends the authorities, hesays.   Some think this philosophy explains statements by Ms.Bari, who last March joined other Earth First] members inUkiah, Calif., in slipping past crowds to hang a sign on ahuge mechanical logger that read: &quot;This Thing Kills Jobs andForests.&quot; A few weeks later, the machine was destroyed by amysterious fire. Ms. Bari told the Earth First] Journal, theorganization's newsletter: &quot;Either this thing is a $700,000lemon, or there are some heroic people out there in thewoods.&quot;   Did Ms. Bari have anything to do with the fire? &quot;It wasn'tme,&quot; she said. &quot;I was home in bed with five witnesses.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
