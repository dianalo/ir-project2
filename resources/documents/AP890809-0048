E. Robert Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer, was convicted Tuesdayof illegally receiving $425,000 from Wedtech to influence Meese andother government officials in the company's bid for governmentcontracts.   A jury acquitted Wallach, 55, of a second racketeeringconspiracy charge stemming from another $100,000 he was accused oftaking from the company.   The three-month trial in Manhattan federal court was the sixthto result from the scandal at Wedtech, a defense contractor thatclosed after allegations of illegal activity were made public.   After the verdict, Wallach said he was a victim of``prosecutorial contortions of the facts'' and would appeal.   ``I am guilty of nothing but being in the wrong place and thewrong time,'' he said.   Two co-defendants, one of whom also was linked to Meese, wereconvicted of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy and fraud.   Meese, who never was charged in the Wedtech scandal, testifiedthat Wallach had never asked him to do anything improper forWedtech.   Wallach defended Meese, telling reporters: ``Nothing thathappened here casts a single aspersion on that man.''   The former attorney general was en route to West Point, N.Y.,Tuesday night to give a speech at the U.S. Military Academy and wasunavailable for comment.   Wedtech, once a small machine shop in the Bronx, grew into a$100 million government contractor through a federal program thatset aside contracts for minority-controlled companies. Evidence atearlier trials showed that Wedtech continued to get the no-bidcontracts through bribe schemes even after it ceased to be aminority-owned company.   The announcement of the verdict was interrupted for about 20minutes when the mother of one of the defendants, R. Kent London,was overcome with emotion and had trouble breathing. Oxygen wasbrought to the courtroom for the woman, who lawyers said has hadtwo heart attacks previously.   The defendants were variously charged in a 21-count indictmentwith six separate schemes to defraud Wedtech or the governmentthrough false documents and bribery.   Wallach, a San Francisco lawyer who represented Meese during hisconfirmation hearings for attorney general and at a specialprosecutor's investigation in 1984, was convicted of two acts ofracketeering.   One was defrauding Wedtech in September 1983 for $125,000 whichhe billed as work for the company's public stock offering but whichprosecutors said was for his efforts to influence Meese and othersto get an Army contract for Wedtech.   In the other act, Wallach was found to have illegally received$300,000 from Wedtech officials, purportedly for helping thecompany acquire shipyards and a tug-barge system. The money wasactually in anticipation of Wallach's employment at the JusticeDepartment where he could influence Meese and others, the juryfound.   Wallach also was convicted of one charge of conspiracy todefraud the government and two fraud charges stemming from thepayments.   He was acquitted of conspiring with W. Franklyn Chinn and Londonto defraud Wedtech of $100,000 by covering up the payment toWallach. Chinn, Meese's former financial adviser, and London, abusiness associate of Chinn, were convicted of that charge, amongothers.   Wallach faces up to 45 years in prison. Chinn and London couldget up to 40 years on their two racketeering convictions and lessersentences on the other charges.   All three men also face fines and forfeitures when they aresentenced Oct. 16.   Four former Wedtech executives, including the company's formerchairman, pleaded guilty to bribe- and theft-related charges inJanuary 1987 and have testified at several trials, including a casethat resulted in the conviction of former Rep. Mario Biaggi,D-N.Y., on racketeering charges.   Rep. Robert Garcia, D-N.Y., is awaiting trial on charges that heextorted $185,000 in cash and a diamond and emerald necklace fromWedtech.</TEXT></DOC>
