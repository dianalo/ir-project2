Walters, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, spoke toreporters before flying to Oman, the fifth stop on a tour that alsohas taken him to Israel, Syria and Iraq.   Omani officials would not comment on the purpose of the visit,saying only that it would last two days and they would discussU.N.-related issues.   In Kuwait, the ambassador praised the government's refusal tofree convicted terrorists despite pressures that included thehijacking of a Kuwait Airways jumbo jet and the killing of twopassengers.   The release of 17 jailed terrorists convicted of bombing theU.S. and French embassies in 1983 was the hijackers' only demandduring the 16-day hijack last month. Kuwait refused to free themand the hijackers surrendered the plane in Algiers in return forsafe conduct.   Release of the 17 also has been the main demand of pro-IranianShiite Mosleh`fxtremists holding nine American hostages in Lebanon.   Walters met with Kuwait's emir, Sheik Jaber Ahmed Sabah; CrownPrince Saad Abdullah Sabah, and Rashed Abdel-Aziz Rashed, ministerof state for Cabinet affairs.   Asked whether he and the Kuwaitis discussed the hijacking andseveral terrorist bombings in the sheikdom, he said: ``The UnitedStates thinks that the Kuwaiti government demonstrated greatcourage during the recent hijacking.   ``We are not here to make a deal about terrorists and in no waywill the United States ever bring any kind of pressure on theKuwaiti government,'' he said in reference to the hostages inLebanon.   Asked about Security Council measure of last July 20 calling fora truce in the Iran-Iraq war, which began in SeptMm|er 1980,Walters said Resolution 598 was ``unanimously approved and it'sbinding on every member of the United Nations.''   ``The United States will never abandon its support of 598 andwill work ... and urge our friends to support a second resolutionand an arms embargo on Iran'' if it does not accept the resolution,he said.   Iraq has said it will accept the resolution, but only if Irandoes.   Iran says Iraq must be declared the aggressor before there canbe a cease-fire. Iraq invaded Iran in September 1980 after severalborder skirmishes.</TEXT></DOC>
