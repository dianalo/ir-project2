Inc. is in the business of death.   Lethal injection machines, electric chairs, gallows and gaschambers form the catalog of equipment designed and built by thecompany owned by a Boston entrepreneur, his wife and an engineer.   American Engineering is believed to be the only company in theUnited States that makes nothing but execution equipment. Fouryears ago, it designed and built the first computer-controlledmachine to regulate the flow of drugs in a lethal injection.   Five states have bought the $30,000 device, company PresidentNorbert C. Lynch said.   ``This is the most humane way we know of today to carry outlethal injection,'' Lynch said. ``If they're going to carry it out,they should do it in the most humane possible way.''   However, none of American Engineering's equipment has been usedin any of the 100 executions in the United States since 1976.   Lynch runs American Engineering and a financial consulting firmfrom a storefront in the city's Charlestown neighborhood, down theblock from the Bunker Hill Monument.   In 1983, Lynch said, an engineer friend heard a disc jockeymocking New Jersey because it advertised for executioners. The ideawas planted: how to automate lethal injection.   ``The methodology that's used in the lethal injection on amanual system is barbaric,'' Lynch said.   The basic complications in lethal injection, Lynch said, areruptured veins, inaccurate dosages and failure to immediatelyinduce unconsciousness.   Of the 37 states which have capital punishment, 16 prescribedeath by lethal injection.   Delaware contracted for a lethal injection machine last yearafter the state changed its method of execution from hanging, saidH. Brooke Laggner, chief of administration and operational supportfor the state's Department of Correction.   ``It takes away the element that you don't have any Hippocraticoath problems because all you need is someone to set up an i.v.,''Laggner said, referring to the potential conflict of using medicalskills to cause death.   Delaware, which has six prisoners under death sentence but hashad no executions since the 1976 Supreme Court ruling, paid $60,000for the injection equipment and an execution trailer also designedby American Engineering.   Death penalty opponents bristle at American Engineering'sbusiness, saying there is no ethical justification in makingexecutions easier or more efficient.   ``The worst sin of all is to do that well which shouldn't bedone at all,'' said Henry Schwarzschild, director of the AmericanCivil Liberties Union's capital punishment project. ``The notionthat a homicide becomes nicer if you do it nicely is morallyoutrageous.''   The injection machine, a 3-by-4-foot gray box with a row ofswitches and red lights, is mounted to the wall above the inmate'sgurney. Five to 6 feet of intravenous tubing inserted by a medicaltechnician into the inmate's right arm run through the wall to acomputerized control module.   Two executioners each push a button to start the machine;neither knows who actually activates the pistons that inject 10 to15 cubic centimeters of drugs.   A dosage of sodium pentathol renders the inmate unconscious. Thesecond drug is pancuronium bromide, or Pavulon, which in largedoses paralyzes body functions. The third, potassium chloride,stops the heart.   The execution should take four to six minutes, Lynch said, ``asopposed to 25 minutes to a half an hour.''   ``The prisoner is going to be sedated first. While he is underwe are going to cause respiratory arrest, leading to brain death,''he said. ``Is he going to feel it? No. He's going to go out andthat's the end of it. Over and out.''   American Engineering has assets of about $100,000 and the marketfor its wares is limited, but Lynch feels the condition of thenation's execution devices and the lack of competition could meanmore contracts.   For states that don't use lethal injection, American Engineeringalso designs electric chairs, gas chambers and gallows.   Lynch said he has sold three electric helmets at $5,000 apieceand three sets of leg stocks at $2,000 each, and redesigned onegallows for $15,000. Citing the confidentiality of his clients,Lynch refused to identify the states does business with.   Gas chambers inspected by the company would leak if used, Lynchclaimed. American Engineering is rebuilding one at a cost of$200,000. The company also has repaired four electric chairs andcondemned two others, but he said the states refused to renovate orreplace the devices.   Lynch said he opposes capital punishment, but adds: ``If it'sgoing to be done it should be done right.''   ``If we're going to hang this person then we should be using theproper rope,'' Lynch said. ``And you can't blame the rope-maker forthe hanging.''</TEXT><HEAD>Adv for Sunday, June 19</HEAD></DOC>
