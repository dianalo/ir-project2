However, industry analysts held out little expectation OPEC wouldreach agreement, a sentiment echoed by U.S. oil company executivesgathered Monday at the annual meeting of the American PetroleumInstitute in New York.   ``It might take more than one or two meetings to achieve'' higherprices by limiting production, said Richard M. Morrow, chairman ofAmoco Corp.   The 13-member Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries isunder intense pressure to come up with a new production agreement toregain some control over the chaotic market.   ``The alternative is for the conference to collapse in a heap,''said London oil consultant Paul McDonald.   Two of the cartel's committees plan joint discussions startingThursday in Vienna, Austria. All 13 ministers are scheduled to meetnext Monday for their regular winter meeting.   Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members have turned up theirproduction levels in recent months as they compete for marketposition in advance of the meetings.   The increased output has added more crude to an already gluttedmarket, pushing prices $4 or more below OPEC's benchmark price of$18 per 42-gallon barrel.   Each $1 drop in the price of crude oil theoretically means a fallof 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices. However, U.S. oilcompanies have not passed on to consumers the current price declinepartly because of the tight supplies of gasoline coupled with highdemand.   If the OPEC ministers succeeded in putting together a newproduction package, oil prices should rise some in the comingmonths, analysts said.   Failure, they said, could send prices into a nosedive.   ``If they come up with a convincing system, we could see pricesgo up a couple of dollars,'' said David Gray, an oil analyst at theLondon investment firm of James Capel and Co. If not, ``prices couldbe below $10 quite quickly.''   Charles J. DiBona, president of the American Petroleum Institute,the main trade group for the U.S. oil business, said, ``I amoptimistic that they will reach an agreement; the question is howsoon.''   The International Energy Agency estimated in its Monthly OilMarket Report that OPEC production soared to almost 21.1 millionbarrels a day in October, the highest monthly output for more thanfive years.   The cartel's current production quotas, stemming from a December1986 arrangement, are intended to limit total output to about 15million barrels a day. That excludes Iraq, which ignored its quota.   Several OPEC members have recommended that the cartel boost itsoutput ceiling to 17.4 million barrels, which would still require asharp overall cutback by the cartel.   The Vienna meeting's goals are to try to come up with new quotas,bring Iraq back into the system and stop the cheating by thecartel's members.</TEXT></DOC>
