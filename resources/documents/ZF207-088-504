 Vendors point out the number ofrespectable companies that buy used equipment, such as big-namebanks and universities.andP;  Banks often use older technology.andO;Vendors also point out that not everyone needs the latestequipment and they caution that buyers should first make sure thatnew equipment fits into the buyer's information management needs.andO;In addition, used equipment, which is familiar to systems managersand users, can cut down on costly training time.andP;

said Reg Rogers, account manager for El Camino Resourcesof Northridge, Calif.andP;  &quot;If your company has bought a used computer, then youmight think it wasn't doing well.&quot;andM;Rogers, a former DEC field engineer, laments that certain companies willinstall only state-of-the-art equipment.andP;  &quot;Everyone wants to have the new DECprocessor first,&quot; Rogers said.andP;  &quot;It's an ego thing and they get carried awaywith it.&quot;andM;This &quot;keeping up with the Joneses&quot; attitude, say Rogers and others, is whatmany used-equipment vendors consider their biggest challenge: convincingorganizations that used equipment is no less prestigious than buying new.andM;&quot;Just because something is two years old doesn't mean it's not going to dothe job for the company,&quot; said Nick Meek, vice president of Salem,Mass.-based Technology Procurement, doing business as SUSco, a subsidiary ofSecond User Systems, a British VAX reseller.andM;Big-Name PurchasersandM;To counter what they see as buyer elitism, used-equipment dealers are eagerto tell anyone who'll listen about the many benefits of buying used products.andM;Some start by pointing out that many perfectly respectable--and evenprestigious--organizations buy used equipment.andM;Big-name banks and universities are big buyers of used DEC systems, said JohnFrater, sales manager for Computer Clearing House of Rochester, N.Y.andM;And they are perfectly happy, Frater said.andP;  &quot;Banks tend to use oldertechnology,&quot; said James Claypoole, president of Boston-based used-equipmentdealer Bay State Computer Group.andP;  &quot;They keep buying 11/70s.&quot;andM;Claypoole proudly notes that among Bay State clients are several Wall Streetbrokerages and financial services institutions and large banks, as well asFortune 100 companies.andP;  Many banks use DEC machines as a front end to IBM&quot;number-crunching&quot; machines, he said.andM;Used-equipment dealers continue their pitch by noting that not everyone needsthe latest and shiniest hardware.andP;  although DEC rolls out new products everythree to six months, dealers say new offerings may not necessarily fit intothe buyer's information management needs.andM;&quot;A 6200 might not be obsolete in [DEC's] mind,&quot; El Camino's Rogers said,&quot;but, for certain companies, an 8000 processor is not obsolete, and theydon't want to got to a 6200.&quot;andP;  If a company runs an automated warehouse, forexample, and needs to add capacity to its VAX, an 11/750 may be the way togo, Rogers said.andM;Used-equipment dealers also argue that their equipment, which is familiar tosystems managers and users, cuts down on costly training time.andP;  &quot;[Machine]operators are used to them,&quot; Rogers said.andM;Reliability is another big sell.andP;  &quot;Ideally, when computers are up andrunning, with the electronics inside, they'll run forever.andP;  How can they gobad as long as you use good [brand] names,&quot; with good technical peoplerunning them, Rogers said.andM;Then there's the issue of availability.andP;  Bay State says it can deliver andinstall a used machine in a week to 10 days.andP;  In contrast, buying a newsystem from DEC can take six months from order placement to delivery andinstallation, according to Claypoole.andM;Claypoole proudly noted that, during the 1987 stock market crash, Bay Statewas able to ship equipment to brokerages and service organizations within 10days after their computers failed.andP;  Many of these brokerages use &quot;obsolete&quot;DEC machines to capture stock quote data, he added.andM;Despite their multipronged pitches, used-equipment dealers still lament thatmany are snobbish about buying previously owned equipment.andP;  They vow tocontinue battling the &quot;not-as-good-as-new&quot; attitude.andM;&quot;We must change that image,&quot; El Camino's Rogers said.andP;  &quot;It's a prestige thingto say I bought a new whatever.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
