Some 250 newprivate schools have opened since mid-1990 (of that, about100 are affiliated with the Catholic Church).   Private education was suppressed in Poland for the 45years of Communist rule. A few vocational schools and theCatholic University of Lublin survived, but everyone else wasforced into the cookie-cutter mold of state education. It'sno surprise that the Solidarity government liftedrestrictions on private schools in 1990. What is remarkableis that it also concluded that the hidebound educationalbureaucracy could be reformed only if it faced effectivecompetition from private schools.</LP><TEXT>   The government established an Office of Innovation andIndependent Schools, and appointed as its head a 30-year-oldactivist in Solidarity's educational underground namedKatarzyna Skorzynska. Ms. Skorzynska helped convince theParliament to pass a law giving civic organizations andindividuals the right to start private schools and bereimbursed for up to 50% of what it would have cost the stateto educate their students. The Solidarity-dominated Senatewanted a higher reimbursement but was blocked by thethen-Communist-dominated lower house.   On a recent visit to the U.S., Ms. Skorzynska told us theprogram has been a success. While only about 15,000 studentsnow attend the new, nonstate schools, the number is steadilygrowing. Many of their innovations have been picked up by thestate schools, some of which have been forced to fire pooradministrators or retrain poor teachers. Some public highschools have actually left the state system and becomeindependent. &quot;We have learned that competition isindispensable in providing quality education,&quot; Ms. Skorzynskasays.   Rather than seeing private schools as a threat to itsefforts, Poland's Education Ministry views its role as anhonest broker in encouraging excellence. Ministry officialsbelieve their job of reforming state education will be madeeasier by having non-state schools as a source of energy andvision. Some regional education officials have helped the newschools, even to the point of giving them surplus schoolequipment.   While she was pleased to meet with education reformers inthe U.S., Ms. Skorzynska was disappointed to find so muchresistance to true educational choice here. &quot;You have thesame people who oppose choice as in my country,&quot; she said.&quot;The trade unions and the education bureaucrats. Thedifference is that in my country their failures havecompletely discredited those groups.&quot;   It is ironic that the collapse of the Iron Curtain maybring East Europeans not only freedoms long cherished byAmericans but ones we don't enjoy yet. Czechoslovakia isdebating reforms of its national health system that mayemploy free-market reforms unknown in the U.S. East Europeansunderstandably look to the U.S. as a practical model ofdemocracy. At the same time, Americans may learn somethingfrom them on how to break down walls of bureaucraticprivilege that we have only begun to push against.</TEXT></DOC>
