A storm over west-central Montana produced enough snow and rain that fire crews were allowed to begin returning home. Idaho got little precipitation and crews faced some new fires.    The 7,000-acre brush fire near Vacaville, southwest of Sacramento, led to the evacuation of 65 people from 12 homes and burned at least four homes, in addition to two nonresidential buildings, a California Department of Forestry spokeswoman said. The cause was under investigation.    The spokeswoman said there was no estimate of when the fire would be contained or controlled, and problems included limited access to the area, winds of up to 35 miles per hour, rugged terrain and extremely low humidity.    The wind-swept flames also threatened about 50 other homes in the area about 55 miles northeast of San Francisco, one forest department spokesman said.    Up to six inches of snow had been forecast for Yellowstone, in northwestern Wyoming, but most of the park got only a dusting. However, by midday the temperature was still only 37 degrees, limiting fire activity and allowing crews to jump on hot spots, said one fire information officer.    The park has been besieged for nearly three months by dry weather and fires that have charred more than half its 2.2 million acres.    In west-central Montana, fire-fighting crews and the soldiers who reinforced them began pulling out of the 247,000-acre Canyon Creek fire yesterday while a storm continued to drop snow and rain. Officials said the force would be replaced by 20-member rapid-response teams in each of the three national forests that the fire affected: Lolo, Lewis and Clark and Helena.    Glacier officials said snow and rain had reduced fire danger enough to allow reopening of back-country trails and campgrounds, but with some restrictions.    A weather front that moved over Idaho on Saturday brought light precipitation, and firefighters had two new fires that started Friday and Saturday, one caused by lightning, said Nez Perce National Forest spokeswoman Mary Zabinski.    But high humidity and temperatures in the 40s helped fire-fighters in their effort to keep most Idaho wildfires within the boundaries of the Frank Church-River of No Return, Gospel Hump and Selway-Bitterroot wilderness areas. </TEXT></DOC>
