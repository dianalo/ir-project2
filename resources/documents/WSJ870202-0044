The Federal Reserve Board in Washington officially will hear arguments on applications for additional securities powers by Citicorp, Bankers Trust New York Corp. and J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., three of the nation's biggest bank holding companies.    The Fed's decision, which is expected by April, will determine whether at least four other big banks get these powers as well: Chase Manhattan Corp., Marine Midland Banks Inc., Chemical New York Corp. and Security Pacific Corp.    The big banks are seeking permission to underwrite and deal in commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities and municipal revenue bonds, and all of them except J.P. Morgan have asked for authority to underwrite securities backed by consumer receivables.    In the U.S., bank holding companies can engage in a number of investment banking-related activities that have been deemed closely connected to banking, including underwriting and dealing in municipal general-obligation bonds, and U.S. government securities. Additionally, they can trade in foreign currencies and certain money market instruments, operate discount brokerages, act as private placement agents for securities and advise clients on mergers and acquisitions. They can't, however, underwrite and deal in corporate bonds and equities even though they are allowed to do so overseas.    Big banks have been seeking broader investment banking powers for several years without success. But they believe regulatory sentiment now is finally on their side.    Confident that the Fed will decide in their favor, these banks already are mapping business strategies and contemplating new hiring programs. In at least a few instances, they are asking clients to delay underwritings that are currently off limits to them until they can bid on the business.    Investment bankers are concerned about the threatened invasion. Barry S. Friedberg, director of investment banking division, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, says: &quot;We all face some formidable competition. The banks bring huge capital resources, good credit skills and relationships&quot; with corporate and municipal clients. He adds: &quot;It's a mistake to pooh-pooh their efforts. Even if they're not highly successful, they're going to make our life uncomfortable.&quot;    If the powers are granted, the commercial banks will be jumping into hotly competitive businesses dominated by very strong players who aren't likely to give up their turf without a fight. Moreover, the arrival of the commercial banks on the scene almost inevitably will depress underwriting profits for all the participants while driving up the cost of hiring new investment banking talent.    Nevertheless, at least one of the commercial banks, which asked not to be identified, indicated that it expects the new activities to add as much as 20% to its net income after three to five years. Other banks aren't nearly as optimistic, but they are convinced these powers will contribute significantly to their overall profitability in the long term. That, they think, will come from being able to offer, on the one hand, a broader range of underwriting services to government, corporate and institutional clients, and, on the other hand, being able to sell a broader array of financial instruments to investors.    Richard W. Stuart, a Citicorp division executive for municipal finance, says: &quot;If you can't deliver it all, an issuer doesn't want to talk to you.&quot; And in turn, he explains, &quot;When I go to a municipal investor with only one-half of a product line, it penalizes me across the board.&quot;    Until recently, investment banks had successfully turned back challenges by commercial banks to the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, which generally separates commercial banking and investment banking activities.    In passing the Glass-Steagall Act, Congress concluded that widespread Depression-era bank failures were caused, at least in part, by speculative securities dealings and conflicts of interests in banking institutions.    But bankers say the climate in Washington has changed. As evidence, they point to a string of recent victories. In December, a U.S. appeals court decided to allow Bankers Trust Co., the principal banking unit of Bankers Trust New York, to sell commercial paper on behalf of its clients. A few days later, the Fed said Bankers Trust New York could sell commercial paper through a commercial lending unit. Also in late December, the New York State Banking Department ruled that state-chartered banks could set up units to underwrite corporate and other securities.    Just last week, E. Gerald Corrigan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, advanced the commercial banks' cause another step by proposing a restructuring of the financial services industry that would allow banking companies eventually to engage in securities underwriting, insurance and other financial services.    Having based their case for new powers on a provision in the Glass-Steagall Act that prohibits them from being &quot;principally engaged&quot; in underwriting &quot;ineligible&quot; securities, the banks have proposed ceilings in a bid to demonstrate that the new operations would in no way make up the bulk of their securities activities.    The banks have imposed on themselves limits on the volume of business they can undertake and the slice of the market share they can obtain. For example, most of the applicants, including J.P. Morgan and Bankers Trust New York, propose to restrict the new combined activities to less than 15% -- as reflected in two out of three measures of business activity -- of all the business of the unit in which these operations would be conducted.    Additionally, each of these same banks would limit their market share for each business activity. A single bank couldn't underwrite more than 10% of dealer-placed commercial paper, 3% of municipal revenue bonds, and a combined 3% of securities backed by mortgages and consumer receivables -- except for Morgan, which would restrict its underwriting of mortgage-backed securities to 3%.    Each of the new businesses present sharply different profit opportunities to each bank. How successful any one of them can expect to become in each activity will depend on the strength of existing related businesses, the intensity of competition from traditional investment banking firms, the maturity of the business, management commitment, and market conditions.    For example, commercial and investment bankers expect banks to adapt most easily to underwriting commercial paper, a short-term IOU issued by big corporations, because they already operate as placement agents. By definition, underwriting powers will give them the flexibility to take a position in a client's paper if they don't have a ready buyer. That, they believe, will enable them to pick up clients that have steered clear of banks because of the restrictions.    But no one harbors any illusions that this alone will translate into instant wealth for banking companies. One reason is that fees for underwriting commercial paper are already rock bottom, rarely exceeding one-eighth of a percentage point. Moreover, the business is heavily concentrated in the hands of a few big players, including Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., which have a loyal following of apparently satisfied corporate clients.    Sherman R. Lewis Jr., Shearson's vice chairman and co-director of investment banking, says commercial paper is a natural fit in terms of what banks are now doing. &quot;They already have the contacts,&quot; he says. But, he adds, commercial paper &quot;isn't profitable standing on its own. We may do commercial paper for a company for which we do a common-stock offering, or a merger or acquisition. I don't know how much synergism there is for banks until they can do other things.&quot;    Wall Street sources predict that of all the big banks that have applied for this power, Bankers Trust New York and J.P. Morgan probably will achieve the most success, mainly because of the inroads they have made already as agents. Indeed, these sources point out that success in this business may be most crucial for those two banks, because both of them have concentrated their efforts on serving the biggest corporations, which have abandoned bank financing for commercial paper.    Underwriting municipal revenue bonds is seen as another natural fit for commercial banks for one good reason: They can already underwrite general-obligation bonds and a few types of revenue issues, such as housing and higher education. But because they are barred from underwriting and dealing in revenue bond issues for projects such as roads, bridges, electric power and vocational education, roughly half of the municipal market -- which totaled about $140 billion in new issues in 1986 -- is closed to them. In arguing for the additional powers, bankers contend the risks of underwriting currently &quot;ineligible&quot; issues are indistinguishable from those inherent in eligible issues.    Underwriting profits on revenue bonds, which are backed by cash flows from specific projects, are typically higher than on general-obligation bonds, which are funded out of tax revenue. But healthy fees -- from 1% to 1.5% -- for revenue bond underwriting increasingly will be offset by a rapid shrinkage in the tax-exempt bond market caused by tough restrictions placed on these securities by the new tax law, bankers say. Citicorp's Mr. Stuart, for example, predicts that the tax-exempt market will contract by one-third in 1987 to about $100 billion.    Moreover, some commercial bankers fear that once they gain these powers, the investment banks may bar them from participating in their syndicates. Says one managing director at a big New York commercial bank: &quot;There may be problems getting into initial underwritings. I'd expect commercial banks to form syndicates to compete as a group on municipal revenue underwritings.&quot;    Bankers are particularly eager to underwrite mortgage-backed securities because of the phenomenal growth and profitability of this business in the last few years. Although banks currently are allowed to underwrite government guaranteed mortgage-backed securities, such as Ginnie Maes, they generally can't touch so-called collateralized mortgage obligations, or CMOs.    A CMO is a bond-like security backed by a pool of mortages whose cash flows are repackaged to create securities of different maturities. The device has enjoyed explosive growth because unlike traditional mortgage securities, it gives investors and underwriters some protection against prepayments by mortgage holders. Dominated by Salomon Brothers Inc. and First Boston Corp., CMO underwriting tripled in 1986 from 1985.    &quot;It's become a huge market, and we haven't tapped the potential,&quot; says Shearson's Mr. Lewis. But the mortgage-backed securities business is also risky, as the investment banks themselves discovered early last year as mortgage holders rushed to prepay their loans. &quot;In terms of losing their shirt, the greatest risk (for the banks) is in mortgage-backed securities.&quot;    But the big banks contend that their knowledge of mortgage lending, and their relationships with thousands of banks, thrifts and other mortgage originators will give them a fast start, if not an edge. Park Benjamin, a managing director for public finance at Manufacturers Hanover, says, &quot;With CMOs we don't have 25 to 50 years of relationships to overcome.&quot;    That is even more true of underwriting securities backed by consumer receivables, an activity that only began to gather momentum in 1986. Salomon Brothers is also the dominant force in this business; in 1986, the investment house underwrote for General Motors Acceptance Corp. about $4 billion of securities backed by low-rate auto loans. Here, too, retail banks think their consumer lending experience and correspondent banking connections will help. Besides car loans, other possible candidates for &quot;securitization&quot; include homeequity loans and credit-card receivables.    Says Manufacturers Hanover's Douglas E. Ebert, head of investment banking: &quot;We generate a substantial amount of consumer receivables ourselves. We've got a great capacity for originating and servicing.&quot;    ---                       Top Underwriters   Lead managers of offerings in 1986 in two areas into whichbanks are seeking to expand.
