Barrett (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> RAH AHP AET </CO><IN> PHA BCY TNM </IN><DATELINE> RICHMOND, Va.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Shirley Nichols is reading aloud to 12 other women from a file folder that chronicles her injuries. &quot;Tissue attached to the Dalkon Shield,&quot; she quotes from a pathology report. &quot;The inner lining of the uterus is shredded.&quot;    In June 1986, the file says, doctors discovered severe pelvic infection and scarring. They performed emergency surgery, removing her ovaries, Fallopian tubes and uterus. &quot;It's really graphic, isn't it?&quot; Ms. Nichols asks softly.    No one answers. The other women, standing near her in the Dalkon Shield Records Center, are staring at their own folders. The vast federal-court warehouse here holds nearly 200,000 color-coded claims of injuries blamed on the intrauterine contraceptive: pelvic inflammatory disease, ectopic pregnancy, septic abortion, infertility. At least 20 deaths have been linked to the Shield, a nickel-size plastic device sold by A.H. Robins Co. in the early 1970s.    This pilgrimage to Robins's hometown, aimed at familiarizing the women with their court records and the decisions they will soon face, marks a major transition in one of the most complicated and bitter liability cases in history. In August 1985, Robins initiated bankruptcy-law proceedings to block thousands of lawsuits over the Shield. Now the bankruptcy appears to be heading toward resolution. Lawyers for the claimants declare victory: The company's latest reorganization plan would create a landmark $2.38 billion trust to compensate the injured.    But many of the women who have waited years for Robins to make amends can't see the settlement as a triumph. When the money gets divided up -- lawyers predict that the first checks won't be mailed until early 1989, and that many claims won't be processed for years -- most of them can hope for only small individual settlements, in many cases less than $1,000 each. To extract significant sums, they may have to endure strenuous negotiations, produce stacks of medical evidence (locating medical records will be the main obstacle for most claimants) and withstand tough cross-examination.    Many details of the trust's operation -- including specific payment levels -- remain unresolved. Under Robins's proposed reorganization plan, American Home Products Corp., a New York-based pharmaceuticals and household-products giant, would acquire Robins and fund the bulk of the trust.    If the reorganization stays on schedule, the Shield claimants, along with Robins's shareholders, will be mailed information about the plan and asked to vote on it this spring. But at present many of the women know little about the approval process, and some resent the basic theory behind the trust: that it will stand in Robins's place and diminish legal confrontation by offering quick, usually modest settlements.    Karen Hicks, the 40-year-old Bethlehem, Pa., resident who organized the visit to the center, tries to explain the necessity of the trip. &quot;Every one of these files is a human life,&quot; she says with tears in her eyes. &quot;We have to affirm that we're not just statistics.&quot;    The bankruptcy lawyers and court officials who designed the trust defend the arrangement as a fair means of preserving money for those with the strongest evidence. They note that many women who couldn't hope to win lawsuits will receive settlement offers from the trust.    Even some of the personal-injury attorneys representing individual women estimate that only 30,000 to 50,000 of the claims are &quot;lawsuit caliber&quot; and deserve significant compensation. &quot;They tell you they've gone through hell for years, but often it's pain and bleeding and nothing more,&quot; says Michael Pretl, a Baltimore lawyer representing about 1,000 American and foreign claimants.    Mr. Pretl says his firm has accepted only cases that are &quot;cost-effective,&quot; meaning that he expects them to yield settlements of $25,000 to $200,000. For others, he says, &quot;you can have plenty of sympathy, but if there isn't serious permanent damage, they're not getting more than a pittance&quot; from the trust.    Some women have already given up. Cinders Murdock-Vaughn underwent a total hysterectomy in 1977 after doctors discovered that her reproductive organs were encased in adhesions and scar tissue linked to using the Dalkon Shield. But the San Francisco clinic where she had the Shield inserted closed long ago; its records disappeared. The doctor who removed the IUD destroyed Ms. Murdock-Vaughn's files in 1979 as part of a routine office cleaning.    &quot;I was outraged, but I was impotent,&quot; she says, adding that she decided to avoid the indignity of seeking a minimal payment and hasn't filed a claim.    Others are bent on showing their indignation. Ms. Hicks, for one, concedes she wants &quot;revenge, people thrown in jail, huge money awards, public punishment. The quiet, efficient bureaucracy (of the trust) doesn't satisfy me.&quot;    During their visit to Richmond, several claimants expressed similar sentiments as they met informally with U.S. District Judge Robert Merhige Jr., who is supervising the Robins bankruptcy. In response, the judge, who patiently answered questions, sternly admonished the group to &quot;control your anger&quot; at Robins, now that the company is almost certain to be removed from the process.    To some claimants, however, Robins will never be out of their lives. They want people to remember the fierce pre-bankruptcy litigation in which the company and its insurer paid Shield victims some $530 million in trial awards and settlements. In a June 1987 decision, the Kansas Supreme Court upheld a $7.5 million punitive-damage award after finding &quot;substantial evidence&quot; that Robins &quot;deliberately, intentionally and actively concealed the dangers of the Shield for year after year.&quot;    Scientific studies have concluded that the device caused infections that led to severe complications. Robins still contends other factors, including sexually transmitted disease, contributed to the injuries. The company also insists the Shield isn't any more dangerous than other IUDs.    The Shield's contentious history continues to haunt the claimants. After 2 1/2 years of legal and corporate jousting in bankruptcy court, they are still apprehensive about the settlement process. The experiences of three women illustrate the depth of their fears.    'We Aren't Experienced Negotiators or Lawyers'   Ms. Hicks sees the Shield trust through a prism of rage. She blames the Robins IUD for a decade of painful infections that culminated in her emotional collapse and divorce. Four days after she was remarried in 1984, she blacked out and almost died as a result of a massive attack of pelvic inflammatory disease.    &quot;I got remarried because we wanted to have children,&quot; she says. &quot;On the one-week anniversary of my marriage, I had a total hysterectomy.&quot;    In January 1987, Ms. Hicks started an advocacy group called the Dalkon Shield Information Network out of her home. The former university administrator, who is now working on a Ph.D., fears that people will forget about the harm caused by the Shield because claimants will be &quot;intimidated&quot; into accepting low settlements from the trust. &quot;We aren't experienced negotiators or lawyers,&quot; she says, adding that she believes most women &quot;will take what they're given.&quot;    For her own part, Ms. Hicks says her lawyer has plenty of ammunition to win a big award. And if the trust resists, she vows to take advantage of the option to sue the trust in court. &quot;I lost most of my adult life,&quot; she says. &quot;I won't go quietly.&quot;    'I Can't Put a Money Value on My Pain'   Some claimants say they hope compensation from the Shield trust will close a painful chapter of their lives. For Mary Stone, however, the end isn't in sight.    During a recent meeting with her lawyer, she was stricken with a recurrence of the severe abdominal pain that preceded her hysterectomy in 1977. The operation had come in response to years of infections attributed to her using the Shield.    &quot;What I thought was over isn't over,&quot; says Ms. Stone, 37, who lives in Forest Hill, Md. She is currently taking painkillers and undergoing medical tests. She says the pain has been so bad that she has missed more than a week of work at her job as a bank teller.    Doctors familiar with Shield injuries say that thousands of women may continue to suffer complications in coming years. At particular risk, according to some plaintiffs' attorneys, are those who live in less-developed countries, where the Shield is still being used.    Ms. Stone has filed a claim but says she doesn't care about the money. &quot;I can't put a money value on my pain or on the child I couldn't have,&quot; she explains. &quot;All I want is this pain gone away.&quot;    One more thing she wants: &quot;I'd like to get (Robins officials) across the table and get them to apologize to me. That would be worth millions.&quot;    'My Biological Clock Is Ticking'   Jessica Saponari still has hope that after eight operations, including the sealing of her Fallopian tubes, she can become a mother. She's depending on the trust to help pay for in vitro fertilization.    At age 33, the mortgage-company executive from Corpus Christi, Texas, is one of a group of claimants for whom the trust could have an immediate impact by paying for artificial-conception procedures. Total costs for the in vitro process range from $6,500 to $10,000.    Most health-insurance policies don't cover the procedure because it is elective. Success rates range from 5% to 30%, depending on the clinic, and women typically attempt it several times.    Ms. Saponari's first try failed, and she has another scheduled for August. &quot;We can probably afford the next one,&quot; she says. &quot;But if that doesn't work, I don't know if we could do it alone.&quot; The trust is designed to expedite settlements for those in Ms. Saponari's position. Still, she worries that delay could end her chances of pregnancy. &quot;My biological clock is ticking,&quot; she says. &quot;The older you get, (the more) your chances go down&quot; for a successful in vitro procedure.    Ms. Saponari estimates that she has spent at least $30,000 on uninsured medical bills linked to Shield-related problems. Determined to win a big settlement from the trust, she has hired a lawyer who will take one-third of her award as a fee. Tallying the figures, she notes, &quot;I'll need to get a lot just to break even on costs.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
