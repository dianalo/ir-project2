Con Edison would use the imported gas to supplement its systemsupply. In its application, Con Edison states that the initial term ofthe purchase contract is to run through October 31, 14 years after thefirst year of the contract. The contract also provides for secondary termof five years unless either party gives notice of termination. The firstcontract year will commence on the date of initial delivery of the gasand on the next following October 31. The purchase price for the imported gas would be composed of a two-partdemand/commodity rate. The monthly demand charge would equal the sum ofthe monthly demand tolls paid by Amoco Canada to Nova Corporation of Alberta(Nova) and TransCanada PipeLines Limited (TCPL) for the transportationof the gas in Canada. The commodity charge would equal the average of thesales rates of Con Edison's three principal domestic pipeline suppliers(Base Index), minus the Canadian and domestic transportation charges (bothdemand and commodity). During summer seasons, the commodity charge wouldbe subject to price caps. Specifically, the commodity charge for all gastaken up to 35 percent of the maximum daily contract quantity (MDQ) of30,000 MMBtu per day could not exceed the equivalent of designated fueloil prices and, for gas taken in excess of 35 percent of the MDQ, the BaseIndex would be reduced to the same equivalent of designated fuel oil prices,subject to a specified floor price. The application asserts that the purchasecontract prescribes that the commodity charge would be calculated monthlyand that after 1995, either party may request a redetermination of thecommodity charge is the Base Index component differs by more than a specificamount for spot gas sales. The purchase contract also permits terminationby either party if agreement on redetermination cannot be reached and providesfor a phaseout period of up to four years. All of the price provisionsof the purchase contract are subject to renegotiation upon notice by eitherparty and if agreement cannot be reached, either party may request thatthe matter be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the proceduresprescribed in the contract. Con Edison has no take-or-pay obligation under the purchase contract butwould be subjected to a gas inventory charge (GIC) based on the averageof the gas inventory charge rates of Con Edison's primary domestic pipelinesuppliers. The monthly GIC would be subject to refund based on cumulativepurchases over a contract year. Con Edison states that delivery of gas would begin as soon as possibleafter all governmental authorizations are received and after all necessarytransportation facilities have been constructed and placed into service.The purchase contract provides that if construction of the required facilitieshas not commenced by April 3, 1991, either party may request terminationof the contract. Transportation of the gas from the point of delivery atthe international border near Niagara, Ontario, to Con Edison's gas distributionfacilities in New York City will be through the pipeline systems of TranscontinentalGas Pipeline Company (Transco), Tennessee Gas Pipeline Company (Tennessee),and National Fuel Gas Supply Corporation (National Fuel). According toCon Edison, each of the transporters has an application pending beforethe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) proposing to constructand operate the new pipeline facilities which would be required beforeCon Edison can begin importing this gas. Tennessee's application in FERCDocket No. CP88-171-000 is to construct pipeline looping and compressionfacilities on its Niagara Spur Line from Niagara to its Lewiston, New York,interconnection with National Fuel. National Fuel's application in FERCDocket No. CP88-194-000 is to construct a compressor station and pipelinefacilities from Lewiston to a proposed interconnection with Transco atLeidy, Pennsylvania. Transco's application in FERC Docket No. CP88-171-000is to construct pipeline looping and compression facilities between Leidyand New York City. In support of its application, Con Edison asserts that the imported gasis needed to meet projected increases in its system requirements. Con Edisonalso contends that the gas would be purchased in accordance with flexiblepricing terms assuring that the import would be competitive over the termof the requested authorization. Further, according to the application,Amoco Canada would dedicate 170 Bcf of specified reserves to the contractualarrangement thus assuring the ability of Amoco Canada to supply the gasto Con Edison. The decision on Con Edison's application for import authority will be madeconsistent with the DOE's gas import policy guidelines, under which thecompetitiveness of an import arrangement in the markets served is the primaryconsideration in determining whether it is in the public interest (49 FR6684, February 22, 1984). Other considerations include, but are not limitedto, need for the gas and the security of the long-term supply. The applicantasserts that this import arrangement is competitive, the gas is needed,and the in FERC Docket No. CP88-171-000 is to construct pipeline loopingand compression facilities on its Niagara Spur Line from Niagara to itsLewiston, New York, interconnection with National Fuel.

The applicantasserts that this import arrangement is competitive, the gas is needed,and the supply source is secure. Parties opposing the import arrangementbear the burden of overcoming these assertions. <ITAG tagnum="84">NEPA Compliance </ITAG>The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) (42 U.S.C. 4321 <T3>et seq.</T3>) requires the DOE to give appropriate consideration tothe environmental effects of its proposed actions. The FERC is currentlyperforming an environmental review of the impacts of constructing and operatingthe proposed pipeline facilities of Transco, Tennessee, and National Fuelsbefore making its decision on their certificate applications. The DOE willparticipate in the environmental review process at the appropriate level.No final decision will be issued in this proceeding until the DOE has metits NEPA responsibilities regarding the Con Edison application. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment Procedures </ITAG>In response to this notice, any person may file a protest, motion to interveneor notice of intervention, as applicable and written comments.
