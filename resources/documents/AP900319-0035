(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sylvia Jenkins is matter-of-fact about thedrug conviction that landed her in federal prison, but mention hertwo young grandchildren and tears trickle down her cheeks.   ``It's very hard,'' said Jenkins, who won't let the childrenvisit her because she hates to watch them leave. ``Every time theywant to come up, I say, `Not this weekend.'''   Jenkins, 52, is pulling a five-year stretch at the FederalCorrectional Institution in Danbury. She has a running track, aview of gentle hills and a job as a tutor.   And now, there are also innovative programs to help people likeher deal with the emotions of being a mother or grandmother behindbars _ and the reunion when she finishes her time.   There are more than 2,000 mothers in federal prisons across thecountry. The system is providing such things as parenting classesand special visitation days.   The government wants female inmates to be better prepared whenthey leave prison to deal with their families, said Ann Bartolo,chief of the female offender section of the federal Bureau ofPrisons.   Bartolo's latest project is a program allowing pregnant inmatesto stay at halfway houses three months after giving birth so theycan keep the babies with them. Mothers now can keep their babiesonly two days before giving them to relatives or foster families.   About 3,150 women live in eight permanent and five temporaryfacilities in the federal prison system. About 75 percent havechildren, ranging in age from 6 months to 45 years. Fifty inmatesare pregnant.   Danbury is considered one of the better prisons. It's aminimum-security camp on the fringe of a men's penitentiary. Thereare no bars, and pictures of loved ones are allowed atop shortmetal lockers where inmates keep their clothes.   The prison started a special family day last year, allowingchildren inside for a day to see where mother eats and sleeps.   ``It's fairly relaxed. There's nothing up there that gives you aprison atmosphere,'' said superintendent John Sullivan, a father ofseven who oversees 170 women in the camp and 1,100 men in thepenitentiary.   Children also attend events like graduations, where they seetheir mothers in caps and gowns accepting high school diplomas.   Another of the federal system's programs has playrooms inwomen's prisons and sets up a counseling service for familyemergencies, such as drug arrests or bad grades in school, Bartolosaid.   A parenting class is so popular in Danbury it even draws inmateswithout children. The program helps women understand theirrelationship with their own parents while teaching them to dealwith their children.   ``It's training the inmate in parenting skills _ what does itmean now that they're going to be in for X amount of years and thischild most likely will be attached to a foster parent,'' Bartolosaid.   ``It helps the mother (after she's released) to slowly walk intothis child's life and also to deal with her skills as a parent, howto deal with discipline and anger the child feels that she wasn'twith her all the time.''</TEXT></DOC>
