 And thesame color looks different on different monitors.andP;  Although 100-percentWYSIWYG is impossible -- the monitor can't display some colors that can beprinted, and vice versa -- several companies are making strides in this area.andM;Radius is marketing the PrecidisionColor Calibrator, which is a combinationof optical-sensing hardware and proprietary software.andP;  The Calibrator, an ADBdevice that attaches to the screen with a suction cup, measures the output ofred, green, and blue light and provides feedback to the PrecisionColorsoftware, which adjusts the color temperature and tonal (gamma) settings toachieve accurate Pantone Color simulations.andP;  Calibration takes about threeminutes and provides Pantone screen colors that are reasonable approximationsof their printed counterparts.andM;You can adjust gamma settings to improve the display of scanned images, andthe color-temperature control lets you compensate for changes in ambientlight or differences between monitors.andP;  It's too early to say how frequentlyyou'll have to recalibrate you display, but most systems seem stable oncethey're on an hour or so.andP;  So far, the $ 695 Calibrator works only withRadius set-ups and Apple's 8-bit-color system; the company may add supportfor other display systems in the future.andM;Radius and Pantone are jointly developing the Pantone Color Resource, asoftware technology that will standardize the way the applications implementand display Pantone Color simulations.andP;  Right now, for example, PageMaker andQuarkXPress generte Pantone colors that have different RGB values, and thuslook different on-screen.andP;  Radius, 1710 Fortune Drive, San Jose, CA 95131;(408) 434-1010.andM;The first firm to address color calibration was Barco, which introduced its19-inch Calibrator monitor last summer.andP;  The $ 6,700 unit works with severalvideo cards, including those from Radius, RasterOps, and SupreMac.andP;  TheRasibrator is aimed at the high-end prepress market, and has a microprocessorthat controls all visual elements, including sharpness, geometry, and colorquality.andP;  Colors are calibrated with the Optisense ($695), a sensor thatattaches to the screen with a suction cup.andP;  Color accuracy is tied to CIEstandards rather than Pantone colors, and the monitor's electronicsautomatically compensate for various forms of color drift.andP;  You can specifycalibration for both the color temperature and the luminance.andP;  BarcoIndustries, 472 Amherst St., Nashua, NH 03063; (603) 880-1430.andM;RasterOps has repacked the Barco monitor and Optisense as the RasterOpsCalibrator ($8,650).andP;  Add one of RasterOps' ColorBoards for an even moreupscale solution ($ 10,245 with the 8-bit board or $13,845 for the 24-bitsystem).andP;  RasterOps, 2500 Walsh Ave., Santa Clara, CA 95051; (408) 562-4200.andM;A third player, Tektronix, is using software to solve the problem of WYSIWYGcolor.andP;  Its new color-fidelity system, TekColor, helps you choose screencolors that have exact matches on your printer.andP;  TekColor is a cdev and itcomes with a database for each supported monitor and printer.andP;  The TekColorPicker transparently replaces the Apple Color Picker and shows which colorscan be both displayed and printed.andP;  (If you have a 24-bit board, you can geta smoother display by Option-clicking outside the dialog box.)andP;  When youpress Print while working within an application, TekColor intercepts the dataand does color adjustments on the fly, matching the output to the screencolors.andM;TekColor is based on Tektronix's TekHVC (hue-value-chroma) color model, whichin turn is derived from the CIE color standard.andP;  Tektronix hopes to getTekColor adopted as an industry standard for color fidelity, so TekColor hasan open interface and the specifications are available without charge toother vendors.andP;  TekColor ($50) currently works with four display systems: theApple color monitor, Radius Color Display, E-Machines T19, and RasterOpsColorBoard 224.andP;  For output, TekColor so far works only with Tektronix'sColorQuick ink-jet printer, but the firm plans to add support for itsthermal-transfer printers.andP;  Tektronix, Graphics Printing and ImagingDivision, Box 1000, Mail Station 63-630, Wilsonville, OR 97070;
