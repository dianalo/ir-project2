Melican, general counsel, said InternationalPaper's mill in Moss Point, Miss., meets all environmentalpermits and limits imposed by state and federal agencies.   &quot;This is a manufactured lawsuit filed by a handful ofplaintiffs' attorneys who have been aggressively solicitingclients for months, including by advertising in localnewspapers,&quot; Mr. Melican said. The company will &quot;aggressivelydefend&quot; the suit, he added.   The suit, filed in Jackson County, Miss., chancery court,seeks to enjoin the companies from continuing the allegedpractices. It asks for a judgment of $150,000 plus $1 millionin punitive damages, for each plaintiff.   In Atlanta, a spokeswoman for Georgia-Pacific Corp. saidthe company still hadn't seen a copy of the lawsuit. She saidthere &quot;isn't any merit&quot; to allegations outlined in a storyabout the suit in Friday's Wall Street Journal. She addedthat Georgia-Pacific &quot;plans to defend itself vigorously.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
