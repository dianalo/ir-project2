A panel of the appeals court here ruled 2-1 on Friday thatthe prosecution failed to prove that the testimony Mr.Poindexter was compelled to give to Congress in 1987, under apromise of immunity, hadn't been used against him during histrial last year on charges that he lied to Congress anddestroyed evidence.</LP><TEXT>   The ruling underscored the risks Congress takes when itcompels testimony from officials who later may be subject tocriminal prosecution.   The decision relied heavily on the appeals court's earlierruling that led to the dismissal of charges against OliverNorth, another central player in the Iran-Contra scandal.Messrs. Poindexter and North supervised secret Reaganadministration ventures to sell arms to Iran and siphon offsome of the profits to aid the military efforts of Nicaraguanrebels, known as Contras.   Separately, Elliott Abrams, an assistant secretary ofstate during the Reagan adminstration, was sentenced to twoyears of probation and 100 hours of community service for hisguilty pleas on two misdemeanor counts related to his role inthe Iran-Contra affair. Mr. Abrams has agreed to cooperate inthe continuing investigation into covert arms sales, militaryaid to the Contras, and subsequent lying to Congress.   In the Poindexter decision, Judge Douglas Ginsburg wrotethe majority opinion, stressing that a number of witnesses&quot;may have been prejudicially influenced by their exposure toPoindexter's immunized testimony&quot; to Congress. But thetestimony of the central witness, Mr. North, was clearly&quot;tainted,&quot; Judge Ginsburg wrote.   So sure was the majority of that conclusion that itrefused to allow the prosecution any additional opportunityto prove that Mr. North's testimony had been based on hispersonal knowledge, as opposed to his listening to or readingabout Mr. Poindexter's congressional testimony. Mr. Northsaid on the witness stand that he had immersed himself in Mr.Poindexter's congressional testimony and insisted that hecouldn't remember what he knew because of his own experiencesand what he knew from Mr. Poindexter's congressionalappearance.   Lawrence Walsh, the Iran-Contra prosecutor, said he wouldstudy the opinion; if he wishes to continue the prosecutionhis two options are to ask for reconsideration by the fullappeals court or to seek Supreme Court review.   Richard Beckler, Mr. Poindexter's lead lawyer, said, &quot;Weare going to try to talk {the prosecutor} out of goingforward, but if he does appeal, we'll continue to fight thiscase. It never should have been brought.&quot;   Writing in dissent, Chief Judge Abner Mikva observed thatthe appeals court in its ruling in the North case had made itmuch more difficult to prosecute public officials for allegedcrimes after they have given immunized testimony to Congress.But Judge Mikva asserted that Mr. Walsh should have beengiven a chance under the new legal standard to try to provethat court testimony wasn't colored by the defendant'sprotected congressional testimony.   The appeals court gave Mr. Walsh such an opportunity inthe North case, but the prosecutor dropped all remainingcharges after a truncated hearing in which it became clearthat he couldn't satisfy the court's stringent new standardon immunized testimony.</TEXT></DOC>
