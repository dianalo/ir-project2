(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jim Bakker says God has forgiven him forhis sins, but his lawyer is afraid the TV evangelist will have atougher time setting things straight with a no-nonsense federaljudge they call ``Maximum Bob.''   Bakker could be sent to prison for 120 years and fined more than$5.2 million when he goes before U.S. District Judge Robert Potteron Tuesday for sentencing for fraud and conspiracy.   ``Maximum Bob will probably knock a year off the maximum,''defense attorney George Davis joked ruefully.   The judge lived up to his moniker last month when he sentencedformer Bakker aide David Taggart to 18 years and five months inprison for tax evasion.   ``One can only speculate Jim will get a heavier sentence thanTaggart _ it's a foregone conclusion,'' Davis said in an interview.Taggart also was fined $500,000.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Jerry Miller said prosecutors will askfor a prison sentence, but he refused to elaborate.   Miller also declined to say if the government will ask thatBakker be taken into custody immediately after sentencing;prosecutors unsuccessfully tried to jail him after his conviction.   Bakker, 49, was convicted Oct. 5 on 24 counts of fraud andconspiracy for overselling $158 million in lifetime vacations, or``partnerships,'' at PTL's resort hotels. The jury found thatBakker used more than $3.7 million to buy luxurious homes, fancycars, jewelry and expensive vacations.   The six-week trial was briefly interrupted by Bakker'scommitment to a mental hospital after a breakdown.   ``God has forgiven me for my sins,'' he told followers from thepulpit last week at his New Covenant Church in Orlando, Fla. ``I'mnot guilty.''   Taggart and his brother, James, were convicted of diverting morethan $1.1 milion in PTL money for their own use and cheating thegovernment out of $525,000 in taxes.   James Taggart drew the maximum prison term _ 17 years and ninemonths _ and was fined $500,000. Both Taggarts testified againstBakker.   Potter, a Reagan appointee on the bench for eight years, ``canbe harsh when it's called for, compassionate when it's justified,''Charlotte lawyer George Laughrun said last month.   If a defendant admits his guilt, Potter is likely to weigh thatin his favor, Laughrun said. If Potter thinks a defendant is lying,he's likely to hold that against him, the lawyer said.   Before sentencing the Taggarts, Potter said he thought they hadlied on the stand. But Potter gave former PTL executive RichardDortch eight years out of a possible 10 after Dortch pleadedguilty, apologized and agreed to testify for the government.</TEXT></DOC>
