Richard L. Thornburghtook office as the nation's 76th attorney general Friday with a vowto ``make drug trafficking and drug abuse Public Enemy No. 1.''   Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, one of the conservativejurists appointed to the court by President Reagan, administeredthe oath of office to Thornburgh in the Roosevelt Room of the WhiteHouse.   Reagan saluted Thornburgh as an ex-prosecutor with ``anationwide reputation for attacking the drug problem head on andcracking down on drug traffickers.''   Thornburgh succeeds outgoing Attorney General Edwin Meese III,who resigned after saying he had been vindicated by an independentcounsel investigation of his affairs.   Reagan paid tribute to work done in the drug area by by bothMeese andd Vice President George Bush, the prospective Republicanpresidential nominee.   ``Under Vice President Bush's leadership, federal, state andlocal law enforcement officials have been working together as neverbefore to stop drug runners from smuggling illegal drugs into theUnited States,'' he said.   ``The results of that work and the work that Attorney GeneralMeese led are incredible.''   Bush was present at the swearing-in ceremony, but Meese did notattend.   Thornburgh swore his oath on a Bible once owned by William Penn,the founder of Pennsylvania. It was held by his wife, Virginia.   ``I firmly believe that unless we sustain a vigorous effort tomake drug trafficking and drug abuse Public Enemy No. 1, we couldwell stunt significantly the capacity of today's young people tocontribute to a better quality of life for tomorrow's America,''Thornburgh said.   He said said he would use ``every resource of the Department ofJustice, consistent with strict observance of the civil rights andcivil liberties of all our citizens, to fight other unique threatsto our traditional values.''   Thornburgh, 56, was confirmed by the Senate late Thursday.   Meese's ethical behavior was investigated by Independent CounselJames McKay, who concluded that the attorney general ``probably''broke the law but decided not to seek his indictment. Meese deniedany improprieties, and maintained that the department was runningnormally despite defections by top aides during his final months asattorney general.   Thornburgh headed the Justice Department's criminal divisionduring the Ford administration in the mid-1970s and established thepublic integrity section that prosecutes corrupt public officials.</TEXT></DOC>
