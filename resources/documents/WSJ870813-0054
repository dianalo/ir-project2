Boesky won't be punished as scheduled this month.    The arbitrager, who pleaded guilty April 23 to conspiring to make false statements to the Securities and Exchange Commission, had been scheduled to be sentenced next Friday by U.S. District Judge Morris E. Lasker. The sentencing now has been rescheduled for Oct. 9, but for all practical purposes, it has been postponed indefinitely.    Such postponements are common for defendants such as Mr. Boesky, whose cooperation with the government is integral to other pending insider-trading cases. The six defendants in the Dennis B. Levine insider-trading case all have been sentenced, but sentencings for those involved in the related Boesky case have been put on hold.    Mr. Boesky faces a maximum of five years in prison and $250,000 in fines for the SEC violation, which represents his total criminal liability in the insidertrading case. He also settled related civil SEC charges by giving up $100 million in assets. </TEXT></DOC>
