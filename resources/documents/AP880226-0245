The exercise is relatively simple, nothing like having to learna whole new language. And it seems a logical way to try tounderstand what has motivated foreign investors operating in thiscountry in the recent past, and what they might do in the future.   The dollar, of course, has taken a drastic drop since themid-1980s against important foreign currencies.   In early 1985, a dollar could be exchanged for more than 250Japanese yen. Recently, it was worth about 129 yen. Similarly, theexchange rate has fallen from more than 3 West German marks perdollar to about 1.7.   To understand the kind of impact such wide swings can have onfinancial decisions and distort the way they are perceived, BurtonSiegel, chief investment officer at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,speaks of the ``Dave Righetti effect.''   As followers of the sports pages know, Righetti is a standoutpitcher for the New York Yankees who was offered, and decided notto accept, a deal to play in Japan under a two-year contract thatwould pay him something on the order of $10 million.   Even in these days of boxcar-number sports salaries, the figurewas regarded as mindboggling.   But as Siegel points out: ``In currency-adjusted terms, theoffer was handsome, but not quite as expensive to the Japanese asit first appears. Indeed, when adjusted for the yen-dollarrelationship, the proposal was in line with salaries being paid totop players in the United States.   ``The same analyses can be applied to recent auctions of fineart in which Japanese and Euopean collectors-investors bid updollar prices.''   What does all this mean for other businesses and the stock andbond markets?   If the dollar is going to keep dropping in foreign exchange, itwould be a negative for foreign investors, reducing or eliminatingthe return they realize from investments denominated in dollars.   But if the dollar is perceived as fundamentally cheap, the storycould well be very different.   Says Siegel: ``Foreign corporations may be especially attractedto the opportunity to acquire existing U.S.-based operating assets.This avoids the delay of starting from scratch and can sometimes bedone at lower cost.   ``This may be especially appealing to foreign companiesinterested in handling U.S.-produced goods through their owninternational distribution systems.   ``Foreign companies anxious to increase or maintain their marketshare in the U.S. may also be attracted to the ability to producein the now cost-competitive U.S.''   Thinking in yen or marks yields another interesting point: Whenstated in those currencies, Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock compositeindex is now substantially below where it stood at the beginning of1985.   Thus, from a foreign investors' viewpoint, Wall Street has beenexperiencing a bear market for more than three years.   There is a danger in carrying this kind of analysis too far. Toillustrate that, Greg Smith, an analyst at Prudential-BacheSecurities, recently suggested a remedy if a friend or relativeremarks that you seem to have put on weight lately: ``Tell themthat in yen, you have actually lost five pounds.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Monday Feb. 29</NOTE></DOC>
