While revenuescontinued to improve from their historic low posted in the third quarterof 1986, earnings, which had improved quarter-to-quarter earlier thisyear, showed no improvement from the second to the third quarter. Twoprimary factors in improved revenues were the continuing recovery incrude-oil and refined-product revenues. Crude-oil revenues were up 51%from the third quarter of 1986 and up 7% from the second quarter of thisyear; refined-product revenues were up 30% from the 1986 quarter andup 4% from the second quarter. This improvement was partially offsetby a decline in natural gas revenues (down 8% from 86Q3 and down 9% from87Q2).</TEXT></DOC>
