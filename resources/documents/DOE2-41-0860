Its objectives include providing alternatives to conventionalpetroleum, thereby maintaining Canada's energy self-sufficiency. Thisdocument describes research and development programs of the NLF in thefollowing areas: direct liquefaction, or the production of liquid fuelsfrom coal, biomass, or mixtures of coal with bitumen, heavy oils andresidues; gasification, in which liquid fuels are produced by the indirectliquefaction of coal or biomass in which gasification is an essentialstep; production of liquid or gaseous fuels from biomass by biologicalprocesses; upgrading of synthetic crudes and conversion of natural gasto liquid fuels; fuel use programs, establishing the technical, economicand regulatory basis for deployment of liquid fuels for use in transportation;hydrogen and energy storage, including storage of electricity for useas a transport fuel; study of environmental impacts of new liquid fuelsand abatement technologies; and planning and coordination of new liquidfuels research and federal polciy development. Includes lists of contractsand publications. 348 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
