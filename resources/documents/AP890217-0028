Asia Watch, a private monitoring group, said nearly 100,000refugees are virtual prisoners in camps in Thailand but controlledby the Khmer Rouge, the Marxist group that ruled Cambodia from 1975into 1979.   It said the refugees are subjected to torture, summaryexecutions, forced labor, denial of food and exposure to mines andshelling.   In the camps, ``policies that have made them internationalpariahs'' are again pursued by the Khmer Rouge, Asia Watch said in a45-page report based on recent interviews along the border and newsdispatches.   ``Systematic human rights abuses ... and the determination tokeep refugees away from the `contaminating' influence of Western andinternational aid agencies are chillingly reminiscent of thebarbarous practices that characterized Khmer Rouge rule in Cambodiafrom 1975-79,'' it said.   Marked by purges, starvation and depopulation of cities, thoseyears became known as ``The Killing Fields'' era, the title of aU.S. motion picture on the period.   ``The international community must now insist that refugees inKhmer Rouge-controlled camps be allowed to choose whether they wishto remain in those camps or be transferred elsewhere,'' it said.   The report was issued Thursday, on the eve of weekend diplomatictalks in Jakarta, Indonesia, aimed at ending the 10-year Vietnameseoccupation of Cambodia that ended Khmer Rouge rule.   Asia Watch said recent Khmer Rouge activities suggest a comingbid to regain power in Cambodia, and that Thailand should bepersuaded to crack down against the group.   The United States, numerous human rights organizations, and Asiangovernments participating in the Jakarta talks all have declaredopposition to a return of Khmer Rouge control.   The report said there is a danger that protection of theCambodian refugees will be overlooked during fast-paced diplomaticactivity on Cambodia involving China, the Soviet Union, Vietnam, andthe Association of Southeast Asian Nations.   ``A change in Thai government policy is the first step,'' AsiaWatch said. ``International pressure on Thailand to establish andenforce international access to all refugee camps is ... essential.''   The Thais, seeking to use the Khmer Rouge ``as a buffer betweenthe Thai military and Vietnamese forces inside Cambodia, haveacquiesced in the Khmer Rouge's refusal to let civilians who wish todo so leave camps under its control,'' it said.   But a new phase of the conflict, with prospects for Vietnamesewithdrawal and solution of Cambodia's external problems, no longerjustifies this, it added.   Asia Watch said the Khmer Rouge depend on Thailand for food, armsand other logistical support.   ``Weapons supply to the Khmer Rouge and the transfer of theseweapons across the Thai border into Cambodia should be terminatedimmediately,'' it said. ``It is clear from ... its efforts tostockpile weapons inside Cambodia that the Khmer Rouge is preparingfor a protracted war.''   Asia Watch described teen-agers and women forced to carry weaponsand ammunition from Thailand across heavily mined frontier zonesinto Cambodia, with heavy casualties, denial of medical care andabandonment of the crippled.   Between last June and November, the Khmer Rouge attempted toshift 15,000 refugees to Cambodia from widely separated locations inThailand, it said, indicating ``they were part of a central policy''probably ordered by leaders Pol Pot and Ieng Sary ``who observersbelieve continue to be the primary decision-makers.''</TEXT></DOC>
