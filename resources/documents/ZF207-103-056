(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>PRINTS CHARMINGandM;Xerox, with the help of Laser Science Imaging, has made inroads into theworld of DEC LN03 printer emulation.andM;The Xerox 4045 Laser CP Model 150 printer, in combination with LaserScience's XLN03 emulation cartridge and one or more font cartridges, providesthorough emulation of DEC's LN03 laser printer.andP;  In addition, Xerox offers aWPS-Plus printer table that lets users print their WPS-Plus documents on aXerox printer as if it were an LN03.andP;  The 4045 is certainly no space-saver.andO;Including its stacker/feeder option, the printer measures 38-1/4 inches wideby 20 inches high by 21-1/5 inches deep.andM;The printer, which is also capable of emulating Xerox 2700 and Diablo 630printers, can be connected to host systems through an RS-232-C asynchronousinterface, a Centronics interface or an optional dataproducts interface.andM;Three paper trays, each able to hold 250 sheets, are part of the printer'sstacker/feeder attachment.andP;  Users can switch trays between print jobs orduring the same print job.andP;  This feature is especially useful for users whomust combine different forms in a single output document.andP;  For example, userscan put letterhead stationery in one tray and bond paper in another, and havethe 4045 print the first page of each document on letterhead and the rest onbond paper.andM;A &quot;jogger&quot; feature on the stacker/feeder can stack each print job slightly toone side of the last, making it easier to separate print jobs on a heavilyused printer.andM;The 4045 is also equipped with a built-in photocopier.andP;  Although not designedfor large copying jobs, this photocopier is ideal for &quot;casual copiers&quot; whoneed to make copies on the fly.andM;Font cartridges let users adapt the 4045 to meet different printingrequirements.andP;  The printer has five cartridge slots, which are numbered 0 to4; slot 0 must hold the Xerox configuration cartridge.andM;Indicators on the printer's control panel keep users advised about theprinter's status.andP;  For instance, they signal when users should add paper, addtoner or clear paper jams.andP;  A chime alert, which can be turned on or off,signals the end of print jobs.andM;UP AND RUNNINGandM;Installation of the printer with its stacker/feeder attachment at DR Labsrequired the services of a Xerox technician.andP;  Once it had been installed, weconnected the printer to a Local Area Transport port with an RS-232-C cableand verified that all switches on the Xerox configuration cartridge werecorrectly set for our printing needs.andM;After the printer was physically set up, we started to test it.andP;  We split thetesting process into two parts.andP;  First, we tested Laser Science's LN03emulation and font cartridges; following that we tested the Xerox-suppliedWPS-Plus printer table.andM;Laser Science sells three different LN03 font cartridges for the Xeroxprinter--an office font cartridge, a technical font cartridge and asupplemental font cartridge.andP;  All three must be used with Laser Science'sXLN03 cartridge.andP;  We used the office font cartridge for our tests.andM;To install the Laser Science cartridges, a user must take the Xerox printeroff line, insert the XLN03 personality cartridge in slot 4 and insert fontcartridges in slots 1 through 3.andP;  After performing a &quot;soft&quot; reboot of theprinter and checking the printer's configuration sheet to verify that theprinter recognizes the additional cartridges, the user is ready to print LN03print jobs on this printer.andM;To assess the quality of the 4045's LN03 emulation, we created a VMS testfile that was rich in the sort of escape sequences that LN03 printers use togenerate specific print characteristics.andP;  These included such attributes asunderlining, boldface, superscripts, subscripts and text justification, aswell as variations in font and pitch (type size).andP;  We printed the test fileon a DEC LN03 printer and a Xerox 4045 printer, and we then compared theoutput of both.andM;The 4045 performed well, but we did notice some minor differences (Fig.andP;  1).andO;When printing strike-out text, the Xerox printer used a broken linef the LN03used a continuous line.andM;We also encountered one obscure problem that will affect only purists.andP;  Weused escape sequences to assign graphic rendition (SGR) numbers to specificfont IDs.andP;  Generally, the Laser Science emulator ignores these assignmentcommands unless the assigned font corresponds to a font name that appears onthe 4045 configuration sheet.andM;This could be a potential problem for users who have created files that callon specific font-assignment sequences.andM;Our problem arose because we assigned the DEC LN03 13.6 point font to an SGRof 15.andP;  When we tried to print the font (with the assigned SGR value of 15),the printer was unable to print the correct font.andP;  In all fairness, this isnot a problem that most users would need to worry about.andM;Aside from these points, the printer performed well with the emulationcartridges.andP;  With the other font cartridges, the 4045 is capable of doingmuch of what an LN03 can.andM;Next, we tested the WPS-Plus printer table, which was supplied by the XeroxSoftware Library.andP;  Although the Laser Science emulation cartridges areintended to allow the Xerox printer to emulate an LN03 printer, the WPS-Plusprinter serves a more limited function.andP;  The printer table is intended onlyto support the printing of WPS-Plus documents on the Xerox printer.andM;We copied the WPS-Plus printer table files XEROX.PRA and XEROX.PRC to theappropriate WPSPLUS directory on the disk of a MicroVAX 3500 system.andP;  Wecreated a WPS-Plus document that included many WPS-specific commands andcontrol blocks, and then printed this document on an LN03 printer and theXerox unit.andM;We immediately encountered a problem.andP;  The printer table and the LN03emulation cartridges cannot be used simultaneously unless certainmodifications are made.andP;  This was not unexpected, and the reason for it isclear.andP;  The emulation cartridge intercepts data and translates it from theDEC LN03 format to the Xerox format.andM;When the WPS-Plus printer table is used, however, the data is already inXerox format.andP;  When the emulation cartridge receives the data, itunsuccessfully tries to translate it.andM;We were able to circumvent this problem in two ways.andP;  One way was simply toremove the cartridges from the printer.andP;  Although this is a straightforwardsolution, it is not necessarily the ideal one.andM;The other solution was to modify the WPS-Plus printer table so that allWPS-Plus documents destined for the Xerox printer were preceded with aninitialization sequence (found in the Laser Science manual) that &quot;disabled&quot;the emulator and put the printer in a Xerox 2700 emulation mode.andM;The Xerox Software Library also has several font cartridges that allow usersto generate most of the LN03's font and character sets.andP;  The printer tableperforms well and is almost transparent to users.andP;  When it is loaded with theappropriate font cartridges, the Xerox 4045 printer is able to emulate DEC'sLN03 virtually character-for-character.andM;There are some important differences, however.andP;  First, the WPS-Plus printertable is unable to handle certain composite characters like &quot;e&quot;.andP;  Anambitious user can fix this sort of minor flaw by modifying the printer tablethrough the WPS-Plus printer table utility.andM;In addition, the WPS-Plus printer table does not include the commands neededto let users switch between the Xerox printer's three print trays whileprinting.andP;  Xerox's technical support staff instructed us on how to add thenecessary commands to the printer table.andP;  Xerox plans to include thenecessary control block command in future releases of the WPS-Plus printertable.andM;There are some limitations to using this system in place of a DEC LN03.andP;  Themajor ones are that the Xerox printer cannot double-underline superscriptedor subscripted characters, that it does not yet support the DEC technicalcharacter set, and that it cannot place portrait-mode text and landscape-modetext on the same page.andM;There are also some differences between the Xerox printer using the WPS-Plusprinter table and a true DEC LN03.andP;  With the printer table, font changes mustbe specified when page orientation is changed; otherwise the Xerox printerwill default to its Titan 10-point font.andP;  On the LN03, the current font isretained, even after a page-orientation change.andP;  Also, when printing in alandscape orientation, the Xerox documents have a smaller left margin thanthe LN03 documents.andM;The WPS-Plus printer table does offer some advantages, however.andP;  Users areable to access Xerox's own fonts, such as Titan and XCP, which are notavailable on the LN03.andM;Also, the printer table supplies several WPS-Plus control block commandsunavailable on the LN03.andP;  These include PAGEBOX, which draws a box on thepage; MERGELOAD, which prepares the printer to store a page of data so thatit can be merged with later pages; MERGESTART, which prints the previouslystored information on the current page; and MERGESTOP, which terminates themerging of stored data.andM;The Xerox 4045 has a rated print speed of 10 pages per minute (ppm), comparedwith the LN03's rated speed of eight ppm.andP;  We submitted a 44-block, 13-pagefile to the Xerox printer.andP;  The printer took 59 seconds to receive the fileand 94 seconds to complete the printe job, which works out to just over eightppm (Fig.andP;  2).andP;  DR Labs' LN03 printer took 79 seconds to receive the documentand 118 seconds to print it, which works out to just over six ppm.andM;TRADE OFFSandM;Although the Xerox printer is faster than the LN03 and has a greaterpaper-handling capacity, it is also more expensive.andM;The printer (including the stacker/feeder attachment) is priced at $6,290.andO;The Laser Science emulation cartridge is priced at $495, and the fontcartridges are priced at $230 each.andM;Nevertheless, the printer does have some appeal.andP;  Using the emulationsolutions from Laser Science and Xerox, users can integrate the best featuresof DEC and Xerox printers.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
