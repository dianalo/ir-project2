<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-51-0754 </DOCNO><TEXT>The poloidal field coils of ASDEX Upgrade consist of 5 ohmic testing (OH)coils, 8 vertical field (V) coils, and 6 control (Co) coils. The conceptsof the coils were dominated by problems of positioning the coils withinlimited space as close as possible to the plasma, problems of high voltage(max. 30 kV) and high currents (max. 60 kA) giving current densitiesof max. 46.6 x 10/sup 6/ A/m/sup 2/, and heating and cooling problems.The results of several tests to measure the electrical and mechanicalproperties of the insulation are reported. Results of preliminary testsclarifying special manufacturing problems and the manufacturing methodsare described. Some fabrication steps are treated in detail: windingof the OH2 coils pancakes, joining of the pancakes, insulation and vacuumpressure impregnation, bending of the V1 coils (bending of conductors,crossovers, and conduits), construction of the cooling ducts.</TEXT></DOC>
