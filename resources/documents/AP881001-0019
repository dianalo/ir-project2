U.S. Secretary of State George P. Shultz quicklymade it clear that America was not about to follow suit.   British Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe announced the moveFriday after meeting with Iran's foreign minister, Ali AkhbarVelayati.   The action accelerated an improvement in Western relations withthe fundamentalist government in Tehran of Ayatollah RuhollahKhomeinei and Iran evidently wants to advance toward a more normalposition around the world.   Shultz told a news conference that any U.S. settlement with Iranrequired an end to the Iran-Iraq war, an end to terrorism and therelease of Americans believed held by pro-Iranian forces in Lebanon.   ``There is no change in the situation as far as the UnitedStates and Iran is concerned,'' he said.   Britain withdrew its diplomats from Tehran last year after aBritish envoy was beaten and kidnapped in apparent reprisal for thearrest of an Iranian consul in Manchester, England, on shopliftingcharges. The diplomat was released 24 hours later.   Britain and Iran did not break diplomatic relations, but tieswere badly strained and only the Iranian charge d'affaires wasallowed to stay in London.   On Friday, Iranian charge d'affaires Mohammad Basti said inLondon, ``Full diplomatic relations are to be restored and we hopeit will be at ambassadorial level.''   Friends of John McCarthy, an organization campaigning for therelease of one of Britain's hostages believed held by pro-Iranianguerrillas in Lenbanon, said in London that it welcomed Howe'sannouncement and ``hopes that the fate of John McCarthy, TerryWaite and Brian Keenan will be a top priority in the ongoingdiscussions between Iran and Britain.''   TV journalist McCarthy was kidnapped in Beirut on April 17, 1986.   Anglican Church envoy Terry Waite disappeared in Beirut Jan. 20,1987. No group has ever made a claim of responsibility in thatdisappearance.   Teacher Brian Keenan from Belfast in Northern Ireland, who hasdual British and Irish nationality, was seized in Lebanon on April11, 1986.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government has repeatedlyrefused to enter into bargaining for the release of Britishhostages.   In another development, Prime Minister Hussein Musavi of Irandenied a report Friday that said he tried to resign because foreignpolicy decisions, including support for operations such ashijackings, were made behind his back.   Musavi said the British Broadcasting Corp. report couldadversely affect efforts to normalize relations with Britain,according to the official Islamic Republic News Agency, monitoredin Cyprus.   IRNA quoted Musavi as saying he tried to resign in Augustbecause he dreaded a no-confidence vote against his new Cabinet inParliament. He withdrew the resignation after Khomeini sent him anopen letter calling it ``surprising.''   The BBC reported that Musavi had said he was resigning becausehis government was powerless and decisions were being taken thathad disastrous effects for Iran. The BBC cited confidential lettersbetween Musavi and President Ali Khamenei.   The BBC said the documents were leaked to members of the Majlis,or parliament, but it did not specify how they came out of Iran.   The documents, made available to The Associated Press in Cyprus,indicate deep divisions within the Iranian government.</TEXT></DOC>
