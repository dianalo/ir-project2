Irving promptly embraced the bid, hailing it as superior to a hostile $69-a-share bid from Bank of New York Co.    The revised bid would give Irving holders one warrant for every four shares of Irving. Each warrant would allow holders to buy one share of Irving for $65 over the next seven years. The warrants would be distributed prior to Banca Commerciale's purchase of Irving shares.    Since Banca Commerciale won't be able to exercise its tender offer until it has received federal regulatory approvals, the value of its offer is being discounted to &quot;not less than $79.50&quot; a share to reflect a purchase sometime in the fall, according to Irving.    The announcement was made after the stock market had closed. In the past, many investors and securities have been lukewarm about Banca Commerciale's bid, given the extra time needed for and uncertainties surrounding regulatory approvals.    In composite trading yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange, Irving shares closed at $71.375, up 12.5 cents. Bank of New York shares closed at $36.125, up $1.25.    Bank of New York responded to the Milan-based bank's latest offer -- which is valued at about $840 million -- by saying that it still doesn't equal the offer it proposed if Irving would agree to a friendly merger.    Bank of New York's hostile offer would give Irving holders $15 cash and 1.575 shares of its own stock, or about $72 a share, for each of the Irving shares that it doesn't already own. The total value of that offer would be about $1.32 billion. However, Bank of New York recently proposed increasing that offer to $15 cash, $5 a share in special dividends and 1.675 shares of its own stock, or about $80.50 a share, if Irving would drop its anti-takeover defenses and merge. Irving didn't accept or reject that offer, which is valued at $1.47 billion.    A Bank of New York spokesman said: &quot;Irving has said that the only reason that it has a poison pill as an anti-takeover defense is to promote an auction. Now they say the auction is over and yet they haven't removed it.&quot;    Banca Commerciale's offer is conditioned on Irving's poison pill remaining in place. A New York state judge is expected to rule today on the legality of the poison pill. Under the poison-pill provision, all Irving holders -- except for Bank of New York -- would be able to buy $400 of Irving shares for $200 once Bank of New York acquired a 20% stake. The effect would be to undermine Bank of New York's bid.    One area of uncertainty with respect to Banca Commerciale's offer is the warrants' value. Based on estimates of Irving's and the Italian concern's investment bankers, their value will be $2.75 to $7 each.    Arbitragers late yesterday questioned the $4-a-share average value placed by Irving on Banca Commerciale's warrants. One arbitrager who has signed a court affidavit in support of Bank of New York's offer said: &quot;I think the warrants will trade at $3. I think the Italian bank's new offer is worth about $75 to $76 a share today versus Bank of New York's, which I feel is worth about $80.50 a share. When Irving shares open for trading tomorrow, I think you're going to see the stock drop to $69.&quot;    Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., Bank of New York's investment banker, valued the warrants at 68 cents to $1.35 a share.    Felice Gelman, an analyst with Dillon Read andamp; Co., said: &quot;I think Bank of New York's offer is still more valuable to an Irving shareholder. Banca Commerciale's offer still has three big 'ifs': if they can get Federal Reserve Board approval, if Irving can pay a special dividend, and if the stocks and warrants trade at the values projected. It's interesting that Banca Commerciale has put soft money on the table -- a warrant -- instead of hard money, such as cash. It must point to the fact that Irving pushed hard for an increase in the offer from Banca Commerciale. But at this point I don't know what the warrant is worth.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
