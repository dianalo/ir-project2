By politicization it ismeant here that an issue-area - in our case, military defence of WesternEurope against the Soviet threat - gains a primary role on the politicalagenda of a country or a set of countries so that its content, limitsand rules are put into question. Two manifestations of such a politicizationwere, on the one hand, the vast mass mobilization across Western Europeagainst the NATO decision to deploy cruise and Pershing II missiles,and, on the other hand, the intense debate on defence and security posturesin Western Europe. The study of the evolution of an issue-area is affected,much more than in any other case, by the theoretical perspective theanalysis stems from. This is so because both domestic and internationalfactors, material and perceptual variables must be taken into account,in an attempt to link together different levels of analysis. In an attemptto single out and assess the relative weight domestic and internationalvariables have in the politicization of the security issue-area, theauthor uses a two-dimensional framework. Accordingly, the essay is articulatedas follows: first, a brief presentation of such a framework is offered;secondly, this framework is used to describe and explain the nature,characteristics and evolution of the security issue-area in Western Europe;thirdly, some conclusions are drawn upon the theoretical and methodologicalproblems this effort has raised.</TEXT></DOC>
