But financial services wasn't the first choice.    The company was a tangled mix of interests from ships and helicopters in the North Sea to office equipment, property and fund management. It also had just sold its 22% stake in Exco International PLC, the world's biggest money broker.    By March of this year, the picture looked very different. A 15-month shopping spree had added a stockbrokerage, a leasing company and a commodities trader. And the company had not only bought back its 22% stake in Exco, but the rest of Exco as well.    British andamp; Commonwealth Holdings PLC (it dropped &quot;Shipping&quot; after selling its last ship in October) now is steering a course to become Britain's biggest financial-services conglomerate. Capitalized at #1.8 billion ($2.96 billion), the company, known as Bandamp;C, seems set to attain that goal as it shifts its focus from investing. At the helm is 44-year-old John Gunn, who will relinquish the title of chief executive officer later this month for that of chairman.    &quot;We've sold a huge amount of stuff,&quot; says Mr. Gunn. &quot;The {new} shape of Bandamp;C will be a more-identifiable number of larger businesses.&quot;    In March, Mr. Gunn said Bandamp;C would gather all of its non-financial interests into a new holding company called Bricom PLC and then concentrate on financial services. Soon afterward, Bandamp;C announced it would build a #100 million ($163 million) investment bank.    That's the plan as it now stands. But some people doubt that Mr. Gunn will stick to it for long. &quot;He has a five-minute business plan, not a five-year business plan,&quot; says a former colleague at Exco, where Mr. Gunn was managing director for seven years.    It isn't clear that Mr. Gunn will bring any more to Bandamp;C than he did to Exco: a series of deals and investments in people that may or may not succeed. Exco ventured into some of the same areas that Bandamp;C is again exploring -- stock and commodity broking, banking -- and pulled out again. In the past few years, Exco &quot;looked at investment banking, corporate finance, leasing,&quot; says Richard Lacy, Exco's chairman. &quot;We didn't find anything better than our {own} business.&quot;    Mr. Quigley credits Mr. Gunn for Exco's decision to sell 52% of the communications company Telerate Inc. to Dow Jones andamp; Co. (publisher of, among other things, this newspaper) and Oklahoma Publishing Co. in August 1985, just as the industry started to boom. The move brought Exco a #160 million hoard of cash.    But the sale also led to Mr. Gunn's resignation from Exco in October 1985 when his plans for using the profits from the transaction clashed with the board's.    Board members won't say much about the dispute, but a former Exco colleague says Mr. Gunn steered Exco and its Gartmore Investment Management Ltd. subsidiary into high-technology investments in California that gave them a loss of about #13 million.    Mr. Gunn has said of the incident, &quot;The pace I was setting {at Exco} was too wide and too quick and I was outvoted repeatedly&quot; by Exco's board.    Born in Cheshire, the son of a railway man, Mr. Gunn spent four years in banking training with Barclays Bank Ltd. before he joined the money broker Astley andamp; Pearce in 1968.    In 1979, he and eight colleagues bought Astley andamp; Pearce. The company acquired another money broker, Godsell andamp; Co., in 1980 and went public under the Exco name a year later. Subsequent purchases and minority investments built Exco into the world's biggest money broker.    Mr. Gunn has an ability to find the right people and put them to work in the right situations, his associates say. He tries to &quot;find something emerging, put money behind it, get someone to run it, then clean up,&quot; says Rod Barrett, an analyst with the stockbrokerage Hoare Govett.    Mr. Gunn's planned investment bank is typical. Bruce Ursell and Malcolm Wilde, senior executives of the merchant bank Guinness Mahon andamp; Co., sought Bandamp;C's backing in February to launch the venture. The two bankers plan to repeat the business they developed at Guinness Mahon: film and property finance and syndicated lending to local government bodies. They also want to link private clients of Bandamp;C's regional stockbroker to a regional private banking network.    Analysts could be disappointed if they expect Bandamp;C to restructure its financial-services interests into a well-managed whole. &quot;Nothing has been done with synergy in mind,&quot; says Mr. Gunn. There are plenty of overlaps, and they're likely to remain, he says.    The chance to buy back Exco, now a jewel in Bandamp;C's crown, came out of the blue in November. When Mr. Gunn joined Bandamp;C's board in October 1985, the conglomerate arranged to sell its Exco stake to the Kuwait Investment Office, a Kuwait government investment fund. The Kuwaitis held the stake for only 12 hours before selling it to the Malaysian financier Khoo Teck Puat. Last fall, Tan Sri Khoo started to look for a buyer after the Brunei government seized the Khoo family's National Bank of Brunei.    Acquiring the company that had previously forced him out was seen by some as sweet revenge and by others as a settling of scores. &quot;What did John Gunn come back to?&quot; Mr. Lacy, Exco's chief executive, asks rhetorically. &quot;The business he knows.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
