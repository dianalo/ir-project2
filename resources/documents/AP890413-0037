Kennedy said Wednesday night after his proposal to raisethe hourly minimum wage from $3.35 to $4.55 by October 1991 clearedthe Senate on a 62-37 vote.   ``If that's not the case, we'll see the president and those whosupport the president's position at the polls,'' said Kennedy,D-Mass.   There are some differences between the Kennedy bill andlegislation already passed by the House. A conference committee wasexpected to be named today to draft a compromise.   Kennedy, without being specific, said he was open to compromisewith the White House during the conference stage. But the prospectsfor such an overture from Bush appear highly unlikely. Bushrepeatedly has said his proposal to raise the minimum wage to $4.25by January 1992, rejected in both the House and the Senate, was hislast.   ``I have it on pretty good authority that it's not going to behigher than $4.25,'' said Senate Minority Leader Robert Dole,husband of Labor Secretary Elizabeth Dole.   The final bill could be considered as early as next week,although no timetable has been set. The Democratic leadership hasthe votes to win final passage, but Bush appears to have more thanenough votes to sustain a veto.   Ten Republicans joined 52 Democrats in supporting the Senatebill, while two Democrats and 35 Republicans voted against it. Theonly senator not voting was Albert Gore Jr., D-Tenn.   A renewed campaign to get the president to change his mind beganjust after the vote.   ``I urge the president to sign it when it reaches his desk,''AFL-CIO President Lane Kirkland said in a statement. ``A veto wouldonly compound the inequities faced by America's lowest-paid workerswho have gone eight years without a pay raise.''   But Republicans, noting a number of other Democrat-sponsoreddomestic programs likely to emerge from Congress over GOPobjections, said it was time for Bush to prove he will stand hisground.   ``Everyone knows the whole ballgame rests on the presidentialveto,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah. He said few presidents havehad to control Congress through repeated vetoes but added, ``Isuspect this president is going to have to do that.''   Under the Democrats' plan, the minimum wage, frozen at $3.35since 1981, would rise to $3.85 on Oct.1, to $4.25 on Oct. 1, 1990,and to $4.55 a year later.   Bush has said he would veto any bill to raise the minimum wageto more than $4.25 an hour and has insisted legislation must alsoallow employers to pay all new workers a subminimum wage for up tosix months.   Republicans argue the ``training wage'' is necessary to preventmassive job losses they contend would be caused by the higherminimum wage. Democrats have disputed the job-loss predictions, butincluded in their measures a provision allowing employers to paysome new workers a lower scale for up to two months.</TEXT></DOC>
