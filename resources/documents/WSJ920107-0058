Output reached 24 million barrels a day in December and isexceeding that level this month, according to estimates bymonitors of OPEC's production. With world oil demand stillsluggish, analysts say, such a rate is putting pressure on analready-soft oil market.</LP><TEXT>   It is also adding to fears among some OPEC members that anoil glut -- and a possible price crash -- may be just aroundthe corner. Some OPEC members are trimming revenue estimatessharply.   Yesterday, President Suharto of Indonesia presented adraft budget for his government's fiscal year, which beginsApril 1, that calls for an oil price of only $17 a barrel vs.the $19 used for the current year's budget. The Indonesianpresident cited &quot;the uncertain oil market in the forthcomingfiscal year.&quot;   Because of the high quality of its crudes, Indonesia's oilprices usually are above the average of the basket of sevencrudes used by OPEC as a pricing yardstick. OPEC's referenceprice for the basket is $21 a barrel, but that was touchedonly briefly last fall. Since then the basket average hassunk to nearly $16 a barrel.   Indicative of the alarm of some in OPEC, a senior Iraniangovernment official used the harshest term yet in criticizingthe high output of some fellow OPEC members. At a Tehran newsconference yesterday, he called it &quot;treason&quot; against &quot;futuregenerations.&quot;   The Iranian official accused some producers of trying toglut the market. He didn't name the offending countries. Butthe Iranian government's news agency quoted him as sayingthat Iran was in touch with Saudi Arabia about the marketsituation.   Iran was among those countries increasing production inthe wake of the 1990-91 Persian Gulf crisis that removed Iraqand Kuwait from the oil-export picture. But Saudi Arabia,Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates increased productionthe most after Iraq invaded Kuwait to begin the crisis.   Saudi Arabia's output has climbed more than three millionbarrels a day above the 5.4 million it produced under the oldquota system that OPEC scrapped after the Persian Gulf crisisbegan. As a result, several other OPEC members, includingAlgeria, Nigeria and Indonesia, have suggested Saudi Arabiashould be one of the first to consider cutting production toprop up deteriorating oil prices.   So far, the kingdom has maintained that its currentproduction is its rightful share of the oil market. Saudi oilofficials have suggested they will reduce output only if all13 members of OPEC share in the cuts. Also, they haveresisted calls for an emergency meeting of OPEC to discussnew production quotas.   The kingdom's oil officials have maintained that the priceof oil will rise again but that this should be left to marketforces. Meanwhile, according to Dow Jones InternationalPetroleum Report, Saudi Arabia has effectively cut the pricescharged large European and U.S. contract buyers of itslighter-grade crudes by 10 cents to 25 cents a barrel forFebruary deliveries.   &quot;As the first full week of 1992 trading begins, SaudiArabia is keeping downward pressure on an already soft oilmarket by dropping the price of lighter crudes sold into thekey European and U.S. markets for the second month running,&quot;reported the London-based Energy Compass.   There is no central counting point for production byOPEC's 13 members, and estimates by outside monitors vary.However, according to most estimates, OPEC production was uplast year to the highest level since 1980. Such oil industrypublications as Petroleum Argus and Petroleum IntelligenceWeekly place the 1991 average at around 23.3 million barrelsa day. They also agree that output was above 24 million inDecember.   Cristina Haus, who tracks OPEC production for theWashington-based Energy Security Analysis, estimated Decemberoutput at 24.3 million barrels a day. For OPEC, she added,&quot;things can only get worse.&quot; Winter, the peak demand periodfor oil, will soon be over, she noted, &quot;and then it will haveto worry about Iraq and Kuwait.&quot;   Production by Kuwait is rebounding faster than had beenexpected, although it isn't a significant factor in theexport picture yet. The Iraqi export situation is alsouncertain. Iraq is still banned by the United Nations fromexporting oil. The U.N. has proposed an emergency sale of$1.6 billion in Iraqi oil, but Iraqi officials have rejectedthe terms. However, Iraqi and U.N. representatives are tomeet in Vienna tomorrow to discuss it.</TEXT></DOC>
