The 5-3 ruling affects the rights of some 500,000 federal workers, including 17,000 government lawyers, according to statistics compiled by the federal Office of Personnel Management. That is about 23% of the federal government work force.    The decision, written by Justice Antonin Scalia, said that when Congress overhauled the civil service system in 1978, the lawmakers spelled out the only categories of federal workers who may challenge personnel decisions outside their own agencies.    The high court said that Congress gave employees who obtained their jobs through competitive civil service exams the right to contest personnel actions before a special panel called the Merit Systems Protection Board and the right to appeal the board's decisions to a special federal appeals court. Because Congress didn't specifically extend a similar right to other workers, unless they were military veterans, the court said such challenges aren't allowed. Once these workers have exhausted their appeals within their agencies they have no further recourse.    In dissent, Justice John Stevens, joined by Justices William Brennan and Thurgood Marshall, said that workers hired non-competitively could challenge adverse personnel actions before the 1978 law and that Congress hadn't eliminated the right.    The case involved a worker who was fired from an Interior Department Fish and Wildlife Service camp in Virginia Beach, Va., for alleged misuse of a government vehicle. Interior Department officials later changed the firing to a suspension with partial back pay restored, but the worker went to court to challenge the suspension. A federal appeals court here agreed with the worker, but the high court yesterday reversed that decision. </TEXT></DOC>
