Lebanese-born defendant Omar Mohammed Ali Rezaq, 25, pleadedguilty to seven of nine charges when his trial opened in a heavilyguarded courtroom.   The state dropped the two remaining, lesser charges of firearmsuse and violation of Maltese airspace to speed up the trial. JudgeWallace Gulia is expected to announce the verdict Wednesday.   Rezaq was one of three Palestinian gunmen who commandeered anEgyptair Boeing 737 flying the Athens-Cairo route on Nov. 23, 1985.   Sixty people, including the two other Palestinian air pirates,died in the hijacking and the storming of the plane by Egyptiansoldiers.   Rezaq pleaded guilty to killing Scarlet Maria Rogenkamp, ofOceanside, Calif.,. and Nitzan Mendelson, an Israeli woman. He haddenied the charges in pre-trial testimony.   The two women were forced to go to the doorway of the plane afterJewish and American passengers were singled out. The women were shotand thrown from the plane to the tarmac.   Conviction on the murder and hijacking charges could mean a lifeimprisonment sentence, Malta's stiffest criminal penalty, for Rezaq.   Rezaq, born in the Sabra refugee camp in Beirut, testified thatthe hijacking was ``an act against Egypt's political system, an actagainst Egypt's policy which was destroying the future of thePalestinians.''   Rezaq, wearing a dark suit and a white shirt unbuttoned at theneck, said the hijackers had to land in Malta because the plane didnot have enough fuel to go elsewhere.   ``We came to Malta in transit,'' he said while making a plea ofmitigating circumstances. ``What happened in Malta was anaccident,'' .   Rezaq said the hijackers had intended to fly to an Arab country,which he declined to identify.   Asked why the hijackers had fired at Israelis, Rezaq said, ``Thisis our principle.'' He said they fired at Americans ``because theyare imperialists ... and there are other reasons too.''   Eyptian soldiers attacked the plane with gunfire and high-poweredexplosives.   Most of the victims died from smoke inhalation in a fire touchedoff by an explosion, which a Maltese investigation said appeared tocome after a hijacker tossed a grenade at Egyptian soldiers.   Two victims were killed by gunfire from the Egyptians,investigators found.</TEXT></DOC>
