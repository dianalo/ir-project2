David M. Blitzer, chief economist at Sandamp;P, said the sharpgains will &quot;reflect numerous large write-offs anticipated inthe closing quarter of 1991 plus a better economy in 1992. Inthe last several weeks we have seen a number of firmsannouncing large write-offs to be included in 1991 results.Our analysts expect this to depress 1991 earnings but to makefor some easier comparisons next year.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Earnings for health care and drug companies in the Sandamp;P500-stock index are expected to gain 17% in 1991 and remainsteady at 15% to 17% growth in 1992. Sandamp;P said this industryhas a recession-proof market, favorable long-term trends suchas demographics, and a steady flow of new products fromresearch and development.   Earnings for banks should rise 8% this year to $18 billionfrom 1990's $16.6 billion, while 1992 profits should rise 12%to about $20 billion. Lower loss provisions and continuedconsolidation are expected next year, Sandamp;P said. RichardLevine, a banking analyst with Sandamp;P, said the question facingbanks in the early 1990s is &quot;whether it is better to haveloaned than to have never loaned at all.&quot; Savings and loaninstitutions, after undergoing major changes and shifts inthe last few years, should see a 34% earnings gain this yearand an 11% increase in 1992. Sandamp;P said 1991 and 1992 earningswill be helped by reduced reserve additions and widerinterest rate margins.   Despite fears about Christmas sales, retailers as a groupshould see a 12% earnings gain this year and a 20% gain in1992, due to lean inventories and aggressive cost controls,Sandamp;P said.   The auto industry is expected to show losses of $6.7billion this year, excluding the restructuring chargesannounced by General Motors Corp. this month. Additionally,GM, Ford Motor Co. and Chrysler Corp. need to take chargesthis year or next year for accrued retiree health benefits,which could total $30 billion, Sandamp;P said. If the economyresponds, though, auto makers could return to significantprofitability -- possibly $2 billion in earnings in 1992, Sandamp;Padded.   Earnings for oil companies are expected to dip 10% in 1991and then rebound by about 12% in 1992, as the companies movebeyond 1991 restructuring charges and refining and marketingmargins widen. Nonetheless, Sandamp;P expects oil prices to slip toabout $15 a barrel next year from $17 this year.   The electric utility industry will see earnings rise about10% this year and 5% in 1992. The 1991 gain is due to a smallincrease in kilowatt-hour sales and fewer write-offs, whichwere partly offset by lower construction credits.   The steel industry is expected to turn around in 1992 andearn about $1 billion following an expected $1.5 billion lossthis year. The paper industry is expected to stage a strongcomeback in 1992, with a 30% earnings rise next year after an18% decrease this year. The computer industry will seeoperating profits slip 2% this year, though a rebound inworld-wide economic activity, significant cost cutting andrestructuring and new products should push profits up nextyear by 12%.</TEXT></DOC>
