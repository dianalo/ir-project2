(technical)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Boogaard, Jerry.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Lasers are emerging as key tools in many aspects of semiconductorfabrication, due to the continuing miniaturization of circuitgeometries.andP;  The lasers' precision makes them ideal for suchapplications as memory repair and programming ofapplication-specific integrated circuits (ASICs).andP;  It has beennecessary to refine lasers considerably to keep pace with theshrinking size of circuits.andP;  Improved pulse-to-pulse stability andpower control precision enable the standard Nd:YAG laser to remainthe primary repair tool even on 1M-bit to 4M-bit chips withsubmicron link geometries.andP;  Lasers are also used for ASIClink-cutting and to trim components to value.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     LasersSemiconductor Production EquipmentApplication-Specific Integrated CircuitsIntegrated CircuitsSemiconductor IndustryCircuit Components.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotograph.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
