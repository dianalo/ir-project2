Indonesia's Subroto also said that OPEC had no confirmation ofpublished reports that the United Arab Emirates was exceeding itsproduction quota agreed upon at an OPEC meeting last November.   The January meeting will include representatives of the 13-membercartel, but not necessarily the countries' oil ministers, Subrotoindicated to reporters after meeting with Egypt oil ministerAbdel-Hady Kandil.   The Indonesian minister, who arrived in Cairo Sunday night, istouring non-OPEC oil-producing countries, and already has visitedColombia and Mexico. He is to depart Wednesday for Oman.   Subroto said his purpose is to determine ``what OPEC and non-OPEC(nations) can do together.''   Subroto and Kandil said that non-OPEC oil-producing countrieswill hold a meeting of their own in London Jan. 25 at Oman'srequest. Then, experts from OPEC and non-OPEC countries would meetthe following day to prepare the ground for a ministerial meetinglater, he said.   ``We discussed cooperation and what we shall do together to bringstability in the oil market,'' Subroto said of his talks withKandil. ``Certainly one aspect of that cooperation is how toinfluence supply, and OPEC has done its part already by the Novemberagreement to reduce production and I think it is now time thatnon-OPEC producers will also contribute.''   Kandil however, ruled out any further reduction of Egypt'sproduction. He said that since October 1984, Egypt had reduced itsdaily output in support of OPEC policies.   Egypt is not a member of OPEC but its oil policy is generallyguided by the cartel's actions.   Subroto said that OPEC's eight-minister monitoring committee hasclosely followed each member's output, looking for possibleviolations of quotas. Asked about published reports that the UnitedArab Emirates was exceeding its quota, Subroto said there was noevidence to support such a claim.   Subroto said that world oil prices were ``developing very muchpositively'' thanks to observance of last November's OPEC quotas andcooperation between OPEC and non-OPEC producers.   OPEC agreed late last year to reduce its oil output to 18.5million barrels a day from more than 22 million barrels startingJan. 1. Since the agreement, world oil prices have risen steadilyfrom around the $12-$13-a-barrel range to the $16-$17 range.   The new quota is to remain in effect for six months.</TEXT></DOC>
