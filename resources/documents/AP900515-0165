Demjanjuk's Israeli defense attorney, Yoram Sheftel, alsoaccused the trial's three judges of failing to halt a spate ofnegative press coverage and said some of the articles publishedwere tantamount to ``bloodletting.''   The Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk, 70, was pronounced guilty in April1988 of crimes against humanity after he was identified as a cruelguard known as ``Ivan the Terrible'' at the Treblinka death camp inPoland. More than 850,000 Jews were slaughtered at the camp duringWorld War II.   Demjanjuk, who was extradited from Cleveland in February 1986,claims he is the victim of mistaken identity. He said he wascaptured while serving in the Soviet army and spent the period inquestion in a German prisoner-of-war camp.   On Tuesday, Sheftel challenged two key photograph lineups usedto help eight Treblinka survivors identify Demjanjuk as thenotorious camp guard.   One lineup contains the 1951 picture Demjanjuk used on hisapplication for a U.S. immigration visa. The other picture is froma 1942 identity card the Soviet Union supplied to Israel. It ispurported to be from the Trawniki camp in Poland, which traineddeath camp guards.   Sheftel said Demjanjuk was never called for an in-person lineup,despite Israeli and U.S. rulings saying a suspect shouldparticipate in person in criminal indentification procedures.   Sheftel also said none of the head shots resembled the accused.He said the hair color, shape and size of faces were clearlydifferent.   ``It is like putting a photograph of a black suspect among sevenwhite men. Where have you heard of such a thing?'' Sheftel said.   Sheftel also noted one of the lineups was deemed inadmissible bythe U.S. Southern District Court in Florida in 1978 in a caseinvolving another accused war criminal, Feodor Fedorenko.Demjanjuk's picture appeared alongside Fedorenko's in the display.   The U.S. court ruled Fedorenko's picture was ``impermissivelysuggestive,'' because it was larger and clearer than the others,Sheftel said.   ``There's no doubt that Demjanjuk's photograph is 10 times moreimpermissively suggestive,'' Sheftel added. ``But this court neverbothered to rule on whether this picture was suggestive.''   Sheftel also accused the judges of bias. He said Chief JusticeDov Levine told the Cleveland Plain Dealer in an interviewpublished in May 1988 that ``innocence must be proven.'' He notedthis contradicted the legal principle that a suspect is innocentunless proven guilty.   Sheftel also crticized the judges for the emotional atmospheresurrounding the federal trial. He cited the Dec. 1, 1988, incidentin which a Holocaust survivor threw acid in his face at a funeral,injuring an eye.   Sheftel, who still wears dark glasses because of the attack,said it followed a series of inciteful press accounts of the trial.He cited an article that questioned his credibility and Jewishnessfor defending an alleged Nazi war criminal.   ``This was a bloodletting report,'' Sheftel said. But, he added,``the court didn't intercede or say anything.''   Demjanjuk, wearing a brown prison uniform, listened intently toa Ukrainian traslation of the proceedings. His wife Vera and sonJohn Jr. also watched.   John Jr. said he believes his father will only walk free if thejudges ``have the courage to make a decision based on the facts andthe law.''</TEXT></DOC>
