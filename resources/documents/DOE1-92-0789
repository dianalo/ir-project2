Power densities were calculated fromthe energy spectrum at 2.52 GeV. Ozone concentrations in small beam pipeswere measures for power densities (I) between 10{sup 12} and 10{sup 15}eV{center_dot}cm{sup -3}{center_dot}sec{sup -1}. Large departures ofthe G-value describing ozone formation and k describing ozone destructionfrom previously published values suggest that some undiscovered systematicerror may exist in the experiment. This error may be related to beamhating effects and lack of uniform distribution of ozone within the sampledbeam pipes. 19 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
