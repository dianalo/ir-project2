Such traders might be excused for concluding that nobodywins consistently in futures markets. But they're wrong.Professional money managers known as commodity tradingadvisers -- people who trade full time for themselves and forothers through private accounts or pooled investments -- earnprofits steadily in these fast-moving, risky markets.</LP><TEXT>   Burlington Hall Asset Management Inc. of Hackettstown,N.J., found that about 80% of the advisers in its data basewere profitable each year from 1981 to 1990 and that theaverage return for all advisers in this period was 35%annually. Burlington Hall tracked 219 advisers last year, upfrom only 42 a decade earlier.   These are the people against whom the &quot;hey-I-can-do-that&quot;amateur investors must compete. Commodities are whateconomists call a &quot;zero-sum&quot; market, which means that forevery dollar made there is one lost. Zero-sum doesn't imply,as many mistakenly believe, that for every investor who wins,one loses. If that were true, half the people in a market atany one time would make a profit -- and not that manyactually do so.   In practice, commodity markets really are slightly&quot;negative sum&quot; -- for every dollar won, a bit more than adollar is lost -- because of commissions and othertransaction costs.   It's no surprise, then, that three of every fourindividual investors who wander into futures markets arelosers. Lind-Waldock Corp., the largest discount commoditybroker in the U.S., recently disclosed that about 25% of its13,000-plus customers made money in the three years through1990. The Lind-Waldock customers who traded frequently -- asmeasured by high commission totals -- did substantiallybetter than those whose few trades generated commissions ofless than $500 a year.   By contrast, nearly 92% of the commodity trading advisersfollowed by Burlington Hall made a profit in 1987, which wasthe best year of the past 10. In the worst year, 1989, about60% had a positive return.   Critics of these data argue that they reflect only therecords of trading advisers good enough to have survived for10 years. The 35% average annual returns that tempt investorsdon't include results of advisers who were wiped out, theycomplain.   Burlington Hall says that of the 42 advisers it followedin 1981, 35 were still trading for others in 1990 and allshowed a positive rate of return over that period. The mostsuccessful adviser in this group had a 36.5% annual compoundrate of return, while the least profitable showed only a 0.7%annual compound gain.   Millburn Ridgefield Corp.'s currency futures program hadthe highest compounded 10-year rate of return among thosefollowed by Burlington. George Crapple, vice chairman of theinvestment concern, says professional traders have anunbeatable long-term advantage in that they are able to callon years of experience or sophisticated decision-makingsystems that the vast majority of individual traders don'thave.   Bo Thunman, editor of Club 3000 News, a newsletter oftraders who mostly use computers to help them trade, says,&quot;It's like being an airline pilot in that you have to do itall the time in order to succeed.&quot;   Robert Hickey, president of Hickey Financial ServicesInc., which has about $80 million under management, says mostindividual traders couldn't do the kind of trading hiscompany does. His company specializes in trading financialinstruments in both futures and cash markets, and anindividual would have to have a net worth of at least $25million to do business with a primary government bond dealer.   Though Mr. Hickey hasn't had a losing year in the past 10,his clients saw their returns drop to about 7% a year in 1989and 1990 as the financial markets became more efficient. Hisfirm's approach is to exploit distortions or inefficienciesin the market. &quot;We simply try to grind it {a steady return}out year by year,&quot; he says.   Many individual investors, on the other hand, take flingsin the commodity markets for &quot;cocktail party conversation,&quot;says Lyle Latvala, president of Market Timers, a Gainesville,Ga., brokerage company. The company specializes in tradingthe recommendations of newsletters and hotlines for customerswho don't have time to follow the markets themselves. He saysindividuals tend to be too focused on potential short-termpayoffs -- which he says is why, when they are presented witha choice of trades, they frequently pick one that loses.&quot;They have no planned program,&quot; he says.   Looking ahead to commodity markets this week:                                                                                                          Grains and Soybeans                                                                                                          Traders this week will be awaiting conclusive word on theSoviet Union's request for about $1.5 billion in export bonuscredits to buy U.S. grain. President Bush's indication Fridaythat he was leaning toward granting credits set off a mildrally in grain futures prices. A final agreement on thecredits would push futures prices higher.   Also important to futures trading this week will beforecasts of hot weather in the Midwest. A 90-day forecastlast week called for extended periods of heat ingrain-growing states, raising fears of damage to corn andsoybean crops. Friday, a six-to-10-day forecast called forunseasonably high temperatures in the western Plains.Continued forecasts of hot weather would be expected to exertupward pressure on grain futures prices, said Daniel Basse,director of market research for AgResource Co., Chicago.                                                                                                          Energy                                                                                                          A recurring explanation for last week's lacklusterpetroleum futures activity on the New York MercantileExchange was that traders were leery of doing much ahead ofthis week's meeting of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries. However, several sources, including someof the cartel's oil ministers, are saying they don't expectmuch from the gathering.   With Kuwait and Iraq, for physical and political reasons,still months away from export production, severalOPEC-watchers expect little to come out of the meeting onissues such as production quotas and pricing strategies. Manyministers are calling for the group to maintain its currentproduction of about 22.3 million barrels a day at leastthrough the third quarter, even though demand is expected torise.                                                                                                          Precious Metals                                                                                                          Trading in platinum calmed down Friday as tradersrecovered from &quot;Nissan shock.&quot; Nissan Motor Co. announcedThursday it had developed an automobile catalytic converterthat uses palladium instead of platinum and rhodium.   After diving $20.50 an ounce Thursday, platinum for Julydelivery rose $1.10 to $377.80 an ounce. September palladium,which was up the $6-an-ounce limit Thursday, fell $1.65 to$98.10.   Platinum trading was quiet Friday, said Frank Reddon,manager of precious metals trading at Johnson Matthey. Therewas light buying by industrial companies that use platinum intheir manufacturing processes, he said.   If there aren't any further developments on Nissan's news,prices will probably stabilize around current levels, saidJeffrey Nichols, president of American Precious MetalsAdvisors, a Boca Raton, Fla., consultant.   The Nissan news again reminded investors that a major useof platinum is vulnerable to technological change, he said.That will discourage investment demand in the future, hesaid, just as a similar announcement by Ford Motor Co. did in1988. &quot;It's like a second knockout blow,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
