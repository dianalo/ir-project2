The way it looks now we may get a littlefrom it, but not much,'' said Edmund Manning of the Central PacificHurricane Center here. ``But then you can't be too optimistic.''   At 2 p.m. HST Monday, the hurricane was 630 miles east-southeastof Hawaii Island, southernmost in the chain, moving west at 20 mph,Manning said. Its maximum sustained wind speed was 75 mph; a stormis classified a hurricane when that speed reaches 74 mph. Windgusted up to 90 mph.   At that speed and course, the hurricane was expected to passsouth of Hawaii Island, the ``Big Island,'' on Tuesday night.However, the center said a slight change in direction would bringthe hurricane closer to the state.   A tropical storm watch was issued for the island at 5 p.m. HST,which means winds up to 73 mph, large waves and heavy rains mighthit the island, the center said.   An Air Force reconaissance plane from Keesler Air Force Base inBiloxi, Miss., was scheduled to fly through the storm Tuesday tocollect data on its intensity and direction, said Clarence Lee, headof the hurricane center.   The last major storm to hit Hawaii was Hurricane Iwa, whichbrushed the island of Oahu and roared over the top of Kauai withwinds up to 117 mph in November 1982, causing $234 million damage.   Manning said it was too early to predict with certainty howDalilia would affect Hawaii's weather.   ``A lot depends on how close Dalilia moves to the Islands,'' hesaid. ``Some increase in showers and winds will likely result,especially on the Big Island. There will also be some surf.''   Manning said wave action associated with a fast-moving hurricanelike Dalilia tends to bunch up and arrive close to the passage ofthe center. Surf on Hawaii Island's southern beaches was notexpected to increase until midday Tuesday, he said.   Harry Kim, Hawaii County Civil Defense administrator, called abriefing Monday with Hawaii Island agencies responsible formonitoring surf. ``At this time, it seems like the worst we willhave is surf problems,'' Kim said.</TEXT></DOC>
