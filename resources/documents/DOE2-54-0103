The effective indicesof guided TE- and TM-modes are measured for red, green, and blue light.The refractive index profiles are reconstructed by a new reliable inverseWKB procedure. Despite of widely differing profiles there is, for eachwavelength, a one to one relationship between the changes {Delta}n/subo/ of the ordinary and {Delta}n/sub e/ of the extraordinary refractiveindex. For low and for high refractive index changes {Delta}n/sub e/and {Delta}n/sub o/ grow proportionally, but their ratios differ appreciably.The results support recent findings that the LiNbO/sub 3/:Ti system existsin two distinct phases.</TEXT></DOC>
