Effects of the following factors on wearand corrosion are analyzed: friction, physical properties of coal andmine stones mixed with coal, chemical composition of water used for coalpreparation, emission of aggressive gases that cause corrosion of metalstructures, vapors and gases emitted from coal dryers. Methods for wearcontrol and increasing equipment service life are comparatively evaluated:use of steel alloys with increased abrasion resistance, use of polycrystallinesilicon carbide instead of steels (increases service life of variouselements of separation equipment by about 10 times), use of new materials(on glass basis), stone castings, liners made of slags and other materials,polyurethanes, rubbers. Types of coatings, enamels and paints used forcorrosion protection in the USSR are comparatively evaluated: polyethylene,polypropylene, PVC, fluoroplastic. Efficiency of various types of corrosionprotection is investigated. Selected types of corrosion protection usedin the European Communities are also described. 13 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
