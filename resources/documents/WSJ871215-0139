The group was formed by the Amalgamated Clothing and Textile Workers Union and the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners, which control 60,000 of Echlin's 55.6 million shares outstanding.    As previously reported, the committee's proxy statement lists three resolutions the group will seek to get adopted at a shareholder meeting Dec. 22. The group is urging Echlin's board to study health problems and legal liabilities posed by the company's use of asbestos; to suspend further acquisitions of stock of Raytech Corp., whose Raymark Industries Inc. unit has been named in thousands of asbestos-related lawsuits; and to repeal a bylaw provision allowing the board to amend the bylaws unilaterally.    A spokesman for Echlin, a maker of motor vehicle replacement parts, including brake shoes with asbestos, called the resolutions &quot;redundant.&quot; He said the company has already taken actions, including closing certain operations, to protect its workers. In regard to the board's power to amend bylaws, he said, &quot;It's normal corporate practice to have that power.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
