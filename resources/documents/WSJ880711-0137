The suspension Friday underlined the controversy about recruitment tactics, especially the use of &quot;no strike&quot; deals, among U.K. unions, which are trying to reverse a membership slump.    The unions have lost three million members since Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was first elected in 1979, reversing the gradual expansion in union membership since World War II. The labor movement has been hit by recession in the old labor-intensive industries, tough new industrial-relations legislation and a growing trend toward non-union labor.    The suspended union, the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications andamp; Plumbing Union, has gone furthest in trying to attract new members by accepting single union, strike-free deals, especially from companies setting up high technology ventures in Britain at new sites.    The union has &quot;a totally different approach to industrial relations,&quot; says David Metcalf, a researcher at the London School of Economics. &quot;They are basically co-operative with employers rather than adversarial. More and more employers will be attracted to the electricians,&quot; he adds.    Despite the fact the electricians' members represent about 4% of the total congress, their approach gives them &quot;a significance totally out of proportion to their numbers,&quot; Mr. Metcalf says.    Although other unions are adopting similar tactics, the electricians' union has been suspended because of complaints that it is using the new type of deal to &quot;poach&quot; other unions' members.    In the intense battle for membership, more and more unions are prepared to take part in &quot;beauty contests,&quot; where they compete for sole recognition from an employer by offering concessions on the terms of a union agreement. The ultimate concession tends to be a no-strike pledge.    Divisions over single union deals surfaced in March, when Ford Motor Co. pulled out of plans to build a #40 million ($68.5 million) high-technology plant in a depressed area of Scotland. Ford had signed a single union deal with the Amalgamated Engineering Union, but other unions representing Ford workers in Britain refused to sanction the single-union deal.    The congress, which defines overall tactics for member unions, suspended the electricians after they failed to respond to a Thursday deadline to pull out of two such deals.    The suspension likely will accelerate inter-union warfare, as the electricians step up their recruitment drive at new sites, while other unions try to grab electricians' members in factories where they represent the minority, Mr. Metcalfe says. Depending on the success of the electricians' tactics, other unions may follow them out of the congress.    For employers setting up new plants, the trend toward single union deals with no-strike clauses is welcome. But at existing plants with large multi-union membership, the prospect of disruption caused by inter-union warfare after the suspension is also worrying. But many observers expect limited implications for employers.    &quot;It's a long time since an employer in this country has changed his plans because of the unions,&quot; said a representative of one British employers group who asked not to be named.    &quot;In the unionized sector of the labor market, what employers want is still order and stability,&quot; says Bill Daniel, director of the Policy Studies Insitute, an independent research body. &quot;It's only at the margins where there's competition for members.&quot;    The congress says it isn't opposed to no-strike deals or single union deals in principle. &quot;There's nothing wrong with no-strike deals in themselves,&quot; says a congress spokesman. &quot;But the deals shouldn't be touted around at new workplaces by the unions to attract an employer to them rather than another union.&quot;    The congress also says it was forced to suspend the electricians' union because it refused to accept the congress' disputes procedures, which are supposed to prevent raids on union membership. Other unions have signed similar deals with employers, but none has refused to accept the congress as final arbiter, the congress says.    Congress General Secretary Norman Willis says, the leaders of the electricians' union &quot;forced other unions to play by the rules when it favored them. Now they're refusing to do so when a couple of decisions have gone against them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
