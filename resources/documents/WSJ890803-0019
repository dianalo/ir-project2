It didn't estimate the loss and company officials couldn't be reached for comment. The assets are primarily fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities and long-term, low-yielding bonds.    A year earlier, SFFed had earnings of $4.3 million, or 55 cents a share.    The San Francisco thrift holding company said it will use the money from the sale to repay a &quot;like amount of non-deposit liabilities.&quot; The combined moves are expected to &quot;improve core earnings&quot; and &quot;increase the ratio of capital to assets,&quot; SFFed said.    Following the sale, SFFed, the holding company for San Francisco Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association, said it will have assets of about $3.46 billion. </TEXT></DOC>
