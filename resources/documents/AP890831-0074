De Mita told reporters that he informed the Christian Democratnational council that he was concerned the party ``gives theimpression of being in a different frequency than mine.''   ``I have already resigned,'' he said at the end of a three-daymeeting of the party leadership.   He suggested his management position restricted his freedom toexpress his views and that he needed time to reflect about thefuture line of the party.   The resignation further eroded the power of one of the mostinfluential Italian politicians of the 1980s. It also underscoredthe discord that has recently grown among traditional and moreliberal factions of the party that has dominated Italian governmentsince World War II.   Political observers have speculated that a De Mita resignationcould lead to a formal split in the Christian Democrat party. Such adivision would radically change the political landscape in Italy,where the Christian Democrats have been the main force keeping theCommunists out of power.   De Mita, 61, resigned as premier in May after heading thegovernment for 13 months. His fall from power began three monthsearlier when he was forced to step down as Christian Democrat partysecretary, the party's top post, because of charges by party membersthat he held too much power.   He was named party president, a position with far less authority.   Months of bickering followed between De Mita and Socialist Partyleader Bettino Craxi. On May 19, De Mita resigned as head of afive-party coalition that also included the Socialists, SocialDemocrats, Liberals and Republicans.   Christian Democrat veteran Giulio Andreotti formed Italy's 49thpostwar government in late July, after two months of unsuccessfulefforts to resurrect the De Mita government.   De Mita's resignation appeared to give ground to Andreotti'sfaction in the Christian Democrats, which is considered conservativeand Roman Catholic Church-oriented. De Mita headed what wasconsidered the party's left wing.   De Mita remains a member of the Chamber of Deputies, or lowerhouse of Parliament. It wasn't immediately clear whether he wouldstay on as a member of the party national council.</TEXT></DOC>
