The Board requestssuggestions on what changes are needed to give Federal credit unions (``FCU's'')the flexibility needed to prosper under current market conditions. Forexample, NCUA is asking for comment on these matters: 1. Is the current working definition of ``participation loan'' in andSection;701.22(a)(1) satisfactory? 2. Should the term ``credit union organization'' in andSection; 701.22(a)(4)be redefined as ``an organization satisfying the requirements of andSection;701.27?'' 3. Are the regulatory restrictions on loan participation and purchase,sale and pledge of eligible obligations: (a) unclear, (b) too complex?If so, how should they be changed? 4. Do the current differences in regulation between participation loansand purchase, sale and pledge of loans continue to make sense in today'seconomic environment? 5. Does NCUA's current regulatory structure on participation loans andpurchase, sale, and pledge of eligible obligations: (a) Limit FCU abilityto make good loans to members; (b) create unnecessary liquidity problemsfor some FCU's; (c) force too much of an FCU's assets into lower yieldinginvestments? 6. What safety-and-soundness limits should be placed on an FCU's purchaseof or risk-sharing in loans made by other credit unions? 7. Should different standards apply to natural person FCU's and to corporateFCU's?</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">The Board will consider all other suggestions to improve its currentregulatory guidance in this area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Comments must be received on or before January 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS:</T2> Send comments to Becky Baker, Secretary, NCUA Board,National Credit Union Administration, 1776 G Stret NW., Washington, DC20456.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> Timothy P.

Section 107(5)(E)of the Act [12 U.S.C. 1757(5)(E)] states:<ITAG tagnum="21">[An FCU shall have power] * * * to participate with other credit unions,credit union organizations, or financial organizations in making loansto credit union members in accordance with the following: * * * (E) Participationloans with other credit unions, credit union organizations, or financialorganizations shall be in accordance with written policies of the boardof directors. <T3>Provided,</T3> That a credit union which originates a loan for whichparticipation arrangements are made in accordance with this subsectionshall retain an interest of at least 10 per centum of the face amount ofthe loan.</ITAG>Section 107(13) of the FCU Act [12 U.S.C. andSection; 1757(13)] authorizesan FCU:<ITAG tagnum="20">in accordance with rules and regulations prescribed by the [NCUA]Board, to purchase, sell, pledge, or discount or otherwise receive or disposeof, in whole or in part, any eligible obligations (as defined by the [NCUA]Board) of its members . . . . but no purchase may be made under authorityof this paragraph if, upon the making of that purchase, the aggregate ofthe unpaid balances of notes purchased under authority of this paragraphwould exceed 5 per centum of the unimpaired capital and surplus of thecredit union.</ITAG>Section 107(14) [12 U.S.C. andSection; 1757(14)] gives an FCU power:<ITAG tagnum="20">to sell all or a part of its assets to another credit union, to purchaseall or part of the assets of another credit union and to assume the liabilitiesof the selling credit union and those of its members subject to regulationsof the [NCUA] Board.</ITAG>This provision was adopted primarily ``to provide additional latitude toa credit union suffering a bona fide liquidity crisis.'' 43 FR 51610 (Novemer6, 1978). <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Interpretation of the Term ``Participation.'' </ITAG>When andSection; 701.22 was first issued [43 FR 51610 (Novemer 6, 1978)],the NCUA Board discussed the term ``participation'':<ITAG tagnum="21">The term ``participation'' is not a precise term in commercial lawand practice. It is used at different times to refer to arrangements madeprior to or at the time of orgination, to refer to arrangements made subsequentto origination, and to refer to arrangements made without regard to thetime of origination. In granting Federal credit unions the power to participatein making loans to members, Congress was using the term ``participation''to mean arrangements made prior to or at the time of orgination and carriedout within a reasonable time thereafter. Thus, 107(13) was adopted to allowFederal credit unions to sell certain loans subsequent to origination .. .</ITAG>In 1981, the Board modified its view slightly [46 FR 31660 (June 17, 1981)]:<ITAG tagnum="21">The participation regulation applies where a third party funnels fundsinto the credit union with the intent of actually participating in makingthe loan, for example, where the participant will assist in preparing theloan documentation and the participant's funds will actually be disbursedat origination. The participation regulation does not apply when an organizationmerely arranges to purchase loans subsequently originated by the creditunion.</ITAG>The Board invites comments which may lead: To a more comprehensive andup-to-date definition of the term; to regulation which reflects not simplywhen the agreement was entered into but the risks assigned and undertaken,and to a regulation of participation loans which fits better into NCUA'sgeneral guidance on asset acquisition and disposition. <ITAG tagnum="85">Regulatory Interpretation of the Term ``Credit Union Organization''</ITAG>Section 701.22(a)(4) defines ``credit union organization'' as:<ITAG tagnum="20">any organization as determined by the Board, established primarilyto serve the daily operational needs of its member credit unions. The termdoes not include trade associations, membership organizations principallycomposed of credit unions, or corporations or other businesses which principallyprovide services to credit union members as opposed to corporations orbusinesses whose business relates to the daily in-house operation of creditunions.</ITAG>The Board requests comments on whether the term ``credit union organization''should be redefined as ``an organization satisfying the requirements ofandSection; 701.27 of NCUA's Rules and Regulations [12 CFR 701.27] regardingFCU investment in and loans to credit union service organizations.'' Thisis in accord with NCUA's interpretation of the term ``credit union organization''contained in section 107(5)(D) of the FCU Act [12 U.S.C. 1757(5)(D)], whichauthorizes FCU loans to credit union organizations. Loans to credit unionorganizations pursuant to section 107(5)(D) of the FCU Act are subjectto andSection; 701.27 of NCUA's regulations. Such a change would also broadenFCU authority to engage in loan participations with credit union organizationsby removing the prohibition against loan participations with credit unionorganizations whose principal function is to provide services to FCU members(e.g. consumer mortgage loan origination) rather than to provide servicesdirectly to FCU's. <ITAG tagnum="81">Regulatory Procedures </ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility Act The NCUA Board has determined and certifies that the action being consideredwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall credit unions. The action being considered is directed at clarificationand reduction of regulatory confusion and interpretive burdens, ratherthan creation of new regulatory restrictions. Therefore, a regulatory flexibilityanalysis is not required. Paperwork Reduction Act The action being considered does not impose any paperwork requirements.Executive Order 12612 The action being considered does not affect state regulation of state-charteredcredit unions. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701 </ITAG>Loan participation; Participation; Eligible obligations; Purchase, saleand pledge of eligible obligations.<ITAG tagnum="21">By the National Credit Union Administration Board on October 13, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary, NCUA Board. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-24502 Filed 10-21-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 7535-01-M </ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
