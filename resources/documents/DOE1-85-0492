It provides rough estimates ofthe logistics and costs of transporting 3.7 million tons of salt fromthe repository to the salt disposal site near Carlsbad, New Mexico andreturning it to the repository for decommissioning backfill. The studyassumes that a railcar/truck system will be installed and that the excavatedsalt will be transported from the repository to an existing potash minelocated near Carlsbad, New Mexico approximately 300 miles from the repository.The 3.7 million tons of salt required for repository decommissioningbackfill can be stored in the potash mines along with the excess salt,with no additional capital costs required for either a railcar or a trucktransportation system. The capital cost for facilities to reclaim the3.7 million tons of salt from the potash mine is estimated to be $4,400,000with either a rail or truck transportation system. Segregating the 3.7million tons of backfill salt in a surface storage area at the potashmine requires a capital cost of $13,900,000 with a rail system or $11,400,000with a truck system. Transportation costs are estimated at $0.08/ton-milefor rail and $0.13/ton-mile for truck. 2 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
