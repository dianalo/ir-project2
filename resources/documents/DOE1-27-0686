The analysis assumes that corrosion results in a uniformly increasedinterior channel of the cooler. The as-built cooler section and threesections with increasingly larger channels are analyzed by the ADINAfinite element code. Stresses for each cooler section at an operatingpressure of 120 psi and an overpressure of 300 psi are presented. Additionally,the as-built cooler section is analyzed to an extreme overpressure of1500 psi. The analysis indicates that the peripheral cooler can maintainstructural integrity at severely reduced web thicknesses and significantoverpressures. Part 2 of this report contains plots of the cooler sectionsat pressure and steady-state operating temperatures. 112 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
