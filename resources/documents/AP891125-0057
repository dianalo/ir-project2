ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>QUANTICO, Va. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The real crime capital of the world may bea small town nestled in a rural Virginia forest where bankrobberies, kidnappings and deadly extortion plots are runningrampant. The town's mayor, however, shrugs it off with a serenesmile.   After all, as the interminable struggle between good and evilrages outside his office window, Jim Pledger boasts a police forcethat would be the envy of any big-city mayor _ dozens of smart,square-jawed young FBI trainees.   Pledger is mayor of ``Hogan's Alley,'' a fictitious butstrikingly realistic town built on a wooded, 20-acre site at theFBI Academy, about 40 miles south of Washington, D.C., wherestudents practice nabbing criminals, interrogating witnesses andgathering evidence.   ``This is the most crime-ridden town in the world,'' saysPledger, the training unit chief in charge of Hogan's Alley. ``Butthe great thing is that our law enforcement people have a 100percent success rate solving crimes.''   At first glance, the town is picture-book America, with its ownpost office, drugstore, bank, barber shop, combination pool halland Greyhound bus station, coin-operated laundry, movie theater,motel and boarding houses.   All are phony except for the Pastime Bar, where FBI employeescan step inside for a cup of coffee or a sandwich while waiting forthe next crime wave.   Visitors with long memories might notice something familiarabout the movie theater, the Biograph, which features Clark Gableand Myrna Loy in ``Manhattan Melodrama.'' It was under the samemarquee of the Biograph Theater in Chicago that gangster JohnDillinger was shot dead in 1934.   In this town, there are no mothers pushing baby carriages ormerchants hurrying to work. The streets are strangely empty untilthe silence is broken by volleys from blank-firing shotguns andrevolvers, the squealing tires of police cruisers and shouts of``Freeze! This is the FBI!''   The make-believe bad guys and witnesses who inhabit Hogan'sAlley are amateur ``role players'' hired by the hour through acommercial talent agency.   They include housewives from the neighboring Marine Corps baseat Quantico, schoolteachers, retirees and off-duty firefighters andpolice officers. None has any previous acting experience.   ``In this town, crime pays _ at $8 an hour,'' says Pledger.   A huge sign on the outskirts of town gives visitors fair warning:   ``Welcome to Hogan's Alley. City Limits. Caution: Lawenforcement training exercises in progress. Display of weapons,firing of blank ammunition and arrests may occur. If challenged,please follow instructions. Have a nice day.''   Last Wednesday, the day started literally with a bang at 8:20a.m. when the Hogan Bank was robbed. Three gunmen fled with about$30,000 in play money, some of it in $50 bills bearing Pledger'sportrait.   Four teams of FBI trainees _ 44 in all _ sprang into action,following a minute-by-minute script written by their supervisors.   While the first team was interviewing bank employees and dustingthe teller's cage for fingerprints, other trainees quickly arrestedthe first suspect, a shaggy-haired man in plaid shirt and jeans, athis hideout in the Dogwood Inn motel.   Another gunman was grabbed, handcuffed and frisked outside histhree-story townhouse while his girlfriend loudly complained and anosy neighbor gawked. The third suspect, who lives in the localtrailer park, was caught in an FBI ambush at Will Johnson's Garage,where he had left his aging green sedan for repairs.   Case closed in just four hours.   ``These trainees know they're play-acting, but their adrenalinereally gets pumping,'' said training supervisor Donald J. Gray.   The nosy neighbor outside the townhouse was Thomas Burkhard, aretired Massachusetts dairy marketing executive who now lives innearby Woodbridge, Va. His daughter, Lisa Bennett, a doctor'sreceptionist and mother of two, played the bank teller in the phonyrobbery.   ``It's fun, frankly,'' said Burkhard. ``I don't do it for themoney, I do it because I enjoy it. It's ideal for me _ gives mesomething to do three or four days a month.''   Has he discovered any hidden talents for acting?   Burkhard laughed and replied, ``My role is to be a nuisance, andI've almost been kicked off the porch a couple of times. I get athumbs-up occasionally from the instructors.''</TEXT></DOC>
