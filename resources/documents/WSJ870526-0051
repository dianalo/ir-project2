But traders doubt that last week's jawboning by top Japanese officials will have a lasting effect.    &quot;If the market heats up again, banks will be obliged to protect their shareholders, which means sell the dollar,&quot; Bruce Pflaum, vice president, foreign exchange, at First National Bank of Chicago's Tokyo branch, said.    Japan wants to avoid a further dollar decline because it would make Japanese exporters' products more expensive for Americans. It also would create foreign exchange losses for Japanese investors in dollar-denominated assets, such as U.S. stocks and bonds. Over the past two years, the dollar has lost about 47% of its value against the yen.    This spring, the Bank of Japan led several major central banks in a massive intervention effort aimed at controlling a runaway dollar decline. The central banks bought an estimated $30 billion of the U.S. currency in foreign exchange markets.    The intervention is partly credited for the dollar's stability this month; but so is the coaxing by the Tokyo government. A few weeks ago, Japan's Ministry of Finance began asking Japanese banks, exporters and securities and insurance concerns to halt speculative dollar sales for the good of Japan.    This &quot;moral suasion,&quot; as it was called then, turned to arm-twisting last week as the ministry asked financial concerns -- including foreign-based financial companies operating in Tokyo -- to disclose their currency positions at four points during the day.    Several U.S.-based concerns, while expressing annoyance, said they probably will comply with the disclosure request.    &quot;It's on a so-called voluntary basis, like in the Army,&quot; one U.S. executive in Tokyo said.    The head of world-wide foreign exchange at a major U.S. bank operating in Japan called the Finance Ministry's request &quot;a form of harassment that goes against the grain of free-market movements.&quot;    &quot;It's something we, the foreign banks, wouldn't normally be inclined to comply with,&quot; he said. &quot;But all of us are interested in developing further business in Japan, and none of us wants to create an unfriendly relationship with the Ministry of Finance.&quot;    With the dollar staying between 139 and 141 yen through most of May, the Japanese government's tactics appear to be working, with some help from the effects of last month's intervention.    &quot;(Government) guidance tends to be adhered to more (in Japan) than in the States,&quot; a Tokyo-based trader for a U.S. bank said.    First Chicago's Mr. Pflaum said the Ministry of Finance's cajoling of potential dollar sellers was affecting the market. &quot;It has definitely quieted down,&quot; he said.    But traders also say the market was due for a rest anyway and that governments might prove helpless to stop another dollar downturn once selling momentum builds up.    Christine W. Patton, senior managing director and head of global foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said Japan may be missing the real target by taking aim at the banks.    &quot;The banks reflect the market pressures. They don't necessarily make them,&quot; she said.    ---   Monday Currency Activity   The dollar rose in light trading in Tokyo yesterday as traders noted some relaxation in bearishness toward the U.S. currency.    There also was technically based buying in the belief the dollar has bottomed out for a while and an upward correction is imminent, the traders said.    In general, though, holidays in the U.S. and Britain made participants in markets elsewhere reluctant to open substantial positions in the absence of New York and London players, dealers said.    In late Tokyo trading, the dollar rose to 140.93 yen from 140.83 in New York late Friday. Against the West German currency, the dollar rose to 1.7836 marks in Frankfurt from 1.7818 in New York late Friday.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 141.70 yen.    There has been a &quot;gradual change in sentiment&quot; about the dollar in the Tokyo traders, a dealer said, because of bullish comments by Treasury Secretary James Baker and Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter, who implied a desire to see stable dollar-yen exchange rates.    However, the dollar's rise will be slow because Japanese exporters and other commercial holders are expected to sell large amounts of the currency once it is well above 141 yen, the dealer said.    In Frankfurt, the dollar stayed in a narrow range around 1.783 marks, traders said, and met technical resistance at 1.785 marks.    The dollar may be moved Friday by the release of U.S. leading economic indicators, traders said, but they don't expect any major swings in the near future.    Also, in advance of the June 8 Venice summit among the seven major industrialized democracies, the market is taking a wait-and-see attitude, traders said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York Friday, gold for current delivery fell $5.50 an ounce to $464 in brisk trading estimated at 6.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $463.75 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                   Monday, May 25, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
