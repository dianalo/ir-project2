Electron spectrograms were takenby means of an electron spectrometer and a position sensitive electroncounter. We have observed definitely an electron line located at 328.6+- 0.4 keV in the spectrograms from the Th and U targets, but not foundin the Ta target. The kinetic energy and the intrinsic FWHM of the linewere deduced to be 330.8 +- 1.0 keV and 3.7 +- 0.5 keV, respectively.The cross section was estimated to be 28 +- 10 mb/sr and 34 +- 13 mb/srfor Th and U, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
