Intraoperative irradiation resolves this problemby shielding critical organs. In the treatment of pediatric malignancieslocated in abdomen, however, the spinal cord often exists within theirradiation field. The patients are usually given chemotherapeutic agentsalong with radiation. I here investigated the radiation damage on spinalcord of infantile mice under combination with adriamycin (ADR), or vincristine(VCR). Four week-old C3Hf/He mice, were used throughout experiments.Lumber cord of spine (L1-L5) was irradiated with a single fraction ofX-ray. Irradiation was performed with a 250 kvp X-ray machine. EitherADR (5 {mu}g/g) or VCR (0.2 {mu}g/g) was injected intraperitoneally either7 days before, 30 min. before, or 7 days after irradiation. Changes ofneurological status were scored by the status of paralysis in mice. Thelatent period between radiation and onset of paralysis was not affected,but the latency of abnormal reflex of hind-leg was shortened by combiningthe drugs with radiation. Only irradiated mice needed 200 days to showthe damage at 30 Gy, and mice administered with chemotherapeutic agentsshowed the same damage earlier i.e. 40 {similar_to} 120 days differingby timing of combination. In clinic, patients irradiated intraoperativelyat a dose of 15 Gy did not show any enhanced radiation damage by assessingof evoked response and motor nerve conduction velocity compared withthose irradiated by fractionation.</TEXT></DOC>
