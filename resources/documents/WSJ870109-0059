StevensStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 01/09/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP JAPAN FREST CANDAMONETARY NEWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, TRADE (MON)FOREIGN-EXCHANGE MARKETS (FRX)COMMODITY NEWS, FARM PRODUCTS (CMD)PRECIOUS METALS, STONES, GOLD, SILVER (PCS) </IN><TEXT>   The U.S. dollar fell sharply against major European currencies yesterday, exacerbating strains within the European Monetary System.    In Europe, several central banks continued to play an active role in foreign-exchange markets, supporting their respective currencies against the West German mark. In some cases, the mark traded at its highest permissible level in the EMS, the joint float of eight European currencies.    The Bank of Japan also was reported to have intervened yesterday to support the dollar against the yen. In addition to selling yen for dollars in Asia, traders said the Japanese central bank intervened in the New York market via the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.    Traders said selling of marks for French francs by the West German and French central banks yesterday was slightly below Wednesday's levels, when each of the central banks was estimated to have purchased as much as four billion francs.    Besides the French franc, the Belgian and Danish currencies also remained near their EMS floors against the mark. The Italian lira fell to a record low against the mark, but stayed above its floor against the West German currency.    The Bank of Italy sold marks at the Milan foreign-exchange fixing and also was said to be active in the open market. The central bank also bought $30 million at the fixing. The Belgian central bank reportedly sold marks against its currency, though on a relatively small scale since the Belgian franc strengthened slightly after that country's half-point discount rate increase, which took effect today.    Some foreign-exchange traders believe the strains within the EMS are almost entirely linked to the dollar's decline. As speculators sell the U.S. unit in interbank markets, they tend to buy marks, which strengthens the West German unit in relation to other European currencies. &quot;This problem in Europe is really a dollar problem,&quot; said Garrett R. Glass, vice president of foreign-exchange at First National Bank of Chicago. &quot;The weak dollar is causing the problems for the EMS,&quot; he said.    Traders remain overwhelmingly negative in their outlooks for the dollar, but concern about central bank intervention supporting the U.S. unit has tempered selling. In addition to the Bank of Japan yesterday, earlier this week the West German and other European central banks sold marks to buy dollars in their effort to weaken the mark.    &quot;Everybody wants to sell (dollars) but nobody wants to get caught in the whiplash that happens when the (West German) Bundesbank does their thing,&quot; said Mary Ann T. Tompkins, senior trader at Royal Bank of Canada, New York. &quot;Everybody is very, very wary of central bank intervention,&quot; she said.    In late New York trading yesterday, the dollar stood at 1.9145 marks, down from 1.9281 Wednesday. The dollar also dropped to 1.6039 Swiss francs from 1.6208.    Against the Japanese unit, the dollar fell to 157.62 yen, from 158.03. Many traders said the Bank of Japan's intervention appeared to be aimed at defending the 158-yen level against the dollar. Japan regularly has sought to slow the dollar's descent because of its negative impact on that country's export revenue. A weaker dollar makes Japanese goods more expensive to American consumers.    In early trading in Tokyo Friday the dollar fell against the Japanese currency to 157.50 yen from 157.62 in New York yesterday afternoon.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York yesterday, gold for current delivery fell 30 cents an ounce to $402.30 in moderate trading estimated at 3.2 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $402.55 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---                        CURRENCY RATES                          New York    Home Mkt.
