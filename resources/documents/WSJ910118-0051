Officials of the West's energy group, which comprises 21industrial nations, confirmed this possibility after thesurprisingly swift drop of some $10 a barrel in oil prices.</LP><TEXT>   The price plunge came after early successes by U.S. airraids suggested that Saddam Hussein lacks the punch todestroy Saudi Arabia's oil facilities. Traders and some oilcompanies blamed yesterday's IEA announcement that it wasactivating its week-old contingency plan as a majorcontributor to the oil-price crash.   A move to downsize or rescind the IEA offering, though,could meet resistance from the U.S., the largest contributorof oil under the plan. Assistant Energy Secretary JohnEaston, a U.S. delegate to the IEA, said the price of oilshouldn't be a factor in determining how much oil to release.He added that he hasn't heard of any discussion to change thetwo million barrels a day offering world-wide and that theU.S. will take bids through Jan. 25 to sell 1.125 millionbarrels a day from its reserves.   Elsewhere, IEA officials yesterday took note of thebacklash from oil traders and suggested they might havesecond thoughts about going through with the contingencyplan. One official said the IEA, which had hoped to calm oilmarkets in the event of war, was drawing criticism for&quot;destabilizing&quot; petroleum prices.   Under its contingency plan, the IEA governing board isscheduled to meet Jan. 28 to reassess the oil-supplysituation, including emergency preparedness, before a finaldecision to activate the plan. The plan provides that thedraw-down of oil reserves would take effect a few days later.   George Quincy Lumsden, the IEA's director of oil markets,termed this the &quot;fail-safe&quot; part of the contingency plan. Healso cited a crucial clause in the plan that calls for thegoverning board at its late January meeting &quot;to assess theenergy implications and to decide upon any modificationswhich may be required in the contingency plan.&quot;   Mr. Lumsden declined to predict whether the governingboard would decide to change the contingency plan or drop itentirely. &quot;I wouldn't want to prejudge the situation,&quot; hesaid, &quot;but, as of now, not a single drop of IEA strategic oilhas been offered for sale.&quot;   Mr. Easton of the U.S. Energy Department said the agencyhas the authority to revise the amount of oil it sells, evenafter bids are received. But he said: &quot;There is no thinking .. . that one day's worth of market activities should changeour thinking in any way whatsoever. This is not a one-dayevent.&quot;   He said the potential for a shortfall of oil, rather thanprice, is supposed to determine how much oil is offeredthrough the IEA plan. &quot;If we consider there is still apotential that warrants the plan, I don't think you'll seeany modification in the plan,&quot; he said.   Various other countries have announced their shares ofparticipation in the contingency plan -- if it comes off --including Germany, 187,000 barrels a day; Japan, 350,000;Britain, 120,000; Italy, 130,000; and Canada, 115,000.   Unless the war in the Persian Gulf is over by the time theIEA meets, reducing the draw-down from the U.S. StrategicPetroleum Reserve would be politically unpopular at home.Various congressmen, oil companies, analysts and consumergroups -- many of whom were severely critical of PresidentBush for not tapping the reserve when the price of oilescalated to more than $40 a barrel last fall -- welcomed theIEA's announcement to make 2.5 million barrels a dayavailable: two million from stockpiles and 500,000 fromdemand restraints.   At a news conference, Energy Secretary James Watkinscredited the IEA's announcement and military successes in theGulf with calming the volatile oil markets. He said plans fora large early draw-down of world stockpiles have a &quot;positiveimpact.&quot; Moreover, he indicated that depending on how the wargoes, the IEA at the January meeting might &quot;need to beprepared&quot; for another draw-down.   In addition to tapping the oil reserve, the Bushadministration announced it will allow a one-time suspensionof the Jones Act, which otherwise would permit only U.S.-flagvessels to transport the oil. Because there is a limitednumber of U.S. vessels, the law poses a bottleneck that, forexample, restricted movement of scarce heating fuel supplieslast winter.   Despite a glut of oil on the market, several U.S. oilcompanies such as Shell Oil Co. said they are interested inbidding for the 33.75 million barrels that will be releasedfrom the almost 590-million-barrel U.S. stockpile. Two-thirdsof the offering will be sour crude, which is higher in sulfurand less desirable for some refineries. Officials, however,said the sour crude is a lighter grade than one millionbarrels of heavy sour crude that no one wanted to buy in anexperimental sale from the stockpile last year.   The first crude could be on the market by Feb. 2, but mostof it probably will be delivered in late February andthroughout March because of normal industry shippingschedules, officials said.</TEXT></DOC>
