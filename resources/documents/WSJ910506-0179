The Canadian action was required by provisions of theU.S.-Canada free trade agreement, which is graduallydismantling trade obstacles between the two countries.</LP><TEXT>   Nelson Denlinger, executive vice president of U.S. WheatAssociates, a U.S. wheat growers group, welcomed the Canadianmove &quot;in principle.&quot; But he said, &quot;I frankly think that itwon't result in any vast exports to Canada because it isn'tthat big a market.&quot; Canada produces far more wheat than itconsumes, exporting about two-thirds of its output, includinga substantial amount to the U.S.   The free trade agreement requires Canada to lift itsimport license rules for a U.S. grain, such as wheat, oatsand barley, when the U.S. subsidy of a particular grain dropsto at least the Canadian subsidy level.   The latest subsidy calculations put Canadian governmentwheat support at 31.12% of the value of Canadian wheatproduction, compared with a 26.8% support level in the U.S.   U.S. barley, according to the latest calculations,continued to be more heavily subsidized than Canadian barley,keeping it subject to a Canadian import license. Suchlicenses are seldom issued. The license requirement for oatswas lifted in 1989 when the U.S. subsidy level fell below theCanadian level.   Canadian government officials had been indicating thatthey mightn't accept the latest subsidy calculations becauseof what they said were exceptional crop factors that hadcaused the Canadian wheat subsidy level to rise. But TradeMinister Michael Wilson said Friday that Canada and the U.S.had agreed on the calculations.   The U.S. doesn't impose any curbs on grain imports fromCanada. Canadian wheat exports to the U.S. in the first sevenmonths of Canada's current crop year totaled a record 434,000metric tons (15.9 million bushels). Canada's crop year endsJuly 31. About 47% of Canadian wheat exports to the U.S. thisyear have been durum wheat, which is used to make pastaproducts.   Canada intends to keep close watch on U.S. wheat shipmentsinto the Canadian market to make sure it doesn't affectCanada's grading system for grain. U.S. wheat shipped to aCanadian miller will require an end-use certificate from agovernment agency, the Canadian Grain Commission, stipulatingthat the grain must be used at the facility to which it isbeing sent.   U.S. wheat for livestock feed won't require an end-usecertificate. But a coloring agent will be added to it toensure that it doesn't affect Canadian wheat grades and getre-exported as Canadian wheat, a government official said.   Mr. Denlinger of U.S. Wheat Associates, said hisorganization will be monitoring Canadian procedures &quot;verycarefully to see they in fact treat&quot; U.S. wheat fairly.Potential U.S. wheat exporters to Canada will face aformidable competitor in the Canadian Wheat Board, agovernment agency that markets western Canadian wheat andbarley. &quot;The U.S. government for some time has felt that themonopoly pricing and export authority of the Canadian WheatBoard gives it an unfair advantage in the highly competitiveworld wheat market,&quot; said Carol Goodloe, a U.S. AgricultureDepartment analyst.   Canada, in anticipation of a possible opening of itsdomestic wheat market, eliminated in 1988 a two-price wheatsystem that had kept domestic prices substantially higherthan international prices.   Prairie Pools Inc., which represents western Canada's bigfarm cooperatives, urged the Canadian government to keepbarriers against U.S. wheat until the U.S. stops using itsExport Enhancement Program to subsidize U.S. wheat exports&quot;in markets that have traditionally been held by Canada.&quot; ACanadian government official said the import licenserequirement for U.S. wheat will probably be removed laterthis week.</TEXT></DOC>
