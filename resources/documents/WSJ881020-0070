No patients were injured in the tests, which were conducted at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary three years ago for a drug for dry-eye conditions. The drug, called Tretinoin, is a vitamin A-containing ointment that is being developed by Spectra Pharmaceutical Services Inc., Hanover, Mass.    The researcher, Scheffer C.G. Tseng, now an assistant professor at the University of Miami School of Medicine, couldn't be reached for comment. He formerly worked as a consultant for Spectra, which was formed in 1985 and purchased rights to Tretinoin from Dr. Tseng.    The tests in question were preliminary studies of Tretinoin's effect on mild or moderate dry-eye conditions. An estimated 10 million Americans are afflicted with dry eyes, which are caused by different diseases.    In mid-1985, Dr. Tseng reported that in a study with 22 patients, Tretinoin showed promise in treating the condition, Spectra said. He then continued testing the drug with more than 200 patients who weren't authorized to receive it, according to an article in yesterday's Boston Globe. Moreover, Dr. Tseng and his family profited from ownership of Spectra stock while he conducted the studies of Tretinoin, according to the Globe article.    After Dr. Tseng left Harvard in 1986, the school investigated his clinical work. In a statement yesterday, the medical school said its investigation showed violations of its policies, including incomplete disclosures of an expansion of the Tretinoin study.    In March 1987, Spectra disclosed that Tretinoin's early promise in treating moderate dry-eye conditions wasn't confirmed by later tests. Its stock price, which Tretinoin's promise had helped to boost to about $8 a share in early 1986, fell to less than $1 a share in late 1987.    Spectra has continued testing the drug for relatively rare, severe dry-eye conditions. Last week, a published report in a medical journal based on tests conducted independently of Dr. Tseng's studies indicated Tretinoin helps patients with the severe form of the disorder.    &quot;I have unshakeable faith it will help those patients&quot; with severe dry-eye conditions, said James A. Hannan, Spectra's president. &quot;But with the milder form, it's basically no help.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
