(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The sex scandals surrounding twoprominent Assemblies of God ministers should not taint the morethan 30,000 others in the church, of whom only a tiny number areever disciplined, an official says.   The evangelical church, which counts more than 16 millionadherents worldwide and operates four colleges, is investigatingthe misconduct of its most popular television preacher, Louisianaevangelist Jimmy Swaggart.   On Monday, a day after Swaggart temporarily stepped down fromhis pulpit, church officials said he had admitted to a long historyof sexual misconduct and would be prohibited from preaching for aminimum of three months while he undergoes rehabilitation.   Another prominent television evangelist, the PTL's Jim Bakker,lost his Assemblies of God credentials last year amid charges ofsexual misconduct. Swaggart was said to have been active inuncovering that scandal and Bakker accused him of plotting to takeover PTL.   ``Those are the only two in our whole denomination that havethat kind of recognition,'' church spokeswoman Juleen Turnage saidMonday. ``So people may feel that this is indicative of theAssemblies of God denomination, and that is not true.   ``We have over 30,000 credentialed ministers in the Assembliesof God in the United States. At any given time, any given year,fewer than one-half of 1 percent are ever called into discipline.''   Mrs. Turnage said 12 areas of misconduct, ranging from doctrinalaberrations to moral failure, call for disciplinary action.   Swaggart's suspension and two-year rehabilitation program mustbe approved by the church's Executive Presbytery in Springfield,according to the church's by-laws, she said.   Swaggart appeared before his congregation in Baton Rouge, La.,on Sunday to ask forgiveness from his family and church for an acthe did not describe publicly. He said he would not return to hispulpit until the church investigation was completed.</TEXT></DOC>
