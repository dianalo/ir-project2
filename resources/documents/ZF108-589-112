Staiano, president and general manager of Motorola's GeneralSystems Sector.andM;SPEEDS, FEEDS andamp; PRICINGandM;The MultiPersonal Computer comes in three models: the MPC-100, MPC-200 andthe dual-processor MPC-300.andM;Each system comes standard with MCG's new Motorola Network Display Stations.andO;The Motorola Network Display Stations, which are available in 16-inch and19-inch monochrome or 17-inch color models, are high-resolution, X-compliantdisplay stations with built-in networking and processing capabilities.andM;(a) MIPS rating based on use of DiaB 1.34 Release C compiler.andM;The MultiPersonal Computer will support, at time of delivery, more than 100commercial RISC-based applications tuned specifically for Motorola's M88000RISC architecture and compatible with Motorola's UNIX System V/88 operatingsystem.andM;More than 3,000 PICK and 2,500 BASIC FOUR-compatible vertical applicationsalso run on the MultiPersonal Computer.andM;In support of additional commercial applications, Motorola has an active ISVprogram consisting of national porting centers, conversion aids andISV-configured loaner equipment.andM;The Motorola Computer Group will market the MultiPersonal Computer directlyto large customers and indirectly through the value-added resellers andoriginal equipment manufacturers.andM;The Motorola Computer Group is part of the General Systems sector of MotorolaInc.andP;  It is comprised of four divisions:andM;-- the Computer Systems Division, based in Cupertino, Calif., marketsmidrange, multiuser computer systems and software solutions for commercialand government end users, and value-added resellers;andM;- the Field Service Division, based in Dallas, provides service, support andsystems integration capabilities for Motorola systems and component usersnationwide;andM;- the International Computer Division, based in Schaumburg, IL, markets,supports and services all Microcomputer Division and CSD products that aresold outside the United States;andM;- and the Microcomputer Division, based in Tempe, AZ.andM;Key Executives:andM;Edward F.
