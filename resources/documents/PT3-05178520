Above      a flat side of the casing is attachable to the device serviced by the      double pump and receives an insert defining the inlet and outlet apertures      and within the housing, defining two pump units each in conjunction with      the respective rotor. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  My present invention relates to a double centrifugal pump having two pump      rotors mounted in a casing and two electric motors disposed in parallel,      one beside the other. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Double pumps are known which are used for parallel, serial and separate      operation, with the possibility of changing the delivery direction and      also with a switch-over function. An independent construction must be      provided for each of these applications. </PAR><PAR>  Moreover, German OS 3624917 discloses how to dispose in the casing of a      centrifugal pump an insert which forms the inlet and the outlet and also      the spirally widening outlet channel. </PAR><PAC>  OBJECT OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  It is an object of the invention to provide a double centrifugal pump which      has a very simple and small construction and can be used for the various      applications with only slight alterations, while retaining the pump      casing. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  This object is achieved, according to the invention, by a pump which has      the following combination of features: </PAR><PAR>  the pump casing has a flat side wall containing an inlet and an outlet, </PAR><PAR>  the pump casing is attached via this flat side wall to a second device,      more particularly, a consuming device, </PAR><PAR>  disposed releasably in the pump casing is an insert which can be inserted      through a large aperture in the flat side wall and forms an inlet and an      outlet and also internal connecting channels, and </PAR><PAR>  disposed in the insert are one or more cut-off members, more particularly,      flap valves or non-return valves. </PAR><PAR>  In such a pump only the insert must be adapted to the various applications,      since the insert contains in the necessary manner of construction and      connection both the connecting channels and also the particular cut-off      member required, for example, a flap valve or the non-return valve. The      insert can readily be reached and interchanged via the aperture in the      flat side wall, while the dimensions of the connecting flange of the pump      casing remain the same. </PAR><PAR>  Particularly advantageously the insert forms a spirally widening outlet      channel for each rotor. The insert should also form at least a portion of      the flat side wall. Particularly advantageously the insert forms the      connection surfaces for the inlet and outlet. The insert can be produced      particularly cheaply if it is made of plastic. It is a major advantage if      the aperture in the flat side wall for the insert is circular and merges      into a cylindrical inner space of the pump casing. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING </PAC><PAR>  A more detailed description will now be given of an embodiment of the      invention with reference to the drawing, wherein: </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a side elevation of the flat side wall of the pump; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 is an axial section through the pump, the motor not being shown in      section; and </PAR><PAR>  FIGS. 3A-3F show various applications of the pump according to the      invention. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  SPECIFIC DESCRIPTION </PAC><PAR>  A double pump has two canned pumps and can be used as a hot water pump,      more particularly in heating installations. The pump 1 has a plastic or      metal pump casing 2 in which two rotors 9a are disposed axis-parallel and      in which a tubular inlet is formed axially. A spirally widening outlet      channel is disposed around each of the rotors. The casing 2 is circular      disc-shaped, the height H of the cylindrical outer wall being      substantially smaller than the diameter D of the flat circular pump side      wall 6. </PAR><PAR>  Inlets 7 and 8 form inlet apertures and outlet 4 with an outlet aperture      open at the side wall 6. The apertures are located in the plane of the      side wall 6. Two canned electric motors 9 are attached coaxially with the      rotors 9a to the side of the pump casing 2 opposite the side wall 6. </PAR><PAR>  The pump casing 2 has an inner insert 3 which tightly encloses the rotors      and forms the spirally widening outlet channels around the rotors, and an      outer casing 11 which encloses the insert 3 and which is attached to the      electric motors 9 and bears seals 13 lying in the plane of the side wall      6. The insert 3 therefore cooperates with the casing edge to form the flat      interface with the consumption or connection devices. Particularly      advantageously the aperture 5 in the flat side wall 6 for the insert 3 is      circular and merges into a cylindrical inner space 2a of the pump casing. </PAR><PAR>  The outer casing 11, acting as a pressure tank, forms parallel with the      side wall 6 flanges 12 formed with bores 14 which can receive screws. Via      these screws (not shown) the outer casing 11 and therefore the entire pump      can be attached to consumption devices. Rotors and inserts 3 of different      performances and constructions can be inserted into the outer casing 11. </PAR><PAR>  For this purpose not only can the rotors be replaced by differently shaped      rotors, but spiral channels enclosing the rotors and also the inlet can be      adapted to both the particular rotors and the required performance and      also to the particular range of speed. Furthermore, the inlets 7, 8 and      outlet 4, in the insert 3 can be adapted in their spacing and also in      their arrangement in the flat side wall 6 to the circumstances of the      consumption or connection devices. It is enough to interchange the insert      3 to meet the requirements made. </PAR><PAR>  The channels in the insert 3 can be differently shaped and arranged.      Cut-off members 4, for example, flap valves or non-return valves can be so      attached or mounted as to suit the particular purpose of use. </PAR><PAR>  The inner insert 3 can be constructed smaller than shown in the drawings.      It may be enough for the insert to form merely the inlet aperture 7 and      the control apparatus for the rotor. The insert 3 can also be made up of a      number of parts, being particularly simple to produce if it is made of      plastic. This makes it possible and economic to supply differently formed      inserts with the pump, so that the user can alter the function or output      of the pump prior to the incorporation of the insert. The pump units can      be connected in the modes shown in FIGS. 3A-3F. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
