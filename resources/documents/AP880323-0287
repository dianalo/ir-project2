Through the long winter that followed, the NASD and itspresident, Joseph Hardiman, have labored to repair the market'simage and recover the momentum it had been building since the early1970s.   By all accounts, that effort has produced some notable successesto date.   ``I feel that the NASD has done a real good job,'' said BinkleyShorts, portfolio manager of the Over-The-Counter Securities Fund,a mutual fund that concentrates in the market for unlisted stocksthat are traded through a network of dealers overseen by the NASD.   ``It feels pretty comfortable right now'' investing in OTCstocks, Shorts added.   But few observers argue that the mission of restoring investors'confidence in the over-the-counter market, or in stocks in general,is anywhere near complete.   ``We've taken some first steps, some important steps,'' Hardimansaid in an interview at his office here. ``There's more to bedone.''   The crash hit at a time when the NASD, after a decade ofdramatic expansion and innovation, was bidding to challenge the NewYork Stock Exchange for preeminence in the U.S. stock market.   It claimed that its multiple-dealer system was superior to thatof the Big Board and other exchanges, where a single broker knownas a specialist operating on the trade floor acts as a meetingpoint for buy and sell orders in a given stock.   But in the worst days of the crunch, some beleagueredover-the-counter dealers backed away from the NASD's automatedsmall-order execution system, known as SOES.   Investors and brokers ran into busy signal after busy signal asthey tried to reach dealers who were either unable or unwilling tohandle the volume of telephone calls and orders.   ``The market was put to a severe test, and it suffered ahangover that lasted for at least a couple of weeks,'' recalledShorts.   Within a month, the NASD came up with plans to strengthen SOESand increase the responsibilities of dealers. Those measures havebeen approved and are scheduled to be put into effect by late Mayor early June, Hardiman said.   For one thing, participation in SOES, formerly optional fordealers, will now be mandatory. For another, any dealer who pullsout of the market for a stock without a special exemption will bebarred from returning for 30 days.   ``If we have a recurrence of the kind of thing that happenedlast fall, market-makers must stay in,'' observed Ralph Costanza,head of the over-the-counter trading department at the brokeragefirm of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   Meanwhile, as stocks in general have staged a rally since lastDecember, over-the-counter issues have enjoyed a particularlyvigorous rebound.   From Jan. 1 through mid-March, the NASDAQ (the AQ stands forautomated quotations) composite index of OTC stocks rose 15.47percent, outpacing a 10.43 percent rise in the NYSE's compositeindex of all its listed common stocks.   In the midst of the crash, said Shorts, ``there was anopportunity for us to buy at ridiculously low prices.''   Looking back, Hardiman says, ``we took a lot of criticism earlybecause the problem was access to our markets. But all markets hadtheir problems.''   Looking ahead, he says further efforts will be made tostrengthen the system. A committee chaired by Irving Pollack, aformer member of the Securities and Exchange Commission, is due toreport in May on a study of the structure and quality of the OTCmarket, and Hardiman expects it to make some significantrecommendations.   The changes that are already being made, he says, have preparedthe NASDAQ system to function better if and when another financialstorm strikes: ``I think we can handle an event like that _ I don'tsay without difficulty _ but with far fewer problems.''   He acknowledges that the crash was a setback to the NASD'sambitions for its market, but adds that it may well prove to havebeneficial side effects.   ``We have experienced sensational growth, particularly over thelast 10 years,'' he said. ``October, not by choice, gave us anopportunity to pause and reflect.   ``We're going through a period of digestion _ some pundits maysay indigestion,'' he added. ``It's great to grow, but we also wantto have a quality marketplace.''   After the current process of reevaluation and remodeling,Hardiman said, ``I believe we're going to be poised for anothersignificant period of growth.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday March 27</NOTE></DOC>
