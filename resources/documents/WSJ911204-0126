In this city, which is 70% black and has one of thehighest murder rates in the nation (and in which thepossession of a handgun, registered or not, is illegal), mostcrimes involving handguns are perpetrated by black men, manyof them still in their teens.</LP><TEXT>   Often overlooked, however, is the fact that theoverwhelming majority of the victims of these crimes are alsoblack, many of them women and children. Just the otherevening, virtually in sight of the Capitol, where Congresswas in session, a young black woman was killed by a handgunfired at close range while she was riding in a car driven byher husband on a busy highway. The alleged murderer, now incustody, is a black, 19-year-old male. Similarly tragic ifless heinous events create new victims in this and othercities every day, many of them people of color. In fact, eachyear many thousands of lives are prematurely terminated, andothers forever blighted, by the use of handguns.   Mr. Innis has a long and distinguished history of workingfor the betterment of black people. Whatever the merits ofhis historical view of gun control, however, let me assurehim that today, those of us in this country who areincreasingly outraged by the carnage all around us don't givea damn who is holding the gun. We simply wonder how thatinstrument of death came to be in that hand, why we are nowall at risk in our very own neighborhoods, and at theinability of our elected representatives -- both state andfederal -- to face up to the obvious solutions.   Arthur R. Watson   Washington   ---   Mr. Innis's assertion that gun-control initiatives in thelate 19th and early 20th centuries were partly raciallymotivated should not divert attention from the fact that,proportionately, blacks suffer the highest number offirearm-related violent crimes in America.   The Congress of Racial Equality should be in the forefrontof efforts to limit availability of assault rifles and otherautomatic weapons; to require waiting periods for thepurchase of firearms, and to apply higher penalties to crimescommitted by armed individuals.
