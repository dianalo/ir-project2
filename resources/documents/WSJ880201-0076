At a growing number of companies, stress is reaching such unhealthy levels that productivity and loyalty to the company suffers. Business consultants say it's all a byproduct of corporate streamlining and an uncertain business environment.    &quot;Senior managers are the toxic carriers of stress,&quot; says Robert Swain, president of Swain andamp; Swain, a New York outplacement firm. &quot;They're asking a reduced number of people to take on an unprecedented volume of work, and it's exhausting the staff's ability to cope.&quot;    Continued thinning of the ranks exacerbates stress. When Sandra Kresch, a Time Inc. executive, had to disband a staff of 100, she confronted everything from &quot;belligerent acts of sabotage and things disappearing to people compulsively asking, 'What did I do wrong?'&quot; Her energy level sagged. &quot;I was always tired during that period,&quot; she says.    Senior management often is nonchalant about such pressures. &quot;Deep down underneath, a lot of senior executives feel this is the way to test middle managers,&quot; says New York consultant Arnold Brown.    Still, stress management is an emerging personnel issue. Courses now are being offered to managers at some Fortune 500 companies. But to avoid cynics claiming the companies are to blame for the problem, courses often use terms like &quot;renewal&quot; and &quot;hardiness&quot; -- and avoid the word &quot;stress.&quot;    How Am I Doing?    Few Executives Know   THE HIGHER you move up the corporate ladder, the less you are likely to receive feedback on your performance.    In a recent study, Clinton Longenecker of the University of Toledo and Dennis Gioia of Pennsylvania State University found that just two of five top executives had received an annual evaluation despite company rules that they couldn't receive salary increases without them. And even when appraisals were given, they often were perfunctory: a short chat with few specific criticisms or suggestions.    &quot;Top people were kept in the dark and left anxious,&quot; says Mr. Longenecker. &quot;Without feedback, they didn't have personal objectives or clear lines of authority.&quot; Adds Mr. Gioia: &quot;Ultimately, lack of reviews hurts the bottom line because people who are anxious are less productive.&quot;    The reasons for lack of executive reviews include: a belief that the executives were too far up the ranks to need them and that their superiors either were too busy or too uncomfortable to provide them. Appraisals &quot;are one of the most uncomfortable duties of a boss,&quot; says Mr. Gioia.    But consultants argue that top executives whose decisions most affect their companies need evaluations the most. Robert Lefton, president of Psychological Associates Inc., St. Louis, recalls the division president of one manufacturer who was never told that his autocratic style was alienating subordinates. He was fired after his staff revolted and top company officials sided with them.    &quot;If his superiors had told him the damage his style was doing, he might have been able to change,&quot; says Mr. Lefton, noting that the executive was never able to land a comparable job. &quot;The battlefield is littered with executives whose lives have been hurt by the lack of good feedback.&quot;    An Outside Hire Works   For Firms in Flux   RECRUITING an outside manager to run a business unit can boost profits, especially if your company is growing rapidly or in a decline.    A study of 80 business units at large corporations by Strategic Planning Institute of Boston and the University of Michigan shows that outside talent outperforms managers promoted from within.    Rapidly expanding or contracting businesses where top managers came up through the ranks failed to meet profit goals by an average 15%, while outsiders exceeded their goals by 10%.    &quot;Outsiders are quicker to take risks in changing business situations,&quot; says Bradley T. Gale, the institute's managing director. Still, they face resentment from wary associates and may spend years building a loyal team.    In a mature, stable business, &quot;it probably doesn't matter if your managers are veterans or newcomers,&quot; adds Mr. Gale.    Candid Camera: CEOs   Seek 'In Charge' Pix   IT'S ANNUAL report picture-taking time again, a requirement few chief executives relish. Yet most seek a perfect snapshot that portrays them as both powerful and benevolent, photographers say.    To assure that image, most CEOs wear the familiar dress-for-success uniform of dark suit, white shirt, muted tie, and use their office or boardroom as the backdrop.    There are exceptions. One elderly chief executive at a conglomerate considered behind-the-times opted for a younger image. He wore a leather jacket and a hard hat and was snapped in a forest his company owned.    &quot;It worked,&quot; says photographer Arnold Newman, known for environmental portraits of executives.    Still, chief executive officers' instincts about a photo often are correct. Photographer Neil Selkirk recalls persuading Texas entrepreneur Ross Perot to do an outdoor photo session. &quot;He tried to dissuade me with stories about rattlesnakes and everything, but I prevailed. Yet he was right. I would have gotten a stronger portrait of him in his office,&quot; says Mr. Selkirk. </TEXT></DOC>
