MIDIA, a rebel-supported news organization, said insurgentsdowned three helicopter gunships last week as they were strafingrebel positions around Maimana, the capital of Afghanistan'snorthwestern Faryab province. It said all of the people aboard thehelicopters died but gave no death toll.   Pakistan-based MIDIA said about 40 government soldiers werekilled or captured.   Abdul Rahim, MIDIA director, also said two fighter-bombers wereshot down by rebel forces outside Baghlan city on the 200-mileSalang Highway that is the supply line between Kabul, the Afghancapital, and the Soviet Union.   Rahim said the two Soviet-supplied planes were downed by rebelswho captured Hasantal, a town near Baghlan, 115 miles north ofKabul.   He said the fighting in northern Afghanistan belies PresidentNajib's claims that rebel field commanders have made politicaldeals with the Marxist government.   ``Najib is claiming that fighting is just going on in the southand along the border, around Jalalabad, because of interferencefrom Pakistan'' said Rahim. ``But the fighting in the north provesthat it's not true and that the mujahedeen (rebels) have notreached any agreement with the government.''   The rebels, in 11 years of fighting successive Marxistgovernments, have been unable to capture a major city but controlmuch of the countryside.   There were predictions the Kabul government would collapse afterthe Soviet Union withdrew the last of its troops in February.   The Soviets sent troops into Afghanistan in 1979 to help thegovernment.</TEXT></DOC>
