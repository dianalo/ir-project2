DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former President Ford says he believesPresident Bush is being firm enough with Mikhail Gorbachev aboutLithuania for now, but he predicts the issue will continue tocomplicate U.S.-Soviet relations.   In an appearance Monday at the National Press Club, Ford alsosaid he believed Bush and the Soviet president established a warmand useful relationship during their summit in Washington, whichended Sunday.   Before the summit, Bush said he would ask Congress to approve aliberalized trade agreement with the Soviets only if Moscow droppedrestrictions on emigration and ended its partial economic blockadeof Lithuania.   After meeting with Gorbachev, however, he announced such anagreement and said it was linked only to emigration. He made nomention of the embargo on Lithuania, which Gorbachev imposed inretaliation for the Soviet republic's declaration of independence.   The Soviet legislature today postponed until at least Septemberadoption of a new emigration law that the United States says must bepassed before Washington will give Moscow preferential trade status.   Ford was asked whether he would have dealt more firmly withGorbachev on the Lithuanian question.   The former president said he had great admiration for the peopleof Lithuania and the other Baltic republics, noting that about10,000 Latvians emigrated after World War II to the Michigancongressional district that he represented before becoming vicepresident and then president.   ``So I start out with a sympathy for their desire to regain theirindependence,'' Ford said. ``At the same time, we have to have areasonable and balanced approach in the overall global context ofwhat this issue might be. So for the time at least I am going totake the point of view that President Bush is handling it properly.''   He said members of Congress ``very likely'' would try to blockthe trade agreement, but he did not know whether they would succeed.   ``The problem of the Baltic nations is going to be a verydifficult one for Mr. Gorbachev to solve, and it will be acontinuing problem between the government of the United States andthe Soviet Union,'' Ford said.</TEXT></DOC>
