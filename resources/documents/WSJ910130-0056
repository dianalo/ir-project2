SCE, holding company for Southern California Edison andamp; Co.,based in Rosemead, Calif., plans to spend about $150 milliona year on energy conservation, and now PGandamp;E says it willspend as much or more. &quot;No other utility has gone this farand laid out this kind of money,&quot; a PGandamp;E executive asserted.The company will unveil details of the plan this morning.</LP><TEXT>   The planned expenditures represent a triumph for bothenvironmentalists and state officials who for years urged thebig utility to increase its efforts to promote conservation.It likely wouldn't have occurred had the state not adoptedprograms during the past few years that allow the utility toprofit along with consumers as energy efficiency increases.   Under complicated formulas, the utility in effect gets toshare in the cost savings from power saved through theutility's programs. PGandamp;E officials said they expect toconserve as much as 2,500 megawatts of power through theprogram through 2001. A megawatt is enough electricity topower 1,000 households for one day. That amount of savingswould sharply reduce the number of new power plants orincreased capacity that PGandamp;E otherwise would have had to comeup with to meet power needs in its fast-growing service area,mainly in Northern and Southern California.   Executives said that the programs will allow the utilityto cut total oil consumption to the equivalent of 68 millionbarrels in the 10 years, thus providing 75% of the projectedpower that PGandamp;E would otherwise have to add to meet futuredemand. PGandamp;E said it will spend between $1.5 billion and $2billion on the conservation program in the next decade. Itsaid it will spend $149 million this year. Much of theexpenditures will come through an extensive program ofrebates and incentive payments aimed at getting consumers touse more energy-efficient appliances.   For example, PGandamp;E will rebate $7 of the standard $12 costof 18-watt flourescent bulbs, which produce as much light asa 75-watt bulb but lasts much longer and uses 75% less energyover its life. The company also will pay builders fordesigning homes for better energy use and installinghigh-efficiency appliances. It also will fund moreeducational programs and research; for example, it cited a$10 million study of new energy-saving technology it isfunding for environmental and scientific groups including theNatural Resources Defense Council, which over the years hassometimes been an adversary of the big utility.   PGandamp;E currently serves about 11 million customers. Intrading on the New York Stock Exchange, it closed yesterdayat $25.125 a share, down 12.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
