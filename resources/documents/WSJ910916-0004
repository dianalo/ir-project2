Following the Fed's move Friday morning to cut the ratesit controls to levels that haven't been seen since the 1970s,several big banks reduced their prime lending rates to 8%.Other banks are likely to follow as early as today, loweringborrowing costs for many small businesses and for consumerswith home equity loans.</LP><TEXT>   Interest rates in financial markets -- which affecteverything from home mortgages to corporate borrowing costs-- had fallen in enthusiastic anticipation of the Fed move,and didn't respond much more to the actual reduction.   The Fed cut its highly visible discount rate, the rate itcharges on loans to financial institutions, by one-halfpercentage point to 5%, the lowest level since February 1973.Shortly afterward, the Fed nudged down the more significantfederal funds rate, which banks charge on loans to eachother, by one-quarter percentage point to 5 1/4%.   Officials familiar with Fed deliberations said the movehad been under discussion for some time. Each new nugget ofnews about the sluggishness of consumer demand, financialmarkets and the money supply weakened lingering oppositionwithin the central bank. By the time Fed Chairman AlanGreenspan initiated a telephone conference call to consultwith other policy makers Friday morning there was littleopposition to cutting rates.   The discount rate is controlled exclusively by the Fedgovernors in Washington, and the chairman has the leeway tocut the federal funds rate by a quarter of a point without avote of the Fed's open market committee, which also includespresidents of the district Federal Reserve banks.   The recent behavior of the money supply was particularlyimportant in the decision, in part because it is closelytracked by some of those at the Fed who have been reluctantto cut rates in the past. &quot;I have been troubled by theslowness of monetary growth this year,&quot; said Lee Hoskins,president of the Cleveland Federal Reserve Bank and ahard-line advocate of reducing the inflation rate to zero,&quot;and would like to see it return to the average of the lastthree or four years.&quot;   The most important money supply measure, known as M2,dropped sharply in the week ended Sept. 2. Despite somerecent upward revisions, M2 has grown only 2.4% so far thisyear, below the bottom end of the Fed's target range of 2.5%to 6.5%. The slow growth of the money supply has perplexedFed economists, who repeatedly have predicted a pickup inmoney growth. (M2 includes currency, checking accounts, somesavings accounts and money-market funds.)   In announcing the discount-rate move, the Fed pointedfirst to &quot;weakness&quot; in the money supply and then noted &quot;theimproving inflation environment&quot; and &quot;concerns about theongoing strength of the economic expansion.&quot; A top Fedofficial said policy makers aren't concerned so much aboutthe current state of the economy, which is improving slowly,as they are about assuring that the economy remains healthylater this year and early next.   The Bush administration and congressional Democratsapplauded the Fed's action, and pleaded for more of the same.Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady said, &quot;I hope this will befollowed by similar moves by the Fed.&quot; Senate BankingCommittee Chairman Donald Riegle (D., Mich.) termed the Fedmove &quot;long overdue&quot; and questioned &quot;whether this step will beenough.&quot;   Minutes after the Fed announcement, Morgan Guaranty TrustCo., a unit of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., reduced its prime rate byone-half percentage point to 8%, the lowest that rate hasbeen since May 1987. Other banks followed later in the day.But Sen. Riegle was quick to complain that the last time theFed's discount rate was at 5%, the banks' prime rate was 6%.   &quot;The erosion of profitability {has} led to differentattitudes&quot; than in the past, said Norman Robertson, chiefeconomist at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh. As a result, thedifference between the rate that banks pay on deposits andthe prime rate is unusually large.   Consumer loan rates may not fall as much as the prime rateas bankers continue to try to build their profit margins.Robert Heady, president of Bank Rate Monitor, said banks havereduced the rates they pay on short-term deposits by morethan half a percentage point since they last cut the primerate in May. But the rates banks charge on auto loans andunsecured personal loans have fallen by only about one-thirdof a percentage point and the rates on credit cards havehardly moved at all.   Rates banks pay savers will continue to fall. Mr. Headypredicted that rates banks pay on short-term deposits willfall between a fifth and a quarter of a percentage point inthe next six to eight weeks.   With the economy clearly in recession and Congress finallyenacting a deficit-reduction law, the Fed began aggressivelypushing down the federal funds rate last October. With thekey rate at 5 3/4%, the Fed paused in April and didn't make amove until early August, when it nudged the rate down anotherquarter percentage point.   All four of the Fed's governors who were in Washingtonvoted in favor of cutting the discount rate, including WayneAngell who opposed a similar move in April. Fed governorEdward Kelley would have voted to reduce the rate had he beenpresent, the Fed said. Seven of the 12 Fed district banks hadpetitioned for a cut in the discount rate.</TEXT></DOC>
