Although the number of people in the three businesses isonly 120, the move represents a retreat by Citicorp frommarkets that were booming when the bank concern entered themin the late 1980s but have withered in the past two years.</LP><TEXT>   Problems in Citicorp's loan portfolio are forcing the bankcompany to retreat from some areas of investment banking justas healthier bank companies such as J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. andBankers Trust New York Corp. are winning expandedstock-underwriting powers from the Federal Reserve.   In an announcement to employees late yesterday, Citicorpsaid it would &quot;redeploy the resources of these stand-aloneunits by integrating them into business activity centersmanaging client relationships in geographical and specializedindustry areas.&quot;   A Citicorp executive said a majority of the people nowworking in those areas are likely to remain with the bank,and added that some of them might replace other employeesalready working in those geographical and industry areas.   On Jan. 22, Mr. Reed said he aims to cut $1.5 billion inannual costs at Citicorp, nearly double an $800 million goalhe had set last December, as part of an effort to strengthenthe bank's capital.   Citicorp is one of three major New York bank companies toenter the junk-bond business in the past few years, only tosee the market for new public issues of high-yield bondsdisappear almost entirely. The other bank companies are J.P.Morgan and Bankers Trust.   The junk-bond business cited in the Citicorp announcementapparently included only financing -- not research, sales andtrading. However, one person familiar with the company'splans said research, sales and trading are likely to undergosimilar changes soon. A Citicorp spokesman couldn't bereached to clarify that situation.   The corporate finance advisory business being disbandedincludes investment bankers who have advised on leveragedtransactions, but not bankers who make loan decisions.Neither that group nor the mergers advisory group had ahigh-profile presence on Wall Street.   However, the high-yield group ranked among the top fiveunderwriters of junk-bond private placements in 1990, sellingabout $500 million of such high-risk, high-yield bonds.Although the ranking was high, the dollar total was tinycompared with the late-1980s heyday of junk-bond megadeals.   Yesterday's announcement said Citicorp was making the move&quot;as part of an overall effort to reduce costs and betterrealign market resources against market opportunity.&quot; TheCiticorp executive said, &quot;The business level no longersupports three separate individual units.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
