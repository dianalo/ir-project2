(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 200 faithful followers and a fewcurious tourists attended services at Jim and Tammy Bakker'sshopping center church-studio Sunday, but the convicted evangelistand his wife were absent.   ``Reverend and Mrs. Bakker are resting today from the rigorousordeal of the trial,'' said the Rev. Gene Kennett, a Pennsylvaniaevangelist who has been filling in for the television evangelists.   Bakker, convicted last week of bilking his PTL ministryfollowers of $3.7 million, returned with his wife to his rentedOrlando home Saturday. Windows at the house were soaped over toensure no one could see inside.   Bakker, scheduled to be sentenced Oct. 24, faces up to 120 yearsin prison and $5 million in fines on 24 counts of fraud andconspiracy. He was accused of raising $158 million by oversellingtime-shares or lodging guarantees, called ``lifetimepartnerships,'' at PTL's Heritage USA retreat near Charlotte, N.C..   Reporters were kept outside Sunday's service while worshiperswere welcomed with handshakes and handed addressed envelopes tosend donations to Jim and Tammy Ministries Inc.   Some who emerged from the nearly two-hour service said it wasfilled with pleas for money, but others said the call was more forhope than handouts.   ``As far as I'm concerned, nothing's changed. I will still givemoney to Jim anytime he needs it,'' said Myrna Coppersmith, a13-year PTL partner who followed Bakker when he moved his ministryhere earlier this year.   ``I feel Jim has been betrayed,'' she said. ``When all the factscome out, Jim will be a free man.''   But another follower, a Lakeland woman who said she had been aPTL member for 12 years but refused to give her name, disagreed.   ``You have to be realistic and accept the jury's verdict,'' shesaid. ``It's like a death in the family and I was hoping this wouldbe the funeral.''   Ushers had to put extra seats in the back of the tinycombination church and television studio to accomodate the tourists.   ``It's just a big show,'' said Irma de la Cruz of San Juan,Puerto Rico, who said she came out of curiousity. ``This confirmswhat I've always felt _ there's not much religion in thisministry.''   Bakker's attorney has said the Orlando ministry will besuspended indefinitely but Kennett said it will continue ``with thehelp of the partners.''</TEXT></DOC>
