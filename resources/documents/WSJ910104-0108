Simplifying the use of VCRs means owners will probablyrecord more shows and zap more ads hitting the fast-forwardbutton during playback. Increased zapping &quot;could translateinto a sizable amount of wasted advertising dollars, giventhat television is a $27 billion industry,&quot; warned a recentreport on VCRs by WPP Group's Ogilvy andamp; Mather agency.</LP><TEXT>   Although seven of 10 U.S. households now own VCRs, peopleuse them much more to watch rented movies than to tape TVshows for later viewing. In fact, VCR owners spend only 1 1/2hours a week -- 3% of their total TV viewing -- watchingprograms they have recorded, according to an A.C. Nielsensurvey. This scant usage generally is blamed on thedifficulty of programming the machines.   That may change soon. Three devices now hitting the marketor under development will greatly simplify the programming ofVCRs.   In late November, Gemstar Development started selling VCRPlus+, a handheld remote device that lets viewers easily setVCRs to tape a TV show by punching in a code number. ThePasadena, Calif., company says sales already are running atan annual rate of more than three million units -- triple itsoriginal first-year goal -- even though nationwide marketingwon't begin until June.   InSight Telecast, a Palo Alto, Calif., start-up partlyowned by Japan's giant Sumitomo Corp., will introduce a moreelaborate system early next year that enables viewers tosummon a week's TV listings on their screens and then recorda show by pushing one remote-control button. The system,which comes as part of a special VCR, will be able to followinstructions even if a TV program begins late or runs long.And Matsushita Electric Industrial, maker of Panasonic,Quasar and other electronics brands, says it has developed aVCR that a user can program with voice instructions.   A small Nielsen study suggests VCR users currently ignore40% of the commercials they record -- either because theyfail to play back programs or they fast-forward through adson programs they play back. That isn't surprising,considering that viewer antipathy toward TV commercialscontinues to rise.   Two-thirds of 1,000 viewers polled last year by VideoStoryboard Tests said they prefer television without anycommercials -- up from 53% in 1985. And consumers' ability torecall TV spots has dropped steadily since 1987, according toanother survey by the ad-research firm.   The possibility of increased zapping &quot;is something that wedefinitely are monitoring,&quot; says Kevin Burns, Ogilvy andamp;Mather's manager of broadcast and new-technology research.&quot;There's a challenge for both advertisers and broadcasters&quot;to reduce the ad clutter, he adds, so viewers &quot;won't want toskip over commercials.&quot;   To maintain the impact of television advertising,advertising agencies may have to revamp commercial-productiontechniques. A viewer fast-forwarding through a 30-second spotoften sees it for four seconds at best. &quot;We are going to haveto develop the perfect four-second commercial,&quot; says JerryDella Femina, chairman of Della Femina, McNamee.   His idea isn't as far-fetched as it sounds. Some agenciesalready are considering making spots in which a brand logoappears clearly only during those fast-forwarded fourseconds, appearing in the background at regular speed.Agencies also may start to shoot entire commercials &quot;at avery slow speed, so when you fastforward, you will see themas regular commercials,&quot; says David Vadehra, president ofVideo Storyboard Tests.   Marcella Rosen, Ayer media-services director, expects thatadvertisers will try to attract VCR users by designingcommercials with more &quot;supers&quot; -- words flashed on the screenand noticeable during zapping. &quot;There is some communicationvalue even in a fast-forwarded commercial,&quot; Ms. Rosen says.   Other media specialists anticipate a heavier emphasis onhighly entertaining commercials that grab people's attentionright away. Spots &quot;will be much more arresting,&quot; says PeterKim, a senior vice president and consumer-behavior directorat J. Walter Thompson, another WPP unit. &quot;You want to stop(viewers) before they get into zipping forward&quot; pastcommercials.   But manufacturers such as Gemstar say their new devicesshould benefit TV advertisers -- by expanding VCR owners'total exposure to commercials as they increasingly tapebroadcasts rather than just watch rented movies. At thispoint, nobody knows for sure. &quot;All this,&quot; says Ayer's Ms.Rosen, &quot;is just so new.&quot;   ---   Wooing Leisure Renters                                                                                                          Hertz Corp. has begun a major new ad campaign featuring asmiling animated bus promising reliable service tovacationing families and other leisure renters.   The campaign marks Hertz's latest move in its bid tocapture a bigger share of vacationers' car-rental dollars. Asan announcer says &quot;the real bargain is the company behind thecar,&quot; the cheerful bus follows a family-packed rental caralong a Florida highway, waving at one point. At another, thebus gets up on its back wheels and snaps a photo of thefamily. The ad features the firm's ad theme: &quot;Hertz. We'reAmerica's Wheels.&quot;   The bus was created by London production company PassionPictures, which also did animation work on the film &quot;WhoFramed Roger Rabbit.&quot; The campaign was developed by Wells,Rich, Greene.   In the past, Hertz has focused its marketing efforts onthe business traveler. Last year, it did run one ad wooingvacationers, but this campaign is seen as the firm's boldesteffort yet directed at leisure renters. &quot;We believe that evenin a soft economy, vacation travel within the U.S. will doquite well,&quot; said Brian Kennedy, executive vice president ofmarketing for Hertz, a unit of Park Ridge Corp.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .
