Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., the nation's biggestbrokerage firm, earned record profit in the first ninemonths, but its compensation-and-benefit costs also soared by24% through September. Morgan Stanley Group Inc.'s payrollcosts rose 28% in the same period.   Industrywide, compensation costs will rise about 16% thisyear, to $20.5 billion, according to a study by theSecurities Industry Association, a trade group. That's anaverage of $95,000 per Wall Street employee, but of courselower-level workers make much less.</LP><TEXT>   The trend threatens to undermine Wall Street's &quot;new-foundgrip on costs,&quot; says researcher George Monahan of the SIA.&quot;Over the past three years, much has been done {to trim pay}.But these costs are on the rise again,&quot; the association warnsin its new study on Wall Street trends.   Aside from the compensation issue, the securitiesassociation paints a rosy picture of Wall Street's profits.The study, titled &quot;Back in the Black,&quot; says that thesecurities industry &quot;is on target to match 1986's recordpretax profit of $5.5 billion on a record $60 billion ofrevenues.&quot; (The figures reflect the 322 New York StockExchange-member brokerage firms that deal with the public.)The only declines were in commodity revenues and interestincome from margin accounts.   Brokerage firms are &quot;doing a decent job&quot; holding downcompensation costs, but &quot;the momentum to actually cut costsseems to be gone,&quot; says Guy Moszkowski, brokerage-industryanalyst at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. &quot;When times cease to beso tough and revenues come in again, people's focus seems todrift from cost-cutting and management to revenuegeneration.&quot;   Wall Street executives insist they continue to count theirbeans carefully. &quot;My instinct is that the experience ofrecent years is still fresh in the minds of managers,&quot; saysFrank Zarb, chairman of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., thebrokerage unit of Primerica Corp. &quot;And I doubt we're seeingthe uncontrolled expansion that sometimes takes place in goodperiods.&quot; The number of people on Smith Barney's payroll hasremained steady the past year, though like other firms it isstarting to hire more stockbrokers.   Analysts get nervous when Wall Street shows signs ofexpansiveness. That's why compensation costs, the industry'sbiggest expense item aside from interest, are so closelywatched.   Since the 1987 stock-market crash, brokerage firms havefired one in five employees, returning industry employment to1984 levels. But Wall Street still overpays itself, manyanalysts say. One reason is that the pay of investmentbankers and brokers is often tied to revenue, not actualprofit. So, whenever business picks up, the added revenuesimmediately transfer into fatter paychecks.   Mr. Monahan says that Wall Street needs to institute more&quot;profit-based&quot; (rather than revenue-based) compensationplans. It also needs to tie compensation to the firm'soverall performance, use stock instead of cash bonuses andtake other steps such as tying broker pay to the success ofhis or her clients, he says.   Top executives of the brokerage firms are certainlyenjoying fatter paychecks. At Bear Stearns Cos., where profitrose 20% in its fiscal year ended June, the chairman and thepresident each received 26% pay increases; the pay of 13 topexecutives averaged $2.8 million. Similar big increases areexpected at Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley and other brokeragefirms when they release their year-end proxy statements.   Merrill's 24% jump in compensation costs came as mostother expenses fell. The compensation costs soaked up 53.4%of net revenue -- the only major expense item to eat up morerevenue this year than last year.   Merrill, like other major brokerage firms, is doling outmore money than in past years for new incentive plans put inplace after the crash. When the firms are posting betterprofits, the plans require them to reward employeesaccordingly. In the third quarter, the ratio of compensationto net revenues at Merrill rose to 53.5% from 53% in thesecond quarter.   Herb Allison, Merrill's finance chief, says thecompensation rise &quot;is totally insignificant,&quot; representing $9million out of total compensation expense of $954 million. Itreflects accounting adjustments and an increase in commissionpayouts for some top-producing brokers. He adds thateveryone, including shareholders, benefit during good times.But, &quot;if Merrill Lynch is less profitable, our employees willreceive less rewards as well.&quot;   There are few areas that aren't cooking on Wall Streetthese days. Commission revenues are up 16%, trading gains 18%and stock-and-bond underwriting revenues 40%.   With the revival in small stocks, the securitiesassociation study says, over-the-counter trading gains willexceed $2 billion this year, 53% ahead of last year's paceand 14% above 1987's record level.   National, regional and discount-brokerage firms are allheaded toward a record profit year, the study says. Thediscounters, in fact, may nearly double their record profitsof 1986. Overall, the first two quarters of 1991 were thesixth and eighth best quarters ever, respectively, for WallStreet profits. With the better times, Wall Street'spost-crash consolidation -- mergers of brokerage firms andfirings of employees -- &quot;appears to have bottomed out.&quot;   Jeffrey Schaefer, the securities association's researchdirector, says there aren't too many large-scale cutbacksleft to make on Wall Street. The big revenue gains this yearhave come from the new-issue market and trading, &quot;and I don'tthink there's that much excess capacity in those areas,&quot; hesays.   So is Wall Street out of its four-year, post-crashrecession? &quot;I think we are,&quot; says Mr. Schaefer. &quot;I don'tthink we're in a euphoria period. We're in the recoverystage.&quot;   Edward O'Brien, the securities association president, justreturned from visiting 17 Midwest brokerage firms. He saysthat no one is getting carried away yet. &quot;Don't ask me toprove it because I can't, but I feel the optimism is a morebalanced optimism&quot; than in Wall Street's pre-crash years, hesays. &quot;It is not a wild euphoria. I really believe the fellasare managing their activities better they have for a long,long time.&quot;   There certainly aren't hiring binges going on at any majorbrokerage firms. But most of them are adding to theirbrokerage ranks for the first time in recent years.   Brokerage firms' commodities operations are one of the fewareas that haven't joined the party. Revenues from tradingoil, gold and other commodities are down 24% from last year,to $1.28 billion. Dull markets and declining prices are toblame. Futures and options volume on U.S. commodity exchangesis down 7.2% through September.   Another weak point is private placements, where thisyear's volume may be the lowest since 1985. Privateplacements are securities sold, without registration with theSecurities and Exchange Commission, to large, sophisticatedinvestors. Many issuers favored the public markets this year.One growth area within private placements are offerings doneunder the SEC's Rule 144a, which made it easier for foreignissuers to tap the U.S. markets; such deals account for 14%of this year's private-placement volume.   Wall Street's robust 1991 profits contrast with lastyear's $162 million pretax loss, the first since 1973. Totalcapital also &quot;fell to a post-crash nadir&quot; last year and thenumber of Big Board member firms (322) was the lowest onrecord, the securities-association study says. A reflectionon these recent Wall Street woes is in order, it added,&quot;before we march down optimistic primrose paths.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
