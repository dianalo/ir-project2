An order for about 40 of the planes, valued at between $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, is expected soon from GPA Rolls Ltd., a new company formed specifically to buy and lease 757s, according to industry executives. The venture's partners include London-based Rolls-Royce Ltd., which makes more than half the engines flown in 757s around the world, and closely held GPA Group Ltd., the aircraft-leasing concern based in Shannon, Ireland.    The order is expected to include options for an additional 40 jets, which would double its indicated value. &quot;We're negotiating with Boeing, but we haven't actually decided how many we're going to place,&quot; said Ken Holden, senior vice president of GPA Group.    &quot;It's going to be comparable to the American and United 757 deals,&quot; he added, a reference to the recent purchase of 50 of the aircraft by AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and 30 by UAL Corp.'s United Airlines. Those orders included options for an additional 50 and 30 planes, respectively.    Boeing, which for accounting purposes assumes that all its new aircraft programs will break even at the 400th delivery, declined to comment. A spokesman said the Seattle-based aerospace giant was &quot;pleased that the joint venture is so interested in the 757.&quot; The aircraft can each carry between 186 and 228 passengers.    Howard A. Rubel, an aerospace industry analyst with C.J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., said future 757 orders will bring Boeing an additional reported profit of between $3 million and $5 million per plane, which represents certain tooling and excess production costs that will no longer be amortized.    Boeing has been taking orders for the plane since 1978, but has been slow in recovering the $3 billion it invested in the joint 757-767 development program since then. &quot;This plane has stopped being a sleeper and is now a go,&quot; Mr. Rubel said.    The expected deal with GPA Rolls would come on the heels of the sale of six 757s last week to another leasing company, Ansett Worldwide Aviation Services, based in Australia, bringing the total of 757s currently under firm order to 366.    Boeing booked about a third of those orders since the beginning of this year, when airlines and leasing companies began a buying spree to replace their aging 727 models and to add capacity to accommodate increased demand. The 757, which has two engines and carries a crew of two, is about 35% cheaper to operate than the three-engine 727, which carries a three-member crew.    Additional orders for the 757 may be on the way. Steven Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease Finance Corp., said the Beverly Hills, Calif., leasing company is negotiating with Boeing to acquire an additional 20 of the jets. A Boeing spokesman said International Lease already has ordered 18 of the planes, of which four have been delivered. </TEXT></DOC>
