CORNELL</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   Ever since humans began, they've looked for something to blamefor their problems. Adam and Eve blamed the ``serpent.''Psychiatrists blame childhood traumas. Astrologists lay it to theplanets. Anything but self.   Now comes an emerging new culprit: the ``genome.''   The genome is the full set of genes, or inherited bodilyregulators that determine much of a person's makeup. But just howmuch is a question that casts a shadow on the essence of humanityitself.   The ``mystery of the gene is stimulating a new era ofphilosophical and theological thinking about the nature'' of humanlife, said the Rev. J. Robert Nelson, a noted theologian, ecumenistand specialist in scientific ethics.   The issue impinges directly on concepts of faith, God, humanorigins, behavior, sin and morality, he said.   To the extent that it is established that genes not only controlphysical characteristics but also fix certain behavioral traitswould to that degree contradict ``free will andself-determination,'' he said.   That freedom to decide on one's own conduct and course of actionis the basis of individual responsibility and a central biblicalview of humanity's special dignity and distinction from othercreatures.   Nelson, director of the Institute of Religion at the TexasMedical Center in Houston, said in a telephone interview: ``If itis conceded that genetics determines almost the total person, thenthere's nothing left for morality.   ``But I don't think it will go that far. We do have free will.It's the old question of how much nature or nurture has to do witha person.''   Nevertheless, he said the power of the genome to govern humancharacteristics and dispositions is turning up increasingly, andreligious institutions should come to grips with that reality.   ``I wonder why moral theologians are not pursuing it,'' he said.He has initiated a three-year project on ``Genetics, Religion andEthics'' to spur inquiry into the area.   A first conference of molecular biologists, doctors, theologiansand public policy makers has been scheduled for March 30. It isco-sponsored by the American Medical Association, the NationalCouncil of Churches and the World Council of Churches, plus about10 denominations.   ``The whole threat of sociobiology is that we have no free willat all, that we simply do what our genes tell us to do,'' Nelsonsaid.   If they ``are the rule of life,'' he added, ``we're going tohave a lot of questions for traditional norms. How much flexibilityshould there be in moral standards, if some behavior isuncontrollable?''   He said evidence is mounting of genetic causes not only ofphysical makeup and a growing list of diseases and susceptibilityto others, but also of ``predermined patterns of personalbehavior.''   Some of these are psychopathic, such as schizophrenia and manicdepression, he said, but people also may be ``geneticallydisposed'' or even ``genetically determined'' to alcoholism orsexual deviation.   Kleptomania, compulsive stealing, also may be geneticallycaused, and perhaps even gambling, he said, while ``compulsiveinclination toward violent and criminal activity'' is argued amonggeneticists.   All this raises the question of the extent to which good orobjectional behavior is ``due to free choice'' or ``due to ourgenomes.''   Some ``hard-line dogmatism'' in the field maintains that ``ourtraditional concepts of human free will, voluntary choice, decisionmaking and ethical rectitude are merely illusions,'' he said.   To reject this ``extreme ideology'' must not ``make us blind to... the range of genetic effects on human behavior,'' he said, andthe search to understand them is ``as mandatory as it is awesome.''   That search goes on in a longtime tension between two opposingnotions of human life, the ``materialistics,'' viewing it as onlyphysical matter, and the ``spiritual,'' seeing its essence as theeternal soul or mind.   Biblical insights see humanity as combined body and soul, a``psychosomatic'' whole.   While in the present environment the materialistic theory oflife seems to prevail, it is contradicted by ``emerging data ofgenetic science itself,'' Nelson said, adding:   ``Research in molecular biology and biochemistry is rapidlydiscovering heretofore unknown characteristics of the DNA moleculeas the quintessential unit of life. And the new knowledge givessupport and comfort to both the materialists and the idealists.''   He said that underlying the chemical interaction making up thegenetic unit is the source of energy itself and an emerging theoryin physics that ``energy and matter are themselves the products ofan immaterial force.''   Thus basically, genetic science may give ``signals both to theconsistent materialists and the idealists that they are right,'' hesaid. ``However, there is a plausible truth in the intuition thathuman life is an inseparable admixture of material and spiritualdimensions.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Fri AMs, Jan. 19</NOTE></DOC>
