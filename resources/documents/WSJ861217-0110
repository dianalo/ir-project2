Some headline writers and fellow scandal nicknamers have adopted variations on Watergate (Contragate), and others have strained for originality (Tehransfer), but so far nothing has stuck. &quot;It's hard to get a handle on,&quot; says Frank Van Riper, Washington news editor of the New York Daily News, one of several news groups running Name That Scandal contests.    Judging by a contest at WCLY-FM radio in Washington, however, the front-runner is Iranscam, or sometimes Iran$cama variation on Abscam, the name the Federal Bureau of Investigation gave its investigation into government corruption. USA Today and Time magazine are among publications using that, but many editors hesitate to pay tribute to the creativity of the FBI. Still, &quot;you probably won't get tired of hearing it,&quot; says Allan Hotlen, program director at WCLY-FM. Runners-up were Contradeception and Ollie's Follies. Also rans: Reagan-armics, Ayatollah Payola and Gipper's Gap.    This newspaper hasn't ventured beyond &quot;Iran-Contra crisis.&quot; And the Washington Post says it sticks to &quot;The Reagan Administration's Secret Arms Deal.&quot;    Britain's Economist wins praise for &quot;Iragua.&quot; &quot;It has enormous flexibility. It could become Irangola, Iranistan or Iranjersey, depending on where these arms turned up,&quot; says Anne Groer, Washington correspondent for the Orlando Sentinel.    Ms. Groer is lobbying for her own creation, though: Iran-a-Lam-a-Ding-Dong, a variation on a 1950s rock 'n' roll number.    Some journalists find all the name-calling distasteful. According to ABC News Vice President Jeff Gralnick, who coordinates Iran-scandal coverage, ABC hasn't used any &quot;cuted-up&quot; phrases. &quot;It's a very complicated story,&quot; Mr. Gralnick says. Still, each morning ABC editors and reporters plan their Iran coverage through internal memos they call Iranograms.    The New Republic magazine perhaps has been having the most fun with the name debate. The magazine says it got 265 entries in four days to its naming contest. &quot;Entries ending in '-gate' or '-scam' will not be considered. It's time to move on,&quot; stated the strict rules. Readers suggested Contraband, Contraception, Contradiction and such phrases as Where's the Chief?, Dutch Fudge and Saudi Night Fever.    First prize went to Ann D. Davis of L'Anse, Mich., whose winning entry will be announced this week.    Sources say it's Iranamok. </TEXT></DOC>
