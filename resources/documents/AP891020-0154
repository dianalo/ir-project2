Many aid officials had felt increased diplomatic efforts put asettlement within reach, but an international conference in Parisin June did not resolve the civil war, which began with theVietnamese invasion of December 1978.   About 300,000 of the Cambodians who fled the brutal Khmer Rougeregime or the invasion that ended it remain in the U.N.-assistedcamps.   Fighting nearby has intensified since Vietnamese soldiers leftCambodia late in September, and Boegli said the camps are exposedto increased danger.   ``Do we have to fear a full-fledged attack on the camps?'' hesaid. ``Of course this possibilty has to remain part of oursecurity planning.''   He said the presence of guerrillas in the camps increased thedanger.   The United Nations recently reduced food aid to the largestcamp, Site 2, on grounds the rebels were diverting supplies totheir own use. Khmer Rouge guerrillas control the camp, whichhouses 140,000 refugees.   Although repatriation may be delayed, aid agencies still mustprepare for it, said S.A.M.S. Kibria, U.N. special representativefor Cambodian refugees.   ``The time has come to look beyond our established role ofproviding basic emergency relief and consider greater emphasis onsocial program to support and rebuild'' Cambodian society, he said.   ``There are children as old as 10 or 12 ... who have never knownlife outside a refugee camp,'' Kibria said, and the longer theyremain, ``the more serious becomes the risk that ... we will returnto Cambodia whole communities of socially handicapped personsunable to earn a living or readjust to conditions in their owncountry.''   Kibria said more money was needed to finance reintegrationprograms.   He also expressed concern about reports that guerrillas may moverefugees back into Cambodia without involving internationalorganizations.   ``Any movement of the population into Cambodia which lacks theassurances of safety and freedom of choice cannot be supported,''he said.   Toshiyuki Niwa, director of the U.N. Border Relief Operation,said the breakdown of peace talks could increase frustration amongthe refugees in camps already plagued by murder, rape and othercrimes.</TEXT></DOC>
