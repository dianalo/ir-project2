But since Ms. Brown arrived, circulation has nearly doubled to more than 400,000 copies monthly. Last month, Adweek magazine placed Vanity Fair at the top of its &quot;Ten Hottest&quot; magazines of 1986. In a year when many consumer magazines had declines in advertising revenue and pages, Vanity Fair's advertising sales rose 69.7% and the number of advertising pages increased 38.6%.    &quot;With publisher Douglas Johnston and his staff aggressively selling the cachet of Tina Brown's editorial product, (Vanity Fair) looks to be securing its grip on a lucrative niche,&quot; observed Adweek.    Both Mr. Johnston and S.I. Newhouse, whose closely held publishing empire includes Conde Nast, credit Ms. Brown with turning around a magazine many in publishing expected to fold shortly after she arrived. &quot;We were baffled, struggling to get the right combination of people, editorial and circulation philosophy,&quot; says Mr. Newhouse. &quot;Vanity Fair was waiting for the right editor, and from the time she came in it was clear she was capable of taking the Vanity Fair idea and updating and restating it.&quot;    Ms. Brown's editorial product, he adds, &quot;is much closer to what I had in mind&quot; when he decided to relaunch the legendary monthly as a new publication. Vanity Fair had flourished between 1914 and 1936 as the bible of the rich, literary and sophisticated, but was folded into Conde Nast's Vogue magazine. The relaunch was among the most ballyhooed publishing debuts of the decade. Mr. Johnston, the publisher, says advertisers lined up to get in the first issue. &quot;We expected 50 to 55 pages of advertising and got 168,&quot; he says. &quot;It was like fantasy land.&quot;    But the fantasy soon turned sour. Advertisers balked at the ponderous, stilted editorial style of the magazine; critics say its first editor, Richard Locke, tended to feature lengthy, intellectual stories and arty but incomprehensible photo essays. A second editor didn't help things much; by July 1984, three months after Ms. Brown arrived, Mr. Johnston says advertisers were so disgusted that the magazine carried only 14 pages of advertising. &quot;We just lost all credibility,&quot; he says.    Vanity Fair has regained much of its credibility with both advertisers and subscribers, as is apparent from its impressive sales and page gains. Those gains are heavily weighted in the cosmetic and fashion categories; Mr. Johnston acknowledges the magazine has had trouble attracting the more staid corporate advertisers it seeks.    Mr. Newhouse, meanwhile, says that he expects seven to eight years of losses in total at Vanity Fair, &quot;but it's now possible to find a time in the future where we can make Vanity Fair into a self-sustaining publication.&quot; Mr. Newhouse says the magazine will carry about 700 pages of advertising this year, and it needs about 1,000 pages per year &quot;before it can hold its own.&quot; But he says the growth in circulation and the &quot;growing awareness of the magazine&quot; under Ms. Brown's reign should help Vanity Fair meet his goals.    Ms. Brown caught Mr. Newhouse's eye as editor of London's sassy, irreverent Tatler magazine, which Conde Nast purchased in 1982. Initially acting as a consultant to Vanity Fair, she says she found early issues &quot;pretentious and intellectual, and visually a zoo.&quot; She acknowledges that many of the magazine's pieces were good, but were so long that &quot;nobody wanted to wade through them,&quot; and there were almost no short features to lighten the magazine.    After becoming editor, Ms. Brown quickly overhauled the magazine, buffering essay-length pieces with short, gossipy pieces looking at &quot;the more vulgar elements of popular culture in a tongue-in-cheek way,&quot; aiming at readers she describes as &quot;the goers out, the first nighters, the hot-cutting edge people.&quot; Critics assailed the new Vanity Fair as superficial and celebrity-oriented; one skeptic called it &quot;a People magazine for people who read,&quot; recalls the publisher, Mr. Johnston.    On the editorial side, Ms. Brown scored such coups as getting the Reagans to pose for a black-tie photo session, including a cover picture of the dancing couple kicking up their heels. She has also stirred up controversy with such pieces as her own critical jab at the Princess of Wales as a shrewish, self-absorbed &quot;Mouse that Roared.&quot; Ms. Brown likes to hobnob with the literati and other celebrities herself, and acknowledges that Vanity Fair often interferes with her own social relationships. After a scathing review of Washington reporter-turned-hostess Sally Quinn's novel &quot;Regrets Only,&quot; Ms. Brown says Ms. Quinn sent her a note by express mail disinviting her to a coming party, &quot;and we've never spoken since.&quot;    More recently, the magazine has won attention for such articles as this month's essay on the decimating effect of acquired immune deficiency syndrome on the world of fashion and the arts. Ms. Brown decided to run photos of 50 men and women in those fields who had died of the disease, including several whose families hadn't previously acknowledged it. Geoffrey Stokes, media critic for the Village Voice and a frequent critic of Vanity Fair, grudgingly called the piece both &quot;tasteful and important,&quot; though he noted those &quot;are not terms usually used in connection with Tina Brown.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
