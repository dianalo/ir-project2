Rep. Butler Derrick, D-S.C., in a letter to Energy SecretaryJames D. Watkins on Tuesday, wondered about the truth of thedepartment's announcement last week that it was putting the FuelMaterials Facility on ``backup status'' for economic reasons.   ``If this announcement raises questions in my mind, itpractically begs the media and congressional oversight committees tomaul the Department of Energy again,'' Derrick wrote, adding hewanted a full explanation from Watkins.   ``As you know, speculation has it that the Savannah River Sitenaval fuel production facility has experienced operationaldifficulties resulting from design flaws,'' he wrote.   The facility, part of the 300-square-mile Savannah River Sitenuclear weapons complex near Aiken, S.C., is one of two plantsproducing uranium fuel for naval reactors. Derrick said themothballed plant was completed at a cost of $175 million.   The department said it was halting production at the facility``because the projected demand for fuel no longer justifies the costof operating two facilities.''   The other production site is at Erwin, Tenn., and is run byNuclear Fuel Services Inc. The department said that facility canmeet all naval fuel production needs and is the only manufacturingsite qualified to make all types of fuel for the Navy.   Derrick said available evidence did not seem to support theeconomic explanation, since the Erwin facility is 34 years old andhas suffered operational problems, whereas the South Carolinafacility is new.   Derrick gave no details of the operational problems at the Erwinfacility except to say it has ``had problems keeping track ofuranium inventories, among other difficulties.''   Henson Moore, the deputy energy secretary, told The AssociatedPress he was not able to comment immediately because he had not beenfully briefed on the situation. He added he was not aware of anyoperational problems at the South Carolina site.   Moore said Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C., had also objected to theshutdown decision.   In a telephone interview, Derrick offered no evidence ofoperational problems at the Savannah River facility, saying, ``It'smy own speculation.'' He noted the Energy Department as a matter ofpolicy has declined to publicly discuss the naval fuel facility'soperational record and its specific functions.   Some environmental groups also have questioned the shutdowndecision. Dan Reicher, a lawyer with the Natural Resources DefenseCouncil, said after last week's Energy Department announcement thathe found it ``curious'' the older Erwin facility would be kept openinstead of the newer plant.   In a related matter, Watkins came under fire again Tuesday fromenvironmental groups for his decision to hire Victor Stello, aNuclear Regulatory Commission executive, to run the department'snuclear weapons program.   Four groups _ Greenpeace USA, the Ralph Nader-founded PublicCitizen, the Government Accountability Project and the EnvironmentalPolicy Institute-Friends of the Earth _ released copies of a reportthey termed an ``indictment'' of Stello's tenure at the NRC, whichregulates the civilian nuclear industry.   The report listed several previously documented incidents inwhich some critics of Stello have raised questions about hiscommitment to nuclear safety.   Senate committee hearings on the Stello nomination are expectedto start in October.</TEXT></DOC>
