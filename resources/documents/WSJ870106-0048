For instance, the president released his version yesterday. And this morning the country is waking up to read stories describing the budget in a torrent of numbers. But the budget ritual is the heart and soul of Washington, its reason for being. The Beltway should greet the new budget the way revelers greet the new year on Times Square.    They could hoist a dollar sign to the top of the Washington Monument. All the senators, representatives, staffs, bureaucrats, lobbyists, lawyers, the press corps and local merchants could gather around this public dollar sign to revel in another year of federal spending. Happy Fiscal Year!    We make this suggestion only because we don't for a minute believe all the hand-wringing displays and long faces the town's residents put on to greet the new budget. Lawton Chiles and Bill Gray, the new budget chairmen, appeared on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; Sunday looking like pallbearers. Come on, fellas, admit it; spending public money is fun.    The joy of spending is certainly what comes through from a reading of the table of figures accompanying this editorial. When John Kennedy was president, spending ran between 18% and 19% of GNP; now it's running over 23% annually. In fact, the table puts the federal budget in a more accurate perspective than the one the public is continually offered.    Most commentary on the budget basically tells people that it involves something dreadful called &quot;the deficit,&quot; that the president &quot;won't get everything he wants for defense,&quot; that &quot;there has to be some movement on revenues,&quot; and that &quot;domestic spending has been cut to the bone.&quot; While the commentators send up these smoke signals, the president and Congress proceed to fight it out for 11 months. We don't believe that the public's understanding of the proper role of the federal government is very well served by this annual exercise.    The accompanying table from OMB offers a snapshot of how the U.S. has chosen to allocate its wealth over the past 25 years. It indicates the choices the country's elected representatives have made for their constituents.    During the 12 years of two of this century's most popular presidents -- Dwight Eisenhower and JFK -- spending on defense was more than 9% of GNP. If Ronald Reagan and Caspar Weinberger proposed any such thing now, a chanting chorus would call them heartless maniacs.    The key period in the table's history is the mid-1970s. Nondefense spending was 13.4% of GNP in 1974. The following year it suddenly jumped to 16.1%. It is interesting to note that this increase occurred in a year when defense spending was at a relatively low level. Congress never backed off from its unusually high domestic spending level of more than 16% of GNP. As is clear, any increases in defense spending automatically push total spending to unprecedented levels.    Yes, the U.S. now has a budget deficit, and it is true that such a deficit can't increase indefinitely without causing economic damage. The key question now facing this country, however, isn't whether its deficit should be $200 billion, $108 billion or zero. The key question is whether the U.S. public accepts or rejects the government's current claim on its wealth.    The public should understand that when Lawton Chiles and Bill Gray say the president has to give on revenues, this has virtually nothing to do with the deficit. They are asking the public to ratify, finally and conclusively, the rising domestic spending levels Congress has legislated over the past 10 years, a process that every Reagan budget has attempted to reverse. They are asking the public to set in place a political philosophy that holds that public spending never declines; it rises steadily, and those rises are paid for one way or another out of government claims on private production.    We are at the same point with the budget that we were when Ronald Reagan arrived in Washington in 1981. Mr. Reagan has never concealed his intentions. He wants Washington's claim on the nation's production to fall, and he has succeeded in reorienting the capital's upward march on domestic outlays. Instead of being allowed to blather on for 11 months about the deficit, Lawton Chiles, Bill Gray and the rest of Congress should be challenged to define explicitly what it is they want.    ---           Federal Spending as a Percentage of GNP Fiscal Year          1960   1964   1968   1972   1976 Total Spending       18.2   18.8   20.9   20.1   21.9 Defense               9.5    8.7    9.6    6.9    5.3 Non-Defense           8.7   10.1   11.3   13.2   16.6 Fiscal Year          1980   1984   1985   1986 Total Spending       22.2   23.1   24.0   23.7 Defense               5.0    6.2    6.4    6.9 Non-Defense          17.1   16.9   17.6   16.8</TEXT></DOC>
