The company, which operates the world's largest oil field in acountry with the world's largest reserves, said Wednesday the findwas made in the Hawtah region in central Saudi Arabia about 120miles south of the capital Riyadh.   Saudi Aramco said preliminary tests indicated the well couldyield 8,000 barrels a day of light crude containing only 0.06percent sulphur.   Sadad, I. Husseini, Saudi Aramco's vice president for explorationand production, said the find ``confirms the potential forsubstantial discoveries ... in rock formations recently studied bySaudi Aramco and assessed to be highly prospective.''   Oil industry executives and company sources reported the strikeTuesday. But they said it was made in the nearby Khurais region andgave no details.   The find was made as part of a major exploration program launchedby Saudi Aramco in 1986 after the Saudi government expanded thecompany's exploration concession.   It was the first strike since Aramco was restructured in late1988 and the first in a promising area only recently identifed. Mostof the company's oil field is located in the east part of thecountry.   Saudi Aramco announced earlier this year that its proven reserveshave gone up from 169 billion to 252 billion barrels, and couldreach 315 billion barrels.   The company has discovered 52 oil fields and one commercial gasfield since it started exploration 55 years ago.   Under its current Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesquota, Saudi Arabia exports 4.524 million barrels a day, but in theoil boom years output peaked at more than 11 million barrels a day.</TEXT></DOC>
