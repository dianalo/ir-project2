(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Anti-smoking forces hailed a federal jury'sdecision Monday to hold a cigarette company partially responsiblefor the death of a smoker but analysts discounted any long-termimpact for the industry.   ``Mighty Casey has struck out,'' said Dr. Alan Blum, a teacherat the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who founded theanti-smoking group Doctors Oughta Care.   However, because the jury did not find the tobacco industryconspired to mislead the public about the dangers of smoking,analysts said the verdict could be considered a victory for the $35billion tobacco industry.   ``I think it's probably the second-best decision they could havehoped for,'' said analyst Lawrence Pidgeon of Goldman Sachs andamp; Co.in New York.   The decision in the case of Rose Cipollone, who died of lungcancer after 40 years of smoking, exonerated the Liggett GroupInc., Lorillard Inc. and Philip Morris Inc. of conspiracy.   The jury did find that Liggett failed to warn the public aboutthe dangers of smoking and violated its promise to consumers tomake a safe product, contributing to Mrs. Cipollone's illness.   The jury awarded $400,000 in damages to widower AntonioCipollone from Liggett, which faced separate charges because itmade the brand of cigarettes Mrs. Cipollone smoked before Congressrequired health warnings on cigarette packs in 1966. Liggett haspromised an appeal.   ``It's bittersweet for Cipollone's attorneys since they won butit wasn't necessarily on the charges they wanted or for they amountthey wanted,'' said Pidgeon.   The two companies that were exonerated have ``a bit of breathingroom,'' while ``obviously for Liggett it's quite serious,'' headded.   Financial markets were closed when the jury made its decisionbut Allan Kaplan, a Merrill Lynch tobacco analyst, said he expectsonly short-term damage to industry stocks.   ``It's a loss but not a major loss,'' Kaplan said. ``The onlyway this would be considered a negative is if the award made itexciting for other (law) firms to sue. I don't think thathappened.''   He said stocks might drop early Tuesday but would probablyrebound during the day.   Jefferies Group Inc., which specializes in stock trading whenthe exchanges are closed, did not handle any tobacco stocktransactions after the ruling although there were many calls forinformation, trading assistant Maureen O'Connor said.   ``We've had a lot of inquiries, but everybody's trying to assessthe news,'' Ms. O'Connor said. The only offer was a bid of $80 pershare with the buyer seeking to sell at $84 a share, she said.   The tobacco companies waged an expensive defense _ the cost hasbeen been put at $50 million by one industry analyst _ because theyfeared a loss in the case could open the way for many moreliability suits.   The verdict marks the first time a jury has found any degree ofliability but anti-smoking forces and tobacco industryrepresentatives indicted it was not the clear victory for whichboth sides were hoping.   Philip Morris attorney Peter Bleakley said he thought theverdict represented a compromise on the part of the jury. ``I thinkthey had a holdout,'' he speculated.   The jurors _ one smoker, two who quit and three who never smoked_ would not comment on the case.   Liggett attorney James Kearney said he was very pleased by theverdict and thought it would discourage further liability suits.   ``The jury specifically rejected any claims of damages,'' hesaid. ``The flood gates have been closed even firmer than they werebefore.''   Marc Z. Edell, the attorney for Cipollone, said he saw a partialvictory in the jury's conclusion that ``that the cigarettecompanies should have warned people as early as the 1940s about thehealth hazards of cigarette smoking.''   Richard Daynard, whose Tobacco Products Liability Project inBoston supports lawsuits against the industry, went further:   ``It's the first time tobacco companies have been heldaccountable for the death and diseases their products cause. It's atremendous victory. I've been waiting four years to say somethinglike that. I think it will be a tremendous encouragement toplaintiffs and plaintiffs' attorneys to say, `You can do it.'''   ``This could be the beginning of the end for tobaccocompanies,'' added John F. Banzhaf, a George Washington Unversitylaw professor who directs an anti-smoking group.   John J. Madigan Jr., director of government relations for theAmerican Cancer Society in Washington, called the verdict the``opening salvo in what will probably be a long battle.''   Rep. Henry A. Waxman, D-Calif., the chairman of a Housesubcommittee that has scheduled hearings for July on possiblefederal regulation of the sale and promotion of tobacco, said ``thejury's decision represents a signifcant and long overduebreakthrough.''   ``This crack in the tobacco industry's liability armor will haveimplications far beyond the specifics of this case,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
