Unfortunately, no machine is perfectly linear.There are systematic sextupole components in dipole fields from steelsaturation, remanent fields, persistent currents, eddy currents, andrandom sextupole components due to field errors. Of course, there arealso sextupoles placed around the ring on purpose to counteract the aboveand to modify chromaticity. Perturbation theory can be used away fromresonances. A set of distortion functions has been proposed for eachorder of the perturbation. These functions are closed, i.e., periodic.They are independent of the beam amplitude and are very similar to thebeta-functions and alpha-functions of the linear theory. Though the projectionsof the beam profile onto the transverse phase planes are the only thingthat can be examined, these distortion functions can give the exact projections.This report previews these distortion functions, the formulae for theircomputation, and how they can be used in computing the phase-space projectionsof the beam and the tuneshifts. All these formulae are derived from aHamiltonian theory. Some applications are also discussed. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
