Please let me firmly take issue with your characterization of our HHS employees as &quot;average people&quot; who &quot;will make no effort now or ever to improve the efficiency, attractiveness or humaneness of their insurance program.&quot;    I am glad you share the president's fundamental faith in private solutions to society's problems. However, simply bashing the bureaucrats is not fair argumentation. The HHS staff -- career and political appointees -- has made numerous improvements in our programs. The Medicare program has been quite innovative, especially in the Reagan years. The prospective-payment system has dramatically transformed the hospital industry, and our movement toward private health plans promises further major change for the better. Indeed, a central goal of my tenure as HCFA Administrator is to continue this pattern of innovation.    William L.
