Recently, representatives from Digital Equipment Corp.operations in eight European countries met to lay thegroundwork for a pan-European labor council for theirworkers. The meeting was subsidized by the EuropeanCommunity, which put up $27,000 to pay for transportation andthree days of lodging, food, translation services and use ofa hotel conference room for 30 delegates. The delegates plana second meeting in March, which the EC also is expected tofinance.</LP><TEXT>   Labor unionists say similar initiatives are under way atmany of Europe's biggest industrial companies, includingGroupe Michelin, Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, NorskHydro AS, Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co., Rhone-Poulenc S.A.,Cie. de Saint-Gobain, Bayer AG, Hoechst AG and UnileverGroup.   The subsidized meetings are an offshoot of the ECCommission's proposed &quot;social action program,&quot; which seeks toestablish common labor and social security rules throughoutthe 12-nation community. The program faces stiff oppositionfrom some EC governments. But as the Digital meeting shows,supporters of the social action program are finding ways toskirt political obstacles.   For 1991, the European Parliament voted a budget of fivemillion European currency units ($6.4 million) to helpemployees of multinational companies set up pan-Europeanlabor organizations. Spending would surge to 19 million ECUsunder the preliminary budget for 1992.   That isn't a lot of money, and so far it hasn't attractedmuch attention. But as they become aware of the EC's growinginvolvement in financing pan-European trade unionism,employers are starting to express indignation. &quot;If you lookat the EC budget, you'll find extraordinary things in ithaving to do with union activities,&quot; says ZygmuntTyskiewickz, secretary-general of Unice, a Europeanemployers' confederation. &quot;Too much of this is going on.&quot;   Moreover, the principle involved in the subsidies issue --the so-called &quot;social Europe&quot; agenda -- goes to the heart ofa central debate over EC political unity. While France andGermany generally support the proposition of greater ECinvolvement in social matters, Britain is strongly opposed.   That debate could come to a head at a summit of EC leadersnext month in Maastricht, the Netherlands, which is beingconvened to develop a treaty on political union. It's unclearwhether EC leaders will be able to gloss over theirdifferences enough to reach an agreement.   But whatever the outcome in Maastricht, it's clear thatthe EC is already exercising some power over social issuesand having an impact on the labor movement. The EC funding&quot;was the major impulse behind a whole series of initiatives,&quot;acknowledges Franco Bisegna, secretary-general of theEuropean Federation of Chemical and General Workers' Unions.The money is helping to pay the &quot;astronomical&quot; costs oftranslators' fees and of flying employee representatives tomeetings from all over Europe, he says.   Meetings such as the one held by representatives ofDigital's 33,000 European workers aim to establish aconsultative body for each company representing all of acompany's European employees. The goal is in line with adirective that the EC proposed last December on &quot;theinformation and consultation of employees.&quot; The directivehasn't been brought before the Council of Ministers.   The proposal would require multinational companies withinthe EC that have at least 1,000 employees to set up Europeanworks councils. Management would be obliged to inform itsworks councils and consult with them on the company'sfinancial situation, plans for layoffs or hiring andinvestment projects.   Such works councils -- although with less far-reachingpowers than they would get under the proposed directive --already exist at a few companies such as Societe National ElfAquitaine, Nestle S.A., BSN Corp., Cie. des Machines Bull andThomson S.A.'s Consumer Electronics Division. Most othermultinational corporations, however, prefer to continuedealing with workers on a country-by-country basis undernational rules.   The European Commission has been seeking to boostconsultation and communication with workers since 1980. Themuch-discussed Vredeling directive, named for former ECSocial Affairs Commissioner Hank Vredeling, contained manyprovisions similar to those in the proposal made by thecommission last December. After years of debate and struggle,EC governments never endorsed the Vredeling directive.   Unice, the European employers' group, calls thecommission's latest proposal impractical because it wouldimpose a single system on situations that vary widely fromcompany to company and from country to country. &quot;We objectstrongly to a prescriptive and highly rigid directive,&quot; saysUnice's Mr. Tyskiewickz. &quot;We want freedom of choice.&quot;   In the European Parliament, however, the powerfulSocialist and Christian Democratic factions strongly supportthe directive. Parliament officials say unions need ECfinancial support to prepare themselves should the directivecome into force.   The commission is playing a passive role in the subsidyprogram. Officials, weary of angering the British governmentand other opponents of its labor policies before theMaastricht summit, say the subsidies are more of anembarrassment than anything else. &quot;It wasn't our idea,&quot; saysa spokesman for Social Affairs Commissioner Vasso Papandreou.&quot;But since a budget line was established, it's thecommission's job to manage it.&quot;   Adds another commission official whose job has been toparcel out the 1991 allocation to labor groups: &quot;It's apoisoned gift. . . . How do you distribute this kind ofpolitical money? Each of them wants 80% of the goodies.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
