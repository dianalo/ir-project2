The two semiconductor firms have been alternatelyannouncing new MPUs or faster versions of current devices.andO;Motorola provided some information about its forthcoming 68040MPU, announced a 50MHz version of the 68030, and leaked data onthe new 32-bit 68332 microcontroller.andP;  The new 68030 model willsample May, 1989 for $650 and ship in volume 3rd qtr 1989.andP;  Intelintroduces its 80860 megaprocessor, will introduce its 80486 MPUat COMDEX, and is already sampling a $367 33MHz version of thefirm's 80386 processor along with a $497 33MHz 80387 mathcoprocessor.andP;  The 80486 is an enhanced 80386, and 80486-compatibleperipheral chips include a local-area network IC, a MicroChannelchip, and an IC for the Extended Industry Architecture Standard.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Motorola Inc.
