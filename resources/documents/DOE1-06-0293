To a good approximation, {lambda}equals {delta}r{sup2}andgt;, the change in mean-square nuclear charge radii. Allowance is madefor specific mass shifts. In most cases, screening ratios have been calculatedby means of the Hartree--Fock method. The change of the electronic chargedensity at the nucleus is evaluated by means of empirical data as muchas possible. Whenever feasible, {lambda}is determined from isotope shiftsmeasured in various electronic transitions as well as in different spectraof an element. Relative and absolute values of {lambda}are given. Allpapers on isotope shift published up to the end of August 1986 have beenconsidered as well as some preprints obtained thereafter. copyright 1987Academic Press, Inc.</TEXT></DOC>
