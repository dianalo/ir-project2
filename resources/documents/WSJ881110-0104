Barrett (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> PHILADELPHIA  </DATELINE><TEXT>   As if this city's courts didn't have enough problems.    Fifteen municipal judges have resigned, been removed or been convicted recently in connection with taking bribes and other scandals. Business and citizen groups loudly accuse the local bench of incompetence and demand tougher disciplinary measures.    Now the courts face a $50 million budget shortfall. And what are city officials doing about it? The natural thing: suing everybody in sight.    The city's judges sued the mayor, Wilson Goode. The mayor, in turn, sued the governor, Robert P. Casey, claiming the state should foot the bill. Recently, the city appealed the whole mess to the state Supreme Court.    Philadelphia Solicitor Seymour Kurland asked the high court to order the state to pay. But as an alternative, he said Philadelphia wanted the justices to order the financially strapped city to raise its own taxes to get the $50 million.    During the oral argument, several justices angrily called Philadelphia's request a public-relations stunt designed to shift blame for a tax hike from City Hall to the Supreme Court. The justices &quot;went berserk,&quot; says a lawyer who was present.    The high court itself helped initiate the confrontation. Last December, it ruled that under the Pennsylvania Constitution, funding responsibility for lower courts should be shifted from localities to the state. The problem was the Supreme Court didn't indicate when the state had to start paying the tab, and the General Assembly still hasn't taken any action.    But the city seized on the opportunity. The Philadelphia City Council immediately trimmed its court budget by $50 million, citing the Supreme Court's decision. When no one was moving to sign a check, the city's judges decided to sue.    Local lawyers concede that the Dickensian morass only confirms Philadelphia's reputation as a judicial disaster area. &quot;Unfortunately, at this point the whole system is perceived as a joke,&quot; says David H. Marion, a former chancellor of the Philadelphia Bar Association.    Meanwhile, the Supreme Court may not rule for months, and the city is threatening to lock up the courts. Says Mr. Kurland: &quot;There's no money left at the end of December. Period. We're out of business.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
