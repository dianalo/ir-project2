Discussing Bush's thinking on the condition he not be namedpublicly, the official also said that the presidential pay raiserecommendation could come in conjunction with an ethics bill to besent to Capitol Hill next week.   But this official also said that ``no final-decision memo'' hasyet reached Bush's desk for the president's consideration.   Last week, Bush said he would make ``very specific proposals''on pay increases for top federal officials, even though Congresstwo months ago rejected a proposal that would have given lawmakersa 50 percent pay raise.   That proposal, advanced by the Commission on Legislative,Executive and Judicial Salaries, would have included hikes forfederal judges and approximately 7,000 top executives.   The Bush administration official said Wednesday that, amongother options still under consideration at the White House, was aseries of pay hikes for certain categories of federal officialsrather than an across-the-board raise.   The Washington Post reported in its Wednesday editions that Bushwould propose a 25 per pay hike for the judges. Most federal judgesnow make $89,500 per year, the same salary as members of Congressand top federal officials.   An administration source said that Bush had not yet settled on afigure. But another official noted that a commission studyingfederal jobs had recommended a 25 percent pay raise, and that thatfigure was the one being focused on by the White House. Thecommission, headed by former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker,made its report public late last month.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, a formerfederal judge himself, said Wednesday that it was ``premature tospeculate on what is not yet a recommendation.''   Mitchell said ``no one had talked to him'' from theadministration about a pay raise for federal judges.   As for separating Congress from the pay raises, Mitchell said,``There appears to be a widespread feeling that de-linking salarieswould make it more difficult for members of Congress ever to getincreases in pay.''</TEXT></DOC>
