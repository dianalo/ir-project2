The president signed the measure just hours before theAgriculture Department issued a new crop forecast that saidproduction of the nation's No. 1 crop, corn, would be down morethan a third from last year.

The half-percentage point hike in the prime _ to 10 percent _pushed the lending rate to its highest level since the spring of1985. It was the third increase in the rate so far this year andthe second in a month.

Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, the chief of staff, said his troops``completed a maneuver based on the presumption that the war hadended and (Iraqi) forces are free.
