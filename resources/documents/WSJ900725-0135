Seib   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>07/25/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A14</SO><GV>EXECUTIVE (EXE)SUPREME COURT (SUP)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- He may have dodged the problem for now, buthe can't escape it: President Bush rules over a RepublicanParty with a hopelessly split personality on the mostcontentious social issues.   This Republican schism, which party leaders strugglemightily to keep below the surface, was brought into sharpfocus by the resignation of Supreme Court Justice WilliamBrennan. GOP social-issue conservatives immediatelyenvisioned a replacement who would tip the court's balanceagainst abortion; other Republicans just as quickly geared upa campaign for a nominee favoring abortion rights.</LP><TEXT>   The president's artful selection of New Hampshire JudgeDavid Souter, a judicial conservative with virtually norecord on the abortion issue, may have skirted the problemfor now. But that hardly ends the problem. In fact, theSouter choice only points out that the split personality islikely to become a dilemma for Mr. Bush time and again, if hehas to fill more high-court vacancies -- and certainly asRepublicans try to write a platform for his likelyre-election campaign in 1992.   &quot;If the party goes out on a social-issues jag,&quot; warns GOPconsultant Roger Stone, &quot;we'll split our coalition.&quot;   In a sense, this rift is an outgrowth of Republicansuccess. In the past two decades, the party has drawn inAmericans with disparate backgrounds who unite behind the GOPon economic and national-security matters. On one side ofthis Republican tent are social-issue conservatives, to whomsuch matters as abortion, flag burning and gun control are ofsearing importance. On the other side are what party prosoften call the &quot;yuppie&quot; Republicans -- suburban voters whoare conservative on economics but either disagree with thesocial conservatives or blanch at emphasizing such emotionalissues.   In a sense, the president is like the hero in a Westernmovie who is tied to two wild horses that the bad guys sendcharging off in different directions to tear him apart. Therecurring challenge for Mr. Bush is to keep his horsesheading in the same direction. The risk is that if taxincreases begin to blur the differences between Democrats andRepublicans on economic matters, some voters could drifttoward the Democratic camp over social issues.   Such splits emerge because the national Republicancoalition, building for years, now is &quot;at a pretty latestage&quot; in which internal contradictions emerge more clearly,says Republican theorist Kevin Phillips. &quot;Managing it wouldbe pretty tough if you had the best of all worlds.&quot;   The divisions are borne out by a recent Wall StreetJournal/NBC News poll. Respondents were asked a series ofquestions about abortion, flag burning, gun control,obscenity and the death penalty, and were classified based ontheir answers. The poll found that among Republicans, 28%could be classified as social liberals, 38% as socialmoderates and 34% as social conservatives.   Republican operatives recognize the splits but argue thatthey are inevitable in successful national movements. Theyare &quot;the growing pains of becoming a majority party,&quot;maintains Mary Matalin, the chief of staff at the RepublicanNational Committee.   And Mitchell Daniels, former political director of theReagan White House, contends that &quot;any coalition broad enoughto command recurring majorities is going to have to be broadenough to have contradictions within it.&quot; He adds: &quot;But Ithink the cleavages within the Republican party are far lessthan the Democrats managed to have and survive for so manydecades. The distance between these various shades ofRepublicans isn't the same as the distance between Dixiecratsand civil-rights workers.&quot;   Still, the matter is complicated by an internal debateabout which camp is more important to Republican nationalsuccess. Many Republican operatives -- including some ofPresident Bush's advisers -- argue that the &quot;yuppie&quot; elementis more important in the long run, because it tends torepresent a breed of new, younger, upwardly mobileRepublicans who could provide long-term support.   But others argue that such voters don't form the same kindof dependable core of support that social conservatives do.&quot;Even though I know the yuppie segment has been part of thecoalition, it hasn't been the base and the strength of thecoalition -- not in terms of hitting the street,&quot; arguesRobert Billings, legislative director of the AmericanConservative Union.   The solution to the split, many analysts say, is to try tokeep the focus on issues that unite Republicans, such aseconomic growth, the fight against crime and drugs, andnational defense. Notwithstanding the current flap over thepresident's recent reversal of his no-tax pledge, economicissues, in particular, represent the glue holding theRepublican coalition together, many party operatives argue.   Another way to handle the splits, some suggest, is toemphasize a philosophy of individual rights -- a philosophythat theoretically should appeal to social-issueconservatives because of their disdain for big government andalso to abortion-rights advocates because of their disdainfor intermingling politics and social issues. &quot;The basicphilosophy of the party is one of individual choice,&quot; saysAnn Stone, who has just formed a group called Republicans forChoice, a group of Republicans favoring abortion rights.   The White House clearly hopes that Judge Souter and hisvague record on abortion won't antagonize anyone. &quot;Theadvantage is that neither wing of the Republican Party hasany idea how he'll come down on any of the issues thedifferent wings care about,&quot; says Republican Gov. Judd Greggof New Hampshire. Yet abortion is such a highly emotionalmatter that it is difficult to finesse. And the issuepromises to rear its head time and again, particularlybecause Mr. Bush could easily make several more appointmentsto a Supreme Court whose two most-liberal members now are intheir 80s.   The recent focus on abortion already has produced anincreasing outspokenness by Republicans favoring abortionrights. &quot;There are many Republicans who are pro-choice,&quot;maintains Rep. Claudine Schneider, a Rhode Island Republicanwho is running for the U.S. Senate and who favors abortionrights. &quot;A lot of them feel disenfranchised. But we are there-- and we are speaking out. The party is not of one point ofview here.&quot; Indeed, the Journal/NBC poll indicates that 59%of Republicans don't favor making abortion illegal.   And Ms. Stone warns that the Republican Party must workout some compromise before it writes its party platform in1992 or be forced to jettison its official anti-abortionviews entirely. &quot;We will either work it out in language bothsides can live with or we will have it dropped,&quot; she says.&quot;How can the party continue to take this position? It reallytears at the core of the party, at the very fabric of theparty.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
