Disney has launched its first publicinvestment, agreeing in principle with a debt-laden holdingcompany to acquire an 82% stake in Child World Inc., thenation's second-largest toy retailer.   The proposed purchase by Trefoil Capital Investors LimitedPartnership will include a subsequent $14-a-share, or $28million, cash offer for the 18% of Child World now in publichands. But details of the private part of the deal remainclouded and the value of the entire transaction is uncertain.</LP><TEXT>   The proposed sale appears amid growing interest inresuscitating leveraged buyouts flattened by heavy debt.Trefoil, formed by the executives of Shamrock Holdings Inc.,a holding company controlled by Mr. Disney, a Californiainvestor and nephew of the late Walt Disney, is a $450million investment fund designed to take advantage of justsuch situations. The term white squire has been used todefine a friendly entity that aids another company withouttaking it over.   The partnership said it preliminarily agreed withCleveland-based CNC Holding Corp. to buy CNC's stake in ChildWorld through what the two companies described as a &quot;non-cashtransaction.&quot; A person familiar with details of the proposalsaid it is intended for Trefoil to issue CNC new securities,which CNC in turn would offer to holders of its debt andpreferred stock. But such securities would apparently coveronly part of CNC's debt.   If successful, the transaction may make available tocash-tight Child World the funds to build up its depletedstore inventories. For CNC, the sale is a chance to movesubstantial debt off the holding company's balance sheet.   Trefoil said the transaction is subject to completion of adefinitive agreement and receipt of fairness opinions frominvestment bankers. It said it expects to finish thedocumentation by next Sunday and to complete the acquisitionof CNC's stake within 60 days thereafter.   In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, ChildWorld shares closed at $13.75, down 25 cents.   Child World, a distant second to Toys `R' Us Inc., thedominant giant of the business, had net income in its latestfiscal year ended Feb. 3 of $5.8 million, or $2 a share, onrevenue of $830.3 million. For the usually-slow first quarterended May 5, Child World had a loss of $7.4 million, or 65cents a share, on revenue of $130.1 million-off slightly froma year earlier. The company, based in Avon, Mass., operates174 stores in 31 states east of the Rocky Mountains.   It appears that the retailer, which last year slashedoverall inventories by 8.1%, or by 14% on a per-store basis,to save cash, may have cut too close to the bone. ChildWorld, based in Avon, Mass., said the latest quarter resultsreflected a shortage of many sales items after the Christmasseason, although it said inventories were refreshed in April.   Child World's parent, CNC Holding, the product of a 1984leveraged buy-out, has been under increasing pressure to meetfinancial obligations. At Feb. 3, the company had a negativenet worth -- assets minus liabilities -- of $207.3 million.Starting in September, CNC's more than $170 million of seniorsubordinated notes, which have been accumulating interest andprinciple, will require cash interest payments. Other partsof the company's approximately $500 million in long-term debtand preferred stock also begin in future years to requirecash payments.   CNC said this past March that it was exploringalternatives, including the possible sale or refinancing ofits stake in Child World. CNC also operates chains of opticaldepartments and stores, specialty shops, and key-makinginstallations.   Stanley P. Gold, president of Trefoil and president andchief executive officer of its general partner, Shamrock saidin an interview that Trefoil's capital will greatly helpChild World. &quot;This company has struggled in the last fewyears because it has been capital-starved,&quot; Mr. Gold said. Hesaid Shamrock's experience with its 71-store Music Plus and140-store Sound Warehouse music and video outlets givesTrefoil's partners considerable retail expertise.   Trefoil plans to retain Child World's current management,Mr. Gold said. However, as with past practice at Shamrock,Trefoil is likely to monitor developments at Child Worldclosely.   If the transaction proceeds, it appears that Trefoil willacquire Child World for only $28 million in immediate cashpayments -- the amount needed to buy the 18% of the stock inpublic hands. Thereafter, the profitability of the purchasewill depend on the terms Trefoil and CNC have set for thesecurities Trefoil will exchange with CNC for the Child Worldstock.   If the terms of these securities are too rich, it will cutinto Trefoil's returns. If they are too lean, observers said,then persuading holders of CNC's current high-yield &quot;junk&quot;financing to make an exchange may be difficult.   ---   William M.
