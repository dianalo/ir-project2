The UTA flight with 171 people aboard blew apart Tuesday over theWest African country of Niger, leaving no survivors.   The Lebanese extremist group Islamic Jihad claimed responsibilityin separate telephone calls in London and Paris, although officialssaid they could not authenticate the claim.   French officials say they have not ruled out an accidental causefor the explosion but that a bomb was the most likely explanation.   A spokesman for President Francois Mitterrand, speaking oncondition of anonymity in keeping with government practice, said athorough check had shown ``none of our services, none of ourministries, received either threats or intelligence aboutpreparations for anti-French attacks.''   Foreign Ministry officials said the statement was a reponse to anarticle in today's edition of the weekly L'Express, which saidFrance's Embassy in Beirut had reported urgently on an article inthe Lebanese weekly Ash-Shiraa reporting on possible terroristattacks.   L'Express said Ash-Shiraa reported the people who had held Frenchhostages in Beirut last year were complaining that the Frenchgovernment had not kept promises allegedly made to win their release.   France has repeatedly denied making any deal for the hostages,beyond agreeing to restore diplomatic relations with Iran. TheFrench dispute recurrent reports that they agreed to free AnisNaccache, a pro-Iranian Lebanese serving a life sentence for theattempted murder in 1980 of former Iranian Prime Minister ShahpourBakhtiar in France.   A Foreign Ministry official, who demanded anonymity, confirmedthat the French Embassy in Beirut sent copies of the Ash-Shiraaarticle to Paris.   ``All our embassies send us such reports regularly,'' he said.``The content of the article is extremely vague. You couldn't drawthe conclusion from it that there would be an attack on a UTA planeen route from N'Djamena to Paris.''   Ash-Shiraa is known for breaking the story of arms deals betweenthe United States and Iran, but since then many of its articlesrelating to Western hostages held in Iran have not proved correct.   French officials have said they will wait for the results of aninquiry before concluding whether the plane was bombed.   UTA, or Union des Transports Aeriens, said it received ananonymous telephone call about midnight Tuesday, before the downedaircraft had been located by a French military plane, saying IslamicJihad was responsible.   An anonymous caller to a Western news agency in London also saidIslamic Jihad was responsible and demanded the release of ShiiteMoslem religious leader Sheik Abdul-Karim Obeid, who was kidnappedfrom southern Lebanon on July 28 by Israeli forces.   Islamic Jihad is among several radical fundamentalist groups inLebanon believed to be part of Hezbollah, or Party of God, theumbrella group thought to hold 16 Westerners hostage in Lebanon.Obeid is a member of Hezbollah.   The hostages include eight Americans. The longest held is TerryA. Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985.   In N'Djamena, the Chadian capital where French authorities aredirecting the search effort, Col. Jean-Pierre Job told reporterstoday that flight and voice recorders had been found and were beingsent back to Paris for study.   Job said the searchers had recovered about 60 bodies to be flownout by helicopter. They are to be flown to France foridentification, the Foreign Ministry said. In Niamey, the capital ofNiger, a plane carrying coffins arrived this morning.   French paratroopers and military doctors were working undersevere conditions, with temperatures up to 113 degrees, andofficials said they expected it to be difficult to identify all ofthe bodies.</TEXT></DOC>
