The Open Software Foundation was created in May with the backingof Digital Equipment Corp., Hewlett-Packard Co., Apollo ComputerInc., International Business Machines Corp. and other majorcomputer companies.   The intention of the consortium is to develop a version of theUnix operating system that is independent of control by AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co., the creator of Unix. The standard couldrun on a variety of different computers.   The consortium, temporarily located in Lawrence, said it choseCambridge after a three-month search of sites across the country,including Washington; Pittsburgh; Austin, Texas; and California'sSilicon Valley.   Henry Crouse, president of the Open Software Foundation, saidthe presence of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology andHarvard University were factors in the choice.   ``It is situated in one of the country's premier high technologyand business regions, allowing us to attract top talent. It isclose to MIT, Harvard and other academic institutions pioneeringthe development of advanced systems technology.   ``Finally, it offers unique proximity to an internationalairport, with central and timely access to both the West Coast andEurope,'' Crouse said in a prepared statement.   The Open Software Foundation has 75 employees but expects togrow to 200 by year's end and 250 in 1989, according to spokeswomanPaula Slotkin.   OSF, a non-profit organization, was founded as a move againstthe control by ATandamp;T of the UNIX software standard. The originalmembers of the consortium, besides Digital, Apollo, Hewlett-Packardand IBM, included three European companies, West Germany's NixdorfComputer and Siemens AG and France's Groupe Bull.   Since then, they have been joined by Phillips of theNetherlands, Adobe Systems, Altos Computer Systems, Mitre Corp.,Stratus Computer, Italy's Tecsiel SpA, and Toshiba America Inc.   Alex Morrow, director of strategic relations for the consortium,said it plans to introduce its key product, a new open softwareoperating system, in January 1990.   In addition, he said, the consortium will undertake softwareresearch, development and technical support services, and it willestablish a laboratory with computer hardware from many companiesfor use in developing software that will work in differentcomputers.</TEXT></DOC>
