But conceptual efforts can never compete with thedevelopment of tangible tools to enhance innovation. The mostcreative and innovative organizations in the world -- suchcompanies as 3M, Xerox, Sony and Black andamp; Decker --increasingly rely on &quot;prolific prototyping&quot; to manage productdevelopment.   By quickly and relentlessly converting new product ideasinto crude mock-ups and working models, these organizationsare turning the traditional innovation cycle inside out.Instead of using the innovation process to come up withfinished prototypes, the prototypes are now being used todrive the innovation process.</LP><TEXT>   This represents a fundamental transformation of howinnovation gets done. For example, by sculpting blocks ofinsulation foam with a hot wire, a team of marketers andengineers from Bosch -- the German electronics giant -- wereforced to rethink the character, as well as function, of ahigh-tech helmet for construction workers. At the same time,this foam carving broke the barrier that preventscross-functional collaboration. Without the prototype, themarketers and the engineers had no common design vocabulary.   &quot;Prototyping becomes the common language between us andour clients,&quot; says Michael Barry, an industrial designer atGVO, a Palo Alto-based industrial design firm that oftengenerates as many as 40 prototypes over the course of a newproduct design. &quot;It becomes the bridge for us to walkacross,&quot; Mr. Barry adds.   &quot;Successful products need to integrate at a very earlystage,&quot; observes Carnegie-Mellon University Prof. Dan Droz,who worked with Bosch and is exploring the role of prototypesin new product development. Instead of simply swapping designand technical specifications between the marketing,engineering and manufacturing departments, Mr. Droz insiststhat companies should &quot;get physical fast&quot; -- that is, carveor construct tangible, palpable prototypes as soon aspossible. The prototype becomes a cheap way to manage risk.If the group doesn't like one, throw it away.   Inexpensive prototypes become building blocks for adults;serious toys for innovation. &quot;Too many organizations believethat manageability means predictability,&quot; says Mr. Droz. &quot;Theidea that you can `play' your way to a new product isanathema to managers,&quot; educated to believe thatpredictability and control are essential to new productdevelopment.   As if injecting a sense of play isn't subversive enough,prototype-driven innovation also promotes a radicaldeconstruction of the existing organizational charts. Itbecomes increasingly important to avoid turf wars, whichyield wounded prototypes. At high-tech companies, forexample, the engineers and technicians traditionally &quot;owned&quot;the prototype and bickered with marketing and manufacturingover suggested modifications. At packaged-goods companies,the brand manager typically owned the prototype.   To succeed today, the prototype can't be seen as theproperty of the engineers, the designers or the marketers --it has to be &quot;community property.&quot; And the most importantmember of that community has got to be the customer. Thecustomer must have the opportunity to play with and relate tothe prototypes as they evolve. Companies should invitecustomers in at the earliest phases of prototype design tosolicit their ideas. Even children can collaborate onprototypes; Sony's popular line of consumer electronics forkids, &quot;My First Sony,&quot; was a byproduct of extensiveinteraction (not market research) between Sony's industrialdesigners and their young clientele.   &quot;The issue isn't just the product,&quot; says Carnegie-Mellon'sMr. Droz, &quot;But the relationship between the product and theuser.&quot; Simply seeing how customers choose and play with amodel or emotionally react to a demonstration of technicalfeasibility can be valuable.   However, one common prototype pitfall can best beillustrated by the saying, &quot;Never show fools unfinishedwork.&quot; Some managers -- and customers -- are incapable ofvisualizing the ultimate evolution of a prototype. What toshow and when to show it can be the most critical decision anew product group can make. A classic example is 3M's Post-ItNotes: Initially, customers hadn't a clue how the firstsamples of this tacky paper could be used. Eventually, peoplediscovered a wide variety of uses -- and 3M crafted newPost-It products accordingly.   Similarly, people have to be exceptionally careful aboutthe dual nature of prototypes: Sometimes a prototype ispresented as a design platform to elicit feedback; at othertimes, it is a sales tool designed to elicit additionalfunding. Indeed, just as some companies keep two sets ofbooks, some organizations keep two sets of prototypes -- onefor show; the other for work.   But as GVO's Mr. Barry notes, &quot;prototypes are culturalartifacts&quot; -- they symbolize the culture of a corporation assurely as its memos. Creative, prolific organizations like 3Mand Sony tend to have lots of creative prototypes. Companiesthat have rigid review structures tend to have fewer, moreelaborate and more expensive prototypes. The quantity andquality of prototypes says a lot about an organization bothinternally to its workers and to its customers. Indeed, overtime, sophisticated customers may insist that they becomepart of a supplier's prototype design cycle. At a very lowcost, customer and company can collaborate to ensure that theproduct addresses the fundamental issues of value and price.   Organizations concerned with quality and speed-to-marketissues have no choice anymore but to view the rapiddevelopment of prototypes as a rigorous form of new product&quot;dress rehearsal.&quot; The companies that can fine-tune theirprototypes before &quot;opening night&quot; are the ones that willenjoy the hits.   ---   Mr. Schrage writes the innovation column for the LosAngeles Times.</TEXT></DOC>
