The Fort Worth, Texas-based electronics manufacturer, whichmarkets its products through its Radio Shack stores, also announcedThursday it will introduce a fast new personal computer thatfollows the design of International Business Machines Corp.'syear-old Personal System-2.   Tandy said the compact disk, known as the Thor CD, would beavailable for music in 1{ to two years and for data about a yearafter that, once recording and playback devices are built. The ThorCD could also be played _ although not recorded on _ in standardcompact disk players, Tandy said.   ``We're always concerned about technologies that threaten toenable consumers to infringe on copyrights,'' said Trish Heimers,spokeswoman for the Recording Industry Association of America.   The association has fought digital audio tape, or DAT,technology that would allow people to make high-quality recordingsat home.   Tandy said it would not only manufacture Thor CD equipment, butwould also license other companies to make it.   Some day the invention might yield the company ``hundreds ofmillions of dollars'' a year in profits from sales and royalties,John Roach, Tandy's chairman and chief executive, said at a NewYork news conference.   The Verbatim division of Eastman Kodak has said it willintroduce read-write compact disk technology, and several Japanesecompanies are known to be working on similar products, The New YorkTimes reported today.   The Times said some industry analysts were skeptical aboutTandy's invention, in part because Tandy didn't show workinghardware at the introduction.   ``This is by no means a perfected technology,'' said TimBajarin, an analyst with Creative Strategies in Santa Clara, Calif.   Tandy said it will be selling its Tandy 5000 MC in volume byJuly, a few months before Dell Computer Corp. of Austin, Texas, theonly other company that has announced a PS-2 ``clone.''   Tandy officials said their new computer was covered by a patentcross-licensing agreement with IBM, although certain PS-2 patentsthat may be issued to IBM in the future are still subject tonegotiations.   Tandy stock rose $2.62{ a share to $45.75 Thursday on the NewYork Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
