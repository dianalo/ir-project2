WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CINCINNATI (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Democrat Michael Dukakis gave credit Tuesdayto President Reagan for making progress with the Soviet Union andasserted that he and Reagan are closer together on U.S.-Sovietissues than the president and George Bush are.   ``It's an administration that's growing,'' Dukakis said.``Frankly, they're coming a lot closer to where I am.''   Dukakis, the Democratic presidential nominee, offered qualifiedpraise for Reagan's conduct of relations with the Soviets,including nuclear arms talks. But he drew a distinction betweenReagan's foreign-policy positions and those of Vice President Bush,who next week will become the Republican presidential nominee.   He said Bush _ who a day earlier called Dukakis a ``stealthcandidate'' who avoids tough issues _ had been unclear himself onmany foreign policy questions.   ``I don't think Bush's positions are clear on much ofanything,'' Dukakis said.   ``I don't know. Do you know where he stands?'' Dukakis said toreporters. ``I don't think anybody knows where he is on thesethings.''   Dukakis made his remarks to reporters aboard his campaign jet ona flight from Boston to Cincinnati, where he joined his fellowgovernors for the final day of the National Governors' Associationmeeting.   Dukakis spoke only briefly during discussions at the governorsconference, and later met in private with Democratic governors todiscuss the fall campaign.   He also visited a housing redevelopment project in Cincinnati topraise a resolution, passed unanimously by the governors, callingfor the federal government to help states and cities expand thesupply of affordable housing through housing grants and taxmeasures. The resolution calls for a $2.8 billion increase infederal spending for housing through a variety of programs thatwould provide rent subsidies and address what Dukakis called ``theproblem of home ownership for young families.''   ``Washington must be a part of the solution, and that's reallywhat the governors have said today,'' Dukakis said.   Dukakis, on the flight to Cincinnati, was asked about a remarkhe made last week in California that it appeared ``peace isbreaking out'' in various parts of the world. He was asked whetherhe gave credit to Reagan.   He called ``terrific'' recent cease-fire agreements in theregional conflict in Angola and in the Iran-Iraq war, and gavecredit to Reagan for progress with the Soviets.   ``The interesting thing is the president and I are closertogether on U.S.-Soviet relations than he is with Bush,'' Dukakissaid.   ``The INF treaty (eliminating medium-range nuclear missiles fromEurope) and Reagan's approach to the summit demonstrate awillingness on his part to explore closer relations with the SovietUnion,'' Dukakis said. ``It's to his credit.''   Dukakis also referred reporters to an interview published inTuesday's editions of the Boston Globe. In it he said, ``Thepresident has spent two terms in office, has grown, his views havechanged. I applaud him for it. I think one of the interestingquestions that the vice president and I will be debating will behow it is that the president and I seem to be closer on this issuethan he and the president.''   On the plane, Dukakis cited Reagan's description of the SovietUnion as an ``evil empire'' during his first term and credited himwith moving away from that belief.   ``Here's an administration that five years ago was talking evilempire and now the president is walking arm in arm with Gorbachevin Red Square,'' he said.   Dukakis had critical words, however, for the administration'spolicies in Central America, where Dukakis opposes support for theNicaraguan Contra rebels opposing that country's Sandinistagovernment. He said that was one issue on which Bush's position wasclear and was ``on the wrong side.''   He called Central American ``the one regional conflict wherewe're missing an opportunity to work with people who want to workwith us.''</TEXT></DOC>
