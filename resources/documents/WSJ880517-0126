Mikhail Gorbachev signed the treaty in December as general secretary of the Soviet Communist Party, but because he holds no official government office he doesn't have the authority to bind the Soviet state under international law. Leonid Brezhnev had a similar problem when he signed SALT I in 1972, but the Supreme Soviet voted to give him express authority that apparently hasn't yet been given to Mr. Gorbachev. This sounds to us like one for the World Court. </TEXT></DOC>
