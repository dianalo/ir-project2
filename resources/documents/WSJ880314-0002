Jesse Jackson, flush with Saturday's victory in South Carolina, is back home in Illinois and aiming at his biggest prize yet: his first victory in a northern industrial state.    Homestate rival Sen. Paul Simon still harbors hopes of winning the most convention delegates in tomorrow's primary here. But Mr. Simon saw his nomination prospects evaporate when his cash-poor campaign skipped Super Tuesday last week.    Mr. Jackson is a formidable force in the state where he finished third four years ago. The difference this time: He's won the united support of blacks and is attracting some whites to his standard. Sen. Simon's support in the parallel Illinois &quot;beauty contest&quot; -- a non-binding balloting for presidential candidates -- has eroded so much that Mr. Jackson has overtaken him in the Peter Hart Research Associates poll published in this morning's Chicago Tribune, with Gov. Michael Dukakis positioned to make a strong challenge. On the Republican side, polls show Vice President George Bush with a huge lead over Sen. Robert Dole, while Pat Robertson isn't a factor here.    As the campaign here entered its final hours, Mr. Simon was arguing that the crowded Democratic field ensures a brokered convention and urged Illinois voters to give him the cards to be a player in Atlanta. His delegate slates are studded with locally prominent names; in one lakefront Chicago district, for example, his slate includes four state senators. (The two other Democratic contenders, Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee and Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri, are expected to be also-rans here.)    Among the homestate candidates, Mr. Jackson seems to have the offensive. &quot;He's changed,&quot; says Richard Barnett, a black activist on the West Side of Chicago for the past three decades. &quot;He's more presidential. You don't hear as much hollering and shouting -- and you see him winning places like Alaska, where no one can argue he did it on the black vote alone.&quot;    Mr. Jackson is unlikely to win any delegates outside the three predominantly black congressional districts in Chicago. Even if Mr. Dukakis doesn't finish first, the Massachusetts governor could fatten his delegate lead with strong showings in other regions of the state.    Mr. Dukakis has sought to lure voters from Mr. Simon by airing a television spot holding out the specter that political bosses may take the choice of the Democratic nominee away from the public. William Daley, a member of the permanent Democratic establishment and son of the late powerful Chicago mayor, says the Dukakis argument &quot;is not a message of strength,&quot; and Mr. Simon himself is arguing that the bosses picked some good presidents, among them Franklin Roosevelt.    For his part, Mr. Dukakis is stressing his heritage as a son of Greek immigrants and has sought, with some success, to transform the primary here into a statewide ethnic festival. The other night, for example, he stood amid cheering voters in the Greek Islands Restaurant here, gave an interview to a Spanish-language television station and then turned to a reporter and said, in French, that his favorite teacher at Brookline High School was his French instructor, Mademoiselle O'Brien. </TEXT></DOC>
