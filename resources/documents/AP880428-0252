The bill, which President Reagan repeatedly has threatened toveto, toughens U.S. retaliatory measures against countries engagedin unfair trade practices.   It also would impose trade sanctions against Japan's ToshibaCorp. for its subsidiary's sale of sensitive equipment to theSoviet Union. The sales violated rules of the CoordinatingCommittee for Export Control, a Paris-based group that regulatesWestern high-technology exports to communist nations.   Hajime Tamura, minister of international trade and industry,said the Toshiba sanctions were regrettable because COCOMregulations provide that each member country has responsibility forensuring compliance by companies within its borders.   The Senate approved the bill and sent it to Reagan by a vote of63-36, less than the two-thirds majority needed to override a veto.The president's key objection is to a provision requiring employersto give advance notice of plant closings and major layoffs.   ``It is extremely regrettable that...the U.S. Senate, followingthe House of Representatives, passed the Omnibus Trade Bill whichcontains provisions problematical for Japan,'' Obuchi stated. ``Thegovernment of Japan strongly hopes that such a bill will notfinally be enacted.''   On Wednesday, Japanese Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita alsowarned that the bill could damage the global economy, and saidJapan would try to restrain growing protectionism in the UnitedStates by improving its ties with Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
