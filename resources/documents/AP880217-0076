Shultz'sforthcoming Middle East tour will fail to advance Arab-Israelipeace efforts because of Washington's ``flirtation'' with Israel, aleading columnist said today.   Moussa Sabry also blamed ``American influence and Zionist(Israeli) terrorism'' for wrecking a plan by the PalestineLiberation Organization to send a ship on a protest voyage fromNicosia to Israel this week.   Shultz is to make the regional tour late this month to discuss areported U.S. peace plan.   The blueprint, according to reports from Washington andJerusalem, calls for an international forum to launch Arab-Israelitalks in April on interim Palestinian self-rule in theIsraeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza. Negotiations on a finalsettlement for the two territories would open in December.   The plan was reported to have been outlined in a recent areatour by Assistant Secretary of State Richard Murphy.   ``I am not convinced that the U.S. administration under RonaldReagan will move effectively as a partner in the peace process,''Sabry wrote. ``It's all very well to make tours of capitals in thearea. It's all very well for Murphy or Shultz to come to theregion. But these trips will bring no results.''   Sabry, one of a group of Egyptian journalists known to be closeto President Hosni Mubarak, was writing in his periodic column onthe front page of the state-owned newspaper Al-Akhbar. He often iscritical of Israel, but his comments about the United States wereharsher than usual.   Citing next November's U.S. presidential election, he wrote:``This is the year when Democratic and Republican candidates viefor the Jewish vote. This is when the flirtation with Israel heatsup. I even venture the belief that the object of the U.S.administration's flirtation is (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak)Shamir, the leader of extremism.''   Sabry appeared to imply that Washington prefers Shamir to hismoderate coalition cabinet partner, Foreign Minister Shimon Peres,whose Labor Party favors territorial concessions to the Arabs.   On the PLO ship, Sabry said, ``American influence and Zionistterrorism that tried to destroy the vessel'' were the reason whythe planned protest voyage to Israel has been stalled.   The PLO charged that Israeli agents planted a mine that blew ahole and crippled the Cypriot ferry Sol Phryne on Monday as it wasbeing readied to carry Palestinian deportees, internationalobservers and reporters to Israel.   Israel vowed to prevent the ship from entering its waters.</TEXT></DOC>
