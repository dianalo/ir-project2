KALISH</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The dollar declined broadly in slow tradingFriday amid concerns over the U.S. economy and enthusiasm overpossible weekend tensions in the Middle East.   Gold prices fell.   With New York currency markets closed on Veterans Day, tradersstocked up on the U.S. currency in advance of a possible PersianGulf escalation during the three-day weekend.   The dollar is generally viewed as a relatively safe investmentin times of strife. In addition, possible oil shortages resultingfrom a Persian Gulf strife could hurt Japan's oil-dependent economyand help diminish the yen's value against the dollar, traders said.   But before the day's end, currency trading in New York slowed toa virtual crawl, as investors eyeing the Middle East already hadcovered their short-dollar positions.   Analysts said a bigger influence was an earlier Labor Departmentreport that showed the nation's ``core'' inflation rate - theproducer price index minus food and energy costs - remainedunchanged from September.   Investors sold on this sign of moderating inflation, seeing itas one more reason for the Federal Reserve to ease interest ratesto stimulate economic growth. Lower interest rates can have achilling effect on the value of the dollar.   ``You're starting to build up a fairly reasonable case for atleast a quarter of a percent cut,'' said Robert Hatcher, acorporate dealer at Barclays Bank PLC.   In New York, the dollar dipped to 129.70 yen from 130.35 yen onThursday.   Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose 1.00 yen to a closing 130.50yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at a lower rate of 129.75 yen.   In New York, one British pound cost $1.9655, more expensive thanThursday's $1.9625.
