Partisanship over a &quot;worthy&quot; policy that &quot;did not work,&quot; in which &quot;serious mistakes were made,&quot; must not be allowed to weaken us, he said. In any case, &quot;we will not sit idly by if our interests or our friends in the Middle East are threatened, nor will we yield to terrorist blackmail.&quot;    In his own words, Mr. Reagan once more revealed that he either doesn't understand the full consequences of his fatally flawed exercise in Realpolitik or else believes the public can be faked into believing nothing of real importance has happened. It's not a palatable set of alternatives.    To understand just how badly the policy went wrong and how grave have been its results, consider first what was involved. The weapons we provided to Iran were not &quot;peanuts,&quot; Secretary of State George Shultz's testimony to Congress this week notwithstanding. There are military experts who believe they have helped tip the balance in the recent fighting between Iran and Iraq. But the significant weapons transfers have been made over several years by Israel -- and those were made with the consent and support of the president and his men. Other weapons were sold directly by such allies as Portugal.    None could have made it to Tehran without American knowledge. All went directly to sustain the Iranian war machine at a time when Washington's official, public policy was to prevent any nation or private supplier from making weapons available to that same machine. Given what is now known about the hidden reality of the past several years, who is suppose to take us seriously? The U.S. is demonstrably either hypocritical or impotent, or both. The ayatollah's men portray the president as a groveling petitioner, a paper tiger and a false friend, and they are bound to have a receptive audience.    That is the critical point. There has been one clear winner as a result of the president's &quot;serious mistakes,&quot; and it is Iran. There has been one clear loser, and it is the U.S. The second point is the one that even now the president cannot bring himself to make. It is not just that &quot;full responsibility&quot; for the fiasco is his. That almost literally should go without saying, since he is the president. What matters is that the &quot;serious mistakes&quot; were primarily his.    As a result of them, we are now deploying the Navy to the area to reassure our allies. It's too late. The revelations of our duplicitous dealings have strengthened Iran's political as well as military position. Rather than being the target of great power pressure, Iran is now seen as the beneficiary of great power largesse, with the Great Satan itself in the forefront of the gift givers. Each time the president or one of his spokesmen repeats anew the assertion that our long-term interests in the Mideast will be served by a closer relationship to Tehran, our client states along the Persian Gulf shiver. They no longer have to suspect that we will throw them, and Iraq, over the minute that Tehran gives the right signal. They know we have already done so.    There is a phrase much in favor among diplomacy buffs. We &quot;play the China card,&quot; or whatever, in relation to a competition with a third nation. In Tehran, the mullahs have been immeasurably strengthened in yet another way by the sure knowledge that they can always play the &quot;American card.&quot; That knowledge is aimed squarely at the Soviets. It's just as well it exists, but it adds considerably to the stability of the ayatollah's regime.    On yet another front, Iran emerges the clear winner. Because, as the president put it, we were willing to pay ransom &quot;to try to secure freedom for our citizens held in barbaric captivity,&quot; no one can officially admit the obvious, which is that the payment was a signal to hostage-takers that much could be gained by adding to their stock and little would be risked.    Because of the convoluted exercises necessary to distance the president from the rash of new seizures that have occurred in recent months, the fiction that Iran has no connection with them must be maintained. And since Iran is repeatedly absolved of responsibility, its agents need not fear that their patron will be harmed. That is the reality against which the president's pledge that &quot;we will not sit idly by&quot; nor &quot;yield to terrorist blackmail&quot; must be measured. We do and we have, and everyone in the Middle East knows it.    There is much to be done as &quot;we go forward together in the national interest,&quot; as the president would have us do. A new anti-terrorism policy must be manufactured from the rubble of the old one. A prolonged period of confidence-building lies ahead with Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, the Persian Gulf states and others. Iran must be constrained from using the muscles we have provided to pound the area into hegemonic conformity.    The president warned that &quot;in debating the past, we must not deny ourselves the successes of the future.&quot; But until there is full understanding of what the failures of the past have produced, there is no way to build anything approximating success in the future. Given the president's absolute refusal to participate in that exercise, it is up to Congress, on both sides of the aisle, to continue to work on the problem.    ---   Mr. Carter is a political commentator who heads a television production firm. </TEXT></DOC>
