Nearly all the 7,000 inhabitants in the Shek Kong DetentionCenter refused to have breakfast and lunch Saturday, said a policespokesman on condition of anonymity. She added boat people hungbanners in the camp saying, ``Do not repatriate us to Vietnam.''   A government spokesman said 4,100 boat people in detentioncenters in Shatin and on Lantao Island also stopped eating.   The actions came before meetings in Geneva Monday and Tuesdaythat will review plans to screen Vietnamese boat people andrepatriate those who do not qualify as refugees.   Under a policy adopted by Hong Kong and many Southeast Asiannations in June 1988, Vietnamese boat people will be grantedrefugee status and resettled overseas only if they can prove theyfled political persecution in Vietnam. Otherwise, they would beconsidered illegal immigrants and face repatriation.   The government spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity,said pamphlets had been found in some camps urging the boat peopleto hold rallies and hunger strikes against the screening policy.   He said there were no incidents of disorder and the hungerstrikers did not pose any security threat.   More than 56,000 boat people are in Hong Kong. Two-thirds ofthem are kept in the prison-like centers, waiting to be screened.   In August, Vietnamese battled each other with iron bars, stonesand sharpened objects at one detention center. Seventeen peoplewere injured.</TEXT></DOC>
