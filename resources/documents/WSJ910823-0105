By the endof those hours, some devoutly cherished illusions about theSoviet people and their president, Mikhail Gorbachev, werebreathing their last.   Via television, the press and other news outlets the KGBhad somehow neglected to suppress, the entire world has seenthe face of the Soviet public in a new and revealing way. Foras long as anyone can remember, Soviets have been portrayedas a people in one way or another crippled by years ofauthoritarian rule -- a people, as many a pundit hasconfidently informed us, confused by the notion of freedomand the burden of having to make choices. The Soviets, wehave long heard, may like the idea of democracy in theory butin fact are dubious about change. They are, the story goes,first and foremost interested in consumer goods, a betterstandard of living and the like. If the coup and its outcometell anything, it is that there is something profoundly wrongwith this picture.</LP><TEXT>   In Moscow, at the Russian Parliament, men hurledthemselves in front of tanks and built barricades, inprotection of their symbol of democracy. They did all this indefiance of the junta crew's offer of what Soviets aresupposed to have wanted above all -- the departure of Mr.Gorbachev, an end to the economic hardship that worsenedunder his reforms, a return to domestic stability, and theend of the breakup of the Soviet empire.   ABC's cameras showed us a young man throwing himself downin front of an oncoming tank, and being dragged up by someonein the crowd just as the tank was about to roll over him. Butthe television image that more than any other captured theshock citizens felt at the first sight of the tanks rumblingmenacingly toward the Parliament building and Boris Yeltsinwas of a young woman clutching her face in a paroxysm ofgrief. It is a picture that has a certain resonance -- onethat can take its place alongside the famous World War IInewsreel picture of the Belgian man watching, tears coursingdown his face, lips pressed together to hold back sobs, asthe invading German troops march past.   This time, in Moscow 1991, the tanks and those in themsoon had to give way to a citizenry that saw in those tanksand troops not invaders but betrayers. &quot;Fascists]&quot; an olderwoman shouted at the young men in the turrets.   When it was all over a day later, when tank crews andsoldiers loyal to Boris Yeltsin had made their presence feltand the 20,000 citizens who had put themselves squarely inthe sights of the junta's tanks had won, a woman demonstratortold a U.S. network reporter what it all meant. Her commentshould be instructive, particularly to those inclined toaccept the view that the Soviets are a people who have yet tolearn the value of freedom, a people concerned, now, mainlywith getting and spending, for whom democracy means the joysof a McDonald's hamburger.   The woman explained that, yes, before the coup attempt allshe had wanted was some way out of the shortages and theprivation and the standing in lines, and to be rid of MikhailGorbachev. Still, when the tanks came, and Mr. Gorbachev wasimprisoned and she saw the move back to the old totalitarianways, she concluded -- perhaps to her own surprise -- thatfreedom was more important to her than having more food orshoes.   To a Russian like emigre Vladimir Bukovsky, the woman'schoice comes as no surprise at all. Mr. Bukovsky, whosedissident politics earned him 12 years in Soviet camps andpsychiatric hospitals, notes that the Soviets are by naturenot an authoritarian-loving people. &quot;It's the Germans wholove order,&quot; he says. Now, after 74 years of ironcladrepression, Mr. Bukovsky adds, the Soviet people have donesomething to regain their pride and sense of self-respect,and this is &quot;the most vitally important effect of this wholeevent.&quot;   There are a good many other vitally important effects ofthe coup, whose unraveling was described, most memorably, byDan Rather. The anchor brought word that the coup leaderswere headed for the airport, and &quot;making their getaway likeThelma and Louise&quot; -- a comment that underscored a growingsense that these 60 hours that shook the world had been thework of the gang that couldn't shoot straight.   No one could understand -- unless one subscribed to thesuspicion that Mr. Gorbachev had been part of the plot -- whythe KGB had committed errors that made it certain the coupwould fail. Coups, after all, are the KGB's business.Commentators and pundits are still asking that question, withreason.   There are, however, some results of this affair aboutwhich there can be no doubt. One of these is the change inthe status of Mikhail Gorbachev, in whom Western leaders haveinvested so much. For some time now the leaders of theWestern world have had one notion of who the leader of theSoviets was, while the citizens of the Soviet Union have hadanother. No one watching the throngs rushing to barricade theRussian Parliament building, or Boris Yeltsin standing on thetanks -- or calmly sitting through a bunker interview withDiane Sawyer while surrounded by enemy artillery -- has anydoubt now about who the leader is.   ---   Ms. Rabinowitz is a Journal television critic andeditorial writer.</TEXT></DOC>
