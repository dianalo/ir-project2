Some 100 attorneys, representing 60 firms nationwide,filed a motion with a federal court panel in Washington,D.C., urging the appointment of one judge, either in SanFrancisco or Wichita, Kan., to hear the cases. The suitswould then be consolidated as &quot;multidistrict litigation,&quot; atleast for pretrial fact finding.</LP><TEXT>   The lawyers have ganged up against Cincinnati attorneyStanley Chesley, who on Feb. 14 convinced U.S. District JudgeCarl B. Rubin to approve a class action case in Cincinnati'sfederal court. Mr. Chesley argues in court papers that JudgeRubin should handle the litigation, either as a class actionor a consolidated multidistrict litigation.   Either way, the group of 100 lawyers has made it clear itstrue mission is to have the cases proceed anywhere butCincinnati, and before anyone other than Judge Rubin. Thelawyers, headed by Lawrence S. Charfoos of Detroit and MarthaK. Wivell of Robins, Kaplan, Miller andamp; Ciresi in Minneapolis,express serious mistrust of both the judge and Mr. Chesley.   A decision by the eight judges on the multidistrictlitigation federal panel in Washington, D.C., will go a longway toward shaping the direction of hundreds of federal casesover the safety of silicone-gel breast implants. If the panelapproves one judge as the multidistrict judge in charge ofall cases, that would stop all proceedings in existing classactions, said Ms. Wivell. The decision will not affect casesfiled in state courts.   In their unusually contentious motion to the federalJudicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation last week, thegroup said they &quot;strongly oppose&quot; Judge Rubin as &quot;aninappropriate judge.&quot;   They described his decision to approve a class action onthe implants as a &quot;hasty&quot; and &quot;unilateral action&quot; takenwithout receiving briefs &quot;and without making factualfindings.&quot; Judge Rubin did finally hear their arguments in aone-hour proceeding Friday, however. He is expected to decidewithin 10 days whether all women allegedly injured by breastimplants have to be part of the Cincinnati case or may optout.   Ms. Wivell was sharply critical of Mr. Chesley as well.She said he filed his classaction suit in January &quot;withoutany notice to other plaintiffs, despite the fact thatattorneys from his office sat in on a meeting of thebreast-implant litigation committee of the American TrialLawyers Association without saying anything about theirplans.&quot;   Mr. Chesley said he wouldn't respond other than to remarkthat his law-office colleagues at the recent ATLA meeting inFlorida &quot;disclosed what we were doing.&quot;   The group of 100 lawyers argued that the cases should betransferred either to U.S. District Judge Patrick F. Kelly inWichita, Kan., or U.S. District Judge Marilyn Hall Patel orChief U.S. District Judge Thelton E. Henderson in SanFrancisco.   The attorneys note that Wichita is centrally located andnot burdened with lots of criminal cases and that Judge Kelly&quot;has substantial experience in products litigation&quot; such asthe complex liability suits over tampons and toxic shocksyndrome, and asbestos-related illnesses.   The San Francisco judges presided over two breast-implantsuits that went to jury verdicts favoring plaintiffs. Thegroup of attorneys argues that since these judges alreadyhave handled complex discovery issues over implants, theyhave a head start in deciding on other related matters. Inthe attorneys' motion, they argue that Cincinnati and Ohiohave &quot;absolutely no nexus with the implant litigationwhatsoever.&quot;   The national legal counsel for manufacturer Dow CorningCorp., Frank Woodside, is based in Cincinnati. Mr. Woodsidesaid Dow Corning, a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. andCorning Inc., would like the legal proceedings to stay inCincinnati, since &quot;a lot of activities have taken place herealready.&quot;   ---   CHARITIES AREN'T INCLUDED in law against forced donations,court rules.   A 1972 Maryland law makes it a crime to intimidate someoneinto donating to social, economic or political groups. ButUnited Way of America and other charities don't fall intothose categories, Maryland's highest court ruled.   The question arose in a suit brought against United ParcelService Inc. by a former sorting supervisor. She alleged shewas fired in 1986 because she canceled her automatic payrollcontributions to the Alexandria, Va., charity.   The Maryland Court of Appeals, in a 5-2 decision, notedthat charities aren't specifically named among the categoriesin which coerced contributions are banned.   The court didn't address the issue of whether any coerciontook place in the woman's case. UPS stresses duringcontribution drives that donations are strictly voluntary,said Alan H. Kent, a Washington, D.C., lawyer who representedthe Greenwich, Conn., company.   In a dissent, Judges John C. Eldridge and Robert M. Bellwrote, &quot;The majority refuses to give the words of the statutetheir natural and usual meaning.&quot; The majority, they said,essentially decided that some coerced contributions are allright.   &quot;It does seem like a very odd decision,&quot; said Robert S.Peck, a legislative counsel in Washington, D.C., for theAmerican Civil Liberties Union. &quot;If coercion did occur, itdoesn't really matter very much what kind of group it is.&quot;   A lawyer for the woman, David M. Williams of Chestertown,Md., said he disagreed with the decision and that his clientmight pursue a wrongful-discharge suit against UPS.

Companies and their insurers in many states have beenarguing over the interpretation of &quot;pollution exclusion&quot;clauses in liability policies. Insurance companies argue thatthe clause protects them from paying for most pollutiondamage, while policy-holders claim that such damage iscovered because it was not intentional.   New Jersey law has been seen as favoring the policy-holderinterpretation. In at least five coverage disputes, NewJersey state appeals courts ordered insurers to provide atleast some coverage to policyholders facing pollution damageclaims. But the state's highest court had never ruled on theissue, leaving it unresolved.   The question ended up before a federal appeals court inVirginia in litigation between Triangle PWC Inc., a wire andcable manufacturer, and its insurers. The federal governmenthas claimed that Triangle might be responsible for a portionof the cost of cleaning up a landfill site where Triangle'sWest Virginia plant dumped waste.   The federal appeals court chose to apply New Jersey law tothe case but then interpreted it differently than appealscourts within the state. The ruling in favor of the insurersurprised lawyers familiar with the issue. The appealscourt's interpretation of the law won't bind state courts,but may influence some New Jersey judges.   &quot;The decision is certainly going to be disturbing to a lotof policy holders,&quot; said Mark F. Rosenberg, a lawyer with theNew York law firm Sullivan andamp; Cromwell who was not involved inthe case. Mr. Rosenberg, who heads an American BarAssociation subcommittee studying the language of pollutionexclusion clauses, said the appeals court decision might givepause to policy holders who had previously &quot;flocked to NewJersey courts&quot; seeking a favorable interpretation of theclause.   But, Stephen M. Orlofsky, a lawyer in the Cherry Hill,N.J., firm Blank, Rome, Comisky andamp; McCauley who representedTriangle, said the appeals court decision was an &quot;aberration&quot;and predicted that New Jersey courts would continue to favorthe policy-holder interpretation. Mr. Orlofksy, said hisclient, which is a subsidiary of ANC Holdings Inc., New York,may try to appeal the decision.

Rovner ruled that the BoyScouts of America can deny membership to agnostics andatheists.   Mark Welsh, nine years old, of Hinsdale, Ill., had beendenied membership to the Cub Scouts for refusing to profess abelief in God. He and his father, Elliott Welsh, sued the BoyScouts, arguing that the organization qualifies as a &quot;placeof entertainment&quot; under the terms of the Civil Rights Act of1964 and therefore cannot discriminate on the basis ofreligion.   Judge Rovner ruled that the Boy Scouts, lacking aconnection to a particular site or facility, does not qualifyas a &quot;place of entertainment&quot; or any other kind of &quot;place ofpublic accommodation&quot; under the terms of the federal statute.   Boy Scout leaders had testified at trial that admittingatheists would be divisive and undermine the organization'sefforts to teach religious duty and other values.   Boy Scouts of America spokesman Blake Lewis said thedecision was &quot;a reaffirmation of the BSA's right to determinethe qualifications of our members.&quot;   The Welsh family's lawyer said he hopes to appeal.   A similar case is pending in state court in Santa Ana,Calif.
