The release of the bacteria was tentatively approved by the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory authorities earlier this year and planned for this summer. The bacteria is a nitrogen-fixing microbe that has been genetically altered to increase alfalfa yields. The biotechnology concern plans to conduct the field tests in Peppin County, Wis.    The company said that in studies this summer it discovered that a test developed to monitor the released bacteria can't adequately distinguish between the altered strain and naturally occurring forms. &quot;Once we learned about the problem, it was pretty much a mutual decision&quot; between the company and regulators to delay the release of the bacteria, a BioTechnica spokesman said.    BioTechnica said it has developed an improved monitoring test that it plans to submit for EPA and other regulatory approval within a few weeks. The company added that it hopes to obtain final regulatory approval for the field test before &quot;the normal time for planting of alfalfa next spring.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
