(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Judy HousmanandM;This year, the personal-information manager (PIM) is like the company's mostvaluable employee -- everyone wants the label, but no one is quite sure whatthe criteria are.andM;Overlapping but differing definitions of PIMs abound, and the products thatlay claim to this title excel at different tasks.andM;Broadly defined, PIMs are packages that have flexibility in organizingdisparate scraps of information.andP;  Geographically speaking, they are locatedsomewhere at the intersection of word processing, database and projectmanagement.andM;''People are reclassifying their products to jump on a bandwagon.andP;  Productsthat have been around for a while without anyone paying attention aresuddenly becoming PIMs,'' said Jeffrey Tarter, editor and publisher of Soft-- Letter, a software-industry newsletter based in Cambridge, Mass.andM;''PIMs are not really like word processors or databases.andP;  WordPerfect and MSWord or R:base, dBASE and Paradox differ in style, but perform pretty muchthe same actions.andP;  There is no consistency in the case of PIMs,'' said MarkThurston, director of information systems at Oppenheimer, Wolff andamp; Donnelly, alaw firm based in Minneapolis.andM;Thurston offered one criterion for differentiating PIMs.andP;  ''There is acontinuum between totally structured and totally free-form data.andP;  Relationaldatabases are at one end of the continuum, and totally free-form productssuch as [ZyLab Corp.'s] ZyIndex are at the other.andP;  PIMs are in the middle,''he said.andM;According to Thurston, the two ends of the spectrum are becoming lessdistinct.andM;''There is a growing tendency for free-form, full-text products to providemore structure and structured databases to handle text,'' he said.andM;He noted that a developer or user may first have to decide whether to use astructured database or a PIM before they start choosing among PIMs.andM;''In a network situation in which several people are sharing centralizedinformation, data must be more structured,'' he said.andP;  ''When the informationis confined to an individual desktop, information can be more free-form.''andM;Tarter offered the following test: ''You can throw away the index to astructured database and easily reconstruct the index.andP;  If the index and allthe pointers crash in a PIM, there is no way to reconstruct or rebuild it.andO;The relationships rather than the pieces of information are at the heart ofthe [PIM] system,'' he said.andM;Bert Collins, director of the Boston Computer Society's database users' groupand a consultant based in Winchester, Mass., said, ''Personal-informationmanagers are different attempts to fill the gaps between existing softwarecategories.andP;  Each stakes out a different place in the continuum betweendatabases, word processors and project managers.''andM;Richard Kraus, director of product development for Persoft Inc., thedeveloper of IZE, which is located in Madison, Wis., agreed.andM;''A large number of PIMs, such as [Symantec Corp.'s] GrandView and [LotusDevelopment Corp.'s] Agenda, are new approaches to project management, withAgenda best suited to people who like to throw everything on the desk, andGrandView and its outlining capability best suited to people who like toorganize and break out the steps of a project.andM;''IZE, on the other hand, provides a way of organizing large amounts ofinformation that you want to work with, perhaps in ways you don't yet know,''Kraus said.andM;Soft -- Letter's Tarter explained, ''A class of first-generation PIMsaddressed some piece of the information-retrieval problem before the term''PIM'' was invented.andP;  ZyIndex addressed text retrieval, the early Ask Sam[Ask Sam Systems Inc.] and early Tornado Notes [Micrologic Corp.] allowed forthe entry and retrieval of free-form notes.andM;''The early DayFlo Tracker [Dayflo Software Corp.] addressed [client] contactmanagement.andP;  But these weren't broad solutions -- they lacked the ability tohandle complex relationships.andP;  The second generation includes the ability todefine complex relationships among pieces of information,'' Tarter said.andM;Tarter indicated that PIMs vary in flexibility and in the kinds ofinformation they can handle.andM;''Agenda is extremely programmable,'' he said.andP;  ''Nothing is predefined.andP;  Itdoesn't even have a calendar predefined.andP;  At the other extreme are productslike [Conductor Software Inc.'s] Act!, a product hard-wired to manage salestracking.andP;  There is a trade-off between flexibility and excelling at aparticular task.andP;  Agenda doesn't really deal with anything but text.andM;''[Valor Software Corp.'s] Info-XL, on the other hand, deals with a varietyof data types.andP;  It includes structured records, free-form notes and acalendar.andP;  It is at the center of the continuum with a medium amount ofprogrammability and hard-wiring,'' Tarter said.andM;Although Agenda handles dates, he added, ''a good information manager shouldhandle time better than Agenda does.''andM;David Eggleston, a consultant based in Arlington, Mass., agreed with Tarter'spositioning of the two products.andP;  Eggleston, who started as an Info-XL user,is now an Agenda developer.andM;''With Info-XL, I was able to get started and pour a fair amount ofinformation into the product in a short time.andP;  I was elated, but quicklyfrustrated.andP;  Info-XL forces you to clone by hand headings that belong inseveral places, while Agenda automatically shows items in multiple positions.andM;''I have an application with fairly complex relationships in mind.andP;  I waslooking for something which would not require learning programming to makeapplications available to others.andP;  With Agenda, I am making slow progresstowards implementing my idea,'' said Eggleston.andM;Other products that handle different types of personal information are morestructured than traditional databases, in that they do one thing and onething only.andM;Stephen Drake, vice president and financial consultant at Shearson LehmanHutton Inc. in Houston, and an Act! user also praises the structuredapproach.andM;''Act! was set up with what I needed -- name, address, phone number and 15customizable fields.andP;  I was functional in an hour and taught others in 15minutes.andP;  Agenda was too flexible.andP;  Act! was like paint-by-number, while withAgenda I would have to become an artist.''andM;Peter O'Donnell, director of marketing communication at Chronos Software Inc.andO;of San Francisco, the makers of Who-What-When, a simplifiedproject-management and time-tracking tool, said, ''If you have anunstructured database you have to keep the structure in your head --structures help you to be more organized.andP;  But we also believe in creating atool flexible enough to adapt to different work styles.''andM;However, said Persoft's Kraus, ''We may have focused too much on the conceptof personal information -- information which is of concern to one person.andO;There is also information which is personal -- information whose organizationreflects a particular person's style but might be used by others.''andM;----------Judy Housman, a microcomputer trainer and consultant based in Cambridge,Mass., specializes in project-management software.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
