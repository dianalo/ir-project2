The Rev. Marshall Gourley, pastor of Our Lady of GuadalupeChurch, collected six handguns, two rifles and nearly 400 pledgesSunday at his church in west Denver.   The weapons were turned over to Police Chief Ari Zavaras, andthe pledge cards to Mayor Federico Pena. Gourley has asked policeto destroy the weapons.   Gourley asked his parishioners to give up their guns after hepresided at the funerals of two people who died violently. One waskilled by police and the other killed himself.   After Sunday's services, Gourley said the problem of guns andviolence goes beyond his parish, adding: ``What we do here isalmost insignificant.''   Besides enlisting the support of other Denver parishes, Gourleyalso called on ``all people of good will in the metro area'' todiscard their weapons because ``there are simply too many guns.''   ``I fully support him,'' Zavaras said. ``I have strong feelingsabout gun control and the unlawful carrying of weapons.''   Pena, who regularly attends Our Lady of Guadalupe, thanked theparishioners who supported the program Sunday.</TEXT></DOC>
