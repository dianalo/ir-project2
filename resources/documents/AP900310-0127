In the Ukrainian city of Kiev, an activist said a crowdestimated at 50,000 gathered for a pro-democracy election rally.   In Nazran, thousands of Ingushi residents held their fifth dayof protests, calling for restoration of their autonomous republicin their southern homeland, Tass reported.   Hundreds of thousands of Ingushi residents were deported fromtheir homes in the Caucasus in 1944 after dictator Josef Stalinaccused them of collaboration with the Nazis.   Ingushi protesters insisted their demand for restoration oftheir homeland did not mean they intended to oust the Ossetians nowliving in the area, Tass said. There is a Checheno-Ingushirepublic, but much of the Ingushi land was allocated to what is nowNorthern Ossetia when the natives were deported.   In Tbilisi, a crowd gathered at the Museum of Marxism-Leninismand then occupied it to demand office space for non-Communistpolitical groups. Authorities agreed, and the incident endedpeacefully.   The crowd was estimated by police at 1,200 and by activists at3,000.   In Kiev, speakers said election rigging was rampant in theUkraine. But democratic candidates for the Ukrainian parliamenthave still won 33 races and advanced to runoffs in 120 others, saidYaroslav Tropimov of the Rukh people's front.   Activists claim 10 percent of the ballots cast in the town ofIvankov were falsified to benefit Ukrainian Communist Party secondsecretary Stanislav Gurenko, Tropimov said.
