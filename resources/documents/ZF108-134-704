 First step -- buy an80286 computer (or 80386 if you want a UNIX environment).andP;  Second step -- buya suitable card from either Dialogic or their two main competitors --Innovative Technologies or Natural Microsystems.andM;Third step -- buy and, more importantly, learn how to use anvoice-processing-specific &quot;applications generator&quot; (again, if you're notready to program from scratch -- see sidebar).andM;Application generators are software packages that both people with little orno programming experience and bigtime programmers (who crave a fastdevelopment tool) use to make sophisticated end-user voice-processingapplications.andP;  These applications include voice mail, automated attendant andinformation-provider services.andM;Application generators free the developer from the hassles of a programmingenvironment, allowing him or her to focus simply on application logic flowand efficiency.andP;  And since they've been extensively tested, both in-house bythe software provider and by other developers, your application, given aconsistent logic flow, should be bug free.andM;While application generators require only basic programming skills,fundamental programming concepts (like loops, conditional branching, etc.)andO;are necessary.andP;  To develop sophisticated applications, you have to be able tocreate a complete application flow chart.andM;There are two basic types of application generators: tree structured (formoriented or menu driven); and high-level development languages.andP;  Both do thetrick.andP;  The decision as to which to use is dependant upon one's experienceand personal preference.andM;TREE STRUCTUREDandM;Tree-structured menu-driven or form-oriented application generators aresoftware packages that allow the developer to create an application tree.andP;  Inthe menu-driven type, the developer makes selections from menus.andP;  In theform-oriented type, the developer fills in a &quot;form&quot; specifying an inputstate, an action and an exit state.andM;They are straight forward to use.andP;  In a few hours one can become proficientenough to begin application development.andP;  The tree structure allows veryrapid development -- simple trees can be created and run in minutes.andM;Since the tree uses standardized code, created trees require very littlemaintenance and modifications can be made easily.andP;  And the time to comeup-to-speed on an existing tree is short, so little support time is lost withnew personnel.andM;Most tree structured application generators support running multiple treesconcurrently, allowing separate applications to run on different ports.andM;The people who make application generators try to make the developer's taskas easy as possible.andP;  Most include provisions for common telephony protocol,such as hookflash for call transfers.andP;  Some software providers, such asExpert Systems, include default settings for the specific environment, suchas customized call analysis parameters for a particular PBX.andM;While tree-structured application generators allow you to set up a bunch ofdifferent application things, some provide an interface to developer-createdfunctions, such as Telephone Response Technology's (TRT) C languageinterface.andP;  This allows the developer to include anything he or she mayrequire.andM;Tree-structured generators generally offer statistics on the activity ofchannels in an application.andP;  The access to those statistics differs.andP;  Forexample, the Intellisys package by TRT provides a comprehensive set ofmanagement reports.andP;  It also allows the collection of statistics in adBASEIII format, giving the user the power of a relational database insorting and report generation.andM;All of the available packages differ in the features they provide, which maymake one better suited for a specific environment.andP;  For example, ExpertSystems' EASE and Valor Telecom's Infotree provide an interface for IBMmainframe cluster controller emulation.andM;Most offer RS-232 serial port support.andP;  Intellisys and Stok Software'sTeletree offer remote prompt recording for applications that require rapidprompt updating.andP;  Infotree also allows an application to run only at certainhours, so that different portions of a multiple tree structure can rundepending upon the time of day.andM;DEVELOPMENTandM;LANGUAGESandM;Even though development languages are high-level programming languages, theyrequire relatively modest programming skills.andP;  The programmer's big concernremains the application flow.andP;  The system architecture is still handled bythe application generator.andM;The basic components of the development language package are a multitaskingexecutive and a language compiler.andP;  The executive handles the real-timeapplication execution, servicing port events and coordinating systemactivities such as file access, serial port communication, screen I/O,keyboard input, etc.andM;The language compiler processes high-level commands (in plain English) intomachine understandable code.andP;  All of the low-level coding is done by thecompiler, again freeing the programmer to concentrate on the applicationlogic, with the assurance that the extensively tested compiler will correctlyconvert his design into a well behaved piece of code.andM;Again, only elementary programming skills are required for the use of theselanguages.andP;  Generally, someone familiar with BASIC or dBASE would have littledifficulty.andP;  The programming concepts used are labels, loops, conditionalbranching, etc.andM;The executive is generally set up to partition the phone ports to one portper program partition.andP;  The partitions then run the application program.andP;  Thesame program may run on multiple partitions (i.e.andP;  channels) ordifferent-programs may run on different channels.andM;This last thing is a very important consideration.andP;  Even experiencedprogrammers who want to create applications that can direct the caller todifferent &quot;applications&quot; by dynamically accessing those &quot;applications&quot; from amain program (i.e.andP;  run multiple applications on several phone lines) wouldhave a tough time bringing this off.andP;  This code already exists in thedevelopment language executive.andP;  Again, no need to reinvent the wheel.andM;The various development languages have different features that will make oneor the other more attractive to a developer.andP;  US Telecom's VAL offers a dBASEIII interface, along with a speak command that converts a text string into aphrase to play over the phone line.andM;CONCLUSIONandM;There are several application development tools that are useful to a widerange of potential developers.andM;Tree-structured ones are well suited to non-programmers or those with littleprogramming experience.andP;  They create application trees by having thedeveloper make selections from menus.andP;  They have a short learning time, butare still very powerful and have many statistical reporting features.andP;  Anexperienced programmer, however, may find the tree-structured type cumbersomeand limiting.andM;Application-generator development languages are geared to the developerfamiliar with programming concepts who wants to minimize his or herdevelopment time and be able to concentrate on application logic as opposedto programming internals.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
