The population of the Naples, Fla., area grew faster than that of any other metropolitan area between 1980 and 1987, surging 48.8% to 127,900.    All of the 61 metropolitan areas that grew at a pace twice as fast as the nation as a whole are in the South or West. The population of the entire country grew 7.4% between 1980 and 1987.    Other Florida metropolitan areas on the Census Bureau's top 10 list are Ocala, Fort Myers-Cape Coral, Fort Pierce, the Cape Canaveral area, West Palm Beach and Orlando. All but Orlando are largely resort or retirement communities, the Census Bureau said.    Metropolitan areas outside Florida making the top 10 list are Austin, Texas, McAllen-Edinburg-Mission, Texas, and Las Cruces, N.M.    The government defines a metropolitan area as &quot;a population nucleus&quot; of at least 50,000, usually a city, plus its immediate suburbs and adjacent communities &quot;having a high degree of economic and social integration.&quot; The Census Bureau now identifies 282 such areas.    Among big cities, the fastest-growing metropolitan areas are Phoenix, up 29.8% in the period, and Dallas-Fort Worth, up 27.1%.    Of the 54 areas that lost population between 1980 and 1987, 41 were in the Northeast and Midwest. The biggest percentage decline in population was in Duluth, Minn., where the Census Bureau estimates the population fell 9.4%. </TEXT></DOC>
