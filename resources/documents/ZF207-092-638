Suchanek, chiefjudge of the GSA Board of Contract Appeals (GSBCA).andM;Suchanek went on record as disagreeing with the decision by two colleagues todismiss the MCI protest on the grounds that the Washington company was &quot;notan interested party&quot; to the procurement.andM;Martin Marietta's protest, filed as an administrative complaint before theFTS 2000 contracting officer, Carol A. Hall, also was rejected.andM;Both protests were based on a tariff that ATandamp;T Co. filed with the FederalCommunications Commission covering the rates it will charge for FTS 2000services [GCN, Feb. 20].andM;ATandamp;T had asked that the precise rates in the tariff be kept secret.andM;Martin Marietta and MCI essentially claimed the tariff filing did not satisfysome of the FTS 2000 requirements for a 10-year, firm, fixed-price contract.andM;Hall, in a three-page opinion sent to Martin Marietta attorneys, said theATandamp;T tariff &quot;contains the requisite commitments by ATandamp;T that ATandamp;T willestablish separate accounting procedures [for FTS 2000] as required by theFCC, and that ATandamp;T's stockholders will bear any losses&quot; stemming from thepricing.andM;'Commitment' CitedandM;She also assured Martin Marietta that ATandamp;T has made a &quot;contractualcommitment&quot; to GSA to ensure that agencies do not pay more than certainprices for switched voice service, and she said this price cap was notrequired in the tariff filing, as Martin Marietta had alleged.andM;GSBCA Judge Vincent A. LaBella wrote the majority opinion rejecting the MCIprotest, on behalf of himself and Judge Edwin B. Neill.andM;LaBella wrote that MCI did not come before the panel as an &quot;interested party&quot;with grounds to protest, because it was a subcontractor to Martin Marietta.andO;MCI claims to have a stake in the matter because it expects to bid as a primeshould the board overturn the award to ATandamp;T.andM;&quot;The fact that protester stands ready to be a prospective offerer does notrender it an interested party in this case,&quot; LaBella's opinion said.andM;In his dissent, Suchanek argued that to determine whether MCI was aninterested party, the panel should simply examine the protester's status asan offerer or potential offerer and the &quot;degree of its financial interest&quot; inthe contract award.andM;&quot;Protester could play as a significant role in meeting the government'srequirement under the procurement.andP;  Such is sufficient to establish protesteras a de facto offerer with a direct economic interest in the award,&quot; Suchaneksaid.andP;  &quot;Therefore, we should find protester to be an interested party topursue a protest.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
