On August 19, 1983,SBA published an Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (48 FR 37658). Afterconsideration of the voluminous comments, we published a Notice of ProposedRulemaking (NPRM) on August 21, 1985 (50 FR 33766), which discussed thecomments received, the changes made and the reasons therefor. The Noticeagain yielded extensive comments, most of which are discussed below. Sectionsnot discussed below have been discussed in the earlier Notices, have notbeen commented on this time and remain unchanged. These discussions arenot repeated here. General comments, either praising or condemning SBA'ssurety bond guarantee program and the current revision as a whole, arenot referred to or commented upon.The considerable lapse of time since the publication of the NPRM has necessitatedseveral changes, identified hereafter, for which no public comments havebeen obtained. In each such instance SBA requests comments now. Such commentswill be carefully considered, and_if accepted_will be the subject of earlyamendments to this revision.The NPRM had proposed two new guarantee agreements, instead of the formersingle agreement. One was to be ``national,'' reserved for the most activeparticipants, the other for all others. The intent was to offer preferredtreatment under the ``national'' agreement. See advance notice of proposedrulemaking, 48 FR 37658 (Aug. 19, 1983). Since then, congressional effortsto reduce the deficit, such as the so-called Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law,and paralled efforts towards budgetary restraints by the national Administration,have so reduced SBA's flexibility that a meaningful difference betweenthe two agreements is no longer possible. Accordingly, the proposal hasbeen abandoned, and a single Form 990, in revised form, adopted (see AppendixA, below).With the simplification, it has also become possible to eliminate a requirementof accounting for premiums and losses, previously contained in Art. IXof the National Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement. SBA invites comments onthis change.The new regulation also redefines ``Loss'' and other terms (andSection;115.4),tightens application procedures (andSection;andSection;115.5 through 115.9)and audit requirements (andSection;115.17). SBA will no longer regulate premiums[andSection;115.11(a)] or impose a ``deductible'' (see discussion under andSection;115.14).SBA invites comments on this change.  Section 115.3(a) Policy_Congressional Intent.A comment stated the need for flexibility in the statutory ceiling whenbids are adjusted upwards or awarded contracts are changed, in view ofthe requirement of many obligatory governmental bond forms of a waiverof notice to or consent of the surety to such change. The statute, however,limited SBA's authority to contracts up to $1,000,000 and SBA was withoutauthority to guarantee bonds for contracts which exceeded that amount.Since the publication of the prior notice the statutory limit has beenincreased to $1,250,000 [Pub. L. 99-272, approved April 7, 1986]. Accordingly,the statutory limit has been changed throughout this publication. Regardingflexibility, see ``Loss After Excess Contract Amount'' in discussion underandSection;115.4.Section 115.3(b). Policy_Types of Bonds. A paragraph, inadvertently omitted in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,restores to these regulations a part of former paragraph andSection;115.2(c)which limits the guarantee eligibility of bonds to those listed in the``Contract Bonds'' section of the Rating Manual of the Surety Associationof America, excepting therefrom bonds in the nature of a financial guarantee.Section 115.3(c). Policy_Guarantee Agreement. The name of SBA's office in charge of this program has been changed to``Office of Surety Guarantees'' throughout this rule._A well reasoned commentpointed out that the criteria proposed for the division of premiums andlosses between the Surety and SBA contained several subjective elements(<T3>e.g.,</T3> ``adequacy of the Surety's underwriting and credit analysis'');that there were other subjective criteria of equal importance omitted;and that the most important criterion, in which the subjective criteriaare objectively reflected, is the ``bottom line,'' the relevant loss experience.Accordingly, SBA has revised its criteria to focus on a Surety's Loss rateand its rating by recognized authority. Two new elements, in line withthe program's basic purpose, have been added: (1) The average dollar penaltyper bond, reflecting the targeting of SBA's bond guarantee toward the smallercontracts, and (2) the ratio of bid to final bonds, reflecting the costof acquisition of business. We believe that the greatest need for bondguarantees is for the smaller (under $100,000) contracts, where the acquisitioncost in relation to the premium is highest, and that a Surety's volumeof bid bonds which do not ripen into final bonds is a good indication ofthe Surety's concern for small business._SBA has determined that, giventhe available budget authority and the demand for surety bond guarantees,the maximum guarantees should be administratively limited to 80%, in orderto satisfy a greater portion of such demand. (For a fuller explanation,see 51 FR 20922; June 9, 1986.)Section 115.3(e). Premium and Guarantee Fee. This subsection has been revised and moved to andSection;115.11, Fees andPremiums, so that both fees charged by SBA to the Surety and the Principal,and fees charged by the Surety to the Principal will be found in the samesection. Section 115.3(e). Timeliness. This subsection specifies in what circumstances SBA will issue a guaranteeafter work under the contract to be bonded has begun. One comment objectedto SBA ever guaranteeing a bond after work had started, because the oddsare that the job is in trouble. SBA rejects this suggestion, because thereare legitimate possibilities why work may have started without the SBA'sguarantee. A new form, SBA Form 991, elicits information in these caseswhich would disclose whether or not a belated application is legitimate_Anothercomment proposed a 30 or 60 day period [from the time of the award] afterwhich SBA would refuse to guarantee the bond. This proposal is not adoptedeither, because in many cases the work may be completed in less than 30(or 60) days, or the work may be delayed by seasonal factors._Several commentsobjected to the timeliness requirement, as such, on the grounds that itis an underwriting consideration which should depend on information availableto Surety. SBA views this issue as one of statutory eligibility: Sincethe statute commands that the bond be required for the contractor to serveon a contract, and be unavailable to the contractor without an SBA guarantee,it follows that if the contractor was allowed to serve without a bond,the bond was not required, and if the contractor has obtained a bond withoutSBA's guarantee, it follows that it was available without such guarantee.SBA cannot accept liability for a bond which does not meet the expressconditions of the statute. If SBA purported to guarantee such a bond, itdid so without statutory authority, and consequently the guarantee wouldbe void.Section 115.4. Definitions. ``Amount of Contract.'' This definition distinguishes between eligible and ineligible ``phased''projects. SBA's standard operating procedure, SOP 50 45 1 (May 13, 1983)explains as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">A phased project is a total work project divided into two or moreparts. For each part (or phase) of the project, there must be a separateand identifiable contract and bond. The first phase must be completed andthe surety and SBA released before the second phase is begun; and so onuntil all phases are completed, to avoid adding the amount of the firstcontract to the second in order to determine the [$1,250,000] eligibilitylimitation.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">An example of a properly phased project would be a single buildingproject divided/phased into (1) grading, (2) construction of the building,and (3) landscaping. Each phase would require a separate and identifiablecontract and bond, and the first phase contract could be completed andsurety and SBA released before the second phase is begun. An example ofan unacceptable phased project would be one which provided separate contractsand bonds for walls, flooring, wiring, plumbing, roof, etc., but lackedthe requirement of a definitive release after completion of the first phasebefore the next phase is begun. Much of the work, in this example of anunacceptable phased project, must go on simultaneously.</ITAG>A comment questions whether this policy is to be changed and went on topose specific hypothetical questions: Renovation of several schools forone school district; one site with several owners (<T3>e.g.,</T3> fairground); consecutive contracts for work on a singlesite; multi-year contracts, <T3>e.g.,</T3> janitorial or supply contracts renewable at the sole optionof the obligee); cost overruns and change orders which may or may not bringthe contract amount above the statutory limit. In response, SBA has rewrittenthis definition and replaced the undefined term ``integral project'' withthe defined term ``single project.'' The rule now provides that phasedprojects at the same locality with the same obligee are eligible if thebond on the preceding phase is released before performance of the succeedingphase begins. In this view most of the above hypothetical situations areeligible if this single condition is met. The hypothetical case of multipleobligees (<T3>e.g., </T3>fairground) is outside the purview of the definition whichis limited to a single obligee; the cost overrun/change order case is governedby andSection;115.15(c) and the Loss definition ``after excess contract amount''in andSection;115.4 of this Part. Section 115.15(c) permits an increase upto the lesser of $50,000 or 25% in the bond liability without SBA approval,to conform to the Federal Acquisition Regulation, 48 CFR Ch. I, 28.106-5(a)(2)(ii)._Further,the definition of ``Contract amount'' has been made more precise in measuringthe contract amount as of the time of issuance of the executed (guaranteed)bond, instead of the date of SBA's guarantee. The reason for this changeis that SBA's guarantee becomes effective with the Surety's issuance ofthe executed bond and the award of the contract; until then the Suretyand SBA have the right to cancel.Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Bid Bond.''A new clause sets an automatic expiration for a bid bond guarantee oneyear after issuance. The reason therefor is the budgetary restraint referredto before: It is undesirable to tie up budgetary authority indefinitely.In almost all cases a bid bond will be moot within a year, but if it isnecessary to keep it active, a new bid bond guarantee should be requested.SBA invites comments on this change.Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Contract.'' Several comments pointed out that the proposed definition of ``contract''excludes many contract warranties which are customarily required in certainindustries, and thus excludes a large proportion of small business contractsfrom eligibility of this program. In response, SBA has amended the definitionto include warranties of materials and workmanship up to two years, andto include, in SBA's descretion, other ancillary and coterminous warranties(by a separate writing) on a showing that such warranties are customarilyrequired in the relevant trade or industry. Contracts of warranty not ancillaryand coterminous to an otherwise eligible contract remain ineligible. Itwas further represented that release of lien bonds sometimes are the bestand least expensive way to handle a contract bond claim. SBA does not disputethe usefulness of such bonds. However, a release of lien (or stop notice)bond is acceptable to SBA only if issued against a claim under an SBA guaranteedbond, but not otherwise. Section 115.4. Definitions. ``Issuance'' or ``issued'' has been defined to make clear that the SBAguarantee and the execution by the Surety of a bond do not create, of themselves,an obligation on SBA's part. For SBA's guarantee to become effective, Suretymust release the bond beyond its ability to retrieve it, the Contract mustbe awarded to the Principal and the Surety must be bound to the Contract.Of course, all other statutory and regulatory requirements must also bemet. Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Loss under Bid Bond.'' Several comments pointed out that forfeiture bonds, barred by the proposeddefinition, are required by law on public works contracts in some States,and that the proposed definition disqualifies small business contractorsin such cases from guarantee eligibility. In response, SBA has enlargedthe definition to accommodate such forfeiture bid bonds. Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Loss under Payment Bond.'' Three comments pointed out that the proposed definition was at once toobroad and too restrictive. It was too broad in that it would have coverednon-contract claims such as job-site accidents. It was too narrow in thatit did not allow for possible interest and legal cost (of opposing attorney)which the Surety may have to pay in addition to the penal sum. The definitionnow limits claims against the principal to those for unpaid labor and suppliesand allows for interest and legal expenses of the claimant in additionto the penal sum. Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Loss under Performance Bond.'' Comments received explained that the clause ``Sums necessary to perform''did not allow for completion cost incurred by third parties (<T3>e.g., </T3>the obligee), and that the definition did not allow forexpenses additional to the penal sum, as in the preceding comment. Thedefinition now provides ``sums necessary to meet the cost of fulfillingthe terms of the Contract'' and adds legal expenses to the penal sum, asin the preceding definition. Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Loss adjustment expenses.'' This paragraph generated more comments than any other because it seemedto disallow all ``external'' and unallocated ``internal'' claims adjustmentexpenses. This was not SBA's intent, since SBA's principal reliance incost control matters will be the ``bottom line'' loss experience, whichreflects all expenses. Accordingly, the definition now distinguishes betweenallocated and unallocated expenses, instead of between internal and externalexpenses, and requires that the allocation method follow generally acceptedaccounting principles. One comment pointed out, moreover, that the limitationsto expenses ``resulting from the breach'' did not allow for expenses ofsuccessful resistance to a claimed breach. In response, SBA recognizesexpenditures resulting from defenses against an ``asserted'' breach, whetheror not successfully asserted.Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Loss from litigation cost.'' The prior SBA consent requirement for suits by the surety against the UnitedStates attracted unfavorable comments. It was pointed out that such suitswould probably be brought for contract balances, or asserted as counterclaims or cross claims. The proposed definition spoke of ``suits filedagainst'' the U.S. The final version makes explicit that cross and counterclaims are not considered ``suits filed.'' SBA, however, does not wantto give up its right to consent to suits filed against the U.S., for thereason stated in the proposal: ``in such suits the major share of suchexpense might be borne by the Federal Government'' (50 FR, <T3>supra, </T3>at 33767). If SBA is unable to bring about a settlementof such claims, permission to file suit would be expeditiously grantedby the Office of Surety Guarantees. If such suits were filed by the suretywithout SBA's consent, the surety would not be entitled to reimbursementof the guaranteed percentage, but would be entitled to deduct the entirerelated litigation expense from judgment proceeds before sharing the recoverywith SBA pursuant to andSection; 115.14 of this Part. Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Loss from attorney's fees and damages.''Several comments objected to the exclusion of legal expenses of suretiesin suits by a principal against the surety. They stressed that suits byprincipals could stem from the surety's subrogation to the principal'sclaims, or from the principal's resistance to indemnification. Thus, theexclusion would discourage the surety from protecting its own and SBA'sinterest and relying instead on SBA's guarantee. In response, SBA has retainedthe exclusion only for original suits sounding in tort (<T3>e.g., </T3>bad faith or negligence), but not for counterclaims soundingin tort, since it would be difficult to separate the legal costs of thedefense from the counterclaim. Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Loss after Excess Contract Amount.'' In response to comments that SBA should accommodate contracts where theface amount was below the statutory limit ($1,250,000) at the time of issuanceof the guaranteed bond, but was increased beyond that limit by permissiblechange orders, SBA has adopted a loss liability limit which reflects boththe excess of the contract amount over the statutory limit, and the agreedguarantee percentage. Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Obligee.'' This definition was criticized as mislabelling the beneficiaries of a paymentbond as obligees, thereby creating inadvertently semantic confusion withthe obligee-owner. The definition now tracks the statutory language, 15U.S.C. 694a(5). The meaning here is that the obligation of the paymentbond to deliver a lien-free job runs to the obligee-owner, while laborand materialmen are the beneficiaries of that obligation._The co-obligeerestriction has been clarified to make clear (1) that a co-obligee mustshare fully the obligations of the original obligee to the principal and(2) to allow agencies like HUD or FHA to be named without being bound tothe Principal. Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Payment Bond.'' A comment explained that under the law of certain states (<T3>e.g., </T3>Washington) a bond ``conditioned'' on payment is not a paymentbond, but a performance/indemnity bond, unless the bond or a statute expresslygives a right of action to third-party payment claimants. SBA has replacedthe words ``persons under contract with the principal'' to include allsuppliers of labor and materials to the job who have a right of actionagainst the bond. This definition of ``payment bond'' now harmonizes withthat under ``Loss.'' Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Performance Bond.'' This definition (``completion * * * of a Contract'') was criticized astoo broad, because a contract may only call for a part of the work (<T3>e.g., </T3>the construction work) called for under the contract. Thedefinition is a statutory one [15 U.S.C. 694a(3)], and does not, in SBA'sopinion, exclude a bond for a contract which only calls for the completionof a partial job if such completion releases the bond. Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Premium.''This definition is new. It was added in response to a comment explainingthat in certain States (<T3>e.g.,</T3> Washington) all charges by a Surety to a principal are statutorilydefined as ``premium,'' including extra charges for extra services (<T3>e.g.,</T3> title reports, substitution of collateral). To accommodatethis problem, ``premium'' is now defined as the approved rate applied tothe contract or bond amount, excluding charges for extra services. SBAexpects that this definition will assure nationwide uniformity of interpretation.Section 115.4. Definitions: ``Surety.''The definition was amended in response to a comment pointing out that incertain States under a typical public works bond the surety may be liableto lower tier persons even if the principal has properly paid the firsttier person, <T3>e.g.,</T3> the unpaid supplier to a properly paid subcontractor ofthe principal. The definition now includes all persons having a right ofaction against the payment bond under local law, and harmonizes with bothdefinitions of ``payment bond'' under ``loss'' and under ``payment bond.''_Anothercomment proposed to narrow the definition as to agents, underwriters andother persons empowered to act for the surety by describing them furtheras having ``written authority to approve bonds, evidenced in writing toSBA.'' SBA rejects this proposal which would unduly restrict the statutorydefinition which this definition tracks, see section 410(4) of the SmallBusiness Investment Act of 1958, 15 U.S.C. 694a(4). For example, an independentagent may be empowered to act for a surety by presigned bonds._An oversightin the NPRM has been remedied. The rule now includes a Surety determinedby SBA to be eligible. This clause, contained in former andSection; 115.3(b)(2),``grandfathers in'' a participant of long standing not on the Treasurylist. SBA no longer admits such Sureties to participation.Section 115.5(b). Character. Several comments complained that requiring good character of each ownerof 10% or more of the equity of the principal places an unreasonable burdenon the surety which, to substantiate a thorough investigation and underwriting,would have to check the records of as many as ten equity holders. Theyfurther pointed out that personal history statements are required onlyof the holders of 20% or more of the equity [andSection;115.6(a)] and thatthese two provisions should be consistent. In deference to these comments,SBA has raised the threshold to 20%. It should also be noted that the determinationof good character lies with SBA, and that it is not reasonable to supposethat SBA (in the works of one comment) would expect the ``impossible.''_Inresponse to a comment discussed under andSection; 115.12 below, SBA has addeda third element which disqalifies a Principal, <T3>i.e., </T3>fraud, material misrepresentation or failure to meet thecontractural requirement under a bonding line commitment to inform suretyof unbonded contracts. Such fairlure amounts to a material misrepresentationsince it disables the surety from properly monitoring its commitment.Section 115.5(e). Partial Subcontract.In order to exclude from bond guarantee eligiblity those contractors whoare essentially brokers or packagers, SBA requires a certification of thepercentage of the contract to be performed by the bonded principal iteself.A comment warned that a principal may subcontract a substantial percentageof the contract to suppliers of materials, see definition of ``Contract''in 115.4, and that such percentage should not be counted against the principal.In response, SBA has added words which make clear that it is the percentageof the ``work under'' the contract which is to be measured, as distinguishedfrom all other subcontracts, including those for materials.Section 115.6(a). Application procedure. The filing of a guarantee application by surety is deemed to representa certification by such surety that the statutory requirements with respectto the underwriting risk would be met when the bond is issued. The regulationalso requires that surety furnish SBA in true copy of its agent's power-of-attorney(including any limitation thereon) before or with such agent's first requestfor a guarantee, and a renewal notice of or before the expiration dateof such power._Several comments questioned the cost/benefit ratio of requiringPersonal History Statements (SBA Form 912) from a Contractor. These commentsstressed that no money passes to the contractors, as it does in the loanprogram, that on default money passes to the Surety, and through the Suretyto the claimants, from whom no such form is required. They further correctlypointed out that, in contradistinction to the loan program, little or nottime is available for a check on these forms before SBA is committed, thatthe paperwork burden is the principal obstacle to private sector participationin the program, and that in actual experience the form has made a differencein less than ten out of 180,000 or more guaranteed bonds (and many timesas many guarantee applications). SBA nevertheless feels that its fiduciaryobligation to the public purse requires it to inform itself on the characterof those contractors for whose benefit SBA issues its guarantees._A commentproposed to establish criteria for financial statements of applicants,along the lines of those adopted by the American Institute of CertifiedPublic Accountants, graduated according to the contract amount from ``compilation''to ``fully audited'' statements. These regulations, however, do not requirefinancial statements. Accordingly, SBA can set no standards. Financialstatements are received with the underwriting review (SBA Form 994B) andare discussed in SBA's underwriting guidelines which have no regulatoryforce, and therefore cannot bind applicants._One comment queried whetherthe disclosure requirement regarding business or family relationships betweenthe surety and its agent on the one hand, and the contractor on the other,also called for a negative statement if no such relationship exists. SBAwill not require such negative statement and will deem a failure to makesuch disclosure equivalent to a negative statement.Section 115.7. Approval or decline procedures. Subsection (b) has been stricken and proposed subsections (c) and (d) renumbered(b) and (c), respectively. SBA has determined that the imposition of ``specialconditions'' on Form 990 leads to misunderstandings, and that careful underwritingrequires the compliance with a condition before, rather than after, a guaranteeis executed. Accordingly, new Form 990 does not provide for a special condition.Where a special condition cannot be met before SBA's execution of Form990 (as where it can only be met after award of the contract), a specialwriting will be prepared, signed by Surety and SBA will constitute a supplementalagreement. If the supplemental agreement requires something of the principal,it will be incumbent upon Surety to ensure compliance. Violation of suchsupplemental agreement will void SBA's guarantee. SBA invites commentson this change._Former subsection (c)_now (b)_has been amended to reflectthe concentration of the surety bond program in the field to regional SBAoffices. Paragraph (b) establishes an appeal procedure for rejected guaranteeapplications, available to Sureties but not to their clients, with thefinal Agency decision lodged in the Associate Administrator for Financeand Investment at the Central Office. This provision is patterned afterformer andSection; 115.8(b)._A new paragraph (c) has been added, to requirethe Surety to submit to SBA within 45 days of the effective date of SBA'sguarantee of the final bonds, the contractor's fee and contract specifics,failing which SBA's guarantee shall be void from its inception, unlessthe Surety can show that the contract is not then in default and the failurehas a valid reason. This provision parallels that under the bonding lineprovision [andSection; 11512(f) and (g)] and is necessary to enable SBA toutilize its budget authority without encumbering it with provision forfinal bonds that may not have been issued. SBA invites comments on thisprovision.Section 115.8. Underwriting standards. Two comments questioned the requirement that sureties adhere to standardsset forth in SBA's Standard Operating Procedure 50-45, as amended, becausea surety could never be certain that their copy reflected the latest amendment.This apprehension is not justified, because SBA's recommended underwritingconsiderations are well known to the industry, and are communicated routinelyto sureties doing business with the SBA. Sureties planning to do businesswith SBA for the first time are put on notice by this regulation that theyshould obtain a copy for their guidance. It is reproduced below as AppendixB.Section 115.9. SBA review of surety's underwriting.It was proposed that sureties should present to SBA in writing their underwritingpolicies and procedures. This proposal is rejected on the grounds thatit would tend to eliminate competition among sureties.Section 115.10. Reinstatement after default or failure to pay guaranteefee.This proposed section has been rewritten because it was found to be atvariance with SBA's actual practice. SBA has not and will not reinstatea defaulting contractor before such contractor has undertaken to reimburseboth Surety and SBA for their loss caused by such default._Clarificationwas requested by a comment as to when a ``claim filed'' triggers transferof the contractor's file to the Central Office, thus preventing furtherSBA surety bond guarantees. The final regulation makes clear that it is(1) the filing of a suit against the bond, or (2) the establishment ofa claim reserve by the Surety, (3) a request from the Surety for paymentby SBA, or (4) failure by the principal to pay its guarantee fee, whichtriggers the transfer. This gives the contractor more time to work outdifficulties without incurring effective disbarment from SBA assistance.Moreover, the final rule reserves the right to SBA not to transfer thefile to Central Office, if in SBA's and the Surety's judgment the issuanceof further bond guarantees would help in the mitigation of loss._The samecomment also reflected an understanding that the requirement of monthlyclaims reporting precludes a surety from making a claim for loss laterif the Surety forbears making a timely claim (in the interest of the work-outdiscussed above). This understanding is not SBA's intent. Section 115.14(Claims for losses) leaves to the surety the decision when to request reimbursement(see discussion under andSection; 115.14). The Standard Operating Procedure50-45 elaborates on the notice requirements for anticipated claims as distinguishedfrom claims for reimbursement._Another comment criticized the provisionof paragraph (a)(3) that a contractor may be reinstated after dischargein bankruptcy. The comment views this provision as inviting an easy wayout of the consequences of prior default. This comment misapprehends thepurpose of the bankruptcy laws, which is the rehabilitation of the debtor.It also overlooks the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, whichemphasizes past experience as an underwriting factor.Section 115.11(a). Surety's Premium.This subsection has been moved from andSection; 115.3(e) of the proposedrule, to assemble all fee and premium provisions in the same section. Ithas also been revised in response to comments that the word ``premium''has different meanings in some States as compared to others. For example,Texas permits charging rates in excess of those of the Surety Associationof America, if consented to by the Principal (the ``consent to rate'').With this exception, Surety Association rates are mandatory in Texas andLouisiana. Accordingly, the final rule avoids the word ``premium'' (definedin andSection; 115.4) and limits charges to those authorized by the appropriateinsurance department, and allows for a ``consent to rate.''_Several commentsobjected to the removal of a maximum or ``cap'' on charges sureties areallowed to make to contractors. SBA has determined that this policy, whileit may lead to increased premiums for small concerns, is necessary in viewof the continued attrition in the bonding industry. In December 1985, theSurety Association of America (SAA), representing the standard (as distinguishedfrom the high risk) sureties, filed for a 20% premium increase to compensatefor greater losses. As of June 1987, this increase was cleared in all jurisdictionswhere it was filed, excepting only South Carolina where it was temporarilywithdrawn. On June 5, 1987, SAA made a new filing, on grounds of a worsenedcrisis in the industry, proposing a further rate increase of 20.4%. Inaddition, SAA introduced a special graduated rate for smaller jobs, beginningat $25 per thousand dollars for jobs under $100,000 [$100,000 is the averagejob size for the SBG program]. These rate increases will raise the standardsurety contract bond rate to a level greater than that permitted by SBAuntil now in its high risk program. In view of the continuing rate escalationin the standard risk industry, SBA's deregulation of premiums (which remainsubject to State regulation) seems the best way to keep the high risk industry(and the SBG program) viable._One comment criticized the prohibition againstan agent's requirement that a contractor purchase casualty insurance orother services as a condition of bonding. This prohibition was termed unrealisticand unenforceable. It was said that the decision where and what insuranceto buy should be left to the businessman, and ``not to the heavy hand ofgovernmental regulations,'' SBA has nevertheless determined to protectits program from such possible overreaching, while at the same time leavingthe freedom of decision to the small business. The regulation does notprohibit the simultaneous purchase of various services; it merely prohibitsmaking such purchase a condition of the sale of bonding._Another commentproposed a regulatory minimum rate which would preempt certain State maximumrates which are too low to justify issuing bonds. SBA rejects this proposalto interfere with State regulation._One writer queried whether the Principal'sguarantee fee ``to be remitted to SBA by Surety or Principal'' is to besubmitted by the agent or the home office. Since the definition of ``Surety''in the statute [see 15 U.S.C. 694a(4)] and the regulation (see andSection;115.4) does not distinguish between the bonding company and its agent(s),either many remit the fee to SBA with the application on SBA Form 994.Section 115.11(b). Formerly 115.11(a).SBA Charge to Principal. The requirement of adjusting the contractor'sguarantee fee in consequence of changes in the contract or bond amount,contained in Article VIII of Appendix A of the NPRM, has been dropped forthe reason stated under paragraph (c) of this section (lack of cost-effectiveness).Section 115.11(c). SBA charge to Surety.In the NPRM it was proposed to express SBA's guarantee fee to Surety asa percentage of the bond premium. Given the volatility of the surety bondmarket and the need to adjust promptly to changes, SBA has determined thatthe guarantee charge should be expressed in dollars and calculated on thesame basis (contract or bond amount) as the Surety's own premiums. Thedollar amount will be stated on the face of the guarantee agreement, SBAForm 990. This paragraph now also provides that SBA must be advised ofcontract changes of $10,000 or more. SBA will neither charge nor refundto the Surety a proportionate part of the guarantee fee in the event ofan increase or decrease in the contract amount. A study has shown thatover the past five years (1983-1987) the difference between premium increasesand decreases due to premium adjustments of more than $15 (the former triggerpoint) amounted to 30andCx.11; in surety fees and to $2.90 in contractorfees per bonding_a difference making such remittances not cost-effective.Changes in contract or bond amount in excess of 25% or $50,000 requireSBA approval_see andSection; 115.15(c) of this Part.Section 115.12(b). Bonding line underwriting.Subsection (b) asks of the surety that it require the principal benefitingfrom a bonding line to keep the surety informed of all contracts, bothbonded and unbonded. The obvious reason is that unbonded contracts cancontribute to a default under a bonded contract, <T3>e.g.</T3>, because the principal is overextended. A comment asked whatthe effect would be of a failure by the principal to keep the Surety informed.In the first instance, SBA would expect the Surety to cancel the bondingline in such event. Second, SBA would honor its guarantee if the suretyin good faith met its obligation to require the principal to furnish theinformation. Thirdly, SBA has added a third disqualification to the ``goodcharacter'' requirement of andSection; 115.5(b) equating failure to keepthe surety informed of unbonded contracts with a material misrepresentation.Accordingly, a contractor who violated the requirement would be disbarredfrom any further SBA bonding assistance.Section 115.12(f). Submission of forms of SBA.A comment proposed that the requirement of submission within 45 calendardays of Forms 994 showing the issuance of bonds under the bonding linebe broadened to include other required forms. In response, SBA has broadenedthe requirement to ``forms prescribed by SBA'' which will be set forthin SBA's commitment letter. Another comment requested relief for ``pureoversight'' if a surety failed to submit the required forms within 45 daysof issuance of bonds under the bonding line, since such failure voids SBA'sguarantee of the bond from its inception. SBA cannot accept this request,which would render the management of SBA's budget authority unduly precarious.A surety must adopt procedures that will prevent such oversight from lastingeven 45 days. A similar regulation was part of the prior revision, andSection;115.10(e)(2) (1985), and has not produced undue hardships. The differencebetween this final regulation and the earlier version is that the finalversion spells out what SBA requires to reinstate a guarantee in thesecircumstances, SBA invites comment on this provision.Section 115.12(b). Cancellations.A clause has been added to this subsection requiring the cancellation ofthe bonding line upon a default, in the surety's opinion, by the contractoron either a bonded or unbonded contract. The reason for this addition isplain: SBA's commitment to the surety is based on its pre-qualificationof the principal. A default destroys this premise. And thereafter new underwritingdeterminations are necessary.Section 115.13(b). Salvage and recovery.This item has been transferred from former SBA Form 990, with the additionthat SBA may consent to a discontinuance by Surety of its efforts to reduceloss. A further addition provides that a dispute between two or more participatingsureties should be referred to SBA's Central Office for possible resolutionwithout litigation, since most of the cost of such litigation by the partieswould have to be borne by SBA.Section 115.14. Claims for losses. This section has been rewritten in response to the criticism that the word``claim'' in the context of the surety bond guarantee program has two meanings:It covers claims made against a surety by an obligee or other beneficiaryof a bond, as well as claims made by a surety against SBA for reimbursementof losses paid out. The rule now speaks of ``claim for reimbursement onaccount of losses which the surety has paid.''_A comment criticized thevagueness of the clause under which SBA may request ``additional information''before honoring such requests. This vagueness is unavoidable, since SBAcannot foretell in what respects such filings will be deficient. It requiresno argument that SBA cannot make payment on inadequate information; bythe same token, the deadline for SBA's payment must be tolled by the lengthof time that it takes to secure the necessary information._Another commentrequested a time limit within which such requests could be filed. Sucha time limit is not practical, since losses may occur and be paid evenafter the surety has advised SBA to close its file._The regulation nowalso sets up receipt by SBA, rather than the ``time of filing,'' as thebeginning of the 90-day period for payment. The reason for this changeis the ambiguity of the term ``time of filing.''_Former SBA form 990, inandpara;9 of Part II, set up a ``deductible'' of the lesser of $500 or thegross premium. This ``deductible'' has been abolished. SBA's experienceshows that this requirement creates accounting problems for SBA and participatingsureties which are disproportionate to the savings effected, in view ofthe insignificant number of claims or reimburements below this threshold._Thereporting requirement (Art. IX of the Guarantee Agreement in the NPRM)has been transferred to this section, and reduced to a semi-annual statusreport. SBA invites comments on this provision. Section 115.15. Defenses of SBA. Three comments expressed concern with the provision equating with a misstatementby the surety the adoption by the surety of a misstatement which, withdue diligence, surety should have known to be false. In response, SBA hasadded generally accepted underwriting standards as the test whether ornot the surety was justified in adopting a misstatement by a third party.SBA cannot go beyond this general rule, since the variety of errors ofcommission and omission is infinite, and prudent underwriting must adaptthe general rule to the particular facts of a file. One commenter suggestedthat SBA review the sureties' questionnaires for adequacy of disclosure.SBA does not believe that any form can solve all underwriting problemsautomatically; the prudent underwriter will develop his own questions ona case-by-case basis. The same comment suggested that the ``red flags''listed in SOP 50 45 (p. 49) be the test of diligent underwriting. These``red flags'' are merely examples; the SOP stresses that the surety must``adhere to the surety industry's general principles and practices usedin evaluating the credit, capacity and character of a principal, takinginto consideration the reason an SBA guarantee is needed.''_One commentasked who determines whether the surety ``should have known'' of a misrepresentationby others. This clause is commonly interpreted in the law to preclude awillful ignorance, or ignorance resulting from negligence._A comment pointedout that ``statement of personal history forms'' are only required fromthe holders of equity positions in the surety of 20% or more, while thissection requires disclosures of equity positions in a contractor by ownersof 10% or more. In response, SBA has raised the disclosure threshold to20%._SBA has also revised subsection (a), excess contract amount, to providethat the contract amount may not exceed the statutory limit at the timeof issuance of the executed bond, instead of the proposed ``time of executionof the guarantee.'' The reason therefore is stated in the comment on thedefinition of ``Amount of Contract'' under andSection;115.4, <T3>supra.</T3>_A comment also emphasized the difficulty for a major suretycompany to monitor all its officers, directors or partners for a possibleinterest in the contractor to be bonded. In response, SBA has limited thisrequirement to persons empowered to act for the surety, in conformity withthe statutory definition of surety, 15 U.S.C. 694a(4)._A commenter askedwho in SBA would make the decision to deny liability on the grounds ofexcessive contract amount or misrepresentation. Denials of liability underall SBA financial programs are made by the Administrator of SBA personally,as the final agency decision. Recourse from these decisions can only besought in the courts. Section 134.3(i) of this Chapter confers authorityon the Office of Hearings and Appeals to hear only cases of terminationof participation in the surety bond program, and not also denials of liability._Anew subsection (c) transfers to the regulation from former SBA Form 990the exoneration of SBA from liability if surety agrees to a material alterationof the bonded contract or the contract bond, without obtaining prior writtenapproval from SBA (excepting change orders not exceeding 25% or $50,000of the contract amount or bond liability in the aggregate). The former20% limit on change orders is raised to conform to the Federal AcquisitionRegulation, 48 CFR Ch. I, 28.106-5(a)(2)(ii).Section 115.16(a). Improper SBG practice. A comment proposed, and SBA agrees, that the phrase ``other sanctions''was unnecessarily imprecise, when the only sanction intended is the renegotiationof the loss percentage. The rule now so states. This comment also rightlycriticized the use of ``penalized'' instead of ``sanctioned.'' The rulenow avoids the former word._Another comment criticized the term ``unacceptableunderwriting and/or claims practice'' as vague and ambiguous. The rulenow omits this term as unnecessary, because the same subsection establishesthe standard for acceptable practices: Underwriting or claims practicesmust meet industry standards, as compared to other sureties participatingin the program, including standards and practices established and communicatedby SBA to program participants from time to time.Section 115.16(b). Business integrity. This regulation has been expanded to include the requirements, previouslyproposed to be included in the proposed SBA Forms 1427 and 1428, that thecontrolling persons of a Surety must also meet the business integrity qualificationsrequired of the Surety and its agents._A comment pointed out correctlythat the denial of a surety bonding license by a regulator to a first timeapplicant need not have serious cause. Such denial may occur, for example,because the applicant's latest examination by its home state is not recentenough. Accordingly, SBA has dropped such denial from the list of eventstriggering proceedings to deny, suspend or revoke the right to participatein the SBG program. The same comment asked whether upon the lifting ofa suspension by the licensing authority a participant could be readmitted.This is SBA's intent, and is made clear in the final rule. Similarly, anindictment may or may not trigger a suspension, depending on the relevanceof the charges to the participant's fitness to participate in the program,always in a proceeding pursuant to Part 134 of the regulations. Accordingly,this subsection has been rewritten in its entirety._The final rule alsogives the Administrator the right to suspend a surety, pending a hearingand decision under Part 134, for any of the causes listed in subsection(b)._In response to a comment, the final rule makes clear that a bond guaranteeissued by SBA before a suspension or termination remains in effect.Section 115.17(a). Audit. Several comments claimed that access for SBA auditors to surety attorneysand their files might operate as a waiver of the attorney-client privilege,leading possibly to compulsory disclosure to the adversary in a law suit.SBA points out that this provision has been in its regulation since September17, 1981 (46 FR 46113), without any such adverse consequence. At the timeSBA pointed out that it had such authority under its legislation, as wellas the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5 U.S.C. App. 1)._One comment alsoquestioned a Surety's power to make available to SBA auditors the recordsof the completion contractor. Since SBA is sharing in the completion cost,it is a legitimate requirement that both the surety and its guarantor (SBA)should have access to the relevant records.Section 115.17(e). Cost principles (omitted) The proposed introduction of the cost principles of the federal procurementregulations (Federal Acquisition Regulations_``FAR'') into the claims auditingprocess was condemned by all three applicable comments. It was pointedout that the government procurement regulations bear no rational relationshipto the surety business, because the government is not acquiring, procuringor buying anything. It was also stressed that these regulations provideno useful guidelines to the determination of professional fees or completioncosts on a bond claim. The inclusion of such a provision would make claimshandling unduly complicated, bureaucratic and burdensome. A comment questionedparticularly the application of federal rules to non-federal projects.In response, SBA has omitted the reference in the final rule, leaving SBAauditors free to apply whatever cost principles are appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="84">Appendix A._Surety Bond Agreements </ITAG>Instead of the proposed two separate and quite lengthy Surety bond guaranteeagreements (proposed Forms 1427 and 1428), SBA has decided to use one shortform, SBA Form 990. The front of this form will resemble Part I of formerForm 990 quite closely, and will contain all the information required toidentify the contract, the surety, the principal, etc. The reverse sideof this form is reproduced below as Appendix A. Compliance With Executive Order 12291 and the Regulatory Flexibility ActSBA considers this revision of the Surety Bond Guarantee (SBG) regulations,taken as a whole, to be both a major rule for the purposes of ExecutiveOrder 12291, and a rule which will, for the purposes of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act, have a significant economic impact on a substantial numberof small entities. Therefore, we offer the following Regulatory Impact/RegulatoryFlexibility Analysis for the purpose of compliance with the pertinent requirementsof these two measures. 1. <T3>Description of the potential benefits of the rule. </T3>This revisionwill provide SBA, the surety companies participating in its SBA program,and the small contractors seeking surety bonds with SBA's guarantee fromparticipating sureties, with clearer guidance as to how SBA guaranteesare obtained, who may apply and/or qualify for such guarantees and whois not eligible, and how both sureties and contractors may continue tobenefit from the SBG program. We believe that the revision will benefitSBA since it will clarify the regulatory framework with considerable inputfrom the public, following two earlier publications seeking such comments.As pointed out above, the program will be made available with fixed premiumshares. Moreover, the discontinuance of premium regulation, coupled withthe loss guarantee percentage not to exceed 80%, should enable more contractorsto obtain SBA guaranteed bonds, because more surety companies will participatewith SBA, and our budget authority will cover a greater number of bonds.The repeal of the ``deductible'' (andSection; 115.14), together with thepermitted increase in contract price from 20% to 25% (up to an increaseof $50,000) without SBA approval permitted by andSection; 115.15(c), shouldcombine to reduce the paperwork involved, and give greater leeway to suretiesand their clients. 2. <T3>Description of potential costs of the rule. </T3>Contractors may experiencea rise in their bonding cost, due to the lifting by SBA of the cap on thepremium, but it is SBA's expectation that the deregulation of premiumswill increase bond availability while the former cap had a depressing effecton such availability. 3. <T3>Description of the net benefits of this revision. </T3>This revisionshould provide for an expansion of the SBG program within SBA's budgetauthority. 4. <T3>Description of reasons why this action is taken. </T3>This revisionis made with considerable public participation, to reflect both SBA's experiencesince the prior revision, and the comments received in the course of thisrevision. Simplification of procedures is expected to attract more suretiesto the SBG program, and thus provide required bonds to more small businessmen.5. <T3>Statement of objectives and legal basis for this final revision. </T3>Thepurpose of this revision of the SBG rules is to simplify the paperwork,to facilitate the issuance of more bond quarantees to sureties for theirsmall business clients, and to increase the scope of SBA's budget authority.The legal basis of this revision is section 411(d) of the Small BusinessInvestment Act, 15 U.S.C. 694b(d). 6. <T3>Description of entities to which final rule will apply. </T3>This revisionwill apply to surety companies seeking guarantees from SBA for their smallbusiness surety bonds, and will also affect indirectly the small businessclients of such sureties requiring SBA guarantees because of their inabilityto obtain bonds without such guarantees. 7. <T3>Description of the reporting, recordkeeping and compliance requirementsof the revision. </T3>On balance, this revision will impose fewer reportingand recordkeeping requirements on sureties, than did the prior revision.8. <T3>Federal rules. </T3>There are no relevant Federal rules which duplicateor overlap this revision. 9. <T3>Analysis of public participation. </T3>A detailed analysis of the publiccomments received in response to the proposed revision, and of SBA's effortsto conform this revision to these comments, has been provided above. Anequally detailed analysis of the comments received in response to the advancenotice of proposed rule making was furnished with the Notice of ProposedRule Making on August 21, 1985 (50 FR 33766). SBA submits that it has rejected no alternative to this revision whichwould minimize the economic impact of this rule on small entities withoutgiving its reason therefor. In this regard, the regulations affect primarilyparticipating sureties, which are not necessarily small entities, whilethey benefit primarily small contractors, with whom SBA has not directrelationship under this program. In preparing this revision, we have sought,for the sake of continuity, to adhere closely to the prior regulatory framework in establishing participation requirements for this program. We donot believe that any of the rejected alternatives would have more consistentlyaccomplished the stated objectives of our statute than those which we haveadopted. These regulations contain no reporting requirements which have not beenapproved by the Office of Management and Budget under the Paperwork ReductionAct, 44 U.S.C. Ch. 35. Such approval is noted in each appropriate place.While this rule is final, effective sixty days from publication, commentsare nevertheless invited and will be considered for possible amendmentof this revision. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 13 CFR Part 115 </ITAG>Small businesses, Surety bonds.Pursuant to the authority contained in section 411(d) of Title IV, PartB, Small Business Investment Act of 1958, as amended [15 U.S.C. 694b(d)],Title 13, Code of Federal Regulations, Chapter I, Part 115, is hereby revisedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 115_SURETY BOND GUARANTEE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Secs.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.1 Statutory provisions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.2 Headings.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.3 Policy.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.4 Definitions.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.5 Eligibility of principal.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.6 Procedure for surety bond guarantee assistance.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.7 Approval or decline of Surety's application.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.8 Underwriting standards.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.9 SBA's review of Surety's underwriting.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.10 Reinstatement for underwriting purposes.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.11 Fees and premiums.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.12 Surety bonding line.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.13 Minimization of loss.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.14 Claims for losses.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.15 Defenses of SBA.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.16 Refusal to issue further guarantees.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.17 Audit and investigation.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">115.18 Savings clause.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix A_Surety Bond Guarantee Agreement  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Appendix B_Underwriting Considerations.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> Title IV, Part B of the Small Business Investment Actof 1958 (15 U.S.C. 694a, 694b) and the Inspector General Act of 1978 (5U.S.C.

It is the intent of Congress to strengthenthe competitive free enterprise system by assisting qualified small businessconcerns to obtain on a prudent and economically justifiable basis bid,payment, or performance bonds which are otherwise unobtainable withouta Small Business Administration (SBA) guarantee. Consequently, Congresshas authorized SBA to guarantee (upon such terms and conditions as SBAmay prescribe) sureties participating in the Surety Bond Guarantee (SBG)program up to 90 percent of the losses incurred as a result of a principal'sbreach of the terms of a bid bond, payment bond, performance bond, or bondswhich are ancillary to and coterminous with such bonds, on any contractnot exceeding $1,250,000 in face value.  (b) <T3>Types of bonds</T3>. The Administration has determined that only bid,performance, and payment bonds (other than bonds in the nature of a financialguarantee) issued in connection with a contract and of a type listed inthe ``Contract Bonds'' section of the current Rating Manual of the SuretyAssociation of America \1\<NOTE/> will be eligible for an SBA guarantee. In addition, the SBAguarantee may be extended to such coterminous ``ancillary'' bonds as areincidential to the Contract and essential for its performance.

(c) <T3>Guarantee agreement.</T3> A surety company participating in this programshall be listed by the U.S. Treasury as eligible to issue bonds in connectionwith Federal procurement contracts, or a corporation determined by SBAto be a surety eligible to participate in this program. The terms and conditionsof SBA's bond guarantee agreements may vary from surety to surety, dependingon SBA's experience with a particular surety. In determining the divisionof losses, the Office of Surety Guarantees will consider, among other things,surety's loss rate in this program in comparision to other sureties participatingwith SBA to a comparable degree, the rating or ranking designation assignedto the surety by recognized authority, the average dollar amount of bondpenalty per bond written in this program and the ratio of bid bonds tofinal bonds written in this program. SBA shall not guarantee more than80% of losses as defined herein.

A guarantee issued by SBA, whether pursuant to a suretybonding line (see andSection;115.12) or otherwise (see andSection;115.7(a))will be honored only if issued (as that term is defined in andSection;115.4)before the executed bonds and before the work under the contract has actuallybegun. An SBA official having delegated authority to approve the bond inquestion may consent, but only by a separate writing, to the guaranteeof a bond or bonds to be issued after work under the contract has actuallybegun, upon receipt of all of the following from the Surety:(1) Evidence (certified copy of contract or sworn affidavit) from the principalthat the surety bond requirement was contained in the original job contract,or documentation satisfactory to SBA, as to why a surety bond was not previouslysecured and is now being required.(2) A certification by the principal listing all suppliers and indicatingthat they are paid to date, attaching a waiver of lien from each; thatall taxes and labor costs are current; that all subcontractors are paidto their current position of work and a waiver of lien from each, or anexplanation satisfactory to SBA why such documentation cannot be produced.(3) A certification by obligee that all payments due under the contractto present status have been made and that the job has been satisfactorilycompleted to present status.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 115.4</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions.</ITAG>This section includes terms defined at 15 U.S.C. 694a and provides definitionsof other terms.<T3>``Affiliate'' </T3>is defined in andSection; 121.3(a) of this Chapter.<T3>``Amount of Contract.'' </T3>The amount of the contract to be bondedshall be established as of the later time of (a) issuance of the executedand guaranteed bond or bonds or (b) award of the bonded contract to theprincipal.

The contract shall notbe a permit, subdivision contract, lease, land contract, evidence of debt,financial guarantee, warranty of performance or efficiency, warranty offidelity, or release of lien (other than for claims under a guaranteedbond) nor shall a contract prohibit a surety from performing a contractupon default of the principal. A warranty in excess of two years or forother than materials or workmanship shall not be covered by SBA's guarantyunless SBA, by a separate writing signed by surety and SBA, agrees to awarranty in excess of two years from completion, ancillary to an otherwiseeligible contract, limited to materials and workmanship, if such warrantyis the immediate contractual responsibility of the principal, upon a showingthat such warranty is customarily required in the relevant trade or industry.<T3>``Contractor'' </T3>means the person with whom the obligee has contractedto perform the contract.<T3>``Issuance'' </T3>or <T3>``issued'' </T3>means the release of the SBA-guaranteed executed bondby the surety, which binds surety to the contract if such contract is awardedto the principal.<T3>``Loss'' </T3>shall have the following meanings:(a) Loss Under Bid Bond.

Amounts actually paid, specifically allocableto the investigation, adjustment, negotiation, compromise, settlement ofor resistance to a given claim (including court costs and reasonable attorney'sfees) for loss resulting from the asserted breach of the terms of any guaranteedbond, but excluding all unallocated or overhead expenses of Surety. Anyallocation method must be reasonable and in accord with generally acceptedaccounting principles.(e) Loss From Litigation Cost. Expenses shall also include court costsand reasonable attorney's fees incurred in suits to enforce mitigationof loss as defined in paragraphs (a) through (c) of this definition, includingsuits to obtain sums due from obligees, indemnitors, principals and others,but no such expense shall be paid for any such suits filed against theUnited States of America or any of its agencies, officers or employeesunless the surety has, prior to filing such suit, received written concurrencefrom SBA that such suit may be filed, or unless such claim is assertedas a cross-claim or counterclaim.(f) Loss From Attorneys' Fees and Damages. ``Loss'' shall not include attorney'sfees and court costs incurred by a surety in a suit by or against SBA orits Administrator, and shall not include such costs or payments (<T3>e.g.</T3>, tort damages) arising out of a successful suit soundingin tort initiated under the bond by a principal or any other person againstsuch surety.(g) Loss After Excess Contract Amount. Where the contract amount, throughchange orders or otherwise, within the limits permitted by andSection; 115.15(c),is increased after Issuance of the executed guaranteed bond beyond thestatutory limit of $1,250,000, SBA's share of the loss shall be limitedto that percentage of the increased contract amount, which the statutorylimit represents, multiplied by the guarantee percentage approved by SBApursuant to andSection; 115.3(c).

Application for an SBA guarantee (includinga bonding line application) is made by the contractor and the surety onthe SBA Application for Surety Bond Guarantee Assistance, SBA Forms 994and 994B (Underwriting Review), respectively (OMB Approval No. 32450007).Except for premiums, contractor shall itemize on SBA Form 994 (Applicationfor Surety Bond Assistance) all payments made, or to be made, by contractorto surety (as defined in andSection; 115.4) for whatever purpose as a conditionof, or in connection with, the issuance of the bond(s) to be guaranteedby SBA.
