Richard G. Lugar, head of the Americandelegation, said of the Friday meeting with Kohl.   Asked whether he thought the West Germans were committed tostaying in the NATO military alliance of Western nations, theIndiana Republican said: ``Without any reservations.''   There is growing discussion in West Germany about Germanreunification as a result of sweeping social and political reformsunderway in East Germany. There has been speculation that WestGermany might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if theKremlin stipulates it as the price for reunification.   Kohl on Tuesday unveiled a 10-point proposal with Germanreunification as its ultimate goal. But the Soviets, who sufferedmillions of deaths fighting a unified Germany in World War II, havesaid the idea of German reunification is ``dangerous andunrealistic.''   President Bush and Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev are tobegin a shipboard summit off Malta on Saturday. The dramatic eventsin East Germany and whirlwind reforms elsewhere in the East blocare likely to be a main topic of their talks.   Lugar came to Bonn with eight other members of the U.S. Senate'sarms control observer group. He said the purpose of the trip was to``visit with the Germans on their judgments about all of theseprocedures that are going on.''   U.S. Ambassador Vernon A. Walters joined the senators for their75-minute closed-door talks with Kohl. The senators also met withForeign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Defense MinisterGerhard Stoltenberg during the day.   Lugar said Kohl told the Americans that reunification would be a``procedure that depends on many events in Germany and Europe'' andthat the Soviet Union and the United States have a role to play.   Lugar said of Kohl's proposals, ``There is much to work withthere with regard to the future of Germany and the future of the(NATO) alliance.''</TEXT></DOC>
