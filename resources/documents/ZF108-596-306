 Unlikehardware, which continues to improve in price/performance, software costscontinue to increase at an increasing rate, both directly and indirectly.andO;According to Stamford, Conn.-based Gartner Group, &quot;The expected contributionof software to IBM's revenue stream will mandate software increases of 10 percent to 15 per cent annually ...&quot;andM;This estimate does not take into consideration any indirect increases insoftware fees due, for example, to a processor upgrade or reclassification,in which case the one-time upgrade fees and incremental monthly or annualcharges are often significant, and may increase the estimate to in excess of20 to 30 per cent.andM;* The number and complexity of pricing models under which software and, morerecently, associated support are licensed continues to increase: even withina specific pricing model (e.g.andP;  graduated pricing), there is no standardimplementation among vendors, which further complicates the situation forcustomers.andP;  With the restrictive nature of current and anticipated pricingmodels, as compared to a site licence model, customers' financial and legalliabilities may be increased, as in the situation where notification to avendor of a processor upgrade is inadvertently overlooked, or an applicationis relocated by technical or operational staff to a different, largerprocessor.andM;The resulting impact and cost to both the customer and the vendor inadministering software licences can, particularly for large customers, besignificant, especially during a processor upgrade.andP;  Furthermore, manyvendors' billing systems are antiquated and unable to handle alternatepricing models; as a result, invoices are often incorrect and may not reflectany negotiated terms.andM;Note that the introduction of client-server architectures and correspondingproducts will introduce additional complexity into product licensing andpricing issues.andM;* Customers are spending an increasing amount of time and effort negotiating,revising and defending contracts, with increasing vendoropposition/inflexibility.andP;  This is in part due to the fact that, in general,the vendor's contract forms the basis for the terms and negotiations, and thecustomer has to invest time in reviewing, interpreting and revising thevendor's terms, at considerable expense.andP;  In other cases, customers have hadto invest a significant amount of time in defending existing contracts towhich vendors have attempted to retrofit new terms (e.g.andP;  graduated pricing,billable support), as is often the case when a product is acquired by anothercompany which has different terms.andM;While the effort and expense to defend existing contract terms may besignificant, it is often justified, not only due to the direct benefitsresulting from protection of specific favorable terms, but due to theprecedent that is set which may further protect the customer from futureaction or contract interpretation by the vendor.andM;* With the trend away from site licensing and towards CPU-based licences,customers' ability to (dynamically) balance or relocate workload amongprocessors may be impacted, due to licensing restrictions and, in some cases,CPU serial number dependencies.andP;  As a result, it may be difficult tooptimally meet capacity requirements without incurring the additional expenseof infrequently used 'spare' software licences and/or processor capacity.andP;  Inaddition, operational and management procedures may have to be modified toensure that software products are used only on those processors for which alicence is in effect; otherwise, the company may incur financial and legalliabilities.andM;* Industry consolidation through acquisitions and resulting problems; forexample, the acquiring vendor's position on and commitment to: productstrategies and plans; product quality, maintenance and enhancements; productsupport levels and availability; product fees (e.g.andP;  renewal fees); and,adherence to original contract terms, as compared to those of the originalvendor and customer expectations set by that vendor.andP;  Industry consolidationalso results in reduced vendor and, possibly, product alternatives.andP;  However,in theory, there should be greater opportunities for leveraged negotiationsand product integration.andM;* Increasing vendor control of the customer accounts and customer dependencyon vendors through, for example, more restrictive contract terms, (physical)software dependencies such as CPU serial number or class, industryconsolidation and 'business partner' marketing strategies.andP;  The implicationsof such control and dependency may not be evident, especially in the shortterm; however, customer flexibility and independence may be adverselyaffected to a degree that may offset any advantages, and may severely affectthe customer's ability to service its business.andM;* Increasing popularity of multi-vendor solutions, vendor alliances andproduct interdependencies, and the inherent complexity and risks associatedwith such arrangements (e.g.andP;  Value-Added Reseller (VAR), systems integrator,vendor business partners).andP;  Additional caution and effort is required inthese situations to ensure the customer is adequately protected, and one ormore of the involved vendors is responsible for delivery and support of 'thesystem' and liable in the event of non-delivery or inadequate support.andM;* Many customers have experienced an unacceptable level of incomplete,ineffective and/or redundant software implementations and, correspondingly,reduced or unrealized benefits.andP;  Compounded with the often arbitrary natureof expenses for installed software such as upgrade fees, over which softwaremanagers have little control and for which the company may not derive anyadditional return, executive management may become overly cautious inconsidering software proposals.andP;  Non-approval, however, may result in amissed opportunity for the company, with significant benefits (assuming asuccessful and complete implementation).andM;An effective Software Asset Management program will potentially meet a numberof objectives and provide corresponding tangible and intangible benefits,including:andM;* reduced software expense (i.e.andP;  fees) and related administrative andsupport costs;andM;* increased control over software assets, and reduced exposure of the systemsand business functions that are dependent on same;andM;* increased flexibility with respect to software operation and use;andM;* improved planning and implementation, with increased ability to realizeanticipated net benefits;andM;* increased awareness of industry trends, issues and ramifications of same;and,andM;* appropriate and consistent response to and management of vendors and theissues.andM;Sherry Irwin is a senior consultant with The Transition Group, a managementconsulting firm based in Toronto and the exclusive Canadian agent for theGartner Group's Research Advisory and Strategic Planning Services.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
