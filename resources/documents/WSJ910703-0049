Word leaked on Madison Avenue that American Isuzu Motorshad selected five small agencies with enviable creativereputations to compete for its $75 million to $90 millionaccount. The agencies include Goodby, Berlin andamp; Silverstein,San Francisco; McCabe andamp; Co. and AltschillerReitzfeld/Tracy-Locke, both of New York; and two Minneapolisagencies, McElligott Wright Morrison White, and CarmichaelLynch.</LP><TEXT>   The news surprised some industry observers, who noted thatmost car makers' accounts are serviced at big ad agenciesthat are perhaps better suited to the complex day-to-dayhandling of car accounts. But Subaru bucked convention whenit tapped Wieden andamp; Kennedy, a small but creative agency bestknown for its &quot;Bo knows&quot; Nike ads. Industry executives saidIsuzu, too, may be looking to distinguish itself with risky,offbeat ads.   &quot;I think that American Isuzu is playing follow theleader,&quot; said Alice Magdol-Conrad, of ad agency headhuntersMagdol andamp; McCone. &quot;The feeling here might be that incompetitive times you have to take a gamble. I can guaranteeyou that Isuzu wouldn't have made this decision withoutSubaru's move first.&quot;   But Ms. Magdol-Conrad and other industry executives warnedthat these smaller agencies might not be equipped to servicethe giant accounts. &quot;There's a real question as to whether{these agencies} can maintain their same character, or ifthey will be able to handle the business at all. This is morethan just getting out a Nike ad.&quot;   Car accounts are far larger than the clients most smallagencies are accustomed to handling, and small shops don'troutinely run accounts in the $100 million range. Most caradvertising also involves tie-ins with local car dealers allaround that country, requiring an up-and-running network thatmost small agencies don't have. And the sheer number ofcommercials and variations requires intensive manpower.   Wieden andamp; Kennedy apparently satisfied Subaru that it iscapable of handling the business. After being awarded thecreative portion of the account, it later convinced Subaru tolet the firm handle the media buying, too. The shop, based inPortland, Ore., set up a service office in Mount Laurel,N.J., near Subaru's U.S. headquarters in Cherry Hill, N.J.   The only other major Japanese car maker that has itsaccount serviced at a small agency is Honda, whose ads arecreated at Rubin Postaer andamp; Associates in Los Angeles. Omon, asmall agency in New York, does handle Toyota's smallcorporate-image account, but the majority of Toyota'sadvertising work is handled by Saatchi andamp; Saatchi.   Isuzu, a unit of Isuzu Motors Ltd. of Japan, wouldn'tconfirm the names on the list or say what affected itsdecision to hear pitches only from smaller shops. Aspokeswoman said only that a list of the finalists wouldlikely be released today.   To be sure, one reason Isuzu may have narrowed itsselection to five small shops is that most big agenciesalready have a car account. Its previous agency, Eurocom'sDella Femina McNamee, is much bigger than any in the quintetit will now consider. That shop created the well-knowncommercials featuring &quot;Joe Isuzu,&quot; the lying car salesman.Isuzu, which has been posting sluggish sales at best, firedDella Femina in May and assigned media-buying duties to SFMMedia Corp. in New York; the small shop that wins the Isuzuaccount will oversee only the creative portion.   The Isuzu contenders prefer to suggest it was theircreative firepower that wooed the Japanese auto maker. Theexecutives said Isuzu's decision to look at hot shops may bea reflection of today's auto market: U.S. car makers are nowcompeting head on with the Japanese car companies' long-heldclaims of superior value and reliability.   &quot;I think Wieden broke it wide open for agencies out in thehinterland, where a lot of cars are sold,&quot; said Lee Lynch,chairman and chief executive officer at Carmichael Lynch.&quot;They broke the myth that car accounts have to be based inNew York or Los Angeles.&quot; His agency, with billings of about$100 million, is one of the biggest being considered; others,including McElligott Wright and McCabe, are brand new shopsrun by legendary admen that each have only a few smallaccounts.   Goodby Berlin, with billings of about $120 million, hasbeen on a hot streak lately, winning Heublein and the Carl'sJr. account from Carl Karcher Enterprises. But Goodby mayhave a conflict in its Northern California Honda DealersAssociation account; agency executives couldn't be reached tofind out how that could be resolved.   Regardless, the small agencies are gearing up for whatwill be a relatively quick review process. Isuzu has told theshops that they will receive a briefing outlining anadvertising project within the next week, and that finalpresentations will be made in the last week of July. &quot;We sentout a fun internal memo to our employees about us beingincluded in the review,&quot; Mr. Lynch said. &quot;The note was signedby Joe Isuzu and included all kinds of lies, like that theaccount is $300 million and that it's already down to twoagencies.&quot;   ---   Ayer Promotes Three                                                                                                          Ayer promoted three top executives, consolidating thenumber of executives reporting to the chairman of the agency,Jerry J. Siano.   Thomas F. Maxey, the agency's 54-year-old vice chairman,was named to the additional post of chief operating officer.Dominick F. Rossi Jr., 50, who had been president of theagency's flagship New York office, was promoted to presidentof Ayer's U.S. operations. Patrick J.

Corlett, 47,chief financial officer; David Gantman, 49, managing directorof account services; and Richard Hedger, 53, chairman ofAyer's European operations, will report to Mr. Maxey.
