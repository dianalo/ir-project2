Since 1983, a rule of procedure for lawsuits in federalcourt has empowered federal judges to levy &quot;sanctions&quot;against those who file lawsuits that are unfounded. The fineis imposed on the principle that by signing legal documents,lawyers and parties to lawsuits assure the court that thelawsuit or document is &quot;well grounded&quot; as to the facts andthe law. Proposed by the Supreme Court and accepted byCongress, the rule was intended to slow the explosion oflawsuits in federal courts.</LP><TEXT>   Judges have imposed fines in several thousand cases since1983, mostly against lawyers. Federal courts have beenreluctant to fine clients who are represented by lawyers onthe theory that the rules of court procedure are principallyintended to regulate the conduct of lawyers.   Yesterday, in a 5-4 decision, the high court said thatwhen clients sign documents in a lawsuit, they may be subjectto fines, even though they are represented by lawyers.   It is unusual for clients to sign the actual complaintinitiating the lawsuit. The dissenting opinion, written byJustice Anthony Kennedy, said there are few circumstances inwhich clients, rather than their lawyers, must sign courtpapers.   But Geoffrey Hazard, a Yale Law School professor andexpert in court procedure and lawyers' ethics, said the ruleapplies to any court papers that are signed, includingaffidavits or sworn statements. He said it is common forclients, including many executives of businesses, to fileaffidavits with lawsuits that outline relevant facts.   There was other disagreement about the scope of theruling. Paul Levy, a lawyer with the consumer-oriented PublicCitizen Litigation Group, questioned whether clients who signan affidavit on an aspect of a case will be held responsiblefor the entire case.   The court's majority opinion, written by Justice SandraO'Connor, rejected arguments that clients be held to a lesserstandard than lawyers and said the same legal standardapplies to anyone who signs a document. Before signing, alawyer or party must make a &quot;reasonable&quot; effort, measuredobjectively, to determine that the document isn't false ormisleading, the court said.   Justice Kennedy's dissenting opinion, joined by JusticesThurgood Marshall, John Stevens and Antonin Scalia, said thecourt was imposing &quot;chilling liability&quot; on clients who can'tbe expected to know the contents of court rules.   Professor Hazard, however, praised the ruling. &quot;It's avery important decision because it eliminates this game theycan play,&quot; he said. &quot;The lawyer thinks he's able to saysomething in a document because it's the client'sinformation, and the client thinks it's OK because the lawyertold him to sign it,&quot; he said. &quot;This decision will have asignificant deterrent effect.&quot;   The decision was a victory for Chromatic CommunicationsEnterprises Inc., a small computer publisher operated from agarage in Walnut Creek, Calif. Chromatic was sued in 1986 byBusiness Guides Inc., a division of New York-basedLebhar-Friedman Inc. The suit alleged that Chromatic copiedinformation from Business Guides for a competing directory ofcomputer firms; Business Guides said it detected this byplanting incorrect information in its directory.   A federal judge in San Francisco ruled that most ofBusiness Guides' planted information wasn't incorrect andthat the company signed the request for an injunction andaffidavits without checking the allegations. The judge finedBusiness Guides $13,865, and a federal appeals court in SanFrancisco upheld the sanction. The Supreme Court affirmed theappeals court ruling yesterday.

The American Postal Workers Union and other unionssued in 1987, arguing that the rule, which allowed privatecompanies to deliver mail to postal services of othercountries, wasn't in the &quot;public interest.&quot; A federal judgeupheld the Postal Service action. But in 1989, a federalappeals court in the District of Columbia said that the rulewas improperly adopted. Yesterday, in an opinion written byChief Justice William Rehnquist, the high court dismissed thelawsuit, saying the unions lack a legal basis to challengethe rule.
