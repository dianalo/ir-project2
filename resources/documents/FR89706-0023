It states that OPM ``will adopt the Architectural and TransportationBarriers Compliance Board's (ATBCB) `Minimum Guidelines and Requirementsfor Accessible Design' when they are issued in final form.'' The rule suggeststhat in the interim, new construction or alteration be in conformance withthe ``American National Standard Specifications for Making Buildings andFacilities Accessible to, and Usable by, the Physically Handicapped'' publishedby the American National Standards Institute (ANSI A117.1-1961 (R1971)).As detailed below, the ATBCB issued its guidelines in 1982. The proposedrevision set forth in this document will reference UFAS, which is consistentwith the ATBCB's guidelines.On August 7, 1984, UFAS was issued by the four agencies establishing standardsunder the Architectural Barriers Act [49 FR 31528 (see discussion <T3>infra</T3>)]. The Department of Justice (DOJ), as the agency responsibleunder Executive Order 12250 for coordinating the enforcement of section504, has recommended that agencies amend their section 504 regulationsfor federally assisted programs or activities to establish that, with respectto new construction and alterations, compliance with UFAS shall be deemedto be compliance with section 504. Because some facilities subject to newconstruction or alteration requirements under section 504 are also subjectto the Architectural Barriers Act, governmentwide reference to UFAS willdiminish the possibility that recipients of Federal financial assistancewould face conflicting enforcement standards. In addition, reference toUFAS by all Federal funding agencies will reduce potential conflicts whena building is subject to the section 504 regulations of more than one Federalagency.<ITAG tagnum="84">Background of Accessibility Standards</ITAG>The Architectural Barriers Act of 1968, 42 U.S.C. 4151-4157, requires certainFederal and federally funded buildings to be designed, constructed, andaltered in accordance with accessibility standards. It also designatesfour agencies (the General Services Administration, the Departments ofDefense and Housing and Urban Development, and the U.S. Postal Service)to prescribe the accessibility standards. Section 502 of the RehabilitationAct of 1973 established the ATBCB. In 1978 the Rehabilitation Act was amendedto require the ATBCB, <T3>inter alia,</T3> to issue minimum guidelines and requirements for thestandards to be issued by the four standard-setting agencies. The minimumguidelines were published on August 4, 1982 (47 FR 33862), and are codifiedat 36 CFR Part 1190.\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The ATBCB Office of Technical Services is available toprovide technical assistance to recipients upon request relating to theelimination of architectural barriers. Its address is: U.S. ATBCB, Officeof Technical Services, 1111 18th Street, NW., Suite 500, Washington, DC20036. The telephone number is (202) 653-7834 [voice/TDD]. this is nota toll fee number.On August 7, 1984, the four standard-setting agencies issued UFAS as aneffort to minimize the differences among the four agencies' Barriers Actstandards, and among those standards and accessibility standards used bythe private sector. The General Services Administration (GSA) and Departmentof Housing and Urban Development (HUD) have incorporated UFAS into theirBarriers Act regulations (<T3>see</T3> 41 CFR Subpart 101-19.6 (GSA) and 24 CFR Part 40 (HUD)). Inorder to ensure uniformity, UFAS was designed to be consistent with thescoping and technical provisions of the ATBCB's minimum guidelines andrequirements, as well as with the technical provisions of ANSI A117.1-1980,published by the American National Standards Institute. (The 1980 ANSIstandard contains fee scoping provisions.) ANSI is a private, nationalorganization that publishes recommended standards on a wide variety ofsubjects. ANSI's original accessibility standard, ANSI A117.1, ``Specificationsfor Making Buildings and Facilities Accessible to, and Usable by, PhysicallyHandicapped People,'' was published in 1961 and reaffirmed in 1971. Thecurrent edition, issued in 1986, is ANSI A117.1-1986. The 1961, 1980, and1986 ANSI standards are frequently used in private practice and by Stateand local governments.This proposed amendment would amend the current regulation implementingsection 504 in programs or activities receiving Federal financial assitancefrom OPM to refer to UFAS.The agency has determined that it will not require the use of UFAS, orany other standard, as the sole means by which recipients can achieve compliancewith the requirement that new construction and alterations be accessible.To do so would unnecessarily restrict recipients' ability to design forparticular circumstances. In addition, it might create conflicts with Stateor local accessibility requirements that may also apply to recipients'buildings and that are intended to achieve ready access and use. It isexpected that in some instances recipients will be able to satisfy thesection 504 new construction and alteration requirements by following applicableState or local codes, and vice versa.<ITAG tagnum="84">Effect of Amendment</ITAG>The agency's current section 504 rule requires that new facilities be designedand constructed to be readily accessible to and usable by persons withhandicaps and that alterations be accessible to the maximum extent feasible.The amendment would not affect the current requirement but would merelyprovide that compliance with UFAS with respect to buildings (as opposedto ``facilities,'' a broader term that encompasses buildings as well asother types of property) shall be deemed compliance with these requirementswith respect to those buildings. Thus, for example, an alteration is accessible``to the maximum extent feasible'' if it is done in accordance with UFAS.It should be noted that UFAS contains special requirements for alterationswhere meeting the general standards would be impracticable or infeasible(<T3>see e.g.,</T3> UFAS sections 4.1.6(1)(b), 4.1.6(3), 4.1.6(4), and 4.1.7).The amendment also includes language providing that departures from particularUFAS technical and scoping requirements are permitted so long as the alternativemethods used will provide substantially equivalent or greater access toand utilization of the building. Allowing these departures from UFAS willprovide recipients with necessary flexibility to design for special circumstancesand will facilitate the application of new technologies that are not specifiedin UFAS. As explained under ``Background of Accessibility Standards,''the agency anticipates that compliance with some provisions of applicableState and local accessibility requirements will provide ``substantiallyequivalent'' access. In some circumstances, recipients may choose to usemethods specified in model building codes or other State or local codesthat are not necessarily applicable to their buildings but that achievesubstantially equivalent access.The amendment requires that the alternative methods provide ``substantially''equivalent or greater access, in order to clarify that the alternativeaccess need not be precisely equivalent to that afforded by UFAS. Applicationof the ``substantially equivalent access'' language will depend on thenature, location, and intended use of a particular building. Generally,alternative methods will satisfy the requirement if in material respectsthe access is substantially equivalent to that which would be providedby UFAS in such respects as safety, convenience, and independence of movement.For example, it would be permissible to depart from the technical requirementof UFAS section 4.10.9 that the inside dimensions of an elevator car beat least 68 inches or 80 inches (depending on the location of the door)on the door opening side, by 54 inches, if the clear floor area and theconfiguration of the car permits wheelchair users to enter the car, makea 360-degree turn, maneuver within reach of controls, and exit from thecar. This departure is permissible because it results in access that issafe, convenient, and independent, and therefore substantially equivalentto that provided by UFAS.With respect to UFAS scoping requirements, it would be permissible in somecircumstances to depart from the UFAS new construction requirement of oneaccessible principal entrance at each grade floor level of a building (seeUFAS section 4.1.2(8)), if safe, convenient, and independent access isprovided to each level of the new facility by a wheelchair user from anaccessible principal entrance. This departure would not be permissibleif it required an individual with handicaps to travel an extremely longdistance to reach the spaces served by the inaccessible entrances or otherwiseprovided access that was substantially less convenient than that whichwould be provided by UFAS.It would not be permissible for a recipient to depart from UFAS' requirementthat, in new construction of a long-term care facility, at least 50% ofall patient bedrooms be accessible (see UFAS section 4.1.4(9)(b)), by usinglarge accessible wards that make it possible for 50% of all beds in thefacility to be accessible to individuals with handicaps. The result isthat the population of individuals with handicaps in the facility willbe concentrated in large wards, while able-bodied persons will be concentratedin smaller, more private rooms. Because convenience for persons with handicapsis therefore compromised to such a great extent, the degree of accessibilityprovided to persons with handicaps is not substantially equivalent to thatintended to be afforded by UFAS.It should be noted that the amendment does not require that existing buildingsleased by recipients meet the standards for new construction and alterations.Rather, it continues the current Federal practice under section 504 oftreating newly leased buildings as subject to the program accessibilitystandard for existing facilities.Buildings under design on the effective date of this amendment will begoverned by the amendment if the date that bids were invited falls laterthe effective date. This interpretation is consistent with GSA's ArchitecturalBarriers Act regulation incorporating UFAS, at 41 CFR Subpart 101-19.6.The proposed revision includes language modifying the effect of UFAS section4.1.6(1)(g), which provides an exception to UFAS section 4.1.6, <T3>Accessible buildings: Alterations.</T3> Section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFASstates that ``mechanical rooms and other spaces which normally are notfrequented by the public or employees of the building or facility or whichby nature of their use are not required by the Architectural Barriers Actto be accessible are excepted from the requirements of 4.1.6.'' Particularlyafter the development of specific UFAS provisions for housing alterationsand additions, UFAS section 4.1.6(1)(g) could be read to exempt alterationsto privately owned residential housing, which is not covered by the ArchitecturalBarriers Act unless leased by the Federal Government for subsidized housingprograms. This exception, however, is not appropriate under section 504,which protects beneficiaries of housing provided as part of a federallyassisted program. Consequently, the proposed amendment provides that, forpurposes of this section, section 4.1.6(1)(g) of UFAS shall be interpretedto exempt from the requirements of UFAS only spaces that, because of theirintended use, will not require accessibility to the public or beneficiaries,or residents or employees with handicaps.The proposed revison also provides that whether or not the recipient optsto follow UFAS in satisfaction of the ready access requirement, the recipientis not required to make building alterations that have little likelihoodof being accomplished without removing or altering a load-bearing structuralmember. This provision does not relieve recipients of their obligationunder the current regulation to ensure program accessibility.This document has been reviewed by DOJ. It is an adaptation of a prototypeprepared by DOJ under Executive Order 12250 of November 2, 1980. The ATBCBhas been consulted in the development of this document in accordance with28 CFR 41.7.This proposed rule is not a major rule for the purposes of Executive Order12291 of February 17, 1981. As required by the Regulatory Flexibility Act,it is hereby certified that this proposed rule will not have a significantimpact on small business entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 5 CFR Part 900</ITAG>Administrative practice and procedure, Blind, Buildings, Civil rights,Employment, Equal employment opportunity, Government employees, Grant programs,Handicapped, Intergovernmental relations, Investigations, Loan programs.For the reasons stated in the preamble, OPM proposes to amend 5 CFR Part900 as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 900_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
