In all, the panel reviewed a total of 13such papers on a wide variety of topics. Because of space limitationsand because some of the papers were prepared for the panel on a confidentialor classified basis, it was not possible to publish all of the studies.Nevertheless, we present here 7 of the unclassified papers, each representinga significant contribution to the public literature pertaining to internationaltechnology transfer and national security export controls. Individualpapers are processed separately for the databases.</TEXT></DOC>
