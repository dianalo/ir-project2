On the eastern edge of Atlanta, bordered on one side bypalatial homes and on the other by public housing, the SouthDeKalb Mall has restyled itself as an &quot;Afrocentric retailcenter&quot; and is aiming its marketing efforts squarely atblacks. If it succeeds -- and early results are positive --the mall, owned by Rouse Co. of Columbia, Md., may serve as amodel for similar centers across the country and may promptmore retailers to target minority shoppers.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Black consumers have strong economic muscle,&quot; saysJeffrey Humphreys, a University of Georgia economist. Butthey &quot;have been underserved in their local markets.&quot;   Black spending power nationally is estimated at $250billion to $270 billion. Compared with consumers in general,blacks spend a greater portion of their incomes on apparel,footwear and home electronics, according to Sales andamp; MarketingManagement magazine. A study by Stillerman Jones andamp; Co.,shopping-center consultants in Indianapolis, has found thatblacks, on an average trip to a mall, spend $51.21, or 5.1%more than whites. And in a prime group for spending, 18 to 34years of age, the nation's black population in the 1980s grewmore than twice as rapidly as the population in general.   Malls in other areas are trying to attract otherfast-growing minority groups. In the Southwest, for example,the target is Hispanics, whose numbers grew at more than fivetimes those of the general population in the 1980s. TheTucson Mall in Arizona advertises on three Spanish-languageradio stations and hires a mariachi music group to help itcelebrate the Mexican holiday Cinco de Mayo. Half of themall's staff is bilingual. J.C. Penney Co., which spent about$6 million on Hispanic marketing in 1991, runsSpanish-language TV commercials, sends out ad brochures andcredit applications in Spanish and holds Hispanic fashionshows.   A two-year-old Canadian mall seeks to appeal to Asians. Atthe Aberdeen Centre in Richmond, British Columbia, a suburbanarea near Vancouver, nearly 80% of the merchants areChinese-Canadians, as are 80% of the customers. The malloffers fashion made in Hong Kong, a shop for traditionalChinese medicines and a theater showing Chinese movies. Kungfu martial-arts demonstrations and Chinese folk dances areheld in the mall on weekends. The mall developer will openanother Asian-focused mall nearby in the fall.   But malls aimed at particular groups still face obstacles.South DeKalb Mall, for example, has had to face the fact thatmany retailers won't locate in malls that cater to blacks,and other retailers offer blacks a limited selection. Inaddition, many local black professionals say they prefershopping elsewhere.   The mall, now 22 years old, didn't always focus onminorities. But in the early 1980s, DeKalb County had thelargest influx of blacks of any major county in the country.Today, eight of every 10 shoppers in the mall are black,compared with just one of three in 1980.   That shift proved tumultuous for South DeKalb. Manyretailers didn't try to adapt to the demographic shift; somebowed out and were replaced by lesser-known locally ownedstores. In 1986, the mall's sales began to slide an averageof 5% a year.   In 1990, acknowledging the change in demographics, SouthDeKalb started intensifying efforts to draw blacks. Thecenter has boosted both the share of black-owned stores -- to25% today from 15% in 1990 -- and the number of black storemanagers -- to 85% from 65%. It has increased the number ofcarts run by minorities and has doubled the number of blackcultural shows. Almost all the mall's advertising is nowaimed at blacks.   Several mall retailers have tried to orient their goods toblacks. Camelot Music more than doubled its selection ofgospel, jazz and rhythm-and-blues music. Foot Locker stocksstyles that do well in black markets, such as suede and blackathletic shoes and baseball shirts from the Negro League ofthe 1930s. J.C. Penney sells Gambian apparel, kufi hats andAfrican wooden masks. The retailer also has Malcolm XT-shirts and women's apparel in vivid colors that the storesays sell well among blacks. Mall carts hawk black-studiesbooks and memorabilia from black colleges.   The new approach has helped turn South DeKalb around. TheFoot Locker store, for instance, had sales of $1.8 million in1991, twice the chain's average in the area and higher thanall but one other Foot Locker in Atlanta. Traffic and saleshave increased 20% at Camelot Music since it changed itsmerchandise mix and remodeled. Even outlets that don't toutproducts with an Afrocentric theme -- including Radio Shackand apparel stores such as the Limited and Garage -- havebenefited from renewed local interest in the mall.   In all, sales at South DeKalb have jumped 17% since 1989,although the recession held the 1991 increase to 3%. LastChristmas, a black Santa Claus replaced the mall'straditional white Santa and sales of Santa items rose 51%.   For many local residents, the mall has become a focalpoint for racial pride. People shop there out of loyalty tothe neighborhood and delight in seeing signs of blackculture. Edward Price, an associate manager at Southern Bell,spent nearly $800 on Christmas gifts at South DeKalb. &quot;Weneed something to rally around,&quot; he says. &quot;I want to drop asmuch money into that mall as possible.&quot;   Marketers around the country, in fact, are beginning tocapitalize on a renewed cultural pride among blacks. Morecompanies are introducing products specifically aimed atminorities, such as cosmetics and hosiery designed for darkerskin tones. On a larger scale, as development of other mallsslows, &quot;retailers and malls are desperate to find newmodels,&quot; says Peter Doherty, vice president of ImpactResources Inc., retail consultants in Columbus, Ohio.   Still, South DeKalb has had its share of problems. Whilethe mall has attracted national retailers such as Jeans Westand the Avenue, several other well-known chains, citing lowprofits, have backed out in recent years, including SpencerGifts, Florsheim Shoe Shop and B. Dalton Bookseller, whichtook with it one of the chain's largest black-studiessections. The mall says it has gone after four nationalchains in the past year that are resisting.   That's happening despite appealing demographics nearby: Inthe mall's ZIP code, 42% of the households earn more than$50,000, according to Claritas Corp., a marketing concern inAlexandria, Va.   Industry executives say the problem lies in perceptions:Some retailers automatically pigeonhole blacks aslower-income people. There's a feeling that &quot;volume won't beas great,&quot; says Jeffrey Langfelder, president of ShoppingCenter Group Inc., a commercial real estate broker inAtlanta. Marc Milgram, also at Shopping Center Group, addsthat many retailers &quot;unfairly equate black areas with highercrime.&quot;   Blacks themselves don't universally embrace South DeKalb.Charlie Carter, an economics professor at nearby ClarkAtlanta University, says some black shoppers believe thatquality suffers in black-run stores. In addition, SouthDeKalb has poor neighborhoods on its fringes, and someaffluent blacks are wary of mixing with a low-income crowd.&quot;A lot of professional people want to separate themselvesfrom it,&quot; says Tommy Gregory, assistant manager at FootLocker.   Many upper-income blacks who live near the mall drive 20minutes to shop elsewhere. They say the mall's selection istoo limited, and they scoff at the notion of fashions aimedat blacks.   Emerson Bryan, an official with the Atlanta RegionalCommission, lives less than two miles from the mall, butother than buying toothpaste and filling prescriptions atSouth DeKalb, he says, &quot;I don't do my major shopping there.&quot;He says South DeKalb sells &quot;ethnic variety&quot; clothes that hecouldn't wear to work.   &quot;When the stores see an area that's all black, they assumewe're all the same,&quot; he says. &quot;They assume we're all rappers.We're not.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
