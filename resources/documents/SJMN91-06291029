Philipsto help the Dutch electronics maker unveil its &quot;Imagination Machine&quot; homeentertainment system.;   The $1,000 device attaches to a TV and plays specialcompact discs that mix sound, text, photos and animation. The company hopes itwill be as big a hit as Checker, Dick Clark and the other celebrities it hiredfor the glitzy debut at New York's historic Ed Sullivan Theater.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Business  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ANOTHER TWIST ON CD USEPHILIPS MACHINE COMBINES MEDIA  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     But for consumers, the new Philips system adds to an already confusingarray of gadgets aimed at their Christmas shopping lists.;   Commodore isinstant rival; Computer maker Commodore International Ltd. already sells a&quot;multimedia&quot; machine similar to Philips'. Computer makers -- including Philips-- are promoting home personal computers with CD-based multimediacapabilities. Many electronics makers also are pushing combination laserdisc-compact disc machines.;   But Jan Timmer, Philips' chairman andpresident, said he is unconcerned by the clutter.;   Timmer said Philips isaiming its Compact Disk Interactive, or CD-I, player, which it dubbed theImagination Machine, at a broader market than consumers who might buy acomputer.;   As for the Commodore machine, which also attaches to a TV, &quot;Wehave to fight it out. One of the systems will win or we will co-exist.&quot;;  Systems are incompatible; The Commodore, Philips and PC multimedia systems aretechnically incompatible. That means CDs designed for one cannot be played onthe others.;   The situation resembles the VHS-Beta battle in the early daysof the videocassette recorder. That left millions of consumers with orphanedBeta-format tapes and players.;   In addition, Radio Shack owner Tandy Corp.will sell Philips-made CD-I players under its Memorex label.;   Philips alsosaid its machines will play the upcoming Photo CDs from Eastman Kodak Co.,which will allow consumers to have their snapshots stored electronically onCDs and played back on TV.;   The machines resemble CD audio players and alsoplay these CDs. They will be sold under the Philips label, though the companyis better known in this country for its Norelco, Sylvania and Magnavoxbrands.;   Timmer said having the right CD titles, or software, is the key tothe success of its machine. Philips said more than 50 titles will be availableby Christmas, many developed by Philips itself. The CDs are priced from $19.95to $59.95.;   Among them are children's stories, &quot;electronic jukeboxes,&quot; amultimedia tour of the Smithsonian Institution and a photography how-to disc.;  Using a remote control device, users can &quot;move&quot; inside the subjects shown onthe screen. For example, on a Sesame Street disc, children can move around theon-screen cartoon, opening doors and playing the TV set and radio depictedinside a house.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Associated Press  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  New York  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911017  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1G  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  465  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday, October 17, 199100291029,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
