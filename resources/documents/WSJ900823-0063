Once again, the nation's addiction to foreign oil is atcenter stage. The battered nuclear power industry hopes for arevival. Environmental groups call for more conservation,more mass transit, and new provisions forcing auto companiesto boost gasoline mileage. Sen. David Boren of Oklahoma wantstax incentives for oil producers; Sens. Frank Murkowski andTed Stevens of Alaska want to drill in the Arctic NationalWildlife Refuge. The Florida Solar Energy IndustriesAssociation has even nominated Saddam Hussein for its &quot;SolarMan of the Year Award.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   But what will come of this new burst of oil-savingactivism? Unfortunately, not much.   The latest effort to wean the U.S. from imported oil isalmost certain to fail, due to powerful political currentsrunning against it. An environmental movement that's strongerthan ever, a worsening budget deficit, a White Housedominated by a free-market ideology, and intense regionaldisputes in Congress will all conspire to block anybroad-based effort to reduce the nation's need for foreignoil. And in the end, Americans will demonstrate once againtheir chronic unwillingness to suffer short-term pain forlong-term gain.   &quot;One has to be skeptical on the basis of past history&quot;that America will now fix its energy problems, says JamesSchlesinger, President Carter's energy secretary. &quot;This is asociety that has powerful antibodies against a consistent andpersistent energy policy.&quot;   Barring a catastrophic new loss of oil reserves from theMideast, the risk is that U.S. dependence on foreign oil willclimb from 50% today to 75% by the end of the decade.   A new Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll illustrates theAmerican public's ambivalence. Despite the crisis in theMiddle East, 57% of the public still oppose efforts toconstruct more nuclear power plants. And 62% oppose taxinggasoline to encourage conservation. On the question ofloosening restrictions on offshore oil drilling, publicopinion is more divided, with 48% in favor and 42% opposed.   For now, the greatest obstacle to most efforts to cutenergy dependence is the environmental movement.Environmentalists have already shown they can close down suchsubstitutes for foreign oil as the Shoreham nuclear powerplant in Long Island, N.Y., and offshore oil drilling inCalifornia and Florida. In a bow to their political clout,President Bush has tied his own hands by putting severallarge offshore lease areas off-limits for 10 years.   Meanwhile, the White House is resisting proposals tomandate energy savings. Such measures are popular in theabstract -- The Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll shows that80% of voters favor &quot;tougher conservation measures.&quot; But whenit comes down to particulars, such as forcing car makers toturn out more fuel-efficient cars, the politics get moredifficult. When the department finally got approval for itsmodest list of energy-saving ideas recently, President Bushkept his distance, leaving the department to unveil the planon its own.   Asked at his news conference yesterday in Kennebunkport,Maine, why he hadn't called on the American people toconserve energy, Mr. Bush quickly responded: &quot;I call uponAmericans to conserve.&quot; But the president added that,although it was &quot;a good time to conserve,&quot; he didn't want topanic people and didn't believe the circumstances requiredpeople to cancel vacation plans or take other drastic steps.Indeed, Mr. Bush stated that he didn't intend to curtail useof his speedboat during his holiday in Maine.   With a Texan at the helm, the White House is more willingto contemplate new tax breaks to spur the domestic oilindustry. But such measures run smack into another obstacle:a burgeoning budget deficit. With higher oil prices,increased defense spending and slower growth pushing thatdeficit ever higher, any proposal that increases spending ordrains revenue is likely to be a loser.   And if that's not enough to kill energy-saving ideas,Congress remains hamstrung by intense regional andspecial-interest disputes that pit oil-consuming statesagainst oil-producing ones. With an election approaching, theodds for that rivalry producing a sensible energy policy areslim.   &quot;This is where Washington is at its worst,&quot; says ThomasGriscom, formerly a Reagan White House aide and longtime aideto former Sen. Howard Baker (R., Tenn.). &quot;There's not a lotof people willing to set a goal that you won't achieve forfour to five years because, politically, it's hard to get anycredit back home when you're running for re-election.&quot;   Congress will certainly make a stab at enacting oil-savingmeasures when it returns in September. In the wake of theIraqi crisis, members will see an opportunity for action. &quot;Iwould misread Congress completely if I didn't expect them tocome back and to make this a major focal point,&quot; says deputyenergy secretary and former Louisiana congressman HensonMoore. &quot;We'll hear a lot of speeches. There will be a lot ofhearings. There will be a lot of advice given to theadministration.&quot;   Moreover, there will be several key opportunities thatwill test policy makers' determination to go beyond speechesand take action. But in each case, the obstacles facing thesemeasures illustrate how difficult it will be for Washingtonto produce a coherent oil-saving policy.   The Energy Department, for instance, plans to spend thisfall on a previously arranged effort to devise acomprehensive National Energy Strategy. The exercise mightseem an opportunity to devise a sweeping battle plan forenergy security. But already the effort has run into internalideological conflicts that suggest it will have only modestresults.   Earlier this year, when the department was drawing up areport on a series of public hearings to help prepare anenergy strategy, the White House sent a pre-emptive warningthat the final strategy would stress free-market ideas ratherthan government activism. Budget Director Richard Darman andWhite House Economist Michael Boskin maneuvered in internalmeetings to force the Energy Department to declare pointedly,in the preface to its report on the public hearings, that theBush administration's policies will focus above all on theuse of market forces to regulate energy supply and demand.   Such ideological pressures, coupled with the meekenergy-conservation plan the administration offered afterIraq's invasion of Kuwait, already has critics expecting amodest rather than a grandiose energy strategy from PresidentBush. Mike Matz, Washington director of the Sierra Club'spublic lands program, predicts the strategy is likely toendorse some steps toward greater energy efficiency but &quot;forthe most part it will endorse business as usual.&quot;   In Congress this fall, lawmakers will be considering ameasure that would force auto makers to produce fleets thataverage 40 miles to a gallon of gasoline by the year 2001, asharp increase in fuel efficiency from today's average of27.5 miles per gallon for new cars. The bill, offered by Sen.Richard Bryan (D., Nev.), was first offered as anenvironmental measure designed to cut auto emissions thoughtto heat the atmosphere, but now it is attracting interest asan energy-conservation measure that could save 2.8 millionbarrels of oil a day by 2005 -- more than the U.S. has beenimporting from the Persian Gulf.   But the Bush administration already has spoken out againstthe bill. And auto companies fiercely oppose it, arguing thatthey wouldn't be able to build the bigger cars that Americanswant for their safety features.   An even tougher bill has been introduced in the House, butit hasn't gone anywhere because it has been headed off byRep. John Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is a close ally ofauto companies and who heads the Energy and CommerceCommittee, which would have to pass such a measure.   Oil companies are hoping that the Persian Gulf crisis hasgiven them a lever to persuade Congress to open Alaska'snational wildlife refuge for drilling. That could be apromising area for oil-exploration. But oil from the ExxonValdez spill is still on Alaska's rocky beaches, andenvironmental groups in and out of Alaska will continue topose a formidable obstacle. Does the threat from SaddamHussein make environmentalists more open to oil drillingthere? &quot;The answer to that clearly is no,&quot; says former Sen.Gaylord Nelson, counselor to the Wilderness Society.&quot;Obviously those who want to drill in the arctic and everyother place in the country will use any excuse they can thinkof to open up every place they can find for drillingregardless of environmental consequences.&quot;   The Bush administration, with Congress's blessing, hasalready given a 30% boost to research into renewable energysources. But the effort pales when compared with those ofother countries, such as Japan.   Renewable-energy advocates are calling for a much moreconcerted government effort. But the budget deficit willundermine those arguments, as even the advocates acknowledge.&quot;We've got a massive deficit, it's costing them millions ofdollars a day to keep troops out there,&quot; says solar-industrylobbyist Scott Sklar. &quot;To say I ought to have a few hundredmillion dollars more . . . to bring in conservation andalternative fuels and that sort of stuff, I think {PresidentBush} is going to be reticent to do it.&quot;   With such formidable obstacles, energy consumers will haveto suffer a bigger shock before the U.S. public policyapparatus takes meaningful action. For now, voters seem moreincensed over alleged price-gouging by oil companies thanupset at America's energy-security dilemma. Says RobertTeeter, a Republican pollster and longtime adviser toPresident Bush, &quot;I just don't think we're far enough intothis yet to know how public opinion will be affected.&quot;   ---    What should America do to avoid an energy shortage?
