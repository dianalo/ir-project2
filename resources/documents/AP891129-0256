The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries' oil ministerson Tuesday signed a pact under which their daily production ceilingwill rise to 22 million barrels from 20.5 million barrels in thecurrent quarter.   The group's $18-a-barrel target price becomes a ``minimumreference price.''   The producers' output is actually up to 23.5 million barrels aday, and the new accord should bring it down to some 22.8 millionbarrels a day, analysts say.   That means prices for North Sea Brent Blend, for example, likelywill drop to $17 a barrel instead of to $16 a barrel, in thespring, when demand for oil usually slackens, analysts say.   The spot price of North Sea Brent Blend, the most widely tradedinternational crude oil, was $18.15 a barrel Wednesday morning,down from $18.30 a barrel late Tuesday.   OPEC's price of crude oil stood at $17.74 a barrel, said thecartel's secretary-general, Subroto.   ``We feel that if it deviates too much from the minimumreference price, then we will meet,'' Subroto told a newsconference.   In the meantime, OPEC's eight-member monitoring committee plansto meet in March ``in order to assess the market,'' the ministerssaid in a communique.   Leading oil ministers were upeat about the pact.   Hisham Nazer, Saudi Arabia's influential oil minister, toldreporters that prices ``will steadily go up after the marketascertains the durability of the agreement. There is morediscipline now, there is more commitment to the quota and theproduction ceiling.''   The deal should cut production by up to 1.3 million barrels aday, he said.   Fergus MacLeod, an oil analyst with the London investment firmBarclays de Zoete Wedd Ltd., agreed: ``It looks better than mostpeople thought was possible.''   The ministers came up with a partial solution to demands fromKuwait and the United Arab Emirates for bigger portions of theproduction. The two have been producing about double their currentquotas.   Kuwait agreed Tuesday to a quota of 1.5 million barrels a day,up from its previous quota of 1.15 million barrels a day, but belowits current output of 2 million barrels a day.   The United Arab Emirates officially agreed to a steady dailyquota of 1.095 million barrels.   But United Arab Emirates oil minister Mana Saeed Otaiba said hiscountry got behind-the-scenes clearance from OPEC to produce 2million barrels a day. That would be less than the country'scurrent output, which Otaiba pegged at 2.6 million barrels a day.   Otaiba also warned that the U.A.E.'s output would surpass 2million barrels a day if there were excesses by other OPEC members.   ``Agreement and understanding was reached with the oil ministersto allow the United Arab Emirates to produce 2 million barrelsdaily,'' Otaiba was quoted as saying by Abu Dhabi's official newsagency WAM.   But OPEC's overall producion still will be well above theexpected demand of 21.5 million barrels.</TEXT></DOC>
