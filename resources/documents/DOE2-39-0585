New results have recentlybeen obtained in this field by Marble and his co-workers at the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology. A fundamental problem due to Marble is thatof the interaction of a viscous-core vortex with an infinitely thin diffusionflame. This problem is studied here in the case of vortices that arecentered and uncentered with respect to the flame, for several equivalenceratios and Reynolds and Schmidt numbers. The case is also addressed oftwo vortices in uniform translation with respect to a diffusion flame.Finally, the interaction of a viscous-core vortex with a premixed flameis discussed. The findings presented indicate how vortices modify theflame structures. 30 refs, 22 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
