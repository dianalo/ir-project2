Is itacceptable to use a fork when eating ice cream?;    Our meals are alwayslively times for the communication of news, events and sports, in addition topersonal and spiritual sharing. Your reply will add to our list of ideas.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SOMETIMES, A FORK IS REALLY A SPOON  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  AdviceMiss Manners is the pseudonym of Washington, D.C.-based writer Judith Martin.Her columns appear Sundays, Tuesdays and Thursdays.  </MEMO><TEXT>     GENTLE READER -- Miss Manners is delighted to hear that you do more at thetable than eat. She considers this an invitation to pull up a chair and add tothe discussion, rather than just to point to an implement and then go up tobed while everyone else stays up.;    Let us note that we are talking slurpyfood here. Those who like fresh grapefruit and those who like ice cream maynot have much else in common, but they share an enthusiasm for the respectivedrippings of their treats.;    In order to eat grapefruit halves, one reallyhas to love them. It is so much easier to grab some juice for breakfast andnot have to worry about getting to the dry cleaner's before work. Grapefruitfanciers are not going to be satisfied merely eating what they can stab andthen watching the juice go down the garbage disposal with the shell.;    Therenot being any reason to eat ice cream except that it is terrific, those whosuccumb are even less inclined to miss a drop. Show Miss Manners someone whoeats the frozen part and leaves whatever is melting, and she will show yousomeone who ought to be eating grapefruit for dessert.;    When there is asimple choice of flatware, spoons ought to be used for both grapefruit and icecream. But since you like discussions, Miss Manners must go on to tell youthat one needn't leave it at that. There are more interesting ways to eat eachof them.;    For the grapefruit, there exists a spoon that comes to a point atthe tip, and sometimes has jagged sides to the bowl. This is useful for pryingthe meat from the skin, a procedure that one tries to perform on the fruitwithout also performing it on one's mouth. Older versions of these spoons arecalled orange spoons, because an orange was once commonly attacked in the samefashion.;    The ice-cream fork would seem to contradict Miss Manners'assertion that ice cream should be eaten with a spoon, but -- fooled you! --it actually is a spoon, with a very rounded bowl, only with fork-like tines atthe end for subduing brick-hard ice cream. There also exist ice-cream spades,which sound like an ice-cream fanatic's dream. But while it is true that theseresemble shovels, they are so tiny that one can't shovel much in at once,which is probably just as well.;    DEAR MISS MANNERS -- I am an 18-year-oldhigh-school student, and several months ago I got an anonymous love-hintingcard from a boy. I had no idea who he was, until last month. Though I am notsure whether my guess is right, I want to talk to that boy, but I don't knowhow.;    GENTLE READER -- Just don't talk about the card. Miss Manners hopesshe caught you before you mentioned the card and he denied sending it, eitherbecause he didn't or because shyness made him send it anonymously.;    But sheencourages you to talk with him in general, and to make a special effort toseem receptive to whatever overtures his courage may eventually suggest tohim. You may also send him elusive but soft looks without words.;    This way,you are protected if you are wrong. You may even be ahead then. After all, youlike the boy you think it might be, and if misidentifying him as your admirergives you an excuse for encouraging him, so much the better.;    DEAR MISSMANNERS -- I recently learned that the son of our former neighbors committedsuicide about a year ago. They were our neighbors for many years, so I felt acertain closeness to them.;    My first inclination was to write them a noteexpressing my sympathy. My friends cautioned that since so much time haselapsed, I'd be opening an old wound, and that since suicide is taboo, theywouldn't appreciate knowing that the news had traveled to me. (I had nointention of mentioning the cause of death.);    GENTLE READER -- Opening thewound? Do your friends imagine that it has closed?;    Miss Manners despairsat the rationales people will invent to stamp out courtesy and kindness.;   You have been close to these peoplewho lost their son. The cause of death isnot a suitable topic for a letter of sympathy, but saying you are sorry, andyou care, is.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Miss Manners column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910108  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  828  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 8, 199100008068,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
