According to members of the tax-writing panels, House conferees agreed to jettison the takeover provision, which has been one of the most aggressively lobbied elements of this year's $9 billion tax-increase bill. It was contained in the House-passed version of the legislation.    The provision would have denied deductions for interest that exceeds $5 million a year on debt supporting either the acquisition of the majority of a corporation's stock or a company's buy-back of a majority of its own stock.    Wall Street and the Reagan administration have said that the Oct. 19 stock market crash was precipitated in part by the provision's advance in Congress. Though many tax writers doubted that assertion, they acceded to pressure from corporate chieftains and members New York's congressional delegation to drop it.    &quot;We want to send a message (that) no . . . it won't happen,&quot; said Sen. Daniel Moynihan (D., N.Y.), of the provision.    Also dropped was a provision that would have disallowed interest deductions for debt incurred to acquire 20% or more of a corporation's stock or assets in a hostile tender offer.    On a separate issue, House conferees offered to dilute their proposal to raise more revenue from the corporate minimum tax. But the suggestion was still being debated by conferees last night.    Meanwhile, President Reagan signed a stopgap spending bill to keep the government operating through midnight tomorrow. Lawmakers are working to finish a $600-billion spending bill to keep federal agencies operating through the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1. The short-term measure, which the House passed, 272-149, and the Senate approved on a voice vote, was necessary because the previous temporary funding law was set to expire today.    Technically, the stopgap bill will leave the government out of money over the weekend. But that should have little practical effect, since most operations will be closed during that time. Congressional leaders hope, however, it will pressure lawmakers to finish their work before Monday.    House-Senate conference committees are trying to work out the final details of the big spending bill and a separate measure containing the tax and other provisions. The two bills are designed to fulfill a deficit-reduction accord between White House and congressional negotiators that calls for $30.2 billion in reductions from the projected $180 billion deficit for the current fiscal year.    The accord calls for a tax increase of $9 billion and $7.6 billion in cuts in discretionary spending. The rest of the promised savings would result from sales of government assets, accounting changes and reductions in Medicare and farm subsidies.    House and Senate tax writers exchanged offers throughout the day, trying to whittle down remaining disagreements. &quot;The progress has been slow,&quot; said Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) of the Senate Finance Committee.    The House conferees initially had offered to water down the takeover provision. After Senate tax writers rejected that offer, the House members dropped it altogether. The Treasury Department also opposed the provision.    The decision doesn't change an earlier agreement by the conferees to accept a House provision that would create a 50% nondeductible excise tax on the &quot;greenmail&quot; that corporate raiders gain when companies buy back their stock to thwart hostile tender offers. Greenmail refers to buying back stock from an unwanted suitor at a higher-than-market price.    Meanwhile, Budget Director James Miller and Treasury Secretary James Baker sent a letter to congressional leaders saying they would recommend that President Reagan veto the tax and spending bill if it contains a provision that would allow borrowers to refinance $5.8 billion in Rural Electrification Administration loans.    The two officials claimed the scheme, which was included in both the House and Senate versions of the bill, would amount to a new subsidy to rural borrowers and would cost the government more than $1 billion dollars in the long run.    The officials indicated, however, that they would be willing to accept prepayment of $2.5 billion in REA loans, if the REA made some changes to &quot;restrict abuses&quot; in its loan programs.    Also, lawmakers agreed to a two-year ban on smoking on domestic airline flights that are scheduled to be in the air for two hours or less. A House-passed provision would have permanently banned smoking on such flights.    Separately, lawmakers and the Reagan administration appear to have agreed to spend about $500 million for the U.S. space-station project in the current fiscal year. Congress had wanted to spend only $200 million and the administration had requested $700 million.    One of the issues still to be settled in negotiations over the omnibus spending bill is aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.    The Senate has voted to provide $9 million in nonmilitary aid to the Contras and a $6 million allowance for the Central Intelligence Agency to deliver both the nonmilitary aid and previously authorized military aid that is stockpiled in Honduras. Democratic House leaders have proposed giving between $5 million and $6 million to the Contras, but they would bar the CIA from transporting arms with the food, clothing, shelter and medicine. President Reagan has said he won't sign any spending bill that doesn't contain aid for the Contras. </TEXT></DOC>
