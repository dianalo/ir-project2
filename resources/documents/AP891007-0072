Many environmentalists want a ban on commerce in elephant tusks.Without it, they say, the beast that poet John Donne called``nature's great masterpiece'' could be virtually extinct in Africain a generation.   But the ivory control unit of the regulatory agency _ theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of WildFauna and Flora, or CITES _ opposes such a ban.   That has set the stage for confrontation at the CITES biannualmeeting beginning Monday in Lausanne, Switzerland.   Environmentalists say CITES opposes a ban because it dependsupon the largesse of ivory traders. CITES says a ban won't stoppoaching.   The population of African elephants has declined from 1.3million in 1979 to an estimated 625,000, according to a study bythe Ivory Trade Review Group, a team of environmentalists andbiologists from around the world. The study will be published nextweek.   Well-armed, highly organized poachers who travel freely acrossAfrican borders in pursuit of elephant tusks are killing 10 percentof the remaining elephants each year, the study concluded.   At that rate, elephants will be extinct in the wild within 30years, said one of the study's authors, David Western, the directorof Wildlife Conservation International of New York.   ``The elephant is in trouble,'' said Western, who hasspecialized in elephant studies for several years.   ``The loss of habitat is not the driving force, nor ispopulation growth,'' he said in an interview. ``The driving force,according to our studies, is the ivory trade.''   Elephant carcasses are left to rot in the sun on Africa's dustysavannahs while their tusks are shipped to Hong Kong to be carvedinto ``trinkets and baubles,'' said Richard Leakey, the eminentanthropologist who is now director of wildlife in Kenya.   ``Ivory serves no functional purpose,'' he said. ``We surelyhave reached the stage in our civilization and emancipation wherewe don't need to wear the parts of other animals to decorateourselves.''   Environmentalists helped persuade Japan, Hong Kong, Europe andthe United States to halt ivory imports, beginning last June. HongKong is the headquarters of the ivory trade, Japan its largestconsumer.   CITES' opposition to a ban has attracted little support, exceptfrom a few African countries that profit from ivory. Other Africancountries favor a ban, fearing the loss of tourism revenue if theelephants disappear.   Jaques Berney, deputy secretary general of CITES, denies theagency's opposition to a ban is related to support by ivory traders.   ``It's completely wrong,'' Berney said in a telephone interviewfrom the agency's headquarters in Lausanne. ``Our analysis of theproblem is not based on money. ... If we hadn't accepted thismoney, there would not be any ivory unit. And the system would havecompletely failed.''   Curtis Bohlen, senior vice president of the World Wildlife Fundin Washington, said, ``I believe the secretary general hasexercised very bad judgment in accepting these contributions,because it leads people to the very obvious conclusion that thathas influenced their decision on a ban.''   CITES (pronounced SIGH-tees) is the principal internationalagency responsible for the regulation of trade in all endangeredspecies. Since CITES was established in 1973 as part of the UnitedNations Environment Program, 102 countries have joined it.   At the meeting, delegates will consider a proposal by Tanzaniathat elephants be shifted from CITES' Appendix II, which allowslegal ivory trade with import quotas, onto Appendix I, which wouldprohibit ivory trade. A two-thirds vote is required for the change.   Berney said the agency's secretariat believes a ban simply won'twork.   ``The main problem is poaching, which in our opinion will not besolved by a ban on ivory trade,'' he said. Furthermore, a ban mightbe ignored by some countries, such as South Africa, which cullsivory from protected elephant herds, he said.   Even the most ardent supporters of a ban argue that it must beaccompanied by anti-poaching programs in Africa. But the ban is anecessary ingredient of any effort to halt the elephants' decline,they say.   ``The quota system for elephants under ... Appendix II hastotally failed,'' said Leakey. ``Let's see if stopping it willwork.''   According to CITES figures, its ivory control unit has received$308,647 in contributions since 1985. Of that, $238,470, or 77percent, has come from ivory traders, many of them in Japan andHong Kong.   CITES' other activities are supported by contributions frommember nations. Berney said the secretariat had proposed inclusionof the ivory unit in the member-supported budget, but delegates tothe 1987 CITES meeting didn't want to increase the budget.   Governments and environmental groups were asked forcontributions. ``The problem,'' Berney said, ``is that the onlypeople who have really provided money in considerable quantitiesare the ivory traders.''   Underlying the dispute is scientific disagreement over thedanger the ivory trade poses to elephants.   While elephant specialists see evidence of a serious decline,CITES sees little need for drastic action.   ``There is no disagreement about the decline of the elephants,''Berney said. ``But to say that the elephant is an endangered animalthroughout Africa is, in our point of view, exaggerated.''   Western, however, said projections indicate ``the elephant isgoing to be effectively extinct much, much sooner than almost anyother animal on the endangered list.''   Computer models developed by the Ivory Trade Review Group wereused to determine what action might stem the decline. ``Only oneoption made any difference,'' said Western. ``Ban trade entirely.''   He said poaching has disrupted the family and breeding structureof elephant herds. Bulls, sought for their large tusks, are soscarce some females can't find mates. The slaughter of femalesleaves orphans that die soon after.   From 1979 to 1987, Africa's ivory exports fell from 900 metrictons to 300 metric tons, according to the Ivory Trade Review Group.Yet the slaughter has not appreciably declined.   In 1979, the group calculated, poachers had to slaughter 54elephants to reap a metric ton of ivory. By 1987, after olderelephants with larger tusks had gradually disappeared, it took 113elephants to produce a metric ton of tusks. In addition, 55orphaned calves died for each metric ton collected. They producedno ivory.   The ivory trade is estimated to be worth $1 billion a year, mostof which goes to the traders and craftsmen. African countries whereivory trade flourishes earned only a few million dollars from ivorysales in 1987, Western said.   Elephants are worth far more to tourism, bringing an estimated$50 million a year into Kenya alone, he said. That is why Kenya andits neighbor Tanzania favor a ban, he said.   The Ivory Trade Review Group acknowledged in its study that aban carries risks. It will drive ivory trade underground, puttingit in the hands of criminals, and could push up prices by makingivory scarce.   The group concluded in its report, however, that ``to perseverewith the present inadequate approach is to make failure, and thedrastic decline of the world's greatest land animal, inevitable.''</TEXT></DOC>
