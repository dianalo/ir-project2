Local fallout could cover severalper cent of the Northern Hemisphere with potentially lethal doses. Smokefrom post-nuclear fires could darken the skies and induce temperaturedecreases of tens of degrees in continental interiors. Stratosphericozone could be significantly reduced due to nitric oxide injections andsmoke-induced circulation changes. The environmental effects spread theconsequences of a nuclear war to the world population, adding to thepotentially large disruptive effects a further reason to avoid such acatastrophe.</TEXT></DOC>
