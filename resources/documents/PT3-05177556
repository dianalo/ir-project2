The surface is scanned with an incident beam of light that      contains a plurality of wavelengths including at least one well defined      wavelength, e.g. either three well defined wavelengths corresponding      respectively to the primary colors, or a continuum of visible light plus      one well defined wavelength outside such continuum. The return beam that      is analyzed to generate the digital profile data is dispersed into a      plurality of separate return beams according to wavelength, the relative      intensities of such separate return beams providing the color data. </PAL></ABST><BSUM> <PAC>  FIELD OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The invention relates to three dimensional (3-D) color imaging of the      profile of a target surface. </PAR><PAC>  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  Monochromatic 3-D imaging of objects is known and has applicability to the      accumulation of detailed data on the shapes and surface profiles of      objects (articles, scenes and/or persons), to the automatic inspection or      assembly of objects, to robotics generally, and to various medical      applications. </PAR><PAC>  PRIOR ART </PAC><PAR>  It has been known for many years that optical triangulation can yield      accurate knowledge of range and hence of the profile of a target surface.      Typical prior U.S. patents that describe implementation of the      triangulation principle are U.S. Pat. No. 3,986,774 (Lowrey et al); U.S.      Pat. No. 4,171,917, Oct. 23, 1979 (Pirlet); U.S. Pat. No. 4,349,277, Sep.      14, 1982 (Mundy et al); U.S. Pat. No. 4,627,734, Dec. 9, 1986 (Rioux); and      U.S. Pat. No. 4,701,049, Oct. 20, 1987 (Beckman et al). </PAR><PAR>  The patents to Pirlet and Rioux teach triangulation configurations in which      the surface is scanned by a beam of light. A synchronously scanning      receiver images reflected light onto a position sensitive detector, e.g. a      CCD (charge coupled device), to generate electrical signals indicative of      range deviations of points on the surface from a reference plane. </PAR><PAR>  Beckman et al also disclose a measuring system employing the triangulation      principle. This patent is directed to techniques for improving resolution      by varying the cross-section of the measuring beam, and includes a feature      of viewing a lighted dot on the target surface at two different angles to      discriminate a true reflection from a false one. </PAR><PAR>  Mundy et al employ the optical parallax triangulation principle in which a      color pattern is projected onto the surface, shifts of wavelength bands      being detected on separate detector arrays, these shifts corresponding to      the profile of the surface. </PAR><PAR>  U.S. Pat. No. 4,645,347, Feb. 24, 1987 (Rioux) teaches another method of      measuring profile. It uses a converging lens with a mask having two      apertures. The spacing between images on a detector represents the range      deviation of points on the target surface from a reference plane, e.g. the      focal plane of the converging lens. </PAR><PAR>  Alternatively, the range data can be detected by methods other than the      triangulation method, such as by time of flight (radar) measurement. A      full summary of the various methods of optical ranging is provided in      &quot;Active, Optical Range Imaging Sensors&quot; by Paul J. Besl, published in      Machine Vision and Applications (1988) 1:127-152. </PAR><PAR>  However, none of these known systems also collects data on the color of the      target surface. </PAR><PAR>  On the other hand, there are many prior patents on color video cameras.      U.S. Pat. No. 4,072,405, Feb. 7, 1978 (Ozeki), for example, uses a prism      combination together with color filters in a video camera to separate the      three primary color components. Three detectors, one for each primary      color, produce the red, green and blue signals, which are processed into a      color TV signal. Total color separation is required, thus calling for      separate detectors. </PAR><PAC>  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION </PAC><PAR>  The primary objective of the present invention is to provide a method by      which the advantages of collecting color data along with the 3-D data can      be achieved in a way that is so simple that it requires only relatively      minor modifications to the known monochromatic 3-D cameras already in use. </PAR><PAR>  More specifically, the objective is to avoid or minimize the complications      of multiple detectors, or multiple color filters, or other major changes      to the components required in a 3-D camera. </PAR><PAR>  The invention meets this requirement by providing a method and apparatus in      which the target surface is scanned by an incident beam of light that      contains a plurality of wavelengths including at least one well defined      wavelength. A return beam reflected from the surface is dispersed into a      plurality of return beams which are received by a position sensitive      detector to generate signals that represent the color of the surface. </PAR><PAR>  In this system only a single position sensitive detector is needed.      Moreover, this detector can function monochromatically, i.e. without any      need for color filters or other color sensitive devices. </PAR><PAR>  As a result, the invention enables existing, monochromatic, 3-D cameras to      be readily modified to furnish color data. It is only necessary to change      the nature of the source of light, to provide a color dispersing device in      the return beam, and to modify the processing of the output signals from      the detector in the camera. In all other respects, the camera can remain      unchanged. </PAR><PAR>  In one form of the invention the incident beam comprises three well-defined      wavelengths, namely those of the primary colors, blue, green and red. This      form of the invention is convenient for recording digital color data along      with the digital profile data and for generating from this data displays      suitable for viewing with the human eye. </PAR><PAR>  In another form of the invention the incident beam mixes one well defined      wavelength with a continuum of visible light, the well defined wavelength      preferably being outside the visible spectrum, e.g. infrared, in order to      be clearly distinguishable therefrom. This form of the invention is well      adapted to applications in which very precise color measurements      (colorimetry) are required, since the signals received in the detector      from the visible continuum portion of the beam can be broken down into a      relatively large number of wavelengths for detailed analysis. </PAR></BSUM><DRWD> <PAC>  BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 is a schematic illustration of a first embodiment; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 2 shows signals generated in the embodiment of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 3 shows a second embodiment; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 is a modification of FIG. 1; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 5 shows the signals generated by the arrangement of FIG. 4; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 shows a further embodiment; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 7 shows signals generated in the embodiment of FIG. 6; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 is a modification of FIG. 6; </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 9 shows signals generated in the arrangement of FIG. 8; and </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 shows a fragment of a modification of the system of FIG. 1. </PAR></DRWD><DETD> <PAC>  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS </PAC><PAR>  FIG. 1 shows schematically a synchronous optical triangulation scanning      system that functions in accordance with the teachings of Rioux U.S. Pat.      No. 4,627,734 and is essentially alike in structure to the embodiment      illustrated in FIG. 12 of such patent. </PAR><PAR>  A light source 2, e.g. a RGB laser, produces a beam 6 that contains well      defined red, green and blue wavelengths. Together with fixed mirrors 10,      one surface of an oscillating double-sided mirror 4 scans the beam 6 in      the X direction and projects it towards an object 8. Light 7 received back      from a point P on the target surface of the object 8 is returned by a      further fixed mirror 10, the opposite surface of the mirror 4, and a lens      14, in the form of a return beam 12 that is imaged onto a position      sensitive detector 18, e.g. a CCD. Interposed in this beam 12 is a device      16 for dispersing the beam into separate return beams 12B, 12G and 12R of      the three primary colors. While the dispersal device 16 can be a simple      wedge, it is preferable to use either a double wedge or other device that      will achieve a collinear effect, at least for one of the beams, preferably      the green beam. In other words, the beam 12G will be a straight through      continuation of the beam 12. This collinearity is, however, not essential. </PAR><PAR>  The detector 18 measures the amplitudes A and the positions D of the      respective beams 12B, 12G and 12R to generate the signals 17B, 17G and 17R      shown in FIG. 2. The position of any one of these signals indicates the      range of the point P, i.e. the deviation of the point P in the Z direction      from a reference plane Zandequals;0, such plane being perpendicular to the optical      axis of the beam 12. The detector 18 is slanted to this optical axis      because the focal plane varies with range. Since the positions of the 17R,      17G and 17B signals relative to each other do not vary substantially, any      one, two, or all of these signals can be used to measure the Z deviation.      Usually the signal with the greatest amplitude will be chosen for this      purpose. If the color of the object is such that one of these signals is      absent or is too small to measure, the colors of the two remaining signals      can be identified by their spacing from each other. </PAR><PAR>  If the detector 18 is two-dimensional, i.e. has pixels extending in the Y      direction (perpendicular to both the X and Z directions) as well as in the      X direction, the necessary scanning of the beams in the Y direction can      conveniently be achieved by means of a further mirror oscillating about an      axis extending in the X direction (see the mirror M6 in the FIG. 12 of      U.S. Pat. No. 4,627,734 referred to above). </PAR><PAR>  While oscillating mirrors are the preferred method of scanning, it is      possible to achieve the same result by relative translation of the object      8 and the entire 3-D camera 19 that the other components so far described      in FIG. 1 represent. </PAR><PAR>  As in the prior art, a microprocessor 20 controls by a connection 13 the      scanning of the mirror 4 (or the mirrors, if there are more than one), or      the relative translation of the object 8 and the camera 19, while      receiving and digitizing signals 17B, 17G, 17R on line 15 to produce 3-D      color data that can be stored, used to identify the object or used to      create a facsimile of it, which data can also be shown on a display 21. </PAR><PAR>  A more basic triangulation configuration is shown in FIG. 3 wherein a beam      32 from an RGB laser, which beam is scanned in the Y direction by a      mechanism (not shown), is projected onto a surface point P of an object      34. After passing through an imaging lens 35 and a dispersing device 38      for splitting the return beam 33 into the three primary colors (not      separately shown in FIG. 3), such beam is received at M on a linear      position sensitive detector 36. As before, the shift Q of the point M from      a reference point N for a beam 33' that would be received from the      reference plane Zandequals;0 in the absence of the object 34, represents the height      H of the point P from this plane. As before the color of the surface can      be measured from the relative intensities of the three color beams. B is      the triangulation angle and the slant of the detector 36 is a straight      line projection from a point on the incident beam 32 that is intersected      by an extension of the central transverse plane of the lens 35, as shown      by the dotted lines. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 4 shows an embodiment similar to FIG. 1 except that the light source      22 produces a beam 6' that is a mixture of a continuum of visible light      and laser light of a well defined wavelength, preferably a wavelength,      such as infrared, outside the visible spectrum. Alternatively, the      wavelength of the laser light can be within the visible spectrum, provided      the resulting signal is distinguishable from that resulting from the      visible light. The corresponding separate return beams 12V and 12I      received by the detector 18 now generate respective signals 17V and 17I.      The signal 17I is used to determine the deviation of the point P in the Z      direction while the signal 17V can be broken down into a relatively large      number of wavelengths by the microprocessor 20 to enable a much more      accurate colorimetric measurement than can be achieved simply from the      three primary colors. This system thus makes possible the detection of      minor or other subtle color changes of a surface over time or during      processing of such surface, e.g. cleaning or otherwise restoring. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 6 shows, in simplified form, an embodiment employing the optical      configuration shown in Rioux U.S. Pat. No. 4,645,347. A laser 48 generates      a so-called lamina or planar, multiwavelength beam 49, i.e. a beam that      has a substantial extent in the Y direction while being very narrow in the      X direction, whereby to project a stripe of light onto the surface of the      object 8. By virtue of an apertured mask 44, a lens 42 focuses light 45      from the target onto a pair of spaced points on a two-dimensional,      position sensitive detector 52, e.g. a CCD array, the spacing between      these points being a measure of the Z deviation of the point P from the      reference plane. Because the beams 45 pass through color dispersing      devices 50, each beam is split, as before, into beams 45B, 45G and 45R,      the signals seen by the microprocessor 20 being as shown by the three      pairs of wavy lines 62B, 62G and 62R in FIG. 7. The amplitudes of the      lines are processed as before to generate data on the color of the target      surface, while the spacings D1, D2, etc. at different locations in the Y      direction between a selected pair of lines, say the pair of lines 62G,      indicates the Z data, i.e. the deviation in range. As in the previous      examples, the apparatus will include means for scanning the light beam      relative to the object in the X direction. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 8 shows an embodiment similar to that of FIGS. 6 and 7 but modified to      employ a light source 70 for generating a laminar beam 71 that combines      the visible continuum with a well defined laser wavelength as in FIG. 4.      As a result the detector 52 receives beams 72V and 72I that have the      shapes shown in FIG. 9. As in FIG. 7, spacings D1, D2 provide the Z data,      while the nature of the spectrum 74 indicates the color of the surface. </PAR><PAR>  FIG. 10 shows a modification in which the triangulation method of measuring      range and hence the profile of the target surface is replaced by a time of      flight (radar) type of system. A partial mirror 80 deflects a part of one      of the return beams, say the beam 12G, into a detector 81 connected to the      microprocessor 20. The incident beam is pulsed and the microprocessor      measures and digitizes the range on the basis of the detected time of      flight of the pulse from emission to return. The detector 18 need no      longer be slanted to the optical axis, since it is no longer being used to      measure range (profile), but it has been shown slanted in FIG. 10, because      this is its usual orientation in a 3-D camera and one of the features of      the present invention is a minimization of changes to the camera. Since      the detector 18 is no longer required to be sensitive to range, the      triangulation angle can be reduced to approximately zero, i.e. the      incident beam can have an axis approximately parallel to that of the      return beam, which is advantageous, especially when the target surface is      comparatively remote from the camera. Hence the FIG. 10 embodiment, while      calling for more modification to the camera than the methods of FIGS. 1- 9      by virtue of the need for an additional detector 81, has the offsetting      advantage of permitting adoption of a zero or very small angle between the      axes of the incident and return beams. </PAR></DETD><CLMS> <STM>  I claim: </STM><NUM>  1. </NUM><PAR>  1.
