(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Grumman Corp. plans to lay off about 10percent of its workforce or 3,100 employees by the end of 1989,including 2,500 from its main operations in Long Island, themilitary contractor announced today.   The layoffs will begin in early January, with notices sent to1,800 workers from various managerial and personnel departments,said Grumman spokesman Bob Harwood.   According to Harwood, the company will eliminate any unnecessaryjobs not directly involved in production. He said some productionpeople will be affected but most of the layoffs will be in overheadand managerial positions.   ``We are going to eliminate jobs we (Grumman) don't need in areassuch as security, personnel, public relations, businessoperations,'' Harwood said.   Harwood said all layoffs within the past two years have beencaused by declining defense spending, which has increased pressuresto cut costs.   ``For us to stay competitive we have to cut cost and cutting costtranslates to cutting people,'' he said.   ``Our whole industry is facing flat or declining budgets,'' saidGrumman Chairman John O'Brien.   In the past two years Grumman has been bumped from three majormilitary aircraft contracts. According to Harwood, in 1987 acontract to produce the Navy's Advanced Tactical Aircraft wasawarded to McDonnell Douglas and General Dynamics in St. Louis.Grumman also was shut out from producing the Air Force's AdvancedTactical Fighter.   During that time, the company fired 1,400 Long Island employees.   According to Harwood, the ATA would eventually replace the A-6E,a Navy bomber which is one of Grumman's most-produced aircraft.   This year, the government stopped development plans for anupgraded version bomber, the A-6G. That plan would have generated1,000 new engineer positions and brought in a quarter-of-a billiondollars annually.   Out of the company's 32,000 workers, 21,000 are employed on LongIsland.</TEXT></DOC>
