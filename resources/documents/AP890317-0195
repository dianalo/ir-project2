Now some of those countries are demanding a share.   All of America's major crops first sprouted in foreign soil, andthat's where plant breeders must go to look for varieties withvaluable genetic traits.   The need for ever heartier wheat in Kansas sends botanists toTurkey. For disease-resistant corn, they search Mexicanmountainsides. To breed the tubers needed for flawless potato chips,they go to Peru.   ``The United States has depended on the genetic resources of therest of the world to develop its agricultural base,'' noted theGeneral Accounting Office in a review of America's germplasmpolicies.   Now U.S. access to foreign germplasm is threatened by many of thedeveloping countries with the richest stores. They are angry theyhaven't shared in profits generated by new varieties developed fromplants that once grew wild in their own soil.   The key issue in this growing rift between developed anddeveloping countries is patent rights: whether or not plant breedershave the right to patent commercially produced seed lines. TheUnited States insists they do.   Third World nations call that genetic imperialism. They believecommercial seed lines should be exchanged as freely as the rawgermplasm that originates in their countries.   ``For years now, the Third World has been donating this materialon the principle that these botanical treasures form part of the`common heritage' of all humanity,'' said Clarence Dias, presidentof the International Center for Law in Development, located in NewYork City.   ``Meanwhile, (industrialized nations) have been patenting theoffshoots of this common heritage and are now marketing its newvarieties, at enormous profit, back to the Third World.''   Officially, the United States agrees that germplasm is the commonheritage of mankind. But the 1970 Plant Variety Protection Act and a1980 Supreme Court decision established the right of breeders topatent their products.   ``Our allowing the patenting of plants doesn't help ournegotiators who are arguing that plants are the common heritage ofmankind,'' said a knowledgeable congressional aide who spoke oncondition of anonymity. ``We're in Rome arguing `common heritage'and in courtrooms in the U.S. arguing individual ownership.''   ``Third World countries don't like it,'' said Rodolfo Quintero, aprominent Mexican biologist affiliated with the United Nations.``The potential for hurting the developing countries is real.''   Plant patenting, he said, has already denied Mexico profits itfeels it is due. A food developed from a Mexican form of algae waspatented as shrimp feed in Japan, and Mexican shrimp farmers are nowpaying royalties to Japan, Quintero said.   The ``seed wars'' debate has simmered within the U.N. Food andAgriculture Organization since 1979. The latest round will be foughtat a meeting of the FAO's Commission on Plant Genetic Resourcesscheduled for April 17-21 in Rome.   The United States will once again be asked to endorse theInternational Undertaking on Plant Genetic Resources enacted by theFAO commission 5{ years ago. The undertaking extends the principleof free exchange to commercial seed lines.   Mexico led the fight for the undertaking and the creation of theFAO commission to oversee it. Many of the ideas underlying the FAO'sactions came from the writings of Pat Roy Mooney, a Canadianeconomist who favors compensating developing countries for the useof their germplasm.   Currently 116 countries have endorsed the undertaking or joinedthe commission, including France, West Germany, the Netherlands,Great Britain and other developed countries, said the commission'ssecretary, Jose Esquinas-Alcazar.   But the United States has not. It attends commission meetingsonly as a silent observer.   U.S. refusal to participate could prompt a backlash in whichother countries would deny germplasm to the United States, some U.S.officials fear.   India, for example, the sole source of important varieties ofcotton and other crops, now bars the collection of seeds byAmericans.   ``I'm inclined to think that in that case it's an outgrowth ofthis whole FAO debate,'' said Charles Murphy, secretary of the U.S.Department of Agriculture's National Plant Genetic Resource Board.   Some U.S. agriculture officials favor softening Americanopposition to the commission because they fear it could furtherrestrict U.S. access to foreign germplasm.   The FAO's Esquinas insisted that U.S. membership in thecommission would not compel America to accept any position, butwould merely signal a willingness to listen and debate.   The United States is being hurt in the eyes of developingcountries, Esquinas said, by its failure to participate. ``Thecountries ask why,'' he said.   Hoping to improve the American position in Rome, the U.S.National Plant Genetic Resource Board called last year forreconsideration of U.S. opposition to the undertaking.   Germplasm experts from around the world met at Keystone, Colo.,last summer to try to find a way to resolve the FAO dispute. Theycouldn't agree on how to reconcile patenting and the FAOundertaking. But they did agree to support an existing internationalfund to channel money from industrialized nations to training andconservation programs in developing countries.   The fund was established by the FAO in 1987, and it has receivedpledges of about $500,000 so far, Esquinas said.   Still, the odds remain against the United States joining thecommission in April, said Wayne Denney, a USDA official who willhelp represent the United States at the April meeting.   ``It will suggest that something we opposed vigorously in manyforums wasn't so bad after all.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed AMs, March 29</NOTE></DOC>
