Transportation Secretary SamSkinner's decision last week to allow more foreign investmentin U.S. airlines may give the industry the needed altitude toavoid a crash.   Secretary Skinner has come a long way since 1989, when hewanted to restrain foreign ownership of U.S. airlines, as ifit made any real difference whether a stockholder hailed fromParis, France, instead of Paris, Texas. Last week, heannounced his department would allow foreign investors toacquire up to 49% of an airline's equity. So long asforeigners do not control more than 25% of a company's votingstock they will not be deemed in violation of Congress'sdefinition of &quot;foreign control.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Limits on the amount of capital that foreign owners caninject into U.S. airlines are nonsensical, but Mr. Skinnerwent as far as he could without asking for changes in thelaw. His ruling will allow KLM, the Dutch airline, to keepits $400 million investment in Northwest Airlines. Perhaps ifhis decision had come earlier, Eastern Airlines might havebeen able to hang on by acquiring a foreign white knight.   At the same time that he allowed more foreign capital intothe airline industry, Secretary Skinner shot down suggestionsthat airline deregulation had been a mistake. &quot;It isremarkable that some still argue that deregulation was a badidea,&quot; he said. &quot;It is time to declare the deregulationdebate over and get on with the challenges of the 1990s.&quot;   Those challenges center largely around eliminatinganti-competitive elements that the deregulation of fares androutes didn't address. The failure to build any new airportssince 1976 has meant that existing airlines are able tonegotiate long-term leases, thus tying up most of the gatesand giving them effective veto power over the expansion ofcapacity. Airlines can then create &quot;fortress hubs.&quot; Airlinestake in 27% more revenue at airports where they dominatetraffic than where there is effective competition. The onlyreason many provisions of airport leases aren't the subjectof antitrust action is that airports have been grantedmunicipal immunity from antitrust laws.   One way to break up &quot;fortress hubs,&quot; would be to followBritain's example and allow the ownership or operation ofairports by private companies. Then airports might behaveless like a complacent company store and more like a shoppingmall that doesn't want to be at the mercy of a single tenant.Secretary Skinner is currently deciding how much leeway togive airports such as Albany, N.Y., and Youngstown, Ohio,that want to sell themselves to the private sector.   Another battering ram against &quot;fortress hubs,&quot; would be toallow foreign airlines to carry passengers from one U.S. cityto another. Currently, foreign carriers can fly into New Yorkor Chicago from, say, Europe but not go on to Kansas City orNashville. Even U.S. airlines, which mostly are allowed tofly between European cities, are softening their oppositionto letting foreign carriers offer domestic U.S. service.Robert Crandall, the CEO of American Airlines, has said itwill be difficult to keep foreign carriers out of domesticmarkets once European air traffic is deregulated in 1992.   The flight path Secretary Skinner has filed for thenation's transportation policy strikes us as both sound andsafe. It relies on improving the operation of a deregulatedindustry, not returning to the second-guessing of government.If Congress allows more competition in the airline industry,there is every reason to believe that once the economyimproves, the U.S. airline industry can come back strongerthan ever.</TEXT></DOC>
