And in perhaps his last White House news conference, Reaganrepeated that he did not believe his administration was bargainingwith terrorists when it entered into the Iran-Contra affair.   ``We were not negotiating with them in the so-called Iran-Contraaffair at all. We were heeding a plea from some individuals ... Andthese people were among those who were planning ahead to have agovernment'' after the death of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini.Khomeini remains the spiritual head of Iran.   Reagan said he would be willing to negotiate with Tehran, withwhich Washington has had no formal diplomatic ties since the 1979-81hostage crisis.   ``There are conditions that have to be met also there. Anytimethat they are ready to come forward on an open basis, we would beready to talk to them,'' Reagan said.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater, speaking to reportersimmediately after the news conference, said Reagan was not referringto any new circumstances under which the United States wouldnegotiate with Iran, saying the terms that Reagan alluded to ``arethe same conditions that we've been talking about all along.''   ``We have said that there would have to be authoritativerepresentatives of the government of Iran'' to negotiate with andthat ``they would have to acknowledge this publicly,'' Fitzwatersaid.   ``We'll be glad to talk, but we've never been able to get them todo that,'' the spokesman said.   Fitzwater said that releasing U.S. hostages held captive inLebanon by pro-Iranian elements was not a precondition todiscussions with Tehran.   Anita Stockman, a State Department spokeswoman, also said thatthe administration ``has always maintained that we are prepared totalk with the Iranians if it is somebody that is serious andsomebody in authority.''   ``We have extended an invitation to meet in a serious setting,and have not gotten any response to that,'' she said. ``We havemaintained all along that any one with influence with thekidnappers, and that includes the Iranians, should use it to wintheir freedom.''   The State Department's Office for Counter-Terrorism says that asof Oct. 5, 1988, 15 foreign hostages remain in Lebanon _ nineAmericans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and a Belgian.</TEXT></DOC>
