Yokogawa Medical apologized in a statement for &quot;disturbingsociety again and having caused so much trouble.&quot; It pledgedto exert every effort to prevent a recurrence. The companysaid it has moved to strengthen internal vigilance and isrestraining advertising activities, including temporarilybanning new ads, to express regret over the scandal.   According to Japanese press reports, Mr. Matsui received3.67 million yen ($27,185) between November 1989 and November1990 in travelers checks and airline tickets from YokogawaMedical in return for promoting the company's magneticresonance image scanning device to the university. Theprosecutor's office refused to comment on details of thecase, but Yokogawa Medical confirmed the arrest of the threecompany officials.   Mr. Matsui was on the Yokohama medical school'smedical-equipment selection committee. The panel recentlycommissioned the purchase of a Yokogawa Medical magneticresonance image device and two computerized image-scanningtomography, or CT, units for a total price of 691 millionyen, the Yokohama Municipal University spokesman said.   Mr. Matsui resigned his professorship at YokohamaMunicipal University last month, following the Feb. 14arrests of two other Yokogawa Medical officials and a ChibaUniversity professor on similar charges involving medicalequipment sales by Yokogawa Medical to the university'shospital. Local press reports said the Chiba Universityprofessor, Sadao Uematsu, took trips to the U.S. and Europepaid for by Yokogawa Medical shortly before Chiba Universitybought a Yokogawa Medical CT scanner for 230 million yen.   After last month's arrests the government orderedstate-run universities and hospitals to &quot;temporarily&quot; stopdoing business with the GE joint venture, which had about 60billion yen in medical equipment sales last year, pending theoutcome of an investigation. Yokohama city officials barredYokogawa Medical from bidding for contracts with the Yokohamauniversity and other municipal entities.
