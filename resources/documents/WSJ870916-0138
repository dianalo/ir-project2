Austrian Economics Minister Robert Graf told Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead and Acting Commerce Secretary Bruce Smart that the new sanctions will apply to goods that pass through Austrian customs-free zones, which are areas within the country where shipments destined for other countries can be temporarily stored without the payment of duties.    Such zones in Vienna, Innsbruck, Linz and Salzburg are an important part of Austria's economy, which depends on East-West and intra-European trade. The zones weren't covered by a 1984 Austrian trade-law amendment that placed curbs on unauthorized reshipment of foreign products brought into the country.    State Department aides said that if Austria delivers the promised controls and enforces them properly, that could &quot;go a long way&quot; toward improving the country's access to U.S. high technology. Current U.S. law generally gives neutral countries such as Austria less freedom than allies have to purchase U.S. goods. But the non-allied nations can qualify for the more favorable treatment if they enact tough export-control regulations.    Switzerland and Sweden, both considered neutral, already have qualified for preferential treatment -- a status that has enabled them to acquire state-of-the-art U.S. defense equipment and to bid for U.S. defense contracts. Mr. Graf told reporters that Austria hopes to gain similar status.    Mr. Graf said Austria's ruling socialist-conservative coalition goverment will enact the tougher controls this fall. &quot;There is no doubt that the amendment will pass,&quot; he asserted. &quot;We have {control of} 85% of the parliament.&quot;    In effect, the proposed Austrian law would authorize customs authorities to intercept shipments in customs-free zones if there are reasonable indications that the goods are intended to go to unauthorized destinations.    Traders in high-technology goods who are familiar with the proposed Austrian legislation said it also would recognize the right of the U.S. to request an investigation of U.S.-made goods in transit -- even if those goods previously passed through several other jurisdictions. Previously, U.S. requests to stop diversion attempts have been hampered by Austrian legal practice, which heeds only such requests by the last country from which the goods were exported.    Scores of &quot;techno-bandits&quot; have exploited the loophole that exempts customsfree zones from tight export controls in Austria. Commerce Department records show that 15% of all individuals and companies that currently are denied U.S. export privileges for violating export-control rules are based in Austria. That makes Austria the largest foreign base for such violators, ahead of West Germany and France.    Last year, U.S. Ambassador Ronald Lauder complained that Austrian officials allowed a shipment of U.S. computers to disappear from a warehouse in a Vienna customs-free zone after the officials were warned that the goods were being diverted to the Soviet bloc.    Mr. Graf, one of seven conservatives in Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's coalition cabinet, said Austria can't succeed in upgrading its high-technology industry without regaining U.S. trust. A New York-born former businessman, he said Austria also is trying to draw closer to the European Community without being a formal member.    Mr. Graf told U.S. officials that the new amendment will be drafted with the help of Chancellor Vranitzky and Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina, another strong advocate of export controls. </TEXT></DOC>
