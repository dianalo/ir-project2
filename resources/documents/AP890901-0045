(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Alligator hunters are poised to fan outover lakes and canals for the start of the state's second gatorseason in a quarter-century, and hide and meat processors won't befar behind.   Under new rules, the 221 licensed hunters must kill alligatorsimmediately by harpoon or bang-stick, a hand-held device that shootsa .22-caliber cartridge on impact.   Last year, most of the 2,979 gators bagged were captured andbrought to processors alive. Several airboats were capsized but noserious injuries were reported in the hunt, the state's first in 26years.   Dead gators must be skinned within four hours to keep the meatfrom spoiling, so hide and meat processors have made arrangements toget the fresh meat in cold storage quickly.   ``The industry has addressed the needs and is taking whateveractions are necessary to ensure that the quality of the meat ispreserved,'' said Dennis David, coordinator of state alligatorprograms. ``Many of them were making arrangements to have ice trucksand refrigerated trucks and large coolers to purchase carcasses atthe lake shore.''   Wildlife officials say the state's population of about 1 millionalligators won't be hurt by the monthlong hunt, beginning ahalf-hour before sunset today.   A study of Lake Okeechobee gators indicates the hunt actually mayimprove the health of the general population by reducing the numberof reptiles competing for survival, David said.   The state revived the hunt last year to help trim the gatorpopulation, which has doubled since stringent anti-poaching measureswere adopted in 1970.   Okeechobee, one of 32 bodies of water open to the hunters, isdrawing particular attention following reported sightings of an18-foot alligator east of Clewiston on the lake's southwest shore.   Yet, some feel it's mostly a tall tale.   ``It's probably 90 percents rumor,'' said Charles Lawhon of MooreHaven. ``If it's there, it's a well-smart alligator and it keepswell hidden.''   Hunters can earn about $500 for the skin and meat of a 4-footgator, and prices for large bulls can reach $1,000. The biggestgator bagged last year stretched 13 feet, 4 inches.   Parts of the Everglades in western Dade and Broward counties willbe off-limits, despite above-average alligator populations, becauseof excessive mercury levels.   The state selected 229 names at random from among 20,163applicants for hunting licenses. All but eight attended a six-hourtraining session and paid a $250 fee for the right to kill 15 gatorseach, David said.   David expects this year's catch to be about 2,900 again.</TEXT></DOC>
