But the SEC's move against Drexel also presents great risks tothe government's case, by providing the firm with its first bigopportunity to acquit itself of wrongdoing after months of damagingpress leaks and innuendo, criminal lawyers say.   The move also may reflect tension between the Manhattan U.S.attorney's office and SEC investigators, who have been assembling adossier on Drexel for months and were eager to proceed with it.   They reportedly had been deferring action until federalprosecutors completed a parallel probe of Drexel, a precursor topossible felony charges. But there have been signs that thecriminal investigation is facing delays.   Lawyers familiar with the procedure in such cases said it washighly unusual that the SEC took action before the U.S. attorney'soffice, because Drexel now has the opportunity to seek wide-rangingaccess to the government's evidence and cross-examine witnessesunder civil pretrial discovery rules.   Had Drexel faced criminal charges first, its access to thegovernment's evidence and prospective witnesses would be sharplyrestricted and could cripple an effective defense.   ``If I were one of the defendants in this civil case, I'dscramble like mad to start taking discovery,'' said MichaelFeldberg, a New York defense attorney and former federalprosecutor. ``If you're a defendant in a criminal case, the thingyou have the least of is information.''   The SEC's 184-page civil complaint filed Wednesday againstDrexel and other defendants, notably Michael Milken, head of itscontroversial high-yield bond business, alleges a variety ofsystematic, fraudulent activity conducted largely in concert withnow-imprisoned speculator Ivan F. Boesky. The accusations rangefrom insider trading to falsifying record books.   The SEC didn't quantify Drexel's allegedly illicit profits. Butthe deals mentioned in its complaint involve some of the biggestcorporate takeovers of the 1980s, in which Drexel played aprominent financing role through its innovative use of high-risk,high-yield securities commonly called junk bonds.   If the SEC can prove Drexel made tens of millions of dollars inillegal profits on those and other transactions, then the firm'spotential exposure is enormous: the SEC is seeking return of thatmoney plus triple the amount in damages.   Moreover, the SEC can seek court orders kicking Drexel, Milkenor other defendants out of the securities business, a potentiallyruinous prospect for one of Wall Street's most successful firms.   One of the SEC complaint's most intriguing elements is that itdescribes a relationship in which Boesky, once thought to be amasterful independent Wall Street financier, is little more than acorrupt agent for Drexel.   If true, this suggests the government's crackdown on securitiesfraud is focusing more on outwardly legitimate investment bankingactivities by big Wall Street firms and less on errant individuals.   ``This is the final phase of what many people have been talkingabout for the last couple of years,'' Democratic Rep. EdwardMarkey, author of a proposed law to tighten penalties for insidertrading and other securities fraud, said after the SEC action wasannounced. ``Boesky looked like the middleman.''   Nevertheless, the government faces a daunting task in provingthe accusations against Drexel, which persistently has said itwould fight to vindicate itself in court and has undertaken amassive public relations campaign in anticipation of a crisis.   The biggest potential weakness in the government's case isBoesky, who judging from the SEC complaint would be a star witness.As a convicted felon, Boesky's credibility could be shattered byDrexel's lawyers.   ``The question is whether the trail of transactions issufficient for the government to believe it has enough tocorroborate Boesky,'' said Gerald Walpin, a former federalprosecutor now at the New York firm of Rosenman andamp; Colin. ``I'mcertain both sides have attempted that analysis.''</TEXT><TEXT>   Editors: Rick Gladstone covers corporate ethics and practicesfor the Associated Press.</TEXT></DOC>
