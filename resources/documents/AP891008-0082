Current Arab oil reserves plus recoverable reserves andanticipated discoveries can satisfy oil demand until 2020, saidAbdul-Aziz al-Wattari, assistant secretary-general of theOrganization of Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries.   ``But a gap between supply and demand will then occur unless newreserves are discovered to help meet the accelerating demand forenergy from hydrocarbons,'' Wattari said in an inaugural speech ofa four-day seminar in Abu Dhabi.   The four-day seminar on ``Deep Formations in the Arab Countries:Hydrocarbon Potential and Exploration Techniques,'' is the first ofits kind in the Gulf and was organized by OAPEC and the Abu DhabiNational Oil Co.   Wattari told over 70 participants that world energy consumptionhas been increasing in recent years and was expected to continuerising in the coming years.   ``Increases in oil production and reserves should match that.And some oil experts forecast that oil production will peak at 75million barrels per day in the year 2010,'' he said.   Daily world oil output currently is 62 million barrels, of whichthe Arab world accounts for roughly 18 million barrels.   He urged Arab states to make use of new advanced explorationtechniques developed in Western countries.   ADNOC General Manager Sohail al-Mazroui, backing Wattari's call,said expanded oil exploration was ``essential in order to guaranteethe continuation of petroleum supplies at their current level.Experts believe there will be an increased global dependence onArab oil as reserves of other oil-producing nations will vanish inthe future.''    </TEXT></DOC>
