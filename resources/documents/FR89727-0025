In 1976, this exemption was transferred to2 U.S.C. 431(e)(5)(g). The 1979 FECA Amendments extended the loan exemptionto include other lending institutions and also sought to clarify when aloan is made in the ordinary course of business by adding, <T3>inter alia,</T3> the requirement that any such loan ``shall be madeon a basis which assures repayment * * *'' 2 U.S.C. 431(8)(B)(vii)(II).This phrase has become a focal point in the Commission's administrationof the Act's loan provisions through the enforcement process and advisoryopinions. In mid-1986, the Commission determined to explore the possibilityof drafting more specific regulatory standards on this issue. At that time,this project was part of proposed changes to Title 26; subsequently, theCommission decided to consider bank loans separately. Thus, the Commissionhas published two Notices seeking public comment on possible approachesin this area.1<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>1 On August 5, 1986, the Commission published a Notice ofProposed Rulemaking on Public Financing. 51 F.R. 28154. In that Notice,the Commission raised its concerns about loans from lending institutionsand sought comment on several alternative applications of the statutoryphrase ``made on a basis which assures repayment'' in the context of publiclyfunded campaigns as well as congressional candidates and other politicalcommittees. The Commission received fifteen comments that responded tothis aspect of the August Notice. In addition, the Commission's publichearing on the public financing proposals addressed some aspects of theloan question.<ITAG tagnum="28">On January 22, 1987, the Commission published a second Notice thatfocused solely on the loan issue. 52 F.R. 2416. This notice analyzed thecomments received to date, sought further comment on the alternatives presentedin the August Notice, and announced a hearing date of March 11, 1987. Althoughthe Commission received two additional comments in response to the secondNotice, it did not receive any requests to testify and, therefore, it cancelledthe public hearing.</ITAG>Both of these Notices explained the questions at issue. In particular,both Notices indicated that problems have arisen regarding the applicationof the statutory requirement that a bank loan be ``made on a basis whichassures repayment.'' <T3>See </T3>2 U.S.C. 431(8)(B)(vii)(II) and 11 CFR 100.7(b)(11) and 100.8(b)(12).The legislative history of the FECA makes it evident that while banks arepermitted to make loans to federal candidates and political committees,Congress did not intend such loans to become a vehicle for banks to makeprohibited contributions. S. Rep. No. 229, 92d Cong., 1st Sess. 121 (1971).<T3>See also </T3>2 U.S.C. 441b(a). The Commission, in administering thisprovision, is therefore seeking to balance established lending policy withthe requirements of the FECA. To determine how it can best accomplish thisgoal, the Commission, in its Notices, invited public comment on three possibleapproaches to interpreting the phrase ``made on a basis which assures repayment.''The first approach would have required candidates and political committeesto secure loans by pledging traditional types of collateral, such as realestate, personal property, goods, negotiable instruments, certificatesof deposit, chattel papers, stocks, accounts receivable and cash on deposit.The second approach would have allowed candidates and committees to pledgenon-traditional types of collateral such as future receipts of federalpayments for presidential candidates (``public financing payments'') under11 CFR Part 9004 or Part 9034, future receipts of contributions and futurereceipts of interest income for all federal candidates. Candidates mustdeposit these funds, upon receipt, in a separate ``collateral account,''for this non-traditional collateral to constitute an adequate assuranceof repayment. The final approach discussed in the Notices would have requiredthe Commission to revise its current course. Under this approach, the statutewould have been read as requiring only that a written instrument evidencethe loan, and that the loan include a due date or amortization schedulein order to comply with the requirement that the loan be made on a basiswhich assures repayment. The Commission has reviewed the comments it has received along with relevantadvisory opinions, past enforcement actions and the legislative historyof the Act. The comments received on the three approaches have demonstratedboth the positive and negative aspects of these initial concepts. The first approach, which would have required a candidate or politicalcommittee to secure a loan with some form of traditional collateral, hasmerit in that it would allow the Commission to determine with a level ofexactitude whether a loan is made on a basis which assures repayment. Withthis approach, however, unless candidates or political committees haveextensive personal holdings, they are limited by the lack of availablecollateral. In addition, there are some limitations on the ability of candidatesand other persons to guarantee loans. In the case of publicly-financedpresidential candidates, the Act limits the amount a candidate can spendfrom personal funds; any personal guarantees made on the loan would counttoward this limit. <T3>See </T3>26 U.S.C. 9004(d) and 9035. While persons other than the debtorcan guarantee the loan, in the context of bank loans to candidates andpolitical committees such loan guarantees are subject to the Act's contributionlimits and prohibitions. <T3>See e.g.</T3>, 2 U.S.C. 441a(a) and 441b. The second approach was a modified version of the traditional approach.It would have permitted candidates and political committees to use collateralwhich is more widely available to them. These forms of collateral includea candidate's reasonable expectation of future contributions, public fundsor interest income. While bank regulatory agencies do not see any problemwith these types of non-traditional collateral, both the Federal DepositInsurance Corporation (FDIC) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency(OCC) would consider loans made under these circumstances as unsecured.According to these agencies, such loans could be compared to the loansthat many banks currently make to collegiate athletes and students basedon the expectancy that upon graduation and matriculation into their respectivecareers their income level will permit them to repay the loan. Althoughthis approach requires safeguards to be effective, it does give politicalborrowers flexibility to use collateral that is available to them. One method of insuring that a loan collateralized in this manner is repaidwould be to require that future contributions or other future funds receivedbe deposited into a separate collateral account. Although bankers wouldhave to depend on the candidate's or committee's projected calculationsof future receipts, the establishment of an account at the lending institutionwould help bank officials monitor the status of the loan. Furthermore,the lender would be put in a better position at the time a loan is madeif the loan agreement specifies the types and amounts of funds that areto be used in retiring the debt, and specifies payment intervals. The third approach would have required only that a written instrument evidencethe loan and that the loan include a due date or amortization schedule.This approach does not appear to adequately address the issue. While somecommenters have warned the Commission about substituting its judgment forthat of bank officials or lending regulatory agencies, others have notedthat the Act contemplates something more than the presence of these elements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Rules </ITAG>The Commission is now seeking comment on proposed guidelines for determiningwhen bank loans are made on a basis which assures repayment. In addition,at the end of the proposed rules, the Commission has included languageto illustrate the discussion of the insider loan analogy in the sectionon <T3>Other Related Issues. </T3>Finally, the Commission is considering whetherto require committees and candidates to file a supplement to Schedule Cand Schedule C-P signed by the lender, which would provide more completedisclosure of the terms and conditions of bank loans. The proposed rules would incorporate elements of each of the three approachesdiscussed above. They would permit candidates and political committeesto obtain loans from lending institutions by pledging traditional typesof collateral, as well as by pledging future receipts of public financingpayments, contributions and interest income. In addition, absent eithertraditional collateral or other types of non-traditional collateral, theproposed rules would allow candidates and political committees to rebutthe presumption that such a loan was not made on a basis which assuresrepayment by demonstrating that an unsecured loan is made on another basiswhich assures repayment. Because 11 CFR 100.7(b)(11) and 100.8(b)(12) containthe bank loan rules, parallel provisions have been drafted for both sections.<T3>See </T3>proposed 11 CFR 100.7(b)(11)(i), (ii) and 100.8(b)(12)(i)and (ii).Proposed subparagraphs (i)(A) of the two parallel regulations would setforth the general rule that if a financial institution relies on traditionalcollateral in approving a loan, it must perfect a security interest inthat collateral. Guarantors and co-signers would continue to be limitedby the prohibitions and contribution limits of the FECA. The Commissionnotes that the proposed list of types of traditional collateral is notexhaustive and welcomes comments on additional types of collateral andpossible secondary sources of repayment that should be considered. TheCommission also welcomes suggestions on methods to insure that lendersperfect a security interest in such types of collateral. Furthermore, theCommission requests comments on the use of the term ``perfect a securityinterest'' as applied to real estate, securities, the types of propertynoted in Article 9 of the Uniform Commercial Code and other kinds of traditionalcollateral. Is this term broad enough to cover the rights or powers thatbanks can assert to ensure their recourse to all these different typesof assets?Proposed subparagraphs (i)(B) would permit candidates and political committeesto obtain loans from financial institutions by pledging future receiptsof contributions and interest income. Presidential candidates receivingor expecting to receive public financing pursuant to 11 CFR Part 9004 or9034 also would be able to pledge future public funding payments. The Commissionproposes that loans obtained by this method would be subject to a loanagreement requiring that when the committees receive such pledged collateralthey deposit it in a separate account for use in retiring the debt. Inthe case of candidates receiving public financing, the proposed rules wouldrequire such candidates to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to directlydeposit public financing payments used as collateral into this account.In addition, the amount of the loan or loans obtained by candidates andpolitical committees on the basis of nontraditional collateral could notexceed the reasonable expectation of the future receipts pledged as a primaryor secondary source of repayment.One suggestion, which is not incorporated in the proposed rules, is toconsider a loan as made on a basis which assures repayment even if thecandidate or political committee does not have a separate account withthe lending institution that extended the loan. The Commission requestscomments on whether an assignment, executed by the candidate or politicalcommittee, would ensure that the lending institution has recourse to repaymentof the loan, even though pledged funds would not be deposited directlyinto an account at the lending institution.It should be noted that most of the factors applicable to congressionalcandidates relate to publicly-financed presidential candidates; however,the unique circumstances of pledging public funds warrant some speciallytailored proposals. Under current 11 CFR 9003.4(b) a presidential candidatemay obtain a loan from a lending institution, in accordance with the requirementsof 11 CFR 100.7(b)(11), for certain permisible expenses incurred priorto the receipt of public financing payments for the general election, orprior to the beginning of the expenditure report period. Examples of permissibleexpenses are: expenditures for establishing financial accounting systems,expenditures for organizational planning, and expenditures for polling.Major party presidential candidates who receive public financing equalto their full entitlement (that is, the same amount as their expenditurelimitation under 11 CFR 110.8) must make full repayment of both the principaland interest on such loans within 15 days after receiving public financing.The proposed rules would not change the requirements outlined above forloans that are based on anticipated payments for general election financing.These provisions would remain in force to govern those loans where generalelection payments have been pledged. The Commission is proposing, however,to revise 11 CFR 9004.4(a)(2), which regulates the use of federal funds,to require that public financing payments be used to repay loans from lendinginstitutions when such payments are pledged as collateral for the loans.Currently, this section does not require such repayment, but rather makessuch repayment permissive. Section 9004.4(a)(2) would continue to cross-referenceandSection;100.7(b)(11), which, as proposed, would also state the repaymentrequirement. The Commission proposes a parallel revision for 11 CFR 9034.4(a)(1),which governs the use of public financing payments by presidential primarycandidates.Proposed paragraphs (ii) of proposed 11 CFR 100.7(b)(11) and 100.8(b)(12)would state that when a loan is not obtained using one of the methods describedin proposed paragraphs (i), there arises a rebuttable presumption thatthe loan was not made on a basis which assures repayment. Candidates andpolitical committees would then be required to demonstrate that such anunsecured loan was made on some other basis which assures repayment. Otherwise,the presumption will stand, and the loan will not be considered to havemet the statutory standard ``made on a basis which assures repayment.''This provision will permit some flexibility for candidates and politicalcommittees that are in situations where the methods of proposed paragraphs(i) for obtaining loans are too restrictive to permit the considerationof otherwise bona fide loans. By incorporating the flexibility of this``other basis'' provision, as well as the non-traditional collateral methodpresented above, the Commission is seeking to assure that candidates andpolitical committees with varying resources have a broader range of optionsto permit them to take advantage of the Act's loan provisions. At the sametime, the Commission wants to provide sufficient guidance to deter abuseswhich could result in impermissible contributions. The Commission welcomescomments on whether this flexible approach, or some other approach, wouldbest achieve a satisfactory balance of these competing goals.<ITAG tagnum="84">Reporting Loans</ITAG>In addition to the proposed rules, the Commission is also considering developinga supplement to Schedule C, and a supplement to Schedule C-P, in orderto improve Commission monitoring and public disclosure of loans made bybanks and other lending institutions. The Commission has included two draftforms at the conclusion of the Supplementary Information which have beenprepared as examples of the kinds of information the Commission might seek.Please note that the draft forms have been prepared to help determine howdisclosure of bank loans could be improved. Although the forms are notpresented in any final layout or format, the Commission is interested incomments on the categories of information requested. Candidates and politicalcommittees could be required to file one of these forms, on a one-timebasis per loan, at the time the loan is first reported to the Commission.Schedule C, or C-P, which provides information on loan sources, amounts,balances, dates, due dates, interest rates, and whether loans are secured,would continue to be required as well. The supplemental forms under considerationwould elicit additional information on the types and values of collateralpledged, interests secured in the collateral, and dates when depositoryaccounts for pledged contributions and public financing payments were established.If the candidates or political committees pledged neither traditional nornon-traditional collateral, or if they pledged an insufficient amount,the form would require the candidates or committees to show that the loanwas made on another basis which assures repayment.In addition, a separate section on the form would be directed to the lender.This section would require the lender to confirm the information that thecandidate or committee gave regarding the extension of the loan. Also,the lender would be asked to state that the loan was made at an interestrate that is usual and customary, in accordance with the lender's usualpolicies and practices, and that, in the view of the lending institution,the loan was made on a basis which assures repayment. This proposal isbased on the idea that committees have a reporting obligation but lendersare in the best position to state whether a loan has been made in accordancewith standard practice. The Commission is seeking comment on this proposal,specifically on the proposal requiring lenders to make these statements.One way for the Commission to approach this would be to require the candidateor political committee to obtain the lender's signature on the loan disclosureschedule in order for the loan to be considered made on a basis which assuresrepayment.One commenter who responded to the August 5, 1986 Notice suggested thatcandidates and political committees should be required to attach a copyof the loan agreement to the report disclosing the loan. Accordingly, theCommission is considering such a requirement. In addition, the Commissionis also considering requiring the filing of any related security agreement(s),promissory note(s), letter(s) authorizing direct payments and other pertinentdocuments. Further, the Commission welcomes comments on whether to requirecommittees to prepare a cash flow projection or other financial plan, whenfuture receipts are pledged as a source of repayment, and whether committeesshould submit such plans to the Commission as part of the additional documentationrequirement. The Commission is seeking comments on these possible reportingrequirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">Other Related Issues</ITAG>The Commission also welcomes comments on several other related issues.For example, the Commission seeks comments concerning the practicalityof analogizing political loans to loans a bank makes to its officers orboard of directors. Banking regulations currently require that these loansbe made on the same basis, terms and other conditions as loans made toother borrowers. These ``insider'' loans must be approved by the institution'sboard of directors and so noted in the board's minutes. <T3>See</T3> 12 CFR 215.4(b)(1), 2; 563.43(b)(1), (2); and 337.3(b). Bankingregulatory agencies noted that analogizing ``insider'' loans and politicalloans would allow the Commission to more closely scrutinize political loans.Language illustrating the use of insider loan banking regulations can befound under a separate heading at the end of the proposed rules. This languageborrows elements of the Title 12 regulations commonly used to evaluateinsider loans. These requirements are that the loan must be made in theordinary course of business, must ``not involve more than the normal riskof collectibility or present other unfavorable features,'' and must ``notexceed the loan amount which would be available to members of the generalpublic of similar credit status applying for loans.'' 12 CFR 563.43(b)(1).The need for specific regulation of insider loans may be comparable tothe need for specific regulation of loans to candidates. Insider loan regulationsprevent self-dealing and favoritism from undermining established lendingrules. Candidate loan regulations should similarly prevent political favoritismfrom undermining lawful lending practices. While the Commission would notprevent candidates from going to friendly banks, it can attempt to discouragefavoritism from overriding ordinary lending terms or corrupting an assuranceof repayment. Comments are requested on whether this approach, as an alternativeto the approach taken in the proposed regulations, would adequately servethe Commission's purpose of satisfying the statutory standard ``made ona basis which assures repayment.''Another issue is whether there is any additional information that shouldbe reported to assist the Commission in monitoring compliance with therules. For example, should these rules include guidelines or limits, eitheron a dollar or percentage basis, for the total amount of loans that a candidateor committee may have outstanding at any particular time? If so, how couldthe Commission implement such a proposal?As a further assurance that future funds will be applied to repay the debt,the Commission requests comments on the idea of requiring the candidateor political committee to set aside a certain percentage of future fundsin the separate account. This could be accomplished in a number of differentways. The regulations could specify a certain minimum percentage, or thiscould be left to the loan agreement. Also, this percentage could be ofall funds, or proceeds from a particular fundraiser, only of matching paymentsor of any combination of these future receipts. This provision is not includedin the proposed rules; rather, it is presented as a possible approach tothe dilemma of how to provide more of an assurance of repayment when aloan is based on future receipts.Also related to bank loans are lines of credit extended by lending institutionsto federal candidates and political committees. The Commission seeks commenton whether these proposed rules can be applicable to such lines of credit.Lines of credit may present some unique circumstances that could pose problemsfor the Commission. For example, a political committee could obtain a lineof credit, which at the time is based on adequate collateral, but not drawon such credit immediately. It is possible that six months later, the collateralinitially relied upon would no longer be available, yet the committee wouldbe able to draw on its line of credit. How can the Commission ensure thatthe loan is ``made on a basis which assures repayment''? Should the lenderperiodically review the collateral available? How could this be implemented?The Commission also requests comments on a suggestion to require loansto be reported earlier if they are made close to an election. This ideawould parallel the current requirement for reporting contributions of $1,000or more within 48 hours of receipt of the contribution by an authorizedcommittee. <T3>See</T3> 11 CFR 104.5(f). This proposal would be consistent with theAct's focus on disclosure of large sums of money received close to an election.Finally, the Commission seeks comment on the idea of requiring that loansmade to political committees and federal candidates include a due dateat or near the election. The banking regulatory agencies suggested thisidea, analogizing it to agricultural loans that are due when crops areharvested and stating that the proposal is based on a sound banking principlethat ties repayment of the loan into the source of the repayment. Politicalcandidates may have difficulty raising money to pay back their loans afteran election; on the other hand, a campaign's funds may be the lowest rightbefore the election. The Commission requests comment, then, on this repaymentrequirement. Would a due date at or near the election be a factor indicatingthat the loan was made on a basis which assures repayment?<ITAG tagnum="75">SUPPLEMENTS TO SCHEDULE C AND SCHEDULE C-P</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Schedule C-1</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="71">(Supplementary for Information found on Page __ of Schedule C)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="73">For Reporting a Loan From a Lending Institution</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">This schedule must be filed with Schedule C when obtaining a loanfrom a lending institution such as a State or federally chartered bank,savings and loan association, or credit union.
