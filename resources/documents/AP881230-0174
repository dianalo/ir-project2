(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A gunman who took eight hostages in a beautysalon and released all but one during a 24-hour siege was shot andkilled by a police sniper Friday after threatening to detonate abomb in a suitcase.   Michael Fane, 21, of Iowa City, Iowa, was shot by a SWAT teamsniper about 2:45 p.m. Friday at the beauty salon and all of thehostages were safe, Police Chief Robert Wadman said.   A bomb squad was called in to deal with the suitcase.   ``It did not explode when they attempted to detonate,'' Capt.Michael London said. ``All indications that they had at the time wasthat it had the makings of a bomb. I can't tell you whether therewas an explosive device in there or not.''   Police said they had believed Fane had a 9mm pistol but found hehad a 9mm look-alike pellet gun. Police said Fane probably could nothave killed anyone with it.   ``We believe Mr. Fane was suffering from severe mental problems''and was under psychiatric care, Wadman said.   Early in the standoff, police said the hostage-taking occurred asthe result of a botched holdup, but later said they didn't know whythe camouflage-jacketed Fane entered the Possibilities salon about 3p.m. Thursday.   Police sealed off the neighborhood and the gunman released fourpeople, including a young boy, police said. After negotiatingthrough the night, he freed three women Friday. His final hostage, awoman, was freed apparently unharmed after he was shot.   Police would not release the names of the hostages, but relativesand friends said three of the final four were Debbie McQueen, 28,and shop employees Darla Lordemann and Sharon Kuhlmann, 18.   London said Fane was shot while trying to pick up a package hehad demanded from police that was placed by the door.   At a news conference, London said police decided to shoot Fane ifit became possible because they believed he had a suitcase bomb witha ``pressure point'' that would detonate if he touched it.   ``About 6 this morning, negotiations deteriorated seriouslybecause they found out at that time there was a great likeliehoodthere was a bomb or the makings of a bomb or a bomb apparatus in asuitcase,'' London said.   Police evacuated bystanders west of the former bank building andmoved reporters and photographers a distance away because of fearsthey could be hurt if a bomb was detonated.   Fane, a 1985 graduate of Mason City, Iowa, High School, attendedthe University of Iowa in Iowa City for two years. His father, Dr.Larry Fane of El Compo, Texas, told the Mason City, Iowa,Globe-Gazette that his son recently received psychiatric treatment.   Dean Chandler, Fane's grandfather, said of Fane, ``He's alwaysbeen very passive and mild around us. This is the biggest surpriseof my life and that's all I'm going to say.''   The gunman negotiated undisclosed demands with police, Capt.William Crawford said during a Friday news conference. He would notsay what the demands were, but he did say the gunman had not askedfor money.   Sgt. William Muldoon said police knew ``quite a bit'' about thegunman, but would not elaborate. He had said the man had remainedcalm during negotiations.   ``He is talking, so that's always a good sign,'' Muldoon said.``He's not doing anything directly at this time to harm the people.... If he starts harming people we will have to re-evaluate thesituation.''   A minister and family members of the hostages were assistingpolice in negotiations. More than 40 family members gathered at anearby house Thursday night and were taken to a Salvation Armycenter to meet with police chaplains and other clergy.</TEXT></DOC>
