<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-1264 </DOCNO><TEXT>We have investigated the magnetic properties of liquid-quenched Pr/sub15/ (Fe/sub 1-//sub x/ Co/sub x/ )/sub 77/ B{sub 8} over the whole rangeof Co concentrations. The coercivity H/sub ci/ and the remanence J/subr/ depend on the Co content in the same way as in Nd/sub 15/ (Fe/sub1-//sub x/ Co/sub x/ )/sub 77/ B{sub 8} . For the ternary Pr-Co-B a highH/sub ci/ , as large as 15.2 kA/cm, has been obtained. In Co-rich alloysthe temperature dependence of H/sub ci/ and J/sub r/ is limited by thespin reorientation at temperatures well below the Curie point. Exceptfor Pr/sub 15/ Co/sub 77/ B{sub 8} , annealing of overquenched ribbonsleads to substantially lower coercivities. The possible microstructuralorigin of the magnetic hardening is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
