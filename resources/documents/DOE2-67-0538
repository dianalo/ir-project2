<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-67-0538 </DOCNO><TEXT>MAGNUS-3D is a professional finite element code for nonlinear magneticengineering. MAGNUS-3D can solve numerically any general problem of linearor nonlinear magnetostatics in three dimensions. The problem is formulatedin a domain with Dirichlet, Neumann or periodic boundary conditions,that can contain any combination of conductors of any shape in space,nonlinear magnetic materials with magnetic properties specified by magnetizationtables, and nonlinear permanent magnets with any given demagnetizationcurve. MAGNUS-3D uses the two-scalar-potentials formulation of Magnetostaticsand the finite element method, has an automatic 3D mesh generator, andadvanced post-processing features that include graphics on a varietyof supported devices, tabulation, and calculation of design quantitiesrequired in Magnetic Engineering. MAGNUS-3D is a general purpose 3D code,but it has been extensively used for accelerator work and many specialfeatures required for accelerator engineering have been incorporatedinto the code. One of such features is the calculation of field harmoniccoefficients averaged in the direction of the beam, so important forthe design of magnet ends. Another feature is its ability to calculateline integrals of any field component along the direction of the beam,or plot the field as a function of the z coordinate. MAGNUS-3D has foundapplications to the design of accelerator magnets and spectrometers,steering magnets, wigglers and undulators for free electron lasers, microtronsand magnets for synchrotron light sources, as well as magnets for NMRand medical applications, recording heads and various magnetic devices.</TEXT></DOC>
