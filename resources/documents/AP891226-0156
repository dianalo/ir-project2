Pessimists hold the field as China emerges from one of the worstof many bad years under Communist Party rule _ a year in whichtroops gunned down young demonstrators in the streets of Beijing,long-nurtured ties with the West collapsed and a decade of economicreforms ground to a halt.   China's goals for the end of the century, the quadrupling ofnational income compared to 1980, the smooth reversion of Hong Kongto Chinese sovereignty in 1997 and the triumphant staging of theOlympic games in the year 2000, are all suspended in doubt.   The key question is how long China can resist the storms ofchange that have swept through the communist autocracies of theSoviet Union and Eastern Europe.   Much depends on the health of the 85-year-old Deng Xiaoping, thepragmatist who brought prosperity to millions of Chinese with hismarket-oriented reforms but who also represents the oldrevolutionaries using Stalinist repression to stifle populardissent.   Deng's chosen successor is Jiang Zemin, 63, a relative unknownwho became head of the 48-million-member Communist Party in Juneafter reformist Zhao Ziyang was accused of supporting thepro-democracy movement and purged from all his party posts.   Jiang, the former Shanghai party boss, is believed to favoreconomic reforms but, following the current line, has come acrossas a hardliner since taking office. He needs time to develop hisweak political base and cultivate his political image, but if Deng,believed to be in frail health, goes quickly, Jiang could face arapid ride into oblivion.   His rivals for power are ideological conservatives such asPremier Li Peng and octogenarian President Yang Shangkun.   Their ascendancy would not mean a return to communes, backyardsteel mills and international isolation. But it would acceleratethe trend, already in progress, of re-emphasizing central planning,stifling private initiative and retreating on economic andpolitical reforms.   Their demand for unquestioning loyalty to the communist systemand Communist Party rule also would put them on what many Chinesefeel is an inevitable collision course with the forces of reform.   The Tiananmen Square movement for a more democratic, opensociety, crushed by the military, is quiescent but is certain tore-emerge when the government lets down its guard. Events inEastern Europe have bolstered beliefs that the Chinese governmentcannot forever resist popular demand for reform.   Tiananmen also has clouded China's future relationship with HongKong and complicated its long-term goal of reuniting with Taiwan,the Nationalist island.   China has promised not to touch Hong Kong's capitalist systemfor 50 years after the British depart in 1997. But the nearly 6million people of Hong Kong were badly shaken by the events ofJune, setting off a wave of emigrations among the colony's mosttalented people that is likely to continue until 1997.   The rival Nationalist government on Taiwan in recent years haseased restrictions on trade with and visits to the mainland,raising China's hopes of eventual reunification. But Tiananmenreinforced anti-Communist sentiments on the island and probablystrengthened the growing movement for Taiwanese independence.   Internationally, China's relations with the West will remain ata subnormal level as long as suppression of political dissent is anissue. That could spell bad news for the nation's economicplanners, who badly need Western investment and technology to carryout the modernization drive.   ``The bloom is off the rose,'' said one Western economist, whonoted that Western businessmen will be inclined to spend theirmoney in more politically palatable places like Eastern Europe orthe Soviet Union.   Investors are also concerned about the current government'sbacksliding on reforms and moves to re-establish the primacy ofcentral planning, fixed pricing and party influence in the workplace.   A retrenchment program, to continue at least until 1991, has hadsome success in cooling an overheated economy and bringing downinflation.   But China is seen by outside experts as being unable to competewith other rising economic powers such as Taiwan and South Koreaunless it pushes ahead with reforms, notably making pricescorrespond to market value.   Economists see a possibility of China becoming anotherYugoslavia, where high expectations for reform were followed bypoor follow-through and years of dismal performance.   Beijing's leaders, trying to reassert state authority over theeconomy, also are likely to run into a growing trend ofprovincialism and regional rivalries fostered over the last decadewhen local powers were delegated greater autonomy. There is a realdanger that the provinces, such as the prosperous southern Chinaarea near Hong Kong, will increasingly defy orders from Beijing.   China, with 1.1 billion people now, will have nearly 200 millionmore mouths to feed in the year 2000 and must substantially improveits stagnating agricultural output if it is to remainself-sufficient.   The nation faces other staggering problems:   _Repayment of international debts of $44 billion reaches a peakperiod in the early 1990s and the government will be hard pressedto find the hard currency.   _The education system is badly underfunded and little headway isbeing made in reducing an illiteracy rate of 20 percent, more than200 million people.   _The average annual income is less than $300 a person, the urbanhousing situation is abysmal and the welfare system surprisinglyinadequate for a socialist country. More than 20 percent of thelabor force is said to be surplus or redundant and little is beingdone to prepare the nation for a serious unemployment problem.   ``China in transition is a China that will be struggling toresolve formidable contradictions,'' U.S. Ambassador James Lilleysaid in a recent speech.   ``It may be some years before we can put a name or theme to thenew chapter China will write in the 1990s. In the meantime, we mustbe prepared for twists and turns that may defy attempts to label aspragmatic or political, liberal or conservative, reform orretrogressive.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Sunday, Dec. 31</NOTE></DOC>
