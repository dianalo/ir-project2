Besides the implementation of soil-mechanical standardanalyses (determination of the grain size distribution, bulk density,limits of storage density, proctor density, permeabilities, and shearstrength) of two selected salt spoils (heap salt and rock salt spoil),the studies concentrated on the determination of the compression behaviourof salt spoil. In order to obtain data on the compaction behaviour ofthis material in the case of increasing stress, compression tests withobstructed lateral expansion were carried out on a series of spoil samplesdiffering mainly in the composition of grain sizes. In addition to this,for a small number of samples of rock salt spoil, the creep behaviourat constant stress was determined after the compaction phase.</TEXT></DOC>
