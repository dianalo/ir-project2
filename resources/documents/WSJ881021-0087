White (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GM GME </CO><IN> EDP </IN><DATELINE> FAIRFAX, Va.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Virginia judge handed Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot a clear victory by freeing him to compete against his old company, Electronic Data Systems Corp., for data-processing business.    Circuit Court Judge William G. Plummer said Mr. Perot can't, until Dec. 1, 1989, sign contracts that will produce profits at any point during their life. But that leaves Mr. Perot free to sign not-for-profit contracts until then, and later to seek new contracts at profitable prices from the same customers.    &quot;It's hardly an injunction at all,&quot; said David Boies, Mr. Perot's lead attorney.    Indeed, the ruling falls far short of EDS's request for an injunction preventing Mr. Perot from competing against it, on any terms, until Dec. 1, 1989. That is the day his non-compete agreement with General Motors Corp., which owns EDS, expires. EDS had argued that Mr. Perot could perform only charitable work in the data-processing field until then.    &quot;Nobody beats our prices,&quot; Mr. Perot declared after the ruling. He termed the decision &quot;a great victory for our customers. If we have a contract of three, four or five years in length, we'll bid the whole thing not-for-profit.&quot; EDS officials, in response, called Mr. Perot's declaration &quot;irresponsible.&quot;    If Mr. Perot carries out that threat to undercut his former company, EDS spokesman William Wright said, &quot;He's got to quit saying he doesn't want to hurt EDS. It's time for the vendetta to be over.&quot;    Initially, EDS officials declared they had won in court. But later, Judge Plummer clarified his ruling by saying Mr. Perot could seek to convert initially profitless contracts to profitable ones. After that, EDS President Lester M. Alberthal Jr. said, &quot;This is only temporary.&quot; As evidence comes out in the full trial of the case, Mr. Alberthal said, it will show &quot;that any of these relationships (Mr. Perot) has entered into will be entered erroneously.&quot; Judge Plummer set that trial to begin April 6.    Judge's Plummer's ruling calls into question whether GM got what it paid for in the controversial December 1986 transaction in which it gave Mr. Perot $700 million for his GM holdings and the non-compete agreement. Mr. Perot has boasted in and out of court that he forced GM to accept a loophole-ridden non-compete agreement as part of the price of his departure, and Judge Plummer appeared to bolster that argument.    The ruling stated that &quot;no amount of testimony or argument can distort the words (in the non-compete agreement) to mean that Mr. Perot could do only charitable activities.&quot;    EDS officials and their lawyers had argued during four days of hearings here that the non-compete clause was intended to limit Mr. Perot to charitable work. But the agreement, negotiated by a former GM executive vice president, Elmer W. Johnson, and Mr. Perot's longtime personal attorney, Thomas Luce III, doesn't specify that Mr. Perot may undertake only charitable activities.    &quot;Why didn't they say so specifically&quot; in the agreement, Judge Plummer asked EDS lawyer William Slusser during final arguments yesterday morning. &quot;That's the easy, simple English that would have said what they wanted.&quot;    Mr. Perot immediately declared that he will still pursue such contracts as the $1 billion-a-year pact to process Texas's Medicaid claims. That contract, a cornerstone of EDS's lucrative health-insurance data processing business, is up for bids on Nov. 4.    Moreover, Mr. Perot's new company, Perot Systems Corp., may continue to hire away EDS personnel, so long as it doesn't work for profit. &quot;All we want to do is keep signing contracts and hiring people,&quot; said Perot Systems President J. Patrick Horner.    Now the question is how all this will affect EDS. Asked about the billionaire's assertion that he will sign not-for-profit contracts even on a long-term basis to win business, an EDS spokesman replied: &quot;No responsible man would do that. We defend ourselves against rational competition, not irrational competition.&quot;    Mr. Alberthal added separately that EDS &quot;won't do anything foolish&quot; like selling its services below cost. GM's Class E shares, which represent a dividend interest in EDS's earnings, rose 87.5 cents to close at $42.625 a share in New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday.    Meanwhile, the flock of nearly two-dozen lawyers for GM, EDS and Mr. Perot will go back to Dallas to pick up hearings in connection with the suit Mr. Perot filed there against EDS and GM. Mr. Perot's suit seeks a court order preventing GM and EDS from trying to block his efforts to woo customers and hire EDS workers. </TEXT></DOC>
