Clearly, many Americans are paranoid about every food that's not labeled &quot;100% natural.&quot; This phobia prevents us from focusing on real food risks, such as microbiological contamination, while we worry ourselves to death about whether there's something scary or artificial added to foods.    When you consider the extraordinary potential benefits of fat substitutes and other food ingredients being studied today, it's most disturbing to see naysayers reject even the notion of healthier foods out of some sense of concern for &quot;naturalness&quot; or &quot;purity.&quot; Many scientists today believe there may be a link between a high-calorie, high-fat diet and not only obesity, but possibly heart disease and cancer.    Sure, many people's health could be improved by living on a rigid low-calorie, low-fat, high-fiber, vitamin-filled diet. But are we to join with Puritans of earlier generations and condemn those among us to heart disease because they lack the willpower or desire to alter radically their diet? Does the &quot;sin&quot; of enjoying sweets or desserts or fried food really deserve that kind of penalty?    This attitude -- that everything that tastes good or feels good must be bad for you -- is not new. We're just seeing the 20th-century version played out in the admonitions that we have to suffer a little for dietary change to be effective.    Let's remember that we eat for pleasure, not simply for vitamins and minerals. If someone wants to eat fruits, nuts and organically grown vegetables from the back yard every day, fine. But for most of us in America, we look for a safe, nutritious and appetizing array of foods at the local supermarket or restaurant.    Let's not be afraid of seeking new understanding and ways to improve diet and health; and let's not condemn those of us who enjoy eating for pleasure, as well as nutrition.    Thomas E. Stenzel   Executive Director   International Food Information Council   Washington   ---   The general apprehension about what's good to eat and what isn't and your recent attention given to the food fat substitutes Simplesse and Olestra neglect to draw attention to the most important point. We eat what we like. We select and consume certain foods because we enjoy them. We love ice cream, chocolate, potato chips, fried onions and barbecued meat because our senses tell us to. Our desire for the sweet, the fat and the roasted has been programmed into us humans since pre-recorded history.    Eating is an enjoyable and emotional process that rarely responds to rational appeals. And neither the watchdog nutritionists nor a medical-scientific consensus on health matters will persuade the majority to change eating habits for life. It would be easier to eradicate greed or to bring about peace on Earth than to forgo culinary, gustatory pleasures.    Any product, device or practice that allows us to satisfy this basic human need of food gratification without the consequences brought on by overindulgence is a major accomplishment. For that reason, Simplesse and Olestra (and saccharin and aspartame) will go down in history as benefactors of mankind, right along with the wheel and the printing press, despite minor drawbacks and the cackling of critics.
