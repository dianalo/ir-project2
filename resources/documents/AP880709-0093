At least 32 Palestinians reportedly suffered injuries frombeatings, rubber bullets, and tear gas, Israel radio and Arabreports said.   The army put the injured figure at 11, saying it included anArab teen-ager who suffered a bullet wound after a clash in theGaza Strip and a soldier who was hit in the shoulder by a largerock.   The violence broke out a day after Israel launched a crackdownon the uprising by ordering 10 Palestinians deported after accusingthem of planning a series of anti-Israeli attacks and riots.   Today's strikes paralyzed commercial life by shutting shops andhalting public transportation in Arab east Jerusalem, Nablus,Ramallah, Hebron, Bethlehem and Gaza City.   In one clash, soldiers opened fire at the Aida refugee camp nearBethlehem after several Palestinians tried to grab a gun from oneof the troops and one of them threw stones, an army spokesman said.   Six Arabs were injured by rubber bullets, the spokesman said.   Troops also confronted rioters outside the villages of Abweinand Arura near the West Bank town of Ramallah, beating and injuringthree, including a woman, the radio said.   The army confirmed the incident saying soldiers used``reasonable force'' to detain Arab protesters after several dozenof the demonstrators blocked roads near the villages and peltedtroops with large blocks.   One soldier was hit in the shoulder by a block and taken formedical treatment, the army said.   Troops also injured three Arab protesters during a 90-minuteclash in Bani Naim near Hebron, Arab news reports said.   Among the casualties was a 45-year-old woman identified asItimad Daoud Al Manasra, 45, who was hit by three rubber bulletsand two Arabs treated after inhaling tear gas, the reports said.   In the occupied Gaza Strip, soldiers detained 20 Palestiniansand beat one of them after a stoning incident in Beit Hanoun, justnorth of Gaza City, said an Arab reporter, speaking on condition ofanonymity.   The reporter said Shawki Mohammed Khalil Odeh, 22, told him fromhis bed at Alia Hospital in Gaza that soldiers detained him at hishome after the stoning incident, beat him about the head and kickedhim.   Soldiers also maintained curfews for a second day on fourrefugee camps and part of a fifth in Gaza, Arab news reports said.   On Friday, one Arab youth was killed and five were wounded inclashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.   The fatality raised to 216 the number of Palestinians killedsince the uprising began Dec. 8 in the territories Israel occupiedin the 1967 Middle East war. Four Israelis also have been killed.   Underground leaders, apparently from rival factions, issuedconflicting leaflets calling for a complete commercial shutdown.Each leaflet called for strikes, but differed on when they wouldbegin.   One leaflet distributed this week by an underground Islamicgroup known as Hamas said today should be ``a day of escalation andstriking at Jews.''   The army said Friday it would deport six men from the West Bankand four from Gaza and accused them of planning and carrying outrecent anti-Israeli riots and attacks.   The men, aged 23 to 45, all have served prison terms on chargesranging from armed assault to membership in either Fatah or theDemocratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, the army said.Both are factions of the PLO, which Israel outlaws as a terroristorganization.   In a statement, the army gave no date for the deportations andsaid the men could appeal the orders to a military advisory boardor Israel's Supreme Court.   Israel has deported 21 Palestinians since the start of theuprising despite repeated U.S. protests that the expulsions violatehuman rights.   Friday's fatality was in the West Bank town of Tubas. Troopsopened fire, apparently during a protest, and wounded Abdel KaderAmer, who later died of his wounds, a hospital official said.   The army confirmed the death but said it was investigating thecircumstances.</TEXT></DOC>
