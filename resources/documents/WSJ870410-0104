The two superpowers seem poised to enter into a treaty to scrap intermediate nuclear forces, or INF, in Europe. The plan, which has languished since the U.S. proposed it in 1981, is currently coming under close scrutiny, and complaints are erupting that the agreement could make Europe more vulnerable to Soviet conventional and short-range nuclear missile superiority and decouple U.S. allies from the American nuclear arsenal.    &quot;Like Dulcinea (the plain peasant girl Don Quixote idealized), the more you look at this agreement, the less appealing it is to its critics,&quot; says Kenneth Adelman, director of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency. &quot;The more you go down the field of INF, the more objections you are going to hear to it.&quot;    Mr. Adelman says the administration, on balance, still considers the agreement a good idea and that reservations won't derail the push for it. &quot;The INF agreement raises a host of questions that could be dangerous,&quot; says Lawrence Eagleburger, a former State Department official now at Kissinger Associates, international consultants. &quot;However, the political costs of not proceeding, given the fact that we invented the damn thing, would be very bad.&quot;    Secretary of State George Shultz leaves for Moscow tomorrow to lay the groundwork for a final INF agreement. The arms pact, which would be the first entered into by the Reagan administration, is seen as a political elixir for President Reagan's Irangate hangover. Beyond the pact itself, there's talk of a superpower summit in Washington in the late summer or fall.    Under an INF agreement, as currently framed, the Soviets would dismantle 1,223 warheads on SS-20 missiles with a range of 1,800 to 5,000 kilometers in Europe and Asia, leaving them with 100 in Asia. The U.S. would dismantle 216 warheads and move 100 to the U.S. The question now is how to deal with the Soviet's approximately 130 to 150 short-range missile systems with a range of 500 to 1,800 kilometers. The U.S. hasn't any systems of its own in this range, but West Germany has 72 Pershing I launchers for which the U.S. controls the nuclear warheads.    Amid the rush to assess the INF deal, some critics charge that the U.S. first proposed the plan for political reasons, leaving the military assessments to the last minute. &quot;I think it's appalling that there's been no real thought about what a post-INF agreement would be,&quot; says Sen. Dan Quayle (R., Ind.), a ranking member of the Senate Armed Services Committee. &quot;They felt the Soviets would never agree to a zero-zero. When the Soviets said, 'Okay,' we were caught with our pants down.&quot;    Partly because the administration realizes the flaws in an INF accord, President Reagan will stress in a foreign-policy speech today a preference for more progress in reducing long-range strategic weapons. Mr. Adelman said those weapons would be &quot;the apple of our eye&quot; during Mr. Shultz's talks in Moscow. The Soviets are likely to balk, however, unless the U.S. shows new willingness to restrict the president's strategic defense plans and they'll be left with INF as the only possibility for agreement.    U.S. and European defense experts, convinced that the INF deal will go through in some form, are now scrambling to come to terms with the likely consequences. Many think such arms reduction confronts the North Atlantic Treaty Organization with the unhappy choice of paying for a host of new weapons systems, or accepting a military disadvantage in relation to the Warsaw Pact.    The Joint Chiefs of Staff are currently studying the military impact of an INF deal. Elsewhere in the Pentagon, planners are trying to set priorities for which projects need to be developed quickest once the nuclear weapons are pulled out. In Europe, the French are pushing through a modernization of their own nuclear forces, which will become more significant in the military calculus once the other missiles are removed. British and West German government leaders are raising concerns about short-range nuclear weapons, where the Soviets enjoy a significant advantage.    While the West could build up its short-range and conventional systems, budget constraints, fragmented planning, and a shrinking pool of potential soldiers make any significant buildup unlikely. More darkly, some officials fear that the INF plan is a milestone in the Soviet agenda of stripping Western Europe of the nuclear weapons that have long made Warsaw Pact aggression unthinkable.    Alexander Haig, who was Secretary of State when the U.S. first proposed the INF plan, says the proposal was &quot;prompted by a desire to seize the initiative in the psychological battle with the Soviets.&quot; Since then, he argues, the Soviets have largely shifted their strategy to shorter range SS-21s and SS-23s, for which the West hasn't developed any counter.    Mr. Haig and others also criticize the plan because it allows both superpowers to keep 100 warheads, with the Soviet missiles required to be east of the Urals and the American weapons returned to the continental U.S. &quot;It simply is a fact that it is logistically and politically easier to redeploy missiles from the Asian Soviet Union to the European Soviet Union than from the United States to Europe,&quot; says Zbigniew Brzezinski, President Carter's national security adviser.    Meanwhile, many Pentagon officials are worried that the INF deal would leave NATO more exposed to the Warsaw Pact quantitative advantage in conventional arms. &quot;We're outnumbered,&quot; says Air Force Secretary Edward Aldridge. &quot;That's just something we have to accept.&quot;    NATO has 80 troop divisions compared with 190 somewhat smaller divisions for the Warsaw Pact nations, 3,700 combat aircraft and attack helicopters to the 8,000 fielded by the Soviet bloc, and 19,600 battle tanks compared with 32,000 deployed by the Warsaw Pact.    &quot;The more you reduce nuclear weapons, the more conventional stability becomes a problem,&quot; says Karsten Voigt, a West German Bundestag member and Social Democratic Party foreign-policy spokesman. And while NATO has long relied on more sophisticated weaponry to offset numbers, senior officials warn that this technological edge is slipping. &quot;NATO's current qualitative advantage is eroding,&quot; Gen. Bernard Rogers, NATO's supreme allied commander, told Congress last month.    Within the Pentagon and the armed services committees in Congress, there's little unanimity on what can replace medium-range weapons as a deterrent to Soviet aggression. Some officials favor beefing up ammunition stocks and spare parts so NATO could sustain itself in a conventional conflict for a longer period. Despite a recent push to correct deficiencies, Europe has stockpiles that hold less than five days of artillery munitions, Harm and Shrike anti-radar missiles, and certain tank and truck parts.    Others are pushing more ambitious weapons programs that would cost billions of dollars and take years to develop. Deputy Defense Secretary William Taft IV says an air defense system in Europe capable of defeating Warsaw Pact bombers and conventional missiles is &quot;one of the highest priorities we've got.&quot; But he concedes that NATO military planners are only at the &quot;very early stages&quot; of researching such a system.    The removal of the medium-range missiles could well spark claims from a gaggle of contractors that their weapons projects are critical to offsetting the conventional weapons imbalance. McDonnell Douglas Corp. officials are already arguing that an INF agreement creates a need for more Apache helicopters. And Air Force Secretary Aldridge is pushing a new version of the F-15 fighter jet.    Army officials note that some systems to beef up European defense are already in the pipeline. LTV Corp., for example, is designing new missiles called ATACMs that can hit targets beyond the range of rockets and cannons.    The French are frightened by all this talk about beefing up conventional forces, however, arguing that the West should concentrate on stopping the Soviet aim of denuclearizing Europe. Prime Minister Jacques Chirac says that nuclear weapons are what brought his continent peace and that there shouldn't be any difference in the vulnerability of the U.S. and Europe to Soviet nuclear weapons.    ---           EAST-WEST WEAPONS BALANCE                                       Warsaw                              NATO      Pact    INF warheads    (1,800-5,000 km.)          316     1,323    Short-range launchers              approx.
