Walsh deniedFriday that the he illegally relied on the congressional testimonyof defendants in the Iran-Contra case who received limited immunityfrom Congress.   A brief filed by Walsh's office said the ``overwhelmingmajority'' of his case against former national security adviserJohn M. Poindexter, Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and businessman AlbertHakim is based on evidence collected before the three defendantsgave congressional testimony last year.   ``Defendants involvement in the activities underlying theindictment had been fully identified prior to any of theirimmunized testimony,'' said the prosecution brief filed in U.S.District Court.   ``The government, in short, had no need for any imunizedtestimony to focus or aid its investigation,'' said the pleadingfiled by Herbert J. Stern, a former federal judge who was hired torepresent the independent counsel on the immunity issue.   The prosecution opposed the motion by the three defendants todismiss the indictment on the the ground that the criminal chargesviolated their Fifth Amendment protection againstself-incrimination.   The three, along with retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard V.Secord, are accused of conspiring to illegally divert profits fromthe U.S.-Iran arms sales to the Nicaraguan rebels.   Secord, the lead witness at last year's congressional hearings,gave his testimony on Capitol Hill without limited immunity.   Under the so-called ``use immunity'' granted by Congress, Walshis prohibited from using the congressional testimony of North,Poindexter and Hakim as evidence against them.   But Stern argued that the immunity restriction does not apply tostatements any of the defendants made voluntarily to the House andSenate Iran-Contra committees. Such statements are distinguishedfrom compelled testimony given in response to questions, Stern said.   But the prosecution offered to forgo introduction of suchstatements by the three defendants as evidence if U.S. DistrictJudge Gerhard A. Gesell agrees not to hold an extensive pre-trialhearing on the immunity issue.   Stern called the defense request for a ``massive, multi-month''hearing an attempt ``to use pre-trial proceedings to delay theirtrial by jury and obtain unparalleled discovery in a criminalcase.''   The prosecution proposed to submit for Gesell's review``sufficient evidence _ documents and witness interviews allcollected or requested before the immunized testimony _ todemonstate that it is not unfair to place the defendants on trial.''   Before Walsh began his investigation early last year, hereceived information from the presidential commission thatinvestigated the U.S.-Iran arms sales, the House and Senateintelligence committees and the Justice Department, which hadconducted a preliminary inquiry that led to his appointment asindependent counsel, Stern said.   Attached as an exhibit was a December, 1986 memo to Swissauthorities by then-Assistant Attorney General William Weld seekingSwitzerland's cooperation in obtaining records of the arms dealsfrom bank accounts kept by Hakim and Secord.   The memo states that the Justice Department had alreadydetermined that an undetermined amount of the proceeds from thearms sales were not accounted for.   Weld also identifed conspiracy to defraud the government andwire fraud as possible offenses committed by Hakim, North andSecord. The indictment accuses all four defendants with committingthose offenses.   Gesell is scheduled to hold a hearing next Tuesday on theimmunity issue. He indicated in a brief opinion earlier this weekthat he was prepared to discuss a ``realistic trial date.''</TEXT></DOC>
