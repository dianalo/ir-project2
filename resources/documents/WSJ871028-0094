An agenda for further talks has been agreed on, he said, and a report on those negotiations will be made Dec. 11 at a regular EC-U.S. meeting in Brussels.    U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said it was &quot;unlikely&quot; that McDonnell Douglas Corp. and Boeing Co. would act now on their threat to file an unfair-trade-practice complaint against Airbus.    In Seattle yesterday, Boeing welcomed the agreement &quot;to negotiate the issues of Airbus subsidies and trade disciplines within a fixed timetable for resolution.&quot; In St. Louis, a McDonnell Douglas spokesman said that while the company welcomed the talks, it won't rule out filing an unfair-trade-practice complaint against Airbus until it sees what comes out of the negotiations.    Airbus is a consortium of Aerospatiale of France, Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm G.m.b.H. of West Germany, British Aerospace PLC and Construciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain.    Yesterday's meeting of trade ministers was the latest in almost two years of meetings about U.S. complaints that Airbus has unfair competitive advantages because of its big subsidies. </TEXT></DOC>
