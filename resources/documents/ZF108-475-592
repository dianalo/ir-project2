Reiger Road, Baton Rouge, LA70809-4559; (800) 873-4384 or (504) 291-7221.andP;  Version: 4.0.andP;  List Price:$39.95.andM;After DarkandM;Published by: Berkeley Systems, 1700 Shattuck Ave., Berkeley, CA 94709; (415)540-5535.andP;  Version: 1.1.andP;  List Price: $39.95.andM;The two leaders of the screen-saver pack are After Dark and Pyro!, and newversions of both have just been released.andP;  Both offer numerous modules, soyour idle screen can be as exciting or as busy as you want.andP;  Both areexcellent utilities.andM;AFTER DARKandM;After Dark was the first screen saver to use drop-in modules that allow youto pick what appears when your screen is idle.andP;  The current version comeswith 18 modules.andM;New modules are being released on MAUG (the Mac area of CompuServe).andP;  As ofpress time, there was an After Dark version of the Moire screen saver and ofShredded Crystals.andM;PYRO! 4.0andM;Early versions of Pyro! had only its trademark fireworks and a clock.andP;  Thecurrent version has 12 modules, and you can select as many of them as youwant.andP;  Each time it engages, it displays a different module, although you canspecify one to be the primary module.andP;  The first additional Pyro! module,Flashlight, is being finished as this review goes to press.andM;THE VERDICTandM;The external appearance and effects of these two programs are more alike thendifferent.andP;  You control both Pyro! and After Dark via the Control Panel.andO;After Dark takes about 50K to start up and then an average of 8K after that,depending on which module you're using.andP;  Pyro! uses up 38K of memory.andP;  Bothsets of controls are intelligent and nicely done, but Pyro! has betteroptions for engaging and disengaging.andP;  Both have manuals that are clearenough for beginners and complete enough for experienced users.andP;  The AfterDark manual contains information for programmers who want to develop theirown modules, and both programs come with a folder of development examples.andM;Each program has an option for locking the screen with a password when theprogram becomes active.andP;  I'm not a fan of such slight protection, but it'sonly an option, not a mandatory feature.andP;  And some people really like it.andM;The extensive features lists that both programs sport bring up the questionof whether you really need so many features and choices in a screen saver.andO;After all, these aren't productivity tools, and the modules don't addanything except choices and variety.andM;The current version of After Dark has behaved reliably.andP;  The previous versionof Pyro! was rock steady, and this version seems equally stable.andP;  Pyro!andO;handles background tasks better than After Dark, and that's important if youdo a lot of printing or downloading of data from other computers.andP;  Pyro! canautomatically switch to simpler modules when the background load is heavy.andM;You can probably run both Pyro! and After Dark at the same time, but thatisn't a good practice.andP;  If one is set to activate before the other, you'lljust be wasting disk space with the one that never gets used.andP;  If both areset to activate at the same time, the results are unpredictable and couldprove undesirable.andM;THE BOTTOM LINEandM;You won't go wrong with either of these utilities.andP;  After Dark has moremodules, but with the exception of Puzzle, I prefer Pyro!'s modules.andP;  Theyare more interesting visually.andP;  Pyro!'s Aquarium, which is a bit of a memoryhog, is the best of all the modules, and Pyro! has better control options.andM;I've never had any problems with Pyro! and have experienced onlyinsignificant difficulties with the new version of After Dark.andP;  If you haveversion 1.0 of After Dark, you can obtain a slick free upgrade package fromuser groups, BBSs, and national on-line services.andP;  Pyro! upgrades cost $ 15from the publisher.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
