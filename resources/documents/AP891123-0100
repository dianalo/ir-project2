STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PRAGUE, Czechoslovakia (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 300,000 people jammedWenceslas Square on Thursday to demand democratic reforms, cappinga week of unprecedented protest, but the military warned it standsready ``to defend the achievements of socialism.''   Vaclav Havel, the nation's leading dissident, told the largestrally yet to assemble in Prague: ``We will never return to the oldsystem of totalitarian rule.''   Alexander Dubcek, the ousted crusader for reform, addressed tensof thousands at an anti-government rally in Bratislava, hishometown and the nation's second-largest city, the state CTK newsagency said.   The highly popular Dubcek led the ``Prague Spring'' reformmovement, which was crushed by a Soviet-led invasion in 1968.   In an apparent reference to those events, he called for arenewal of society but warned protesters against making extremedemands that could have ``tragic consequences.''   Also Thursday, a top Communist official said the ruling partywould discuss personnel changes in the leadership at a meeting ofthe of the Central Committee on Friday. In seven days of protests,demands have mounted for the resignation of the hard-lineleadership.   Havel called on the nation's military and police forces ``tostand by the people for the first time.''   But the military issued an entirely different message.   In a statement carried by CTK, it said: ``We reject the anarchyspread by anti-socialist forces from within and abroad. We activelysupport the efforts of the Central Committee, the federalgovernment and the majority of our working people.''   It added it was ``prepared to defend the achievements ofsocialism.''   Among the top military leaders said to have endorsed thestatement was Defense Minister Milan Vaclavik.   Earlier, Communist Party chief Milos Jakes hinted he would notsuppress the demonstrations. He told a delegation of party andtrade union officials and coal miners the leadership ``will usepolitical means to halt the negative development in society,'' CTKreported.   Havel also told the crowd Thursday that ``we will never give upour ideal of a free, democratic and prosperous Czechoslovakia nomatter what happens.''   Taking aim at the Communist leadership, Havel said: ``We shallsee whether our country will reach democracy in a political way orwhether an isolated group of sadists will prevail, who want, at anycost, to hide their power and privileges by empty words aboutreform.''   The crowd responded by shouting ``Resign!'' and ``Shame!''   In addition to Prague and Bratislava, state media said therewere anti-government protests Thursday in the cities of Usci NadLabem, with 12,000 demonstrators; Plzen, which had 30,000; HradecKralove with several thousand; Ostrava with 3,000; and EanskaEystrica with 5,000.   Another activist, the Rev. Vaclav Maly, told the crowd that 500businesses had expressed support for the opposition's call for awork stoppage on Monday.   Dubcek had been expected to speak at the Prague rally, butstayed in Bratislava.   Although some members of the ruling party have appeared anxiousto end the growing unrest by meeting with opposition and churchleaders, there are indications of a major rift within the party onhow to handle the biggest challenge to the government since 1968.   Security police Thursday ordered top officials of the nation'sstate-controlled TV not to broadcast live footage of the rally.Police were posted at the station's central news office, said anemployee who spoke on condition of anonymity.   On Wednesday, state TV did show footage of the protest that drew200,000, but it was abruptly cut off after a worker interviewed onthe square accused the government of ``lying to us for 20 years.''   In East Germany, where similar protests have triggeredsubstantial reforms, an official newspaper Thursday denounced EastGermany's role in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia and said itshould now help its neighbor achieve change.   In an open letter published in this week's Moscow News,prominent Soviet writer Daniil Granin apologized for the invasion,calling it ``illegal, ruinous intervention'' that brought to power``dogmatic Stalinists.''   Czechoslovak media carried a statement by the Prague section ofthe official national youth organization calling for an inquiry``by the highest party and state organs concerning people fullyresponsible for the present situation.''   The statement also called for an immediate parliament session todiscuss the growing unrest and demanded the debate be carried onlive TV.   Meanwhile, a group of young party members in a Prague policeunit demanded ``necessary personnel changes'' in the rulingPolitburo to ``restore the effectiveness of the party.''   Their statement, published in the youth organization's dailyMlada Fronta, said confidence in the party had dwindled.   The Communist leadership has rejected the kinds of reforms nowsweeping Hungary, Poland and East Germany.   Communist leaders have denounced the protest rallies asanti-socialist.   The daily mass rallies began after police brutally broke up apeaceful student protest Nov. 17.   Protesters have alleged that a mathematics student was killed bypolice during the rally. The government denies that.   CTK reported that Sweden's foreign minister, Sten Andersson,postponed a visit Friday during which he planned to award Havel theOlof Palme Prize for public service. The news agency did not give areason or new date.</TEXT></DOC>
