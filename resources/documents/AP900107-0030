Alex Medberry at the Tsunami Warning Center in Palmer said the 2a.m. quake was centered 40 miles northwest of here.   Charlotte Row of the Alaska Earthquake Information Center placedthe Richter scale reading at 5 and said said several smallaftershocks followed. An earlier estimate put the Richter scalereading at 5.5.   The quake was felt in the small towns surrounding Fairbanks andas far away as Clear, 80 miles south, she said.   The Richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded onseismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increasein magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 timesstronger than one of 6.5.   An earthquake of 3.5 on the Richter scale can cause slightdamage in a local area, 4 can cause moderate damage, 5 considerabledamage, and 6 can be severe.</TEXT></DOC>
