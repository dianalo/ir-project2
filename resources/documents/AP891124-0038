(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   High up the 220-foot Harkness Toweroverlooking the Yale campus, workmen are hoping to put the ringback in one of the country's largest carillons in time forChristmas.   The Yale Memorial Carillon has been quiet since July, whendozens of bronze clappers _ some weighing as much as 300 pounds _were removed and taken away for refurbishing.   The repairs will give the 54 bells that make up the carillon acrisper, clearer tone.   Two intrepid workers from the Verdin Co. of Cincinnati returnedto the tower this month to begin replacing the restored clappersand reconnect them to a clavier two levels below. They hope to befinished by mid-December.   The Guild of University Carillonneurs, a student organization,is responsible for playing the bells daily at noon and 5:30 p.m.   Harkness Tower, a medieval-looking stone building topped byturrets and pinnacles, was dedicated in 1922 with a chimeconsisting of 10 bells _ part of the gift honoring the memory ofCharles William Harkness, a member of the Yale class of 1883. Thebells were cast by a firm of bellfounders in Loughborough, England,which traces its history back to the 14th century.</TEXT></DOC>
