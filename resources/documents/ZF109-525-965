Unruh said at the announcement here.andM;The architecture on which the IIE is based consists of five sets ofinterfaces and services across platforms, including Unisys proprietary andopen systems.andM;In view of the federal government's move toward open environments, the Unisysapproach will mesh well with the government's needs, Unruh said.andP;  &quot;We thinkthe Unisys approach is complementary to and consistent with what thegovernment direction will be and is today,&quot; he said.andM;&quot;The federal government has been trying to get vendors to move toward opensystems for a long time,&quot; said Thomas Murphy, director of the TechnicalSupport Department at the Naval Computer and Telecommunications Station inNewport, R.I.andM;'Best for the Money'andM;Murphy, who is also president of Use Inc., a Unisys users group that includesmany federal agencies, said the move will make it &quot;easier to get the bestsolution for the money.&quot;andM;The announcement is particularly welcome because most federal agencies have avariety of computer equipment that must interconnect.andP;  &quot;We have so manydifferent [types of computer equipment].andP;  We would like them to worktogether, and we would like to be able to go out and buy the best solutionfor the money and not have to worry about what it works with or how itworks,&quot; Murphy said.andM;Freedom to ChooseandM;Unruh said open systems has become a philosophy for Unisys.andP;  &quot;Our view of thefuture is based on the recognition that organizations today are demanding thefreedom and flexibility to choose the best solutions regardless of who thevendors are for solving individual computing problems.andP;  They want to beassured their systems will work together to form a cohesive, accessibleinformation network,&quot; Unruh said.andM;The Unisys architecture will help users build connected, distributedenvironments by using a common standards-based environment across diversehardware and software through the use of application programming interfacesand common application development tools, said Unisys spokesman Mike Stugrin.andM;This announcement &quot;is what the government has been asking the vendors to do,and I'm glad that this vendor is doing it,&quot; Murphy said.andM;&quot;For an organization like Unisys to come out with its overall plan of howthey are not only going to protect our investments but move us into the opensystems world is great,&quot; he said.andM;Unruh said the architecture depends on three classes of services, each withdifferent capabilities.andM;Open-class services conform to identified formal standards such as StructuredQuery Language and Open Systems Interconnection to achieve multivendorinteroperability and portability.andP;  An application relying strictly onopen-class services should be executable on any of the Unisysarchitecture-specified computing platforms supporting those standards withoutchanges in the source code or user interface, Stugrin said.andM;Premium-class services go above and beyond industry standards.andP;  For example,they might include development of robust, open, on-line transactionprocessing.andM;Complementary-class services include Unisys' level of Systems NetworkArchitecture connectivity.andM;Levels of ConnectionsandM;Five sets of software services specified under the IIE architecture eachinclude application programming interfaces and correspond to desired levelsof interoperability across heterogeneous distributed computing environments,basic communications connectivity, distributed network services, distributeddatabases, distributed applications and management of the distributed networkat each of the levels of interoperability.andM;The five services are:andM;* Application and information services for designing, integrating,implementing and maintaining applications as well as providing a consistentend-user interface.andM;* Information management services for providing secure storage, retrieval andsharing of information throughout the organization.andM;* Distributed system services for satisfying information distribution andresource-sharing needs, both internal and external.andM;* System connectivity services for transmitting data, text, graphics, imageand voice information.andM;* Systems management services for defining, implementing and enforcingoperational policies and procedures that manage, control, monitor andsafeguard information.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
