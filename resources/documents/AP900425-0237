The widening from $2.3 billion in February sent the poundplummeting and prompted the Bank of England to intervene to supportthe British currency.   The government blamed the shortfall largely on higher imports ofoil and of erratic items such as civil aircraft and preciousmetals. Imports hit a record during the latest month.   The pound fell to $1.6265 by about noon local time from $1.6345just before the trade report was released.   The Bank of England intervened to support the pound by sellingdollars, sources familiar with the intervention said. The Bank ofEngland declined to comment on the reported intervention, as is itspractice.   ``It was pretty disastrous numbers,'' said Jeff Earnshaw, deputyhead of foreign exchange trading at Natwest Moneycenter. He saidthe bad trade news could easily spark a prolonged slide in sterling.   A Treasury spokesman, who wasn't identified, in accordance withBritish practice, said: ``The deterioration is almost entirely theresult of higher imports, not lower exports.''   But dealers said the news could seriously shake the financialmarkets' recent confidence that the country's trade position wasimproving.   The current account deficit also soared to $3.6 billion from$2.3 billion, the Central Statistical Office said.   The current account deficit equals the merchandise trade deficitplus so-called invisible trade, such as services, overseasinvestment earnings and official transfer payments.   The markets had expected deficits of $2.2 billion.   The statistical office said the deficits were the second worseon record after a $3.9 billion merchandise trade gap and a $3.8billion current account shortfall in August 1989.   Exports totaled $13.6 billion in March, down from $13.7 billionin February. Imports totaled a record $17.2 billion in March, upfrom $16 billion.   Since the beginning of the year, the merchandise trade deficithas grown to $9.1 billion, compared with a shortfall of $9.8billion a year earlier.</TEXT></DOC>
