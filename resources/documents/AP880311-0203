(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Federal aviation officials on Fridayunveiled a regional air traffic control center's new computersystem, part of a $197 million nationwide system they say willimprove air safety even though it will be replaced within 12 years.   Published suggestions that the new computers already areoutdated are ``very, very misleading'' because the agency wantedcomputers with proven reliability, not the newest models available,said Ed Harris, an associate administrator of the Federal AviationAdministration.   ``We would have been crazy to gamble on a system that wasunproven,'' Harris said before the dedication of the new computersat the Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center.   The center, in Palmdale about 50 miles north of downtown LosAngeles, controls instrument flight operations in 177,000 squaremiles of airspace over Southern and Central California, southernNevada, southwestern Utah, northwestern Arizona and the PacificOcean out to 250 miles off California's coast.   Attention has been focused on the region's heavy mix ofcommercial and general aviation aircraft since a small plane flewinto restricted airspace over suburban Cerritos and collided withan Aeromexico jet on Aug. 31, 1986, killing 82 people. Cerritos is20 miles southeast of the airport.   Since the crash, several reviews of FAA records indicated itsradar and tracking network was a jumble of different computers andoutdated electronics, many of which were inoperable or down forrepairs a considerable amount of time.   The Los Angeles center is the 13th of 20 FAA traffic controlcenters nationally to activate the new computer system, made byInternational Business Machines Corp.   But the FAA will start replacing the new computers _ as well asdisplay screens and other equipment used by controllers _ with ahighly advanced, $2 billion to $4 billion nationwide system by1995, and intends to complete installation by the end of 1999, saidWilliam Carson Jr. of IBM.   Thousands of IBM 3083s like the ones unveiled Friday were soldto banks and businesses until IBM stopped making them last year,Carson said.   Computer technology ``is advancing so quickly that if you waitedfor state-of-the-art, you'd never buy anything,'' said Nobby Owens,an FAA deputy associate administrator. ``The old (IBM 9020) systemwas at capacity. The reliability of this (IBM 3083) equipmentoffers use exactly what we want.''   FAA spokeswoman Elly Brekke said IBM 3083 computers already havebeen activated at traffic control centers in Oakland, Calif., whichcovers the San Francisco Bay area; Seattle; Houston; Denver;Boston; Washington; Chicago; Albuquerque, N.M.; Memphis, Tenn.;Cleveland; Atlanta; and Miami.   Scheduled to get the computers by mid-year are centers in NewYork City; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Mo.; Indianapolis;Jacksonville, Fla.; Fort Worth, Texas, including the Dallas area;and Salt Lake City, she said.   ``The new IBM mainframe computers are up to 10 times faster andhave four to five times the storage capacity of the equipment theywill replace,'' FAA Administrator T. Allan McArtor said in aprepared statement.   ``This will allow the air traffic control system to keep pacewith projected traffic growth over the next decade and accomodatethe introduction of new automation functions that will both enhancesafety and increase controller productivity,'' he added.   The Los Angeles center's system was activated March 1, but wasformally dedicated Friday by H.C. ``Mac'' McClure, FAA regionaldirector.   The IBM 3083s will be equipped with conflict-alert programs togive controllers flashing warnings if two planes start to get tooclose, even if one of the planes isn't under a controller'sjurisdiction, Owens said, adding other software will help improvetraffic flow.   The 600-employee center in Palmdale handled about 1.9 millionflights last year and is the fifth busiest in the nation.   The FAA said the new computers are only one aspect of its $12billion, 20-year modernization plan, which also will include newlanding systems, better radars and a major upgrading of weatherreports for pilots. Fourteen percent of the modernization projecthas been completed nationwide, with 70 percent of the work undercontract.</TEXT></DOC>
