The new Communist Party Politburo has a ``striking generationdifference'' from the one headed by Janos Kadar, replaced as partyleader after 32 years in power, said Imre Pozsgay.   Pozsgay was appointed to the Politburo at last month's nationalparty conference.   He has called for dialogues with independent political groupsand in the intervew said more pluralism should accompany economicreforms.   ``That pluralism exists in socialism (communist society) is .. .an indisputable fact of life,'' he said in an interview with theCommunist Party daily Nepszabadsag.   Reszo Nyers, also elected to the Politburo last month, said inan interview with the government newspaper Magyar Hirlap that itwas of ``serious political importance,'' that people ``enter orre-enter the leadership who carry no direct responsibility for theeconomic policy and general policy of the past 10-15 years.''   Nyers the planner of Hungary's economic reforms in the late1960s, was ousted from the Politburo in 1973 after apparentlypushing too hard for more changes.   Eight elderly Politburo members, including Kadar, 76, were sweptfrom power at the party conference, reducing the average age of the11-member ruling body to 52.   The interviews were published two days after police broke up ademonstration in Budapest by Hungarians calling for therehabilitation of Imre Nagy, the leader during the 1956 revolt.Nagy and many of his associates were executed in 1958. Soviettroops put down the uprising.   Pozsgay and Nyers did not mention the revolt in the interviews,but Pozsgay said Hungarian history had to be reviewed factually allthe way back to 1945. The premier and new Communist Party leader,Karoly Grosz, said last week he would appoint Pozsgay to head aspecial committee to review Hungary's history of the past 15 to 20years and take a long-term look at the coming 20 years.   In a related development, Magyar Hirlap reported Saturday thatauthorities had assured organizers of the Thursday demonstrationthat there would be no interference as long as the protesters werenot anti-regime.   The article was the first detailed official account of eventsdealing with the Nagy demonstration.   Magyar Hirlap said authorities had contacted organizers inadvance and told them no steps would be taken to disturb ``theirexpression of their respect toward the dead.''   The newspaper said a memorial event at a Budapest cemetery whereNagy is believed to be buried was held ``without any disturbance ofpublic order'' by some 400 people.   But it said 15 people were detained during the afternoondemonstration in downtown Budapest and were released by 10 p.m.   Witnesses had reported, however, that some 400 peopled moved onto the Hungarian television building where they were dispersed byriot police with truncheons.</TEXT></DOC>
