The Canadian Union of Postal Workers, which represents 23,000 members, last Wednesday began rotating strikes to support its contract demands in negotiations with Canada Post Corp., the government-owned postal agency.    The union suspended strike activity over the weekend, but its 3,000 Montreal members continued their work stoppage, which is unauthorized by union leaders.    A union spokeswoman said more strikes may be called for today; she refused to elaborate. Talks broke off Thursday night between the union and Canada Post. The major unresolved issue concerns Canada Post's plan to franchise some of its operations, a move the union says would eliminate 4,200 jobs.    Mr. Cadieux has said the two sides are still too far apart to benefit from mediation.    Over the weekend, a subcommittee met to negotiate grievance procedures, arbitration and discipline, but there weren't any plans to resume the primary negotiations. </TEXT></DOC>
