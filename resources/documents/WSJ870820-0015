The weaker dollar helped to trigger a further fall in bond prices that sent yields on many long-term U.S. Treasury issues above 9%. In the stock market, a last-hour buying spree wiped out some early dollar-related losses, and the Dow Jones Industrial Averaged finished at 2665.82, up 11.16 points.    In late New York trading yesterday, the U.S. currency stood at 143.85 Japanese yen, a 1.7% decline from 146.35 a day earlier, and 1.8305 West German marks, or 0.7% lower than its level of 1.8437 marks late Monday. The British pound rose 0.5% to $1.6220 from $1.6140 the day before.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 144.05 yen.    As on previous days, the dollar's decline began in the Far East, where the widened U.S. trade deficit for June &quot;keeps affecting the market,&quot; Haruhiko Aoyama, an assistant general manager for Japan's Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York, said. The U.S. reported Friday a much larger-than-expected $15.71 billion deficit for June.    The dollar was basically steady in European trading yesterday, but it then fell further in the U.S. market.    &quot;Everybody sold dollars in the Tokyo market, especially institutional investors for hedging purposes,&quot; Yasuhiro Kawate, chief trader for the Industrial Bank of Japan in New York, said. Japan's big life insurance companies and trust banks are large holders of dollar-denominated securities. Mr. Kawate also said there was continued pressure from Japanese exporters seeking to sell dollars.    The Bank of Japan intervened in Tokyo when the dollar fell to 144.77, buying as much as $200 million of the U.S. currency, traders said. The purchases temporarily halted the dollar's decline. But Mr. Aoyama of Dai-Ichi Kangyo described the transactions as &quot;a kind of gesture&quot; and not enough to really alter market sentiment. A senior trader at a big London bank called the Bank of Japan's effort &quot;chicken feed.&quot;    Dealers said that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York also bought dollars in the U.S. market but that its moderate transactions were made on behalf of Japan's central bank.    &quot;If the Bank of Japan thinks this trend is a real (downward) trend for the dollar, it may intervene more significantly,&quot; Mr. Aoyama said. &quot;But they aren't so confident the dollar's fall will continue.&quot; Other analysts said the Japanese central bank probably was reluctant to try to stem any dollar decline by itself, having failed to do so in the past.    As is its custom, the New York Fed declined to comment.    Carmine J. Rotondo, chief corporate dealer for Security Pacific International Bank in New York, said many traders yesterday hoped the Fed would intervene to prop the dollar up, &quot;so they could sell at appropriate levels and make a profit.&quot;    The Bank of Japan's reported intervention contrasted with statements made by the Japanese and West German finance ministers.    Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's finance minister, was quoted as telling Japan's Jiji news service that the exchange rate is &quot;better left alone.&quot; He also told Japan's Parliament that the dollar's latest drop reflected a &quot;general market phase&quot; and that it &quot;isn't a big move, though there are many different views about recent movements in the yen-dollar exchange rate.&quot;    At a Bonn news conference, West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called the dollar's recent fluctuations &quot;limited moves&quot; that don't endanger the six-month-old effort by major industrial countries to stabilize exchange rates.    Both officials' comments prompted dealers to keep selling dollars because they were taken to mean that &quot;everybody is content with the dollar moving lower,&quot; Mr. Rotondo said.    &quot;The bearish sentiment in the market is still very strong,&quot; Mr. Kawate of Industrial Bank of Japan said. Jean-Jacques Rideau, a senior vice president in New York for Britain's Midland Bank, said many multinational corporations continued to dump dollars yesterday.    &quot;People are getting out of long (or overbought dollar) positions; they're scared the move could go further,&quot; he said.    After Friday's U.S. trade results, currency dealers who analyze fundamental economic data soured on the dollar. Others turned negative after the U.S. currency plunged past several critical points on charts that traders use to predict currency movements, Robert Hatcher, a vice president at Barclays Bank in New York, said.    &quot;So you had the fundamentalists and technicians both pulling in the same direction, and we were off to the races with a lower dollar,&quot; Mr. Hatcher said.    Mr. Rotondo said market expectations now are for a still wider U.S. trade deficit of $15.5 billion to $16 billion when the July data are reported in mid-September.    &quot;People in the market are just selling dollars; they don't think it will improve,&quot; he said.    Adding to the pessimism, dealers said, was a reassessment of the dollar's strength by many Japanese money managers and analysts who returned from summer vacations Monday.    Mr. Hatcher predicted that &quot;the market will begin to grope for the low side (of the dollar's range) as well as (at what level) central banks are concerned.&quot; But he said he doesn't think the market will expect concerted action by central banks until the dollar reaches 1.80 marks.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for delivery this month fell 30 cents an ounce to $458.30. Estimated volume was light to moderate at 2.8 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $457.45 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                   LATE NEW YORK TRADING                  Wednesday, Aug. 19, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
