Perry   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>03/21/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A20</SO><GV>CONGRESS (CNG)JUSTICE DEPARTMENT (JUS)</GV><LP>   WASHINGTON -- Ready on the right, ready on the left; allready on the firing line. It's time once again for nervousmembers of Congress to vote on gun-control legislation.   The big shoot-out is over a proposal to create a seven-daywaiting period for the purchase of handguns, and supportersthink this is the year they're finally going to win.</LP><TEXT>   The bill establishing the waiting period is named forJames Brady, confined to a wheelchair since he was shot inthe head by John Hinckley a decade ago.   Hearings on the Brady bill will begin today, highlighedonce again by testimony from Mr. Brady, who was serving asPresident Reagan's press secretary when he was seriouslywounded. The bill is being pushed by Handgun Control Inc., a300,000member organization headed by Mr. Brady's wife, Sarah.   Opposing the bill is the National Rifle Association andits 2.5 million members. The NRA supports alternativelegislation that would create an instant &quot;hotline&quot; computercheck by gun dealers on prospective handgun purchasersinstead of a week-long waiting period. The NRA argues that aseven-day waiting period unfairly penalizes legitimate gunbuyers.   NRA ads, with actor Charlton Heston promoting theinstant-check system, are being aired now on the Cable NewsNetwork. Handgun Control expects to begin running its ownads, featuring Jim and Sarah Brady urging passage of theirbill, on CNN later this week.   It is a furious struggle between two organizations that goout of their way to reward their friends and penalize theirenemies. That leaves many fence-straddling members ofCongress exposed, fearful of risking retaliation for makingthe wrong move.   &quot;It's looking awfully good,&quot; says Sarah Brady. &quot;Theviolence never goes away. It keeps getting worse. We'relosing kids. We're losing people day after day. Something hasto be done now.&quot;   &quot;The Congress is coming around,&quot; says Democratic Rep.Edward Feighan of Ohio, sponsor of the Brady bill. &quot;We'regoing to see encouraging support from members coming over toour side from the NRA.&quot; Earlier this week, in fact, Rep. LesAuCoin (D., Ore.), announced he was changing sides, tosupport the Brady bill.   Even Rep. Harley Staggers (D., W.Va.), sponsor of theNRA-backed bill to establish the handgun hotline, concedesthe forces supporting a waiting period have gained ground inthe past two years. &quot;People just believe we should be doingsomething about criminals getting guns. And the waitingperiod, simplistic as it is, makes sense to them.&quot;   If the Brady provisions pass the House, Senateconsideration will focus on a freestanding bill introduced bySen. Howard Metzenbaum. The Brady provisions aren't includedin either President Bush's crime bill or one being preparedby Judiciary Committee Chairman Joseph Biden (D., Del.); thepresident has never stated his position on the Brady bill.   A Gallup poll reported in September last year that 95% ofits respondents supported a national law requiring a sevendaywaiting period before a handgun could be purchased, up from91% two years earlier. &quot;You can't find any other public issuewith that much public support,&quot; says Gail Hoffman, HandgunControl's legislative director. In fact, say Gallup pollanalysts, &quot;nationwide support for gun control is at thehighest levels recorded by the Gallup poll since the early1970s.&quot;   But the NRA refuses to back down. The Brady bill, it saysin notices to its members, &quot;will have its greatest impact onthe Second Amendment rights of law-abiding citizens {to beararms}, not crime or criminals.&quot; Mr. Staggers's NRA-backedbill would require gun dealers to make a toll-free call to adata bank run by the Justice Department to check thebackgrounds of gun purchasers. &quot;That's disingenuous,&quot; saysRep. Feighan. &quot;We know we don't have the federal and localdata bases to do the job, and we don't have the money to payfor such a system.&quot;   In 1988, NRA-backed forces defeated the Brady bill bypassing an amendment calling on the attorney general todevelop a system to identify felons and others barred by lawfrom buying firearms from legitimate dealers. The vote tostrip the Brady provisions from the bill was 228-182.   Attorney General Dick Thornburgh concluded that turning upa felon's prior record &quot;would be hit-or-miss because we arebehind the times in keeping modern, up-todate convictionfiles at our electronic fingertips.&quot;   Mrs. Brady argues that only 10 states have computerizedrecords to make such a program work and that three states --Maine, Mississippi and West Virginia -- have no automatedcriminal-history information at all.   &quot;We're talking about something that doesn't exist,&quot; shesays.   James Jay Baker, the NRA's chief lobbyist, concedes that&quot;the system, at the outset, is not going to be perfect.&quot; But,he says, with an outlay of about $12 million, the FBI couldfully automate its felony-conviction records.   Actually, says Mr. Baker, the NRA isn't overwhelmed bywhat an instant check on prospective gun purchasers mightultimately accomplish, even if it does support the concept.&quot;More than 80% of felons purchasing guns avoid going tolegitimate dealers to buy them,&quot; says Mr. Baker. &quot;And if theydo deal with legitimate gun dealers, they use a straw man tomake the purchase. The only real answer is punishing peoplewho misuse guns.&quot;   The Brady bill came up again last year, but House SpeakerTom Foley (D., Wash.) blocked it from reaching the floor (hehas promised a vote early this year). The focus then shiftedto another emotional gun issue -- a proposed ban on thedomestic manufacture and sale of so-called assault weapons,which followed a ban by President Bush on the importation ofcertain such weapons. The NRA won that one, too, by backingan amendment offered by liberal Rep. Jolene Unsoeld (D.,Wash.). Her amendment allowed domestic production of theweapons to continue.   What happened then underlines why so many members ofCongress are reluctant to become closely involved in gunissues, and why casting a vote on these issues can be soperilous.   Because she had stepped forward with the amendment, Mrs.Unsoeld became the NRA's favorite politician, even if she hada reputation as a strict environmentalist. The NRA pumped$52,892 into her tough re-election campaign in directcontributions and in independent expenditures in her behalf,far and away the most the gun lobby spent in any campaign. Inradio ads, the NRA said, &quot;Jolene Unsoeld has had the courageto join with Tom Foley and oppose the East Coast anti-gunlobby.&quot;   Handgun Control responded with $18,587 of radio adsblasting Mrs. Unsoeld as &quot;someone . . . who sells out to aspecial interest for money.&quot; It was far and away the mostmoney Handgun Control spent in any campaign last year.   The NRA won that battle, too. Mrs. Unsoeld was re-electedwith 54% of the vote. In this year's big battle over handgunpurchases, her press secretary, Doug Levy, says, &quot;She favorsinstant identification&quot;in other words, the Staggers billbacked by the NRA.</TEXT></DOC>
