The National Association of Latino Elected and AppointedOfficials said the number of Hispanic elected officials increasedby 1.3 percent this year, based on elections from August 1987 toAugust 1988.   Harry Pachon, national director of the association, saidmeasuring the number of Hispanic elected officials ``is a goodbarometer of Hispanic progress in the political arena.'' Theassociation is a non-partisan, non-profit research organizationwith more than 3,300 members.   President Reagan on Tuesday proclaimed this week as NationalHispanic Heritage Week, saying people of Hispanic descent have``written countless chapters in the unique saga of the UnitedStates.''   Most of the Hispanic elected officials hold municipal and schoolboard seats. Association researcher Luis Baquedano said a breakdownof party membership was not available because many local officialsdo not run as Democrats or Republicans.   The association said the largest gains were made in theSouthwest, with Texas accounting for 1,611 of the elected officialsand New Mexico coming in second with 595. Texas has the nation'ssecond-largest Hispanic population, with 4.1 million of thenation's estimated 19.4 million Hispanics.   California, with the country's largest Hispanic population at6.6 million, had 466 Hispanic elected officials.   New York, with a third-ranked Hispanic population of 2.1million, had 68 elected Latino leaders, fewer than states withsmaller Hispanic populations such as Arizona, with 237 electedofficials, and Colorado with 157.   Other states with double-digit numbers of elected Hispanics wereFlorida, 50; New Jersey, 44; Illinois, 28; Connecticut, 15; andWashington, 12.
