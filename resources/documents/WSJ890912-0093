Mr. Kohl's re-election as party chairman by a vote of 571-147, with 20 abstentions, was expected. Nevertheless, the chancellor's comfortable victory margin -- and the generally positive atmosphere toward him at the convention -- showed his ability to bounce back from adversity. Winning 77% of the votes cast, he nearly matched his 80.8% tally in 1987. Mr. Kohl has been elected CDU chairman nine times since 1973.    Whether he can lead his party to re-election a third time in the national elections scheduled 15 months from now hangs chiefly on the party's ability to combat the recent popularity of the right-wing Republican Party. But Mr. Kohl emerges from the party convention in far better shape than a few months ago. Thus, many political forecasts caution it is too early to count out the politically crafty chancellor. </TEXT></DOC>
