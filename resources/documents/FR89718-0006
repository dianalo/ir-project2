Executive Summary</ITAG>The Commission is adopting proposed Rule 15a-6 to provide conditional exemptionsfrom broker-dealer registration for foreign broker-dealers that engagein certain activities involving U.S. investors and securities markets.These activities include (i) ``nondirect'' contacts by foreign broker-dealerswith U.S. investors and markets, through execution of unsolicited securitiestransactions, and provision of research to certain U.S. institutional investors;and (ii) ``direct'' contacts, involving the execution of transactions througha registered broker-dealer intermediary with or for certain U.S. institutionalinvestors, and without this intermediary with or for registered broker-dealers,banks acting in a broker or dealer capacity, certain international organizations,foreign persons temporarily present in the United States, U.S. citizensresident abroad, and foreign branches and agencies of U.S. persons. TheCommission's goals in adopting Rule 15a-6 at this time are (i) to facilitateaccess to foreign markets by U.S. institutional investors through foreignbroker-dealers and the research that they provide, consistent with maintainingthe safeguards afforded by broker-dealer registration; and (ii) to provideclear guidance to foreign broker-dealers seeking to operate in compliancewith U.S. broker-dealer registration requirements.In addition, the Commission is withdrawing the interpretive statement thatit proposed together with Rule 15a-6. The final rule (``Rule'') includesexemptions incorporating many of the positions originally set forth inthe proposed interpretive statement. The Commission has included in thisrelease a discussion of the purposes and scope of broker-dealer regulationand the general principles of U.S. registration for international broker-dealers,in order to emphasize the importance that the Commission attaches to broker-dealerregistration and regulation in the international context.Finally, the Commission has issued a separate release discussing the conceptof an exemption from broker-dealer registration based on recognition offoreign regulation. Many commenters addressing the proposed rule favoredthis approach, but the Commission believes that the numerous complex issuesraised by this approach require further exploration before any action istaken on the concept. To clarify the application of U.S. broker-dealerregistration requirements to the cross-border activities of foreign broker-dealers,the Commission is adopting the Rule now, while soliciting more detailedcomments on the parameters of the concept of an exemption from broker-dealerregistration based on recognition of foreign securities regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Introduction</ITAG>Rule 15a-6 is based on the Commission's recognition of the fact that thepace of internationalization in securities markets around the world continuesto accelerate.\1\<NOTE/> As the Commission noted when it published Rule 15a-6 forcomment,\2\<NOTE/> multinational offerings of securities have become frequent,\3\<NOTE/> and linkages are developing between secondary markets \4\<NOTE/> and clearing systems.\5\<NOTE/> The desire of investors to trade in financial markets aroundthe world is increasing steadily, and many major institutional investors,particularly investment companies, insurance companies, pension funds,and large commercial banks, are active on an international basis.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ In its recent <T3>Policy Statement on Regulation of International Securities Markets,</T3>the Commission outlined its views on the appropriate regulatory responseto this development, which it broadly described as facilitating efficientand honest markets where investors and issuers can seek the greatest returnon investment and the lowest cost of capital, without regard for nationalboundaries.

Many U.S.and foreign broker-dealers are developing an international securities business,establishing offices throughout the world.\7\<NOTE/> According to statistics compiled by the Commission's Officeof Economic Analysis, 179 registered U.S. broker-dealers were affiliatedwith foreign broker-dealers or foreign banks as of 1987. In contrast, in1973 there were approximately twenty-eight non-Canadian U.S. broker-dealerswith foreign parents.\8\<NOTE/> As of 1988, there were approximately fifty members of theNew York Stock Exchange in which foreign entities had an ownership interest.In 1973, there were four.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ One commentator recently estimated that approximatelythirty broker-dealers will possess the integrated back-office trading andmanagement information systems necessary to execute and clear securitiestransactions on a global basis by the year 2000.

This release had two purposes.First, as discussed at greater length below, the Commission sought to makeknown the existing U.S. requirements for registration of foreign broker-dealers.Second, the Commission sought to facilitate investment by U.S. institutionalinvestors in foreign securities markets by proposing a rule that wouldincrease access to foreign broker-dealers, consistent with the investorsafeguards afforded by broker-dealer regulation. The Commission recognizedthat foreign broker-dealers can provide valuable market experience, tradeexecution, and research services to U.S. institutions interested in enteringoverseas markets.Release 34-25801 comprised an interpretive statement and a proposed rule.The interpretive statement was a summary of the staff's current positionsregarding broker-dealer registration by foreign entities. Proposed Rule15a-6, developed from past interpretive, no-action, and exemptive positions,would have exempted from the broker-dealer registration requirements ofsection 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Exchange Act'')\10\<NOTE/> foreign broker-dealers that engaged in securities transactionswith certain non-U.S. persons or with specified U.S. institutional investorsunder limited conditions.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3> (a).Subsequently, members of the Committee on Federal Regulation of Securitiesof the Section of Business Law of the American Bar Association (``ABA'')submitted a comment letter suggesting an expanded version of proposed Rule15a-6, which generally reflected the substance of the interpretive statement.The ABA suggested that an expanded rule, among other things, would ``spellout clearly in one place the ground rules to which foreign broker-dealersare subject'' and be ``more consistent with orderly development of thelaw in this area.'' \11\<NOTE/> Believing that expansion of proposed Rule 15a-6 to includeadditional portions of the interpretive statement deserved ``serious consideration,''the Commission solicited comment on an expanded rule.\12\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Letter from John M.

Broker-Dealer Regulation</ITAG>A. Purposes and Scope of Broker-Dealer RegulationIn the context of adopting exemptions from the U.S. broker-dealer regulatoryscheme, the Commission believes that it is important to reiterate the fundamentalsignificance of broker-dealer registration within the structure of U.S.securities market regulation. Because of the broker-dealer's role as anintermediary between customers and the securities markets, broker-dealershave been required to register with the Commission since 1935,\14\<NOTE/> and they were registered with numerous states before enactmentof the Exchange Act in 1934.\15\<NOTE/> The definitions in the Exchange Act of the terms ``broker''\16\<NOTE/> and ``dealer'' \17\<NOTE/> and the registration requirements of section 15(a) of theExchange Act \18\<NOTE/> were drawn broadly by Congress to encompass a wide rangeof activities involving investors and securities markets.\19\<NOTE/> Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act generally requires thatany broker or dealer using the mails or any means or instrumentality ofinterstate commerce (referred to as the jurisdictional means) \20\<NOTE/> to induce or effect transactions in securities \21\<NOTE/> must register as a broker-dealer with the Commission.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\14\ As originally enacted, the Exchange Act dealt primarilywith exchange regulation, and section 15 of the Exchange Act authorizedthe Commission to provide, by rule, for registration of brokers or dealersthat were not already exchange members. After the Commission initiallyadopted rules requiring registration of over-the-counter broker-dealers,Congress in 1936 amended section 15 to codify the Commission's rules onbroker-dealer registration. <T3>See</T3> L. Loss, <T3>Fundamentals of Securities Regulation</T3> 409-10 (1988) and the conceptrelease also issued today, <T3>infra</T3> note 34.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\15\ <T3>See generally</T3> L. Loss andamp; E. Cowett, <T3>Blue Sky Law</T3> 26-30 (1958).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\16\ Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act defines ``broker''as ``any person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securitiesfor the account of others, but does not include a bank.'' 15 U.S.C.  78c(a)(4). The term ``bank,'' however, is limited by section 3(a)(6) of theExchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6), to banks directly regulated by U.S.state or federal bank regulators, and thus foreign banks that act as brokersor dealers within the jurisdiction of the United States are subject toU.S. broker-dealer registration requirements. <T3>See</T3> Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23645 n.1. To the extent, however,that a foreign bank establishes a branch or agency in the United Statesthat is supervised and examined by a federal or state banking authorityand otherwise meets the requirements of section 3(a)(6), the Commissionwould consider this branch or agency to be a ``bank'' for purposes of sections3(a)(4) and 3(a)(5) of the Exchange Act.<ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission believes that the determination whether any particularfinancial institution meets the requirements of section 3(a)(6) is theresponsibility of the financial institution and its counsel. </ITAG><T3>Cf.</T3> Securities Act Release No. 6661 (Sept. 23, 1986), 51 FR 34460(``Release 33-6661'') (determination as to whether branch or agency offoreign bank falls within the definition of ``bank'' under section 3(a)(2)of Securities Act of 1933 (``Securities Act''), 15 U.S.C. 77c(a)(2), isresponsibility of issuers and their counsel). The Commission notes, however,that section 4(d) of the International Banking Act, 12 U.S.C. 3102(d),expressly prohibits agencies of foreign banks established under federallaw from receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary powers, criteria necessaryfor qualification as a bank under section 3(a)(6)(C). <T3>See Conference of State Bank Supervisors </T3>v. <T3>Conover,</T3> 715 F.2d 604 (D.C.

It also should be noted that the definition of bankunder section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act differs somewhat from the definitionof bank under section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act, particularly withrespect to exercising fiduciary powers and receiving deposits. As discussed<T3>infra</T3> note 168, the Securities Act definition is applicable indetermining whether U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks qualifyas U.S. institutional investors under the Rule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\17\ Section 3(a)(5) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(5),defines ``dealer'' as ``any person engaged in the business of buying andselling securities for his own account, through a broker or otherwise,but does not include a bank, or any person insofar as he buys and sellssecurities for his own account, either individually or in some fiduciarycapacity, but not as a part of a regular business.'' Although by its termsthis definition is broad, it has been interpreted to exclude various activitiesnot within the intent of the definition, such as buying and selling forinvestment. <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> Letter from Robert L.D. Colby, Chief Counsel, Divisionof Market Regulation, SEC, to Elizabeth J. Tolmach, Esq., Caplin andamp;Drysdale (Apr. 2, 1987) (United Savings Association of Texas) (no-actionposition on government securities dealer registration).

This is also true for foreign issuersusing their employees to sell securities within the United States. However,the Commission has adopted Rule 3a4-1, 17 CFR 240.3a4-1, which providesa safe-harbor exemption from broker-dealer registration for an issuer'spersonnel selling the issuer's securities under certain circumstances.<T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 22172 (June 27, 1985),50 FR 27940.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\20\ Specifically, section 15(a)(1), 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>(a)(1), refers to ``use of the mails or any means or instrumentalityof interstate commerce to effect any transactions in, or to induce or attemptto induce the purchase or sale of, any security (other than an exemptedsecurity or commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, or commercial bills)* * * .'' Given the broad definition of ``interstate commerce'' in section3(a)(17) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(17), which includes ``trade,commerce, transportation, or communication * * * between any foreign countryand any State,'' virtually any transaction-oriented contact between a foreignbroker-dealer and the U.S. securities markets or a U.S. investor in theUnited States involves interstate commerce and could provide the jurisdictionalbasis for broker-dealer registration.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\21\ Section 15(a) does not require registration for transactionsin exempted securities, which are defined in section 3(a)(12) of the ExchangeAct, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(12), commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, andcommercial bills. 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>(a)(1). The Canadian Bankers, Association asked the Commissionto clarify that the U.S. broker-dealer registration requirements do notapply to transactions in U.S. commercial paper by Canadian banks in theU.S. market. Commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, and commercial billsare not defined in the Exchange Act. Nonetheless, the Commission notesthat the definition of ``security'' in section 3(a)(10) of the ExchangeAct, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10), generally is understood to exclude instrumentsexempt from registration under section 3(a)(3) of the Securities Act, 15U.S.C. 77c(a)(3), by virtue of their classification as commercial paper.<T3>See</T3> Securities Exchange Act Release No. 4412 (Sept. 20, 1961)[1957-61 Transfer Binder], Fed.

These considerations remain important regardless of whether a broker-dealer'sactivities involve contacts with individual or institutional investors.When Congress authorized and subsequently required the Commission to registerbroker-dealers, Congress did not condition the requirement for registrationon the type of investor involved. In 1975, Congress amended section 15(a)to extend the broker-dealer registration requirements to all broker-dealerstrading exclusively on a national securities exchange or in municipal securities.\3\\3\<NOTE/> Moreover, as noted in the concept release issued today,\3\\4\<NOTE/> Congress recently reaffirmed the importance of regulatingsecurities professionals who operated in a largely institutional marketby enacting the Government Securities Act of 1986.\3\\5\<NOTE/> Congress enacted this legislation to remedy serious problems,including a depositors' run on savings and loan associations and savingsbanks that resulted in the temporary closing of seventy-one of those financialinstitutions, that had developed in a primarily institutional market duein part to inadequate regulation of the professional intermediaries inthat market.\3\\6\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\\3\ Securities Act Amendments of 1975, Pub.

General Principles of U.S. Registration for International Broker-DealersBefore discussing the exemptions in the Rule, it is useful to review thegeneral principles governing U.S. registration of brokers and dealers engagingin international activities.\3\\7\<NOTE/> The definitions of ``broker'' \3\\8\<NOTE/> and ``dealer'' \3\\9\<NOTE/> do not refer to nationality, and the scope of these definitionsincludes both domestic and foreign persons \4\\0\<NOTE/> performing the activities described therein.

They asserted that readingsection 30(b) to protect only foreign broker-dealers not using the U.S.jurisdictional means to effect, induce, or attempt to induce any transactionsin securities with or for U.S. persons would render the section meaningless,on the grounds that foreign broker-dealers avoiding this use of the U.S.jurisdictional means would not be subject to the requirements of section15(a) in the first place. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28">The Commission's position on the application of section 30(b) historicallyhas been, and continues to be, that the phrase ``without the jurisdictionof the United States'' in that section does not refer to the territoriallimits of this country. </ITAG><T3>See, e.g., </T3>Securities and Exchange Commission, <T3>Brief Amicus Curiae on Rehearing by the Full Court, Schoenbaum v.

In particular, directed selling efforts toU.S. investors in the United States hardly could be considered activitiesnot traversing the U.S. territorial limits. A broker-dealer operating outsidethe physical boundaries of the United States, but using the U.S. mails,wires, or telephone lines to trade securities with U.S. persons locatedin this country, would not be, in the words of section 30(b), ``transact[ing]a business in securities without the jurisdiction of the United States.''<ITAG tagnum="81">1.

Under this approach, if a foreign broker-dealer physicallyoperates a branch in the United States, and thus becomes subject to U.S.registration requirements, the registration requirements and the regulatorysystem governing U.S. broker-dealers would apply to the entire foreignbroker-dealer entity. If the foreign broker-dealer establishes an affiliatein the United States, however, only the affiliate must be registered asa broker-dealer; the foreign broker-dealer parent would not be requiredto register.\44\<NOTE/> Under this arrangement, absent exemptions, only the registeredU.S. affiliate would be authorized to trade with any person in the UnitedStates or perform securities functions on behalf of those customers, suchas effecting trades, extending credit, maintaining records and issuingconfirmations, and receiving, delivering, and safeguarding funds and securities.\45\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\44\ Similarly, only the affiliate's personnel must be licensedappropriately by the NASD or another SRO. <T3>See</T3> sections 3(a)(18) and 15(c)(8) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.78c(a)(18) and 78<T3>o</T3>(c)(8).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\45\ <T3>See</T3> note 189 <T3>infra</T3> regarding whether a registered broker-dealer would be permittedto function as an introducing broker to an unregistered foreign broker-dealer.Some commenters questioned whether, under these principles, a registeredbroker-dealer's personnel who are stationed outside the United States witha foreign broker-dealer may contact U.S. and foreign persons located inthe United States on behalf of the registered broker-dealer, provided thatthese personnel are U.S.-registered and subject to U.S. regulatory supervision.\46\<NOTE/> Assuming these persons were subject to the registered broker-dealer'ssupervision and control \47\<NOTE/> and satisfied all U.S. SRO qualification standards,\48\<NOTE/> the Commission believes that it is consistent with theseprinciples for a registered broker-dealer's registered representative stationedoutside the United States with a foreign broker-dealer to contact personsin the United States from within or without this country on behalf of theregistered broker-dealer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\46\ The Securities Industry Association (``SIA'') and MerrillLynch andamp; Co., Inc.

Most U.S. citizensresiding abroad typically would not expect, in choosing to deal with foreignbroker-dealers, that these foreign broker-dealers would be subject to U.S.registration requirements. Nor would foreign broker-dealers solicitingU.S. citizens resident abroad normally expect that they would be coveredby U.S. broker-dealer requirements, since they generally would not be directingtheir sales efforts toward groups of U.S. nationals. To make clear thatregistration is not required of foreign broker-dealers dealing with U.S.persons resident abroad, including branches and agencies of U.S. personslocated abroad, the Commission has included in the Rule a specific exemptionfor these foreign broker-dealers, as discussed in greater detail below.The Commission historically has taken the view, however, that foreign broker-dealersspecifically targeting identifiable groups of U.S. persons resident abroad,<T3>e.g.</T3>, U.S. military and embassy personnel, could be subject toU.S. broker-dealer registration requirements.\51\<NOTE/> This position is reflected in the exemption.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\51\ <T3>See</T3> Release 34-4708 (a public offering of securities specificallydirected toward U.S. citizens abroad, such as military personnel, wouldbe regarded as subject to Securities Act registration); <T3>SEC v.

By ``targeting,'' the Commissionmeans selling efforts intentionally directed toward identifiable groupsof U.S. citizens resident abroad.<ITAG tagnum="81">3. Solicitation</ITAG>The proposed interpretive statement explained that if a transaction witha person in the United States is solicited, the broker-dealer effectingthe transaction must be registered.\52\<NOTE/> Although the requirements of section 15(a) do not distinguishbetween solicited and unsolicited transactions, the Commission does notbelieve, as a policy matter, that registration is necessary if U.S. investorshave sought out foreign broker-dealers outside the United States and initiatedtransactions in foreign securities markets entirely of their own accord.In that event, U.S. investors would have taken the initiative to tradeoutside the United States with foreign broker-dealers that are not conductingactivities within this country. Consequently, the U.S. investors wouldhave little reason to expect these foreign broker-dealers to be subjectto U.S. broker-dealer requirements. Moreover, requiring a foreign broker-dealerto register as a broker-dealer with the Commission because of unsolicitedtrades with U.S. persons could cause that foreign broker-dealer to refuseto deal with U.S. persons under any circumstances.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\52\ <T3>See</T3> Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23646; <T3>see also</T3> Report on Internationalization at V-42.As noted in the proposed interpretive statement,\53\<NOTE/> however, the Commission generally views ``solicitation,''in the context of broker-dealer regulation,\54\<NOTE/> as including any affirmative effort by a broker or dealerintended to induce transactional business for the broker-dealer or itsaffiliates.\55\<NOTE/> Solicitation includes efforts to induce a single transactionor to develop an ongoing securities business relationship. Conduct deemedto be solicitation includes telephone calls from a broker-dealer to a customerencouraging use of the broker-dealer to effect transactions, as well asadvertising one's function as a broker or a market maker in newspapersor periodicals of general circulation in the United States or on any radioor television station whose broadcasting is directed into the United States.Similarly, conducting investment seminars for U.S. investors, whether ornot the seminars are hosted by a registered U.S. broker-dealer, would constitutesolicitation.\56\<NOTE/> A broker-dealer also would solicit customers by, among otherthings, recommending the purchase or sale of particular securities, withthe anticipation that the customer will execute the recommended trade throughthe broker-dealer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\53\ Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23650.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\54\ Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act requires registrationof brokers and dealers that effect securities transactions or ``induce<T3>or attempt to induce</T3> the purchase or sale of, any security.''15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>(a)(1) (emphasis added). If a foreign broker-dealer's securitiesactivities brought it within the definitions of ``broker'' or ``dealer''in section 3(a) (4) or (5), using the U.S. jurisdictional means to solicittrades from U.S. customers would be sufficient to trigger the registrationrequirements of section 15(a).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\55\ The Report on Internationalization said that ``[k]eyto the issue of solicitation is whether the foreign broker-dealer's contactswith U.S. markets reasonably may be viewed as attempting to induce an investor'spurchase or sale of a security.''

The staffnonetheless has given assurances that enforcement action would not be recommendedfor lack of broker-dealer registration with respect to the collective distributionby organized foreign exchanges of foreign market makers' quotes, in theabsence of other inducements to trade on the part of these market makers.\63\<NOTE/> Several commenters discussed an exemption in the Rule forthe collective distribution of foreign broker-dealers' quotations. TheABA suggested exempting from registration foreign broker-dealers that actedas market makers and provided their names, addresses, telephone numbers,and quotes as part of the collective distribution by a ``recognized foreignsecurities market'' of foreign market makers' quotes.\64\<NOTE/> Members of the Securities Law Committee of the Chicago BarAssociation (``CBA'') concurred. Sullivan andamp; Cromwell maintained thatthe fact-specific nature of these arrangements rendered them more suitablefor resolution by the staff through no-action or interpretive procedures.The Public Securities Association (``PSA'') suggested that, if a foreignbroker-dealer participated in a third-party quotation system ``principallydirected at foreign persons,'' dissemination of its quotations to U.S.institutional investors should not be considered solicitation of thoseinvestors, provided that the foreign broker-dealer did not engage in otheractivities in the United States requiring broker-dealer registration.\65\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\61\ <T3>See</T3> Part IV.B.<T3> infra.</T3> The Commission also has created an exemption in the directcontact provisions of the Rule to permit associated persons of foreignbroker-dealers to make visits to U.S. institutional investors under limitedconditions.

The Commissionrecognizes that access to foreign market makers' quotations is of considerableinterest to registered broker-dealers and institutional investors, whoseek timely information on foreign market conditions.\6\\6\<NOTE/> The Commission's position, however, would apply only to third-partysystems that did not allow securities transactions to be executed betweenthe foreign broker-dealer and persons in the United States through thesystems. In addition, foreign broker-dealers whose quotes were distributedthrough the systems would not be allowed to initiate contacts with U.S.persons, beyond those exempted under the Rule, without registration orfurther exemptive rulemaking. The Commission believes that questions regardingthe future development of third-party quotation systems with internal executioncapabilities designed, for example, to facilitate cross-border tradingin securities while the domestic markets for those securities are closed,should be addressed under present circumstances by the staff on a case-by-casebasis or by the Commission in further rulemaking proceedings. The Commissionalso believes that the <T3>direct</T3> dissemination of a foreign market maker's quotations toU.S. investors, such as through a private quote system controlled by aforeign broker-dealer, would not be appropriate without registration, becausethe dissemination of these quotations would be a direct, exclusive inducementto trade with that foreign broker-dealer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\\6\ The Commission would have reservations, however, aboutcertain specialized quotation systems, which might constitute a more powerfulinducement to effect trades because of the nature of the proposed transactions.For example, a foreign broker-dealer whose quotations were displayed ina system that disseminated quotes only for large block trades might wellbe deemed to have engaged in solicitation requiring broker-dealer registration,as opposed to a foreign broker-dealer whose quotes were displayed in asystem that disseminated the quotes of numerous foreign dealers or marketmakers in the same security. <ITAG tagnum="81">4.

Recognition of Foreign Securities Regulation </ITAG>The third prong of the Commission's approach is represented by the ConceptRelease on recognition of foreign securities regulation also issued today.In the proposed interpretive statement, the Commission noted that the developmentof comprehensive broker-dealer regulation in foreign nations suggestedthat agreements with foreign securities authorities as to some form ofrecognition of foreign broker-dealer regulation might be possible in thefuture. Under this conceptual approach, a country could recognize regulationof a foreign broker-dealer by the latter's home country as a substitute,to some extent, for its own domestic regulation. The Commission pointedout, however, that this approach ``could raise the possibility of reducedU.S. investor protection, unless the foreign jurisdiction had a broker-dealerregulatory system that was comparable and compatible with that of the UnitedStates, this system was comprehensively enforced, and ready cooperationin surveillance and enforcement matters between the United States and theforeign jurisdiction was the norm.'' \7\\2\<NOTE/> In light of these factors, the Commission stated that itwas weighing whether some degree of mutual recognition of internationalbroker-dealers might be possible in the future. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\2\ Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23652. Seventeen commenters favored some form of mutual recognition.\7\\3\<NOTE/> Several of these commenters advocated permitting a foreignbroker-dealer to deal directly with U.S. institutional investors afterthe Commission made a formal determination that its home country's broker-dealerregulatory regime was adequate,\7\\4\<NOTE/> particularly if there were a satisfactory information-sharingand mutual cooperation agreement between U.S. and foreign regulators.\7\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\3\ Andras Research Capital Inc., Bank of America, BrownBrothers Harriman, Fidelity Investments, National Companies and SecuritiesCommission (Australia) (``NCSC''), Ross andamp; Hardies, CREF, Stikeman,Elliott, Westpac Banking Corporation, The Toronto Stock Exchange, the Instituteof International Bankers, the SIA, James Capel andamp; Co., Debevoise andamp;Plimpton, the Vancouver Stock Exchange, the NYSBA, and The Montreal Exchange.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\4\ Westpac Banking Corporation, the Institute of InternationalBankers, James Capel, and Debevoise andamp; Plimpton. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\\5\ The SIA advocated that the Commission require participatingforeign regulators to accord U.S. broker-dealers ``national treatment,''<T3>i.e., </T3>treatment similar to that accorded to domestic broker-dealersin the foreign country. The comments indicate great interest by U.S. institutional investors andforeign market professionals and securities authorities in an exemptionfrom broker-dealer registration based on recognition of foreign regulation.The many complex issues inherent in this approach require careful deliberationby the Commission and foreign securities authorities before the parametersof this exemption could be defined sufficiently to realize the desiredgoals of increased access to foreign markets by U.S. institutional investors,and more efficient regulation of the cross-border activities of foreignbroker-dealers, without resulting in reduced protection for U.S. investorsand securities markets. Therefore, the Commission has decided to adoptthe Rule at the present time, in light of the increasing cross-border activitiesof foreign broker-dealers and the need for clarification of the applicationof the U.S. broker-dealer registration requirements to these activities,while also soliciting specific comment on a conceptual approach based onrecognition of foreign securities regulation. <ITAG tagnum="81">3. Withdrawal of Proposed Interpretive Statement </ITAG>In view of its other actions, the Commission considers it unnecessary topublish separately a final interpretive statement. The Rule as adoptedincludes exemptions incorporating many of the positions originally setforth in the proposed interpretive statement, and this release specificallydiscusses others, especially in connection with the general principlesstated above. To avoid confusion, the Commission is withdrawing the proposedinterpretive statement, but the staff's interpretive and no-action lettersand the Commission exemptions cited therein will remain valid until expresslymodified or withdrawn. In addition, the Commission wishes to confirm thatthe staff's guidance will continue to remain available regarding both theapplication of the Rule and the general application of the U.S. broker-dealerregistration requirements to the activities of foreign broker-dealers.\76\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\76\ Questions on this subject should be addressed to theOffice of Chief Counsel, Division of Market Regulation, Securities andExchange Commission, 450 Fifth St. NW., Mail Stop 5-1, Washington, DC 20549,(202) 272-2848. B. Rule 15a-6 The Commission is adopting proposed Rule 15a-6 under section 15(a)(2) ofthe Exchange Act \77\<NOTE/> to provide conditional exemptions from broker-dealer registrationfor foreign broker-dealers that do not initiate direct contacts with U.S.persons, that solicit or effect transactions by certain U.S. institutionalinvestors through registered broker-dealers, or that solicit or effectsecurities transactions by certain other persons. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\77\ 15 U.S.C. 70<T3>o</T3>(a)(2). <ITAG tagnum="81">1. Structure of the Rule </ITAG>As previously noted, the Commission is adopting Rule 15a-6 in an expandedformat similar to that published in Release 34-26136. A majority of commentersthat addressed the issue supported expansion of the proposed exemptiverule to include the substance of the interpretive statement,\78\<NOTE/> and the Commission concurs with those comments suggestingthat an expanded rule would be understood more easily, especially by foreignersunfamiliar with the Commission interpretive practices. Therefore, Rule15a-6 as adopted incorporates many of the positions articulated in theinterpretive statement, although it differs in some respects from the expandedrule published in Release 34-26136. For ease of reference, the Rule hasbeen organized into nondirect contacts, direct contacts, and trading withor for specified persons. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\78\ Of the thirteen commenters who addressed the questionof whether the substance of the interpretive statement should be includedin the proposed rule, eleven supported expansion of the rule: ContinentalIllinois National Bank and Trust Company of Chicago, the PSA, The TorontoStock Exchange, the Institute of International Bankers, Chase ManhattanGovernment Securities, the SIA, Security Pacific Corporation, Salomon BrothersInc., Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, Merrill Lynch, and the CBA. The NYSBA, whilenot commenting explicitly on expansion of the proposed rule, suggestedthat in terpretive statement be ``converted into an interpretive rule''to provide foreign broker-dealers ``a clearer basis'' on which to evaluatethe application of U.S. law to their activities. Letter from Lauren D.Rachlin, Chairman, NYSBA, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (Nov. 7,1988), at 5. The Institute of International Bankers suggested that theCommission retain the proposed interpretive statement for discussion ofmatters not specifically addressed by the ABA's formulation of the proposedrule. The SIA, Security Pacific, Salomon Brothers, and Merrill Lynch believedthat the Commission should make clear that future requests for interpretiveguidance still would be considered after the adoption of the Rule. Onlythe PSA (which preferred the ABA's approach if the Commission adopted theRule) and The Montreal Exchange argued against an expanded rule, believingthat codification of interpretive positions on foreign broker-dealer registrationwould impair the staff's ability to exercise its judgment on this subjectin a flexible manner. Rule 15a-6(a) exempts only foreign brokers or dealers, which are definedin paragraph (b)(3) to mean persons not resident in the United States thatare not offices or branches of, or natural persons associated with, registeredbroker-dealers, and whose securities activities would fall within the definitionsof ``broker'' or ``dealer'' in sections 3(a)(4) or 3(a)(5) of the ExchangeAct, respectively.\79\<NOTE/> The definition in paragraph (b)(3) expressly includes anyU.S. person engaged in business as a broker or dealer entirely outsidethe United States. This definition also includes foreign banks to the extentthat they operate from outside the United States, but not their U.S. branchesor agencies.\80\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\79\ <T3>Supra </T3>notes 16-17. <T3>See also </T3>note 19 <T3>supra </T3>regarding Rule 3a4-1, 17 CFR 240.3a4-1. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\80\ The Institute of International Bankers contended thatU.S.-regulated branches or agencies of foreign banks should be excludedfrom broker-dealer registration in the same way as domestic banks, by virtueof section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6). As explainedin note 16 <T3>supra, </T3>the Commission has taken the position that the status ofthese branches and agencies under section 3(a)(6) is fact-specific, andU.S. branches or agencies of foreign banks that fall within the definitionof bank under section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act will be treated asU.S. institutional investors under the Rule. <T3>See also </T3>note 168 <T3>infra. </T3>The proposed rule would have exempted foreign broker-dealers only fromsection 15(a). The expanded rule also would have exempted foreign broker-dealersrequired to register as municipal securities dealers by section 15B(a)(1)of the Exchange Act,\81\<NOTE/> and several commenters believed that foreign broker-dealersrequired to register as government securities brokers or dealers by section15C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act\82\<NOTE/> should be included as well.\83\<NOTE/> Pursuant to section 15B(a)(4) of the Exchange Act,\84\<NOTE/> the Commission has made the exemptions in the Rule applicableto foreign broker-dealers engaging in municipal securities activities involvingU.S. investors, although the Commission believes that these activitiesare not likely to be extensive. In addition, the Commission will recommendto the Department of the Treasury that the latter exercise its authorityunder section 15C(a)(4) of the Exchange Act \85\<NOTE/> to provide similar exemptions to foreign broker-dealers engagingin government securities activities involving U.S. investors. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\81\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>-4(a)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\82\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>-5(a)(1). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\83\ The ABA, the PSA, and the CBA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\84\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>-4(a)(4). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\85\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>-5(a)(4).As proposed, Rule 15a-6(a) was phrased as a conditional exemption fromthe broker-dealer registration requirements of section 15(a).\86\<NOTE/> The expanded rule stated instead that a qualifying broker-dealer``is not subject to'' these registration requirements.\87\<NOTE/> Several commenters objected that an exemption implied thatthe exempted activities required registration absent the exemption.\88\<NOTE/> The Commission has determined to adopt Rule 15a-6 as an exemption,rather than as an exclusion from registration. In the Commission's view,many of the activities covered by provisions of the Rule plainly wouldrequire registration, absent an exemption. To keep the rule as simple aspossible, the Commission is adopting all the provisions of the Rule asexemptions from registration, pursuant to sections 15(a)(2) and 15B(a)(4)of the Exchange Act.\89\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\86\ <T3>See supra</T3> note 10.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\87\ Release 34-26136, 53 FR at 38968.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\88\ The ABA, Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, the PSA, and ContinentalBank.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\89\ <T3>See</T3> notes 77 and 84<T3> supra.</T3> Section (a) of the proposed rule also stated that therule applied to any foreign broker-dealer ``subject to the registrationrequirements of paragraph (1) of section 15(a) of the Act, because it inducesor attempts to induce the purchase or sale of any security by a U.S. person.''Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23655. This language has been deleted from theRule, because it merely restated the language of section 15(a)(1), 15 U.S.C.78<T3>o</T3>(a)(1). The exemption under Rule 15a-6 is necessary only if theregistration requirements of section 15(a) are triggered. As stated inPart IV.A. above, the staff's guidance will continue to be available onthis issue.Several commenters argued that failure to comply with the proposed rulein one instance should not affect the availability of the exemptions underthe proposed rule in other cases.\90\<NOTE/> The justifications proffered by these commenters were thedesire to avoid attaching ``unduly severe consequences'' to ``isolated,inadvertent violations'' \91\<NOTE/> and the belief that enforcement considerations did not prohibita transactional approach, since remedies are available to both the Commissionand private investors on a transactional basis.\92\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\90\ The PSA, Security Pacific Corporation, and Sullivan andamp;Cromwell.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\91\ Letter from Dan C.

Of course, the foreign broker-dealer would remain liablefor its violative conduct, even after it ceased all nonexempt U.S. securitiesactivities. Further, if a foreign broker-dealer repeatedly engaged in nonexemptU.S. securities activities intermittently with exempt U.S. activities,this course of conduct could support the conclusion that the foreign broker-dealerwas in violation of section 15(a) during the entire course of its U.S.activities.\94\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\93\ Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23651.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\94\ If a foreign broker-dealer deals with U.S. investorsin violation of the broker-dealer registration requirements, it would besubject to Commission enforcement action under section 15(a) of the ExchangeAct, <T3>supra</T3> note 10. Indeed, one commenter, even while recommendingchanges to proposed Rule 15a-16, exhorted the Commission, ``after spendingextensive efforts in developing a concise codification of interpretativeand exemptive positions which will inure to the benefit of all broker-dealers,domestic and foreign, [to] be prepared to demand appropriate compliancewith the registration requirements of the 1934 Act with respect to entitiesengaging in activity which requires registration and which is outside ofthe exemptions provided by proposed Rule 15a-16.''

Accordingly, paragraph(a)(1) of the Rule exempts from registration a foreign broker-dealer tothe extent that it ``effects transactions in securities with or for personsthat have not been solicited by the foreign broker or dealer.''

The expanded rule referred to ``execution'' of transactions,but ``effects'' is consistent with the express language of section 15(a)(1)of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>(a)(1). Also, the expanded rule referred to solicitation of ``customers''without defining them, but ``persons'' is preferable because of its definitionin section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange Act. <T3>See </T3>note 40 <T3>supra.</T3>The expanded rule did not define the concept of solicitation, and neitherdoes the Rule as adopted. The Commission's general views on meaning ofthe term ``solicitation'' have been discussed previously. Taking into accountthe expansive, fact-specific, and variable nature of this concept, theCommission believes that the question of solicitation is best addressedby the staff on a case-by-case basis, consistent with the principles elucidatedin this release.b. <T3>Provision of Research to U.S. Persons. </T3>As noted in the interpretivestatement,\9\\7\<NOTE/> the provision of research to investors also may constitutesolicitation by a broker or dealer. Broker-dealers often provide researchto customers on a nonfee basis, with the expectation that the customereventually will trade through the broker-dealer. They may provide researchto acquaint potential customers with their existence, to maintain customergoodwill, or to inform customers of their knowledge of specific companiesor markets, so that these customers will be encouraged to use their executionservices for that company or those markets. In each instance, the basicpurpose of providing the nonfee research is to generate transactional businessfor the broker-dealer. In the Commission's view, the deliberate transmissionof information, opinions, or recommendations to investors in the UnitedStates, whether directed at individuals or groups, could result in theconclusion that the foreign broker-dealer has solicited those investors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\7\ Release No. 25810, 53 FR at 23650-51.Consistent with earlier staff no-action positions,\9\\8\<NOTE/> however, the proposed interpretive statement took the positionthat the provision to U.S. persons of research reports prepared by a foreignbroker-dealer would not require broker-dealer registration by that foreignbroker-dealer, if the research reports were distributed to U.S. personsby an affiliated U.S. broker-dealer, if that affiliated broker-dealer prominentlystated on the research report that it had accepted responsibility for itscontent, if the research report prominently indicated that any U.S. personsreceiving the research and wishing to effect transactions in any securitydiscussed therein should do so with the U.S. affiliate, not the foreignbroker-dealer, and if transactions with U.S. persons in any securitiesidentified in the research actually were effected only with or throughthe U.S. affiliate, not the foreign broker-dealer.\9\\9\<NOTE/> This position was incorporated into paragraph (a)(3) of theexpanded rule in Release 34-26136, although the requirement for affiliationbetween the registered broker-dealer and the foreign broker-dealer wasdeleted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\8\ <T3>See </T3>Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23646-48.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\\9\ Article III, section 35(d)(2) of the NASD Rules ofFair Practice requires that all ``[a]dvertisements and sales literatureshall contain the name of the [NASD] member, [and of] the person or firmpreparing the material, if other than the member'' and that ``[s]tatisticaltables, charts, graphs or other illustrations used by members * * * shoulddisclose the source of the information if not prepared by the member.''<T3>NASD Manual </T3>(CCH) andpara; 2195 at 2177-78.

Under Rule 472.10(1),a ``communication'' includes ``market letters [and] research reports ** *.'' <T3>Id. </T3>at andpara; 2472.10(1). The Commission would not view an activitythat merely complied with these requirements, in itself, as solicitationby a foreign broker-dealer.Some commenters criticized this position on research as too restrictive.\1\\0\\0\<NOTE/> For example, Fidelity Investments claimed that, while theresearch that it receives from foreign broker-dealers is ``voluminous,''it plays ``only a very small part'' in the final investment decisions madeby its fund managers.\1\\0\\1\<NOTE/> The Madrid Stock Exchange argued that research distributedfree of charge in the United States by foreign broker-dealers to U.S. institutionalinvestors ``on a routine basis, for information purposes'' should not bedeemed solicitation of brokerage business.\1\\0\\2\<NOTE/> CREF agreed that any other position would impede the flowof foreign research to U.S. institutional investors.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\0\ <T3>See </T3>note 13 <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\1\ Letter from Fitzgerald to Katz, <T3>supra </T3>note 58, at 3.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\2\ Letter from Enrique Benito Rodriquez, Chairman,Madrid Stock Exchange, to Jonathan G. Katz, Secretary, SEC (Oct. 21, 1988),at 2.Dechert Price andamp; Rhoads, on behalf of five Spanish broker-dealers, arguedthat provision of research to existing U.S. institutional clients shouldnot be deemed solicitation, even if trades were effected for those clientsas a result.\1\\0\\3\<NOTE/> These foreign broker-dealers believed that it would be difficultfor them to screen out transactions from U.S. institutional investors thathave received their research. They maintained that it would be too costlyfor smaller foreign broker-dealers to establish U.S. affiliates to be responsiblefor and distribute their research and effect any resulting trades, andthat larger foreign broker-dealers thus would have a competitive advantage.The Association of German Banks also objected to the requirement that theU.S. affiliate prominently state that it had accepted responsibility fora research report prepared by a foreign broker-dealer. The SIA, while notobjecting to the proposed interpretive position on research itself, suggestedthat foreign broker-dealers should be allowed to send research directlyto U.S. institutional investors, as long as U.S. affiliates accepted responsibilityfor the research and effected any resulting trades.\1\\0\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\3\ CREF also said that communications between a foreignbroker-dealer and a U.S. investor after the investor had opened its accountwith the foreign broker-dealer on the investor's own initiative shouldnot be deemed solicitation. The Toronto and Vancouver Stock Exchanges agreed.The Commission believes, however, that the existence of these communicationscould support the conclusion that the foreign broker-dealer was engagedin the securities business within the jurisdiction of the United States,by virtue of having regular customers, and thus was subject to U.S. broker-dealerregistration requirements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\4\ While expressing general agreement with the discussionof research in the proposed interpretive statement, Sullivan andamp; Cromwellconcurred with the SIA on this point, as did the NYSBA and the ABA, althoughthe ABA did not suggest imposition of the execution condition explicitly.In publishing the proposed rule and interpretive statement, the Commissionwas motivated, in part, by the desire of U.S. institutional investors foraccess to foreign markets through foreign broker-dealers and the researchthat they provide. \1\\0\\5\<NOTE/> Accordingly, the Rule takes into account the comments onthe important role of research in facilitating access to these markets.The Commission does not wish to restrict major U.S. investors' abilityto obtain research reports of foreign origin if adequate regulatory safeguardsare present. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\5\ Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23648.Paragraph (a)(2) of the Rule therefore provides an exemption from registrationfor foreign broker-dealers that furnish research reports \1\\0\\6\<NOTE/> directly or indirectly \1\\0\\7\<NOTE/> to major U.S. institutional investors \1\\0\\8\<NOTE/> under certain conditions. The research report must not recommendthe use of the foreign broker-dealer to effect trades in any security,\1\\0\\9\<NOTE/> and the foreign broker-dealer must not initiate follow-upcontact with the major U.S. institutional investors receiving the research,or otherwise induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of any securityby those major U.S. institutional investors.\1\\1\\0\<NOTE/> If these conditions are met, the foreign broker-dealer mayeffect trades in the securities discussed in the research or other securitiesat the request of major U.S. institutional investors receiving the report.Under these conditions, the Commission believes that direct distributionwould be consistent with the free flow of information across national boundarieswithout raising substantial investor protection concerns.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\6\ Paragraph (a)(2) of the Rule would not distinguishbetween research reports provided in written or electronic form. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\7\ As adopted, paragraph (a)(2) is broader than theproposed interpretive statement in that, like the expanded rule, it permitsthe distribution of foreign research in this country directly by a foreignbroker-dealer. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\8\ Paragraph (b)(4) of the Rule defines ``major U.S.institutional investor'' as a U.S. institutional investor with assets,or assets under management, in excess of $l00 million, or a registeredinvestment adviser with assets under management in excess of $100 million.Paragraph (b)(7) of the Rule defines ``U.S. institutional investor'' asa registered investment company, bank, savings and loan association, insurancecompany, business development company, small business investment company,or employee benefit plan defined in Rule 501(a)(1) of Regulation D underthe Securities Act, 17 CFR 230.501(a)(1), a private business developmentcompany defined in Rule 501(a)(2), 17 CFR 230.501(a)(2), an organizationdescribed in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code, as definedin Rule 501(a)(3), 17 CFR 230.501(a)(3), or a trust defined in Rule 501(a)(7),17 CFR 230.501(a)(7). To determine the total assets of an investment companyunder the Rule, a registered investment company may include the assetsof any family of investment companies of which it is a part, and the term``family of investment companies'' is defined in paragraph (b)(1) of theRule.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\\9\ The Commission would not consider disclosure inthe research report that the foreign broker-dealer is a market maker ina security discussed in the report to violate this requirement. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\0\ If a foreign broker-dealer wished to initiate directcontact with U.S. persons, it could do so using the direct contact exemptionin paragraph (a)(3) of the Rule, and the conditions imposed by that exemption,including the participation of a registered broker-dealer intermediary,would address the investor protection concerns raised by those contacts.If, however, the foreign broker-dealer already had a relationship witha registered broker-dealer that facilitated compliance with the directcontact exemption in the Rule, the Rule would require all trades resultingfrom the provision of research to be effected through that registered broker-dealerpursuant to the provisions of that exemption. If the foreign broker-dealerhad entered into this prior relationship, the procedures for identifyingtrades from major U.S. institutional investors and routing them throughthe registered broker-dealer largely would have been established. Thus,the benefits of a registered broker-dealer's intermediation in effectingtrades would be provided without imposing substantial additional costs.Although this exemption is limited to major U.S. institutional investors,the Rule's research exemption is broader than either the proposed interpretivestatement or the expanded rule in that a registered broker-dealer wouldnot be required to take responsibility for the content of the report.\1\\1\\1\<NOTE/> In addressing the responsibilities of the U.S. affiliateunder paragraph (a) of the proposed rule, some commenters maintained thatthe registered broker-dealer's performance of supervisory responsibilitieswould result in little additional protection, at least with respect tosubstantial institutional investors.\1\\1\\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\1\ Of course, if a foreign broker-dealer, for its ownbusiness reasons, chose to distribute its research in the United Statesthrough a registered broker-dealer, affiliated or not, the SRO rules discussedin note 99 <T3>supra </T3>would require disclosure of the identity of the preparerof the research. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\2\ <T3>E.g.</T3>, Association of German Banks.By its terms, the exemption in paragraph (a)(2) of the Rule is availableonly with respect to research provided to major U.S. institutional investors.Therefore, the Commission has decided to retain the narrower position regardingthe distribution of research expressed in Release 34-25801 with respectto other investors.\1\\1\\3\<NOTE/> Under this position, the Commission would not require broker-dealerregistration by a foreign broker-dealer whose research reports were distributed\1\\1\\4\<NOTE/> to U.S. persons by a registered broker-dealer,\1\\1\\5\<NOTE/> if that broker-dealer prominently stated on the researchreport that it had accepted responsibility for its content,\1\\1\\6\<NOTE/> if the research report prominently indicated that any U.S.persons receiving the research and wishing to effect any transactions inany security discussed in the report should do so with the registered broker-dealer,not the foreign broker-dealer, and if transactions with U.S. recipientsof the report in any securities identified in the research actually wereeffected only with or through the registered broker-dealer, not the foreignbroker-dealer.

The Commission believesthat a registered broker-dealer would meet its responsibility under theRule if it took reasonable steps to satisfy itself regarding the key statementsin the research. In cases where there are no indications that the contentof the research is suspect, this responsibility can be fulfilled by reviewingthe research in question and comparing it with other public informationreadily available regarding the issuer, to make certain that neither thefacts nor the analysis appear inconsistent with outstanding informationregarding the issuer.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\\7\ <T3>See supra</T3> note 1.The Commission wishes to emphasize, however, that neither the exemptionnor this position regarding research is applicable with respect to ``soft-dollar''arrangements between foreign broker-dealers and U.S. persons.\118\<NOTE/> As discussed in the proposed interpretive statement,\119\<NOTE/> in many cases research is provided to customers with theexpress or implied understanding that the customers will pay for it bydirecting trades to the broker-dealer that result in an agreed-upon levelof commission dollars.\120\<NOTE/> These ``soft-dollar'' research arrangements are used widelyby broker-dealers both in the United States and abroad.\121\<NOTE/> If a foreign broker-dealer provided research to a U.S. investorpursuant to an express or implied understanding that the investor woulddirect a given amount of commission income to the foreign broker-dealer,the Commission would consider the foreign broker-dealer to have inducedpurchases and sales of securities, irrespective of whether the trades receivedfrom the investor related to the particular research that had been provided.Accordingly, both the exemption for research in paragraph (a)(2) and theposition retained from Release 34-25801 set forth above would be inapplicable.\122\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\118\ Paragraph (a)(2)(iv) of the exemption so provides. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\119\ Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23651.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\120\ <T3>See </T3>Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23646 n.16 and accompanying text. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\121\ For example, the Securities and Investments Board (``SIB'')notes in a recent discussion paper that soft-dollar arrangements in theUnited Kingdom have increased significantly at a time when the level ofbrokerage commissions generally has decreased.

In the Commission's view, it is desirable to broaden U.S. investors' accessto foreign sources of information through structures that maintain fundamentalinvestor protections. Accordingly, the Commission supports allowing directcontact between foreign broker-dealers and U.S. institutional investors,subject to requirements concerning these contacts and the execution oforders.\132\<NOTE/> The Rule as adopted allows a foreign broker-dealer to contactU.S. institutional investors if an associated person of a registered broker-dealerparticipates in each of these contacts.

(1) Comments on U.S. broker-dealer requirement. As proposed, Rule 15a-6would have provided an exemption from broker-dealer registration for foreignbroker-dealers that effected trades with certain U.S. institutional investorsthrough a registered broker-dealer.\135\<NOTE/> The foreign broker-dealer's personnel involved in contactswith U.S. institutional investors would have been subject to certain requirements,and the registered broker-dealer would have been responsible for supervisingthe contact and any resulting trades. If a trade was agreed upon, the rulewould have required the registered broker-dealer to effect the trade onbehalf of the investor, taking full responsibility for all aspects of thetrade. In proposing Rule 15a-6, the Commission stated that requiring theintermediation of a registered broker-dealer would maintain important regulatorysafeguards. The registered broker-dealer's responsibility for effectingall trades, combined with its recordkeeping and reporting duties pursuantto section 17 of the Exchange Act \136\<NOTE/> and the rules thereunder,\137\<NOTE/> ``would facilitate Commission review of this trading andalso subject this trading to the U.S. broker-dealer's supervisory responsibility.''\138\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\135\ Release 34-25801 did not make clear, however, whetherthe registered broker-dealer was required to be affiliated with the foreignbroker-dealer. <T3>See</T3> note 142 <T3>infra.</T3>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\136\ 15 U.S.C. 78q.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\137\ <T3>See</T3> note 28 <T3>supra.</T3>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\138\ Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23654.Fifteen commenters argued that the Commission should not require the participationof a registered broker-dealer affiliate in transactions with major institutionalinvestors.\139\<NOTE/> In particular, commenters asserted that U.S. institutionsmeeting the $100 million asset test in the proposed rule should be ableto be solicited by foreign broker-dealers and then transact business directlywith those broker-dealers, because requiring the intermediation of a registeredbroker-dealer would increase costs, impede the flow of foreign researchto U.S. institutions, and reduce the ability of these institutions to investin foreign markets in which local broker-dealers had not established registeredU.S. affiliates.\140\<NOTE/> Other commenters maintained that the Commission should grantan exemption from the registration requirements of section 15(a) to foreignbroker-dealers that deal only with institutional investors, on the groundsthat these investors can fend for themselves in the international securitiesmarkets.\141\<NOTE/> As discussed below in Part IV.B., however, the Commissionbelieves that not all the regulatory concerns raised by such an exemptionwould be alleviated by the institutional nature or size of these investors.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\139\ Andras Research Capital, Brown Brothers Harriman, FidelityInvestments, Madrid Stock Exchange, Ross andamp; Hardies, CREF, Dechert Priceandamp; Rhoads, Association of German Banks, Westpac Banking Corporation,Toronto Stock Exchange, Institute of International Bankers, Chase ManhattanGovernment Securities, the ABA, The Canadian Bankers' Association, andThe Montreal Exchange. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\140\ For example, the Toronto Stock Exchange believed thatthe costs of establishing a registered U.S. broker-dealer affiliate wouldbe significant.

Other commenters took a slightly different approach, suggesting that theregistered broker-dealer be allowed to delegate certain functions, butnot liability for performing them, to the foreign broker-dealer. Thus,these commenters would allow the registered broker-dealer to assume liabilityfor the acts and omissions of the foreign broker-dealer, rather than actuallyperforming the functions assigned to the registered broker-dealer by theproposed rule. They also opposed requiring the registered broker-dealerto maintain all books and records for U.S. institutional investors' accounts,claiming that the requirement in the rule for the foreign broker-dealerto provide the Commission, upon request, with information or documentswithin its possession, custody, or control would be an adequate substitute.The Commission has determined to continue to require the intermediationof a registered broker-dealer,\148\<NOTE/> to address concerns regarding financial responsibility andthe effective enforcement of U.S. securities laws. The Rule does not require,however, any affiliation between the foreign broker-dealer and the registeredbroker-dealer through ownership or control. This position, together withthe conditional eligibility of nonresident registered broker-dealers toserve as intermediary under the Rule,\149\<NOTE/> should reduce greatly the costs incurred by a foreign broker-dealerin establishing a relationship with a registered broker-dealer to complywith the conditions of the direct contact exemption. Accordingly, the Commissiondoes not believe that it is appropriate to allow the registered broker-dealerto delegate the performance of its duties under the Rule to the foreignbroker-dealer, with the exception of physically executing foreign securitiestrades in foreign markets or on foreign exchanges,\150\<NOTE/> and merely retain responsibility for errors or omissionsin their performance. With respect to the recordkeeping requirements inthe Rule, however, the Commission notes that it might be more efficientand less costly for the registered broker-dealer to handle data processingin a centralized fashion. As long as the registered broker-dealer has physicalpossession of all records required by the Rule, employing a third party,such as the foreign broker-dealer, to process these records mechanicallywould be permissible. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\148\ The Rule draws on the definition of ``U.S. broker ordealer'' in the expanded rule. Paragraph (b)(5) of the Rule defines theterm ``registered broker or dealer'' to include persons registered withthe Commission under sections 15(b), 15B(a)(2), or 15C(a)(2) of the ExchangeAct, 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>(b), 78<T3>o</T3>-4(a)(2), or 78<T3>o</T3>-5(a)(2), respectively. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\149\ The Rule permits a nonresident registered broker-dealerto serve as intermediary under the Rule, provided that the nonresidentbroker-dealer complies with Rule 17a-7(a), 17 CFR 240.17a-7(a). <T3>See </T3>Part IV.B. <T3>infra. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\150\ <T3>See infra </T3>note 185 and accompanying text.The Commission believes that the concerns expressed by commenters overthe proposed rule's imposition on the registered broker-dealer of supervisoryresponsibility concerning transactions under paragraph (a)(3) between theforeign broker-dealer and U.S. institutional investors or major U.S. institutionalinvestors are, to some extent, valid. Accordingly, the Commission wouldno longer take the position that the Rule requires the registered broker-dealerto implement procedures to obtain positive assurance that the foreign broker-dealeris operating in accordance with U.S. requirements.\151\<NOTE/> The Commission believes, however, that the registered broker-dealer,in effecting trades arranged by the foreign broker-dealer, has a responsibilityto review these trades for indications of possible violations of the federalsecurities laws. The registered broker-dealer's intermediation in thesetrades is intended to help protect U.S. investors and securities markets.The registered broker-dealer would have an obligation, as it has for allcustomer accounts, to review any Rule 15a-6 account for indications ofpotential problems.\152\<NOTE/> Moreover, if the registered broker-dealer ignores indicationsof irregularity that should alert the registered broker-dealer to the likelihoodthat the foreign broker-dealer is taking advantage of U.S. customers orotherwise violating U.S. securities laws, and the registered broker-dealernevertheless continues to effect questionable transactions on behalf ofthe foreign broker-dealer or its customers, the registered broker-dealer'srole in the trades may give rise to possible violations of the federalsecurities laws.\153\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\151\ Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23654.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\152\ In particular, SRO rules impose specific supervisoryduties on SRO members regarding customers' accounts. <T3>E.g.,</T3> Article III, Section 27, NASD Rules of Fair Practice, <T3>NASD Manual</T3> (CCH) andpara;2177 at 2109 (``Each member shall reviewthe activities of each office, which shall include the periodic examinationof customer accounts to detect and prevent irregularities or abuses. **  *''); NYSE Rule 342.16, <T3>NYSE Guide</T3> (CCH) andpara;2342 at 3587 (``Duties of supervisors ofregistered representatives should ordinarily include at least review ofcorrespondence of registered representatives, transactions, and customeraccounts.''); NYSE Rule 405, <T3>NYSE Guide</T3> (CCH) andpara;2405 at 3696 (``Every member organizationis required * * * to * * * (1) Use due diligence to learn the essentialfacts relative to every customer, every order, [and] every cash or marginaccount * * * accepted or carried by such organization.

Finally, Rule 15a-6 as adopted does not allow banks to serve as the intermediaryin transactions between U.S. institutional investors or major U.S. institutionalinvestors and foreign broker-dealers. Despite the views expressed by severalbanks,\154\<NOTE/> the Commission does not believe that it would be appropriateto permit any unregistered entity to perform this function, since thisentity would not be subject to the Commission's extensive statutory authorityto regulate, examine, and discipline registered broker-dealers.\155\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\154\ The Canadian Bankers' Association, the Institute ofInternational Bankers, and the Bank of America expressed the view thatdomestic banks should be permitted to serve as the U.S. intermediary foraffiliated foreign broker-dealers.

Proposed Rule15a-6 would have allowed unregistered foreign broker-dealers to contactcertain classes of U.S. institutional investors, which were limited toU.S. persons described in Rule 501(a) (1), (2), or (3) of Regulation Dunder the Securities Act\156\<NOTE/> that, with the exception of registered broker-dealers, hadtotal assets in excess of $100 million.

Further, if a registered investment company itself didnot have total assets in excess of $100 million, it qualified as a U.S.institutional investor if it was part of a family of investment companies(as defined in the rule) that had total assets in excess of $100 million. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\156\ 17 CFR 230.501(a) (1), (2), or (3). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\157\ 15 U.S.C. 78<T3>o</T3>(b). <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\158\ 26 U.S.C 501(c)(3).

At the same time, the Commission does not believethat sophistication is in all circumstances an effective substitute forbroker-dealer regulation. For example, systemic safeguards flowing frombroker-dealer registration, such as financial responsibility requirements,are benefits that can be assured more effectively through governmentalregulation.\165\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\165\ Similarly, in proposing Rule 144A, which would providea safe-harbor exemption from the registration requirements of the SecuritiesAct for resales of securities to institutional investors, the Commissionsought to define a limited class of institutional investors that it couldbe ``confident * * * have extensive experience'' in the market. SecuritiesAct Release No. 6806 (Oct. 25, 1988), 53 FR 44016, 44028 (``Release 33-6806'').The Commission proposed to permit only a subset of institutions, thosewith over $100 million in assets, to resell securities free of resale restrictions.Release 33-6806, 53 FR at 44027-29. All comments received on proposed Rule144A, together with a comment summary, are publicly available in File No.S7-23-88.   After considering the comments, the Commission has decided to retain theproposed rule's $100 million asset test for foreign broker-dealers contactingmajor U.S. institutional investors without an associated person of a registeredbroker-dealer participating in the contact.\166\<NOTE/> As the Commission stated in proposing the rule, the assettest was based on the view that ``direct U.S. oversight of the competenceand conduct of foreign sales personnel may be of less significance wherethey are soliciting only U.S. institutional investors with high levelsof assets,'' and the $100 million asset level was intended ``to increasethe likelihood that the institution or its investment advisers have priorexperience in foreign markets that provides insight into the reliabilityand reputation'' of foreign broker-dealers.\167\<NOTE/>   <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\166\ Some commenters on proposed Rule 144A, <T3>supra </T3>note 165, suggested that the rule, if adopted, permit onlythose institutions with over $100 million in investment securities to resellsecurities free of resale restrictions. The staff is giving this suggestionserious consideration, in addition to considering other changes to thedefinition in Rule 144A of institutional investor including the scope ofthe term ``family of investment companies that also appears in the Rule.If the Commission incorporates these changes into Rule 144A, then the Commissionalso will consider whether to incorporate similar standards into Rule 15a-6.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\167\ Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23654. Currently, the Commission continues to believe that institutions with thislevel of assets are more likely to have the skills and experience to assessindependently the integrity and competence of the foreign broker-dealersproviding this access. Moreover, these larger institutions have greaterability to demand information demonstrating the financial position of theforeign broker-dealer. Accordingly, the Rule allows foreign broker-dealers to contact U.S. institutionalinvestors with the participation of a U.S. associated person, and to contactindependently U.S. institutional investors with over $100 million in assetsor assets under management. The Rule thus adds the $100 million asset testto the U.S. institutional investor definition for certain purposes.\168\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\168\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 108 and accompanying text regarding U.S. distributionof foreign research; <T3>see infra </T3>notes 178-80 and accompanying text regarding U.S. visitsby foreign associated persons. The Rule also includes certain trusts recognizedunder Rule 501(a)(7), 17 CFR 230.501(a)(7), within the definition of U.S.institutional investor. In addition, when proposing Rule 15a-6, the Commissionsaid that U.S. branches or agencies of foreign banks could not qualifyas U.S. institutional investors, because Regulation D treated only domesticbanks as accredited investors. <T3>See supra </T3>note 164. Rule 501(a)(1), 17 CFR 230.501(a)(1), refersto banks defined in section 3(a)(2) of the Securities Act, which generallymeans ``any national bank, or any banking institution organized under thelaws of any State, Territory, or the District of Columbia, the businessof which is substantially confined to banking and is supervised by theState or territorial banking commission or similar official.'' 15 U.S.C.77c(a)(2). In Release 33-6661, <T3>supra </T3>note 16, the Commission decided that U.S. branches or agenciesof foreign banks subject to an appropriate level of U.S. banking regulationwould be deemed ``banks'' for purposes of section 3(a)(2). A recent staffletter confirmed that U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks satisfyingthe standards of Release No. 6661, so that their securities would be exemptfrom Securities Act registration by virtue of section 3(a)(2), are treatedas accredited investors under Rule 501(a)(1). Letter from Richard K. Wulff,Chief, Office of Small Business Policy, Division of Corporation Finance,SEC, to Lawrence R. Uhlick, Esq., Institute of International Bankers (Jan.4, 1989). Therefore, these U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banksare included in the definition of U.S. institutional investor in the Rule.The Commission notes that the expanded rule deleted the language in theproposed rule that included the following in the definition of U.S. institutionalinvestor: institutions organized or incorporated under the laws of theUnited States, its territories or possessions, or any state or the Districtof Columbia; institutions organized or incorporated under the laws of anyforeign jurisdiction but conducting business principally in the UnitedStates; and branches of foreign entities located in the United States orits territories or possessions. The Commission has deleted these referencesfrom the Rule as unnecessary, because these entities already are includedin the definition without regard to nationality. Accordingly, the use ofthe procedures specified in the exemptions under the Rule, in lieu of broker-dealerregistration, would be required of foreign broker-dealers that solicitedthe permanent U.S. branches or agencies of any foreign entities.\1\\6\\9\<NOTE/> This position is consistent with the general principles discussedabove regarding foreign persons present in this country on other than atemporary basis.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\\9\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 168 regarding U.S. branches and agencies of foreignbanks. (3) Operation. Paragraph (a)(3)(i) of the Rule sets forth the conditionsto be met by a foreign broker-dealer wishing to engage in direct contactswith U.S. institutional investors or major U.S. institutional investorswithout registration. Paragraph (a)(3)(i)(A) requires the foreign broker-dealerto effect these transactions through a registered broker-dealer, as discussedbelow. Under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B), the foreign broker-dealer must providethe Commission, upon request or pursuant to agreements reached betweenany ``foreign securities authority'' \1\\7\\0\<NOTE/> and the Commission or the U.S. government, with any informationor documents within the possession, custody, or control of the foreignbroker-dealer, any testimony of foreign associated persons, and any assistancein taking the evidence of other persons, wherever located, that the Commissionrequests and that relates to transactions under the direct contact exemptionunder paragraph (a)(3) of the Rule. Unlike the proposed rule, however,these requirements are subject to an exception for information, documents,testimony, or assistance withheld in compliance with foreign blocking statutesor secrecy laws.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\0\ New section 3(a)(50) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.78c(a)(50), defines this term to mean ``any foreign government, or anygovernmental body or regulatory organization empowered by a foreign governmentto administer or enforce its laws as they relate to securities matters.''<T3>See </T3>Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988,Pub. L. No. 101-704, section 6(a), 102 Stat. 4677, 4681. If, after the foreign broker-dealer has exercised its best efforts to providethis information, documents, testimony, or assistance, which specificallyincludes requesting the appropriate foreign governmental body and, if legallynecessary, its customers (with respect to customer information) to permitthe foreign broker or dealer to provide the requested information, documents,testimony, or assistance to the Commission, the foreign broker-dealer isprohibited by applicable foreign law or regulations from satisfying theCommission's request, then it would continue to qualify for the exemptionunder paragraph (a)(3). Under paragraph (c), however, the Commission, afternotice and opportunity for hearing, may withdraw the direct contact exemptionunder paragraph (a)(3) of the Rule with respect to the subsequent activitiesof the foreign broker-dealer, or class thereof, whose home country's lawor regulations have prohibited the foreign broker-dealer from respondingto the Commission's requests for information, documents, testimony, orassistance under paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B). Several commenters suggested that the Commission not require foreign broker-dealersto comply with the requirements in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) to the extentthat doing so actually would result in a violation of foreign blockingstatutes, secrecy laws, or legal requirements to obtain the consent offoreign customers.\1\\7\\1\<NOTE/> The Commission agrees with the commenters that automaticremoval of a     foreign broker-dealer from the Rule's protections wouldbe inappropriate. Nevertheless, given the importance of the Commission'saccess to information, documents, testimony, and assistance concerningforeign broker-dealers' exempted activities for the Commission's enforcementof the U.S. securities laws, the Commission believes that foreign broker-dealersshould be given strong incentives to use their best efforts to providerequested information, documents, testimony, and assistance to the Commission,including consulting with the foreign securities authority or other appropriategovernmental body administering any relevant foreign law or regulationsrestricting compliance. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\1\ Quayle, Union Bank of Switzerland, the Instituteof International Bankers, the PSA, the SIA, James Capel, the ABA, SecurityPacific, the NYSBA, and Sullivan andamp; Cromwell. Therefore, the Commission has retained these requirements in paragraph(a)(3), subject to an exception for information, documents, testimony,or assistance that the foreign broker-dealer has used its best effortsto provide, but has been prohibited from making available by foreign lawsor regulations.\1\\7\\2\<NOTE/> Moreover, the Commission would have the ability under paragraph(c) to remove the exemption for a foreign broker-dealer or class of foreignbroker-dealers in circumstances where the Commission believes that itsinability to obtain information, documents, testimony, or assistance becauseof foreign blocking statutes or secrecy laws   raises serious investorprotection or enforcement concerns. Under paragraph (c), the exemptionunder paragraph (a)(3) can be withdrawn only prospectively, and only byCommission order after notice and hearing, to which the usual proceduralrights would attach.\1\\7\\3\<NOTE/> In addition, Commission withdrawal of the exemption is discretionary,not mandatory, and it would be subject to the same review as other Commissionorders.\1\\7\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\2\ If the Commission requested testimony of a foreignassociated person who no longer was associated with the foreign broker-dealer,or who terminated association with the foreign broker-dealer after theCommission made its request, the Commission would consider the foreignbroker-dealer to have complied with the Rule if it then used its best effortsto assist the Commission in taking the evidence of those persons.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\3\ <T3>See </T3>5 U.S.C. 554. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\4\ <T3>See </T3>5 U.S.C 701-706.  The requirements in paragraph (a)(3)(i)(B) of the Rule apply only to transactionseffected under the provisions of paragraph (a)(3). As proposed by the Commission,these requirements would have applied to any transactions of a foreignbroker-dealer with a U.S. institutional investor or the registered broker-dealerthrough which they were effected. The limitation in the Rule was suggestedby several commenters.\1\\7\\5\<NOTE/> The Commission does not wish to impose unnecessary burdenson foreign broker-dealers seeking to claim this exemption, and the Commissionbelieves that it will be able to obtain the information necessary to carryout its enforcement responsibilities, with respect to a foreign broker-dealer'sactivities outside the Rule, through cooperation with foreign securitiesauthorities.\1\\7\\6\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\5\ The Bank of America, Quayle, the PSA, the SIA, theABA, Security Pacific, and Sullivan andamp; Cromwell. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\7\\6\ <T3>See </T3>note 170 <T3>supra.</T3>Paragraph (a)(3)(ii) of the Rule imposes requirements on foreign associatedpersons of the foreign broker-dealer. Paragraph (b)(2) of the Rule defines``foreign associated person'' to mean any natural person resident outsidethe United States who is an associated person, as defined in section 3(a)(18)of the Exchange Act,\177\<NOTE/> of a foreign broker-dealer, and who participates in the solicitationof a U.S. institutional investor or a major U.S. institutional investorunder paragraph (a)(3) of the Rule.

Paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(A) of the Rule requires foreign associated personsof the foreign broker-dealer effecting transactions with U.S. institutionalinvestors or major U.S. institutional investors to conduct all their securitiesactivities from outside the United States,\178\<NOTE/> with one exception. This exception allows a foreign associatedperson to conduct visits to U.S. institutional investors and major U.S.institutional investors within the United States, provided that the foreignassociated person is accompanied on these visits by an associated personof a registered broker-dealer that accepts responsibility \179\<NOTE/> for the foreign associated person's communications with theseinvestors, and that transactions in any securities discussed by the foreignassociated person are effected only through that registered broker-dealerpursuant to the provisions of paragraph (a)(3), not by the foreign broker-dealer.This exception has been added to the proposed rule in response to severalcomments that foreign associated persons should be allowed to visit U.S.institutions in this country, to create and sustain business relationshipswith these investors.\180\<NOTE/> The proposed rule prohibited any U.S. activities by foreignassociated persons, but the Commission believes that, where a registeredbroker-dealer is present and acts as an intermediary in the execution oforders, visits to these investors should be permitted.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\178\ Paragraph (b)(6) of the Rule defines the term ``UnitedStates'' to mean the United States of America, including the states andany territories and other areas subject to its jurisdiction. This definitionhas been adopted from paragraph (c)(6) of the expanded rule, and the termis not defined in the Exchange Act or the rules thereunder. Section 3(a)(16)of the Exchange Act, however, already defines ``State'' to mean ``any Stateof the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the VirginIslands, or any other possession of the United States.'' 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(16).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\179\ The Commission would expect the associated person tobe familiar with the foreign broker-dealer's research reports discussedduring these visits, to conduct a prior review of any written materialsto be distributed during the visits, along with summaries or outlines ofthe foreign associated person's oral presentation, and to know whetherthe foreign associated person's statements were consistent with the foreignbroker-dealer's current recommendations. In general, the Commission's expectationsregarding the responsibility imposed on the registered broker-dealer anddischarged through its associated person during these visits would be thesame as those regarding the responsibility of a registered broker-dealerin connection with the distribution of research to U.S. institutional investors.<T3>See supra </T3>note 116. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\180\ Quayle, the PSA, Chase Manhattan Government Securities,the ABA, the SIA, Security Pacific, the NYSBA, Sullivan andamp; Cromwell,and Merrill Lynch.

Finally, paragraph (a)(3)(iii) of the Rule requires the use of a registeredbroker-dealer as an intermediary in effecting trades between U.S. institutionalinvestors or major U.S. institutional investors and the foreign broker-dealeras a condition for this exemption. Paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) first requiresthat transactions with these investors be effected through the registeredbroker-dealer. This means that the registered broker-dealer must handleall aspects of these transactions except the negotiation of their terms,\185\<NOTE/> which may occur between the investors and the foreign broker-dealer(through its foreign associated persons).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\8\\5\ Of course, the rules of foreign securities exchangesand over-the-counter markets may require the foreign broker-dealer, asa member or market maker, to perform the actual physical execution of transactionsin foreign securities listed on those exchanges or traded in those markets.The Rule would permit the foreign broker-dealer to perform this function.Paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) requires the registered broker-dealer throughwhich transactions with these investors are effected to be responsiblefor carrying out specified functions, so as to make the performance ofthese functions subject to direct Commission oversight. The registeredbroker-dealer must issue all required confirmations \186\<NOTE/> and account statements to the investors. These documentsare significant points of contact between the investor and the broker-dealer,and they provide important information. Also, as between the foreign broker-dealerand the registered broker-dealer, the latter is required to extend or arrangefor the extension of any credit to these investors in connection with thepurchase of securities.\187\<NOTE/> In addition, the registered broker-dealer is responsiblefor maintaining required books and records relating to the transactionsconducted under paragraph (a)(3) of the Rule, including those requiredby Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4,\188\<NOTE/> which facilitates Commission supervision and investigationof these transactions.\189\<NOTE/> As adopted, the functions required of the registered broker-dealerin paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A) are taken from the proposed rule, with someexceptions.\190\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\186\ <T3>See </T3>Rule 10b-10, 17 CFR 240.10b-10.

Merrill Lynchbelieved that it should be permissible for foreign custodian banks to handlethe clearance and settlement of foreign securities transactions by theinvestors under the Rule. The Commission notes that Rule 15c3-3(c)(4),17 CFR 240.15c3-3(c)(4), already permits the use of designated foreigncontrol locations deemed satisfactory by the Commission for purposes ofcompliance with that rule. Sullivan andamp; Cromwell spoke without elaborationof a registered broker-dealer that ``introduced'' its U.S. customers toa foreign broker-dealer. If this term signified the presence of an introducing-clearingrelationship, where the foreign broker-dealer held U.S. customers' fundsand securities, registration of the foreign broker-dealer would be required.<T3>See </T3>Part III.B. <T3>supra. </T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\190\ Like paragraph (b)(3) of the expanded rule, the Ruledeletes as unnecessary the express requirement that the registered broker-dealereffect transactions ``with or for'' the U.S. institutional investor orthe major U.S. institutional investor. As explained above, paragraph (a)(4)(i)(A)of the Rule already requires the foreign broker-dealer to effect, transactions``through'' the registered broker-dealer. The phrase ``as between the foreignbroker or dealer and the registered broker or dealer'' in paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(A)(<T3>3</T3>) concerning extension of credit, found in paragraph (b)(3)(i)(B)of the expanded rule, has been added for clarification. Paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(B) of the Rule requires the registered broker-dealerto participate through an associated person in all oral communicationsbetween foreign associated persons and U.S. institutional investors. Byvirtue of this participation, the registered broker-dealer would becomeresponsible for the content of these communications, and the Commission'sstatements regarding the nature and discharge of similar responsibilitiesregarding the distribution of research and U.S. visits by foreign associatedpersons would apply.\191\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\191\ <T3>See supra </T3>notes 116 and 179. This requirement for ``participation''under the Rule would be satisfied if the associated person of the registeredbroker-dealer was present, either physically or telephonically, duringthese oral communications, and was able to take part in them as they occurred. The requirement in paragraph (a)(4)(iii)(C) of the Rule for the registeredbroker-dealer to obtain from the foreign broker-dealer, for each foreignassociated person, the information specified in Rule 17a-3(a)(12),\192\<NOTE/> including sanctions imposed by foreign securities authorities,exchanges, or associations (including without limitation those describedin paragraph (a)(3)(ii)(B) of the Rule), also has been drawn from the proposedrule. In addition, paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(D) of the Rule requires the registeredbroker-dealer to obtain from the foreign broker-dealer and each foreignassociated person written consent to service of process for any civil actionbrought by or proceeding before the Commission or any SRO, as defined insection 3(a)(26) of the Exchange Act,\193\<NOTE/> stating that process may be served on the registered broker-dealeras provided on that broker-dealer's current Form BD. This language followsthe text of the proposed rule. Some commenters argued that both the informationprovision and consent requirements as proposed were overbroad and wouldrestrict use of the Rule,\194\<NOTE/> but the Commission does not believe that it is desirableto draw the requirement to consent to service of process more narrowlyto relate only to transactions effected in reliance on the Rule's intermediaryexemption.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\192\ 17 CFR 240.17a-3(a)(12).

Further, paragraph (a)(3)(iii)(E) of the Rule requires the registered broker-dealerto maintain a written record of the information and consents required byparagraphs (a)(3)(iii) (C) and (D),\195\<NOTE/> and all records in connection with trading activities ofU.S. institutional investors or major U.S. institutional investors involvingthe foreign broker-dealer conducted under paragraph (a)(3) of the Rule,in an office of the registered broker-dealer located in the United States(thus, with respect to nonresident U.S. broker-dealers, pursuant to Rule17a-7(a)) \196\<NOTE/> and make these records available to the Commission upon request.This language follows the proposed rule, with the exception of the referenceto nonresident registered broker-dealers. One commenter suggested thatthese broker-dealers should be allowed to serve as intermediary registeredbroker-dealers under the Rule,\197\<NOTE/> and the Commission agrees, as stated above. The Commissionattaches considerable importance, however, to preserving its access torecords relating to activities conducted under paragraph (a)(3). Theserecords will enable the Commission to carry out its enforcement responsibilitiesand exercise its supervision over the registered broker-dealer intermediary.This intermediary, therefore, whether resident or nonresident, must maintainall the records called for by the Rule in an office within the territoriallimits of the United States.\198\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\195\ The Commission notes that SROs exercising their authorityto inspect their members performing the intermediary function under theRule should examine the records of the information and the consents requiredby the Rule.

If, however, the foreign broker-dealer controlled theregistered broker-dealer's day-to-day market making activities by explicitrestrictions on the U.S. broker-dealer's ability to execute orders againstthe foreign broker-dealer's positions or to take independent positions,the foreign broker-dealer could be considered a dealer subject to U.S.broker-dealer registration requirements.\205\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\204\ <T3>See</T3> note 205 <T3>infra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\205\ <T3>See, e.g.,</T3> the Vickers da Costa/Citicorp order, <T3>supra</T3> note 131, which exempted several related foreign broker-dealersfrom U.S. broker-dealer registration requirements. Because of Glass-SteagallAct restrictions applicable to the U.S. affiliate, <T3>see</T3> 12 U.S.C. 24 and 378, the foreign broker-dealers agreed toprovide the U.S. affiliate with standing orders to buy and sell the securitiesin which the U.S. affiliate previously had acted as a market maker. Thus,the U.S. affiliate's quote in NASDAQ always would reflect a previouslyentered firm order from the foreign broker-dealers. The U.S. affiliate'sactivities would be limited to executing, on a riskless principal basis,any orders received from U.S. customers against these orders. This arrangementwas approved by the Comptroller of the Currency. Letter from Judith A.Walter, Senior Deputy Comptroller, to Ellis E. Bradford, Vice President,Citibank, N.A. (June 13, 1986). <ITAG tagnum="28">In its exemptive order, the Commission allowed the foreign broker-dealersto buy and sell simultaneously on a continuing basis through the U.S. affiliatewithout registering in the United States as broker-dealers. However, theCommission imposed a number of limitations to provide additional regulatorysafeguards. The foreign broker-dealers' control over the price and sizeof their standing orders was limited in order to give the U.S. affiliatesome discretion in its trading activities. The U.S. affiliate also agreedto satisfy additional net capital requirements intended to increase itsability to meet its settlement obligations upon failure of the foreignbroker-dealers. In addition, the parent of the broker-dealers representedthat information regarding the trading activities of the foreign broker-dealerswould be made available to the Commission in connection with any investigation,and that it would attempt to obtain customer consent to release of informationconcerning their trading, if requested. Finally, the parent agreed thatit would be designated as the foreign broker-dealers' agent for serviceof process in any proceeding or other action involving the foreign broker-dealers.The foreign broker-dealers also limited their securities activities inthe United States to those enumerated in the letter, and the parent representedthat the foreign broker-dealers would not engage in any securities businesswith U.S. citizens.</ITAG>(2) International organizations. Paragraph (a)(4)(ii) of the Rule exemptsforeign broker-dealers that deal with certain international organizations,regardless of their location or whether the U.S. jurisdictional means areimplicated. They include the African Development Bank, the Asian DevelopmentBank, the Inter-American Development Bank, the International Bank for Reconstructionand Development, the International Monetary Fund, the United Nations, andtheir agencies, affiliates, and pension funds. These are the same internationalorganizations specified in proposed Regulation S,\206\<NOTE/> together with their pension funds, as suggested by severalcommenters.\207\<NOTE/>  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\206\ Release 33-6779, 53 FR at 22677. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\207\ The SIA, the ABA, and Sullivan andamp; Cromwell.(3) Foreign persons temporarily present in the United States. Paragraph(a)(4)(iii) of the Rule includes any foreign person temporarily presentin the United States, with whom the foreign broker-dealer had a bona fide,pre-existing relationship before the foreign person entered the UnitedStates. This paragraph codifies part of the proposed interpretive statement,\208\<NOTE/> and is taken from paragraph (a)(1)(v) of the expanded rule,with one exception. The phrase ``before the foreign person entered theUnited States'' has been added to clarify the nature of the relationship.The Commission is of the view that a foreign broker-dealer that solicitsor engages in securities transactions with or for these persons while theyare temporarily present in this country need not register with the Commission.\209\<NOTE/> <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\208\ Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23649. <T3>See also</T3> Security Pacific and National Westminster Bank letters,<T3>supra</T3> note 68.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\209\ This position is consistent with the proposal of theAmerican Law Institute that a nonresident broker-dealer that ``does businesswith * * * a non-national of the United States who is present as a nonresidentwithin the United States and was previously a customer or client'' shouldnot be subject to U.S. broker-dealer jurisdiction. <T3>ALI Federal Securities Code</T3> andSection; 1905(b)(2)(B) (1980).

One commenter asked the Commission to define U.S. residency for purposesof compliance with this and other exemptions in the Rule.\210\<NOTE/> The Commission does not believe that it would be appropriateto establish a separate standard of residency for the purpose of claimingthis exemption different from those generally established under state orfederal law.\211\<NOTE/> As stated in Release 34-25801, questions regarding the temporarynature of a person's presence in this country would be fact-specific.\212\<NOTE/> The Commission would take the position, however, that a foreignperson not otherwise deemed a resident of the United States under applicablelaw would be presumed to be temporarily present in this country for thepurpose of paragraph (a)(3) of the Rule. This presumption, of course, wouldbe subject to rebuttal in light all of the facts and circumstances surroundingthat foreign person's presence in the United States.  <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\210\ The NYSBA. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\211\ <T3>See generally, e.g.,</T3> section 911 of the Internal Revenue Code,26 U.S.C. 911, which provides certain exclusions from the gross incomeof U.S. citizens resident abroad.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\212\ 53 FR at 23649.(4) Foreign agencies or branches of U.S. persons. The proposed rule andthe expanded rule both provided an exemption for foreign broker-dealerseffecting or soliciting transactions by agencies or branches of U.S. persons,which were located outside the United States and were operated for validbusiness reasons. The Commission has retained this exemption in the Ruleto clarify that foreign broker-dealers that deal outside the United Stateswith branches and agencies having an established location outside the UnitedStates do not need to register with the Commission, provided that the transactionsoccur outside the United States.Commenters suggested that the presence of a valid business purpose wasunnecessary in the broker-dealer context. \2\\1\\3\<NOTE/> The Commission agrees. The Rule's exemption for unsolicitedtrades reflects the view that U.S. persons seeking out unregistered foreignbroker-dealers outside the U.S. cannot expect the protection of U.S. broker-dealerstandards. The Commission believes that this rationale applies equallyto U.S. branches and agencies established overseas that choose to dealwith unregistered foreign broker-dealers.\2\\1\\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\3\ The SIA, the ABA, and Sullivan andamp; Cromwell. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\4\ The Commission has deleted the exemption in theproposed rule that referred to affiliates or subsidiaries of U.S. personsthat were located outside this country and organized or incorporated underthe laws of any foreign jurisdiction. The Commission has decided that thisexemption is unnecessary, since these entities should not properly be regardedas U.S. persons.(5) Nonresident U.S. citizens. Finally, paragraph (a)(4)(v) of the Ruleincludes U.S. citizens resident outside the United States, provided thatthe foreign broker-dealer does not direct its selling efforts toward identifiablegroups of U.S. citizens resident abroad.\2\\1\\5\<NOTE/> Like the exemption regarding foreign branches and agenciesof U.S. persons, all transactions must occur outside the United States.As discussed above in Part III.B., neither U.S. citizens resident abroadnor foreign broker-dealers normally would expect that the U.S. broker-dealerregistration requirements would be triggered by non-U.S. securities transactionsbetween them.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\5\ <T3>See supra </T3>note 51 and accompanying text.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion</ITAG>The Commission believes that the conditional exemptions in Rule 15a-6 forforeign broker-dealers engaging in certain activities involving U.S. investorsand securities markets will reduce the costs and increase the efficiencyof international securities transactions as well as facilitate the internationalflow of information. The differing procedures in the Rule for nondirectand direct contacts by foreign broker-dealers with U.S. investors alsowill facilitate the access of U.S. investors to foreign securities marketsthrough those foreign broker-dealers and the research that they provide,consistent with the regulatory safeguards afforded by broker-dealer registration.In light of the importance that the Commission attaches to broker-dealer registration and regulation in the international context, the Commissionbelieves that the exemptions in Rule 15a-6 are in the public interest andconsistent with the protection of U.S. investors.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI.

The Commissionbelieves that adoption of the Rule will not impose any burden on competitionnot necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the ExchangeAct, especially since the Rule provides exemptions for eligible foreignbroker-dealers from the broker-dealer registration requirements under theExchange Act. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\6\ 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).Pursuant to section 3(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act,\2\\1\\7\<NOTE/> when the Commission proposed Rule 15a-6 Chairman Ruder certifiedthat the proposed rule, if adopted, would not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities.\2\\1\\8\<NOTE/> The Commission did not receive any comments on the Chairman'scertification.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\7\ 5 U.S.C. 603(b).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\\1\\8\ Release 34-25801, 53 FR at 23655.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 17 CFR Part 240 </ITAG>Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Securities. <ITAG tagnum="84">VII.
