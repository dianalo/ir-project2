And last week, according to traders, there was a minor renewal in institutional buying of OTC stocks.    But this time, professional investors hope to make money more quietly than they did early in the year. They remember how the boom in small stocks withered in March under the glare of bull-market publicity; some portfolio managers back then were complaining that the public excitement over little stocks was a bit overdone. Many of them started selling small stocks heavily and to a large extent haven't returned as buyers since then.    &quot;To some degree it was overdone in the first quarter. You read about the OTC market in just about every publication,&quot; says Morris Smith, portfolio manager of the $825 million Fidelity OTC Mutual Fund. But although smaller stocks aren't as attractive now as they were in December, Mr. Smith says, &quot;the OTC market is still cheaper as a general rule.&quot;    OTC stocks as measured by the Nasdaq composite index were up about 15% in March from the end of 1987. But because the OTC market has stagnated in the past two months, the Nasdaq composite at Friday's close was still about 14% higher than at the end of last year.    Of course, that 14% rise outpaces just about any other barometer of 1988 stock performance, outside of the Nikkei Stock Average that tracks Japan's still-booming market (up about 30% this year).    Edward Hartmann, president of American Express Co.'s IDS Growth Spectrum Advisors, a portfolio manager that focuses on growth stocks, says that after almost five years of underperformance, the strength in small stocks is clearly more than a &quot;one-quarter flash.&quot; He shrugs off the recent leveling-off in the Nasdaq composite index.    &quot;I think quarter to quarter, year to year we're looking at an extended period of outperformance for smaller companies,&quot; Mr. Hartmann says.    That doesn't mean that smaller stocks won't lag the rest of the market for certain periods, he concedes. For example, in the past month the Sandamp;P 500 gained 0.32% but the Nasdaq Industrial Index was down 2.5%. &quot;We may have another month of that. This month and perhaps July,&quot; Mr. Hartmann says.    Yet Mr. Hartmann says OTC stocks that have tacked on gains this year haven't necessarily peaked.    He and others like Autodesk, for example, even though the stock has already almost doubled this year, closing Friday at 28 1/2. The $675 million market-value company, based in Sausalito, Calif., makes software for computer-aided design and drafting. Mr. Hartmann is also a fan of technology stocks Software Publishing, Mentor Graphics and Novell, and health-care stocks St. Jude Medical and Molecular Biosystems.    Autodesk is also on Stephen Lieber's list of OTC stocks that have soared this year but haven't necessarily peaked. Mr. Lieber is senior partner of Lieber andamp; Co., which manages the Evergreen Fund that is about 75%-invested in small-to-medium capitalization companies.    Other OTC stocks that have soared but that Mr. Lieber believes are still good buys are Envirodyne Industries, which was 15 1/2 in December and closed at 29 3/4 Friday, and JLG Industries, which was 7 in December and 13 Friday. Chicago-based Envirodyne, which is studying whether to merge or sell itself, makes food-packaging products. JLG, based in McConnellsburg, Pa., makes hydraulic machinery.    Some market professionals, while remaining bullish on OTC stocks, are buying different OTC stocks from those they bought before. Fidelity's Mr. Smith says in the past few months, as he has taken profits on industrial stocks, he has bought more financial-sector issues to replace them. The fund boosted its regional-bank, savings-and-loan and insurance issues to about a third of the fund from less than 25%, he says.    Financial issues &quot;tend to do well in bad markets,&quot; Mr. Smith says. He has snapped up Northern Trust, Manufacturers National, Comerica and Citizens andamp; Southern, and among insurance issues that so far this year haven't taken off he likes Hanover Insurance and St. Paul Cos.    Even if all these issues don't shoot straight up as the Nasdaq composite did in the first quarter, Mr. Smith says he won't worry. &quot;Things in life don't generally go up in a straight line,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
