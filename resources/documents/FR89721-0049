Currently, only persons or firms operatingwaterfront elevators located in the CRB are eligible to issue shippingcertificates.(2) Eliminate the existing provision of the futures contract specifyingthat receivers of shipping certificates may elect to take delivery of whitewheat Free-on-Board (F.O.B.) a vessel at the certificate issuer's waterfrontelevator in the CRD. As amended, the contract will require the deliveryof white wheat by rail to a location in the CRD specified by the buyer.In addition, the amended contract will continue to specify that certificateissuers may choose to deliver by barge to the CRD if the quantity of wheatinvolved in the delivery is at least 90,000 bushels.(3) Reduce to one-sixteenth from one-fifth of one cent per bushel per daythe premium charge paid to issuers by holders of outstanding shipping certificatesand change the date on which the daily premium charge commences to 20 calendardays from the day the certificates are delivered. Currently, the futurescontract specifies that the daily premium charge on outstanding certificatescommences on the day after the certificates are delivered.(4) Establish new requirements that receivers of shipping certificatesmust make payment to the Exchange for such certificates and that the paymentshall be forwarded to the deliverer on the earlier of the day that thedeliverer provides documents indicating that the wheat has been shippedto the location in the CRD specified by the receiver, or the 20th calendarday after the day on which the delivery notice was delivered to the receiver.Any interest earned on funds while they are deposited with the Exchangewould be returned to the receiver less a servicing fee specified by theBoard of Directors. The existing contract terms require that the receiverdirectly pay the deliverer for the certificates on the day following thereceipt of the delivery notice.(5) Change the contract's quality specifications by deleting the existingprovision for delivery at par of grade U.S. No. 2 or better soft whitewheat, and providing in lieu thereof for the delivery of grade U.S. No.1 soft white wheat at par and grade U.S. No. 2 soft white wheat at a one-centper bushel discount.The MGE indicates that the proposal to expand the number of persons orfirms who may issue shipping certificates for delivery on the futures contractwill enhance the visability of the contract for hedging and pricing purposesby allowing a larger segment of the cash market to make full use of thebenefits of futures trading. In addition, the MGE notes that many elevatorsand producers located outside the CFD are reluctant to trade the futurescontract on the grounds that they currently cannot make delivery againstthe futures contract. The Exchange also indicates that the proposed amendmentdeleting the option of delivery of white wheat F.O.B. vessel in the CRDis appropriate in view of the fact that no vessel deliveries have occurredsince the futures contract began trading. In this respect, the MGE furtherindicates that cash market participants have noted that delivery by railor barge allows receivers greater flexibility than that afforded by vesseldelivery in regard to the movement of the wheat to a location desired bythe receiver.In addition, the MGE notes that the proposal to reduce to one-sixteenthof one cent per bushel the daily premium charge applicable to outstandingshipping certificates will bring the premium charge into close alignmentwith corresponding fees charged by commercial firms in the existing raildelivery cash market within the CRD. The Exchange further notes that itsproposals concerning the procedures for making and receiving payments forshipping certificates are intended, in part, to permit the contract's termsto reflect more closely cash market practices. Specifically, the MGE notesthat receivers of shipping certificates currently are required to makefull payment for the certificates on the day after the day the deliverynotice is received and, therefore, lose control over the funds used tomake payment without having yet received the wheat. The Exchange notesthat, under prevailing cash market practices, payment for the wheat isnot made until the grain has been received by the buyer. The MGE notesthat the proposed amendments will allow receivers, who request and receivedelivery of white wheat against certificates within 20 calendar days ofreceiving the certificates, to retain the interest earned on the fundsto be used in payment for the certificate until such time as the wheatis delivered to the receiver.The Exchange indicates that the proposed changes to the contract's qualityspecifications are intended to reflect the fact that grade U.S. No. 2 softwhite wheat typically trades at a one-cent per bushel discount to gradeU.S. No. 1 soft white wheat. The MGE believes that this proposed amendmentwill make the futures contract a more effective hedging and pricing mechanism.The Exchange proposes to make the proposed amendments effective within30 days after receipt of Commission approval. The MGE proposes to applythe proposed amendments to all contract months listed subsequent to theeffective date for the proposals and to any contract months listed on theeffective date which do not have open interest.The Commission is seeking comment on the proposed amendments noted above.Copies of the proposed amendments will be available for inspection at theOffice of the Secretariat, Commodity Futures Trading Commission, 2033 KStreet, NW., Washington, DC 20581. Copies of the amended terms and conditionscan be obtained through the Office of the Secretariat by mail at the aboveaddress or by phone at (202) 254-6314.The materials submitted by the Exchange in support of the proposed amendmentsmay be available upon request pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act(5 U.S.C. 552) and the Commission's regulations thereunder (17 CFR Part145 (1987)).
