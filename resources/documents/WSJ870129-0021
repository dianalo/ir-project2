But the measures were limited by a continuing internal conflict over how to ease the price freeze, which stems from the nation's year-old anti-inflation plan.    Finance Minister Dilson Funaro said the increases were granted only to industries that had agreed to hold prices at the new levels for at least 120 days. Those sectors appear to represent, at most, 15% of the industries calling for immediate and substantial price increases.    The 120 days correspond to the length of a truce the government seeks with unions and business leaders. Under such a truce, new price and wage requests would be shelved in a bid to head off the threat of hyperinflation. But after more than a week of negotiations, there appears to be little hope that such an agreement will be reached.    Mr. Funaro estimated that the announced price rises would add about 7% to inflation in February. Many analysts believe consumer prices could jump as high as 15% next month, slightly more than the expected level for January. President Jose Sarney is expected to clarify the government's overall response to the mounting inflation during the next few days.    However, the government remains split over such issues as how quickly to raise prices, which prices should currently be controlled and monitored, and whether to maintain wage indexation. </TEXT></DOC>
