The vote was 51-48 in favor, but constitutional amendmentsrequire approval by a two-thirds margin in both houses of Congressand the Senate vote thus fell far short.   ``We can support the American flag without changing the AmericanConstitution,'' Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, declaredbefore the vote.   The measure would authorize the state and federal governments toban burning and desecration of the flag.   Eighteen Democrats joined 33 Republicans in support of theamendment, while 37 Democrats and 11 Republicans voted against it.   Bush repeatedly called for approval of such a measure, saying asimple statute such as one approved by the Senate last week wouldbe inadequate.   Critics of the amendment said it amounted to tampering theconstitutional right of Americans to freedom of expression. Butthey also expressed concern that opposition could be turned againstthem at election time in view of the power of the flag as apolitical symbol as demonstrated in last year's campaign.   Those concerns appeared to ease a bit in recent days. Asked whythat was, Mitchell told reporters this morning: ``I think the soundjudgment of the American people.'' Other lawmakers said theythought most Americans are not very concerned about the amendment.   ``We in America have chosen not to take the easy way out,''Mitchell told the Senate. ``We have chosen not to silence those whoare wrong. We have chosen instead to challenge them with thetruth.''   Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., making a final appeal for themeasure, declared that ``the flag stands alone as a unique symbolof our hopes and our aspirations and our ideals as a nation.''   ``To say that the act of flag burning is somehow deeplyenshrined in the First Amendment is preposterous,'' Dole said. Hesaid it was wrong in view of law that ``make it illegal to rip thewarning label off your own mattress in some states.''   To be approved, the proposed amendment needed 66 votes, equal totwo-thirds of the senators present and voting. It thus fell 15votes short.   Dole was glum in reacting to the vote, although it did not comeas a surprise. ``I think the flag should be flown at half-staffafter this vote,'' he said.   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the SenateJudiciary Committee, told colleagues that ``we did good work.''   ``We saved the flag and preserved the Constitution,'' he said.   Republican sponsors said the measure would end once and for allthe controversy over whether laws against flag-burning areunconstitutional.   The Supreme Court in June threw out the conviction of Texasflag-burner Gregory Lee Johnson, ruling that his freedom of speechhad been violated. Within days Bush called for a constitutionalamendment.   The House approved last week and sent to the president a billthat would ban flag-burning by simple statute. Bush said he wouldallow it to become law without his signature and vowed to press onfor the amendment.   Democratic critics said the amendment amounted to tampering withthe Bill of Rights. They said a simple statute would be better andthat amending the Constitution should only be a last resort.   Some Democratic senators said there was concern among lawmakersthat opponents of the amendment would find their patriotism underattack at election time. Others said most Americans were notworried about the issue.   Democrats also directed fire at Bush over his support for themeasure.   ``I would have to be naive if I didn't think his motives have apolitical bias,'' said Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark. After the vote, hepredicted, ``the politics will have favored those who voted forthis ill-conceived amendment _ tragic but true.''   Sen. Trent Lott, R-Miss., said he had heard the theory thatpassions have cooled on the flag issue but said they could bereignited.   ``Just wait,'' Lott said. He told the Senate that if there wereanother high-profile flag-burning incident ``the American peoplewill rise again.''   Metzenbaum said the amendment demanded a ``kind of loyalty(that) is a hallmark of communist countris and right-wingdictatorships.''   Rejecting the amendment would be ``saying to the nation thatthere is a limit to how shallow our politics can be,'' Metzenbaumsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
