These unique shale slopes of Paleozoicage are found in the Ridge and Valley Section of the Appalachian Mountainsfrom Pennsylvania south to Virginia and West Virginia. Usually surroundedby deciduous forest woodlands, shale barrens are isolated islands of habitatcharacterized by steep southern exposures (generally greater than 20 degreeslopes), relatively sparse vegetative cover, high temperatures and lowmoisture in the summer, and are usually undercut by a stream at the base(Keener 1983). Eighteen endemic plant taxa are recorded from the shalebarrens, including <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>and three other Federal candidate plant species(<T3>Allium Oxyphilum, Taenidia montana, Trifolium virginicum) </T3>(Keener1983).This species is biennial, with populations usually consisting of two age-classes:young, nonreproductive individuals present in basal rosette form; and second-yearplants that are potentially reproductive individuals present in the formof erect, flowering plants lacking a basal rosette of leaves. Another componentof populations is the seed bank, consisting of dormant, ungerminated seedsfound either at the ground surface or buried in the soil. <T3>A. serotina </T3>may not be a strict biennial, meaning that rosettesmay persist longer than one year, resulting in a delay of flowering andfruiting beyond the second year. Plants typically grow to a height of 30to 60 cm. (one to two feet), with a spreading, compound inflorescence ofmany tiny whitish flowers, each approximately two to three mm. long (one-eighthinch).Originally described by Edward Steele in 1911, the species has been confusedwith the morphologically similar <T3>Arabis laevigata </T3>(Muhl.) Poir var. <T3>burkii</T3> Porter. Hopkins (1937) reduced <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>to synonymy under <T3>Arabis laevigata</T3> var. <T3>burkii</T3>. Both taxa occur on shale barrens, although the latteris not an endemic. Weiboldt (1987a, 1987b) has shown that <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> is distinguished from <T3>Arabis laevigata </T3>var. <T3>burkii</T3> by several key characteristics. <T3>A. serotina </T3>is taller with wider and more-branched inflorescences,and has smaller flowers and more narrowly winged seeds than <T3>A. laevigata </T3>var. <T3>burkii</T3>. There are also considerable differences between the floweringperiods of the two taxa. All varieties of <T3>A. laevigata</T3>, including var. <T3>burkii</T3>, bloom in April and May and set seed before <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>begins to bloom in late June or early July. <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>continues to bloom into September (Wieboldt 1987b). <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>is presently known from only 26 populations infive Virginia counties (Allegheny, Augusta, Bath, Highland and Rockbridge)and three West Virginia counties (Greenbrier, Hardy and Pendleton). Anadditional 1934 record from Shenandoah County, Virginia has not been relocatedand is considered historic. The species has never been documented to bemore widespread, and the reported distribution in seven West Virginia counties(Strausbaugh and Core 1978) was based on collections of <T3>A. laevigata </T3>var. <T3>burkii </T3>(Bartgis 1985). The species' highly restricted range appearsto be a result of biogeographic events and not due to recent land-use changesor the lack of suitable habitat elsewhere. During 1983-85, a survey of70 shale barrens in eight West Virginia counties resulted in only a fewnew populations (Bartgis 1985). Searches of 15-20 barrens in the rangeof <T3>A. serotina </T3>in Virginia revealed few additional populations (Mr.Lipford, Virginia Natural Heritage Program, pers. comm. 1988).  In both Virginia and West Virginia, all populations occur on Brallier Formationshales on south- to southwest-facing slopes at elevations of 1300 to 2500feet. Most of the known populations occur partially or completely in theGeorge Washington and Monongahela National Forests.  Populations are fairly small at all 26 locations. Since plants in the rosettestage are inconspicuous and easily overlooked, most population counts referto only flowering and/or fruiting plants. Approximately 130 reproductiveplants were found at the 13 Virginia sites in 1987 (M. Lipford, pers. comm.1987) and only about 700 reproductive individuals comprised the 13 WestVirginia populations in 1985 (Bartgis in press). Although a few additionalpopulations may be located in the future, the typically small populationsizes suggest that the total number of individuals will remain small. Inboth states, most populations are moderately to severely browsed by deer.Rangewide, sites have been affected to some degree by road or railroadconstruction, small flood-control proejcts, and grazing by livestock. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) recognized <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>as a Category 2 candidate for listing in the Supplementto Review of Plant Taxa for Listing as Endangered or Threatened Speciespublished in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on November 28, 1983 (48 FR 53641). Category2 comprises those taxa for which listing is possibly appropriate but forwhich existing information is insufficient to support a proposed rule.The updated notice of review for plant taxa published on September 27,1988 again included <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>in Category 2.  In 1985, the Service contracted with The Nature Conservancy's Eastern RegionalOffice to conduct status survey work on <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>and other Federal candidate species. Those reports(Bartgis 1985, Rawinski and Cassin 1986) documented a high degree of threatat most <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>sites and recommended immediate listing by theService. This listing implements the protection provided by the EndangeredSpecies Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. <T3>et seq.</T3>) as amended, for <T3>Arabis serotina.</T3> <ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of Comments and Recommendations </ITAG>In the November 17, 1988 proposed rule and associated notifications, allinterested parties were requested to submit factual reports or informationthat might contribute to the development of a final rule. Appropriate Stateagencies, county governments, Federal agencies, scientific organizations,and other interested parties were contacted and requested to comment. Newspapernotices were published in the Covington Virginian, the Daily News Leader(Staunton), the Pendleton Times, the Inter-Mountain and the MoorefieldExaminer from November 22, 1988 through December 4, 1988. Ten commentswere received, including letters from one Federal agency, one State agency,three colleges or universities, and five conservation organizations orindividuals. Eight commentors supported listing, one acknowledged receiptof the proposal and the final commenter requested additional information.In addition, two of the commentors suggested that critical habitat be listed.The Service's reasons for not determining critical habitat for this speciesare stated below. Summary of Factors Affecting the Species After a thorough review and consideration of all information available,the Service has determined that <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> should be classified as an endangered species.Procedures found at section 4(a)(1) of the Endangered Species Act and regulations(50 CFR part 424) promulgated to implement the listing provisions of theAct were followed. A species may be determined to be an endangered or threatenedspecies due to one or more of the five factors described in section 4(a)(1).These factors and their application to <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> Steele (shale barren rock cress) are as follows:A. The Present or Threatened Destruction, Modification or Curtailment ofIts Habitat or Range In West Virginia, five of the shale barrens supporting known populationsof <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> have been partially destroyed by road constructionand a sixth was affected by a small flood-control dam which degraded thehabitat available for the species (Bartgis in press). In Virginia, threeshale barrens supporting known <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> populations were partially destroyed by road construction,two were damaged by railroad construction, and one is crossed by a hikingtrail (T. Wieboldt, Virginia Polytechnic Institute, pers. comm. 1987).The extent of the impacts of all these projects upon the <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> populations is unknown. Two of the West Virginiapopulations have been grazed by sheep or goats in the past. While no longergrazed by livestock, presently both sites have little vegetation, markederosional features, and very few <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> individuals (Bartgis in press). B. Overutilization for Commercial, Recreational, Scientific or EducationalPurposes <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> is not known to be used for any commercial orrecreational purpose. Because of its rarity, it may be subject to collectionby botanists and curiosity seekers. Since most populations consist of 20or fewer individuals, collection or vandalism at those sites could eliminatepopulations. C. Disease or Predation The larvae of the butterfly Olympia marble (<T3>Euchloe olympia</T3>) have been reported to feed on <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> (Clench and Opler 1983), but the report is believederroneous. Timing of larval emergence suggests that they feed on <T3>A. laevigata </T3>var. <T3>burkii</T3> (Bartgis in press). White-tailed deer (<T3>Odocoileus virginianus</T3>) are known to heavily browse <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> populations. As in many northeastern states, deer populations are increasing in bothVirginia and West Virginia, resulting in greater browsing pressure on manyherbaceous plants. In West Virginia, eight of eleven <T3>A. serotina</T3> populations surveyed in 1985 had been browsed by deerresulting in partial or complete loss of 15 percent to 70 percent (average30 percent) of the inflorescences in those populations. For example, inan unusually large population of 124 plants only 47 plants successfullyset seed (Bartgis in press). At three Virginia populations with only oneor two reproductive individuals each, all were browsed in 1987 (M. Lipfordpers. comm. 1987). Since the plant is a biennial inhabiting a stressfulenvironment, such a significant loss of propagules in any given year couldlead to lower reproductive success. As the median reproductive populationsize observed in West Virginia during 1985 was 17 plants, and in Virginiaduring 1987 was seven plants, any minor decreases in reproductive potentialthrough grazing or other means could completely eliminate populations.D. Inadequacy of Existing Regulatory Mechanisms <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> is not currently protected by any state or locallaws or regulations. Four populations in West Virginia and seven in Virginiaoccur in established National Forest Special Interest Areas (U.S. Dept.of Agriculture 1986a, 1986b). These areas are managed by the Forest Serviceto protect the habitat and species present. Some of these populations extendonto adjacent private land. Special Interest Areas (SIA) are not permanentdesignations and may be revoked by the administrating national forest.Although the SIA designation prevents habitat alteration, it does not provideprotection from threats such as deer predation that may adversely affectthese populations. One West Virginia population occurs on a shale barren leased by The NatureConservancy (TNC), and that organization is also securing voluntary protectionof at least two additional populations. These voluntary agreements haveno binding legal status. The ten populations on private land are not protectedby any laws or regulations. E. Other Natural or Manmade Factors Affecting Its Continued Existence Shale barren communities are relatively long-term features of the landscape,but may gradually be replaced by woodlands through succession (Keener 1983).However this process is slow and is unlikely to affect more than a veryfew <T3>Arabis serotina</T3> populations in the near future. <T3>A. serotina</T3> is the most sporadic and rarest of the shale barrenendemics (Wieboldt <T3>in</T3> Rawinski and Cassin 1986) and recent surveys show that populationshave declined in the past few years. In addition to predation by deer,populations have been adversely affected by severe droughts in 1987 and1988. One Virginia shale barren supported 100 reproductive individualsin 1985, but in 1987 only nine were found. Another Virginia shale barrenshowed three individuals in 1984 but none was found in 1987 (M. Lipford,pers. comm. 1987). At one West Virginia barren which had 136 reproductiveindividuals in 1985, only 12 plants set fruit in 1987 (Bartgis in press).Many biennial species typically exhibit fluctuations in population numbersfrom year to year; however, repeated loss of reproductive individuals severalseasons in succession poses a serious threat to long-term survival of species.Low population numbers combined with continually decreasing contributionsto the seed bank result in the species being particularly vulnerable toany natural or human-caused stresses. No attempt has been made to assessthe size of the seed bank at any population. If present trends continue,the future of smaller populations will be highly uncertain. The Service has carefully assessed the best scientific and commercial informationavailable regarding the past, present, and future threats faced by thespecies in determining to make this final rule. Based on this evaluation,the preferred action is to list <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>as endangered. Habitat degradation and loss ofreproduction through grazing pose severe problems to the continued existenceof the species. Although 26 populations are known, 15 of these populationsnumber 20 or fewer individuals, making the species particularly vulnerableto any threats. In addition, most of the available shale barren habitatfor this species has been inventoried, making it unlikely that many newpopulations will be found.<ITAG tagnum="84">Critical Habitat </ITAG>Section 4(a) 3 of the Act requires, to the maximum extent prudent and determinable,that the Secretary designate critical habitat at the time a species isdetermined to be endangered or threatened. The Service finds that designationof critical habitat is not presently prudent for <T3>Arabis serotina. </T3>Very small population sizes make this speciesparticularly vulnerable to any vandalism or collecting. Since the plantoccurs in unique, easily-identified habitats, publication of critical habitatmaps may result in vandalism and collection by curosity seekers. The Actprohibits taking of plants only in cases of (1) Removal and reduction topossession on lands under Federal jurisdiction, or malicious damage ordestruction on such lands; (2) removal, cutting, digging up, or damagingor destroying plants in knowing violation of any State law or regulation,including State criminal trespass law. The Forest Service, The Nature Conservancyand landowners of major populations on private land have been informedof population locations and the importance of protecting the species' habitat.Listing will result in habitat protection through the recovery processand section 7 consultations. Therefore, it would not be prudent to determinecritical habitat for <T3>Arabis serotina.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">Available Conservation Measures </ITAG>Conservation measures provided to species listed as endangered or threatenedunder the Endangered Species Act include recognition, recovery actions,requirements for Federal protection, and prohibitions against certain practices.Recognition through listing encourages and results in conservation actionsby Federal, State and private agencies, groups, and individuals. The EndangeredSpecies Act provides for possible land acquisition and cooperation withthe States and requires that recovery actions be carried out for all listedspecies. The protection required of Federal agencies and the prohibitionsagainst certain activities involving listed plants are discussed, in part,below. Section 7(a) of the Act, as amended, requires Federal agencies to evaluatetheir actions with respect to any species that is proposed or listed asendangered or threatened and with respect to its critical habitat, if anyis being designated. Regulations implementing this interagency cooperationprovision of the Act are codified at 50 CFR Part 402. Section 7(a)(2) requiresFederal agencies to ensure that activities they authorize, fund, or carryout are not likely to jeopardize the continued existence of a listed speciesor to destroy or adversely modify its critical habitat. If a Federal actionmay affect a listed species or its critical habitat, the responsible Federalagency must enter into formal consultation with the Service. The U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Service partially or completelyowns sixteen of the known <T3>Arabis serotina </T3>populations. Activities in these areas that mayaffect the species would require section 7 consultation. The Act and its implementing regulations found at 50 CFR 17.61, 17.62,and 17.63 set forth a series of general trade prohibitions and exceptionsthat apply to all endangered plants. With respect to <T3>Arabis serotina, </T3>all trade prohibitions of section 9(a)(2) ofthe Act, implemented by 50 CFR 17.61, apply. These prohibitions, in part,make it illegal for any person subject to the jurisdiction of the UnitedStates to import or export, transport in interstate or foreign commercein the course of a commercial activity, sell or offer for sale this speciesin interstate or foreign commerce, or to remove and reduce to possessionthe species from areas under Federal jurisdiction. In addition, for listedplants, the 1988 amendments (Pub. L. 100-478) to the Act prohibit the maliciousdamage or destruction on Federal Lands and the removal, cutting, diggingup, or damaging or destroying of listed plants in knowing violation ofany State law or regulation, including State criminal trespass law. Certainexceptions can apply to agents of the Service and State conservation agencies.The Act and 50 CFR 17.62 and 17.63 also provide for the issuance of permitsto carry out otherwise prohibited activities involving endangered speciesunder certain circumstances. It is anticipated that few trade permits wouldever be sought or issued since the species is not common in cultivationor in the wild. Requests for copies of the regulations on plants and inquiriesregarding them may be addressed to the Office of Management Authority,U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, P.O. Box 27329, Washington, DC 20038-7329(202/343-4955). <ITAG tagnum="84">National Environmental Policy Act </ITAG>The Fish and Wildlife Service has determined that an Environmental Assessment,as defined under the authority of the National Environmental Policy Actof 1969, need not be prepared in connection with regulations adopted pursuantto section 4(a) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973, as amended.
