The Government Accountability Project and the Community NutritionInstitute said in a statement filed with USDA's Food Safety andInspection Service that the changes should have an adequatescientific basis and that ``swift and meaningful penalties'' shouldbe imposed on processors who violate the rules.   USDA issued the proposal last November to carry out a 1986 lawthat would get tougher on inspections of the most troublesomeprocessing plants but ease up on those with good records.   The agency estimated that over time its inspection force would bereduced by half by retirements and resignations. The program wouldrely increasingly on ``good'' plants policing themselves.   But the two organizations said the proposed rules fail meet the1986 law's requirements and are ``unacceptably general and vague tothe point where they only propose a structure for relaxinginspection, but not intensifying it where needed.''   Also, they charged, the agency's own evaluation of pilot projectsusing the proposed system showed serious deficiencies.   ``The regulations were developed and drafted with no consultationwith consumer or other public interest groups or inspectors'' thestatement said.   As proposed, the new rule would apply to plants that makefrankfurters, beef stew, chicken soup, luncheon meats and scores ofother processed items that include meat and poultry. The proposedrule would not apply to slaughter plants, which would remain undercontinuous federal inspection.</TEXT></DOC>
