At a closed hearing that began Monday afternoon before a special panel of the Merc's board, the traders presented settlement offers. The Merc is expected to make public its sanctions as early as this week, people involved in the case said.    Terms of the settlement offers couldn't be learned, nor could it be learned whether the Merc panel accepted the offers or plans to impose harsher penalties.    Albert &quot;Bud&quot; Furman III and Patrick J. Shannon are the two main targets of the Merc case. Peter Shannon and Sidney L. Rabin face lesser charges. The sources expect the two main targets could receive fines of as much as $500,000 and be banned from trading, which the traders hope to avoid with settlement offers. Mr. Furman has already paid $252,500 as partial settlement of the charges against him.    &quot;Everybody made pitches&quot; to the board panel, a person involved in the case said. Such settlements typically entail neither an admission nor denial of charges.    As reported, the Merc members face prearranged trading charges for big trades made the week of the October 1987 stock market crash in which customers were allegedly cheated, according to internal Merc documents. The trades occurred in the Merc's Standard andamp; Poor's 500 stock index pit.    The traders had little choice but to try to settle. The Merc, in the wake of a broader federal investigation of futures trading pits, was expected to hand out tough sanctions regardless of the traders' defense. What's more, any effort to fight the charges could have required the traders to testify, which may have led to self-incrimination in any subsequent federal probe into the trades.    &quot;In this climate,&quot; an attorney familiar with the case said, &quot;a lawyer who allowed his client to talk should put his malpractice carrier on notice.&quot;    Federal law-enforcement officials probing futures pit trading at the Merc and Chicago Board of Trade are reviewing exchange disciplinary cases for possible prosecution, including this one, a person familiar with the federal probe said.    Meanwhile, the Merc's outside counsel disputed assertions made in a Wall Street Journal article published yesterday that the Merc was preparing to make an example of these traders in order to look tough in the face of federal indictments of 24 Merc traders earlier this month.    &quot;I don't think new pressure {resulting from the federal probe} stiffened the {Merc's approach to this} disciplinary case,&quot; Jerrold Salzman said. &quot;That conclusion was wrong. But I don't think anybody will believe that. I'm sure the defendants in this case believe that whatever happens to them is too much.&quot; In turn, Mr. Salzman said, the Merc's compliance department staff would probably like stiffer penalties than the Merc will hand out.    He wouldn't discuss any specifics of the case, nor of the exchange's handling of it.    As reported, after the exchange and the public learned of the broader federal investigation, the Merc: brought additional charges against Mr. Furman and Patrick Shannon; moved the case from a routine disciplinary committee of members to a special panel of the board, the only Merc body that can expel members; and made clear to the traders involved that sanctions would be tougher than originally expected, according to people involved in the case. </TEXT></DOC>
