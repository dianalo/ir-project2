A release issued by the U.S.-backed rebel government-in-exilesaid the pilot, Major Jalaluddin, was assigned to bomb thestrategic Kabul-to-Jalalabad highway in eastern Afghanistan when hediverted to Peshawar.   Jalaluddin, who uses only one name, was stationed at theCommunist government's largest air force base at Bagram, 145 mileseast of Peshawar.   A rebel commander, Rahim Wardak, said the defection waspre-arranged, although he refused to give details. Wardak is acommander with the moderate National Islamic Front of Afghanistanrebel group. The Pakistan government has custody of the pilot andthe aircraft, said Wardak.   Pakistan will keep the bomber ``until we can claim it for ourown, now that there is a hope that we will have an air force someday,'' Wardak said, referring to the rebels' goal of overthrowingthe Kabul government.   Anti-Communist fighters, headquartered in Pakistan, have beenbattling for more than a decade to topple the Soviet-backed Kabulgovernment.   Washington is the major backer of the guerrilla fighters, whileMoscow outfits its allies in Kabul.   After nine years of military intervention in Afghanistan, theKremlin withdrew the last of its 103,000 soldiers in February butpromised to continue arming the Kabul government as long as theUnited States supplied the rebels.   About two months ago another Afghan government pilot flew hisSU-22 ground-attack fighter to Peshawar and defected to the rebels.   The rebels, who call themselves mujahedeen, meaning Islamic holywarriors, also reported the death of a senior Communist armyofficer during fighting outside the key city of Jalalabad, 45 mileseast of the Pakistan border.   Afghanistan's official radio confirmed the officer's death.Rebels claimed the death occurred last week, but Radio Kabul gaveno date.</TEXT></DOC>
