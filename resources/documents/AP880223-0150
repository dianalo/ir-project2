Thomas Connor, 30, of Aldan, Pa., tested positive for marijuanain his blood and urine, the Federal Railroad Administration saidafter receiving results from the Center for Human Toxicology at theUniversity of Utah.   In addition, there was evidence of cocaine and methamphetaminein Connor's urine, but the levels were so low that the FRA declinedto even say they represented a ``positive'' finding under normalcircumstances.   Connor, who has since resigned, was on duty in a control towerwhen the train struck a work vehicle in Chester, Pa., nearPhiladelphia, injuring 25 people on the train. Officials said heleft his post after realizing he had failed to take the train off astretch of track undergoing maintenance.   Connor did not submit to blood or urine tests until more than 72hours after the accident. For that reason, the FRA said itinstructed the laboratory to test the specimens to seek the``smallest detectable amount,'' even if it fell below the normalreporting range.   FRA Administrator John Riley said the case illustrated theimportance of urine and blood tests being conducted on members oftrain crews involved in major accidents. That program was struckdown two weeks ago by the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, andthe Reagan administration is appealing.   `` Under the provisions of the recent 9th Circuit decision, itis unlikely that we could have performed these tests. Neither wenor the National Transportation Safety Board would have the benefitof the information the tests were able to provide,'' Riley said.   Arthur Donato, Connor's attorney, was said to be in a meetingand unavailable for comment Tuesday.   Marijuana can remain in the system and be detected for as longas 30 days after use. Cocaine and amphetamines have much shorterdetection ranges _ roughly two to five days and two to seven days,respectively.   The tests found Connor had 89 nanograms per mililiter ofmarijuana in his urine. A nanogram is one billionth of a gram. Itnormally takes a finding of at least 20 nanograms per mililiter toconfirm the presence of the drug.   FRA spokesman Bill Loftus declined to interpret the findings,but said they will be considered in investigations of the accidentby his agency and the NTSB.   ``This does not determine what level may have been in his systemat the time of the accident. It does not determine impairment. Itdoes not determine cause,'' Loftus said.   An assistant conductor on the Amtrak train also tested positivefor marijuana, but he was not believed to have had played any rolein the accident, the FRA said.</TEXT></DOC>
