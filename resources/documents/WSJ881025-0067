First Boston Corp. and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. now stand shoulder to shoulder with Drexel Burnham Lambert in the work of turning the established norms of corporate finance upside down. Ironically, Mr. Milken has never been nearer the center of the financial establishment than he is in the hour of his legal crisis.    Mr. Milken, in fact, is not the revolutionary figure he may seem to be. The financial story of the 20th century is the relaxation of lending standards. It was Mr. Milken's bright idea that up-and-coming businesses deserved to shop for capital in the public bond market. It was a democratic idea, much as A.P. Giannini's turn-of-the-century faith in the creditworthiness of the working man was democratic (practicing what he preached, Giannini built what became BankAmerica). It was in a similarly progressive spirit that the Federal Reserve System was created in 1913, that installment credit was embraced in the 1920s and that a federally guaranteed home-mortgage market was developed in the 1930s. Mr. Milken, as seen by his many friends, is the reincarnation of the Jimmy Stewart character from the movie &quot;It's a Wonderful Life&quot; -- a little richer than Stewart's building-and-loan president, but just as determined to put borrowed money to work for the betterment of mankind.    Thus, the new-era investment bankers ask: What's wrong with corporate leverage? What's the matter with speculative-grade debt? What's wrong with pushing a good idea to limits undreamed of only a few years ago? Nothing, a free-market man may say, and supply-side intellectuals have rallied around the junk-bond king.    But the financial case against junk bonds is really a case against their proliferation. It is a case built on the observed laws of crowd psychology -- on the tendency of people in markets to do the right thing at the wrong time, and specifically of lenders to say &quot;yes&quot; when they ought to say &quot;no.&quot; It is a case built on what might be called the credit cycle.    Have you ever bought at the bottom of a market or sold at the top? Do you remember how hard that was? Do you remember how lonely you felt? The human impulse is to sell at the bottom, when people are fearful, and to buy at the top, when everyone is bullish. In the credit markets nowadays, optimism is rampant, and that is the irony of the Drexel Burnham affair. Even as Mr. Milken is charged by the SEC, so is he emulated by Wall Street. At what will certainly prove to be an inopportune moment, junk bonds have become legitimate.    Financial legitimacy is a hazardous mantle. The logic of a particular investment is never so clear and compelling as at the top of a market. Gold, for instance, which was outside the pale of serious discussion at $35 an ounce, entered the investment mainstream at $600 and $700 an ounce. So with financial leverage. In 1982, at the bottom of the last recession (when we all should have borrowed the down payment on an American corporation), the Harvard Business Review published a cautionary essay on corporate leverage. In 1988, some five years into the expansion, the Review has struck a decidedly more optimistic note, publishing, for instance, an essay bearing the unforgettable title, &quot;Why not leverage your company to the hilt?&quot;    The proposed $20 billion dollar RJR Nabisco buy-out would seem to suggest an answer: &quot;There is no good reason not to leverage your company to the hilt, and beyond.&quot; Prosperity should make lenders guarded, as bad times always follow good, but in fact it makes them unguarded. In October 1933, the Review (then bearish on debt, as you might imagine) put its finger on the problem. &quot;The history of business cycles,&quot; said an essay by George W. Edwards, &quot;shows that the stage of prosperity in general is marked by an ever increasing inefficiency. In the field of security investment, the buying public, swayed by overoptimism, seeks more and more after securities of higher yield, and investment bankers, under the stress of competition, issue securities of higher yield, greater risk and poorer quality.&quot;    The 1930s produced extensive research into the credit experience of the 1920s, and the findings bear directly on the credit history of the 1980s (and of the prospective experience of the 1990s). One conclusion is especially pertinent. It is that securities issued late in the 1920s defaulted at a significantly higher rate than those that were issued early in the 1920s. And so today, as financial innovation succeeds, imitators sweep in. Under the press of competition, lending standards slip. Critics fall silent (they cried wolf too soon) and investors, reaching for yield, demand more of what the investment bankers have to sell. The investment bankers oblige.    In 1956, the business-cycle theorist Geoffrey Moore identified the financial symptoms that had been associated with credit troubles in the past: &quot;First and foremost is a rapid increase in the volume of credit and debt. Second, a rapid, speculative increase in the prices of the assets that are bought with the rapidly expanding credit, such as real estate, common stocks or commodity inventories. Third, vigorous competition among lenders for new business. Fourth, relaxation of credit terms or standards. Fifth, a reduction in the risk premiums sought or obtained by lenders.&quot;    The list is as familiar-sounding as yesterday's Wall Street Journal. The ratio of nonfinancial debt to gross national product has risen and the ratio of corporate earnings to interest expense has fallen. The stock market has crashed, but the prices of corporate takeover targets -- the most visible class of asset being purchased with debt -- have climbed, sometimes to the point of appalling even would-be acquirers. (After losing the bidding war for Federated Stores to Campeau Corp. last spring, Edward Finkelstein, chairman of R.H. Macy andamp; Co., actually expressed relief.) Recently, the Federal Reserve disclosed a sharp rise in the volume of sub-investment-grade corporate loans offered for sale by banks to other banks in the past two years -- a case of banks, to quote George Edwards, &quot;under the stress of competition,&quot; making loans of &quot;higher yield, greater risk and poorer quality.&quot;    So much money has been made by breaking the old rules that lenders and borrowers have become overly confident. What the standard junk-bond prospectus tells an investor is that, unless the borrower can sell assets or refinance its debts at some future date, the bondholders may never see their money again. The prospectus will say that the issuing company must produce significantly greater cash flow in the future than it has in the past, merely to stay out of the soup. The propectus will imply, and sometimes state, that the issuing company expects no business recession for the next five or 10 years. Surely, before not too many years have passed, such passages will be read into the record of a congressional committee with utter incredulity all around.    So bold have the investment bankers become that the balance sheet of a newly leveraged corporation (particularly a fledgling leveraged buyout) often resembles a bankrupt's. High debt, low cash, low or negative net worth, nonexistent interest coverages -- all are common to the Chapter 11 case and the LBO alike. What distinguishes the two is the investment banker's projections -- guarded and bullish, respectively.    My personal favorite (at least until the spate of GNP-sized deals) was USG Corp., formerly U.S. Gypsum, the wallboard company that for 46 years was under the guidance of the legendary financial and political conservative Sewel L. Avery. (It was Avery who was carried bodily from his office by government officers while serving in another corporate capacity, that of chairman of Montgomery Ward, in 1944.) Last summer, escaping an unwanted takeover, USG effected a leveraged recapitalization. The resulting balance sheet showed net worth of minus $1.6 billion and long-term debt of $3.1 billion. The cost of the long-dated public debt was 13 1/4%. Housing is a cyclical business, but you wouldn't know it from reading USG's projections of future sales in 1988-1992 -- there's never a down year.    USG may succeed, and the bondholders may get their money back with interest, but I wonder what Avery would think. Under the old mossback's command, U.S. Gypsum in the Depression year of 1933 presented a balance sheet that looked like Fort Knox. Gypsum showed a current ratio (current assets to current liabilities) of 14.5:1 and a ratio of equity to assets of 98%. In 1988, not a depression year, the new Gypsum showed a current ratio of 1.6:1 and a ratio of equity to assets of minus 71%.    For the record, the new Gypsum's investment bankers are Salomon Brothers and Goldman Sachs, not Drexel Burnham. It is a sign of the times that Drexel's competitors have more and more made Drexel seem a piker. It is equally revealing that almost nobody seems to be worried by that.    ---   Mr. Grant is the editor of Grant's Interest Rate Observer.
