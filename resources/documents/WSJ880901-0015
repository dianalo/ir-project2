We have now completed our evaluation and we do not have an interest in purchasing all or part of Short Brothers,&quot; said Frank Shrontz, Boeing's chairman.    Boeing, an aerospace and defense contracting concern, purchased commuter aircraft maker de Havilland of Canada Ltd. from the Canadian government in 1986. Boeing said at the time that it expected more of its jet airline customers to begin buying the commuter aircraft made by de Havilland. But many larger airlines have been signing pacts with individual commuter lines coordinating short-haul and long-haul service around major hub airports. </TEXT></DOC>
