The international agencyadds that the number of poor people could be cut as much as40% by the end of the century if poor countries provideincome-earning opportunities and basic social services.   In the meantime, developed countries should maintain orincrease their levels of aid, the World Bank says in itsannual development report. But the aid should be tightlylinked to a country's efforts to reduce poverty, the reportadvises.</LP><TEXT>   More than half of the poorest peoples live in South Asia,in countries such as India and Bangladesh, with most of theremainder living in East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.   The report, which is being released today, focuses onpoverty. It sets out a dual strategy for improving the lot ofthe world's poor-people who survive on about a dollar a dayor less.   But for poverty to be reduced appreciably, many developingcountries will have to alter their current policies, the banksays. It is scathing about some strategies: &quot;Many pastpolicies meant to benefit the rural poor have failed; landreform barely helped the poor, except after wars orrevolutions; subsidized credit programs not only benefitedthe rich much more than the poor but ran into seriousdebt-repayment problems; and excessive taxation ofagriculture contributed to poor results.&quot;   Too often, the report says, formal social security plansand health policies have failed to benefit the poorestpeople. It says that targeted food subsidies often workbetter than general food subsidies, and also recommendspublic-employment programs.   Through such policies, some countries have had remarkablesuccess in shrinking poverty. For example, Indonesia reducedthe share of its population living in poverty to less than20% from 60% in less than a generation, according to LynSquire, who led the team that authored the report.   Controlling population growth is another challenge facingthe poorest countries. The World Bank estimates that another850 million people will be born in the remainder of thedecade. In sub-Saharan Africa in particular, fast populationgrowth threatens to worsen poverty.   Donor countries too, will have to make sure they provideenough aid to countries making serious efforts to reducepoverty, the report says. On current projections, aid isexpected to increase 2% a year, according to the Paris-basedOrganization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Thatimplies aid will total $64 billion in the year 2000, up 25%from $51 billion in 1988.   World Bank President Barber Conable told reportersrecently that as &quot;the Cold War wanes, developed countries canafford more aid.&quot; He added that if developed countries cuttheir military spending by 10% they could double their aid.&quot;   If donor countries were more generous and pegged their aidat the &quot;widely accepted&quot; level of 0.7% of gross nationalproduct, aid could increase to as much as $144 billion by theend of the century, the World Bank says. Among rich nations,Saudi Arabia, the Scandinavian countries and Holland are themost generous when aid is measured as a percentage of GNP.Saudi Arabia's aid in 1988 totaled 2.7% of national output,the World Bank says. Ireland and the U.S. are the leastgenerous, with aid totaling about 0.2% of GNP, theinternational agency says, quoting OECD figures.</TEXT></DOC>
