Nomani   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>02/05/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B1</SO><CO>   NWA</CO><IN>AIRLINES (AIR)</IN><LP>   Air fares appear poised to climb for the fourth time insix months.   NWA Inc.'s Northwest Airlines has quietly slipped a $15round-trip surcharge on domestic fares, effective Friday, asthe airline seeks to counter rising costs related to theMideast war.</LP><TEXT>   The move almost certainly will trigger a pricing debatewithin an industry reeling from sharply higher costs and adrastic falloff in traffic. Carriers already have increasedfares nationwide three times since Iraq invaded Kuwait Aug.2, and the first of those pricing actions followed an attemptby Northwest to impose a surcharge.   Other major carriers didn't indicate whether they willfollow Northwest's planned move. But when Northwest lastproposed a surcharge, rivals used it as a springboard toraise the price of fares.   Northwest's planned surcharge would amount to an averagefare increase of 3.5%, according to one analysis. In someinstances, though, the fare boost would be heftier. The pricefor Northwest's cheapest regular ticket between New York andBoston would rise 9.2% to $178 from $163. The surchargeamounts to $7.50 on one-way fares.   The added fee, which Northwest is coining an &quot;operationalsurcharge,&quot; came to light after the airline filed it as arule change in the industry's computer reservation systems, adata base for the fares that airlines offer.   In a computer message to travel agents, Northwest said,&quot;The operational surcharge will provide a consistent revenuesource to partially meet escalated costs that have impactedthe airline as a result of hostilities in the Middle East.&quot;   The airline is citing higher jet fuel and security costssince Aug. 2. Closely held Northwest's fourth-quarter resultsaren't available, but UAL Corp.'s United Airlines unitreported an almost doubling in the average price per gallonit paid for fuel during the fourth quarter vs. the year-agolevel.   Although fuel costs have abated somewhat since war began,most airlines are arguing that their expenses are stillhigher than normal.   The higher security costs appear to be a result of tightersecurity measures mandated by the Federal AviationAdministration. Those measures have been in response tothreats by Saddam Hussein of terrorism against U.S. targets.Airports and airline flights are considered particularlyvulnerable.   The unusually high costs have prompted a shakeout in theindustry. Continental Airlines Holdings Inc. and Pan Am Corp.have sought Chapter 11 bankruptcy court protection fromcreditors. Most recently, Eastern Airlines ceased operations.   The industry's financial plight is even softening criticstypically outspoken against air fare increases. &quot;For God'ssake, I'll take a $15 surcharge rather than see the countrywind up with three airline conglomerates that set prices anyway they want,&quot; said Peter Tanous, part-owner of Frequentmagazine, a publication for travelers.   Northwest, in particular, has been under pressure, becausea $3.65 billion buyout of its NWA parent in 1989 left thecompany loaded with debt.   In its message to travel agents, Northwest said thesurcharge will help the airline &quot;offer its full domesticflight schedule.&quot; It said the surcharge &quot;is not a permanentrevision to the pricing structure and will be reviewedperiodically to determine if adjustments should be made.&quot;   Northwest is gambling the surcharge will generate enoughextra revenue to offset any drop in traffic.</TEXT></DOC>
