Wright set the vote for Tuesday. The Senate was expected toquickly give its assent and sent legislation halting the raise, dueto take effect at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday, to President Bush. SenateRepublican leader Bob Dole said he expects Bush to sign it.   The vote, Wright said, will be on ``a simple resolution ofdisapproval'' of the raises, which would also affect federal judgesand top executive branch officials.   Wright had planned to let the raise take effect Wednesday, thenhave the House vote the next day to scale it back to 30 percent.Members of Congress would have seen their annual salaries jump, atleast temporarily, from $89,500 to $135,000.   The speaker relented after opponents won a dramatic vote to keepthe issue alive on the House floor. He said the chamber will voteTuesday and promised, ``The majority will rule.''   The resolution would then go to the Senate, which voted 95-5Thursday for a differently worded rejection measure.   That chamber's majority leader, Sen. George J. Mitchell, D-Maine,said he ``hopes and expects to bring up whatever the House sendsover'' and send it to the president before the raise becomes law,according to Mitchell aides.   Bush, at a late afternoon news conference, was asked, ``Would yousign a bill that vetoes the pay raise, not only for the members ofCongress, but also for federal judges and other high officials inthe government?''   He answered, in an apparent reference to the pay raise, ``I saidI would support it.''   But Mitchell's Republican counterpart, Sen. Bob Dole, R-Kan.,told reporters:   ``I understand he'll sign it. He needs to do it by midnight sothe judiciary doesn't get a big step while everybody else is beingstepped on.''   The Constitution forbids raises for judges from being reducedonce they take effect.   Wright's turnaround came after pay raise opponents mustered a238-88 majority against a House Democratic leadership motion toadjourn.   ``The majority has spoken, and the majority will speakemphatically,'' Wright said afterwords.   One leading opponent of the raise, consumer advocate Ralph Nader,said Wright's capitulation showed he had realized ``that the powerof the people is greater than the power of his tyranny in (tryingto) close down the House of Representatives until the members gottheir salary increase.''   The chairman of the House Democratic Caucus, Rep. Bill Gray,D-Pa., predicted there would be ``no pay raise, no change'' in thelawmakers' salary. Gray also said he doubted the House would move toban speaking fees and other honoraria _ a plan favored by Wright inreturn for the raise.   Gray said members feared a vote to end Monday's debate andadjourn ``was going to be interpreted as a vote on the pay raise.''He said any vote to increase lawmakers' salary now would fail. Even``if it's a vote on 4 percent, it ain't going to pass,'' Gray added.   ``This pay raise is dead,'' said Rep. Thomas Tauke, R-Iowa, anarchitect of the opposition strategy.   Tauke, however, said he expects Congress to take up the issuelater, along with a review of honoraria, often paid to members byspecial interests seeking to influence legislation.   The vote and Wright's subsequent announcement came after MajorityLeader Thomas Foley, D-Wash., presiding over Monday's session,refused to recognize a pay-raise opponent who wanted to introduce aresolution calling for a vote on the hike.   That set the stage for more than 30 minutes of barbed debatebetween the two sides.   From the start, the House electronic tote board showed theadjournment motion, by House Majority Whip Tony Coelho, D-Calif.,was losing.   Wright last week conducted a private survey of House members andsaid the results showed they did not want a vote before the raisetook effect. Despite that, random surveys by The Associated Pressand other organizations showed sentiment in favor of a vote.   A weekend Gallup poll indicated overwhelming public opposition tothe pay raise. The Gallup organization asked 1,001 adults fromFriday through Sunday whether they favored or opposed increasingcongressional pay from $89,500 to $135,000. The results, with a 4percent margin of error, showed 82 percent opposed it with only 15percent in favor.   Meanwhile, the president of the American Bar Association,addressing the group's convention in Denver, urged members to calltheir congressmen to register their support for the pay raise forjudges. Robert Raven, the association's president, then gave hislisteners the phone number of the congressional switchboard.   Besides the raise for members of Congress, the presidentialcommission proposed:   _Increasing the president's pay from $200,000 to $350,000 and thevice president's from $115,000 to $175,000. The raises would notaffect President Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle.   _Raising the salaries of top federal officials, now in the rangeof $75,500 to $99,500, to a range of $115,000 to $155,000.   _Hiking the salary of the chief justice from $115,000 to $175,000and the salaries of associate justices of the Supreme Court from$110,000 to $165,000.   _Raising the pay of federal appellate judges from $95,000 to$140,000 and that of federal district judges from $89,500 to$135,000.   Retired congressmen, presidents, vice presidents, top federalofficials and other federal judges would also receive higherpensions under the commission's proposal.</TEXT></DOC>
