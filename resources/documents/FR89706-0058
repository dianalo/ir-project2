Switzer Building, Washington,DC 20202-6510. Telephone: (202) 732-5063.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Authority for the Transitional BilingualEducation (TBE) and the Special Alternative Instructional (SAI) programsis found in Section 7021 of the Bilingual Education Act of 1984, as amended(20 U.S.C. 3291). Under both the TBE and SAI programs, awards are madeto local educational agencies (LEAs) to provide programs of instructionfor limited English proficient (LEP) children. Bilingual instructional programs have been funded by the Federal governmentfor over 20 years in an effort to ensure equal educational opportunityfor all students. In recent years some school districts have had heavyinfluxes of immigrant and refugee populations. The Secretary is aware thatthese districts have a substantial burden because of the influx of LEPstudents from these new groups, and believes that they should be able toapply for additional Federal assistance under existing programs and appropriations.Also, the Secretary desires that a priority to assist these students applyto both TBE and SAI programs to provide LEPs with flexibility in determiningappropriate to provide LEAs with flexibility in determining appropriateinstructional approaches. Using available funds to implement this prioritywill in no way diminish FY 1989 funding levels for other TBE and SAI program,since the funds at issue for this special competition would be allocatedto programs authorized by section 7021 of the Act other than TBE and SAIprograms, even if the priority were not implemented.On March 7, 1989, the Secretary published a notice of proposed priorityfor this special competition in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> (54 FR 9545-9546).There are major substantive differences between the notice of proposedpriority and this final notice. In response to public comments on the noticeof proposed priority, and to clarify the original intent, the Secretaryhs deleted the requirement that an applicant must not previously have providedservices with TBE or SAI funds received from the Department in the nativelanguage of those students to be served in the proposed project. In addition,the Secretary has limited the priority to applicants proposing to servechildren who have arrived in the school district within the last two years,and applicants who demonstrated in their application to the Secretary thatthose children represent excess burden to the school district.<ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Comments and Changes</ITAG>In response to the Secretary's invitation in the notice of proposed priority,67 parties submitted comments. An analysis of the comments and of the changesin the priority since publication of the notice of proposed priority follows.Native Language Limitation<T3>Comments:</T3> Many commenters were concerned about the restrictionof the proposed priority to LEAs that had not previously provided serviceswith TBE or SAI funds in the native language of the students to be served.Commenters pointed out that many school districts with a substantial needfor Federal assistance, as a result of recent influxes of immigrant andrefugee populations, would not be eligible for assistance because of theirpast services in the native languages of these populations.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The purpose of Federal assistance under the TBE andSAI programs is to build the capacity of LEAs to continue programs forLEP students after Federal funding ends. Thus LEAs funded in the past shouldhave developed the capacity to conduct programs for groups whose nativelanguages were previously served with TBE and SAI funds. The Secretaryrecognizes, however, that in some school districts capacity-building effortshave been heavily burdened by influxes of immigrant and refugee populations,and he agrees that these heavily affected LEAs should be able to applyfor assistance to help them ensure equal educational opportunities forLEP students who have recently arrived in the districts.<T3>Changes:</T3> The Secretary has deleted the reference to native languagein the proposed priority and has limited the priority to LEAs proposingto serve LEP students who have arrived in the school districts within thelast two years.Adequacy of Existing Competitive Priorities<T3>Comments:</T3> Several Commenters questioned the need for the proposedpriority since statutory preference already exists for LEAs needing Federalassistance to serve language groups that have not previously received serviceswith TBE or SAI funds. These commenters suggested that the needs of underservedLEP children are met through the existing process of assigning additionalpoints to competing applications that present additional factors for theSecretary to consider in awarding grants.<T3>Discussion:</T3> In the past, the additional points have not provenadequate to ensure that historically underserved populations have receivedadequate funding.<ITAG tagnum="20">(</ITAG><T3>See,</T3> 20 U.S.C. 3291 and 34 CFR 501.32.)<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Eligibility of New Grade Levels for Previously Served Language Groups<T3>Comments:</T3> Several commenters criticized the proposed priorityas discriminatory against LEAs that have previously provided services inthe native language of students at certain grade levels but now need assistanceto serve students of the same language group at other grade levels. Onecommenter maintained that capacity building at the elementary grade levelsdoes not enable an LEA to serve the same language group at the secondarygrade levels because program components developed for the lower gradesare not adequate or appropriate for influxes of LEP students in the uppergrades.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The capacity developed in establishing a program atone educational level should ordinarily be transferable to another educationallevel involving the same language group. The Secretary is concerned, however,that recent influxes of immigrant and refugee populations have impairedthe ability of some prior grantees to expand services for previously servedlanguage groups to additional grade levels.<T3>Changes:</T3> As noted above, the Secretary has deleted the referenceto native language in the proposed priority.Effect of the Proposed Priority on the Earlier FY 1989 TBE and SAI GrantCompetitions<T3>Comments:</T3> Several commenters were concerned that the awardingof grants under the proposed priority would reduce the number of awardsplanned for the TBE and SAI programs under the regular FY 1989 grant competitionsheld earlier.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Awarding of grants under the proposed priority willnot have this effect, since the funds for the priority will come from reallocatedFY 1989 funds originally planned for other programs.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Impact of the Proposed Priority on Instructional Methodology<T3>Comments:</T3> The Secretary received several comments criticizingthe proposed priority as an attempt to foster a specific approach in theeducation of LEP children.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The proposed priority applies to applications proposingapproaches under either the TBE program or the SAI program. Thus, the priorityallows applicants maximum flexibility to determine whether bilingual orEnglish-only methods of instruction are appropriate for children in theirdistricts.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Relationship of the Proposed Priority to Native American Needs<T3>Comments:</T3> Several commenters expressed concern that the awardingof grants under the proposed priority would divert Federal assistance fromNative American language groups and signify a lessening of interest inprograms for these groups.<T3>Discussion:</T3> Under the proposed priority the Secretary does notintend to exclude Native American or other language groups from consideration,but rather gives preference to applicants with special needs. Awardingof grants under this priority is unlikely to have any significant effecton funding for Native American projects.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.Adequacy of Existing Programs to Meet the Needs Addressed by the ProposedPriority<T3>Comments:</T3> A few commenters noted the existence of other programs,such as under the Emergency Immigrant Education Act and the Refugee AssistanceAct, that they felt addressed the Secretary's concerns about serving newstudent populations.<T3>Discussion:</T3> The priority makes possible an additional responseto recent influxes, over and above that of any of the formula grant programsand would provide specific assistance for bilingual education. This priorityis made possible this year by the availability of funds and recognitionof the priority need. It is not intended at this time to be a regular supplementto the immigrant and refugee program.<T3>Changes:</T3> None.<T3>Priority:</T3> In accordance with the Education Department GeneralAdministrative Regulations in 34 CFR 75.105(c)(3), the Secretary establishesthe following absolute priority in FY 1989 for applications under the TBEand SAI programs:The LEA must propose to provide instructional services to LEP studentswhom it has not previously served under TBE or SAI programs funded by theDepartment. Additionally, these students must have arrived in the applicant'sdistrict within two years prior to the date of the application to the Departmentfor funds under this competition.<ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Review</ITAG>This program is subject to the requirements of Executive Order 12372 andthe regulations in 34 CFR Part 79. The objective of the Executive Orderis to foster an intergovernmental partnership and a strengthened federalismby relying on processes developed by State and local governments for coordinationand review of proposed Federal financial assistance.In accordance with the order, this document is intended to provide earlynotification of the Department's specific plans and actions for this program.<ITAG tagnum="20">(Authority: 20 U.S.C. 3291)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: June 29, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Lauro F.
