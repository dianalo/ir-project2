The latest results are in contrast to the sensational currency trading profits in the 1987 fourth period. Five out of nine big banks reporting saw foreign exchange profits plummet from the fourth quarter. A sixth bank, Bankers Trust Co., a unit of Bankers Trust New York Corp., incurred a loss from currency trading. In the fourth quarter, it led U.S. banks with record foreign exchange earnings of $337.7 million before taxes and expenses.    The first quarter was especially difficult for currency traders, according to bank foreign exchange managers. Exchange rates stayed in a relatively narrow range for most of the period, minimizing dealers' opportunities to make trading profits.    &quot;If you have a small change in exchange rates, its very hard to make a lot of money,&quot; says Christine W. Patton, senior vice president of foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, a unit of Manufacturers Hanover Corp.    Moreover, big banks that trade aggressive positions for their own accounts are believed to have been badly bruised when the dollar abruptly changed course and rose sharply in early January before leveling off. &quot;The dollar looked as if it was going to fall to Earth and then it turned back up. I have to believe that a lot of people got caught&quot; in the reversal, says the head of trading at a major New York bank.    At the same time, banks whose foreign exchange businesses are reliant on providing foreign exchange for corporate customers saw their trading profits fare comparatively better than the large &quot;position&quot; banks.    Bankers Trust, one of the most aggressive banks in trading for its own account, had a $19.4 million first-quarter foreign exchange loss, its first quarterly loss from currency trading since at least 1970, according to a spokesman. The spokesman declined to comment on the loss, but noted that the bank had said that its fourth-period trading profit was unusually high and wasn't expected to be repeated.    Others in the market speculate that Bankers Trust had problems managing a complex currency options portfolio previously handled by a top currency trader, Andrew J. Krieger, who left the bank in the first quarter.    Morgan Guaranty Trust Co., New York, a unit of J.P. Morgan andamp; Co., Inc., experienced the second sharpest drop in trading gains. Its foreign exchange profit fell 57%, to $38.5 million, from $89.1 million in the fourth period. &quot;As a bank that's basically in the business of taking positions, stable markets present less opportunities for making money,&quot; a bank spokesman says.    The sharpest rise in trading profits came at Manufacturers Hanover, where earnings climbed 36% to $35.9 million from $26.4 million in the fourth period. &quot;While there were a limited number of moves in the market, we seemed to have capitalized on all of them,&quot; Ms. Patton says. She said Manufacturers also profitably expanded its trading relationships with other banks.    Chase Manhattan Corp., had the next largest increase; its foreign exchange earnings rose 25% to $78.5 million from $62.6 million in the fourth quarter. &quot;The majority of our business is customer driven. We don't take the same large bets that other banks take,&quot; a spokesman says.    ---                      Money Center Banks                   Foreign Exchange Profits                              1Q 1988           %Change                        (In millions)       1Q'88/4Q'87    BankAmerica                 $25.0            -44.4%    Bankers Trust               -19.4               --    Chase Manhattan              78.5             25.4    Chemical New York            34.4            -29.7    Citicorp                    166.0              6.4    Continental Illinois          8.1            -11.0    First Chicago                36.2            -31.4    Manufacturers Hanover        35.9             36.0    J.P.
