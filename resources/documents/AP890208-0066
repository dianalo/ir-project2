(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A judge has warned Berenice Rogersto slip out of her high heels before strolling around her condo.   Palm Beach County Circuit Judge Richard Burk said Tuesday that ifRogers persists in annoying her downstairs neighbors with her noisyfootsteps, she could be pacing inside a jail cell.   Bernard and Sonja Arbuse, who live directly below Rogers at theSun and Surf Condominium, said the problem began in 1984 when Rogershad Italian tile laid in her $235,000 condo.   The couple's attorney, Charles Nugent, requested Burk to orderRogers to install carpeting.   Rogers said she laid Oriental and sheepskin rugs and removes herheels at the front door, but she does not want carpet.   ``I don't believe Mrs. Rogers is required to give up her right todecorate,'' the judge said. ``And I don't believe I can require herto stop walking.''</TEXT></DOC>
