SWAPO is favored to outpoll nine other parties in a five-day,United Nations-supervised election starting Tuesday for 72 seats inan assembly that will draft a constitution for independent Namibia.   South African President F.W. de Klerk urged Namibians to ``castyour vote in the interest of peace and prosperity.''   ``The strife and bitterness, the mistrust and misunderstandingsof the past must be put behind us,'' he said.   An airplane chartered by SWAPO's main rival, the DemocraticTurnhalle Alliance, to broadcast political messages was forced downby gunfire Monday, but otherwise authorities reported calmthroughout the arid, sparsely populated territory.   Police said the single-engine plane crash-landed and caught fireafter being hit by bullets over the northern region of Kavango. Thetwo men aboard the plane were not seriously hurt, and a hunt forthe attackers was launched, police said.   Fred Eckhard, chief spokesman for the U.N. monitoring force,said officials were nervous because ``there is a deep-seated mutualdistrust on the part of supporters of different parties.''   ``The peace is a fragile peace,'' Eckhard said.   Posters and TV advertisements financed by U.N. and territorialofficials have been stressing that ballots will be secret andurging the 701,453 registered voters to ``vote without fear.''   SWAPO is the overwhelming front-runner, and the key question iswhether it will win two-thirds of the votes, which would allow itto draft a constitution without compromising with other parties.   ``The day has finally arrived when Nambians will vote forfreedom,'' said SWAPO President Sam Nujoma, who spent 30 years inexile.   Both Nujoma and de Klerk said they were prepared to accept theresults of the election, regardless of the outcome, as long as theU.N.'s chief representative, Martti Ahtisaari, certified that thevoting was free and fair.   Nujoma said ``Namibian patriots'' of other parties would beinvited to join a SWAPO-led government. But he ruled out a role forDirk Mudge, a white moderate who is the best-known leader of theDemocratic Turnhalle Alliance.   The alliance is a multiracial coalition which participated in aSouth African-installed transitional government.   Nambia was colonized by Germany in 1884, and captured by SouthAfrica in 1915. South Africa agreed last year to grant independenceas part of a regional treaty that also calls for the phasedwithdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, Namibia's northern neighbor.   Last week, South African Foreign Minister Pik Botha raised thepossibility of delaying the elections when he alleged that SWAPOguerrillas had mobilized along the Angola-Namibian border for atreaty-breaking incursion into the territory. Botha later admittedhis charge was based on false radio messages and said prospects forfree and fair elections were good.   Some opposition politicians and newspapers in South Africa havedemanded Botha's resignation, and there have been calls for aninvestigation of the possibility that he was duped by right-wingelements in the military who sought to undermine the Namibianelections.   U.N. election officials said votes will be cast at 358 pollingstations, including 143 mobile booths sent to remote areas. Finalresults are expected by the end of next week.   The voting will be monitored by 1,695 U.N. supervisers, alongwith observers from at least 25 foreign countries andrepresentatives of the Namibian political parties.   The U.N. force will remain in Namibia until independence,expected early next year. But Eckhard said other U.N. agencieswould take over trying to track down more than 300 missingNamibians who allegedly were detained by SWAPO at prison camps inAngola and Zambia.   At the United Nations on Monday, Secretary-General Javier Perezde Cuellar noted that there have been 120,000 gun permits issuedand said he was concerned about a possible outbreak of violenceafter the election.   ``While, at this time, there have been marked improvements inthe security situation on the eve of the election, I remainvigilant to the possibility of a deterioration in the field of lawand order,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
