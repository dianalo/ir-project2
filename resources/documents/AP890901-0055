WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Thousands of East Germans who fled toHungary will be allowed to travel to West Germany in the next fewdays, government sources and an opposition party official say.   West German Karsten Voigt, foreign affairs expert for theopposition Social Democrats, said in Budapest Thursday that seniorHungarian officials confirmed to him they plan to let out all EastGermans who want to leave for West Germany.   About 10 percent of the 150,000 to 200,000 East Germansvacationing in Hungary are thought to be seeking passage to WestGermany, and Bonn and Budapest have agreed to help them, thegovernment sources said on condition of anonymity.   Hungary and East Germany are ruled by communist governments andare in the Soviet camp. However, Hungary has embraced Western-stylereforms while East Germany has shunned them.   In Vienna, Austrian officials confirmed that Bonn asked them toarrange for special rail transportation for up to 20,000 EastGermans.   Voigt discussed the situation in Budapest on Thursday withHungary's Communist Party president, Rezso Nyers, and ForeignMinistry officials.   Hungary will let the East Germans out under the auspices of theRed Cross or some other international humanitarian organization,Voigt told the West German ZDF television network.   ``I was told this could only be a one-time thing. And it iscertainly important for the East German leadership to tolerate sucha solution if not support it,'' he said.   The apparent plan to allow East Germans out of Hungary withoutthe usual documents authorizing their departure may have beenintentionally leaked by West German officials earlier Thursday tolet potential emigres in East Germany know about the rare escapeopportunity.   Most areas of East Germany receive Western radio or TV broadcasts.   Asked if Hungary had agreed to allow the escapes during the nextfew days, one West German official told The Associated Press: ``Icannot deny that.''   Officially, Bonn has denied it is working with Hungary to aid theescapees. Foreign Ministry spokesman Peter Rothen described reportsof the plan as ``pure speculation.''   However, Austrian Railways officials in Vienna told TheAssociated Press they were asked by Bonn to ready railroad cars fora mass transport of refugees from the Hungarian border on Sept. 6.   One official said he expected the exodus sooner, perhaps thisweekend.   Austrian Railways has promised to make up to 50 train carsavailable within six hours at an unspecified border point withHungary, the official said on condition of anonymity.   The Frankfurter Rundschau newspaper said the refugees would beallowed passage to West Germany on the basis of their East Germanvisas for Hungary.   A senior West German Foreign Ministry official, Michael Jansen,has spent this week shuttling among Budapest, Vienna and Prague.Hungary's Foreign Minister Gyula Horn visited East Berlin onThursday.   The illegal exodus of at least 6,000 East Germans through Hungarythis summer has strained relations between the two Warsaw Pactallies, as well as between East Germany and West Germany.   East German state media have accused Bonn of enticing workers tothe West and have embarked on a propaganda war to scare citizensinto staying.   Unprecedented legal immigration combined with the largest escapespree since 1961, when the Berlin Wall was built, will bring atleast 100,000 East Germans to West Germany this year, theInter-German Affairs Ministry has predicted.   Hungary has become the escape route for many East Germansfrustrated with the lack of reform in their country. It begandismantling its border fortifications with Austria in May as part ofits democratic reforms.   East Germany, a nation of 16 million, suffers a widespread laborshortage. The West German economy is expected to benefit from thenew influx of manual laborers and skilled technicians from EastGermany, including a construction boom to provide housing for thenewcomers.</TEXT></DOC>
