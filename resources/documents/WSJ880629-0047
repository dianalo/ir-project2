The Federal Reserve Bank of New York also sold modest amounts of dollars, but by late New York trading, the U.S. currency had climbed to a six-month high of 132.50 yen from 131.15 yen the day before.    In midmorning trading in Tokyo Wednesday, the dollar was quoted at 133.20 yen.    Traders &quot;will continue to test the resolve of the central banks to mitigate the dollar's rise,&quot; said Jeff Mondschein, foreign-exchange manager at Merrill Lynch International in New York.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 22.41 points as the dollar's gain enhanced the allure of U.S. investments. Commodity prices fell, calming inflation worries. Prices for 30-year Treasury bonds rose more than $10 for each $1,000 face amount as yields slid to about 8 7/8%.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8215 marks, off from 1.8218 late Monday but up from an intraday low of 1.7915. The pound inched up to $1.7091 from $1.7023 in the wake of an interest-rate boost by the Bank of England.    The U.S. intervention wasn't as forceful as that of the Europeans, who fear that a surging dollar could destabilize world financial markets by jeopardizing the hard-won recent narrowing of the huge U.S. trade deficit. West Germans are also concerned about fighting domestic inflation.    In addition, West Germany is expected to raise its discount rate tomorrow.    Traders speculated that there seemed to be a difference of opinion between major industrial countries, with Western Europeans seeking to halt the dollar's rise and the U.S. and, seemingly, Japan willing to let it climb.    Dealers estimated that Europe's central banks -- including those of West Germany, Switzerland, France, Britain, Italy, Belgium and Austria -- sold between $1 billion and $1.5 billion, with the Bundesbank accounting for an estimated $600 million of that. They described the intervention as a coordinated and skillfully executed maneuver to cap or at least slow a rally that began in early June and pushed the dollar up nearly 7% to as high as 1.8300 marks in intraday trading Monday.    &quot;It was a totally concerted effort,&quot; said Trevor N. Cass, foreign-exchange manager at Barclays Bank PLC in London. Dealers said they weren't surprised by the central banks' intervention. But &quot;the extent to which they intervened was a surprise and the fact that it was so concerted,&quot; Mr. Cass said.    Later in the day, the Fed sold dollars as it had done Monday, but one banker called the amounts &quot;nothing much.&quot; Meanwhile, traders said that earlier in Tokyo, Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the country's monetary authorities didn't intend to intervene to stem the dollar's rise at the moment.    The Fed's intervention indicates a show of sympathy for the Europeans' desire to cap the rise in the dollar. Nonetheless, U.S. authorities have indicated their cooperation is more symbolic than substantive and have made it clear that for now, they aren't willing to undertake massive intervention to stop the U.S. currency's rise.    The U.S. reluctance to intervene in force reflects, in part, the Fed's determination to continue its fight against signs of accelerating inflation at home. Fed officials fear that large dollar sales would increase liquidity in the U.S. and call into question their inflation-fighting resolve.    By providing some modest help to the Bundesbank, the Fed may also be trying to prevent substantial increases in West German interest rates. Further increases in German rates could slow the European economy, and thus reduce U.S. exports.    Even so, a source close to the Bundesbank said, &quot;in the U.S., more short-term domestic political considerations are at work than in partner countries of the U.S.&quot; Noting that a stronger dollar would reduce inflationary pressure in the U.S. and enable the Fed possibly to keep interest rates down, he said: &quot;Both factors would be a contribution to the forthcoming election.&quot;    However, he said the West German central bank was taking a longer-term view and feared that a strong dollar &quot;is a risk to the continuous progress in the adjustment process,&quot; of lowering the U.S. trade deficit and correspondingly high West German and Japanese surpluses.    German authorities, he said, &quot;see the (U.S.) budget deficit growing next year and continuing stronger consumer demand; and if there is pressure on U.S. exports from a stronger dollar, you might conclude there are risks to faster improvement in the U.S. current account.&quot;    The current account is the widest trade measure and includes trade in goods and services plus certain unlateral transfers such as interest payments to foreign holders of dollar debt.    The Fed meets today and tomorrow to review its monetary policy. But there is no indication it is considering any easing of its grip on credit.    A big question mark is where the Japanese stand. Japanese authorities are known to be concerned about the inflationary implications of their fast monetary expansion. But Charles Minnaar, a vice president at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, speculated that Tokyo may be putting political considerations -- namely supporting the U.S. -- before domestic monetary concerns.    &quot;Japanese officials still have room to tolerate a weaker yen,&quot; said Shigeru Tokunaga, foreign-exchange manager at Fuji Bank Ltd. in New York. Whether and when the central bank acts, he said, depended on the speed of the dollar's appreciation.    &quot;If the dollar goes up one yen a day or more, the Bank of Japan will intervene,&quot; he predicted. Otherwise, Mr. Tokunaga said: &quot;They won't do anything until (it reaches) 135 yen.&quot;    Meanwhile, the Bank of England yesterday signaled commercial banks in London to raise their base lending rates to 9.5% from 9%. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher attributed the boost to her government's determination to fight inflation. Higher interest rates usually help support a currency by increasing its attraction to investors. Nevertheless, sterling remained relatively weak against the dollar.    &quot;I think we've entered a new phase; it looks like demand for the dollar is very, very strong,&quot; said Klaus Schuermann, chief mark dealer for Commerzbank in Frankfurt. He warned: &quot;If the central banks can't prove to the market they don't like the dollar up, it could go higher.&quot;    Geoffrey Dennis, an international economist at James Capel andamp; Co. in London, said the Bundesbank tomorrow would probably increase its discount rate by half a percentage point to 3% and that Britain may follow suit. Other traders said a German rate boost could be as low as 0.25 point or as high as 0.75 point. Japan, Mr. Dennis said, would probably signal a tighter monetary stance by resorting to discrete boosts in its short-term bill rates, avoiding increasing its discount rate.    He said the Bundesbank was concerned with lowering domestic inflationary expectations and that it didn't want the dollar to go so high that &quot;it chipped away at U.S. competitiveness.&quot; He added: &quot;As long as the dollar keeps rising, there is also a risk that it could come back down again.&quot;    On New York's Commodity Exchange, current-delivery gold settled at $437.50 an ounce, down $5.50. Estimated volume was moderate to high at 4.5 million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $438.25 an ounce in early trading Wednesday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Tuesday, June 28, 1988    Based on average of late afternoon buying and selling rates.
