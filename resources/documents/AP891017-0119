The elections are seen as a test of the durability of theworld's only democratically elected dynasty. Gandhi's family hasgoverned independent India for all but five years of its 42-yearhistory.   Voting will be conducted Nov. 22 and Nov. 24 in all but one ofIndia's 25 states, said Chief Election Commissioner R.V.S. PeriSastri. New elections had been due by mid-January.   Because of the vastness of this country of 880 million people,elections normally are conducted over several days.   At stake are 542 seats in the Lok Sabha, or house of the people,the law-making lower house of Parliament. Gandhi's Congress Partywon 415 seats in the last elections, held in December 1984 twomonths after Sikh bodyguards assassinated Gandhi's mother andpredecessor, Indira Gandhi.   Gandhi's decision to call elections early came on the heels ofnew charges of high-level corruption and his failure to push thetwo amendments through Parliament last week.   Viswanath Pratap Singh, once one of the prime minister'sstaunchest allies and now one of his bitterest rivals, said Gandhihad no choice.   ``By deciding to face the people, the government has been forcedto take the only option available to it,'' said Singh, leader ofthe Janata Dal, or People's Party, one of five opposition groupsthat comprise the often fractious coalition known as the NationalFront.   ``The National Front and the Janata Dal are fully prepared tomeet the challenge posed to the future of the nation by a corrupt,inept and treacherous regime headed by a totally venal and amoralindividual,'' said Singh, who once belonged to Gandhi's CongressParty and served him as defense and finance ministers.   The decision to call fresh elections came abruptly, with Gandhicanceling plans to attend this week's Commonwealth summit inMalaysia and summoning his Cabinet.   ``The decision is a culmination of political developments afterthe constitutional amendment bills failed to get the requisitetwo-thirds majority,'' said an official source, speaking oncondition of anonymity. ``The government also wanted to scotchrumors that it was considering postponing the election.''   Sources said Gandhi and the Congress Party wanted to turn theelection into a referendum on the two bills he had campaigned hardfor, only to see them fall three votes short of the necessarytwo-thirds majority Friday. The bills were proposed constitutionalamendments that Gandhi said would give more power to village andmunicipal governments.   Singh and other opposition politicians, however, said the billswere intended to consolidate federal power at the expense of stategovernments.   Gandhi, a 45-year-old former airline pilot, has been dogged formore than two years by opposition and newspaper charges that peopleclose to him and his party received up to $50 million in kickbacksfrom the Swedish arms manufacturer, AB Bofors, to secure a 1986contract to sell $1.4 billion worth of artillery guns to India.   Gandhi has repeatedly denied he profited from the deal andinsisted no Indians received commissions. But newspaper reportshave alleged the money was funneled to a series of companies whoseownerships are largely a mystery.</TEXT></DOC>
