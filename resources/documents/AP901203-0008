Columbia's seven-member crew also includes four astronomers whowill take turns manning the $150 million Astro observatory. Thescientists will operate the observatory's three ultraviolettelescopes, while an X-ray telescope will be managed by computercommands from the ground.   Two crew members are payload specialists, non-space-agencyemployees who will help operate the observatory. It is the firsttime since the Challenger accident that payload specialists haveflown aboard a shuttle.</TEXT><HEAD>---</HEAD><TEXT>   At age 59, Brand is the oldest person to fly in space. He saidColumbia probably will be his last flight.   ``I'll probably move on to a management job, a second career ifyou will, at this late day. But, frankly, there isn't anything thatbeats flying in space,'' Brand said in an interview earlier thisyear.   Two other astronauts are older than Brand, but neither has flownfor five or more years.   Brand joined the astronaut corps in 1966 after serving in theMarines as a naval aviator and working as a test pilot for LockheedAircraft Corp.   His three previous trips into space included the historic July1975 Apollo-Soyuz linkup, the first fully operational shuttleflight in November 1982 and the 10th shuttle flight in February1984.   Although some astronauts have left the highflying career toassume management roles in the space agency or pursue otherinterests, Brand has been happy to stay and wait his turn formission assignments.   ``I suppose a lot of people would do this until their 90 yearsold if they could,'' he said.   But he conceded that the problem now is getting back in the longline again.   Brand was born in Longmont, Colo., where he graduated fromLongmont High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in business andin aeronautical engineering from the University of Colorado and amaster's degree in business administration from the University ofCalifornia at Los Angeles.   He is married and has six children.</TEXT><HEAD>---</HEAD><TEXT>   Columbia pilot Guy Gardner, an Air Force colonel, has made oneprevious trip into space aboard a secret military flight inDecember 1988.   The flight, the second shuttle mission after the Challengeraccident, carried an all-military crew. This time, Gardner is thesole active military man among the seven crew members.   During the 10-day mission, Gardner will steer the shuttle whiletwo other astronauts on his shift operate the Astro observatory.The crew is divided into two groups so that work can continuearound the clock.   Gardner, 42, grew up in Alexandria, Va., where he graduated fromGeorge Washington High School. He earned a bachelor's inengineering sciences, astronautics and math from the Air ForceAcademy and a master's in astronautics from Purdue.   He flew 177 combat missions in Southeast Asia in the early 1970sand later attended the Air Force Test Pilot School at Edwards AirForce Base, Calif.   Gardner was selected as an astronaut in May 1980. He is marriedand has three children.   ``I've wanted to be an astronaut since I was a kid because I'vealways been interested in outer space,'' Gardner said.   In elementary school, he read science fiction books and dreamedof exploring the heavens. Astronauts then were test pilots, andthat fact guided him during his military career, he said.   After the Columbia flight, Gardner said, he plans to get back inline for another mission. He hopes to command a flight.</TEXT><HEAD>---</HEAD><TEXT>   Mike Lounge, one of three mission specialists aboard Columbia,has flown in space twice before, including the firstpost-Challenger flight.   Lounge, the crew's flight engineer, will guide the orbiter 12hours daily while two astronomers operate the observatory. He alsois trained to perform an emergency spacewalk if necessary.   Although his pilot duties should keep him busy, Lounge said hehopes to find some time to look out the window.   ``You never get tired of that,'' he said.   Lounge, 44, grew up in Burlington, Colo., and graduated fromBurlington High School. He earned a bachelor's in physics and mathfrom the Naval Academy and a master's in astrogeophysics from theUniversity of Colorado.   He joined the Navy in 1969 and spent the next nine years onvarious assignments.   In 1974, he became a physics instructor at the Naval Academy.Two years later, he transferred to the Navy Space Project office inWashington as a staff project officer.   He resigned his regular Navy commission in 1978 and joined theNaval Air Reserve. He is a lieutenant colonel in the Texas AirNational Guard.   Lounge has three children. His wife, Kathryn, is a payloadintegration manager at the Johnson Space Center.   He began working at the space center in 1978 as an engineer andwas selected as an astronaut two years later.   Lounge first flew into space on a 1985 shuttle flight. Threeyears later, he was a crew member aboard the first shuttle to flyafter the Challenger explosion.</TEXT><HEAD>---</HEAD><TEXT>   Mission specialist Robert Parker, one of four astronomers onboard who will operate the Astro observatory, is making his secondtrip into space. He also flew on the first Spacelab mission in1988.   The 53-year-old astronaut said in an interview earlier this yearthat the most challenging part of the mission will be to get theobservatory working.   ``I'm especially looking forward to the fun of going observing(in space) for a whole week,'' he added.   Parker was born in New York City but grew up in Shrewsbury,Mass. He earned a bachelor's degree in astronomy and physics fromAmherst College and a doctorate in astronomy from the CaliforniaInstitute of Technology.   After being selected as an astronaut in 1967, he served onastronaut ground support crews for the Apollo 15 and 17 missionsand as program scientist for the Skylab program director's office.   For a year beginning in 1988, he was director of the spaceflight-space station integration office at NASA headquarters inWashington.   He and his wife have four children.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
