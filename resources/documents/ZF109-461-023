 And why not, considering the low production costsand high-density storage capabilities.andM;Since its beginnings more than five years ago in the personal-computerindustry, CD-ROM (Compact DiscRead Only Memory) has traditionally been usedas a medium to deliver numerous applications that require large amounts ofdata.andP;  Within the last nine months, some UNIX vendors have moved toincorporate CD-ROM into their mainstream system-software and documentationofferings.andP;  To date, these products have served mainly to replacepreviously-used media for software and documentation distribution.andM;CD-ROM has become an alternate medium to the cartridge.andP;  The production costadvantage of CD-ROM (about $2 each) over cartridge tape (at $15-30 each)becomes overwhelming.andP;  Because of production cost, some vendors see CD-ROMnot merely as an alternate medium, but as the default or preferred medium.andO;As an example, Sun Microsystems announced that in 1991, it plans to convertits distribution media exclusively to compact disc.andM;CD-ROM likewise offers great potential for cost-effective distribution ofdocumentation.andP;  An average manual can cost from $3 to $10 to reproduce.andP;  Whencompared with a CD-ROM, which can easily hold over 200,000 pages of text andtherefore literally hundreds of manuals for only $2, the cost of paperdocumentation is astronomical.andM;When used as a medium to distribute software and information, CD-ROM offersan advantage in cost that's an improvement over magnetic media (measured indollars per MB).andP;  Moreover, CD-ROM opens opportunities for innovations toenhance the delivery of software and information.andP;  We examine the advantagesthat CD-ROM offers to user and vendor alike when applied to software andinformation delivery, then explore the challenges vendors face inimplementing some of these combined technologies.andM;Information Delivery.andP;  Consider the fact that a manual is basically asingle-user device.andP;  It can be very expensive to outfit every user with anindividual copy of documentation.andP;  On the other hand, once the CD-ROM driveis set up as a network resource, many users can share access to an on-lineCD-ROM library.andP;  The critical expense measurement then becomes thedocumentation cost per user.andP;  Amortized over the number of users in a typicalnetworked workgroup, the cost becomes compelling on a per-user basis whencompared with the expense of manuals for each individual.andM;Of course, paper's portability and its usefulness for extended studynecessitates that some paper documentation be maintained.andP;  Also, paperdocumentation is necessary at installation or other times when the system isnot available.andP;  These needs can be met by a central library for theworkgroup.andP;  By combining the best of on-line and text libraries, a group canuse each medium to maximum benefit at minimum cost.andM;An additional advantage of CD-ROM over traditional documentation is the easewith which compact disks can be updated.andP;  With paper, when the updatearrives, one of three situations is likely to occur: hours of tediousinsertion of replacement pages, the old manual is tossed out in the uneasyhope that it was the correct one to discard, or the update sits in anunopened box.andP;  In contrast, CD-ROM discs can be replaced in minutes andarchived easily.andP;  Because CD-ROM is read-only, the information it contains ispermanent-a big advantage for items that you do not want to be changed, suchas documentation archives.andM;Able to store over 600 MB, a typical CD-ROM has capacity for much more thanthe average vendor's set of documentation.andP;  Many types of disparate, usefulinformation can be integrated through a unified retrieval interface.andP;  All thesystem information a user might want can be stored on a single CDROM.andP;  Acomplete library of these types of information can be updated all at once,simply by replacing the latest disc for the old one.andP;  This gives users aneasy way to ensure they are working with the most recent and complete  set ofinformation.andM;Another advantage of CD-ROM is the short duplication time in the productionof CD-ROM platters.andP;  Because CD-ROM production involves a straightforwardmechanical process, discs can be produced quickly in large volumes.andP;  Insteadof weeks to publish several manuals for distribution, CD-ROMs can be pressedin days or even hours.andP;  Turnaround time can even be shortened if a prioritypremium is paid to the pressing facility.andP;  Software vendors can drasticallyreduce the replication time of software and documentation-and their time tomarket.andM;Enabling technologies, such as full-text retrieval and hypertext, createsynergies with CD-ROM-based documentation products.andP;  When combined with thevast amounts of information on a compact disc, these retrieval and navigationmethods offer users faster and easier access to the information they need.andO;User-productivity gains, time saved by searching on-line, have been reported(by at least one vendor's study) to be several hours per month per user.andP;  Nodoubt other UNIX vendors will seek to introduce their own improved on-linedocumentation systems that integrate CD-ROM.andM;Multimedia documents are a natural application area to employ CD-ROMtechnology.andP;  These elements, even with compression, require largedata-storage files.andP;  CD-ROM can deliver these large data files in acost-effective way.andP;  This opportunity will move documentation far beyond whatcan be delivered with traditional methods.andP;  One can imagine documents in thisenvironment being interactive, color, three-dimensional animations with audioannotation to explain the task at hand.andM;The distinction between computer-based tutorials and technical documentationwill blur substantially as such documents are written for this new deliverytechnique.andP;  For workstation vendors, the usability of increasingly complexcomputer systems-including those that offer high-resolution, color, andthree-dimensional display capability as well as fast throughput-can keep pacewith the need to attract new applications and users.andM;Many other vertical-market applications appropriately use CD-ROM to deliverlarge quantities of data.andP;  The proliferation of 2D- and 3D-image librarieswill continue to expand in both the PC and UNIX markets.andP;  As the base ofCD-ROM drives grows on UNIX machines, so does the incentive for morehigh-data-content applications.andM;Software Delivery.andP;  Until recently, software and documentation distributionsfor microcomputers and workstations were limited to magnetic media forsoftware and data and paper for documentation.andP;  Software manufacturers havebeen well served by the steady improvements in capacity, performance, andsupporting peripheral prices of floppy disks and magnetic tape  1/4'cartridge and 1/2' reel).andP;  The leap in capacity of alternative mediaaddresses several trends.andP;  Growing software size and complexity, shorterproduct life cycles, and competitive price pressures are causing softwaremanufacturers to reconsider their historical reliance on magnetic media andto develop new softwareand information-distribution strategies.andP;  Strategiesthat will address the complex requirements of networked computingenvironments and a wide variety of software-licensing options, in addition tosolving the basic requirements for &quot;delivering bits.&quot;andM;Taking advantage of CD-ROM's capacity to store and deli number of softwareproducts at one time can cut media costs further.andP;  CD-ROM's combination ofvast capacity, low cost, and absence of bulk enables software manufacturers,for the first time, to send out multiple software products, demonstrations,audio, and written documentation for $2 to $3, little more than the cost of adirect mailing.andM;Coupled with the appropriate security or licensing software, companies willbe able to distribute large numbers of their products in advance.andP;  Whenneeded, these can be activated via an electronic connection or passwordentry.andP;  Delivery of software products on CD-ROM will become nearlyinstantaneous by separating in time the software delivery from physical mediashipment.andP;  The challenge for software vendors is to provide this improvedlevel of service without incurring significant administrative overhead orcreating inconveniences for customers.andP;  Simultaneously, vendors will have toimplement adequate security measures to protect their investment in softwaredevelopment from piracy.andM;One approach to software-access protection is to encrypt the contents, or aportion of the contents, of the CD-ROM.andP;  With encryption, using CD-ROM mediainstead of magnetic media is straightforward and requires no changes tosoftware products.andP;  After entering a password or keyword provided by thesoftware vendor, customers install software from the CD-ROM using existingtools.andP;  In effect, the CD-ROM replaces a box full of floppy disks or magnetictapes.andP;  Note, however, that CD-ROM with install-time protection offers noadditional security than the current magnetic media distribution.andM;Vendors that have implemented this approach have experienced several majorproblems not encountered with single-product distributions.andP;  With manyproducts per distribution, there is an increased incentive for users todefeat the protection scheme.andP;  The availability of more powerful computersalso makes it feasible for relatively unsophisticated users armed withbrute-force methods to obtain valid keywords.andM;To defeat these attempts, vendors would have to increase the length ofsoftware  keys&quot; and extend decryption time.andP;  For reasonable security,keywords would have to be several hundred bytes in length, eliminating anyprospect of communicating keywords by voice or entering them by h alternativeof keywords, disseminated electronically or via paper certificates,facsimile, or other means defeats the initial motivation for distributingmultiple products on a single medium, and excludes those customers withoutthe proper hardware, such as a modem, or access to phone, fax, or networkconnections.andP;  Even if these technical challenges could be met, softwarevendors' investments in encryption technology would add little additionalvalue and could be thwarted by the illicit dissemination and publication ofkeywords by customers.andM;Another approach to software-access protection involves restricting theexecution of a program to an individual CPU or system.andP;  This method is knownas keylocking or nodelocking.andP;  With nodelocking, users receive keys forprograms or program features which enable execution of the application on asingle system.andP;  Typically, the nodelocking algorithm checks for a unique CPUor controller identifier to grant execution privileges.andM;From the vendor's point of view, nodelocking has the benefit of greatlyreducing the incidence of unauthorized  duplication  and eliminates thesecurity problems of having a single keyword that works for all users.andP;  Fromthe customer's standpoint, however, nodelocking is a step backwards insoftware licensing.andM;The price the customer pays for quick software delivery is offset by theextra hassle encountered when hardware used by the nodelocking algorithm isserviced or replaced, or when a system is sold or moved to anotherdepartment.andP;  Responsive software vendors would have to provide 24-hourkeyword administration services and have adequate database support toefficiently broker keyword changes and transfers.andP;  Even with theseadministrative processes in place, the customer would experience delayswhenever an application needed to be transferred to another user and, in allcases, would have to contact the software vendor for a new keyword.andP;  Bothcustomers and vendors need tools more flexible than nodelocking andencryption to manage CD-ROM software-access protection.andM;Licensing Plans.andP;  Network-based licensing  systems, such as Hewlett-Packard'sNetwork License Manager, Sun Microsystems' SunNet License, and HighlandSoftware's FlexLM, provide the necessary installation and runtime protectionneeded to distribute multiple software products on a single medium whileaddingandM;additional  value  in networked environments.andP;  Network-license managers usenetwork services to reach a license server in order to determine whichapplications, features, and what number of licenses are available to users ona computer network.andP;  Licenses can either float among all users on a networkor can be restricted by and/or to a department, group, or single user.andO;Potentially, licenses can even be shared by systems from different hardwarevendors.andP;  Licenses and features are made available by entering keywords intothe server's database.andM;The Sun, HP, and Highland license-management products all include keywordadministration tools for software vendors to generate keywords and maintainrecords of keyword transactions.andP;  All three products can generatelicense-usage reports which are helpful when evaluating additional licensepurchases.andP;  The Sun and HP products include graphical administration toolssuitable for end-user use.andP;  These tools employ the Open Look and Motiflook-and-feel.andM;The three products use different network services for communication betweenthe application and server.andP;  FlexLM libraries utilize TCP/IP as thecommunication protocol.andP;  Network License Manager uses the Network ComputingService (NCS), recently adopted by X/Open for its Distributed ComputingEnvironment (DCE) standard for application-server communications.andP;  SunNetLicense employs the Open Network Computing (ONC) Remote Procedure Call (RPC)facility for license-server control.andP;  The choice of a network-license servercould restrict the types of systems available to a software vendor, and is animportant factor in a network-license vendor selection.andM;Network-license management technology, coupled with multiple software-productdistribution on CD-ROM, provides several unique benefits  oversingle-software-product distribution on magnetic media.andP;  Sincelicense-management products can control both the duration of operation andthe available features for a software product, software vendors can shipdemonstration software to a hardware vendor's entire installed base forvirtually pennies per copy.andP;  This is particularly feasible for workstationvendors who send regular software updates to a significant percentage oftheir customers (like those on maintenance contracts).andM;Customers benefit from being able to review software products beforepurchase, while software vendors benefit from the increased applicationexposure, from combining promotional and software-distribution expenses, andfrom nearly eliminating any incremental cost of sales.andP;  To demonstratecomplex applications requiring hands-on assistance, sales representatives canarrive at the customer site with a limited-duration license key todemonstrate the latest software product.andP;  The economy of CDROM also makes itpossible to distribute automated (and animated) demonstrations for productsthat are sold through dealer channels.andP;  For new companies, this is aparticularly  efficient  way  to achieve increased exposure at low cost.andP;  Forcomputer user groups, CD-ROM is a cost-effective way to distributecollections of utilities and applications contributed by group members.andM;Companies such as Highland Software believe that the advantages ofthird-party software distribution are numerous enough to make it a business.andO;The company is in the process of enlisting software vendors to buy space onHighland's CD-ROM distribution to workstation users with CD-ROM drives.andP;  Thesuccess of such a program, and the ultimate success of CD-ROM distributionprograms in general, will depend on the speed at and degree to which vendorsand end-users embrace CD-ROM as a primary distribution medium.andM;Vendors of workstations and servers have the greatest need to adopt CD-ROMbecause of frequent hardware advances (often requiring new software support),the size and complexity of software products and documentation, and thegrowing volume of data required by applications.andP;  Future applications thatincorporate audio and video information will accentuate this requirement.andO;The increasingly urgent need for more efficient information distribution isthe driving force that will cause workstation vendors to be the first toadopt CD-ROM aggressively as their primary distribution medium.andP;  Theirsuccess in moving to a cost-effective, high-capacity medium will make itpossible for other vendors to support CD-ROM technology in the future.andM;Several key factors will contribute to the successful transition to CD-ROM byworkstation vendors.andP;  As previously noted, workstation system-softwaredistribution, documentation, and product enhancements are generally bulky andsubject to regular updates, posing some inconvenience to both manufacturerand customer.andP;  Because most workstation customers are connected to a network,and one drive can thus serve several users, the initial investment requiredto provide access to a CD-ROM drive is shared.andM;In addition, the price of a CD-ROM drive is reasonable in comparison to thetotal cost of a workstation configuration, and is low enough that workstationvendors can recognize a short-term benefit by defraying some of the user'scost to move to CD-ROM.andP;  Sun has announced a promotional bundle that includesits system software with CD-ROM drive purchases for a limited time toencourage purchasers of new systems to acquire the drives.andP;  Lower servicepricing, along with loans or subsidies for CD-ROM drives, are alsofinancially feasible given the moderate cost of the drives.andM;Compact-disc technology, along with network-license management andhypertext-retrieval technologies, will advance the usefulness of workstationsand microcomputers.andP;  CD-ROM, along with attendant network-licensingtechnology, will enable virtually instant delivery of software products anddocumentation, while making it possible for users to evaluate software beforepurchase with little additional cost to the software vendor.andM;By virtue of CD-ROM's low cost, distribution of information and data can befrequent and comprehensive, and CD-ROM's capacity is high enough to satisfythe needs of the growing number of data-hungry programs.andP;  Best of all, theeconomics of CD-ROM distribution is becoming more favorable for both thecustomer and the vendor; it is this development, more than any other, thatwill ultimately determine CD-ROM's success as the next distribution medium ofchoice.andM;Ken Kershner is a program manager for information delivery at SiliconGraphics Inc., and co-manages the company's CD-ROM program.andP;  Prior to joiningSGI, he was a product manager at Hewlett-Packard.andP;  Kershner received an MBAfrom the Sloan School of Management at MIT and a BSEE from Duke University.andM;Ben Passarelli is a program manager for software delivery and co-manager ofthe CD-ROM program at SGI.andP;  Previously he was a systems-software programmanager at Sun Microsystems.andP;  Passarelli holds biology and psychology degreesfrom Stanford University.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
