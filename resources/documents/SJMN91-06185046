Color sparkles from the end of a hand-held wand. Ahigh-pitched howl screams out of another. And a third pops like a cap gun.;   But there's not a match in sight. Erle isn't selling fireworks. He's peddlingnon-pyrotechnic Fourth of July toys called FunnerWorks.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HOLIDAY SAFETY IN SIGHTALTERNATIVES TOY WITH IDEA OF FIREWORKS  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     &quot;We're so much more comfortable having them placed into the hands of smallchildren,&quot; said Sandy Simpson, spokeswoman for state Fire Marshal James F.McMullen.;    FunnerWorks is the brainchild of Natalie Joy Siman, 34, whostarted the Ventura-based company in 1988 after she and some friends decidedfireworks, banned in much of the state, gave children mixed messages. &quot;We tellkids that firemen and police are our friends, yet every Fourth of July we hidefrom them.&quot;;    The toys work on light or other principles of physics tosimulate fireworks. The sparkle fountain, for example, replaces sparklers witha flashlight and fiber optics. The Kracker Blaster pops pieces of newspaperinserted between a tube and a rubber bulb.;    Most are reusable, Siman said.;   She donates some profits to foundations to help burn victims, as do mostfund-raising groups that sell FunnerWorks, she said.;    Sales areskyrocketing, Siman said. About 16,000 families bought FunnerWorks in 1988.This year about 40,000 families had ordered them by Tuesday.;    Even aspokesman for Freedom Fireworks, which manufactures so-called &quot;safe and sane&quot;fireworks, had something good to say about FunnerWorks. Though he saidcelebrating Independence Day with anything other than pyrotechnic devices isinconsistent with the perception of the holiday, Freedom's Dennis Revellcalled them a noble effort for donating money to help burn victims.;    Somepeople, however, aren't buying into the idea at all.;    &quot;It doesn't seemtraditional,&quot; said Steve Schatz, 18, of Dublin, who said he has been playingwith fireworks since he was 10. &quot;Reusable? That doesn't seem too fun.&quot;;     IFYOU'RE INTERESTED; FunnerWorks can be ordered by calling the following phonenumbers: in Dublin, (415) 829-4106; in San Jose, (408) 292-8211; in Cupertino,(408) 723-3126; in Hayward, (415) 471-0444; in Castro Valley: (415) 670-5880.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  TUNG YIN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Alameda County/AM  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910703  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  432  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday July 3, 199100185046,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
