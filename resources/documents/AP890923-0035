Hugo blasted the eastern Caribbean and the Carolinas with 135 mphwinds this past week, killing at least 41 people.   Just before Hugo struck the U.S. coast, its pressure was measuredat 940 millibars. That made it among the 12 strongest hurricanesthis century to hit the United States, the National HurricaneCenter's Miles Lawrence said today.   Gilbert, whose winds reached 180 mph, tore up the Caribbean lastyear, killing 300 and causing $2 billion damage. It was the mostpowerful hurricane ever recorded.   Gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane withcurrent ocean temperatures, said Kerry Emanuel of the meteorologydepartment at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.   But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, ``thewind speeds might be 25 percent higher _ which means the destructiveforce would be more like 50 percent higher,'' he said.   Stephen Schneider, deputy director of the National Center forAtmospheric Research in Denver, said his research suggests thewarming trend is already here.   Schneider, an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a newbook ``Global Warming,'' said six of the 10 hottest years in thelast 100 occurred in the 1980s.   He projects that the 1990s will be even hotter.   Hugo demonstrated the effect of warm Atlantic waters when itswinds jumped from 105 mph to 135 mph as it passed over the GulfStream before hitting the East Coast, Schneider said.   ``You'll get worse hurricanes if the Caribbean is warmer,'' hesaid. ``And I think there are better-than-even odds that you willhave stronger hurricanes.''   Emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs, moderate hurricanesof the future could grow to Gilbert's strength _ and future Gilbertswill be even stronger.   Gilbert was so strong that Bob Sheets, director of the nationalhurricane center, said forecasters may have to use an intensityscale of 1-6 in the future, instead of the current 1-5, with fivethe highest.   The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-casescenario, over the next 100 years the world's temperature could jumpby 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which bothcontribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into theatmosphere unchecked.   It is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up,the Caribbean could somehow remain cooler. But he said that isunlikley.   ``That's not what the models are showing,'' Schneider said. ``Andthat's another reason I'd like to slow down global warming.''</TEXT></DOC>
