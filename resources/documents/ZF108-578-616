the ACLU, in the context of caller-identificationtelephones.andP;  He objects to &quot;concern about the rights of criminals and fringegroups.&quot;andM;I remind Mr. Lustig that in America &quot;criminals&quot; are defined by law, not byvitriolic accusation, and that no one is required to belong to his tribe, beit fringe or mainstream.andP;  Rights are set by law, not opinion.andP;  The ACLUprotects me from you, Mr. Lustig.andM;Bill AdamsandM;IS DirectorandM;The Casey Family ProgramandM;SeattleandM;DOES CRIME PAY?andM;To the Editor:andM;In the June 4 issue, Mr. David Smith suggested that hacker Robert Morrisshould be rewarded for his dastardly deeds with a 20-year career with theFBI, the CIA or the NSA (at the taxpayers' expense, of course).andM;When I'm putting in my application for that next really big job opening, I'llbe sure to include on my resume all my hack jobs, criminal sabotages, andmalicious experiments on other people's computer systems.andP;  I'm sure they willbe impressed.andM;Richard HartmanandM;Philip MorrisandM;Williamsburg, Va.andM;NO-NONSENSE NETWORKSandM;To the Editor:andM;&quot;So what if 6,000 people came 'grinding to a halt' on a network&quot;?andP;  DavidSmith, in his response to Jim Seymour's column criticizing the sentence ofRobert Morris, may consider a computer a giant toy, but he surely can'tbelieve that everyone who works on one has, or should have, such an attitude.andM;Especially dangerous is the person who considers a network his personalplayground.andP;  A network such as Internet does not exist to support pranksterswho have nothing better to do with their time than coddle their egos bydevising ingenious ways to interfere with others' work, but rather tofacilitate the work of those who take their time and occupations seriously.andO;When someone betrays the trust that such a network assumes, who can helplosing confidence in the ability of the network to do what it is intended todo?andM;Would Mr. Smith have been so flippant if a project on which his job dependedhad been interrupted for several days due to the vandalism of a boredstudent?andM;Jeremy WarachandM;Programmer/AnalystandM;Midland Montagu USAandM;New YorkandM;CRIME AND PUNISHMENTandM;To the Editor:andM;The responses to Jim Seymour's column about Morris' conviction are a perfectexample of the real problem.andP;  Until the computing community realizes thatcomputer systems are not giant toys and view hacks as criminal acts, we willcontinue to see a growing occurrence of this type of problem.andM;I work for a company that finds itself a major target of people &quot;playing withcomputers.&quot; A large number of people spend a lot of time and money to preventor recover from these games.andP;  Computers are more than toys.andP;  Serious problemscan result when they are tampered with, ranging from lack of telephoneservice (if it is a network system) to death (if it is a hospital controlssystem).andM;Morris got off too lightly.andP;  I think he should have been given a jailsentence.andP;  I also think that this jail sentence should have been suspended,due to the fact that he had not intended the outcome of his worm and did tryto help resolve its aftermath.andP;  Someone who is convicted of manslaughter doesnot get as serious a sentence as someone who commits first-degree murder.andP;  Hedoes, however, get a sentence and not an &quot;Oh my, you shouldn't have donethat&quot; from the courts.andM;Some may think that equating hacking to murder is a little overdramatic.andO;That depends on your point of view.andP;  I'm the one who has to &quot;revive&quot; thedead.andM;Kat LakeyandM;Ameritech Applied TechnologiesandM;IndianapolisandM;BRAIN TRUSTandM;To the Editor:andM;Jim Seymour's June 4 column suggesting that PC users are more structured andlogical than Mac users got it half right.andM;The human brain is divided into two hemispheres: The left is for logic, theright for creativity.andM;DOS is a left-brained operating system.andP;  It takes logic to construct a DOScommand with pipes and parameters; the creativity quotient is zero.andP;  DOSmachines, therefore, appeal to people who are highly structured and logical.andM;Mac OS is right-brained.andP;  Most operations are intuitive, and the desktop canbe set up in harmony with the user's aesthetic sense.andP;  Macs, therefore,appeal to creative users.andM;Logic and creativity are both valued in a business environment.andP;  At themargin, DOS users may be more logical, Mac people more creative.andM;Marty BarrackandM;Burke, Va.andM;CAUSE AND EFFECTandM;To the Editor:andM;Jim Seymour probably wrote his column of June 4 on a Mac.andP;  The obviousquestion does not seem to have been asked by Mr. Seymour: Does our thinkinginfluence the type of computer that we use?andP;  A computer is nothing more thana tool.andP;  Different people choose different tools for the same job.andP;  Assumingthat the tool has had an effect upon the user because of a difference in thefinal outcome is ridiculous.andP;  Suppose an abnormally large percentage of mailsent to Santa Claus is addressed in crayon.andP;  Should we assume that the use ofa crayon encourages a belief in mythical characters?andM;It is not unreasonable that people who are more concerned with appearancewould select a computer that has a GUI and makes it easy to generatesharp-looking documents.andP;  Those who are more rigorous in their approach willbe less daunted by the more complex DOS interface and will be attracted tothe wider selection of software tools available to the DOS user.andP;  Ittherefore would not be surprising that the products from these two machineswould differ.andM;There may well be reasons why one computer or software package wouldencourage better work than another, but before speculating as to why thismight be, we should first verify that it is so.andM;Mark SauerwaldandM;San DiegoandM;THE HUMAN FACTORandM;To the Editor:andM;Permit a bit of esoteric nit-picking with &quot;Firms Trip over the Human Factorin 'Quantum Leap' to 3-D CAD&quot; (May 28).andP;  Rather than &quot;3-D CAD,&quot; I suggest theauthor means Geometric Computer Modeling.andP;  A plain vanilla,orthodirectional-orthographic, traditional multiview drawing (whether onpaper or on a computer screen) is also 3-D because other views (auxiliaryviews) may be obtained as seen from any direction of space.andP;  This is the testfor spatial three-dimensionality.andM;Also, with regard to the statement &quot;the software didn't let designers includedetailed assembly or manufacturing data,&quot; I suggest the author might revisitcurrent versions of CADKey, Computervision, Silverscreen and so on.andM;R.P.andP;  KelsoandM;Ruston, La.andM;SIN OF OMISSIONandM;To the Editor:andM;In your Poll of Corporate Satisfaction on accounting software in the May 28thissue, you missed the boat.andM;By excluding Solomon III and Libra as well as other packages such as GreatPlains, you did not provide a fair overview of the accounting-softwaremarketplace.andP;  It is unfair to exclude a package based on the length of timethat it has been on the market.andP;  Based on your reasoning, Windows 3.0 shouldnot yet have been reviewed because it has just appeared on the market.andM;David GoldesandM;Vice PresidentandM;The Basex Group Inc.andM;New York</TEXT></DOC>
