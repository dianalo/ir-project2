A statue of a Soviet soldier, posing on a 30-foot column, was erected so Austrians would never forget their rough liberators. But after the Soviet withdrawal, Austria installed a fountain in front of the monument. The fountain's spray sometimes rises so high, Austrians note slyly, that seen from far away, water eclipses the Russians' memorial.    Nowadays the Soviet Union is being obscured on another front in Austria -- international trade. The new Grand Coalition between the nation's two big parties has recently launched an aggressive campaign to gain closer relations with the Common Market. The move comes after a decline in the share of Austrian exports going to the East Bloc: Last year the nation's exports to the East Bloc dropped below 10% for the first time since 1955. Austrians aren't about to stop trading with the East Bloc, or to cut off relations with the East-Bloc trading organization, Comecon. But businessmen, economists and politicians here say that, more than ever, Austria is looking West for its economic future.    At a time when Mikhail Gorbachev's political and economic initiatives are drawing attention -- if not unqualified enthusiasm -- from Western Europe, the U.S. and Asia, neutral Austria's Westward shift stands out. The Central European country's new focus is also a sign of confidence as the number of years since the Allied departure grows. As part of the deal under which the Four Powers withdrew, Austria made extensive reparations to the Soviet Union. The current trade with the West can in some senses be viewed as the Austrians' signal that they've finished payments on their war debt.    &quot;In the area of foreign trade and international investment,&quot; Austria's chancellor, Franz Vranitzky, says in an interview, &quot;there are compelling reasons for us to get closer to the Common Market.&quot; And Hannes Androsch, who heads Creditanstalt Bankverein, Austria's largest bank, says: &quot;If we don't get closer relations with the Common Market, we will be Albanianized.&quot;    Austria has been slowly winding down trade with the East Bloc for years. Last year, Austrian exports to the East Bloc dropped 15.6% from the 1985 level. Trade with the Soviet Union and its East Bloc Comecon partners accounted for some 9.6% of all Austrian exports, down from 15.1% in 1976. Imports from the East Bloc dropped to 8.3% of all Austria's imports, down from around 10% in the mid-1970s. Trade with the Common Market, by contrast, grew: Exports to the EC countries rose to 60.1% of all Austrian exports, from 48.8% in 1976.    The sharp 1986 drop in Eastward exports is in part attributable to the low price of oil, the Soviet Union's big export. But Austrians also have frank reservations about Mr. Gorbachev's future projects. &quot;In the Soviet Union and much of the East Bloc, joint ventures are white elephants,&quot; says Jan Stankovsky, who watches East European economies from the Austrian Institute for Economic Research.    Austrian banks, to which more than 10% of the East Bloc's debt to Western creditors is owed, are similarly cautious. &quot;Banks have reached a limit as far as exposure is concerned,&quot; says F. Zahir, a senior lending officer in the international operations of Girozentrale, a large investment bank. The Soviets, a banker noted, are seeing now that &quot;their economy can't afford their ideology.&quot;    Austria's foreign minister, Alois Mock, recently made his country's position clear: &quot;We belong to the community of free countries in Europe and have nothing in common with the communist countries.&quot; Even Austrian neutrality, which long kept Austria out of the Western trade bloc, is today viewed as less of an obstacle. &quot;There's already a neutral member of the EC: Ireland,&quot; points out Mr. Androsch of Creditanstalt.    A fairly frantic campaign by the government to work toward a closer relationship with the Common Market backs up the leaders' words. Bankers, economists and politicians talk about the danger of falling off the economic edge of Europe -- if Austria can't tighten economic ties to Western Europe. Trips to Brussels and large-scale politicking in the direction of the Common Market currently taking place contrast with Austria's rather restrained posture during the government of Bruno Kreisky in the 1970s. Austria's slowing economic growth -- the nation now expects 1% growth or lower this year, down from the 2% predicted for 1987 in last fall's election campaign -- is making the country nervous.    The main debate here is what kind of closer relationship with the Common Market Austria wants. The government currently advocates working for closer ties with the Common Market both multilaterally, through the European Free Trade Association, and bilaterally, in direct relations with the Common Market. But it stops short at calling for full membership. Others say autonomous action by Austria would suffice, if Austria managed to rearrange all its industrialist standards so they conformed to the Common Market's.    All of those talking about the Common Market here, though, fear the same thing: the year 1992. That's when, under a white paper produced by the European Commission last year, the Common Market is set to become one large market with no internal frontiers. &quot;The removal of the interior barriers between Common Market members is the de facto creation of a new, external barrier around the Common Market,&quot; says Mr. Stankovsky of the research institute.    Some say that Austria exaggerates its need to move West out of a simple fear of being left out. The country already can boast a multiplicity of bilateral and multilateral links to the Common Market. In 1972, Austria signed a bilateral agreement to create a free-trade zone with the Common Market, ending customs on all items crossing the EC-Austrian borders except agriculture products. It also derives trade advantages from its membership in the European Free Trade Association.    There are also Austrian lobbies that oppose a Common Market approach, including ecology-minded Greens who charge the Common Market environment standards are below Austria's, and farmers who are afraid their high subsidies would be cut if Austria joined the trade bloc.    No one predicts trade with the East Bloc will ever disappear from Austria's export roster. One reason is that Austria's nationalized industries, legendary resisters of change, are some of the largest East-Bloc suppliers. The Austrian steel industry, largely nationalized, delivers some 19.8% of its product to East European countries.    And, diplomats as always, Austrians are careful to play down any shift in their delicate East-West balance. &quot;Trade relations with the East have been established for a long time,&quot; said Chancellor Vranitzky. &quot;Looking to the West doesn't mean we will neglect our Eastern partners.&quot;    ---   Miss Shlaes is editorial-features editor of The Wall Street Journal/Europe. </TEXT></DOC>
