Authorities have issued masks to residents who are remaining inthe area to protect them from a thick cloud of ash spewed by thevolcano over a sparsely populated area of about 12 square miles.   And scientists estimate that 525 million cubic feet of lava haveoozed out of the 8,400-foot volcano, toward an uninhabited valley,since the eruption began.   Lonquimay, a peak in the Andes foothills about 400 miles south ofSantiago, had been dormant for a century when it erupted onChristmas Day.   Authorities say the eruption poses no danger for two nearbyvillages, Lolco and Malacahuello. Residents of both towns quicklyevacuated after the eruption, and some later returned home. But manyremain lodged at schools and municipal buildings in Curacautin, acity 50 miles away.   Authorities on Saturday issued masks to the few residents who hadreturned to their homes. Researchers, soldiers and police officersalso in the area were also wearing the white masks.   On Sunday, the volcano continued to spew smoke and lava through a300-foot-wide crater. The volcano initially showed three separatesmaller fissures, but a series of explosions joined them into asingle crater, authorities said.   Seismologists from the University of La Frontera, in Temuco, thelargest city in the region, said a 1,200-foot-wide, 30-foot-highmass of lava is slowly slipping down the volcano.   They said the route followed by the lava is the same as the onein the Lonquimay's previous eruption, in 1889, and poses no dangerfor the population. Livestock in the area were removed to saferzones, police said.</TEXT></DOC>
