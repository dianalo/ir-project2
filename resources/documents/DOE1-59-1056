In the Soviet view, though Americandeclaratory statements ostensibly committed US policy to concepts ofnuclear sufficiency, in the real world-in the world of military procurement-theAmerican build-up belied the notion of 'sufficiency' and American capabilitieswere being developed beyond those which could be identified with 'deterrencethrough punishment.' It was impossible, therefore, for the Soviet Unionto subscribe to the mutality of 'assured destruction' when military realityappeared to suggest further expansion of US counterforce capability:it was no part of Soviet policy to increase Soviet vulnerability norto pinion the Soviet Union in a 'hostage' concept. As for mutal deterrence,it had to be a mutality stripped of American attempts at coercion (compellance)and without resort to the reimposition of `unilateral deterrence'. Yetanother contradiction was that certain American attitudes professed war-avoidanceand the 'unthinkability' of nuclear war, while the Soviet Union determinedon war-prevention coupled with the acceptance of the possibility of nuclearwar, an admixture which produced no small degree of confusion, acrimonyand accusation in Western circles, certain of which insisted on the implacabilityof Soviet intentions in a quest for unchallenged military superiority-thusdemolishing deterrence and undermining any mutuality.</TEXT></DOC>
