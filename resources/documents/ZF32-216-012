PrestonandM;Ridgefield, ConnecticutandM;MEMO TO WILLandM;Would someone please tell Will Zachmann to stop trying to sell us so hard onOS/2? Gee !andP;  Joe GreeneandM;Indianapolis, IndianaandM;MORE TO SAY ABOUT GATEWAYandM;Gateway 2000's pricing policy is strange indeed (Letters, November 27, 1990).andO;But so is its advertising.andP;  Biweekly, Gateway inserts five thick, glossysheets of noninformative material in your magazine.andP;  I would estimate thatwithin the last two months alone, Gateway must have used about 100 tons (yes,tons) of heavyweight, high-quality paper this way.andM;Like others, I read your magazine partly for its advertising.andP;  But bydisplaying such wasteful disregard for our natural resources, Gateway lost meas a potential customer quite a long time ago.andM;W.andP;  Peter JanickiandM;Bethesda, MarylandandM;I think you gave Gateway 2000 a bum rap in the November 27 Letters column.andO;If you read Lance Simmons' letter, and then read Todd Osborne's reply, youget two different versions of the story.andP;  Lance says &quot;the price given in thereview was lowered just so the system could appear in the article,&quot; whileTodd says &quot;The $1,850 system was configured to PC Magazine's reviewparameters.&quot;andM;These tell the same story but imply vastly different things.andP;  Your emphasisof the &quot;dung from the cows&quot; statement in the column's call-out box leaves thecasual observer with the impression that Gateway 2000 is a bunch of stinkers(no pun intended).andM;Whatever happened is not the issue.andP;  I and several of my associates ownGateway machines, and I have bought more than 20 Gateway machines for my office.andP;  I find that Gateway provides the best equipment at the lowest price,and the service has been excellent.andM;Chuck MinnichandM;Albany, GeorgiaandM;It was with concern that I read about the problems your other readers hadwith Gateway 2000 (Letters, November 27, 1990).andP;  This was not my experiencewith Gateway.andM;I ordered a system from the company and have been satisfied with the leveland quality of service I have received both from Gateway's sales departmentand from the tech department.andP;  I can only assume that your other readersmight have dealt either with a new salesperson or one not as helpful andknowledgeable as the one who dealt with me.andM;It sounds like Gateway needs to train its salespeople to handle calls fromprospective customers more effectively.andM;Stephen P. HavasyandM;Port Washington, New YorkandM;WINDOWS: AandM;SHORT-TERM SOLUTIONandM;Charles Petzold's &quot;Computing in the 1990s: Why Windows 3.0 Is Only aShort-term Solution&quot; (Environments, November 27, 1990) should be requiredreading for every PC manager who is swallowing Microsoft'smultimillion-dollar hype about Windows 3.O.andM;While he mentioned that all calls to DOS involve switching from protected toreal mode and back, he noted only that this has system-stabilityimplications.andP;  He could also have noted that it has horrendous performanceimplications.andP;  My tests indicate that a heavily I/O-bound program runs atroughly one-fourth the speed in Windows standard mode (versus real mode).andO;The trade press seems bent on defining performance as screen-switching speed.andO;Rating Windows 3.0's performance on this basis alone is tantamount to fraud.andM;Given more space, I'm certain Mr. Petzold would have covered other problemsthat are encountered when an attempt is made to superimpose a multitasking,protected-mode, graphics environment on top of a single-tasking, real-mode,outdated operating system.andP;  Had he done so, you might have titled the article&quot;Why Windows Is No Solution.&quot;andM;Wayne JohnsonandM;Becker, MinnesotaandM;STREET PRICE APOLOGYandM;I read with some amusement John Dvorak's comments regarding &quot;Street PriceApology&quot; (Inside Track, November 13, 1990).andP;  Unfortunately, PC Magazine isone of the worst promoters of this mentality (where a company creates anunrealistically high list price on a product that is then discounted on thestreet so that consumers think they're getting a real bargain).andM;In the same issue, you publish what you have decided should be the &quot;streetprice&quot; on laser printers.andP;  This can only add to the problems faced byretailers and VARs who try to provide a value to their customers.andM;Put the shoe on the other foot, PC Magazine.andP;  Great publication: List price$2.95, should sell on the street for about a buck and a half !andP;  Thomas J.andO;PlunkettandM;Redmond, WashingtonandM;UPGRADING YOUR 286andM;In regard to your reply to Mr. Truluck (Letters, November 13, 1990)concerning upgrading his 286, 1 must disagree.andP;  I am an experienced computerhobbyist who has assembled and upgraded many systems for myself, forbusinesses, and for friends.andP;  In my opinion, accelerator boards areoverpriced, mediocre in performance, and waste a valuable bus slot.andM;Why pay $300 to $400 for a questionable improvement when a high-quality 386SXmain board can be had for as much or less? The memory must be upgraded aswell, but most 286 owners only have 1 MB anyway.andP;  At $50 per megabyte, thisis the best time in the history of PCs to buy memory.andM;Owners of 286s who are stuck with an extra memory card can easily use it as aRAM disk in their new 386.andP;  Some accelerator boards require an expensiveextra daughtercard for fast memory anyway.andP;  In certain cases you can actuallysave money by replacing the systemboard.andM;Clever as some accelerator board designs may be, I would never recommend oneto a client or friend.andP;  It's just a matter of choosing efficient andappropriate technology and keeping a clear conscience.andM;Bill CopenhavenandM;Richmond, CaliforniaandM;THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKENandM;Thanks for another great printer issue (November 13, 1990).andP;  And thanks formaking this issue less difficult to lose by providing the easy-to-locate rosebouquet tracking scent.andM;Bruce VieserandM;Knoxville, Tennessee How do I go about getting unscented issues of PCMagazine?andP;  I'm referring to the December 11, 1990 issue which contained somekind of ad with pictures of a rose and an accompanying scent.andP;  I can't tellyou who placed the ad, because I was busy tossing the ripped out pages in thetrash and running for my allergy pills.andM;PC Magazine is a great source of information.andP;  Can't we get the informationwithout the perfumes? I thought blow-in cards were a pain.andP;  They pale bycomparison.andM;Richard DoigandM;Orion, MichiganandM;We received a flood of letters aboutandM;that ad, and it has been pulledandM;from our magazine.andP;  Thanks go to all of you who made your opinions known tous.-Ed.andM;WINDOWS UTILITIESandM;Regarding Barry Simon's First Look at &quot;Aporia's Object-Oriented Desktop&quot;(First Looks, November 27, 1990):The implication of Simon's evaluation isthat Aporia is just a little bit strange, which it is.andP;  And then heconcludes, &quot;It's the most intriguing, innovative, exciting, and promisingWindows shell I've seen.&quot;andM;Simon must lead a sheltered life.andP;  He should see everyone should see-CommandPost, Version 70J, by Wilson WindowWare.andP;  You gave Command Post a brief nodin June, I believe, after the release of Windows 3.0.andP;  it was in transitionthen and deserves a closer look now.andP;  Those who look will be impressed.andM;Robert W. EdkinandM;New York, New YorkandM;What a coincidence.andP;  This issue we took a comprehensive look at bothprograms, as well as other Windows utilities.-Ed.andM;LET THE END USERS WAITandM;Many times you cover software usage issues: copy protection, legal usage, andso on.andP;  Here's an issue rarely mentioned: When an upgrade is announced for anew release, many advertising dollars are spent by the manufacturer both toannounce the new version and to generate new sales.andP;  This is as it should be,but shipping the upgrade for current users is often held until last.andP;  Thecompany's first objective is always to get the product on the shelves tocover the business user base-where the money is.andM;Currently, I have been waiting almost two months for an upgrade to a majorgraphics program.andP;  Although I have been placed in the &quot;Rush&quot; arena (after twocalls), I am told it will still be about three more weeks before shipment, asthe company is under contract to a distributor who must come first.andP;  I havealso experienced similar delays for other upgrades.andM;I believe it's time for the software industry to take care of its current endusers first, not rely on new sales it may or may not generate fromadvertising dollars.andM;Gary P. YounkinsandM;Albuquerque, New MexicoandM;FAX LINE MANAGERSandM;In your article &quot;Fax Line Managers: The Electronic Call Director,&quot; (December11, 1990), two primary solutions for voice/ data switching were discussed(answering on the first ring and waiting until the call is answered).andP;  Bothsolutions are very important, depending on whether the switch is installed ina home or office.andP;  I had hoped the article would have emphasized thatTechnology Concept's Fax Line Manager is the only product.andP;  reviewed that hasboth modems in one switch.andP;  The benefit of this integration is that a singleproduct can be easily installed in a home or small business.andM;Modem usage is important to your readers, as well.andP;  Technology Concept's FaxLine Manager 2O2 has the Data Detect option for fax and modem sharing.andP;  Thisfeature allows a fax and a modem to coexist on a single phone line withoutany manual caller intervention.andM;Jim SturtevantandM;President, Technology ConceptsandM;Foster City, CaliforniaandM;COPY PROTECTION WOESandM;John Dvorak is right to be outraged at Lotus Development's protectionistmoves (November 13,1990).andP;  But the days of programmers turning out code forthe public good are long gone.andP;  Software is a multibillion dollar industry,and it is no surprise that it is dominated by marketing-oriented companiesthat would be just as happy selling soap powder as they are selling programs.andO;In such a world, Lotus's actions are, sadly, logical.andM;It's a tragedy that these corporations have forgotten their roots.andP;  Okay, sonobody expects altruism from IBM, but can Bill Gates, for example, really beproud of the way Microsoft has turned out? Sure, it makes vast profits, butat the expense of an alienated user base locked into underdeveloped productswith worthless support (at least here in Britain).andP;  It almost makes younostalgic for CP/M.andM;Nigel ThomasandM;London, England</TEXT></DOC>
