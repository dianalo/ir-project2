 Medical-instrumentation makers worry about them more than everthese days.andP;  They have to.andM;Certain settings of a Therac 25 linear accelerator called for radiation to beapplied through a metal plate that changes and reduces the beam intensity.andO;An unforeseen combination of commands failed to activate the plate, so thesoftware calculated the dosage incorrectly.andP;  The result was disastrous.andP;  Twopeople died; another was badly burned.andM;This may sound like a freak occurrence, but Food and Drug AdministrationCommissioner Frank Young, speaking at a dinner for the National Library ofMedicine, read off a list of close to a dozen less serious incidents wheresoftware failures were suspected.andM;Furthermore, industry observers say that more such errors can be expected asmedical instruments incorporate increasing amounts of software.andP;  Even withthe best current technology, the possibility of software bugs cannot becompletely eliminated.andM;That reality is raising some hotly debated practical, legal, and moralissues: Because of the potential for error, should computes be banned frommedicine?andP;  Should the government regulate the sales of software used inclinical applications?andP;  How do you inspect the software-programming process?andM;&quot;Certainly no decent society tolerates repeated fatalities or seriousinjuries once we know the cause,&quot; advises Professor Vincent Brannigan, whoteaches product liability and government regulation at the University ofMaryland and law and technology at Georgetown Universit+ Law School.andP;  Butwhen evaluating the technology, he points out, we have to look at the realchoices.andP;  &quot;The standard should be improvement over manual alternatives, notperfection.&quot;andM;Software problems are not unique to medicine.andP;  Banks worry about the accuracyof their accounts, airlines worry about the efficiency of theirpassenger-reservation systems.andP;  Medical software, however, along with thesoftware used in nuclear power plants and by the military, for example, is ina different class.andM;According to manufacturers, the medical-device industry is already takingappropriate steps.andP;  &quot;We would never ship a product with a knownpatient-safety bug,&quot; insists Rick Beebe, a research and development managerwith Hewlett-Packard in Waltham, Mass.andP;  &quot;We try to anticipate both the useand the misuse of the software,&quot; adds Richard Fries, former manager ofreliability assurance at Ohmeda (Madison, Wisc.), a maker of devices such asinfant-care monitors and anesthesia equipment.andM;The government steps inandM;However, even the best efforts can't guarantee absolute success, warns Dr.andO;Ruth Dayhoff, a medical-computer expert in the Washington, D.C., area.andP;  &quot;Youhave to be able to define what a device could do that's dangerous.&quot;andP;  Inaddition, cautions Roger Schneider, former associate director for science atthe FDA's Center for Device and Radiological Health, &quot;Microprocessors havemade it possible for fairly naive people to implement complex systems quitequickly.&quot;andM;The testing of medical software isn't always rigorous.andP;  &quot;Most softwareundergoes a level of checkout that's perhaps 10% of what's needed,&quot; saysEdward Miller, president of consulting and testing firm Software Research(San Francisco).andP;  The industry's lack of rigor has also caught thegovernment's attention.andP;  If medical devices are computerized systems, the FDAclaims jurisdiction over their manufacture, marketing, and use.andP;  While somepeople say it took the radiation-overdose deaths to get some seriousattention, FDA managers say the agency has actually shown increasing interestin computers for years.andM;The FDA already regulates computer systems in drug manufacturing.andP;  Theagency, as well as the Congressional Subcommittee on Investigations andOversight, has also started looking into the role of artificial-intelligencetechniques such as expert systems.andM;The FDA reserves the right to regulate any computer product that directlyconnects to a medical device.andP;  The level of regulation woulde depend onwhether the device performed routine data collection and manipulationfunctions, recommended specific courses of action, or actually controlled amedical procedure.andM;In the latter category, the FDA further distinguishes between devices thatoperate automatically and those controlled by expert system in which there isan opportunity for &quot;competent human intervention.&quot;andP;  If a medical practitionerhas to examine and approve proposed actions before proceeding, then the FDAis prepared to grant the manufacturer more regulatory latitude.andM;The current FDA policy in this area, coupled with any regulations andguidelines the FDA might subsequently issue, could shape the industrydecisively.andP;  And when you add the possibility of multimillion-dollarlawsuits, you have quite a controlling influence on computer-run medicaldevice.andM;While the FDA ponders its next move, the instruments continue to arrive.andP;  Aslong as the instruments are subservient to human judgment, most doctorsapprove.andP;  &quot;We're used to working with equipment whose use has inherentproblems.andP;  We have the same problems with humans--we all make mistakes,&quot;comments Dr. Neal Cohen, director of the intensive-care unit at the MedicalCenter of the University of California, San Francisco.andM;Cohen points out that both mechanical and software-controlled machines arealready essential in many areas of medicine.andP;  &quot;We have patients who are onmechanical breathing machines.andP;  We don't stand and watch the machine;essentially, we have equipment monitoring the equipment,&quot; he says.andM;In addition, a doctor can commit an error of omission by failing to use thetechnology, says Dr. Beverley Kane, a research physician at StanfordUniversity.andP;  &quot;There's an ethical issue in not using computers, not usingmedical data-bases, not using expert systems,&quot; she says.andP;  Doctors can't justavoid the machines.andP;  On the other hand, she admits, &quot;not a program in theworld is bug-free enough to trust a human life to.&quot;andM;According to Professor Brannigan, the broader question for society is Are webetter off pushing the technology further, gathering the benefits, andaccepting the occasional mistakes?andP;  &quot;My belief,&quot; he says, &quot;is that it's worththe occasional injury or death.&quot;andM;Although the industry's largely favorable record is reassuring, &quot;We're onlyat the very beginning of the problem,&quot; Brannigan warns.andM;Does that mean that a patient in a clinic or hospital should worry about thequality of the programmer as well as of the health-care practitioner?andP;  &quot;Ifyou're going in for radiation therapy,&quot; says Scheider, &quot;I'd worry about it.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
