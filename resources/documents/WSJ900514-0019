Mr. Bush, Chief of Staff John Sununu and Budget DirectorRichard Darman attempted to repair the damage Mr. Sununu didlast week when he told reporters that Democrats could proposetaxes, but that the White House would reject them. All threesought to return to previous declarations that the bipartisantalks begin tomorrow with &quot;no preconditions.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Sununu was more cautious yesterday, saying on NBC's&quot;Meet the Press&quot; that &quot;The White House would be likely tolook askance&quot; at taxes. He displayed a modicum of flexibilityby noting that the administration finds some &quot;user fees andother revenue raisers&quot; more acceptable than others.   And, given the opportunity on several occasions during histelevision appearance, Mr. Sununu declined to repeat thepresident's no-new-taxes campaign pledge.   Democrats are proceeding with the talks, but with greatwariness that the administration is setting a trap to blamethem for the tax increases that are certain to be part of anysignificant deficit-reduction package. With each sideinsisting publicly that the other be the first to propose anytax increases, the talks could bog down. But the point ofclosed-door bargaining is to find a way to share the blamefor an unpopular combination of spending cuts and taxincreases. Accused by one reporter yesterday of beingdeliberately vague, Mr. Darman said, &quot;That's constructive.&quot;   &quot;The tricky part is getting all of the parties to get fromwhere they are right at the moment to what they might agreeon without getting themselves in such an argument that thething falls through,&quot; Mr. Darman said on ABC's &quot;This Weekwith David Brinkley.&quot;   Mr. Bush sought out reporters aboard Air Force One onFriday in an acknowledged attempt to restore Democrats'confidence in his good faith. &quot;I made this proposal that wemeet with no conditions, and that's exactly the way it'sgoing to be.&quot; He wouldn't talk about his willingness or lackthereof to accept tax increases. &quot;I'm not going to show youmy hand,&quot; he said.   Dismissing suggestions that Mr. Sununu might be in troublefor roiling the waters before negotiations began, Mr. Bushinsisted it is &quot;silly . . . stupid&quot; to suggest his chief ofstaff is in hot water. The president expects more flaps overthe tax question before the negotiations are concluded.&quot;Tomorrow there'll be another tidal wave, so keep yoursnorkel above the water level and do what you think isright,&quot; he said.   Democrats seemed prepared to accept Mr. Bush's assurances.Senate Finance Chairman Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas),accompanying Mr. Bush on his flight to Texas, said that thebudget summit is &quot;back on track -- as long as we keep thesefellows in line who are trying to redefine it.&quot;   But Mr. Sununu once again ruffled feathers on CapitolHill, asserting yesterday on NBC that the catalyst for thepresident's invitation to talk isn't so much the economy, butthe inadequacies of Congress. Acknowledging that Mr. Bush'sbudget plan isn't sufficient, Mr. Sununu complained that &quot;thefailure of Congress to do any constructive revision . . .since the president sent it up is part of the problem wehave.&quot;   In response, Senate Budget Committee Chairman James Sasser(D., Tenn.) said, &quot;The chief of staff is off base onceagain.&quot; He suggested pointedly that Mr. Sununu leavenegotiating to Mr. Bush and Mr. Darman.   Mr. Darman said that negotiators should aim at a packageto cut the deficit by between $45 billion and $55 billion --even though he said meeting deficit targets set by theGramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law would require between $50billion and $100 billion in cuts, or &quot;over $100 billion&quot; ifall the spending on the thrift industry bailout is included.Part of any agreement is likely to be the exclusion of thriftspending from the Gramm-Rudman calculations.   The Gramm-Rudman law sets a deficit target of $64 billionfor fiscal 1991, which begins Oct. 1. If Congress and thepresident fail to reach a compromise, deep across-the-boardspending cuts will be triggered in October.</TEXT></DOC>
