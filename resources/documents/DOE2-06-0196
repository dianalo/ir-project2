<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-06-0196 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the 1982 amendment of the Constituion Act of Canada, the only sectionto affect directly the diversion of powers between the federal and provinciallevels of government was the natural resource amendment, section 92A.After tracing the recent history leading up to the amdendment this paperuses economic theory to evaluate its likely implications for naturalresouce taxation, conservation and trade policies. The main contributionof the resource amendment is to clarify the provincial role in the resourcesector by attacking some of the sore spots which arose in the 1970s inSaskatchewan, particularly that related to provincial taxation of privatelyheld resources. But the amendment did not come to grips with some clearlyimportant, historically recurrent, issues related to the control of resources.Water is neglected, except incidentally as it affects hydroelectricityproduction. The &quot;nothing derogates&quot; clause, 92A(6), shores up the greatermanagement powers related to ownership of resources, and the consequentasymmetry between Crown and freehold resources. Similarly, the incentivesto Crown ownership and to the establishment of provincial Crown corporationsinherent in section 125 have been retained. In addition, the highly chargedissue of revenue sharing was left to the political negotiating process,through fiscal accords. Section 92A did not attempt to resolve the differencesover resource control and revenue sharing that resurfaced in the 1970s.For this reason, it did not go far enough. By dealing with the particularproblems it did address, however, the resource amendment has made anadvance in allowing for more efficient natural resource policy-making.28 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
