Extravagant, selfish, ambitious and daring to the point ofimprudence, Mrs. Gardner, as she was always called, was known forher ability to swig beer and heft an ax like the men of the day.She was a woman who did everything a proper Boston woman of thelate 19th and early 20th centuries would not do.   In taking a priceless cache of art from her former home onSunday, two thieves violated Mrs. Gardner's cardinal rule by movingher paintings from their assigned locations.   ``She was an amazing character,'' said Cleveland Amory, authorof ``The Proper Bostonians,'' an account of the city's``Brahmins.'' ``She was a very individual person.''   Tales of Mrs. Gardner's exploits abound. She was known to walkdown the city's Tremont Street with her pet lion, Rex, on a leash.When she gave parties at her Beacon Street home she greeted herguests not from the door, but perched on a branch in a tree.   Wealth was never novel to Mrs. Gardner. She was the daughter ofa successful New York dry goods merchant and married John LowellGardner, son of the last of Boston's East India merchants, in 1860.   But while other turn-of-the-century Boston bluebloods playeddown their riches, Mrs. Gardner flaunted hers.   Warned by other high-society Boston women that she should keepher jewels tucked away in a safe deposit box, she had two of herlargest diamonds set on gold wires so she could wear them likeantennae.   In 1898, shortly after her husband died, she had a nervousbreakdown. When she recovered, doctors suggested she take up ahobby, which became her museum.   A 15th century Venetian palace was dismantled and brought toBoston, where Mrs. Gardner supervised its incorporation into herhome and museum. The museum is frozen in time: Nothing may bealtered, nothing may be moved from its assigned place, nothing maybe loaned, nothing may be sold and nothing may be added to thecollection.   Peter Sutton, curator of Boston's Museum of Fine Arts, calledthe Gardner Museum one of three great art collections assembled byturn-of-the-century aristocrats. He said the others are those ofthe Frick in New York and of attorney John G. Johnson, now at thePhiladelphia Museum of Art.   ``The Gardner is a testament to another era,'' Sutton said.``It's not only important because of the works it houses, butimportant to the history of American art collecting. It's a greattribute to old style, blue-chip collecting.''   While Mrs. Gardner footed the bill for the museum'sconstruction, she wasn't afraid to get her hands dirty. Shepersonally supervised the building, to the point of climbing onscaffolds to mix paint to the precise color she sought.   Whenever she worked, a trumpeter stood nearby to summon workmen,one note for the architect, another for the plumber, and so on.   ``She was there every damn day,'' Amory said. ``Once, shegrabbed an ax to hew a heavy beam to show workmen how it should bedone.''   The official opening of the museum was celebrated with a gala onJan. 1, 1903. Only workmen had seen the inside of the palace.Confronted with the problem of testing the acoustics in the musicroom before the ball, Mrs. Gardner had a characteristic solution.She contacted the Perkins Institute for the Blind and gathered anaudience of blind children for an afternoon concert and test run.   Mrs. Gardner lived in the top floor of the mansion until herdeath in 1924 at age 85. But she opened her home and its collectionto the public long before then.   She built the collection with the help of a young Lithuanianimmigrant named Bernard Berenson, who became one of the mostrespected art historians.   On her own, Gardner convinced T. Jefferson Coolidge to loan herSargent's ``El Jaleo,'' and then never gave it back. To protect herstolen prize, she built a cloister around the work, making itnearly impossible to remove.   The collection contains 290 paintings and 280 pieces ofsculpture, as well as religious objects, period furniture,textiles, ceramics and documents and books by famous writers andpolitical figures.   Amory said the museum is unique because it bore the indeliblestamp of Mrs. Gardner's personality.   ``Others, like Frick, had more money and bigger collections,''Amory said. ``But the personality of the Gardner Museum is hers.It's one person's taste and one person's castle.''</TEXT></DOC>
