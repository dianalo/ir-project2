The 0.2 percentage point increase from a 14-year-low joblessrate of 5.4 percent was accompanied by an increase of 173,000 inthe number of people listed by the Labor Department as officiallyunemployed.   The department said the labor force, those either holding jobsor actively looking for them, shrunk by 363,000 to 122.7 million.   The figures are based on a monthly survey of the nation'shouseholds. The rate is seasonally adjusted to discount forperiodic, predictable influences on the calculations.   A separate survey of employer payrolls showed the economycreating 210,000 jobs in May, but that was down from an average jobgrowth over the last year of 250,000 a month.   ``Almost all of the payroll job increase took place in theservice-producing sector,'' said Janet L. Norwood, the commissionerof labor statistics.   Ms. Norwood told the congressional Joint Economic Committee thatjob growth in business services, which has accounted for one ineight new jobs over the six-year economic expansion, has slowed toan average of 15,000 in each of the last three months, comparedwith an average monthly gain of 35,000-40,000 in 1987.   Manufacturing employment grew by only 16,000 in May after a45,000-job gain in April. Construction employment fell by 16,000following a rise of 157,000 from January through April.   The 0.2 percentage point drop in April's jobless rate _ thefirst since October's small 0.1 percentage point rise and a matchto the 0.2 percent gain recorded in September 1986 _ had beenpropelled largely by assembly line hiring as manufacturers tried tokeep with the surging foreign demand for American products.   Ms. Norwood called May's 16,000 new factory jobs ``no realchange.'' But she said that both the machinery and metal productsindustries had registered job growth over the month.   ``The two export-influenced industries have paced the gains inmanufacturing over the last year, along with electrical equipment,printing and publishing, chemicals and rubber and plasticproducts.''   The rebound in manufacturing has been accompanied by stronggrowth in wholesale trade, which added 25,000 jobs last month.   Over the last year, the Labor Department said, such employmenthas climbed by 275,000, three-fourths of it in durable goodsdistribution.   Meanwhile, employment in finance, insurance and real estate fellby 10,000 after a 2,000-job drop in April.   The financial industry, which includes banks and brokerages, hadbeen one of the strongest areas of job growth through much of therecovery, but has lost a total of 10,000 jobs since January.   The biggest area of job growth last month was health serviceswith 35,000 new jobs, a reflection of the fact that the Americanpopulation is gradually aging.   ``More jobs have been created'' in this area ``over the lastyear than in any previous year,'' Ms. Norwood said. In that time,380,000 health-care jobs have been created.   She added, ``Our projections suggest that several of the healthindustries will be among the 10 fastest-growing sources ofemployment during the next decade.''   While the household survey, on which the jobless rate is based,showed a seasonally adjusted decline of 518,000 people at work, theunadjusted figures showed an increase of more than 300,000.   Ms. Norwood called the unadjusted increase ``very low byhistorical standards and considerably lower'' than last May's 1.3million unadjusted job gain.   The unadjusted data for the period of April through July canvary significantly.   ``In past years, when May employment growth has been relativelyweek, substantial expansions generally occurred in June or July,''she said. ``It would be premature to draw any firm conclusionsabout the direction of civilian employment from this one-monthhousehold survey. At this time of the year, I believe, it's moreappropriate to focus on the business survey, which shows continued_ although somewhat slower _ growth.''   An alternate rate, including the 1.7 million members of thearmed services stationed in the United States, also rose in May, to5.5 percent.   The department gave this breakdown of civilian unemployment:   _Whites, 4.7 percent, up from 4.6 percent.   _Blacks, 12.4, up from 12.2.   _Hispanics, 9.0, down from 9.3.   _Men, 5.5, up from 5.2.   _Women, 5.6, unchanged.   _Teenagers, 15.6, down from 15.9.   _Black teenagers, 36.6, up from 35.5.   The export boom, unbridled consumer demand domestically and anupward pressure on wages from the tightening job market havetriggered widespread fears of inflation.   So far, however, there is little evidence that the decliningunemployment rate has triggered any significant wage-push inflation.   ``We're lucky in that the latest shift in demand is stimulatingthe Rust Belt, where there was a tremendous labor force that hasbeen underemployed,'' said William Dunkelberg, dean of the businessschool at Temple University in Philadelphia. ``We can tap that forawhile before we start running into inflation problems.''   Two years ago, the consensus among private economists was thatany jobless rate below 6 percent would trigger an inflationaryspiral. When that figure was reached with only a 2 percent increasein consumer prices, economists lowered their so-called``non-inflationary full employment rate'' to 5.5 percent.   Those numbers are again being revised downward, with FederalReserve Chairman Alan Greespan recently telling Congress that heforesees no inflationary problem from wages until the jobless rateapproaches 5 percent.   The consensus from a survey of 49 private economists last monthby Blue Chip Financial Forecasts, a newsletter edited by analystRobert Eggert of Sedona, Ariz., was that the unemployment ratecould fall to 4.9 percent before raising inflation problems.</TEXT></DOC>
