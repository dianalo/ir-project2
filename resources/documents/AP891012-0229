The Moroccan High Command claimed 101 Polisario Front fightersdied in the ``suicide attack'' Wednesday on the defense line atHauza, 30 miles south of the Moroccan border, and that 11Moroccans, including an officer, were killed.   Moroccan officials said the guerrillas' casualty claims werepropaganda.   ``This is their habitual tactic,'' said one Moroccan armyofficer. ``They claim an impossible number of Moroccan casualtiesto conceal their own serious losses.''   A statement issued in Algeria by the Polisario Front said amongthose killed in Wednesday's pre-dawn battle was Lt. AhmedCharboudi, while 36 Moroccans, including Capt. Abdel Hadroui, weretaken prisoner. Polisario said nothing about its own casualties.   Wednesday's raid followed a bloody tank battle Saturday in whichMorocco said a colonel and 13 other soldiers were killed at GueltaZenmour, a town central Western Sahara near the Mauritanian border.   The new Polisario offensive coincides with a pending vote in theUnited Nations General Assembly on whether to hold a referendumamong the 80,000 inhabitants registered as living in the WesternSahara before Spain pulled out in 1975.   U.N. Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar has been seekinga solution to the 14-year-old struggle between Morocco and thePolisario for control of the vast mineral-rich territory.   The Polisario had observed a self-imposed cease-fire sinceFebruary which was intended to allow peace talks with Morocco'sKing Hassan II a chance to succeed. Hassan later broke off thetalks, calling them ``pointless.''   A Polisario official in Algiers said the king's decision forcedthe guerrillas to ``reluctantly take up arms again.''   But the official Moroccan news agency said the king had canceleda new round of talks to have been held in Morocco because of thelatest Polisario attacks.   Moroccan officials in Rabat said the Polisario no longer enjoysthe strong Algerian backing it once had, and as a result has beenforced to move its main military supply base from the Algerianoasis of Tindouf, near the Moroccan border, to the Mauritanianoutpost of Bir Moghrein.   Bir Moghrein lies south of Hauza and east of Guelta Zemour.Moroccan military officials believe attacks on both points werelaunched from Bir Moghrein, an area of northern Mauritania withvirtually no government troops.   Moroccan press reports earlier in the week warned that Hassan'stroops might exercise ``hot pursuit'' into Mauritania unless theneighboring nation takes action against the Polisario forces.   Most of the 10,000-strong Mauritanian army is deployed in thesouth facing Senegal.   Most of Polisario's military supplies from various leftist ThirdWorld sources presently arrive at the Mauritanian port ofNouadhibou, where they are unloaded there by Polisariosympathizers, diplomatic sources said.</TEXT></DOC>
