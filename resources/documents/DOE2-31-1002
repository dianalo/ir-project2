Peculiarities ofdeterminable impurities concerned with their wide distribution in theenvironment and high chemical activity are noted. A detailed characteristicsof papers on nuclear-physical (mainly activation), vacuum-extractionand electrochemical methods of analysis are given. Metrologic characteristicsof the methods in question are estimated taking account of surface contaminationeffect on the analysis results. 47 refs.; 1 fig.; 6 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
