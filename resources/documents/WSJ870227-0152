SchlenderStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS of the hard sciences and mathematics aren't the only ones in academia using computers these days. Scholars of language, literature and music are finding that the machines can open up new horizons in their work and greatly reduce tedious research.    Classicists at the University of California, Irvine, for example , have transcribed all the written works of ancient Greece up to A.D. 600 -- 62 million words worth -- onto a single optical computer disk. Students of dance at San Francisco State University use Apple Computer Inc. Macintosh personal computers to choreograph performances. At Stanford University, history students learn about 17th century France by playing computerized simulations of the life of a social-climbing Frenchman. In recent years, scholars of English literature used a computer to identify a long lost sonnet of Shakespeare and to pin down the year Ernest Hemingway wrote &quot;The Old Man and the Sea.&quot;    &quot;In every department there's a growing minority of scholars who have turned on to this new technology,&quot; says Bryan Pfaffenberger, who teaches at the University of Virginia and is the author of books on the use of computers in the liberal arts. &quot;It's a quiet phenomenon, though,&quot; says Joseph Raben, a former English professor who is the founder and editor of Computer and the Humanities, a scholarly journal. &quot;I think a lot of people in the humanities are still a little nervous about these machines, but they are beginning to recognize that they can be used sensitively and intelligently.&quot;    FOR YEARS, humanities scholars used computers mainly to search data bases of literature to compile concordances lists of words and phrases and their contexts -- or to perform content analysis. That's still true. Practically every major author and genre of literature has a data base containing works, letters and reference materials. Overseas, France's Tresor de la Langua Francaise contains 1,700 complete works of French writing since 1789. England's Oxford Text Archive contains selections of most major English language literary figures from Chaucer to Bob Dylan.    &quot;Data bases allow you to accomplish in 30 minutes what used to take years in the library,&quot; says John J. Hughes, a specialist in biblical and classical studies from Whitefish, Mont., who publishes a computer newsletter for humanities scholars, Bits andamp; Bytes.    Not only are data bases becoming larger and more accessible, they are also getting more diverse and sophisticated. Walter B. Hewlett, the son of a Hewlett-Packard Co. founder, is a quarter of the way through transcribing on computer the works of Johann Sebastian Bach in complete musical notation. Other musical data bases store works of Mozart and baroque guitar music.    COINCIDENTALLY, David W. Packard, the son of the other namesake of Hewlett-Packard, is a classicist who has developed two computers that can read, analyze and translate text in six languages, including Greek, Latin, Hebrew and Coptic.    Mr. Hewlett, who directs the Center for Computer Aided Research in the Humanities in Palo Alto, Calif., and uses one of Mr. Packard's Ibycus computers in his own studies, contends that &quot;our understanding of the possibilities for computer-aided research outstrips the capabilities of conventional hardware and software available today.&quot; He has had, for example, great difficulty simply finding software that can consistently and accurately encode and print compositions in his Bach data base.    It is the personal computer, however, that is making the biggest change in the way humanities scholars work. &quot;This is a productivity device,&quot; says the University of Virginia's Mr. Pfaffenberger. &quot;I can crank out papers faster than ever before just because it's so much easier than old-fashioned typing.&quot; He concedes that improved productivity in academia could have its drawbacks. &quot;This plays into the hands of university administration in an almost insidious way,&quot; he says. &quot;I worry that computers reinforce the notion that what counts most toward tenure and promotion for young faculty members is the sheer bulk of work they can produce.&quot;    NEVERTHELESS, as more faculty members use personal computers in their offices, and more students use them at home, they can only play a bigger role in scholarly research, especially as new software comes along. &quot;There's a lot more than just concordances and drill and practice software out there now, &quot; says Katie Povejsil, a manager in Apple Computer's higher education division. Apple itself funds software development on several college campuses, much of it in the humanities. Software developed with Apple's help include music composition and theory programs, writing analysis programs, and a theatrical staging simulator in which a director can try out various ways of arranging and moving actors in a play.    Some worry that by embracing the computer, the humanities could well lose some of their humanity. But others are concerned that if liberal arts schools and scholars don't adopt the computer quickly, they will fall behind the rest of academia. &quot;We're starting to see a power elite among colleges and universities based on information, not money,&quot; says James Schwartz, an English professor at South Dakota School of Mining and Technology and editor of a newsletter, Research and Word Processing. &quot;The bigger and better schools already are wired up with computers, but if the rest of them -- especially the small liberal arts colleges -- don't get started now, they'll always be behind.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
