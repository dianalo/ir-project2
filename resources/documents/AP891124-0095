Little known to the public at large _ his name doesn't evenappear in Who's Who _ Tempelsman has contacts across the continentfrom when he started doing business more than three decades ago.   The 60-year-old businessman is on a first-name basis withArchbishop Desmond Tutu, South Africa's anti-apartheid activist; iscalled ``grand-pere'' by Gabon's President El Hadj Omar Bongo; andentertains Zaire President Sese Seko Mobutu.   Until recently, the balding, portly teddy bear of a man,preferred to remain behind the scenes.   In 1989, Tempelsman became the board chairman of the prestigiousAfrican-American Institute, the country's oldest nonprofitorganization dedicated to improving relations between thecontinents.   In that capacity, he's delivered lectures and continued totravel to Africa as often as every two months.   As an astute businessman, Tempelsman has cultivated Africans onall sides of the political spectrum. He recently set up an officein mineral-rich Namibia in advance of November's elections, aprecursor to independence in the South Africa-run territory.   Over the years, he's been criticized from the left because ofhis ties to DeBeers Consolidated Mines Ltd., which mines diamondsfrom South Africa, among other places, and for once hiring theCIA's top Africa official when the man retired from the agency.   The right recently questioned Tempelsman's dealings withSoviet-backed Angola. Tempelsman said he has a ``commercialrelationship'' with that country's National Diamond Co. The Angolangovernment is embroiled in civil war with U.S.-backed rebels led byJonas Savimbi.   Howard Phillips of the Conservative Caucus, a lobbying group,also has suggested that Tempelsman may have had something to dowith Angola's contract to sell oil to Citizens Corp., aBoston-based energy company started by Rep. Joe Kennedy, D-Mass.,Mrs. Onassis' nephew.   Tempelsman pooh-poohs these attacks as coming from a ``group ofzealots who look at things from a conspiratorial point of view.''   Rep. Howard Wolpe, D-Mich., chairman of the House Africasubcommittee, said Tempelsman frequently has attended the panel'shearings.   Tempelsman, who generally favors economic sanctions againstwhite-ruled South Africa, recently fought efforts to include uncutdiamonds in the sanctions bill, Wolpe said.   With the help of his lawyer, Theodore Sorenson, formerspeechwriter for the late President Kennedy, Tempelsman helpedpersuade Wolpe and others that diamond sanctions would hurtcountries like Botswana more than South Africa because uncutdiamonds are not identified by their country of origin.   A staunch Democrat, Tempelsman gives freely to the party as wellas to its political candidates.   Nevertheless, he praised Reagan administration officials forbrokering a plan that led to elections in Namibia and an agreementto withdraw Cuban troops from Angola.   Tempelsman is the chief executive officer of Lazare KaplanInternational, a diamond-cutting concern, as well as a generalpartner in Leon Tempelsman and Son Inc., an investment company withinterest in minerals, agriculture and industry.   In a wide-ranging interview at his penthouse office overlookingNew York's Fifth Avenue, the Belgium-born Tempelsman reflected onhow his business interests merged with his appreciation for Africa,and how he sees the future of the world's least-developed continent.   His office, guarded by a tight security system, is tastefullyfurnished with African art. All around are books and magazinesdealing with art, from Africa and the Greek and Roman periods.   ``One is fortunate when career interests and philosophicalinterests coincide,'' he said. ``It's always nicer to work atsomething you like doing.''   The Tempelsman family came to the United States around World WarII. But Tempelsman didn't get involved in Africa until businesstook him to Ghana, the former Gold Coast, in the mid-1950s.   Decolonization, which has taken place over the last threedecades, has been one of the ``more historical events in mankind'shistory,'' Tempelsman said. ``I think Namibia is the last chapter.''   While Tempelsman has prospered in part because of Africa'sminerals, some countries have seen their standards of livingdecline and their people embroiled in endless civil wars.   Describing nation-building as a ``risky adventure,'' Tempelsmansaid, ``That continent is going through an agonizing period, mostlyeconomic, some self-inflicted, some subject to other factors.''   To alleviate some countries' problems, Tempelsman favors actionfrom Washington to wipe out some of their debt as well as more aid.   Generally, though, Tempelsman said foreigners can't dictate toAfricans how they should run their countries.   ``It has to come from their own internal processes,'' he said.``We can hector and condemn, but in the end both the benefits andthe fruit of political independence mean you have the right to makeyour own mistakes.''</TEXT></DOC>
