Bush refused to say what steps might be taken. ``We areconsidering appropriate responses if these threats areimplemented,'' Bush said.   In an interview Monday with a group of foreign journalists, thepresident said, ``I want to be sure anything we do is productive.There's been dramatic change in the world and I don't want toinadvertently take some action that would set it back.''   ``And yet, I don't want to be seen as one who is not interestedin the peaceful change and in the self-determination forLithuania,'' Bush said in the interview. A transcript of hisremarks was released today.   Bush issued his warning after Soviet officials ordered sharpcuts in natural gas supplies to Lithuania and said reductions inoil and gasoline will begin on Wednesday.   ``Obviously we are watching the situation very, very closely,''Bush said, commenting during a picture-taking session in the OvalOffice with visiting President Rafael Callejas of Honduras.   ``We're waiting to see if the Soviet announcements areimplemented,'' Bush said. ``Clearly those announcements arecontrary to the approach that we have urged and that others haveurged upon the Soviet Union.   ``We are considering appropriate responses if these threats areimplemented,'' Bush said. ``And I'm going to leave it right there.''   Bush concluded by saying, ``What we need is dialogue, discussionand a peaceful resolution of this great difficulty there.''   The president planned to meet on the subject later in the daywith Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, who led aSenate delegation to Moscow last week, and Minority leader BobDole, R-Kan. Both lawmakers have criticized the Soviet ultimatum.   Dole said Congress might act on its own to retaliateeconomically against Moscow if it escalated its efforts to blockLithuania's drive toward independence.   Mitchell said Gorbachev's threat was contrary to the assurancesthat he and other senators had received from the Soviet leader inMoscow that force or intimidation would not be used.   The president has repeatedly warned that Soviet pressuresagainst Lithuania put U.S.-Soviet relations at risk.   At a news conference last Friday, Bush told Moscow that ``now isno time for escalation. It's time for talk.'' He made the commentafter Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev set a 48-hour deadlinefor Lithuania to revoke legislation it had passed since its March11 declaration of independence, or face cutoff of critical supplies.   In recent weeks, high-level U.S. officials have been meeting toconsider what steps the administration might take in response tovarious Soviet actions against Lithuania. Most of the optionsapparently involve economic measures, such as denying Moscowimproved trade status or blocking its entry into internationaleconomic organizations.</TEXT></DOC>
