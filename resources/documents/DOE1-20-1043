The presentmethods that are employed to access data bases fall into two main categoriesof menu-driven systems and use of data base manipulation languages. Bothof these methods are currently used by NPRDS. These methods have provento be tedious, however, and require extensive training by the user foreffective utilization of the data base. Artificial intelligence techniqueshave been used in the development of several intelligent front ends fordata bases in nonnuclear domains. Lunar is a natural language programfor interface to a data base describing moon rock samples brought backby Apollo. Intellect is one of the first data base question-answeringsystems that was commercially available in the financial area. Ladderis an intelligent data base interface that was developed as a managementaid to Navy decision makers. A natural language interface for nucleardata bases that can be used by nonprogrammers with little or no trainingprovides a means for achieving this goal for this industry.</TEXT></DOC>
