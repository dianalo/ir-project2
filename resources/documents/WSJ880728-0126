Carlos Salinas de Gortari of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, was declared the winner in the July 6 elections with 50.3% of the vote, his party's worst-ever showing. Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, leader of a left-wing coalition, received 31.2%. Manuel Clouthier, who heads a pro-business party with ties to the Roman Catholic Church, tallied 17%.    But the delay in releasing election results continues to fuel accusations of rampant fraud. Mr. Cardenas and Mr. Clouthier are traveling the country, they say, to try to keep their supporters' enthusiasm inflamed until Sept. 1, when the presidential election results are subject to ratification by a majority of the newly elected Congress, where the PRI has 260 seats to the opposition's 240 seats.    If all the opposition deputies vote against Mr. Salinas, the PRI leader would face the embarrassment of a victory recognized only by members of his own party. There is an even worse possibility for the PRI: Mr. Cardenas's Democratic Front, which was started by PRI dissidents, might win over some disaffected PRI deputies, especially union leaders and old-style party bosses who feel threatened by Mr. Salinas's calls for economic and political liberalization. It wouldn't require many breaks in the PRI ranks to deprive Mr. Salinas of his majority and force a new election.    But PRI leaders say they aren't worried about the prospect of a united opposition. &quot;If the Roman Catholic businessmen and the communists want to make an alliance against us, good luck to them,&quot; says a PRI official, who sees increasing tensions in the opposition camp.    Indeed, some officials of Mr. Clouthier's National Action Party, known as the PAN, are beginning to express doubt that Mr. Salinas is their main enemy. &quot;There is definitely a difference of opinion within the party about how close we should get to the Democratic Front,&quot; says Norberto Corella, the PAN's secretary for national affairs.    The business sector of the PAN is frightened by Mr. Cardenas's populist rhetoric. &quot;Salinas is by far the lesser of two evils,&quot; says a PAN activist, who owns an export-oriented manufacturing company. &quot;It's time to concede Salinas's victory, because the uncertainty and the threat from Cardenas aren't good for our international prestige and our businesses.&quot;    Other PAN leaders have personal grievances against the Democratic Front. Longtime PAN leader Jesus Gonzalez Schmall was soundly beaten in the Mexico City senate race by Democratic Front leader Porfirio Munoz Ledo, an ex-PRI chairman. But Mr. Gonzalez claims that voting irregularities and the Front's reluctance to agree to a recount suggest that Mr. Munoz Ledo may have stolen the victory. &quot;Munoz Ledo was the leader of the PRI, and he has all of the contacts and experience to apply the electoral techniques of the PRI,&quot; says Mr. Gonzalez. Mr. Munoz Ledo has vigorously denied committing fraud.    Mr. Clouthier represents a more aggressive wing of the PAN that is eager to reach an accord with the Democratic Front -- perhaps more eager than the Front itself. At a rally last weekend, the burly Mr. Clouthier declared that he and Mr. Cardenas had reached a compromise over their conflicting claims of victory. Mr. Clouthier repeated the conversation he says he had with Mr. Cardenas: &quot;Neither you won, nor am I going to proclaim that I won, but we're going to shout together that Salinas didn't win. We're going to do all that we can so that the PRI candidate doesn't take over.&quot; At his rally, Mr. Clouthier said Mr. Cardenas would make a similar statement that same day.    But Mr. Cardenas's speech made no reference to an agreement with the PAN. &quot;We don't know what Clouthier was talking about,&quot; a Front leader said.    The PAN's Mr. Corella says there was a meeting but &quot;Mr. Cardenas didn't live up to what we understood to be the agreement. It was apparently a misunderstanding.&quot; Mr. Corella says Mr. Clouthier and Mr. Cardenas are negotiating a written accord that could be completed this weekend.    The Democratic Front also has been busy trying to maintain unity among its four ideologically distinct parties. The fractious left was brought together by this election because of Mexico's rapidly falling living standards and the personal appeal of Mr. Cardenas, the son of one of Mexico's most beloved presidents. In a first sign of solidarity after the election, the four leftist parties agreed to refuse to recognize Mr. Salinas's victory.    &quot;We can't accept the Salinas government because of the immoral way Salinas was chosen,&quot; says Mr. Munoz Ledo. &quot;We are trying to forge a pact with the PAN to fight the election result. I believe it is possible.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
