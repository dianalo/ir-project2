(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A farm couple who hired drifters to buycattle was charged Monday with killing three former employees whosebodies were found in northern Missouri barns last month.   Attorney General William Webster announced the filing offirst-degree murder charges against Ray Copeland, 75, ofMooresville, and his wife, Faye, 68, at a news conference at theLivingston County Jail.   The Copelands have been held in the jail since Oct. 9 on chargesof conspiracy to steal cattle with bad checks from an account setup for an employee. The conspiracy charge was dismissed Monday, butneither Webster nor Prosecuting Attorney Doug Roberts would say why.   Webster said the decision to seek the death penalty was based onallegations that the victims were killed for money and to cover upanother crime.   The Copelands were not charged Monday in the death of a fourthman whose body was found in another barn more than a week later.Webster said medical examiners are reviewing evidence in that case.   Copeland, wearing a bright orange county-issued jumpsuit, wassilent and showed no emotion at his hearing. His bond was set at$500,000.   Mrs. Copeland, wearing a blue slicker and orange jail pants,also was held under $500,000 bond. She cried during her hearing andtried to make a statement before her lawyer advised her not to sayanything.   A search for bodies started Oct. 9 after a former employeealerted authorities that he had seen a human skull and leg bone atthe Copeland farm.   Bloodhounds and backhoes were used for a week at the Copelands'40-acre farm near Mooresville, 90 miles northeast of Kansas City.Some evidence _ weapons and papers _ was found, but no bodies wereunearthed.   Meanwhile, the North Central Missouri Major Case Squad, a teamof 20 officers from nine counties, was activated Oct. 13 to assistin the search, which was expanded to other farms in the area.   The decomposed bodies of three men were discovered three dayslater in shallow graves in a barn near Ludlow. The barn is on afarm about 12 miles south of Copeland's place where Copeland haddone odd jobs for several years.   Each of the men _ Paul J. Cowart, 21, of Dardanelle, Ark., JohnW. Freeman, 27, of Tulsa, Okla., and Jimmie Dale Harvey, 27, ofSpringfield, Mo. _ had been shot in the head. The charges filedMonday stem from their deaths.   The three victims had ties to a Springfield mission whereCopeland sometimes showed up to hire transients.   A fourth decomposed body was found Oct. 25 in a barn about threemiles away where Copeland also had done odd jobs for several years.The man, also killed by a gunshot to the head, has not beenidentified.   Investigators have said that as many as 20 drifters worked forthe Copelands since 1986. Nine of them remain unaccounted for,although digging has been halted and the major case squad disbanded.   Sheriff Leland O'Dell said Monday that authorities have searchedabout 100 sites.   Documents on the theft conspiracy charge in Livingston CountyCircuit Court say the Copelands intended to use a 57-year-oldtransient to buy cattle in August with bad checks, then sell thecattle and retain the proceeds. They opened a checking account andpost office box for the man, the conspiracy charge says.</TEXT></DOC>
