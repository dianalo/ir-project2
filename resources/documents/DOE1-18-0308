It is assumed that each radio source consists ofa flat-spectrum compact core moving with relativistic speed and steep-spectrumextended lobes. A luminosity function of steep-spectrum components isconstructed which is consistent with observations of the local luminosityfunction, source counts and redshift distribution of steep-spectrum sources.Using this, we calculate the source counts and redshift distributionsof flat-spectrum sources, which constrain the core Lorentz factor {gamma}and the intrinsic relative power of the core to lobes Rsub(T) at 5 GHz.It is found that the existing data are consistent with predictions ofthe model in which core properties are common for all radio sources.</TEXT></DOC>
