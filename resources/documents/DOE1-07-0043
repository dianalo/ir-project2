The effects ofadditional reinforcements were investigated in terms of strength andfracture morphology of composites. Both the longitudinal and transversestrengths of composites were improved by a small amount of whiskers orparticulates. The additional reinforcements act effectively to separatethe continuous fibers, resulting in the inhibition of the direct fibercontacts. As another improvement, the volume fraction of continuous fibercan be easily controlled by proper amounts of additional reinforcementsin the fabrication process of pressure casting. 9 references.</TEXT></DOC>
