The sizzling rally in late trading on the New YorkMercantile Exchange drove unleaded gasoline for June delivery2.38 cents a gallon higher. It settled at 65.79 cents.</LP><TEXT>   Pricing volatility had been expected for the June gasolinecontract this week because Thursday is its last day oftrading. But July gasoline also was up by nearly the two-centlimit. It settled at 62.96 cents a gallon, a gain of 1.96cents.   &quot;People are saying we could have a tight gasoline marketand that {the futures price} could get up to 70 cents again,&quot;said John Hill, a Merrill Lynch vice president.   The gasoline rally helped pull up other petroleum prices.In U.S. futures trading, the New York Mercantile Exchangecrude for July delivery was up 18 cents to $17.98 a barrel atthe close.   Before rebounding, the July crude had fallen to $17.45 abarrel, which traders later cited as a technical supportpoint. The August crude contract rose six cents to $18.58 abarrel.   Before trading began yesterday in the U.S., oil pricesappeared to be headed down. In European markets, spot pricesof North Sea crudes dropped between 40 cents and 50 cents abarrel, according to the Dow Jones International PetroleumReport.   But later the New York Merc rally developed and spread toLondon's International Petroleum Exchange, which has longtrading hours. On the IPE, Brent-blend crude futures closedeight cents to 23 cents a barrel higher.   There was news concerning the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries that may have helped turn around the weakoil market. Oil production in Gabon, an OPEC member, has beenhurt because of the civil unrest there. From Baghdad, wherethe Arab summit meeting is being held, the oil ministers ofSaudi Arabia, Iraq and the United Arab Emirates issued a newcall for OPEC members to abide by production quotas. Thatfollowed yesterday's report in this newspaper that monitorsof OPEC output expect to report May production down by as asmuch as 500,000 barrels a day.   There still is a huge surplus of crude oil overhangingworld petroleum markets, however. And by now, gasoline pricesusually have begun to firm, because this is what the oilindustry calls the driving season, which traditionally beginswith the Memorial Day weekend. Still, demand for gasoline hasbeen essentially flat.   But oil-market participants apparently are looking atsupplies rather than demand. &quot;We are coming into thehigh-demand season some 10 million barrels under a year ago{in gasoline inventories} and with low production,&quot; said JoeBongiorno, a vice president at Prudential-Bache Securities.   He and others cited the relatively low operating rates ofU.S. refineries and the fact that many of them are inprolonged shutdowns for maintenance. As a result, the next ofthe industry's weekly reports on U.S. oil statistics, to bereleased today, is generally expected to show anotherdrawdown in gasoline inventories. As of May 18, gasolineinventories totaled 213.2 million barrels, down from 221.3million a year earlier.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Due to heavy rains in recent weeks,nearly 27% of the U.S. soybean crop is in the ground,compared with 53% last year, according to an AgricultureDepartment report released after the close of futures tradingyesterday. The U.S. corn crop is 81% planted, compared with83% last year, which is roughly what many analysts hadexpected. All figures were for the week ended last Sunday.The 27% soybean planting figure was below many analysts'estimates of 30% to 40% planted, but isn't likely to sendsoybean futures prices soaring today. That's because weatherforecasts updated at noon yesterday called for much less rainthis week across many growing areas than had been earlierpredicted. &quot;We only need three to four sunny days to playcatch-up in soybeans,&quot; one analyst said. Also weighing onsoybean futures prices was an increase in soybean sales byBrazilian farmers, whose product was made cheaper oninternational markets because of a currency devaluation bythe Brazilian government, U.S. futures analysts said. Soybeanfutures for July delivery dropped 13 cents a bushel to closeat $6.06. July corn futures gained 0.25 cent a bushel toclose at $2.8425.                                                                                                          LIVESTOCK and MEATS: Most pork belly futures contractsclosed up the daily price limit of two cents a pound onmounting concerns that warehouse supplies of frozen porkbellies are at low levels relative to the traditional summerincrease in demand for bacon. An industry report releasedlate Friday showed that only five million pounds of porkbellies were added to storage in April, compared with anexpected increase of as much as 12 million pounds, saidCharles Levitt, a futures analyst with Shearson Lehman HuttonInc. in Chicago. As of May 1 there were 102.2 million poundsof bellies in storage, he said. That figure is larger thanthe 10-year average for bellies in storage on May 1, butsubstantially less than last year's 143.8 million pounds instorage. Movement of bellies into cold storage so far thismonth has totaled about one million pounds, compared to a10-year average of about seven million pounds of pork belliesstored in May, Mr. Levitt said. Pork belly futures for Julydelivery closed up two cents a pound at 67.85 cents on theChicago Mercantile Exchange.                                                                                                          SUGAR: Futures prices fell. The July contract opened nearits day's high at 14.63 cents a pound and steadily weakenedto as low as 13.90 cents before settling at 14.03 cents, off0.66 cent from Friday's close. The market was responding to anew F.O. Licht report that contained two pieces of bearishnews: Estimated production in the season ending Aug. 30 wasrevised upward to 108.55 million metric tons from a previousestimate of 107.91 million metric tons; consumption wasrevised down to 107.86 million metric tons from 108.07million previously. Judith Ganes, commodity analyst atMerrill Lynch in New York, said the market was given a shockof reality when it saw the net result of these estimatechanges switch from a 157,000-ton production deficit to a690,000-ton surplus. &quot;Though the market knew bearish figureswere probably on the way, seeing them in print was somewhatof a shock,&quot; she said. The market was hit by selling throughbrokerage firms -- which is how individual investors trade --by commodity funds and by professional floor traders known as&quot;locals.&quot; There could be some additional follow-throughselling, Ms. Ganes noted, as calls go out for investors toput up more money to maintain their positions. Even with therevised estimates, Ms. Ganes said supply and demand are stillin close balance and that the market could rally on verylittle news. Bernard Savaiko, senior commodity analyst atPaineWebber in New York, said the July contract fell below animportant support level at 14.08 cents. He said that the mostrecent Licht report clearly represents an important change inmarket fundamentals. &quot;The market was looking for a fifthconsecutive season in which consumption exceeded production,and it now realizes that it is not going to get it,&quot; Mr.Savaiko said. He also noted that people in the sugar industrygenerally believed a surplus wouldn't materialize until the1990-91 season.                                                                                                          COTTON: Prices of soonest-maturing futures contracts rose,with July jumping two cents, the daily price-move limit, to82.03 cents a pound. Other delivery months were up less oreven fell. According to Thomas Mueller, senior cotton analystat Merrill Lynch in New York, the limited strength wasapparently due to a very small stock of certified cottonavailable for delivery against the July contract. He notedthat only 49,366 bales are now available for delivery, andthat 3,868 of those bales are likely to be decertified. Heestimates that the number of July contracts outstanding isequivalent to more than 1.7 million bales. However, Mr.Mueller said he doesn't believe that a squeeze would actuallyoccur in the July contract, because he thinks the holders oflong positions will abandon them before the delivery periodstarts on June 25. &quot;Most traders should be out of the Julycontract long before June 25; the July contract is just toovolatile,&quot; said Mr. Mueller. He also said that many traderswere executing a strategy in which they bought July orOctober contracts and sold December, causing its price todecline. He added that the volume of trading was estimated atan unimpressive 7,000 contracts. Mr. Mueller said: &quot;It willbe difficult to sustain prices above 82 cents -- apsychologically important area.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
