Hall(D-Ohio) called a letter from Federal Communications Commission (FCC)Chairman Alfred C. Sikes concerning the hostile takeover of ATandamp;T by NCR &quot;abeginning of the federal oversight process,&quot; but he urged the FCC to initiatea formal inquiry open to comments by the public and interested parties.andM;Hall welcomed the commitment by members of the TelecommunicationsSubcommittee for agreeing to use the FCC authorization hearings as a forum toseek answers to questions raised by the possible merger.andM;&quot;The Sikes letter and congressional reaction raise the possibility that themerger might affect current FCC plans to relax restrictions against ATandamp;T's`bundling' telecommunications service and equipment,&quot; Hall said.andP;  &quot;In fact,there is a chance that restrictions might be strengthened as a result of thetakeover.andM;&quot;If ATandamp;T is faced with the possibility of existing or additional FCCregulations, it could choose to drop pursuit of NCR,&quot; he added.andM;Hall's comments were is response to a letter from Sikes to Reps.andP;  Edward J.andO;Markey (D-Mass.), Dennis E.

Eckart (D-Ohio) and Telecommunications and Finance Subcommittee ChairmanEdward Markey welcomed the prompt response of the chairman of the FederalCommunications Commission to questions they raised about ATandamp;T's takeover ofNCR Corp.andM;Sikes' reply on several points, however, was inconclusive and leftunaddressed several of their key concerns.andM;o  The FCC chairman contended that a comprehensive series of non-structuralsafeguards embodied in its Computer Inquiry III &quot;derive the efficiencies ofvertical integration, while also ensuring that ATandamp;T cannot gain an unfairadvantage in the CPE marketplace through its provision of long-distancetransmission services.&quot; The chairman, however, failed to mention that theCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit vacated these regulations and thatthey have not yet been replaced with permanent safeguards againstcross-subsidies.andM;o  The FCC chairman claimed that the dramatic growth in competition and theimplementation of price cap regulation will also safeguard continued faircompetition.andP;  This, however, does not take into consideration disappointingtrends in the long-distance market including an actual increase in ATandamp;T'sinterexchange market share last quarter.andP;  The price cap regulatory regime hasonly been in place for a year and its effects on consumers and competitorshave not been fully assessed.andM;&quot;We applaud the FCC chairman for his commitment to `carefully review' therecord in the ATandamp;T Dominance proceeding,&quot; said the members.andP;  &quot;We look forwardto working with him and the other commissioners to ensure the appropriatebundling restrictions are in place to protect consumers and competitors.andM;The members concluded:  &quot;As we conduct oversight hearings on the FCCauthorization and other pending proceedings before the commission, we willcontinue to probe the issues raised by our inquiry.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
