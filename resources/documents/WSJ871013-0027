Salomon's competitors fear, however, that they're not immune from the trading losses and shrinking profit margins that they believe prompted Salomon's plan to leave a game that it was winning. Salomon ranked No. 1 in tax-exempt underwriting during the first nine months of this year with a nearly 10% market share, according to Securities Data Co., a New York research firm.    Rather than focusing on the potential gains for themselves, many competitors were concerned that Salomon's decision would be taken as proof that the municipal bond business won't rebound from the slump it has been in since passage of the 1986 Tax Reform Act.    In the first nine months of this year, municipal new-issue volume fell 30% to $77.7 billion from $111.7 billion a year earlier, according to Securities Data.    Rumors persist that nearly every major Wall Street municipal operation faces cutbacks. Streamlinings, firings and large-scale transfers have already occurred in the public finance departments at American Express Co.'s Shearson unit and units of Miller andamp; Schroeder Inc. and Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., among other firms.    A public finance official at a major Wall Street firm said of Salomon's decision, &quot;You wonder what they know that you don't know.&quot;    Salomon's plan to phase out its municipal bond business isn't apt to have any direct impact on individual investors because Salomon sold solely to institutions. But the move is likely to have a &quot;chilling effect&quot; in the overall market, said Linda Rosenberg, a municipal trader for the Philadelphia securities firm Butcher andamp; Singer Inc., a unit of Butcher andamp; Co.    &quot;Salomon provided a lot of liquidity,&quot; said Ms. Rosenberg. And &quot;everybody was always asking, 'What's Solly doing?'&quot;    In thin trading on the Columbus Day holiday yesterday, municipal bond prices were down only slightly. But in the more active futures market for tax-exempts, prices fell sharply, outpacing declines in the futures trading for government securities.    Robert Boyden Lamb, a professor at New York University's Graduate School of Business and author of several books on municipal bonds said he was &quot;flabbergasted&quot; to hear Salomon is abandoning municipals. While public finance is going through a &quot;very difficult period,&quot; he termed the firm's decision to pull out &quot;shortsighted.&quot;    &quot;There is between $2 trillion and $3 trillion of municipal financing that will inevitably be financed with some form of municipal securities over the next 20 years,&quot; Prof. Lamb said. &quot;For Salomon Brothers to abandon the field leads me to believe they haven't thought through the long-term strategy for the firm as a whole.&quot;    In fact, Salomon's decision grew out of a strategic review initiated this summer to find ways to halt the slide of the firm's earnings and stock price. Yesterday John H. Gutfreund, Salomon's chairman, described municipal bonds as &quot;a very large market,&quot; and said he thinks &quot;it is a very interesting business.&quot; He added, however, &quot;It has an important retail component to it which we do not have.&quot;    In the first nine months of this year, Salomon Brothers, a unit of Salomon Inc. acted as lead manager on 77 issues totaling $7.5 billion, according to Securities Data. But that was sharply below the 97 issues totaling $9.9 billion that Salomon brought to market in the year-earlier period.    The decreased profitability of the municipal bond underwriting business is chiefly a result of restrictions in the tax law that curb the sale of municipal bonds while reducing the tax advantages of purchasing them. The law imposes a state-by-state volume cap on municipal bond issuance, cutting new business. And Salomon, a firm that marketed municipals to institutions, was particularly hard hit by the tax law's move to lessen the tax advantages to banks and insurance companies of holding municipals.    One former municipal bond client of Salomon's, MONY Financial Services Inc., parent of Mutual Life Insurance Co. of New York, illustrates the reduced demand. Three years ago, MONY allocated about 3% of its then $11 billion in assets to municipals, said Floyd L. Smith, executive vice president, investments. Now, while the firm continues to do much business with Salomon in other areas, the tax law and other federal legislation affecting the insurance industry has decreased the attractiveness of municipals so much that the firm has nearly no municipal holdings in its $20 billion portfolio.    The tax law and rising interest rates have &quot;made for difficult times for many firms,&quot; and the profitability of public finance underwriting has eroded sharply, said Richard Ciccarone, senior analyst of Van Kampen Merritt Inc., a Naperville, Ill., securities firm.    In one study of 1,300 municipal issues sold since 1981, Van Kampen found that the average underwriting fees paid fell from 2.9% of the total issue in 1982 to 1.9% in the first quarter of 1987. On a bond issue of $50 million, for example, this decline cuts the fees earned from $1.5 million to $950,000.    The changes spawned by tax revision have also made for greater volatility -- a point driven home to municipal bond market participants in April and early May, when municipals prices fell almost 13 points, or nearly $650 for each $5,000 face value of debt. Salomon was one of a number of firms, market sources said, that recorded hefty losses in the episode.    ---                    Municipal Market Share    Underwritings of tax-exempt securities, in percent ofdollar amount issued* FIRM                         1987     1986     1985 Salomon Brothers             9.9%     9.3%     5.7% Smith Barney                 7.6      5.3      6.6 Merrill Lynch                7.5      9.5     10.5 First Boston                 6.7      4.5      6.0 Goldman Sachs                6.4      8.3     10.1 PaineWebber                  4.8      3.0      4.2 Shearson Lehman Brothers     3.3      6.1      4.6 Prudential-Bache             3.0      3.2      2.3 E.F.
