About 30 family members of imprisoned dissidents gathered infront of the Blue House, the presidential residence, demanding aninterview with President Roh Tae-woo.   Riot police took away the protesters, who shoutedanti-government slogans and tried to march into the residence.   At Seoul National University, about 200 students called for therelease of political prisoners and denounced a recent governmentamnesty as insufficient.   The government released about 130 political prisoners lastSaturday, saying only dissidents guilty of violent crimes orsubversion remained in prison.   The Joong-ang Ilbo, an influential Seoul newspaper, said thefreed dissidents are under surveillance and that their dailyactivities were reported to security authorities.   Also today, the governing and opposition parties resolved theirdifferences over electoral rules and other issues, clearing the wayfor National Assembly elections expected in mid-April.   In addition, senior officials of the two main oppositionparties, controlled by Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, agreed onbasic rules for their merger before the balloting.   In December's presidential election, the two Kims split theopposition vote. Roh won with 36.6 percent of the vote.   The officials said after a three-hour meeting that they wouldpropose the elections be held under a system picking one lawmakerinstead of two in each district.   The governing Democratic Justice Party welcomed the oppositionproposal.   The governing party, which had favored a system electing one tothree members in each district depending on the size of population,changed its position today on the order of the president.   Before today's meeting, the opposition camp was itself dividedover the election formula, forcing a delay in adopting the new lawsneeded before balloting can be held.   The proposed reform would increase the overall number oflegislators from 271 to 300 by increasing the number of districts.</TEXT></DOC>
