The owners, who will divide most of the $150 million the leaguewill receive in expansion fees from the Sharks, Tampa Bay Lightning and OttawaSenators (the last two join the NHL for the 1992-93 season), say that about 53percent of the league's revenues are paid to the players in salary. Thesalaries have increased dramatically in the past two seasons, and the ownerssay they can't keep up with the increases because the league has no networktelevision contract in the United States. Thus, they don't want to loosenfree-agency rules. But the players say the league's free-agency system is toorestricted. They say teams are afraid to sign top-flight free agents becausethe compensation requirements are too severe. For evidence, the players pointto the recent ruling that forces the St. Louis Blues to send All-Stardefenseman Scott Stevens to the New Jersey Devils as compensation for signingfree-agent forward Brendan Shanahan.;   Q Are team owners considering alockout if there is no agreement by Sunday?;   A Not according to DeanLombardi, Sharks assistant general manager. &quot;That would be a bad publicrelations decision,&quot; Lombardi said.;   Q If players don't strike right away,what date might they set for a settlement deadline?;   A According to Wilson,that's something the players haven't talked about.;   Q How many negotiatingsessions have taken place, and how much progress has been made?;   A Becausethey spent the off-season bickering, the sides met only three times during thesummer and made limited progress. The sides are trying to schedule meetingsthis week.;   Q Who are the power brokers in these negotiations?;   A NHLPresident John Ziegler and board chairman Bill Wirtz, who owns the ChicagoBlackhawks, are the primary negotiators for the league. The players are beingrepresented by Bob Goodenow, deputy executive director of the NHLPA. Goodenowis taking over for lame-duck union chief Alan Eagleson and is expected todrive a harder bargain than Eagleson, who had a reputation for being cozy withthe owners.;   Q Are all NHL players members of the players association?;   AYes. Players in the minors are not part of the union, but are signed to NHLcontracts and automatically become union members if they are called up.;   QIf the players strike, would owners consider using replacement players, as theNFL did in 1987?;   A Probably not, because the minor league players wouldbecome union members if they were called up.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MIKE WEAVER, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910911  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1F  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  598  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, September 11, 199100255468,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
