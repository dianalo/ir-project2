Court sources said Monday that the results of the two-monthinvestigation have been given to Ugo Giudiceandrea, the chiefprosecutor in Rome, who will decide whether to file charges.   Police said the charges under consideration include extortionand fraud.   Police sources in this gambling resort along the Italian Rivieraindicated that little-known singers and their recording companiespaid bribes ranging from $42,500 to $85,000 to appear in thecontest.   The show can boost a singer's popularity and royalties becauseit is telecast nationally on the state-controlled network for threestraight nights.   The Italian media has identified a few singers and somecompanies that have contended they paid bribes, but police have notconfirmed the reports.   The news reports said several singers began irate protests andfiled suits after they said they paid bribes and were entered inthe contest but never appeared on television.   A jury named by the private organization that runs the contestselected songs and singers for the 39th edition of the festival inFebruary.   Adriano Aragozzini, who headed the organization, was quoted byMilan's daily Corriere della Sera as saying ``I'm not involved inthe scandal. If someone got the money for entering singers in thecompetition he's was not part of my party.''   Teddy Reno, the manager-husband of Italian singer Rita Pavone,said ``it has long been a practice in San Remo to select singers onthe basis of many reasons but artistic quality.''   He added, however, that he was not asked for any money to havehis wife selected for this year's contest. Pavone's song waseliminated by the jury.   The most popular Italian pop singers such as Jovanotti, AnnaOxa, Fausto Leali, Albano and his American wife Romina Power,competed in the contest, which also had separate sections foremerging and new artists.</TEXT></DOC>
