(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A military technician who was worriedabout the safety of a $4,500 infrared light tester used onhelicopters went to the local hardware store and built his own _ for$8.75.   Now, after saving the military more than $6 million a year, JohnLedoux is getting his reward: a check for $25,000.   Ledoux, a part-time sergeant in the Vermont Army National Guardand a full-time civilian employee of an Army National Guard base inBurlington, Vt., received a $10,000 incentive prize from thegovernment more than a year ago.   Today he was to receive the larger prize from the federal Officeof Personnel Management.   ``I'm just kind of glad I'm finally getting the monetary award.It seems like it's a long time coming,'' said Ledoux, who explainedthat bureaucratic errors delayed the check.   ``I feel like it's been put off for so long it's lost its glow,''he said. ``But I'm glad things are finally coming to a head.''   The award is the maximum allowed by law and the largest given toa federal employee, said Joseph Jamele, press secretary for Sen.Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. He said only 20 such awards have ever beengranted.   Ledoux, 33 and father of five, said the money would come in handy.   ``My wife and I have a big family so, of course, the money isnice,'' he said.   Ledoux said he developed his hand-held device in 1986 afterwatching engineers with the Lockheed Aircraft Corp. install infraredlights on helicopters using the standard-issue testing device, whichwas built into a pair of goggles.   Ledoux said the engineers often perched in precarious positionson the helicopters to test the lights. Concerned for their safety,he went down to a local electronics store and picked up aphototransistor, a light-emitting diode, a switch and a nine-voltbattery. After fiddling around with the parts for a couple of days,he put the device together.   He said it took the Army a bit longer to realize the potentialsavings. First he sent a diagram of the device, but it was onlyafter he sent the device itself that the Army congratulated him onhis ingenuity.   Army officials are crediting the device with saving 987,000 hoursof labor a year, for a total of $6.85 million. They estimate netsavings of $6.3 million after subtracting the costs of materials andof implementing the device.   Jamele said Ledoux's buddies in the National Guard now call him``the $6 million man.''</TEXT></DOC>
