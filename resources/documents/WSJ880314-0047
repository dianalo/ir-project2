The pilot, Steven Silver, died in the crash, as did the co-pilot and seven passengers. This is the first time that a pilot of a commercial, scheduled carrier tested positive in post-accident drug screening.    The safety board's investigation of the accident, which occurred Jan. 19, will continue for several months. The board hasn't yet determined what caused the accident or whether the drug use played a role.    The disclosure comes just days after the Transportation Department proposed requiring airline pilots, flight attendants and maintenance workers to undergo random and other kinds of drug testing. The proposal was bitterly denounced by the pilots' union, which said there is no evidence that pilots are using drugs.    The flight was operated by Trans Colorado Airlines, which has a marketing agreement with Continental Airlines, a unit of Texas Air Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
