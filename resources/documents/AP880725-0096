The official, who asked not to be identified, said he had nodetails on the talks, being held in Vietnam's capital of Hanoi andexpected to last four days.   Vietnam on July 13 returned 25 remains it identified as those ofU.S. servicemen killed in the war. Hanoi also handed over a list ofnames and ``associations'' relating to the remains. Some of thenames appear on the official list of 1,761 Americans who remainmissing in action from the war.   The turnover was the fifth since retired Gen. John W. Vessey,acting as a special presidential envoy, reached an agreement inHanoi a year ago under which Vietnam would accelerate the searchfor remains, especially several dozen on Washington's top prioritylist.   This week's talks were agreed upon during a meeting at theUntied Nations on June 8 between Vessey and Vietnamese ForeignMinister Nguyen Co Thach.   The U.S. technical team was led by Lt. Col. Joe Harvey of theU.S. Embassy's Joint Casualty Resolution Center and joined byrepresentatives from the U.S. Army Central IdentificationLaboratory based in Hawaii, the official said.   ``We look forward to the results of the July 25-28 meetingbetween technical representatives. We hope progress can be madequickly on resolving this longstanding problem of concern to thePOW-MIA families of U.S and American people,'' the official quotedU.S. State Department spokeswoman Phyllis Oakley as saying Thursdayin Washington.   Since the war ended, Vietnam has returned more than 150 sets ofremains that the army laboratory has confirmed as Americans.Vietnam says it has returned the remains of 241 missing Americansand information on 45 others whose remains were ``determined to beno longer in existence.''</TEXT></DOC>
