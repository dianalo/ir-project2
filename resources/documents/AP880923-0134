Less than two weeks after agreeing to a leveraged buyout led bythe investment firm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., Macmillan saidThursday it was withdrawing its support for the $85-a-share bid.   But at the same time, the publishing giant declined to take aposition on the competing $2.41 billion bid by British publisherRobert Maxwell.   The company said its board wanted to ``continue the auctionprocess'' that already has driven its stock price up by about 70percent since mid-May.   In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Macmillanstock rose 50 cents a share to $86.87{ on Thursday.   The Kohlberg Kravis bid included cash and securities, whileMaxwell has said he would pay $86.80 in cash for each ofMacmillan's 27.8 million shares.   Macmillan said Thursday its board voted to withdraw itsrecommendation that shareholders accept the Kohlberg Kravis bid.But it said Kohlberg Kravis had told Macmillan it might amend itsoffer.   Macmillan's board decided to take no position immediately onMaxwell's offer ``in light of the board's determination to continuethe auction process.''   Macmillan said its board ``affirmed its willingness to considerthe Maxwell offer and any other offers that may be made by Maxwellor KKR or any other person and instructed its advisers to continueto seek to obtain maximum value for Macmillan's shareholders.''   A spokeswoman for Kohlberg Kravis said the firm had no comment.A spokesman for Maxwell said the British publisher had no commenton the announcement.   Financial analysts said a higher offer could appear, but theydisagreed over whether Kohlberg Kravis would drop out of thebidding.   Bert Boksen, a media analyst for the investment firm RaymondJames Financial Corp. in St. Petersburg, Fla., said the actionshowed the Macmillan board was offering the company to the highestbidder.   ``It appears like KKR is not going to increase their bid, and ifsomebody can come up with a better bid than Mr. Maxwell's, theywill get the company,'' Boksen said.   Boksen, who previously estimated Macmillan's worth at about $90a share, said there still was a chance someone could top Maxwell'sbid.   Bruce Thorp, media analyst for Provident National Bank inPhiladelphia, said he thought Kohlberg Kravis was inclined to raiseits offer, and could do so by including more securities, whichwould complicate comparison of the bid with Maxwell's all-cashoffer. He said a third party may also emerge.   Macmillan, which has interests that include book publishing andinformation services and the Berlitz language and Katherine Gibbssecretarial schools, has been a takeover target since mid-May whenTexas financier Robert M. Bass proposed a buyout at $64 a share, apremium over its price at the time of about $51 a share.   The company proposed a complicated restructuring in late Maythat included splitting the company into two separate companies _publishing and information services _ and giving shareholders astake in each along with a cash dividend.   The Bass Group blocked the restructuring plan by going to courtand subsequently raised its offer for the company to $75 a sharebefore dropping out of the bidding.   Maxwell, who has extensive media interests in Britain and is oneof the largest U.S. magazine printers, entered the fray in Julywith an $80-a-share offer, boosting it to $86.80 a week ago.   Maxwell has said he would be willing to drop his bid if he wereallowed to purchase certain Macmillan information services unitsfor $1.4 billion.</TEXT></DOC>
