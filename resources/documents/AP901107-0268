Nosair, whose condition improved from serious to fair Wednesday,was described by many acquaintances as a man who kept to himself.But New York Newsday reported one former employer fired him partlybecause his efforts to convert fellow workers to Islam interferedwith his work.   Nosair, 34, of Cliffside Park, N.J., was shot by a U.S. postalpolice officer after he allegedly killed Kahane, an anti-Arab,ultraright-wing Zionist, Monday night.   Nosair was charged with murder, attempted murder, assault,unlawful imprisonment, and criminal possession of a weapon and of adefaced weapon. The murder weapon, a .357 Magnum revolver, had itsidentification numbers filed off.   Newsday cited sources it did not identify as saying Nosair hadno arrest record and neither the FBI nor the CIA had heard of himbefore Kahane was shot.   Tuesday, FBI agents and police removed a file cabinet, severalboxes and a target drawn on white plasterboard from Nosair's home.   Records in this country showed Nosair was born in Port Said,Egypt, on Nov. 16, 1955, and graduated from a college in Cairo,where he studied industrial engineering.   However, Gen. Ahmed Zaatar, an assistant to the interiorminister of Egypt, said Wednesday that government records in PortSaid showed no record of a man born there with that name, orspellings close to it.   Immigration records indicate Nosair entered the United Statesthrough New York on a visitor's visa July 14, 1981; married a U.S.citizen, Caren Ann Mills, in 1982; became a permanent resident ofPittsburgh in 1983 and became a naturalized citizen in September1989.   The New York Post said Nosair met the woman he married at aPittsburgh mosque. Newsday said they met while taking night classesat a university there.   Nosair's first job in Pittsburgh was as a diamond setter at St.Clair's Jewelers.   ``He came here as a very naive, very nice young man from aforeign country,'' said Barbara Ausman, his supervisor. ``And hehad a very high opinion of himself.''   His goal, she told Newsday, was to get rich and return to Egypt.   Ausman said Nosair had tremendous national pride as an Egyptianand seemed reluctant to adjust to American customs.   Ausman said Nosair was fired from the jewelry store in 1983.   ``We dismissed him for two reasons: in part because of his lackof ability to develop his skills,'' she said. ``But also because hewould consistently try to convert people to his way of religion.''   In 1986, Nosair moved to Jersey City, N.J.   Debra Ragab, 39, superintendent of a Jersey City apartmentcomplex where the family had lived, said the murder charge was ``asurprise to us, to everybody,'' including Mrs. Nosair.   The Nosairs moved to Cliffside Park about a year ago with theirdaughter, Nora, 11, and two sons, Abdul Aziz, 7, and Abdul Rahman,5.   Nosair used a relative's New York City address, however, toobtain a city job in April 1988 as a heating and air conditioningrepairman.</TEXT></DOC>
