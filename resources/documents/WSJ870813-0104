MitchellStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/13/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ENVIRONMENT (ENV)CONSTRUCTION, MATERIALS (CON) </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   National Gypsum Inc., one of the nation's biggest defendants of asbestos-related property damage claims, said it settled for $8.4 million a large portion of the lawsuits filed by school districts.    National Gypsum, which faces thousands of claims from both private and public building owners, said this is the first time it has settled an asbestos-related property damage suit. The settlement covers claims of 155 school districts in 19 states, which had sued to have asbestos ceilings removed from their buildings. National Gypsum said it previously had set aside reserves to cover claims and that the settlement wouldn't affect its earnings.    The company added that 25 other schools and school districts have agreed to pursue their claims through class-action litigation pending in Philadelphia federal court against 53 former miners, manufacturers and suppliers of asbestos building materials. The litigation was filed on behalf of 14,000 school districts nationwide.    The settlement involves claims by schools represented by Daniel A. Speights, a partner in Blatt andamp; Fales, a South Carolina law firm that is handling many asbestos litigation cases for schools.    Although some public building owners have won multimillion-dollar judgments in the past 18 months against National Gypsum and other asbestos makers, Mr. Speights said the amount of the settlement reflected the fact that less than a third of the 155 districts had buildings containing National Gypsum products.    The affected districts' claims were all for less than $500,000 each. Those districts, he said, were receiving more than 50 cents on the dollar for their claims. &quot;While it might appear the number is relatively small, in effect the school districts who have National Gypsum products have reached a substantial settlement,&quot; Mr. Speights said.    Damage cases involving buildings in which asbestos-related products were used have been filed mainly against National Gypsum, W.R. Grace andamp; Co., New York, and Chicago-based USG Corp. It is understood that W.R. Grace may be near a settlement of many of its pending school district claims.    In addition to the massive class-action school district lawsuit in Philadelphia, thousands of claims have been filed by colleges, hospitals and private building owners, as well as by state and local governments for the removing the material.    Most buildings erected before 1970 used fireproofing materials involving asbestos, a mineral that causes deadly lung diseases and cancers that often don't show up for years. However, building materials that include asbestos aren't considered a health threat unless they have been disturbed. </TEXT></DOC>
