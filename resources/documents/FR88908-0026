This regulation requires the Commonwealth of Massachusetts Departmentof Environmental Quality Engineering (DEQE) to determine and impose RACTon all stationary sources with the potential to emit one hundred tons peryear (TPY) or more of VOCs that are not already subject to RACT under Massachusetts'regulations developed pursuant to the EPA Control Techniques Guideline(CTG) documents. In a November 17, 1982 letter to EPA, the DEQE committedto submit each of the individual RACT determinations to EPA for incorporationinto the Massachusetts SIP. On November 9, 1983, EPA codified at 40 CFR52.1123 that the DEQE must submit each RACT determination made under 310CMR 7.18(17) to EPA as a SIP revision in order to incorporate the limitationsinto the SIP. EPA's rationale for requiring the DEQE to submit each RACTdetermination as a single source SIP revision is that emission limits andreduction measures imposed by states on existing stationary sources innonattainment areas do not constitute RACT unless and until EPA approvesthem as RACT via rulemaking.Starcraft Sailboat Products, Inc. in Fall River, Massachusetts is a non-CTGVOC source subject to RACT under Massachusetts' Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17).On March 25 and June 30, 1987, EPA received a proposed SIP revision fromthe Massachusetts DEQE. This revision includes the DEQE's proposed PlanApproval, State Order SM-85-171-IF, issued under 310 CMR 7.18(17) to Starcrafton October 14, 1986. This proposed Plan Approval imposes RACT for Starcraft'snon-CTG processes and specifies a January 1, 1986 compliance date. Althoughthe proposed Plan Approval issued by the DEQE is currently fully enforceableby that agency under State law, the formal SIP revision submitted by theDEQE to EPA must consist of the Plan Approval amended as specified by thisnotice before EPA will undertake final rulemaking approving it as RACTand incorporating it into the SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Summary of RACT Determination</ITAG>Starcraft has three production processes that emit VOCs at its Fall Riverfacility. The three production processes are fiberglass boat fabrication,clean-up operations, and miscellaneous operations. The fiberglass boatfabrication and clean-up operations are the two major sources of VOC emissions.The miscellaneous operations, on the contrary, emit very small amountsof VOCs such that their overall contribution to total plantwide emissionsis considered negligible (approximately one TPY in relation to total plant-wideemissions of 344 TPY). As stated above, on March 25 and June 30, 1987,the DEQE submitted State Order SM-85-171-IF as a proposed Plan Approvalfor Starcraft. That proposed Plan Approval imposes requirements on Starcraftwhich the DEQE has determined to constitute RACT to reduce VOC emissions.The requirements of the proposed Plan Approval are summarized below:Work Practicesa. Starcraft is required to reduce the number of containers of miscellaneouscleaning solvent (acetone) used and to allocate them to specific work areas.b. Starcraft is required to utilize cleaning solvent containers with lidsto prevent evaporation when not in use.c. Starcraft is required to restrict the allocation of the cleaning solventand to track its use with accounting logs and usage balance sheets.d. Starcraft is required to perform daily maintenance on its resin andgel coating equipment.e. Starcraft is required to reuse some spent cleaning solvent for equipmentcleaning versus using virgin solvent.f. Starcraft is required to train its employees with an emphasis on acceptablelaminating (lay-up) techniques and procedures.g. Starcraft is required to adopt management policies which encourage employesto suggest ideas and methods to reduce VOC emission through improved manufacturingtechniques and/or cleaning solvent substitutions.h. Starcraft is required to make gloves available for employee hand protectionthereby reducing the use of solvent for hand cleaning between resin applications.Solvent ReclamationStarcraft is required to recover on-site spent cleaning solvent (acetone)through distillation.Styrene Suppressed ResinsStarcraft is required to use suppressed as opposed to nonsuppressed laminatingresins thereby achieving emission reductions of styrene from laminatingoperatings.Cleaning Solvent SubstitutionsStarcraft is required to continue research into the use of reduced or non-VOCcleaning materials for certain applications. As a result of these VOC emission reduction measures (excluding the reductionassociated with the use of styrene suppressed resin) imposed in the proposedPlan Approval, Starcraft will achieve a plantwide emission reduction ofapproximately 22 percent, when 1979 baseline emission levels are comparedwith emission levels after control (RACT). The VOC emission reduction resultingfrom the Starcraft's use of the styrene suppressed resin versus nonsuppressedwas not accounted for in calculating the 22 percent reduction due to theimplementation of RACT as Starcraft has been using this type of laminatingresin since prior to the 1979 baseline year.In addition to the above individual VOC emission reduction measures whichthe DEQE has determined to constitute RACT, the proposed Plan Approvalalso requires Starcraft to meet the emission rates expressed in poundsof VOC emitted per unit boat model produced. These emission rates are imposedas additional requirements on Starcraft to assure that the VOC emissionreductions resulting from the continuous compliance with the RACT measuresas stated above are permanent. The final compliance date contained in theproposed Plan Approval is January 1, 1986. These emission rates are specifiedin the proposed Plan Approval for each of Starcraft's twelve boat modelsas shown below:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,i1,s25,8.2</C><T4>RACT Emission Rates (Pounds VOC/Unit Boat Model Produced)</T4><H1>Boat model</H1><H1>Pounds VOC per unit boat model</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Widgeon <D>64.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">J <D>73.03</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Day Sailer <D>82.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">192 <D>130.16</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">222 <D>139.00</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">272 <D>204.54</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">32 <D>336.72</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">35 <D>400.74</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">40 <D>470.76</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">c-22 <D>147.41</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">c-28 <D>286.04</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">c-33 <D>380.90</D></ITAG></ITAG>Whether Starcraft is complying with the above emission limitations willbe determined in accordance with records of VOC usage which it is requiredto maintain. In order to assure that Starcraft is adhering to the emissionrates for each boat model that is produced, Starcraft is required to maintainand update daily records of material usage and VOC release to the ambientair, and of the weekly number of boats molded. The log must include dailyusage of (a) gelcoat, (b) laminating resin, and (c) cleaning solvent.In addition, Starcraft is required to track and report annually to theDEQE small usage items which emit VOCs but in a very small amount (approximatelyone ton per year).EPA has reviewed the proposed Plan Approval and supporting documents submittedas a SIP revision for parallel-processing and generally concurs witht theDEQE's RACT determination. For more details on EPA's review and justificationof Starcraft's RACT determination, see the Technical Support Document availableat the EPA Regional Office listed in the <T2>ADDRESSES </T2>section of this notice. However, the proposed Plan Approvalitself must be amended as explained below before EPA will conduct finalrulemaking to approve and incorporate it into the SIP.The proposed Plan Approval specifies various VOC emission reduction measures(summarized above) in the areas of work practices, solvent reclamation,styrene suppressed resins, and cleaning solvent substitution for fiberglassboat fabrication, clean-up operations, and miscellaneous operations. TheseRACT requirements, as currently written in the proposed Plan Approval,in general are not clearly enforceable and the emission reductions calculatedto result from their implementation, therefore, may not occur.EPA is proposing to approve the Commonwealth of Massachusetts' proposedPlan Approval (ORDER SM-85-171-IF) as RACT for Starcraft. However, beforeEPA will conduct final rulemaking approving this Plan Approval as a SIPrevision, the DEQE must add the requirements listed below to clarify theRACT emission reduction measures and to make them more enforceable. TheDEQE must also specify the final compliance date of January 1, 1986 forthe following requirements.Regulation 310 CMR 7.18(17) requires subject stationary sources to demonstratecompliance with RACT as expeditiously as practicable no later than December31, 1986.Work Practices(1) The final Plan Approval must contain a requirement that all employeeswear gloves when contacting laminating resins.(2) The final Plan Approval must specify that all cleaning solvent containers'lids are closed at all times except when an item is being entered intoor removed.Solvent ReclamationThe final Plan Approval must require Starcraft to operate its in-housesolvent recovery system which is used to reclaim waste organic clearingsolvent, and must include specific operating requirements for the solventrecovery system. First, the final Plan Approval must specify a maximumweight percentage of VOC content to be met on a continuous basis for thesolvent recovery system's residues. This maximum VOC content by weightshould be initially established using the solvent recovery system's designspecifications and the reduction in VOC emissions accounted for duringRACT implementation. In addition, the final Plan Approval must also specify,at minimum, one of the following limitations for the solvent recovery systemin accordance with its design specifications: (1) A maximum concentrationof outlet VOCs from the condensor's vent (i.e., in parts per million byvolume of VOCs) not to be exceeded, (2) a maximum temperature of the condensor'svent not to be exceeded, or (3) a maximum temperature of the condensor'scoolant not to be exceeded. This will assure that the solvent recoverysystem is operating as intended and designed. Finally, the Plan Approvalmust require that the waste organic cleaning solvent (before being recovered)and the solvent recovery system's residues (before being sent out as awaste product) must be stored in closed containers to prevent evaporation.Fiberglass FabricationThe final Plan Approval must specify a maximum styrene monomer contentto be met on a continuous basis for the gelcoat resins and styrene suppressedlaminating resins, and require Starcraft to use only these two types ofgelcoat and styrene suppressed laminating resins. In addition, the finalPlan Approval must specify a maximum VOC content for the resin catalystused and a maximum feed ratio of gelcoat catalyst to fiberglass resin forthe application equipment. The Plan Approval must require that these emissionlimitations be met on a continuous basis.Cleaning Solvent SubstitutionsThe final Plan Approval must specify what portion of the solvent cleaning,e.g., of brushes, rollers, spray guns, hands, etc. is done with the newlyintroduced VOC-reducted or non-VOC cleaning solvent. The final Plan Approvalmust require Starcraft to use only this water-based cleaning solvent indesignated areas where reduction in VOC emissions from its use were accountedfor during RACT implementation. In addition, the final Plan Approval mustspecify for each cleaning solvent: the name, an emission rate in poundsof VOC per gallon of cleaning solvent to be met on a continuous basis,designated area(s) for its application, and a daily maximum consumptionin gallons of VOC per day.Once EPA approves the Plan Approval, any amendment to it must be submittedby the DEQE as a SIP revision.Today's ActionIn order for EPA to take final action approving the DEQE's Plan Approvalfor Starcraft, that Plan Approval must be amended to include the requirementsoutlined in this notice. The Plan Approval must specify the final compliancedate of January 1, 1986 for all of its requirements.If the DEQE's final Plan Approval does not incorporate the requirementsoutlined in this notice to clearly define Starcraft's RACT VOC emissionreduction measures and insure their enforceability, EPA will withdraw thisproposed action to approve it and publish an action proposing to disapproveStarcraft's Plan Approval.EPA is soliciting public comments on issues discussed in this notice. Thesecomments will be considered before taking final action. Interested partiesmay participate in the Federal rulemaking procedure by submitting writtencomments to the address above.This revision is being proposed under a procedure called ``parallel processing''(47 FR 27073). If the proposed revision is substantially changed, in areasother than those required in this notice, EPA will evaluate those changesand may publish a revised NPR. If no substantial changes are made otherthan those areas cited in this notice, EPA will publish a Final RulemakingNotice on the revision. The final rulemaking action by EPA will occur onlyafter the final Plan Approval for Starcraft has been issued by the DEQEand has been formally submitted to EPA for incorporation into the SIP.<ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Action</ITAG>EPA is proposing to approve Commonwealth of Massachusetts' ORDER SM-85-171-IF,a proposed Plan Approval, as a revision to the Massachusetts SIP with theunderstanding that the DEQE will revise the proposed Plan Approval as outlinedin this notice prior to its formal submittal to EPA for incorporation intothe SIP.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709.)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.The Administrator's decision to approve or disapprove the SIP revisionwill be based on whether it meets the requirements of sections 110(a)(2)(A)-(K)and 110(a)(3) of the Clean Air Act, as amended, and EPA regulations in40 CFR Part 51.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Ozone, Hydrocarbons, Intergovernmental relations,Reporting and recordkeeping requirements.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority:</T4> 42 U.S.C. 7401-7642.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: December 22, 1987.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Michael R.
