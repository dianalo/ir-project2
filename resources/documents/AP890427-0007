Turner noticed what he throught was a stray thread on thesurgical drapes. Then it wiggled.   The thread was actually a 2-inch-long skinny red worm slitheringout of the patient's incision. It was a fish worm, inadvertentlyeaten by the patient in sushi the night before.   The patient was undergoing the operation for abdominal pain, butdoctors believe the worm was the real cause of his misery.   The incident, described in today's New England Journal ofMedicine, ``is an uncomfortable reminder of the potential danger ofeating raw fish,'' noted Dr. Peter M. Schantz of the U.S. Centersfor Disease Control in Atlanta.   Raw fish in sushi and sashimi has become popular with the spreadof Japanese restaurants in the United States, but health expertssay most cases of worm infection occur when people prepare raw fishat home. Experienced sushi chefs are good at spotting wormy fish soit doesn't reach customers.   In the latest case, the victim ate raw fish at a friend's homein New York City.   ``He looked like anybody else with appendicitis,'' recalledTurner, a surgeon at Booth Memorial Hospital. ``I operated, andmuch to my chagrin the appendix was normal. I was getting ready toclose the abdomen, and I see this little thing, and it looks likeit's moving.   ``I said, `Wait a minute. There's something wrong. I'll bedamned. It's a worm.'''   The astonished doctors sent the worm to Albert Einstein Collegeof Medicine, where it was identified as a larval nematode known aseustrongylides.   ``There is a clear danger involved in eating raw fish. Thisunderscores that danger,'' said Dr. Murray Wittner, an Einsteinparasitologist.   The adult form of eustrongylides is a parasite of fish-eatingbirds, while the larvae are found in the flesh of fish that live inbrackish and fresh water.   In an editorial in the journal, Schantz noted that only fourother cases of human infection with a nematode have been reported.All were fishermen who swallowed bait minnows whole _ ``a practicenot likely to be widely imitated.''   The worms most commonly acquired from raw seafood are larvae ofthe family Anisakidae. Between 25 and 50 U.S. cases have beendocumented, but experts believe most cases are not recognized orreported to health officials.   The worms often pass harmlessly through the digestive system orare coughed up a few hours after the meal. Doctors have evendescribed a condition known as ``tingling throat syndrome,'' whichoccurs when the worms get stuck in the back of the throat.   Sometimes, however, the worms burrow into the wall of thestomach or the intestines. They must be removed with a tube that'spushed down the victim's throat.   Schantz noted that many commercial fish are commonly infectedwith worms. These include mackerel, herring, rockfish, salmon andcod. The parasites also are more common in fish from the PacificOcean than from the Atlantic.   The number of worm infections is increasing in the UnitedStates. But Schantz doubts that this will ever become a majorhealth problem, since most Americans still prefer their fishcooked, which kills the worms.</TEXT></DOC>
