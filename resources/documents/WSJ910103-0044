Of the 45 institutions that were seized by Rhode Island onNew Year's Day, 35 were identified by the state as creditunions. The crisis was caused when a Providence-based privateinsurance company became overwhelmed by losses of its members-- and the prospect of even larger losses to come.</LP><TEXT>   One in 10 of the nation's credit unions aren't federallyinsured, which frees them to operate under a potpourri ofstate regulations that often are loosely enforced. These1,462 institutions, representing $20.8 billion in assets,also enjoy lower costs in the form of cheaper insurancepremiums and less-burdensome regulatory requirements. But theability to operate largely outside federal regulatorystrictures also allows them to more freely invest in realestate, for example -- one of the first sectors of theeconomy to feel the current economic slump.   &quot;State regulations vary widely, and many of them allowcredit unions to get into commercial and real estate lendingthat federal regulations prohibit,&quot; said Jerry Karbon, aspokesman for the Credit Union National Association, whichrepresents 92% of the nation's credit unions. &quot;It's allowedthe Rhode Island credit unions and many others in New Englandto get into higher risk areas and, eventually, into trouble.&quot;   Said a top federal regulator familiar with the RhodeIsland situation: &quot;What private insurance offers is a tacitarrangement that keeps these institutions out from under thefederal regulatory umbrella and provides them with broadpowers and lax regulation.&quot;   In a letter sent to Rhode Island Gov. Bruce G. Sundlun twohours after his inauguration, Rhode Island Share andamp; DepositIndemnity Corp. said it faced &quot;extraordinary liquiditydemands&quot; from some of its members in recent days. Gov.Sundlun ordered that the insurer be taken over, leaving 45institutions with a total of $1.7 billion in 300,000 depositaccounts unable to operate because they were uninsured.   Because state law prohibits banks or credit unions fromoperating without some kind of insurance, state officialsbegan frantic negotiations to get coverage from the NationalCredit Union Share Insurance Fund -- the federal agency thatregulates and insures credit unions -- for the closedinstitutions, including 35 credit unions.   Late yesterday, state officials said they had obtainedfederal insurance for seven credit unions -- representingless than $200 million in assets -- allowing them to opennext Monday. The officials said some depositors could haveaccounts frozen for months in credit unions and banks thatcan't get federal insurance. Federal officials yesterdaynoted that acceptance is far from automatic, becauseregulators require these institutions to hold 4.5% capital asa percentage of assets to be accepted for federal insurance.Many of the Rhode Island credit unions have levels below thatand would need capital, possibly supplied by the state, toqualify.   The most recent widespread failure of private insurersoccurred in 1985, when the governors of Maryland and Ohioclosed scores of privately insured savings and loans. InMaryland, where then Gov. Harry Hughes closed 102 savings andloans, some depositors weren't paid back deposits until 1989,after asset sales of the troubled institutions werecompleted.   While the Rhode Island closings were precipitated by thefailure in November of Heritage Loan andamp; Investment Co., a $25million bank whose closing drained at least $13 million fromthe now defunct private insurer, the deeper problem is poormanagement by the state's credit unions, according toregulators.   Looking over all the privately insured credit unions inRhode Island, John Rickmeier, of IDC Financial PublishingInc., a financial analysis firm based in Hartland, Wis.,notes that several of the largest credit unions have morethan 90% of their loans in commercial and residential realestate mortgages.   &quot;It's a scenario not dissimilar to the Sandamp;L crisis,&quot; saidMr. Rickmeier, explaining that Rhode Island credit unionsoften paid high rates to attract depositors, broadened beyondtheir member companies or organizations to whole communities,and then got involved in higher risk loans to put theirgrowing deposits to profitable work.   Mr. Rickmeier said the nation's credit unions tend todivide their loan portfolios evenly among personal loans,auto loans and real estate mortgage loans, and that the heavyreal estate loan concentrations in Rhode Island were madepossible by casually enforced state regulations. Mr. Karbon,of the National Credit Union Association, adds that stateexaminers hadn't visited Heritage Loan for three years andthat regulatory visits to credit unions have been similarlysporadic.   &quot;At this point, of course it doesn't sound like the RhodeIsland regulators were completely on top of things,&quot; saysChip Filson, spokesman for the National Association of ShareInsurance Associations, which represents the nation's 10private credit-union insurers. &quot;But before everybody condemnsthe state regulators too quickly, don't forget that some{federally} insured institutions, where billions have beenlost, have not been examined in years as well.&quot;   ---                       Money Worries                                                                                                          States ranked by assets of credit unions not insured bythe federal government                                                                                                                                     NO.
