The male offspring of these 3 irradiation groupsand 1 control group were tested for locomotor coordination on parallelbars and in a water maze. The female offspring were used in an operantconditioning test. The locomotor test showed slight impairment of locomotorcoordination in those animals irradiated with 0,9 Gy high dose rate.Swimming ability was significantly impaired by irradiation with 0,9 Gyhigh dose rate. Performance in the operant conditioning task was improvedby irradiation with 0,9 Gy both low and high dose rate. The 0,9 Gy highdose rate group learned faster than all the other groups. For the doseof 0,9 Gy a significant dose rate effect could be observed. For the doseof 0,6 Gy a similar tendency was observed, differences between 0,6 Gyhigh and low dose rate and controls not being significant.</TEXT></DOC>
