Robert Satiacum, the former chairman of the Puyallup Indiannation, who became a U.S. fugitive in 1982, sought sanctuary amonga Canadian Indian band, according to a spokeswoman for the band.   Satiacum, 60, was convicted Nov. 9 of fondling a 10-year-oldgirl. He was ordered deported to the United States to faceracketeering and other charges, but instead headed to the MountCurrie Indian reservation, about 100 miles northwest of Vancouver,Indian spokeswoman Lyn Compton said Friday.   Mark Hilford, who resigned Friday as Satiacum's lawyer, said theRoyal Canadian Mounted Police would seek to arrest Satiacum oncharges of failing to appear for sentencing on the sex charge.Satiacum probably would serve that sentence before being deported,officials said.   But Ms. Compton said the Mount Currie band was ``taking astand'' and refusing to surrender Satiacum to police.   ``He is a member of this nation. He has sought refuge, sanctuaryhere,'' Ms. Compton said. ``What people here are doing is standingby their sovereign rights, their traditional laws. They do notrecognize Canadian laws or the Canada-U.S. border.''   The Mount Currie Indians belong to the Coast-Salish ancestralgroup, which extends along the coast from Washington state tosouthwest Alaska and includes the Puyallups. The band adoptedSatiacum in 1987.   ``This has happened before,'' Ms. Compton said. ``Chief SittingBull sought sanctuary in the north. This is history repeatingitself.''   Satiacum has said he wouldn't be taken alive by authorities.   ``I don't want to see an armed confrontation,'' said JeffWilliamson, head of the inquiries and removal section of theCanadian Immigration Department. ``I don't want to see him in ashootout with police.''   In 1982, Satiacum fled Washington state, where he faced up to300 years in jail on charges including racketeering, embezzlement,arson and conspiracy to commit murder.   Two years ago he became the first U.S. citizen to be grantedpolitical refugee status in Canada, when an immigration tribunalfound he had a reasonable fear of persecution if returned to theUnited States.   In June the ruling was overturned by the Federal Court ofAppeal. Satiacum has been seeking an appeal with the Supreme Courtof Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
