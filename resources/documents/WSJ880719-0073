So, here it is: a ranking on aircraft maintenance.    The accompanying charts rate the ten largest U.S. airlines on how much of their operating budgets they spend on maintenance, as well as on the average number of mechanics they have for each plane. Although airlines cite some concerns about the figures -- they say differences in labor expenses, cost efficiency and the ages of the aircraft make comparisons difficult -- the measure is generally considered an important one within the industry.    &quot;Maintenance as a share of operating expenses shows level of commitment to maintenance as compared to other functions within a carrier,&quot; says David Swierenga, an assistant vice president of the Air Transport Association, an industry lobbying group.    Without the benefit of statistics such as these, air travelers haven't had much to go on when it comes to forming opinions on which airlines run a tight ship in aircraft maintenance. Many travelers assume the biggest carriers do the best job of maintaining their planes. Others try to stay away from airlines with publicized labor or financial problems, figuring that could cause problems. And some believe all airlines are pretty much alike when it comes to maintenance outlays.    But those beliefs aren't born out in the numbers. Big carriers such as United and American appear in the middle of the list. Troubled Eastern Airlines is No. 1 in maintenance spending. And there's a large margin between the top-ranked and bottom-ranked carriers.    Airlines' spending on maintenance is expected to come under further examination in the months ahead as the Federal Aviation Administration focuses more closely on what to do about the nation's aging aircraft fleet. At a conference last month on aging aircraft, the FAA said it will intensify its surveillance of how well airlines are maintaining their older planes. The average age of the carriers' domestic fleet currently is 12.1 years, compared with 10.3 in 1979. Moreover, 22% of the fleet is more than 20 years old and 41% is between 10 and 19 years old, according to Avmark Inc., an Arlington, Va.-based aviation consulting firm.    Overall, airlines today are spending a higher percentage of their budgets on maintenance than they were five years ago, based on an analysis of quarterly reports filed by airlines with the Department of Transportation. The increased spending stems partly from the fact that as planes age, they cost more to maintain. But it also reflects the increased wear and tear on planes during the past five years as airlines added flights and used planes more frequently to meet rising travel demand, Mr. Swierenga says.    Topping the list for maintenance spending in 1987 was loss-plagued Eastern, a unit of Texas Air Corp. and long a target of federal safety inquiries. Another Texas Air carrier, Continental Airlines, ranked third, just behind NWA Inc.'s Northwest.    Eastern's high ranking may reflect some steps taken because of the bad publicity it has received in recent years. In 1986, Eastern paid the FAA $9.5 million for safety violations, the largest fine ever assessed against an airline. And earlier this year, both Eastern and Continental were subject to federal scrutiny following complaints about unsafe practices; the government concluded that the two carriers were operating safely, but warned that Eastern's labor-management battles could lead to safety problems.    &quot;It doesn't surprise me that Eastern's maintenance expenses are high, because of the labor costs, the age of its fleet and the fact that they've had a lot of eyes looking at them recently,&quot; says an FAA official who participated in the Eastern safety inspection earlier this year and who asked not to be identified.    Eastern has improved its ranking since 1982, when it was in the middle of the pack for maintenance spending. Back then, the carrier couldn't afford to make some of the voluntary improvements to its aircraft that manufacturers recommended, says Edward F. Upton, Eastern's vice president for maintenance and engineering.    Mr. Upton acknowledges that the 1986 investigation spurred some of the increased maintenance spending. But he adds that Eastern's current management is voluntarily making substantial outlays to ensure the long-term health of its fleet. Recent improvements made to the Rolls-Royce engines in Eastern's L-1011 fleet will more than double their reliability, Mr. Upton says. He says Eastern also is making voluntary improvements on every engine on its Airbus planes.    United and American say their rankings are low because the sheer size of their fleets allows them to maintain the planes more efficiently, keeping costs down.    &quot;We have so many planes, we are able to schedule airplane maintenance on a more level pattern. We don't lose much productivity by having to take a plane out of service,&quot; says Joseph O'Gorman, United's senior vice president for maintenance operations.    AMR Corp.'s American Airlines says it has so many of the same type of plane -- about 130 MD-80s, for example, which are used for medium-range flights -- it can buy huge quantities of parts at lower prices.    Says Jeffrey Kriendler, a vice president at Pan Am, which ranked second from the bottom: &quot;Our maintenance people see this as a reflection of their efficiency. We have a very senior, professional maintenance staff. They know what they're doing.&quot; In addition, 31 of Pan Am's 129 planes are still under warranty to their manufacturers, which also helps to keep the carrier's maintenance needs down, he says.    Some industry analysts say that efficiency doesn't entirely explain why a large carrier would rank lower. That's because such a carrier presumably would have similar efficiencies in other parts of its operating budget, too -- which would help push its ranking in the other direction.    Delta Air Lines attributes its low ranking to the productivity of its employees and the fact that its fleet, with an average age of 8.4 years, is the youngest in the industry. Delta also says it doesn't include some costs, such as computer, purchasing and training expenses, when it reports its direct maintenance expenditures to the Transportation Department. Other airlines do, Delta says, inflating the percentage of operating costs spent on maintenance.    Other airlines say they also have some different definitions of maintenance spending. Pan Am, for instance, reports training costs -- but not computer costs.    The Transportation Department, however, says the reporting of maintenance expenses is fairly uniform. The numbers are taken from quarterly reports the airlines are required to file with the Transportation Department under the category &quot;Direct Maintenance -- Flight Equipment.&quot; The spending includes such items as labor, materials, and the amount paid for maintenance that is contracted out to other companies. But it doesn't include, for example, the cost of administrative overhead.    Of course, any standard of measurement has some pitfalls. Varying labor costs, for instance, account for some of the differences: The average hourly wage for an aircraft mechanic at Eastern, for instance, is $19.26, compared with $18.25 at Delta and $17.07 at Pan Am.    Also, year-to-year comparisons of maintenance spending are tricky, since the amount depends on how many planes are due for major overhauls in a given year. Special circumstances also can arise: United's 1988 maintenance spending will outweigh last year's, Mr. O'Gorman says, because the UAL Corp. unit has decided to overhaul the structure and nose portions of its 31 Boeing 747 aircraft.    USAir, for instance, says it went from a ranking of first to fourth over the past five years in terms of how much of its operating expenses goes toward maintenance because it acquired 79 new planes during that time. &quot;With new planes, we get pretty much of a free ride for three years on heavy maintenance,&quot; says Garner W. Miller, senior vice president for maintenance and engineering at the USAir Group Inc unit. &quot;Things just don't come due for major overhauls for quite a while.&quot;    The Journal's analysis of maintenance spending turned up another surprising result: As maintenance spending has climbed, the number of mechanics per aircraft has fallen at all but three carriers. The total number of aircraft mechanics, though, has increased 35% in the past five years to 46,182 from 34,305.    The number of mechanics per aircraft dropped the most at Delta, to 14 from 21. Eastern also had a large drop, to 16 per aircraft in 1987 from 22 in 1982. United had the biggest gain -- 21 for each plane, up from 17 five years ago. Pan Am has the most mechanics per aircraft -- 28 for each of its 129 planes. And Piedmont, also a USAir Group unit, has the least, with 9.7 for each of its 181 planes.    Pan Am's top ranking in the number of mechanics per aircraft -- despite its low rating in maintenance spending -- is due to its low wage structure, says Mr. Kriendler. That enables it to hire more mechanics.    Delta says it now performs many more maintenance checks by computer, reducing the need for as many mechanics. Eastern says it reduced its number of mechanics when it stopped performing contract maintenance for other airlines in 1986. The carrier also says it sold off a number of its larger airplanes in the past five years, further limiting the number of mechanics needed.    United's big increase in mechanics is due partly to the large amount of contract maintenance it performs; the carrier maintains 75 to 100 planes for other companies, a spokesman says. United also says it needs the extra mechanics because it has added aircraft in recent years. The carrier also performed major overhauls on several of its aircraft over the past five years, including the planes it received from Pan Am as part of the 1985 purchase of Pan Am's Pacific routes.    ---           Maintenance Money: Ranking the Airlines      Airlines' spending on direct maintenance in 1987                                  % of Operating Expenses                  Money Spent       1987           1982  Eastern       $4,470,310,098      7.8%           4.6%  Northwest      4,868,611,000      7.3            5.2  Continental    3,993,299,000      6.9            4.0  USAir          1,806,855,000      6.5            6.1  Piedmont       1,790,461,608      6.4            5.1  TWA            3,815,999,379      6.1            4.6  American       6,651,297,000      6.0            3.8  United         7,711,577,440      6.0            3.3  Pan Am         3,292,013,000      4.6            2.9  Delta          5,659,088,000      4.3            3.4   Source: Department of Transportation statistics as compiled by I.P.
