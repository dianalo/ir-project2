The tobacco and food company touched off the buying spreeby announcing details of a $6.9 billion refinancing designedto strengthen its balance sheet and ward off a potentialfinancial crisis. The plan includes retiring many of thecompany's most troublesome junk bonds by buying them back inthe open market and by an exchange offer.</LP><TEXT>   RJR Nabisco's announcement helped lift prices of otherhigh-yield, high-risk junk bonds yesterday. Elsewhere in theU.S. bond markets, though, most interest rates were littlechanged, taking a breather after having fallen late last weekas the Federal Reserve eased credit slightly.   Long-term Treasury bond yields hovered in a narrow bandall day yesterday, finishing the session almost exactly wherethey began. For example, 30-year Treasury bonds now yield8.45%, the same as late Friday. Treasury bill rates also wereflat, and municipal bond prices ended little changed.   Federal Reserve officials probably won't cut interestrates any further until a clearer picture of the economyemerges in August, investment managers and economists say.Several money managers fear that the Fed acted too soon, thatinflation will remain stubbornly high, and thus thatshort-term bonds represent a much better buy right now thanlong-term bonds.   Moreover, traders are bracing for a huge wave of U.S.government borrowing next month that some analysts predictwill nudge interest rates back up over the next few weeks.The Treasury's quarterly financing, which typically consistsof three-year notes, 10-year notes and 30-year bonds, isexpected in early August. &quot;There's also a great deal ofconcern about the budget deficit and concern that politics isruling the day&quot; once again, said William Brachfeld, executivevice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc.   While U.S. bonds stalled yesterday, British governmentbond prices surged in brisk trading. Traders cited theBritish pound's recent strength in the foreign-exchangemarkets as well as unexpectedly weak U.K. economic reportsthat could indicate reduced inflationary pressures. WestGerman government bond prices also climbed.   To keep the U.S. bond market rally going, &quot;new evidence ofa slower economy probably will have to emerge,&quot; said JohnLonski, senior economist at Moody's Investors Service Inc.&quot;However, we do not foresee a deep enough decline in economicactivity that would open the way for a significant bondrally.&quot;   Thomas G. Moles, managing director in charge of fixedincome investments at Jandamp;W Seligman Inc., agrees that the Fedprobably won't cut rates again in the near future. &quot;What theFed's going to do is sit back and see what the marketreaction is&quot; to last week's credit-easing move before takingfurther action, he said.   Still, Mr. Moles recommends buying longer-term bonds,especially top-rated issues. &quot;We're increasingly leaningtoward higher-quality issues,&quot; he said. &quot;Reaching for yield&quot;by buying lower-rated issues wouldn't be smart, he said, inview of the economy's listlessness.                                                                                                          Junk, Corporate Bonds                                                                                                          Investors reacted enthusiastically to RJR Nabisco Inc.'srefinancing plan.   RJR's 14.07% convertible pay-in-kind debentures, due in2009, which were reset to yield 17.375% under the new plan,soared 8 1/4 points to 114 3/8 on the New York StockExchange. Pay-in-kind debentures pay interest in the form ofaddition securities.   The other widely held RJR issue, the 14.07% exchangeablepay-in-kind debentures, maturing in 2007, which have beenreset to yield 17%, jumped 4 5/8 points to 91 3/4.   Investors who bought RJR Nabisco's bonds early this yearand held them have made a fortune. Prices of some issues havenearly doubled over the last six months amid speculation thatthe company's controlling owner, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co., would take steps to lighten RJR's enormous debt burden.KKR took the company private in a $25 billion leveragedtakeover, the largest in history.   Prices of other corporate junk bonds rose about one point,traders said. Also, while volume in RJR Pay-in-kind bonds wastriple the recent daily average, activity in other bonds wasabout double.   Among high-grade corporate bonds, prices were littlechanged. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and J.C. Penney Co. tapped themarkets with new debt issues.                                                                                                          Treasury Securities   Treasury bond yields hardly budged all day. Tradingactivity was sluggish.   Among actively traded issues, the government's 30-yearbonds were quoted late yesterday at a price of about 103 1/4,to yield 8.45%, the same as late Friday.   &quot;The bond market had its big excitement on Thursday andFriday&quot; of last week, said Joseph Liro, a vice president atS.G. Warburg andamp; Co. Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan disclosedThursday that the Fed was poised to ease credit. Then onFriday, the central bank acted, trimming rates slightly. TheFed's move resulted in a drop in the interest rate on federalfunds, or funds that banks lend each overnight, by 0.25percentage point to 8%.   But banks haven't yet responded by lowering their primelending rate, which remains stuck at 10%. The prime rate isclosely watched because banks use it as a peg to set rates ona large number of loans to individuals as well as small andmedium-sized companies.   The Treasury yesterday held its regular weekly sale of newthree-month and six-month bills. Here are details:                                                                                                          Rates are determined by the difference between thepurchase price and face value. Thus, higher bidding narrowsthe investor's return while lower bidding widens it. Thepercentage rates are calculated on a 360-day year, while thecoupon equivalent yield is based on a 365-day year.                                                                                                                                      13-Week           26-Week                                                                                                        Applications ............ $26,274,790,000   $27,785,000,000 Accepted bids ...........  $9,017,580,000    $9,020,615,000 Accepted at low price ...             18%               41% Accepted noncompet'ly ...  $1,460,770,000    $1,375,665,000 Average price (Rate) ....  98.074 (7.62%)    96.198 (7.52%) High price (Rate) .......  98.081 (7.59%)    96.203 (7.51%) Low price (Rate) ........  98.071 (7.63%)    96.193 (7.53%) Coupon equivalent .......           7.88%             7.93%                                                                                                          Both issues are dated July 19.

U.K. government bonds are attracting more investorsbecause of growing signs that Britain's weak economy willhelp depress inflation, pull down interest rates and drive upbond prices.   Investors also are attracted by Britain's high interestrates and its &quot;inverted yield curve,&quot; which means short-termrates there are higher than long-term bond yields.   Britain's 11.75% bonds due 2003/2007, which traders watchas an indicator of long-term bonds in general, climbedyesterday by 22/32 of a point yesterday to 102 31/32, toyield 11.30%.   Among other active issues, the 12% bonds due 1995 rose14/32 of a point to yield 12.01%. Traders cited retail salesand industrial production figures as evidence of U.K. economyweakness.

Bonn's8.75% benchmark bonds, due 2000, rose 0.45 point to 101.75 toyield 8.47%.   -- Japanese government bond prices inched higher.
