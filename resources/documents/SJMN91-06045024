No housing in territories  </CAPTION><DESCRIPT>  ISRAEL; GOVERNMENT; PLANNING; BUILDING; HOUSING  </DESCRIPT><LEADPARA>  The Israeli government is planning to build 12,000 homes for Jewish settlersin the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip in a three-year program that wouldincrease the Jewish population of the territories by more than 50 percent, twoopposition members of parliament said Wednesday.;    The legislators, who saidthey had obtained internal plans of the Construction and Housing Ministry,charged that the building program violates guarantees given by the governmentof Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir to the Bush administration in exchange for$400 million in loan guarantees for housing construction.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  General News  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  ISRAEL REPORTEDLY VIOLATING PLEDGE TO U.S.  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     More guarantees sought;  Shamir's government, which is seeking $10 billionmore in loan guarantees from Washington, promised last fall that it would notbuild housing in the territories for the hundreds of thousands of Sovietimmigrants now coming here. It also pledged not to direct the immigrants tosettlements and said it would provide the State Department with informationabout any settlement construction.;    However, leftist deputies Dedi Zuckerof the Citizen's Rights Movement and Chaim Oron of the Mapam Party said in athree-page report that about 2,500 Soviet immigrants already are living in theoccupied territories outside of Jerusalem. They suggested that new housingwould bring more Soviets to such areas. The immigration wave has caused asevere housing shortage in Israel, and Soviet arrivals virtually are forced tosettle wherever there are empty apartments.;    Difficulties after war; Zucker and Oron said the government building program, which would cost $750million over three years, &quot;has the aim of creating facts on the ground thatwill make it difficult for Israel to enter the political process that isexpected after the Persian Gulf war.&quot;;    They said that the building programis already under way and that the government is putting 1,000 mobile homes inJewish settlements in the Arab territories.;    At least 90,000 Jewishsettlers are estimated to live in about 140 communities scattered through theWest Bank and Gaza, which are home to 1.7 million Palestinians. The Bushadministration, which says Israel should trade captured land for peace withits neighbors, strongly opposes further Jewish settlement of the territories.The issue contributed to a sharp deterioration in U.S.-Israeli relations inthe two years before the gulf crisis.;    A spokesman for the HousingMinistry, which is run by Ariel Sharon, a hard-line leader of the Likud Party,did not respond Wednesday to several inquiries about the opposition report. Asenior adviser to Shamir, Avi Pazner, said the report &quot;sounds far-fetched&quot; butadded that he did not know whether it was correct.;    Since the formationlast June of Shamir's present cabinet, which includes far-right nationalistand religious parties, the government has refused to make its plans forsettlements public, although it has said settlement of the territories wouldcontinue.;    In recent weeks, sources here said, officials in Jerusalem havealso been at odds with the State Department over U.S. attempts to obtain thepromised information about settlements. State Department officials recentlycomplained that Israel's answers to questions about its settlement policy wereinadequate, officials here said.;    Aides to Shamir say the governmentresponded that, in its view, it had provided the State Department with all theinformation it requested. However, officials said, the $400 million in loanguarantees linked to the information request has still not been released byWashington, a delay that Secretary of State James Baker recently attributed to&quot;technical problems.&quot;;    Israeli commentators say the continuing problemswith the housing money -- which is only a fraction of what Israel hopes toobtain from the United States -- reflect the deep tensions that still underliethe wartime patina of cooperation and good will between the United States andIsrael. &quot;Relations continue to be poisoned in the triangle of Bush, Baker andShamir,&quot; journalist Dan Margalit observed in the newspaper Haaretz onWednesday.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Washington Post  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Jerusalem  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910214  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  647  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday February 14, 199100045024,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
