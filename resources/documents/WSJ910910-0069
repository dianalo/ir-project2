So it was a curious bit of posturing that emanated fromthe Banking Committee the other day: A report complainingthat banks regulated by the Comptroller of the Currency hadbeen the most costly to the bank insurance fund, while thoseregulated by the Fed hadn't cost a dime. Those regulated bythe FDIC fell somewhere in between. This means, the reportconcluded, that the Fed is a wonderful supervisor and theComptroller's Office a lousy one.</LP><TEXT>   But maybe it means that bank failures at too-big-to-failbanks are less likely than at others. Or maybe giving littlebanks the same scrutiny as larger banks is prohibitivelyexpensive. Or, for certain, you can't police 3,950 banks withthe Comptroller's 2,376 examiners, who are on average 35years old and make $47,500 a year. Or maybe there is no forceyou can muster to do the job so long as you promise to insureall bank deposits up to $100,000 per account, with anunlimited number of accounts.   Then again, maybe it means the Fed is less responsive thanother regulators to Congressmen lobbying on behalf of theirlocal bank or campaign contributor. Even if regulators try tobe tough it's hard to stand up to Congressmen, as Ed Grayfound when Jim Wright sat on the recapitalization of theFederal Home Loan Bank Board. Speaker Wright was upsetbecause examiners were too tough on Texas thrifts, includingDon Dixon's Vernon Savings andamp; Loan, which went down with some96% bad loans.   We guess what the Banking Committee report means is thatCongress -- having accomplished all this, plus defeating acapital-gains tax cut and forcing thrifts to dump junk bondsbecause they were too profitable -- is now ready to paradethe heads of a few bank examiners, just to show that itcares.   In the first tumbril is Robert Clarke, the presentComptroller, who has been nominated for reappointment butkept on hold by their majesties in the Senate. Senate BankingCommittee hearings on his nomination have been delayed toSeptember 26. By then the committee, headed by Senator DonRiegle, a charter member of the Keating Five, is to havefigured out what went wrong at the Bank of New England.   It is a bit curious to see Mr. Clarke pilloried forlaxity, since the first drive against his reappointment camefrom those who thought him too tough. They were reacting tohis crackdown in New England and a burst of toughsoundingspeeches. Mr. Clarke, it seems, caught the change in thedirection of the wind from Congress, and tried to adjust hissails accordingly. Or at least, his best shot at confirmationis to start parading the heads of bankers. The same spirit isworking its way through the examining corps at all theregulatory institutions; last week on these pages a bankowner reported that an examiner wanted the bank to get back$17.32 a manager spent taking a subordinate to lunch.   We don't mean to attack Mr. Clarke and his overworkedexaminers, who are doing the best they can under a reign offear. Former Comptroller John G. Heimann, now in marginallysafer quarters at Merrill Lynch, put it well in a May 24article on this page: &quot;many bank examiners believe they willbe exposed to criticism from their bosses or Congress if theyuse their judgment. No examiner has ever been criticized forbeing too tough. So, some examiners have discarded balancedjudgment for the most conservative application of the rulebooks.&quot; This spreads the fear to bankers, who deny creditwhen the economy needs it.   This is one of the biggest reasons the current economicrecovery shows so little pep. We are running a slow-motionversion of 1980, when the economy plunged into recession themoment the Carter administration announced a program of&quot;credit control,&quot; and bounced back six months later when thecontrols were lifted. This time the regulatory credit crunchwasn't announced and came less dramatically, but for the samereason is harder to stop.   Even if deposit insurance were pared back, we'd still wantbank examinations. We shouldn't expect examiners to look overthe shoulder of every lending officer, but they should beable to blow the whistle on the Charley Keatings and DonDixons. Striking a balance between being too lax and toostrict is not an easy thing to do; speeches about &quot;easing up&quot;are not likely to be productive.   Given the current circumstances, though, a campaignagainst lax examinations is fighting the last war. It willnot build the right kind of regulatory structure andcertainly will not help the economy. The only purpose it willserve is to provide a scapegoat getting the spotlight off theCongress.</TEXT></DOC>
