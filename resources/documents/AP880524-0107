WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A leading Soviet sociologist says citizen groupsadvocating new policies could be formed to advise the CommunistParty leadership, but that formation of rival political partieswould be unconstitutional.   Tatiana Zaslavskaya, a sociologist and party adviser, saidMonday she supports the idea of ``social institutions or peoplesunions'' to assist the nation's only legal political party.   Speaking at a news conference, Ms. Zaslavskaya and prominentpolitical scientist Fyodor M. Burlatsky dismissed the efforts ofdissident groups to form a separate political party challenging theCommunist Party. They said the Communist Party's monopoly on poweris protected by the Soviet constitution.   Some independent citizen panels championing causes such asprotection of the environment and historic preservation alreadyhave been formed, but Ms. Zaslavskaya did not make clear to whatdegree she supports the existing groups.   She mentioned that an organization such as a ``peoples union''or popular front could be formed to promote Soviet leader MikhailS. Gorbachev's reforms. Such organizations exist in other EastEuropean countries that are controlled by Communist parties.   Formation of an umbrella popular front to bring together theindependent groups would allow the government and party to retaincontrol over public debate and discussion, while at the same timegiving Soviets an opportunity to take part in the politicaldecision-making process.   A group of dissidents announced May 9 that they had formed theDemocratic Union, a new party to challenge the current one-partysystem.   ``Those who suggest forming a new party are going beyond theconstitution,'' Burlatsky said, describing those efforts as``childhood diseases of pluralism.''   ``The leading role of the Communist Party is not justtraditional, but the constitutional norm,'' he added.   But Burlatsky, like Zaslavskaya, said Gorbachev's efforts tointroduce more democracy and openness into Soviet society meanbroader distribution of power among the people.   ``I don't see any social background for creation of a secondparty,'' Ms. Zaslavskaya commented. ``But the Communist Party insome way should be supplemented with social institutions or peoplesunions. This would contribute to the consolidation of perestroika.''   Zaslavskaya appeared to criticize the party's monopoly on powerwhen asked about the system for selecting the 5,000 delegates tothe June party conference. She is a candidate to become aconference delegate.   ``The fact that the party delegates are selected by the partymachinery, by the party committees, effects the procedure, and notin every case can it be called a democratic effect,'' she said.   Zaslavskaya advises the party leadership and her ideas have beenbroadly incorporated into the reform campaign since Gorbachev cameto power.</TEXT></DOC>
