BarrettStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> MCICEARNINGS (ERN)TELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   MCI Communications Corp. posted a 22% rise in third-quarter profit, supporting predictions that the struggling company will gain a steadier foothold in the long-distance telephone industry.    The company's performance matched or exceeded analysts' projections. MCI had &quot;reached our low point&quot; in the second quarter and expects to &quot;steadily gain market share while controlling costs&quot; in the future, said Daniel Akerson, the chief financial officer.    For the latest quarter, MCI posted net of $22 million, or eight cents a share, compared with $18 million, or six cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 9.2% to $994 million from $910 million.    Earnings in the latest period include an after-tax gain of $5 million for tax-loss carry-forwards and a pretax gain of $2 million on the company's previously reported settlement of antitrust litigation. Figures for the year-earlier period also included several nonrecurring items. Among those items were an after-tax gain of about $33 million on the sale of a subsidiary and an after-tax charge of $17 million for early extinguishment of debt.    The concern's basic operations, excluding all recurring items, earned six cents a share in the latest quarter, compared with one cent a share a year earlier, Mr. Akerson said.    MCI, the second-largest long-distance phone company, achieved &quot;unusually strong&quot; revenue growth despite rate reductions totaling 12% for the year, said John Bain, an analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers. At the same time, profit margins improved as most operating-expense categories declined as a percent of revenue, Mr. Akerson said.    Although MCI is paying more for access to local telephone networks as it expands service, the company is slashing overall operating expenses, Mr. Akerson said. He estimated MCI's expenses for the first three quarters at $450 million to $475 million, compared with about $700 million for the year-earlier period.    Despite the company's encouraging results, analysts warned that MCI still faces an uncertain regulatory environment and the threat of further price-cutting by the No. 1 long-distance company, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Industry-wide rate reductions have severely hurt MCI's earnings for the past year.    Jack Grubman, an analyst at PaineWebber Inc. who used to work for ATandamp;T, said, &quot;The big question for (MCI's) longer-term prognosis is, will its competitive position get better.&quot; The company estimates its share of the long-distance market at 10% to 12%, compared with about 8% a year ago. </TEXT></DOC>
