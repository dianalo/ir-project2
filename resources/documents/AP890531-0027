What had been a chorus of criticism turned into a crescendo ofapplause Tuesday as Bush emerged from Brussels, Belgium, with theNATO alliance solidly behind the new U.S. proposal on conventionalarms cuts, and united again on short-range nuclear missile strategy.   ``We may be at an important turning point in history, one inwhich the security environment in Europe can be transformed,'' saidSenate Majority Leader George Mitchell of Maine.   ``The specter of war which has haunted that continent throughoutthe 20th century may be receding,'' said Michell, who previouslyhad criticized Bush as slow to respond to Soviet President MikhailGorbachev's disarmament initiatives.   ``The president hit all the right chords with his proposals onconventional arms reductions in Europe,'' said Rep. Les Aspin,D-Wis., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.   Aspin said, ``the agreement seems to guard againstdenuclearization of Europe, which was his and (British PrimeMinister) Margaret Thatcher's greatest fear.''   Aspin, long a watchdog of Pentagon spending, added there couldbe ``substantial'' savings for U.S. taxpayers if Bush convinces theSoviets to buy his plan for deep troop cuts in Europe.   Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Sam Nunn, D-Ga., saidBush's proposal underscores ``the dangerous Soviet conventional(weapons) advantages'' and gives NATO a ``sound negotiatingposition.''   Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., chairman of the Senate ForeignRelations Committee, said, ``I applaud and very much support thepresident's decision to move along this path.''   ``I trust that this proposal will be approved by our NATO alliesand by the Soviets,'' said Pell.   Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., said Gorbachev and Bush now havecreated ``a once-in-a-century opportunity to transform theEast-West security relationship.''   ``With his latest proposals, the president has shown that he isconvinced that Gorbachev is ready to change the military balance inEurope, and that he is willing to commit the U.S. to be an activepartner in this process,'' Levin said.   Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., D-Del., chairman of the ForeignRelations subcommittee on European affairs, said Bush put ``a verysubstantive'' conventional arms proposal on the table, along with``a politically necessary'' nuclear proposal.   ``He has demonstrated an understanding of the dynamic at work inNATO in terms of responding to Gorbachev,'' Biden said.   Moreover, the president has silenced, at least for the moment,those who criticized his allegedly dilatory start in coming togrips with the challenge poised by the Gorbachev inititives, Bidensaid.   ``The time had nearly run out and I think he took it right up tothe wire,'' Biden said. ``But I think it's sort of a vindicationfor him.''</TEXT></DOC>
