The judge, Vincent J. Aug Jr., also allowed Federated to pay thestate of Indiana about $1 million in unpaid sales tax from late1988 and early 1989. Federated lawyers told Aug they are trying toget Kentucky to pay back about $1 million in sales tax the retaileroverpaid to that state.   The letter of credit from IBJ Schroder Bank andamp; Trust Co. of NewYork is good for $100 million and could be extended to $150million. It is effective through Feb. 6, 1992, and will replace aCitibank letter of credit expiring Feb. 3.   The Citibank credit was good for borrowings of as much as $150million. The retailers have used $70 million of that amount so far,Federated spokeswoman Carol Sanger said.   Federted and Allied attorney Cory Lipoff said the new letter ofcredit should reassure foreign vendors that the companies'retailing operations are healthy.   Federated and Allied, both based in Cincinnati and owned byCampeau Corp. of Toronto, have been operating under bankruptcycourt supervision since January.   Lawyers for the retailers said Indiana and Kentuckyinadvertently received each other's tax payments from Federated forsales at Lazarus department stores from November 1988 to January1989.   Federated said it didn't learn of the error until last June andhas been trying to persuade Kentucky to return the overpayment.Federated said it owes Indiana $969,676, which includes sales taxplus interest.   Federated wants a reimbursement of $1.13 million from Kentucky,which has refused the request. Federated is threatening to bringthe dispute into federal bankruptcy court if it isn't resolved.   Federated and Allied together employ about 110,000 people andoperate 255 stores in 28 states.</TEXT></DOC>
