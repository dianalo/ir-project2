In January, industry sources said that American planned to split a $2.4 billion order for wide-body aircraft between Seattle-based Boeing Co. and Airbus Industrie, a move unusual in the airline industry. According to a report in The Wall Street Journal, sources said then that instead of buying the jets, American would acquire them under a lease arrangement that would make it possible to return the planes to the manufacturers on short notice.    The sources expect American, the airline unit of AMR Corp., which is based here, to announce the purchase along the lines outlined in January at a news conference scheduled this morning at 9 a.m. EST at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel in New York. &quot;I understand American is going to confirm the sale on Tuesday morning,&quot; said Jordan Greene, president of Miami-based Avmark Services Ltd. and editor of a newsletter that tracks aircraft sales.    American wouldn't comment on the specific news to be released today. A spokesman said, however, that it would be a &quot;significant announcement that relates to the growth plan.&quot;    The Journal reported in January that American planned to buy 15 Boeing 767 jets and 25 Airbus A-300 planes. Airbus is a European consortium of French, West German, British and Spanish aircraft companies.    American has never confirmed the details of the transaction as outlined by industry sources. However, the company has confirmed in recent weeks that it talked with both manufacturers and other aircraft makers. </TEXT></DOC>
