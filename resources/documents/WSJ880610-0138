The variants are substrains of human immunodeficiency virus type 2, a more recently discovered and comparatively rarer form of the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. The teams' reports offer insights into the biology of the AIDS virus, its various degrees of virulence and the variety of its targets in the human body.    A team led by Louise A. Evans and Jay A. Levy at the University of California at San Francisco said they isolated a substrain of HIV-2 in a patient in the Ivory Coast who later died of neurologic disease and a diahrreal syndrome known as &quot;Slim's disease.&quot;    The substrain, which the researchers named HIV-2-UC1, infected T-4 white blood cells, as do other versions of the AIDS virus, but didn't exhibit the same cell-killing powers in the blood. In particular, it failed to make white blood cells fuse together to form giant cells known as syncytia that explode and die. Such decimations of the the immune system are a hallmark of HIV-1, the form of the AIDS virus that was discovered first and is most common.    The team, which worked in collaboration with doctors at Treichville Hospital in Abidjian, cautioned that the cell-killing ability might be a development of a terminal stage of the disease, and said that later blood samples from the patient weren't available. But the report, published in today's edition of Science, lends credence to a body of opinion that HIV-2 in some cases may not ravage T-4 cells -- immune sentries of the bloodstream -- as much as it harms cells of the brain or bowel, said Dr. Levy in an interview.    &quot;You may have variants that home in on the brain and bowel rather than on the lymphocytes,&quot; or T-4 cells, Dr. Levy said. He stressed that even though the new strain infects T-cells without killing them, &quot;it still causes disease.&quot; For this reason, he isn't proposing the new strain be considered as the basis for a vaccine, as had some earlier researchers in the field.    In a second paper in this week's Science, a team from the University of Alabama and from the University of Pennsylvania, said they isolated another substrain of HIV-2, from a healthy prostitute in Senegal. The strain, though different from the one isolated by the California team, was less cytopathic, or lethal to T-cells, than expected.    &quot;Although HIV-2 may cause a fatal immunodeficiency, studies have suggested that many West African individuals infected with HIV-2 or a related virus may have less severe immunodeficiency than individuals infected with HIV-1,&quot; said the report, authored by Lilly I. Kong, George Shaw and colleagues.    Both of the papers in Science drew conclusions based on a single patient, a fact that led some observers to interpret the findings with caution.    &quot;These are interesting observations,&quot; said Samuel Broder of the National Cancer Institute. &quot;But one should use extreme caution in declaring a virus non-cytopathic on the basis of experiments in tissue culture.&quot; Like Dr. Levy, he noted such viruses &quot;still could damage other types of cells in the body,&quot; such as macrophagescells in the immune system -- and cells of the nervous system. </TEXT></DOC>
