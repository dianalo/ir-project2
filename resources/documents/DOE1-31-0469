A comparison with predictions from various phaseshift sets and potential models reveals sizeable deviations from thedata for the Paris potential and Saclay phase shifts. For the Paris potentialthe deviations are directly related to an overprediction of the /sup3/D/sub 2/ phase shift parameter.</TEXT></DOC>
