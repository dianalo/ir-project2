Applicant's primary function will be to raise fundsthrough the sale of debt securities and to invest in or loan money to Midlanticor Midlantic's other direct or indirect subsidiaries. Although Applicanthas no present intention to do so, it may in the future raise funds throughthe sale of non-voting preferred stock.

The debt securitiesand non-voting preferred stock, if any, will be guaranteed by Midlanticas follows:(a) Applicant's debt securities issued to or held by the public will beunconditionally guaranteed by Midlantic as to payment of principal, interestand premium, if any (except that the guarantee may be subordinated in rightof payment to other debt of Midlantic);(b) Applicant's non-voting preferred stock issued to or held by the publicwill be unconditionally guaranteed by Midlantic as to payment of dividends,payment of the liquidation preference in the event of liquidation, andpayments to be made under a sinking fund, if a sinking fund is to be provided(except that the guarantee may be subordinated in right of payment to otherdebt of Midlantic);(c) Midlantic's guarantee will provide that in the event of a default inpayment of principal, interest, premium, <ITAG tagnum="54">dividends, liquidation preference or payments made under a sinkingfund, if any, on any debt securities or non-voting preferred stock issuedby Applicant, the holders of those securities may institute legal proceedingsdirectly against Midlantic to enforce the guarantee without first proceedingagainst Applicant;</ITAG>(d) The debt securities and non-voting preferred stock issued by Applicantwill be convertible or exchangeable only for securities issued by Midlanticor for debt securities or non-voting preferred stock will meet applicableconditions set forth in the preceding three subparagraphs.6. Applicant will invest or loan at least 85% of any cash or cash equivalentraised through the offering of its debt securities or non-voting preferredstock or through other borrowings as soon as practicable, but in no eventlater than six months after Applicant's receipt of such cash or cash equivalents,only in or to the following: (i) Midlantic, (ii) MBI, (iii) CBI, (iv) theBank Subsidiaries, (v) Midlantic's non-bank subsidiaries excepted fromthe definition of investment company under section 3(c)(3), section 3(c)(4),section 3(c)(5) or section 3(c)(6) of the 1940 Act (such non-bank subsidiariesare hereinafter collectively referred to as the ``section 3(c)(3)-(6) Subsidiaries'')or (vi) Midlantic's other direct or indirect subsidiaries which qualitfyas ``companies controlled by the parent company'' as defined in Rule 3a-5under the 1940 Act. At no time will Applicant invest in, reinvest in, own,hold or trade in securities other than (i) Government securities, (ii)securities of Midlantic, MBI, CBI, the Bank Subsidiaries, the section 3(c)(3)-(6)Subsidiaries or Midlantic's other direct or indirect subsidiaries whichqualify as ``companies controlled by the parent company'' as defined inRule 3a-5, and (iii) debt securities which are exempted from the provisionsof the Securities Act of 1933 (``1933 Act'') by section 3(a)(3) of the1933 Act or (iv) bank certificates of deposit, including negotiable Eurodollarcertificates of deposit and domestic bank certificates of deposit, eachof which will be of such a principal amount as to not be marketed to thegeneral public and will have a maturity no greater than that permittedfor securities exempted from the provisions of the 1933 Act by section3(a)(3) thereof (whether or not such certificates are exempted by section3(a)(3) of the 1933 Act) (``Certificates''). All of the Certificates willbe issued by internationally active financial institutions (i) which areorganized in countries where such financial institutions are comprehensivelyregulated as to their capital adequacy and other factors relating to theirfinancial soundness by central banks and/or other sovereign bank regulatoryauthorities (in the United States these entities are the Board of Governorsof the Federal Reserve System (``Federal Reserve Board''), the Comptrollerof the Currency (``Comptroller''), and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation(``FDIC''), and (ii) which have been approved for investment for the fundsof the Bank Subsidiaries by Midlantic National Bank's Investment Department,which approvals are subject to review by the Federal Reserve Board, theFDIC and the Comptroller.7. Applicant will not engage in business with any entities other than Midlanticor Midlantic's other direct or indirect subsidiaries, apart from the issuanceof debt securities or non-voting preferred stock guaranteed by Midlanticas described above and temporary investment of excess funds.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicant's Legal Analysis</ITAG>1. The business to be conducted by Applicant may cause it to fall withinthe types of businesses described in section 3(a)(1) or 3(a)(3) of the1940 Act. Applicant may not rely on the safe harbor provided by Rule 3a-5because Midlantic may not be considered a ``parent company'' under Rule3a-5(b)(2). As a bank holding company primarily engaged through its directand indirect subsidiaries in the business of banking, Midlantic may bean investment company under section 3(a) of the 1940 Act. Midlantic's exemptstatus under the 1940 Act therefore is derived from section 3(c)(6) ofthe 1940 Act.2. Applicant may not rely on the safe harbor provided by Rule 3a-5 becauseeach of MBI, CBI, the Bank Subsidiaries and the section 3(c)(3)-(6) Subsidiariesmay not be considered a ``company controlled by the parent company'' underRule 3a-5(b)(3). Any of MBI, CBI, the Bank Subsidiaries and the section3(c)(3)-(6) Subsidiaries may be an investment company under section 3(a)of the 1940 Act and may not be excepted or exempted under section <ITAG tagnum="54">3(b) of the 1940 Act. Applicant states that: (i) Both MBI and CBIare bank holding companies primarily engaged through their direct subsidiariesin the business of banking, and that each MBI's and CBI's exempt statusunder the 1940 Act therefore is derived from section 3(c)(6) of the 1940Act; (ii) the Bank Subsidiaries are banks involved primarily in the businessof banking, and that their exempt status under the 1940 Act therefore isderived from section 3(c)(3) of the 1940 Act; and (iii) the section 3(c)(3)-(6)Subsidiaries derived their exempt status under the 1940 Act from section3(c)(3), section 3(c)(4), section 3(c)(5) or section 3(c)(6) of the 1940Act. The activities of MBI, CBI, the Bank Subsidiaries and the section3(c)(3)-(6) Subsidiaries do not raise the concerns that prompted the exclusionof entities exempted from the definition of investment company under section3(c) of the 1940 Act from the definition of ``company controlled by theparent company'' under Rule 3a-5(b)(3). Accordingly, the failure of MBI,CBI, the Bank Subsidiaries and section 3(c)(3)-(6) Subsidiaries to satisfythe definitional requirements of Rule 3a-5(b)(3) should not prevent issuanceof the requested exemption order. </ITAG>3. Applicant may not rely on the safe harbor provided by Rule 3a-5 becauseApplicant proposes to invest in, hold, trade and own Certificates as wellas government securities, debt securities which are exempt from the provisionsof the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, by section 3(a)(3) of that act,and securities of Midlantic, MBI, CBI, the Bank Subsidiaries, the section3(c)(3)-(6) Subsidiaries or Midlantic's other direct or indirect subsidiarieswhich qualify as a ``company controlled by the parent company'' as definedin Rule 3a-5. The Commission's stated intention in adopting Rule 3a-5 wasto permit a finance subsidiary to invest in, hold, own and trade shortterm money market instruments so that the finance subsidiary had flexibilityin short term management of the proceeds of its securities offering. AlthoughCertificates are not expressly included in the list of securities a financesubsidiary may invest in, trade, own or hold under Rule 3a-5(a)(6), Certificatesare short term money market instruments which would afford a finance subsidiaryappropriate flexibility in its short term cash management without sacrificingsecurity or otherwise impairing reasonable cash management. Applicant assertsthat Certificates are at least as secure as certain investments otherwisepermitted under Rule 3a-5(a)(6). Accordingly, Applicant's investment in,owning, trading and holding Certificates should not prevent issuance ofthe requested exemption order. 4. On the basis of the foregoing, granting the requested exemption is appropriatein the public interest and consistent with the protection of investorsand the proposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the 1940Act.<ITAG tagnum="21">For the Commission, by the Division of Investment Management, underdelegated authority.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
