Neither Time Warner Inc. nor departing co-Chief ExecutiveOfficer N.J. Nicholas Jr. is saying. But a close analysis ofMr. Nicholas's employment agreement and of Time Warner proxymaterial suggests that he may walk away from the company withcompensation of anywhere from $24 million to $44.5 million,including payments covering his salary, bonus, deferred payand stock options.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;By any standards, one would have to conclude that it{will be} a generous and attractive severance arrangement,&quot;says Walton Winder, a vice president at consulting firmTowers Perrin, which performed the analysis of the termsdisclosed in Time Warner's annual proxies.   While many details of Mr. Nicholas's employment agreementare spelled out in public documents, the final figure dependson a number of assumptions, including agreement on how tovalue his stock options. Still, the sum will almost certainlysurpass the controversial package given in 1987 to ThomasWyman, the CBS Inc. chairman and chief executive officer wholeft the company in a dispute with major shareholders. Mr.Wyman was given $2.8 million in cash and a $400,000 annualpayment for life.   Theoretically, Mr. Nicholas could be given nothing at allbeyond what he's already earned. Time Warner maintains thatMr. Nicholas's departure was voluntary -- which under hisemployment contract wouldn't require any additional paymentsby the company. But compensation professionals say that wouldbe almost unprecedented at such senior levels. &quot;In any ofthese situations you want the guy to go away and not write abook about `My Days at Time Warner,'&quot; says compensationconsultant Michael Guthman of the consulting firm HewittAssociates.   Towers Perrin based its estimate on Mr. Nicholas'semployment agreement, disclosed in the company's 1991 proxystatement, and on its assessment of the value of his stockoptions as outlined in other proxy materials. The employmentagreement covers Mr. Nicholas's full-time employment at TimeWarner through July of 1999. Based on the salary and bonus of$2.4 million disclosed in last year's proxy statement, thepresent value -- that is, the value today of future earnings-- of his salary and bonus over the rest of his contract is$13.8 million.   His contract also promises deferred compensation equal tohalf his annual bonus, which suggests a present value of anadditional $3 million.   Mr. Nicholas's employment agreement also calls for anadditional five years' consulting arrangement at an amountthat, based on the last reported compensation arrangement,would total roughly $2.25 million a year. At that rate, thepresent value of that consulting arrangement would be $5.7million.   The contract doesn't make clear whether Mr. Nicholas wouldbe owed payment only for his 10-year full-time contract, orfor the additional five years' consultancy. Thus, thepossible reimbursement for his cash compensation could rangefrom $16.8 million to $22.5 million.   As for stock options, it appears that the smallest amountMr. Nicholas would leave with would be the paper profit hehas already accrued on stock options he now holds. Accordingto the 1991 proxy statement, the most recent record publiclyavailable, Mr. Nicholas held 531,000 options to buy TimeWarner stock. Towers Perrin figures that gain to be about$7.2 million.   A more generous settlement would buy out his stock optionsbased on an estimated value over their remaining life. Onewidely used formula suggests a theoretical value of $22million for those options.   Mr. Nicholas also takes with him pension benefits thatyield him $685,000 a year to be paid beginning at age 65.</TEXT></DOC>
