The dollar's rebound was another demonstration of its recent resilience and stability despite a continued flow of troubling news. Some traders attributed its relatively calm performance this month to the effects of last month's interventions by several nations to support the U.S. currency and the possibility that central banks might act again on its behalf.    Traders also cited Japan's recent pressure on Japanese companies to refrain from speculative dollar selling. It was learned yesterday that this pressure has been sharply increased this week.    &quot;Citicorp was another blow to the market, but it staggers and comes back,&quot; Jeff Mondschein, a trader at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, New York, said.    The dollar, he said, &quot;has been locked up in a very narrow range.&quot;    The Citibank announcement again focused attention on fears that problem loans to developing countries could hurt the U.S. banking system and jolt the nation's economy. In announcing its loss projection, Citicorp said it is adding $3 billion to its loan-loss reserve for foreign and domestic credits.    Some traders said the dollar's recovery yesterday simply corrected an overreaction to the Citicorp news. In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.7752 West German marks, compared with 1.7710 a day earlier. The dollar also rose fractionally to 139.75 Japanese yen from 139.63.    In early trading today in Tokyo, the dollar was quoted at 139.90 yen.    The dollar's recent stability has led some traders to conclude that last month's coordinated intervention by the central banks of the U.S. and its top economic allies is finally registering in the market.    The U.S., West Germany, Japan, Britain and France agreed in February to act to keep exchange rates among major currencies more stable. Last month, the central banks of those countries reportedly bought about $30 billion in the currency markets, led by aggressive buying by the Bank of Japan.    &quot;Thirty billion dollars out of the market has got to have an effect eventually,&quot; one trader said.    Merrill Lynch's Mr. Mondschein said the &quot;specter&quot; of further intervention is an intimidating factor now for potential dollar sellers.    Traders also say the Japanese government's arm-twisting has helped to calm the dollar. Last week, Finance Ministry officials asked chief executive officers of Japan's largest financial institutions to stop speculative selling of the U.S. currency. Yesterday, reports from Tokyo said the Finance Ministry was sharply stepping up its pressure by demanding that banks disclose their dollar positions to the government.    According to banking sources, the Finance Ministry told Japanese banks Tuesday to report on their day-to-day currency positions once a week, effective yesterday.    The banks reportedly are being asked to disclose the largest foreign-exchange positions they held at four &quot;checkpoints&quot; each day.    Audrey A. McNiff, a trader at Irving Trust Co., New York, said she wondered whether the Finance Ministry's &quot;surveillance&quot; was responsible for the dollar remaining unchanged from its opening in Tokyo trading yesterday.    &quot;It had to have had an effect,&quot; she said. Normally, heavy dollar selling would have been expected in Tokyo after news such as the Citicorp announcement. &quot;The Far East usually overreacts to such events,&quot; Ms. McNiff said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $4.80 an ounce to $472.30 in heavy trading estimated at eight million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $472.65 an ounce in early trading Thursday in Hong Kong.    ---                      LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Wednesday, May 20, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
