Oil analysts here speculated that the agency paid an average of 83 pence ($1.47) a share, or a total of #498 million ($879.7 million), for the BP stock.    BP's announcement followed three days of hectic trading in the oil giant's partly paid shares. Yesterday, 320 million of the new BP shares changed hands, accounting for about 41.3% of total volume on London's stock exchange. The shares traded at 82 pence each late in the day, down three pence.    For the past two weeks, oil-stock analysts had suspected that the Kuwaiti agency was amassing a big stake in BP. Traders said the agency appeared to have first accumulated a 4.9% stake, just below the 5% level at which investors must disclose their holdings in Britain. The remaining 5.16% probably was purchased Tuesday and yesterday, analysts said.    The second-largest holder of BP shares is Britain's Prudential Corp., which owns &quot;just below 2%,&quot; according to a BP spokesman. The British life-insurance concern isn't related to Prudential Insurance Co. of America.    Analysts don't expect the Kuwaiti agency to boost its BP stake further or seek any closer relationship with the British oil company. The agency probably likes &quot;the look of the oil market over the next two or three years at least,&quot; said Jack Jones, an oil analyst at the London stockbrokerage Phillips andamp; Drew.    The recent stock-market rout and the overhang of BP shares from the government's offering &quot;presented perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to buy {BP} stock in volume without moving the price too much,&quot; Mr. Jones added. &quot;If we had a normal market, buying a stake of 10% would have driven the price up considerably.&quot;    The government offered its nearly one-third stake in BP last month at a partly paid price of 120 pence a share. The terms were set before the crash in global equity markets pushed BP's share price well below the offer price. As a result, the issue's underwriters were left holding most of the stock.    The Kuwaiti agency wouldn't have notified BP of its holding yesterday if the agency intended to buy more shares soon, analysts agreed. In Britain, investors must disclose their holdings above 5% within five days, meaning the agency didn't have to reveal its stake until sometime next week. Announcements of sizable stock purchases tend to boost a company's share price, making further purchases more expensive. But in this case, BP's partly paid shares closed lower yesterday because the market didn't expect further buying by the Kuwaiti agency or others.    What's more, political leaders and business executives might raise objections if the agency tried to buy more BP shares. That alone likely would deter the agency, said Michael Unsworth, an oil analyst at the London brokerage Smith New Court. </TEXT></DOC>
