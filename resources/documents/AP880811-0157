It was the second attempt by the Senate to approve a defensebill President Reagan will accept. Reagan vetoed the first measurelast week because of cuts in his Star Wars budget along with armscontrol restrictions he opposed.   The new version retains the same Star Wars reductions, but noneof the arms control limitations. It will now go to a House-Senateconference committee to resolve differences between the twochambers' versions.   The vote was the last major item on the Senate agenda before asummer recess for next week's Republican presidential convention.   Voting against the bill were Sens. Kent Conrad, D-N.D.; MarkHatfield, R-Ore.; Claiborne Pell, D-R.I.; and William Proxmire,D-Wis. Not voting were Sens. Joseph Biden, D-Del.; Thad Cochran,R-Miss.; Bob Kasten, R-Wis.; Larry Pressler, R-S.D.; LowellWeicker, R-Conn.; and James Exon, D-Neb.   Earlier today, the Senate gave voice vote approval to a``burden-sharing'' proposal backed by Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,chairman of the Armed Services Committee.   The plan orders a major review by the Pentagon of U.S. overseascommitments, a new cap on U.S. troop deployments to Japan and SouthKorea, and a new ceiling on spending for U.S. military personnelstationed overseas. U.S. allies would have to pay for the Americantroops if the costs rise above the 1988 levels.   But before adopting the amendment, the Senate voted 59-36 toeliminate a provision for a 10 percent reduction in the total ofAmerican dependents stationed overseas with servicemen.   ``I can't think of anything more damaging to the morale of ourtroops than to limit dependents,'' said Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas,an opponent of the limit.   But Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said, ``enough is enough. Wehave 413,000 dependents worldwide. That is far more than any othernation in history.''   There has been an increasingly loud chorus of election-yearcongressional calls for more defense help, particularly from Japanand European members of the 16-nation North Atlantic TreatyOrganization.   ``Despite the shift in economic fortunes'' since World War II,``the United States bears a disproportionate share of the cost ofthe common defense,'' Nunn said Wednesday.   ``Someplace, sometime, we have to draw the line,'' said Nunn.``I hope this will stimulate a more equitable burden-sharing.''   Sen. Ted Stevens, R-Alaska, agreed: ``There's a limit to thepocketbooks of the taxpayers of the United States.''   Senate Majority Leader Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., said, ``There havebeen legitimate complaints in the United States that we are bearinga disproportionately large burden in NATO today.''   Later, the chamber gave voice vote endorsement to an amendmentby Sen. David Pryor, D-Ark., which would require defenseconsultants to register and list all their clients.   Pryor's amendment arises in the wake of the ongoing Pentagonbribery investigation, which involves allegations that consultantspaid Defense Department officials for inside information aboutfuture contracts. No charges have yet been filed.   ``How bad do we want this system to get before we finally paysome attention to it?'' Pryor asked.   Earlier Wednesday, the Senate voted to add a Pentagon spendingplan praised by Reagan to its latest defense budget effort.   In addition, the chamber, with all Republicans voting ``no,''voted 49-47 approval of a Democratic-backed plan to provide $27million in humanitarian aid to Nicaragua's Contra rebels after Oct.1. The vote could mean a possible second vote in Congress this fallon releasing $16.3 million in stockpiled weapons to the Contras,who oppose Nicaragua's leftist Sandinista government.   Last week, Reagan vetoed the bill which authorizes the Pentagonbudget for the fiscal year starting Oct. 1. He specificallyobjected to cuts in his proposed Star Wars budget andDemocratic-backed restrictions on arms control policies.   The authorization measure is the first step of the two-trackcongressional budget process, which also includes an appropriationbill to pay for the programs authorized in the earlier legislation.   The bill now under consideration is the Pentagon appropriationbill. As it worked on the measure late Wednesday, the Senate voted90-2 approval of an amendment which, in essence, added the earlierSenate version of the authorization bill.   When the Senate is finished, the entire matter will go to aHouse-Senate conference committee to work out differences betweenthe bill and the companion measure passed two months ago by theHouse.   The Senate appropriation bill includes $4 billion for theStrategic Defense Initiative, as Star Wars is formally known. Butthe Senate version of the authorization bill provides $4.6 billion.   The latter figure is closer to Reagan's original request of $4.8billion for SDI, which receives $3.9 billion in the current fiscalyear.   In addition, the Senate version does not have any of the armscontrol restrictions Reagan opposes.   The vote was part of a complicated legislative tactic to workout a defense spending compromise that Reagan will approve, Nunntold his colleagues.   ``Tonight, we begin the process of putting Humpty Dumpty backtogether again,'' Nunn told his colleagues. ``This may be missionimpossible, but I'm going to try.''   Reagan vetoed the defense bill despite the advice of DefenseSecretary Frank C. Carlucci and national security adviser ColinPowell, who both said it should be signed. They were involved inearlier negotiations with congressional leaders over thelegislation.   ``We need to have the executive branch sort out whom theCongress should work with on national security issues,'' said Nunn.``We have to know who's speaking for the administration. Can wedeal with the secretary of defense, can we deal with the nationalsecurity adviser?''</TEXT></DOC>
