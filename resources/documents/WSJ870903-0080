YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 09/03/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The number of bank failures is likely to go down in 1988 for the first time in seven years, according to the chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp.    &quot;We have good news,&quot; William Seidman said in announcing that the FDIC expects the number of bank failures next year to be at least 25% fewer than this year's projected post-Depression record of 200. A total of 120 federally insured banks have failed so far this year.    Mr. Seidman made his comments in an interview yesterday on NBC's &quot;Today&quot; show.    The projected decline reflects a stabilization in the economy of the Midwestern Farm Belt states, according to FDIC spokesman Stephen Katsanos. For instance, in Kansas, where 14 banks were closed last year, only three have failed so far this year. And in Iowa, where 10 banks failed last year, regulators have shut just five this year.    However, conditions in Southwestern states, whose economic health depends heavily on the energy industry, remain volatile. In Texas, for example, 36 banks have failed so far this year, already surpassing last year's figure of 26. In Oklahoma, where 16 banks failed in 1986, 22 have been shut already this year.    The FDIC's list of &quot;problem banks&quot; isn't growing as quickly as it did last year, either. In 1986, the list increased at a rate of nearly one bank a day, going from 1,098 at the end of 1985 to 1,457 at the end of 1986. In the first 240 days of 1987, however, the list grew by only 150 banks to stand at 1,607 on Aug. 28.    If Mr. Seidman's projection for 1988 holds true, next year would be the first since 1981 that bank failures haven't increased; in that year, only 10 banks failed.    The FDIC insures deposits of about $1.6 trillion held by more than 14,000 banks. </TEXT></DOC>
