On September 30, 1987, the Governmentof Israel requested in accordance with section 355.10 of the Commerce Regulationson administrative review of the order. We published the initiation on October20, 1987 (52 FR 38952). The Department has now conducted that administrativereview in accordance with section 751 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (``theTariff Act''). <ITAG tagnum="84">Scope of Review </ITAG>The United States, under the auspices of the Customs Cooperation Council,has developed a system of tariff classification based on the internationalharmonized system of Customs nomenclature. On January 1, 1989, the UnitedStates fully converted to the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) as providedfor in section 1201 et seq. of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Actof 1988. All merchandise entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumptionon or after that date is now classified solely according to the appropriateHTS item number(s). Imports covered by the review are shipments of Israeli fresh cut roses.During the review period, such merchandise was classified under item numbers192.1810 and 192.1890 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States Annotated.Such merchandise is currently classifiable under item number 0603.10.60of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule. The review covers the period October1, 1985 through September 30, 1986 and twelve programs. <ITAG tagnum="84">Analysis of Programs </ITAG>(1) Government-Guaranteed Minimum Price Program The Ministry of Agriculture (``MOA'') operates this program to guaranteea minimum price to farmers for their crops in case of bad marketing conditions.The MOA determines a national level of production to be covered by theguarantee program, sets a minimum (guaranteed) price based on export marketconditions, and pays 50 percent of the difference between the guaranteedprice and the actual average market price if the market price is lowerthan the guaranteed price. Payments are based on claims submitted to theMOA after the close of the growing season. Because these payments are available only to growers that export, we preliminarilydetermine that they are countervailable. We calculated the benefit fromthis program by dividing the total payments received for roses by the totalvalue of rose exports to all markets during the review period. On thisbasis, we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program to be 0.95percent <T3>ad valorem. </T3>(2) Export Promotion Financing FundThe MOA operates the Export Promotion Financing Fund to promote the developmentof export markets for Israeli agricultural products. Exporters submit proposalsto the MOA for promotional expenses, and the MOA determines whether toapprove the request based on the development potential for the productand the availability of funds. For proposals that are approved, exportersreceive reimbursements for up to 50 percent of actual expenses. We verifiedthat during the review period Agrexco, Bickel and Hillron received fundsfor the promotion of flowers to all markets.Because this program provides assistance only to exporters, we preliminarilydetermine that it is countervailable. To calculate the benefit, we dividedtotal payments received by each company by the value of its total flowerexports to all markets during the period of review. We then weight-averagedthe resulting benefits by each company's proportion of total rose exportsto the United States during the period of review. On this basis, we preliminarilydetermine the benefit from this program to be 0.14 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>At verification, we found that the Export Promotion Committee had renouncedfunding of promotional activities for flowers exported to the United States,and that no funds had been budgeted for the 1987/88 growing season forthe promotion of flowers in the U.S. market. Therefore, for purposes ofcash deposit of estimated countervailing duties, we preliminarily determinethe benefit from this program to be zero.(3) Insurance From Israel Foreign Trade Risks Insurance Corporation (IFTRIC)The Exchange Rate Risks Insurance Scheme (``EIS''), which is operated byIFTRIC, insures exporters against losses occurring when the rate of devaluationof the shekel does not keep pace with the rate of inflation. If the rateof inflation is higher than the rate of devaluation, the exporter is compensatedin an amount equal to the difference between the two rates multiplied bythe value added by each exporter to the exported merchandise.In determining whether an export insurance program provides a countervailablebenefit, we examine whether the premiums and other charges are adequateto cover the program's long-term operating costs and losses. We determinedin the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Certain FreshCut Flowers from Israel </T3>(``Flowers'') (52 FR 3316, February 3, 1987)that this program conferred a countervailable benefit on exports of cutflowers from Israel because the EIS operated at a loss in the five yearsfrom 1981 through 1985, and that five years is a sufficiently long periodto establish that the premiums and other charges are inadequate to coverthe long-term operating costs and losses of the program.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Based on this determination, we preliminarily determine that thisprogram is countervailable.We calculated the benefit from this program by dividing the amount of compensationeach company received by the value of its total flower exports to all marketsduring the period of review. We then weight-averaged the resulting benefitsby each company's proportion of total rose exports to the United Statesduring the period of review. On this basis, we preliminarily determinethe benefit from this program to be 9.18 percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>(4) Short-Term Fuel Advances to Rose GrowersIn 1982, the Israeli Institute for Farm Research published a survey onthe profitability of rose production in the 1980/81 season. This studystated that gross income for rose growers included grants for fuel expensesand interest savings on low-cost credit. In past reviews, we determinedon the basis of best information available that these grants conferreda countervailable benefit.At verification, we found that on December 12, 1980, the MOA had disbursedshort-term interest-free loans or advances to four rose growers for thepurchase of fuel. Three of the four growers repaid their fuel advancesbefore the current review period. The remaining grower had an outstandingdebt balance for fuel advances during the review period. We consider thebalance outstanding during the review period to be a short-term interest-freeloan. To calculate the benefit, we used as our benchmark the nominal annualshort-term commercial interest rate for Israeli shekels, as published inthe Bank of Israel Annual Report. We then allocated the total interestsavings over total rose production during the review period. On this basis,we preliminarily determine the benefit from this program to be 0.32 percent<T3>ad valorem.</T3>(5) Government Funding of Agrexco and Purchase of Agrexco SharesIn 1978/79 and 1979/80, the MOA provided funds to Agrexco specificallyto finance the expansion of Agrexco's air freight terminal at Ben GurionAirport. In past administrative reviews, we determined on the basis ofthe best information available that these funds were grants and, therefore,countervailable. In the current administrative review, we verified thatthese government funds to Agrexco consisted of government purchases ofshares in the company.When Agrexco was established in 1957, the Israeli government purchased50 percent of the company's founders (voting) shares. From 1957 through1979, the purchase of all subsequent issues of nonvoting (ordinary) shareswas equally split between government and nongovernment entities (<T3>i.e, </T3> growers and producer organizations). Between 1980 and 1982,the government's percentage of new shares purchased dropped slightly below50 percent and then substantially declined in 1983 and 1984. All sharesissued in 1985 and 1986 were purchased entirely by nongovernment investors.However, Agrexco remains 50 percent government-controlled because no newvoting shares have been issued since Agrexco's founding.Agrexco is a nonprofit company that acts as a seller, marketer and distributorof all types of Israeli agricultural products. While precluded from makinga profit, Agrexco always covers its operating costs. If Agrexco had surplusfunds in any one year, the company may redistribute such funds to the growersand producer organizations that are shareholders. Agrexco does not paydividends to its shareholders, and shares may be sold by individual investorsonly at the normal share value (original purchase price).We have consistently held that government equity ownership <T3>per se</T3> does not confer a subsidy. Government ownership confersa subsidy only when it is on terms inconsistent with commercial considerations.When a government and private investors purchase shares in a company atthe same price, we normally do not consider such government provision ofcapital to confer a subsidy. In this case, however, both government andprivate investors paid the same price for Agrexco shares, but with differentprospects.Producer organizations and growers invest in Agrexco with the expectationof benefiting from the use of Agrexco's export facilities and services.Most growers are too small to export on their own.The growers' ability to export and the profits from those export salesconstitute the ``return'' on their investment in Agrexco.The Israeli government, on the other hand, could anticipate no such benefitbecause it does not use the services of the company (<T3>i.e.,</T3> Agrexco's export facilities). Moreover, the Israeli governmentcould not expect any return on its investment either from dividends oran increase in the value of Agrexco's shares (because the shares can onlybe sold at their nominal value). In effect, the rate of return for thenonuser investor is always zero. Thus, the purchase of shares in Agrexcoby the Israeli government cannot be considered a reasonable commercialinvestment. We preliminarily determine that the government's purchasesof Agrexco shares were inconsistent with commercial considerations and,therefore, countervailable.For commercially unreasonable equity infusions, we normally apply our ``rateof return shortfall'' methodology (a comparison of the company's rate ofreturn on equity with the national average rate of return on equity). Sucha methodology, however, is inappropriate when applied to a nonprofit companysuch as Agrexco. Absent the possibility of earning a rate of return, theIsraeli government's ownership of shares in Agrexco does not fit the normalcharacteristics of equity. Because the Israeli government has held theseshares, some of them for more than 30 years, without receiving any returnor exercising any claim on them, the benefit somewhat resembles a grant.On the other hand, the benefit to Agrexco is not truly a grant becausethe Israeli government still has a claim on Agrexco and could redeem theshares.As a practical matter, however, we note that the amount of benefit fromany program can be no greater than if the program were an outright grant.Were we to consider this program a grant, our allocation period would bethe average useful life of agricultural assets according to the ``AssetGuideline Classes'' of the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (which is 10 years),and our declining balance grant methodology would yield a benefit of 0.0006percent <T3>ad valorem.</T3>Because this maximum possible benefit has an inconsequential effect onthe total bounty or grant to Agrexco (because we carry out the countervailingduty rate to only two decimal places), we believe it is unnecessary todetermine the methodology that would be more appropriate for calculatingthe benefit to Agrexco from the Israeli government's ownership of sharesin Agrexco. Therefore, for purposes of these preliminary results, our calculationof the total bounty or grant does not include the benefit from this program.(6) Government Support of the Flower Board of IsraelThe Flower Board of Israel (``FBI'') was established by the OrnamentalPlants Production and Marketing Board Law of 1976. The FBI is appointedby the Israeli Cabinet acting through the Ministers of Agriculture andCommerce and Industry.In the final determination on Flowers, we determined, on the basis of bestinformation available, that the Government of Israel provided financialsupport to the FBI and that such financial support is countervailable.At verification, we found that beginning in the 1985/86 growing season,the government no longer funds the FBI. On this basis, we preliminarilydetermine that this program is not countervailable.(7) Rebate of Export Insurance PremiumsThis program, which was administered by IFTRIC, operated to rebate insurancepremiums to exporters. At verification, we established that this programwas terminated on June 1, 1985, and that no claims for rebates of premiumswere accepted after that date. Therefore, we preliminarily determine thatthere were no countervailable benefits received under this program.(8) Long-Term Industrial Development Loans to AgrexcoAgrexco received four long-term industrial development loans which hadoutstanding balances during the review period. In the <T3>Final Affirmative Countervailing Duty Determination: Industrial PhosphoricAcid from Israel</T3> (52 FR 25448; July 7, 1987), we determined that long-termindustrial development loans are countervailable only to the extent thatthe applicable interest rates are less than those on loans to companieslocated in the Central Zone (<T3>i.e.</T3>, the heavily populated and developed zone). Because Agrexcois located in the Central Zone, it paid the highest rate charged for long-termloans at that time. Therefore, we preliminarily determine that these loansto Agrexco are not countervailable.(9) Other ProgramsIn past reviews, we found that the programs listed below conferred countervailablebenefits on the basis of best information available. In the final determinationon Flowers (which covered the same period of review and the same companies),we found that these programs were not countervailable. Therefore, we didnot reinvestigate the following programs in this review:1.

The Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to assess countervailingduties of 10.59 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on all shipments ofthis merchandise exported on or after October 1, 1985 and on or beforeSeptember 30, 1986. Further, due to the elimination of the Export Promotion Financing Fund,the Department intends to instruct the Customs Service to collect a cashdeposit of estimated countervailing duties, as provided by section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act, of 10.45 percent of the f.o.b. invoice price on allshipments of Israeli fresh cut roses entered, or withdrawn from warehouse,for consumption on or after the date of publication of the final resultsof this administrative review. Interested parties may submit written comments on these preliminary resultswithin 30 days of the date of publication of this notice and may requestdisclosure and/or a hearing within 10 days of the date of publication.Any hearing, if requested, will be held 30 days after the date of publicationor the following workday. Any request for an administrative protectiveorder must be made no later than 5 days after the date of publication.The Department will publish the final results of this administrative reviewincluding the results of its analysis of issues raised in any such writtencomments or at a hearing. This administrative review and notice are in accordance with section 751(a)(1)of the Tariff Act (19 U.S.C. 1675(a)(1)) and andSection; 355.22 of the CommerceRegulations published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 27, 1988 (53 FR 53206) (to be codifiedat 19 CFR 355.22).<ITAG tagnum="6">Jan W.
