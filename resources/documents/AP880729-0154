Everett Koop on Fridayrenewed his call for the nation to escalate the battle againstsmoking with the same fervor it devotes to illicit drugs, and heassailed a new smokeless cigarette as ``a drug in acigarette-shaped dispenser.''   Koop and other anti-smoking witnesses told Congress that theFood and Drug Administration should regulate any sales of the``smokeless cigarette'' being developed by the R.J. ReynoldsTobacco Co., even though the agency does not have jurisdiction overregular tobacco products.   The surgeon general noted that ``Our nation has mobilizedenormous resources to wage a war on drugs _ illicit drugs. Weshould also give priority to the one addiction _ tobacco addiction_ that is killing more than 300,000 Americans each year.''   Koop, as he has previously, declared that tobacco is asaddictive as cocaine and heroin. And he told a House subcommitteethat the FDA should regulate any sales of the so-called smokelesscigarette because it ``contains nicotine, which is a drug in acigarette-shaped dispenser.''   Koop testified to the House Energy and Commerce subcommittee onhealth and the environment about the 618-page, anti-smoking reporthe issued in May. ``Careful examination of the data,'' he said,``makes it clear that cigarettes and other forms of tobacco areaddicting. An extensive body of research has shown that nicotine isthe drug in tobacco that causes addiction.''   Charles O. Whitley, representing the Tobacco Institute, said theFDA barely has the resources to carry out its current dutieswithout adding tobacco products to its jurisdiction. He also saidKoop's report ``is a political document.''   ``Its conclusions conform with the Surgeon General's politicalgoal of a smokeless society, and undoubtedly were reached longbefore the report was drafted,'' Whitley said.   R.J. Reynolds announced last September that it would market thesmokeless cigarette, which contains tobacco. Unlike othercigarettes, the company says, it heats but does not burn thetobacco to deliver the nicotine.   Several organizations, including the American LungAssociation,the American Cancer Society and the American MedicalAssociation, have petitioned the FDA to take jurisdiction over theproposed product by classifying it a drug.   Several bills have been introduced in Congress to give the FDAauthority to regulate the proposed cigarette.   Currently most regulation of tobacco products is administered bythe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in the TreasuryDepartment and the Federal Trade Commission. The FDA has authorityover food products, drugs, medical devices and cosmetics.   FDA Commissioner Frank E. Young told the House subcommittee theagency is reviewing the petitions against the smokeless cigarette``to determine whether this product should be regulated under theFDC (Food, Drug and Cosmetic) Act.''   ``One can see that the agency must attempt to differentiatebetween the traditional tobacco product, marketed without medicalclaims, and therefore not regulated by FDA, and the newerinnovations designed to deliver nicotine to satisfy nicotinedependence or otherwise to affect the structure or function of thebody,'' he said.   Gregory R. Connolly, representing the American Public HealthAssociation, said that if R.J. Reynolds is serious about producinga safer product, ``I suggest they voluntarily submit the device tothe FDA for safety and efficacy testing as a new therapeutic agentto help smokers quit.   ``If they refuse to do so then it is a clear signal that theproduct is meant to improve the corporate health of R.J. Reynoldsand not the health of the American public,'' he said.   Connolly said the association urges the FDA to regulate thecigarette as it would any other drug delivery device.   Scott Ballin, representing the Coalition on Smoking OR Health,said the FDA already has sufficient legal authority and power toregulate both cigarettes and new alternative nicotine deliveryproducts. ``The failure of the Food and Drug Administration toassert this authority will inevitably and unnecessarily furtherjeopardize the health and safety of the American public,'' he said.   Richard M. Cooper, an attorney representing R.J. ReynoldsTobacco Co., said the FDA has no basis to assert control over theproposed smokeless product, which he said will receive furthertesting by the company before it is marketed.   Cooper said the law covers a product's use, but not itscharacteristics.   ``Thus, cigarettes, cigars, and other tobacco-containingarticles marketed for smoking pleasure, and other articles marketedfor smoking pleasure _ without therapeutic claims _ simply are notdrugs or devices, under the general interpretation by FDA and thecourts of the relevant provisions of the Food, Drug and CosmeticAct,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
