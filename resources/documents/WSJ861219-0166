For Mr. Wilson and his designers, a &quot;tech&quot; rehearsal is a very perilous moment. Wilson visuals are not there to support the text. They are the text. They must be perfect.    For the opening image, horizontal shafts of light from both sides of the stage strike the hand of a kneeling woman, a hand she holds dramatically in front of her face. Mr. Wilson stood watching the effect from the center aisle, about halfway up. &quot;Stop,&quot; he bellowed, when lights from the orchestra pit came on a moment too soon and spoiled the sudden illumination of the hand. Soon the rehearsal resumed, punctuated every few minutes by one of Mr. Wilson's shouts.    &quot;We never talk in terms of ideas,&quot; says Beverly Emmons, Mr. Wilson's lighting designer. &quot;If you ask him what something means, you don't get an answer that means anything. Bob is a visual artist. The reason for making any decision one way or another is based entirely on how the thing looks.&quot;    &quot;Bob's shows are staged so that they can be lit the way he needs them lit,&quot; says Tom Kamm, who shares a scenic design credit with Mr. Wilson. &quot;You rarely find actors crossing upstage/downstage; they usually pass laterally across the stage. And people are separated in planes so that they can be individually lit.&quot;    In the case of the dancers featured in Scene A, Mr. Wilson's unorthodox lighting caused a rather large problem: temporary blindness. &quot;Bob wants the floor lit separately,&quot; explains Ms. Emmons. &quot;He wants each dancer to be 10 times as bright as the floor. So the lights coming from the side blind the dancers.&quot; During the tech rehearsal three of the dancers descend from the stage to object, heatedly. Mr. Wilson remains unruffled, and eventually it is decided that the lights on the dancers will be lowered 10%, restoring some of the dancers' vision and still allowing Mr. Wilson the glittering figures he wants.    For Ms. Emmons, who shares her lighting credit with Mr. Wilson -- something she does with none of her other theater or dance world collaborators -- working on a Robert Wilson piece allows her both less and more authority as a theater artist. &quot;Bob never asks my opinion,&quot; says Ms. Emmons. &quot;He's not interested in whether I think the scene should be green or yellow or blue. That's his decision to make. That's part of the deal. One therefore becomes a super tech. My concerns become, 'What is that little wiggly thing over there?' and 'What causes that ripple on the floor?'&quot;    On the other hand, the manifold importance of getting the light right gives Ms. Emmons a freedom she would not otherwise enjoy. &quot;If Bob doesn't like the lighting, the entire Opera House will come to a screeching halt while we fix whatever needs fixing,&quot; she says. &quot;That gives me incredible power. I can go to the producer and say, 'I need this and if I don't get it everything else gets held up.' No other director cares as much about lighting as Bob does. And in order for us to make all the right decisions about these super-tech things, the artistic parts of ourselves have to fuse with Bob's vision. We have to understand in a nonverbal way what it is he's trying to accomplish.&quot;    Indeed, Mr. Wilson's sensibility is intrinsically nonverbal, in an eerily literal way. His art, he says, was shaped early on by the thinking of two people: a deaf-mute man who knew no words, and a 13-year-old mentally handicapped boy. The success of any Robert Wilson piece depends not on the impassive masks of his actor's faces, the virtually incoherent text, or on Philip Glass's powerful music, but on the ability of his designers to realize the nonsensical, mesmerizing images that he sketches for them.    Often these images come from photographs (much of &quot;the CIVIL warS&quot; was inspired by the American Civil War photography of Matthew Brady) but sometimes, according to Ms. Emmons, Mr. Wilson has no idea from where the images come. That too becomes irrelevant to the people who must constantly reinvent stagecraft in order to translate Mr. Wilson's teeming visions into theater.    Here are the program notes describing some of what takes place in Scene C of the Rome Section: &quot;In an empty landscape, Hercules climbs down a ladder descending from the sky . . . While he starts to wander across the stage, an endless procession of trees from all over the world begins to cross upstage . . . Meanwhile, through the trees, another spaceship becomes visible, Mrs. Lincoln at the porthole, this time as a young girl.&quot;    The physical problem of constructing &quot;an endless procession of trees&quot; that moves with the exact degree of fluidity Mr. Wilson had envisioned is a puzzle that Mr. Kamm and others had to solve. The solution -- that the trees are painted on muslin and then sewn onto a gauze scrim that is pulled across the stage on a curtain-tracking system -- is sometimes less work than the actual manipulation of the machinery, night after night. &quot;In order to do it, we have to turn the crew into performers; and they work every bit as hard as any one on stage,&quot; says Mr. Kamm. &quot;It's much more work than any of them are used to. But once they understand it, they get hooked.&quot;    &quot;They are intrigued,&quot; adds Ms. Emmons, &quot;because never has the technical mattered so much. In other productions you kill yourself to make a chair and the director will just throw it out if they cut the line about the chair. In this piece the chair is what it's all about. Or the way the chair is lit. This production demands so much of the stagehands and so much of the electricians that it makes them into artists. They love it because it honors their skill.&quot;    ---   Ms. Winer is a New York-based freelance writer. </TEXT></DOC>
