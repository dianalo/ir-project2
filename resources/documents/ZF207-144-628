(products).andO;Product:   Lap-Link Plus 2.16 (Utility program).andO;Topic:     File TransferUtility ProgramsSoftware PackagesEvaluation.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Lap-Link Plus You can guess from Lap-Link Plus's name that its purpose is toconnect laptop computers to desktop machines.andP;  The original Lap-Linkconcentrated on file transfer and file management only.andP;  The $139.95 Lap-LinkPlus package is actually a combination of the Lap-Link program and Lap-LinkPlus, a device-oriented program that lets you control another computer'sdrives and use its printer.andP;  You can still buy Lap-Link alone for $129.95,but since the complete package costs only $10 more, it makes sense to investin Lap-Link Plus.andM;Each program comes with its own manuals, and each has its own installationprocedures.andP;  Both programs communicate between computers via an includeddouble-headed 9-pin and 25-pin connector serial cable.andM;Installing Lap-Link is easy: just copy the LL.EXE file from the distributiondisks to each computer.andP;  Lap-Link Plus's installation is a little morecomplicated and it modifies your CONFIG.SYS file, but you shouldn't run intoany difficulties getting it up and running.andM;In Lap-Link, the connected computers display a split screen showing whatfiles are on each.andP;  You can control the file transfer process from eithermachine, switching the lead quickly.andP;  Convenience features included withLap-Link are a graphic directory display; subdirectory control; file sortingby name, extension, size, and date; and file tagging for batch copying orerasing.andP;  A Copy Newer Files feature lets you avoid copying unmodified orolder versions of files.andP;  The most striking feature of Lap-Link, though, isits logical menu structure.andP;  Unless you want to get fancy, you can just loadthe program and run it with little recourse to the manual.andM;Running Lap-Link Plus is also easy, but the program doesn't resemble Lap-Linkmuch.andP;  The major difference is that Lap-Link Plus requires you to set up amaster/slave relationship in which one computer is the lead and the other apassive host whose drives and printers are subject to the command of the leadcomputer.andP;  You run the DD.EXE program on the slave computer; this displays astatus screen that informs you of the communications parameters being usedand tells you when the link with the lead computer is active.andM;With Lap-Link Plus invoked on the lead computer, you can still operate in DOSor in your normal application programs; the difference is that now you haveaccess to the slave computer's disk drives and printer.andP;  The drive names onthe remote machine are referred to as the next letter after yourhighest-named drive.andP;  For example, if you have a floppy drive A: and a harddrive C: on a lead PC hooked up to a passive-slave desktop computer that alsohas a floppy drive A: and a hard drive C:, you would refer to the slave'sdrives as D: and E: in order to access its files and run its programs fromthe lead machine.andP;  Often this functional joining obviates the need fortransferring data files in the first place.andP;  The connection also means thatall print commands issued at the lead PC go directly to a printer hooked upto the desktop slave.andM;Lap-Link Plus isn't a true networking product, since it can't run bothcomputers at the same time, but the enhanced file and printer sharing itoffers make this method of device connection a very attractive alternative,especially in docking situations, where a host desktop lends its drives andprinter to a laptop.andM;In our performance tests, we used Lap-Link's turbo-mode option to use biggerblocks for data transfer.andP;  Compared with the other products, especially theparallel port transfer software, Lap-Link's times were average.andP;  Lap-Link (aswell as other programs operating in serial mode) takes about twice as long totransfer 100K and 1MB files as do the parallel port programs.andM;The biggest disappointment with the Lap-Link Plus combination of products isthe lack of a script language or macro facility.andP;  You can automate filetransfer with DOS batch files using Lap-Link Plus, but we expect more thanbatch files from a full-priced market leader.andM;Lap-Link Plus is very simple to use for file transfer operations and forsetting up temporary master/slave relationships between computers in order toshare drives.andP;  It works well and has several convenient features, but it isshowing its age a bit.andP;  To bring it up to date, it needs improved speed, amacro capability, and better integration of the two very separate products.andO;The way it stands now, it's most useful for laptop users on the move.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
