We will continue to promote measures in order to removeinefficiencies in our economies. These inefficiencies affect manyaspects of economic activity, reduce potential growth rates and theprospects for job creation, diminish the effectiveness ofmacroeconomic policies and impede the external adjustment process.   In this context, tax reforms, modernization of financial markets,strengthening of competition policies and reducing rigidities in allsectors including energy, industry and agriculture are necessary. Soare the improvement of education and vocational training,transportation and distribution systems and further policies aimedat giving more flexibility and mobility to the labor market andreducing unemployment.   Within the European Community, the steady progress towardcompletion by the end of 1992 of the program contained in the SingleAct has already given a strong momentum to economic efficiency.   15. The decline of saving in some of our countries in this decadeis a cause of concern. This lower level of saving can contribute tohigh real interest rates and therefore hamper growth. Inadequatesaving and large fiscal deficits are associated with large externaldeficits. We recommend, within the frameweork of policycoordination, policies to encourage saving and remove hinderanceswhere they exist.   16. Financial activities are being increasingly carried out withnew techniques on a worldwide basis. As regards insider trading,which could hamper the credibility of financial markets, regulationsvary greatly among our countries. These regulations have beenrecently, or are in the process of being, strengthened.International cooperation should be pursued and enhanced.</TEXT><NOTE>TRADE ISSUES</NOTE><TEXT>   17. World trade developed rapidly last year. Yet protectionismremains a real threat. We strongly reaffirm our determination tofight it in all its forms.   We shall fulfill the Punta de Este standstill and rollbackcommitments which, inter alia, require the avoidance of any traderestrictive or distorting measure inconsistent with the provisionsof the General Agreement and its instruments.   We agree to make effective use of the improved GATT disputesettlement mechanism and to make progress in negotiations forfurther improvements. We will avoid any discriminatory or autonomousactions, which undermined the principles of the GATT and theintegrity of the multilateral trading system.   We also are pledged to oppose the tendency toward unilateralism,bilateralism, sectoralism and managed trade which threatens toundermine the multilateral system and Uruguay Round negotiations.   18. The successful negotiation of the Trade NegotiationsCommittee of the Uruguay Round in Geneva last April, therebycompleting the midterm review, is a very important achievement. Itgives a clear framework for future work in all sectors including thepursuit of agricultural reform in the short term as well as in thelong term. It also gives the necessary framework for substantivenegotiations in important sectors not yet fully included in GATTdisciplines, such as services, trade-related investment measures andintellectural property.   Developed countries participated actively in these negotiationsand contributed to this success. All countries should make theirmost constructive contribution possible.   We express our full commitment to making further substantiveprogress in the Uruguay Round in order to complete it by the end of1990.   19. We note with satisfaction the entry into force of the FreeTrade Agreeement betwen Canada and the United States, as well asmore recent initiatives to intensify the close economic relationsbetween the European Community and EFTA countries. It remains ourpolicy that these and other developments in regional cooperation,should be trade-creating and complementary to the multilateralliberalization process.   20. It is the firm intention of the European Community that thetrade aspects of the single market program should also betrade-creating and complementary to the multilateral liberalizationprocess.   21. We note with satisfaction the progress that has been made instrengthening the multilateral disciplines on trade and aiddistorting export credit subsidies. This effort must be pursuedactively and completed in the competent bodies of the OECD with aview to improving present guidelines at the earliest possible date.</TEXT><NOTE>GENERAL PROBLEMS OF DEVELOPMENT</NOTE><TEXT>   22. Development is a shared global challenge. We shall helpdeveloping countries by opening the world trading system and bysupporting their structural adjustment. We shall encourage too,economic diversification in commodity dependent countries and thecreation of a favorable environment for transfers of technology andcapital flows.   We underline the continuing importance of official developmentassistance and welcome the increased efforts of summit participantsin this respect. We note the targets already established byinternational organizations for the future level of officialdevelopment assistance and stress the importance of overallfinancial flows to devlopment.   We underline simultaneously the importance attached to thequality of the aid and to the evaluation of the projects andprograms financed.   23. We urge developing countries to implement sound economicpolicies. A vital factor will be the adoption of financial andfiscal policies which attract inward investment and encourage growthand the return of flight capital.   24. We note with satisfaction that there has been substantialprogress in the multilateral aid initiative for the Philippines thatwas given special attention in the Toronto economic declaration.   25. Faced with the worrying economic situation of Yugoslavia, weencourage its government to implement a strong economic reformsprogram that can command bilateral and multilateral support.</TEXT><NOTE>THE SITUATION IN THE POOREST COUNTRIES</NOTE><TEXT>   26. The enhancement of the International Monetary Fund StructuralAdjustment Facility, the World Bank special program of assistancefor the poorest and most indebted countries and the fifthreplenishment of the African Development Fund are all importantmeasures benefiting those countries having embarked upon anadjustment process.
