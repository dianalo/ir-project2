A variety of technologies have resultedsuch as computer cartography, image processing, spatial modeling, computergraphics, data base management, and geographic information systems. Thesetools have been used in a wide range of spatial applications involvingfacility siting, transportation routing, coal resource analysis, environmentalimpacts, terrain modeling, inventory development, demographic studies,water resource analyses, etc. The report discusses a number of topicsdealing with geographic data bases and structures, software and processingtechniques, hardware systems, models and analysis tools, data acquisitiontechniques, and graphical display methods. Numerous results from manydifferent applications are shown to aid the reader interested in usinggeographic information systems for environmental analyses. 15 refs.,64 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
