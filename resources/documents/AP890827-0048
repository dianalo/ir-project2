(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Voyager 2's close-up photos of Neptune'smoon Triton reveal what look like active ice volcanoes that eruptexplosively, spewing nitrogen ice particles and gas nearly 20 mileshigh, scientists said Sunday.   ``I believe they are active,'' or erupted at least within thepast 100 years, said U.S. Geological Survey geologist LarrySoderblom, a member of the Voyager photographic imaging team atNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. ``There's 10 or 20 or 30 _ lots.''   ``This is a crazy idea ... but it's the best we have at thecurrent time'' to explain the pockmarked terrain, he added.   While more evidence is needed to prove the volcanoes are active,``the whole process makes physical sense,'' said Bradford Smith,leader of the Voyager 2 imaging team. ``That is a perfectly sensibleexplanation.''   If Soderblom and Smith are right, Triton is only the third objectin the solar system known to have active volcanism. Earth andJupiter's moon Io are the others.   Soderblom compared the new type of ice volcanoes withsulfur-spewing volcanoes on Io. But he said the volcanoes on Tritonare produced when liquid nitrogen rises in underground pools risesto the surface, where reduced pressure means ``it's got to explodeand will shower ice particles and gas.''   Based on dark-colored, plume-shaped deposits that stretch up to50 miles downwind from the volcanoes, Soderblom estimated theeruptions eject debris at scores of mile per hour, perhaps faster,sending it 12 to 19 miles skyward.   ``The stuff comes shooting up like gas out of a gun barrel,''said Smith, a University of Arizona planetary scientist. Thedeposits apparently contain radiation-darkened ices that fell to thesurface after being carried skyward by the blast, he added.   Voyager 2 made its closest approach to Neptune on Thursday nightwhen it skimmed about 3,000 miles over the planet's north pole cloudtops. Early Friday morning, the spacecraft zoomed about 24,000 milespast Triton, taking the photos that have revealed at least threekinds of icy volcanism on the moon.   Voyager earlier discovered icy flows that oozed up from thefloors of long valleys, a process likened to toothpaste coming outof a tube slit with a razor blade.   On Friday, scientists announced that Voyager had discovered adifferent type of ice volcanoes, which appeared inactive andpossibly extinct. They are huge flat craters, called calderas,similar to the one in which Yellowstone National Park rests.   Some calderas, such as the crater atop Hawaii's Kilauea volcano,fill with lava lakes. Triton's calderas, measuring up to hundreds ofmiles wide, fill with flows of viscous ice, possibly water ice, thatgushes up from below, Smith said.   New evidence released Sunday shows Triton's ice-lava lakes ``cancome up and overflow. You see that happen in Hawaii all the time''when molten rock lava overflows crater walls, Smith said.   So eruptions from Triton's calderas once produced ``a sea ofice-like lava in repeated eruptions,'' resulting in ``massive,oceanic-scale flooding,'' Soderblom said during a Sunday newsconference. He said at least four such calderas have been spotted onTriton.   Soderblom said he believes the newly discovered nitrogen icevolcanoes either are currently active or erupted within the pastcentury because they are located on Triton's huge south polar icecap.   A year on Neptune and Triton lasts about 165 Earth years. So ifthe ice cap had gone through a summer, evidence of volcanic depositswould have been erased as the ice cap receded, he added.   So far, Voyager has discovered six moons orbiting Neptune, inaddition to Triton and Nereid, which were discovered from Earth. Italso has found five rings of debris orbiting the planet, includingtwo that are broad bands of dust.   The latest ring photo released by NASA Sunday shows one of thosebands is even broader than thought, forming a beautiful, circularsheet of dust that extends throughout the plane of Neptune's ringsand extends inward toward the planet.   NASA's latest results from Voyager's close encounters withNeptune and Triton found that:   _Winds up to more than 700 mph have been measured in Neptune'satmosphere.   _A day on Neptune lasts 16 hours and three minutes, give or takefour minutes.   _Neptune's south pole and equator, while incredibly cold, aremuch hotter than the planet's middle latitudes.   _The planet's magnetic poles are tilted an extreme 50 degreesaway from from the poles around which the planet rotates, a muchgreater tilt than the minimum of 30 degrees scientists initiallyestimated. That means Neptune's magnetic north pole is closer to itsequator than to its rotational north pole.   It also means Neptune is much more similar to Uranus, which has amagnetic field tilt of 58 degrees. Earth's magnetic poles are tilted12 degrees from its true, or rotational poles.   By 9 a.m. PDT Monday, Voyager will be 2.76 billion miles fromEarth and 3.19 million miles behind Neptune, speeding away from theplanet at 37,621 mph.   The probe on Sunday was looking for lightning and auroras onTriton. It also sent back its best picture of heart-shaped moon1989N1, which has usurped Nereid as Neptune's second-largest moon.</TEXT></DOC>
