Negotiators, still divided over whether to impose new taxes onthe wealthy and other issues, planned to meet through the weekendif necessary in hopes of agreeing to a package. Congress planned arare Sunday session to deal with the fiscal crisis.   More than four months of talks have brought tentative agreementsto cut defense and domestic programs and raise the government'stake on items ranging from gasoline to Medicare premiums, officialsfamiliar with the talks said Thursday.   But at nearly 1:30 a.m. today, negotiators broke for the eveningsaying they could not yet shake hands on a pact.   ``So close and yet we're not quite there,'' said House MinorityLeader Robert Michel, R-Ill., as he and other bargainers endedtheir back-room meeting in the Capitol.   The major question remained whether Democrats would finallyagree to a reduction in the capital gains tax - a longtime demandof President Bush - and which levies on the wealthy would beboosted to compensate.   ``We're still working on all of that,'' said House BudgetCommittee Chairman Leon Panetta, D-Calif.   Without a budget deal, federal drug agents, food and druginspectors and many of the government's 2.1 million civilianworkers faced furloughs beginning Monday.   The lack of an agreement would trigger $85 billion in spendingcuts. Social Security, soldiers' salaries and many initiatives forthe poor are exempted, but most federal programs faced immediatebudget slashes of about one-third.   At the talks, Republicans were willing to abandon thepresident's insistence to lower the rates of the capital gains tax,which is charged against the profits of property sales, officialssaid.   Instead, they were willing to leave current rates alone andexempt from the levy increases in the value of an asset due toinflation.   But insistent that most benefits of the tax cut would go to thewealthy, Democrats were holding out for a counter-balancing taxincrease on the well-to-do.   Several options were under consideration, including raising taxrates on the richest Americans and limiting their deductions.   A rate increase would represent a significant political victoryfor Democrats over Bush, whose 1988 campaign is best remembered forhis chant of ``No new taxes.''   The two sides have tentatively agreed to hold defense spendingto $170 billion below the amount it would need to stay even withinflation over the next five years, including a $10 billion cutnext year.   The growth of benefit programs would be slowed by $120 billion,half of it coming from Medicare.   Participants in the program, which provides health care to 33million elderly and disabled people, would bear half the cuts. Muchof the savings would come from a $5.70 increase in the $28.60payment they make monthly for doctors' coverage. Doctors andhospitals would have to swallow the other half of the Medicarereductions.   Over five years, support payments to farmers would be cut $12billion and benefits for civil servants would drop by $14 billion.   Although not yet agreed to, it appeared likely that SocialSecurity recipients would be hit for $20 billion in savings, eitherby having cost-of-living increases delayed or the taxes on theirbenefits increased.   Tax increases tentatively set were an 8-cent-per-gallon increasein the federal gasoline levy, already at 9 cents; a separate tax onall fuels based on their energy content; and a 10 percent tax onluxury items including yachts, furs and jewelry.   Democrats would like to boost the income tax rate on thewealthiest Americans above its current 28 percent. People who falljust below the top bracket must pay taxes of 33 percent, andDemocrats would like to increase the top rate to at least 31percent, officials said.   As an alternative, they are considering a plan limiting thedeductions people who earn above $100,000 can claim to 90 or 95percent of what they would otherwise be entitled.   Democrats also have proposed lifting the earnings ceiling abovewhich Medicare taxes are not taken out of paychecks.   As part of Social Security withholding, people now pay a 1.45percent tax to support Medicare on earnings up to $51,300 per year.They pay nothing on money they earn above that amount. Under theproposal, that ceiling would be lifted to $65,000 or $75,000.</TEXT></DOC>
