Thousand Trails, a Bellevue, Wash., owner of campgrounds in the U.S. and Canada, said the Dallas-based real estate concern will buy 2.4 million Thousand Trails shares from Western Savings andamp; Loan Assn. of Phoenix, Ariz., and will assume Thousand Trails debt of about $87.5 million held by the thrift. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Thousand Trails closed at $3.50 a share, up 56.25 cents.    Thousand Trails will then exchange as much as $70 million of the debt for about 14.8 million shares to be issued. The remaining debt will be exchanged for receivables held by Thousand Trails.    Thousand Trails in January shed assets to pare its long-term debt. It recently said it had deferred $4.2 million in interest payments on certain bank notes until it could work out a restructuring plan. For the six months ended June 30, Thousand Trails had revenue of $41.9 million and a net loss of $8 million.    The agreement is subject to Thousand Trails restructuring other existing debt, Southmark said. In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, Southmark was unchanged at $9.625 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
