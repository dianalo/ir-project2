The trades were carried out by several Swiss banks as well as by concerns apparently based in other countries, including Liberia, Panama and the Bahamas. The trading was referred to the SEC by the New York Stock Exchange as warranting investigation for being contemporaneous with trading in Carter Hawley by Mr. Levine before an important announcement about the company was made.    Mr. Levine, using the Bahamas office of Bank Leu, a Swiss bank, made illegal profits of about $220,000 from trading in Carter Hawley before Limited Inc. announced a hostile tender offer for the retail company in April 1984.    The Big Board's referral to the SEC is mentioned in a draft of a report on insider trading compiled by the General Accounting Office at the request of Rep. John Dingell's (D., Mich.) Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.    The as-yet unreleased report, which reviews the current regulatory system of detecting and investigating insider trading, uses the Carter Hawley matter to point out the difficulty of pursuing insider trading by offshore accounts. The GAO report doesn't mention the company by name, but several sources in New York and Washington confirmed that Carter Hawley is the stock in question.    Gary Lynch, the SEC's enforcement director; Charles Staigor, the author of the GAO report; and a spokeswoman for the New York Stock Exchange all declined to comment.    Several people familiar with the Big Board's referral to the SEC cautioned that pre-announcement trading by offshore accounts isn't necessarily shady trading. One person said that a Swiss bank could trade the stock to engage in legitimate risk arbitrage. But all questioned on the matter agreed that the sheer number of offshore entities trading before the announcement of a tender offer at the very least required investigation.    &quot;In this instance, there was insider trading, by Levine, and there was additional trading,&quot; said a person who has read the GAO's draft. &quot;Whether it was illicit or not, we don't know.&quot;    In any event, the GAO's report, at least in its draft form, appears to lend support to the argument that the SEC needs additional powers to pursue offshore-based insider trading.    In a report on the internationalization of the securities markets issued to Congress earlier this year, the SEC staff identified a &quot;trend toward the internationalization of fraud.&quot; The report singled out insider trading as a particularly troublesome area, noting that &quot;those who seek to engage in illegal trading while in possession of non-public information have attempted to conceal their activities by conducting their trading through foreign entities.&quot;    The Big Board's report to the SEC on trading in Carter Hawley was one of about two dozen that the exchange made to the agency related to trading by Mr. Levine, a former managing director of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. who was charged with insider trading in May 1986 and pleaded guilty a month later to securities fraud, tax evasion and perjury.    Information provided to the SEC by Mr. Levine led the commission to Ivan Boesky, who last November agreed to an unprecedented $100 million settlement of insider-trading charges.    The SEC generally only pursues a fraction of referrals it receives from the stock exchanges, a situation that has led to complaints in the past. In response to those complaints, the agency earlier this year began formally reviewing with the exchanges the status of such referrals once each quarter. </TEXT></DOC>
