For the purpose of obtaining an optimumsystematization in distillation stage of liquefaction process of bituminouscoal and achieve an optimum design on heavy solvent for hydrogenation,distilling condition of liquefied oil produced from Wandoan coal wasexamined and evaluated, and distillation and hydrotreating tests wereperformed, and quantitative evaluation method on process solvent forhydrogenated Wandoan coal was investigated. According to continuous distillationand solvent hydrotreating tests, reaction rate constant K changes greatlyat around 350 deg. C, and with this border the reaction may be arrangedto two different hydrogenation rate formula for low temperature zoneand high temperature zone. As a result of invenstigations on relationshipbetween various parameters for evaluation of solvent quality and hydrogenconsumption, it was recognized that there is a good correlation betweenspecific gravity and refractive index and the effect of hydrogen consumptionmay be analogized from this reaction. And it was found that the camparativeevaluation method of specific gravity and H/C ratio is not controlledby hydrotreating conditions so that it may be used extensively for allliquefied oils. In the meantime, using NEDOL Process, amount of 9,10hydrogen of 9,10 dihydroantheracene was quantitatively analyzed with1H-NMR and amount of hydrogen transferable to solvent was relativelyexamined. The method may be used for evaluation of quality of liquefactionsolvent. (4 figs, 2 tabs)</TEXT></DOC>
