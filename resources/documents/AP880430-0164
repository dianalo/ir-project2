About 500 pickets gathered in drizzling rain around midnight (7p.m. EDT) at the dockside at Dover, preparing what union leaderspromised would be a hostile reception for the two P and O shippingcompany ferries and their strike-breaking crews.   Police reinforcements formed lines in Dover as pickets shoutedat truck drivers crossing picket lines to board ferries of therival Sealink company.   P and O refused to give the two ferries' destination or whenthey would arrive.   The confrontation looming between pickets and non-strikingcrewmen at Dover in southeast England, the world's busiest ferryport, put Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's union-curbinglegislation to its toughest test since her re-election last June.   The P and O company's Pride of Kent and Pride of Bruges, leftRotterdam, Holland on a 10-hour voyage to England, crewed by about280 of the 1,100 employees who accepted new working conditions andopted out of a 3-month-old strike called by the National Union ofSeamen.   P and O has fired 720 other seamen who rejected the newcontract, and many of them manned picket lines at Dover.   Crew members of Sealink have refused for four days to cross thepicket lines, forcing Sealink to cut the number of daily round-tripvoyages to Calais, France from 16 to eight and use onlyFrench-crewed vessels.   With Monday a public holiday, the problems come on one of thetravel industry's busiest weekends of the year.   Sealink warned motorists of delays of up to six hours, while buspassengers were told they might wait 18 hours.   Truckers faced even longer delays, and police cordoned off lanesof the highway into Dover to accommodate stranded vehicles.   Mrs. Thatcher's legislation which forbids sympathy strikes hasenabled Sealink to seek court seizure of the union's funds.   The measure has proved critical in taming militant labor sectorslike the coal miners, railwaymen and newspaper printworkers inrecent years.   But the sequestration of funds could push the seamen into votingfor an all-out national strike, and Sealink has appeared at painsto prevent that, stressing that it is not in dispute with itsworkers and does not want to harm their union.   After talks with government mediators Friday, Sealink and unionnegotiators announced ``a skeleton agreement'' to save Sealink fromfurther disruption and asked to adjourn the hearing until Tuesday.   The negotiators said that under the agreement the seamen wouldconfine their pickets to Dover and neighboring Folkestone and calloff the scattered strikes that have broken out at other English andWelsh ports.   But later, the deal collapsed over the failure to bring P and Ointo the peace talks.   ``The deal with Sealink is off so far as I am concerned. AllSealink ferries should stay in port,'' said Sam McCluskie, leaderof the 24,400-member National Union of Seamen.   Some pickets set fire to a P and O flag and cheered as McCluskiewarned the crews in Rotterdam: ``If they stay there as scabs, theywill be marked as scabs forever.''   The ferries sailed from Rotterdam despite last-minute efforts bythe union to persuade their crews to join the strike.   Dutch tugboats ignored the union's pleas to refuse to handle thevessels.   Crews of the tugs said their action was saving the company frombeing sold to foreign owners, that the strike decision wasundemocratic and that had they been allowed to vote in a secretpostal ballot, they would have abided by the outcome.</TEXT></DOC>
