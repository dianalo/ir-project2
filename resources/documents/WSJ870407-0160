Your statement that we find that price increases before announcements of tender offers are &quot;almost entirely based on factors aside from illegal insider trading&quot; is an exaggeration of our evidence. Rather, looking at averages over a large sample, we find that there are certain readily identifiable factors that influence the amount of pre-bid trading -- including rumors reported in the press, the foothold acquisition of the bidder and whether the deal is hostile or friendly. However, we cannot state that these factors completely account for all pre-bid trading. And we cannot state that these factors themselves are not influenced by illegal insider trading.    The editorial is incorrect in stating that the study was &quot;aimed squarely at&quot; Gary Lynch, director of the Division of Enforcement. Our goal was to provide empirical evidence showing that factors other than illegal insider trading affected pre-bid market activity. We undertook this project in reaction to the many commentators outside the commission who have equated all pre-bid trading with illegal insider activity.    The most troublesome part of your editorial, however, is the suggestion that Mr. Lynch was unaware of or unreceptive to our work. He and his staff contributed to the report and supported its release.    Annette B. Poulsen   Acting Chief Economist   Securities and Exchange Commission    Washington</TEXT></DOC>
