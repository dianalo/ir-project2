In the battle for the hearts and minds of the 100,000 dealers, corporate customers and other spectators gathered here, IBM has set up a series of demonstrations of the Micro Channel, which is the PS/2's internal data pathway. The demonstrations seek to show that this pathway has extra flexibility that can translate into more speed. One demonstration uses an add-in circuit board that IBM claims allows data to be sent over a network about 60% faster. Another illustrates a quicker way to store the huge amounts of data handled by a so-called file server, the machine that controls a network of personal computers.    While most personal computers contain just one &quot;master&quot; processor -- the chip that tells the various parts of the computer what to do -- the Micro Channel allows for more than one. That means that in Micro Channel machines, the workhorse central processor can dump lots of work onto another processor, freeing itself to go about other tasks.    But IBM has had trouble convincing anyone that this makes a difference. Few add-in circuit cards have been designed to take advantage of that flexibility, and all the software that runs on the IBM machines runs competitors' IBM-compatible products. In addition, a group of nine major competitors has promised a pathway with similar flexibility by late next year. That will be in plenty of time, they say, for corporate customers that want to try the complex software systems that will become possible. The IBM competitors also promise that customers' existing circuit boards will work with their new hardware, whereas customers have needed to buy new boards for use with the Micro Channel.    &quot;IBM has had a hard time getting the message across about why the Micro Channel is better. Now they can say, 'Here. Look,'&quot; said Jeff Edelstein, manager of product evaluation at Businessland Inc., a huge chain of computer dealers. Still, he said, the complex applications that Micro Channel facilitates are so arcane that &quot;for the general user this really means very little.&quot;    Ironically, IBM figures to get a boost from the PS/2 clones at the show. Although clones weakened IBM's position with its initial PC line, the fact that only a few companies have been selling Micro Channel clones has made customers wary of the new line. Yet, even here, the impact is mixed because there are fewer clones than were expected a few weeks ago, and they are mainly from little-known companies.    IBM also unveiled a new addition to its line of local area networks, or LANs, which can lash together groups of computers, even from different makers. The new product lets information move along IBM's network at 16 million bits per second, quadruple the previous rate, IBM said.    Also at the Comdex show, Commodore International Ltd. is showing off two new computers in its Amiga line, a less-visible but feisty rival to Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh in the market for easy-to-use machines with flashy graphics. The new Amigas add speed and memory.    Companies also are displaying a spate of developments in disk-drive technology.    Control Data Corp.'s Imprimis Technology Corp. unit introduced a hard-disk drive that can hold more than a gigabyte, or more than a billion characters of information, giving it twice the capacity of the biggest drives now on the market.    Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. is showing a 3.5-inch floppy disk that holds more than 11 megabytes of information, some eight times as much as floppies currently available.    Despite such gains, and a slew of new laptops that should keep feeding the remarkable growth in that segment of the market, this year's show, while as crowded as ever, seems more subdued than last year's. No one, for instance, has offered to pick up party guests with a fleet of helicopters, as happened last year for a party of several thousand.    Still, business has been booming for most of the major players in the industry, and they say things look good well into next year. Rod Canion, chief executive of Compaq Computer Corp., Houston, said Compaq's third quarter was extremely strong and the fourth quarter looks so strong that the company can't keep up with demand for several products. &quot;And where does that demand go? It doesn't just disappear. So we're very bullish, at least on the first half of next year.&quot;    Yet there have been some cautionary signs. Semiconductor order rates, an indicator of future personal-computer demand, have been dropping. Some makers of semiconductors and disk drives have reported startlingly bad results over the past few months. And stock prices for most companies in the industry have slumped.    &quot;I think people are still optimistic,&quot; says Richard Shaffer, editor of Technologic Computer Letter, an industry newsletter. &quot;But they worry that Wall Street knows something the industry doesn't.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
