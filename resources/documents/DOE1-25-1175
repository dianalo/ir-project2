The molar absorptivity of the complexis 6.1 x 10{sup 4} l.mole{sup -1}. cm{sup -1} at 570 nm and its conditionalextraction constant 5 x 10{sup 13} l{sup 4}.mole{sup -4}. Similar complexeshave been found to be formed with yttrium, cerium, praseodymium, neodymiumand samarium. The use of these complexes for the spectrophotometric determinationof yttrium and lanthanides up to 15 {mu}g has been investigated.</TEXT></DOC>
