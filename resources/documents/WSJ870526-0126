Landover, Md.-based Dart said Friday it tendered its 1.9 million Supermarkets General shares to the investor group that is taking the Woodbridge, N.J.-based food retailer private in a $1.8 billion leveraged buyout. As previously reported, a group backed by a Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. unit launched a tender offer last month for Supermarkets General as a way to fend off a takeover threat from Dart.    Dart, an operator of discount bookstores and auto supply stores, previously had proposed acquiring Supermarkets General for more than $1.73 billion, but withdrew its offer in early April. At the time, Dart said it remained interested in buying Supermarkets General and was &quot;prepared to compete to that end.&quot;    The Haft family, which controls Dart, considered topping the investor group's offer for Supermarkets General and had until Friday, when the Supermarkets General offer expired, to do so.    But Robert Haft, Dart's president, said Dart decided against that course of action because &quot;the price we would have had to pay to buy Supermarkets General would have made it what we considered to be an uneconomic purchase.&quot;    He added: &quot;We had the financing to complete such a purchase, but it wasn't justified.&quot;    One source said Dart had been advised by its investment banker that a successful bid would have cost more than $49 a share, including about $1 a share in breakup fees that Merrill Lynch and others involved in the investor group would have been entitled to.    By tendering its Supermarkets General shares to the investor group instead, Dart will walk away with a profit of &quot;slightly less than $40 million,&quot; the source said. Dart paid &quot;in the mid to high 20s&quot; for the 1,920,700 Supermarkets General shares it purchased earlier this year, the source added.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Supermarkets General closed at $45.25 a share, down 12.5 cents.    As previously reported, traders and investment bankers have valued the investor group's proposal at $46.50 a share. The group is offering $46.75 a share, or $1.5 billion, for 85% of Supermarkets General's 38.5 million shares outstanding. Holders of the remaining shares will receive a package of debt securities and preferred stock. In a leveraged buyout, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with debt that ultimately is paid with funds generated by the acquired company.    Dart now is expected to turn its attention to a new takeover target, either in retailing or real estate. &quot;That seems to be what they're best at doing these days,&quot; said Susan Schmierer, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. &quot;It's gotten to be a fairly consistent pattern.&quot;    In recent years, Dart has bought large stakes in or made unsuccessful bids for Safeway Stores Inc., May Department Stores Co., Jack Eckerd Corp., Revco D.S. Inc. and Beatrice Cos.    When Dart made its initial proposal to buy Supermarkets General in March, it said it had more than $400 million in cash, including about $140 million in profit from its unsuccessful attempt to take over Safeway last year. </TEXT></DOC>
