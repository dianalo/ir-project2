The agencies are piling up experience so rapidly that ``itshould be possible now, or become possible in the near future, tosort planned introductions into broad categories for which low,medium or high levels of review are appropriate,'' the Office ofTechnology Assessment said in a report.   So far, there have been about two dozen field tests of one kindor another in 12 states and four foreign countries, the study said.   ``With adequate review, none of the small-scale field testsproposed or probable within the next several years (is) likely toresult in an environmental problem that would be widespread ordifficult to control,'' it said.   In agriculture, a new crop strain or rotation probably couldease or control damage _ if any _ from experiments gone awry, thereport said.   A worst-case outcome, the authors wrote, would appear to be ``todisrupt a fundamental ecosystem process, for example, the cyclingof a mineral or a nutrient, or the flow of energy in an ecosystem.Such disruptions are not, however, among the credible consequencesof any introduction that seems likely within the next severalyears.''   Such disruptions could be ``difficult to control andfar-reaching in their effects,'' and are conceivable as the resultof releasing a new microbe with enhanced ability to degrade toxicwaste or cellulose, the report said.   Many species perform the same functions in an ecosystem, andthis redundancy, coupled with the resilience of ecosystems, ``arepersuasive arguments against the likelihood of such consequences.''   Crop plants and domestic livestock appear to pose the least riskfrom genetic engineering techniques, the report said in suggestingpoints regulators might consider in deciding where to loosenscrutiny.   Examples of such criteria include whether the new organism ischanged in its structural or regulatory genes. Regulatory genesdeserve more attention, the report said, because they govern howmuch product a cell makes through its structural genes and thiscould enhance survivability or vulnerability in the environment.   Another example might be the deletion of genes, which the reportsaid probably don't need as much review as the insertion of genes.Deletions are far more common in nature than insertions.   ``Although the characteristics of engineered organisms makecertain kinds less likely than others to cause problems, it is notnow possible to describe any broad categories thay could becompletely exempted from review,'' the report cautioned.   ``Counterexamples can be provided from existing experience tonegate almost any proposed category for exemption from review.''   The new ``recombinant'' techniques of genetic engineering thatmake possible the insertion of a gene from one species into theDNA, the genetic material, of another have prompted research aimedat making, among other things:   _Plants that can resist pests, pesticides, or diseases; usefertilizers better or perhaps do without them.   _Bacteria that can confer frost resistance on plants.   _New animal vaccines.   _Animals with greater meat or milk production.   _Microbes that can digest toxic waste better than existingstrains or even concentrate metallic ores.   ``It is important to note that modifying organisms for specifichuman ends is not new,'' the technology assessment office said.   ``Selective breeders of plants and animals have beentransferring genes for millenia, often creating forms throughcenturies of selection that differ from their original stocks morethan the forms produced by recombinant DNA methods.''</TEXT></DOC>
