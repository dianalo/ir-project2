Denounced by its critics as blasphemous and profane, the movieabout a Jesus with human frailties not only has energized theChristian right; it has revived stagnant fund-raising, Christianleaders say.   The movie ``has helped our ministry more than anything elsebefore,'' said the Rev. Donald Wildmon, leader of the AmericanFamily Association. Said Don Beehler, director of communicationsfor Campus Crusade for Christ: ``This gives us a wonderfulopportunity to talk about the real Jesus Christ. ... We're takinglemons and making lemonade.''   At the same time, filmgoers are not avoiding the movie, asChristian leaders had hoped. In fact, the controversy seems to haveprompted more people to see it.   That price, though, might be a small one for Christianactivists. Beset by negative publicity from the Jim Bakker andJimmy Swaggart scandals, conservative Christians have used ``LastTemptation'' as a lightning rod around which to organize and raisemoney.   In addition to bringing together fundamentalists, Pentecostals,Prostestants and Catholics, the controversy makes for a naturalfund-raiser: It pits the conservative Christian organizations,which often depict themselves as small and struggling, against aHollywood Goliath.   The Concerned Women for America, in a fund-raising letter, said,``Your gift of $100, $75, $50, $20 _ or whatever amount _ is sorelyneeded. We need your financial help to fight these rich Hollywoodmoguls.'' Similarly, the American Family Association has said thatthose ``giving $15 or more to help AFA oppose the movie willreceive a one year subscription to the AFA Journal.''   ``Jerry Falwell has been preaching about the movie for the lastthree weeks,'' said the Rev. Robert Hymers, a Los Angeles ministerwho has been one of the movie's most outspoken critics. ``Falwell'sdoing a tremendous fund-rasing job through the film.''   The American Society for the Defense of Tradition, Family andProperty used a four-page, full-color attack on the movie tosolicit small contributions. ``People have put their money wheretheir values are,'' said Raymond Drake, president of theorganization. Drake said that a phone campaign brought in $39,000,enough for a full-page advertisement in The New York Times againstthe movie.   It also may be true that some Christian-themed organizations aretrying to exploit the controversy for less-than-noble purposes.   ``I've seen the fund-raising letters. (The movie) has becomeanother hype button to raise funds,'' said Cal Thomas, a syndicatedcolumnist and former comunications director for the Moral Majority.   Universal Pictures, meanwhile, appears to have benefited fromthe controversy. By telling people not to see the movie, Christianleaders may have encouraged the opposite response. ``Universal israking in the dough,'' Thomas said.   Studio officials refused comment.   Although ``Last Temptation'' is by no means a blockbuster, ithas done respectable business for an art film, grossing more than$2 million since its limited release Aug. 12. ``It wouldn't havedone anywhere near what's it's done without the controversy,'' saidAlex Ben Block, editor of the industry newsletter Sow Biz News.``Although some Christians might have stayed away, many other(filmgoers) went because of the controversy. People say, `If theytell me I can't go, I'll go.' ''   At the same time, production plans for at least one movie with aChristian theme are not being stalled by the flap: ``Christ theMan,'' to be directed by Paul Verhoeven, is in the planning stagesat Mel Brooks' production company. Described by company spokeswomanRandy Auerbach as a serious interpretation of Jesus' life, themovie will be ``absolutely unaffected'' by criticisms of ``LastTemptation.''   It is too early to tell if the attacks on Universal Pictureswill lead to any long-term losses, though Christian leaders arehopeful. ``What we're sensing is a lot of people _ in the tens ofmillions _ who are now angry at Universal,'' said Tim Penland, whoserved as a consultant to film producer Universal Pictures beforebecoming a leading critic of the movie.   Wildmon and other activists will soon launch a boycott againstUniversal's videocassette of ``E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' dueout Oct. 27.   After that, there are no announced plans aimed at Universal.But, said Beehler, ``Universal will always be remembered as thestudio that made a film defaming Jesus Christ.''</TEXT></DOC>
