 The transfer of shares will take place on Jan.andO;2, 1990.andM;The acquisition, which follows by seven months Barco's purchase of DISC,includes all Aesthedes products, as well as the Aesthedes design servicebureau operations in the U.S.; Aesthedes research and manufacturingoperations in Geel and Hilversum, the Netherlands; and Aesthedes subsidiariesand sales offices in Belgium, England, France, Italy, Japan, Spain,Switzerland, Sweden, the Netherlands and West Germany.andM;All European operations and products will be folded into the Barcoorganization.andM;The worldwide Aesthedes organization becomes part of Barco's newly formedGraphic Systems Group, which also includes DISC.andP;  Barco Graphic Systems willbe headed by Prof.andP;  Dr. Ir.andP;  Patrick Bergmans, who is currently in charge ofDISC and Creative Systems, and by Hugo Vandamme, president, who is alsopresident of Barco n.v.andM;Dominique Claessens will remain with Aesthedes as president of the U.S.andO;subsidiary, Aesthedes, Inc., based in Torrance, California.andM;Aesthedes employs 117 people, 30 of whom are active in Randamp;D.andM;Where Aesthedes fits.andP;  Besides the Aesthedes and DISC product lines, theGraphic Systems Group includes the Creator, a Barco-developed design andretouching package that runs on the Silicon Graphics Iris workstation.andP;  Thethree products will have independent Randamp;D groups located, as now, in differentparts of Belgium.andP;  But sales and marketing will be combined, and the productswill evolve into a compatible product line.andM;Besies the new Graphic Systems Division, Barco has two other divisions.andP;  TheVisualization Division makes high-end monitors for broadcast and computerapplications.andP;  The Automation Division makes equipment for the textilemanufacturing industry.andP;  (Barco was originally a radio manufacturer--the nameis an acronym for Belgian-American Radio Company--but it has not made radiosfor many years.)andM;According to Claessens, the DISC group will focus on production-orientedsystems for applications like forms and packaging and on output recorders.andO;(A specialty will be large-format output for cartography.andP;  Scitex, once amajor supplier, no long offers a recorder for this market.)andP;  The Creatorgroup will focus on creative retouching, design and electronic illustration.andO;The Aesthedes group will emphasize packaging and corporate marketingmaterials, including page-layout functions for catalogs, brochures and thelike.andP;  The Aesthedes market tends toward shops with more variety, more designinvolvement and higher volumes than the specialists that DISC sells to.andM;Naturally, not everything has been worked out yet, and there will be areas ofproduct overlap (such as packaging) for some time to come.andP;  But the objectiveis a compatible range of products.andP;  There will also be sharing of Randamp;D, withsome software developed by each group becoming available to the others.andP;  Thebeginnings of the integration process should be evident at Drupa in May,where the three groups will exhibit together for the first time.andM;Marketing of Aesthedes and Creator systems in the U.S.andP;  will be done throughthe existing Aesthedes organization.andP;  DISC products continue to be soldthrough AM International under the Harris Graphics name in the U.S.andP;  Ingeneral, Barco will move toward a single marketing organization in allcountries for the Graphic Systems Division.andP;  But this organization will notoverlap with the Visualization group, which must be free to continue to sellmonitors to potential competitors including Scitex, Crosfield and Hell.andM;Jan Fremeijer of Aesthedes remains in charge of sales and marketing of theAesthedes line and of Creative Systems.andP;  He also will be in charge of theintegration of all prepress products.andM;Rob Haak of DISC remains responsible for the sales of the DISC products andwill be in charge of the integration of the distribution channels of BarcoGraphic Systems.andP;  Christiaan Huynen remains general manager of Aesthedes n.v.andM;Until now, Barco has been an up-and-coming supplier of color peripheralsystems.andP;  With the acquisition of DISC and Aesthedes, Barco has quicklyestablished itself as one of the leading new players in the high-resolutioncolor market.andP;  Aesthedes has many installed systems and a well-establishedreputation in the design market, a market Barco hopes to penetrate furtherwith its new Creator system.andM;Aesthedes recently became the European distributor for Superset, which makesa retouching system that in many respects competes with Barco's Creator.andP;  Wedon't know yet what will become of that agreement.andM;It is interesting to note that one by one the design firms are beingacquired: Contex by Xyvision, Lightspeed and Dicomed by Crosfield, and nowAesthedes by Barco.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
