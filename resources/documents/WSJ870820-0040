BulkeleyStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> COMPUTERS (EDP) </IN><TEXT>   When International Business Machines Corp. introduced its latest generation of personal computers in the spring, it included sharper graphics, bigger memories, and more bells and whistles in an effort to persuade people to scrap their old models and buy the new ones.    Many business and individual computer owners will do just that. But many others will figure on getting most of the latest IBM benefits by simply buying new parts and inserting them in earlier models. For a few hundred dollars, a computer owner usually can upgrade an old model and at least &quot;limp along until the price comes down&quot; on the newer machines, says Russ Walter, a Somerville, Mass., author who writes about computers. Some owners will go even further, adding equipment to provide all the special features they want -- while postponing the purchase of a new computer for years.    Welcome to the personal computer &quot;aftermarket,&quot; or add-on market, where tinkerers spend hours souping up old computers rather than buying new ones. By adding fancy accessories to earlier models, it's as if the computer buffs were putting Ferrari engines, Maserati suspensions and Indy-racer clutches into the bodies of Volkswagen Beetles.    Computer users spend hundreds of millions of dollars each year on the add-ons, which range from more ordinary parts -- such as modems and extra software -- to the fancier equipment, which virtually changes the computer into a new machine. The add-ons, produced by dozens of companies specializing in the aftermarket as well as by major computer makers, often are distributed by mail order and discount computer stores.    Relying on add-ons has its risks, though. Careless tinkerers can open a can of worms when they unbolt the computer case, and what appear to be simple installations can prove difficult. &quot;I think I've saved some money, but I know I've spent some time,&quot; says Jonathan Leavy, chief financial officer of Axiom Technologies Inc., Newton, Mass., who has added numerous features to his personal computer at home. Mr. Leavy's Compaq Computer Corp. model now includes, for instance, a hard disk for expanded data storage and a clock and calendar feature that automatically dates the material he is working on.    Moreover, the add-ons don't always mesh as well as expected. &quot;Even if I put a Ferrari engine in a Chevette, I probably can't drive it at 200 miles per hour,&quot; says Mark Tebbe, president of Lante Corp., a Chicago computer consulting firm.    The array of add-ons is especially vast for IBM personal computers and IBM compatibles. Increasingly, such products are being made for Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh. Although add-ons aren't yet available to match the features of IBM's new Personal System/2 line, such features as the improved graphics probably will be mimicked soon. Some of the add-ons, however, are likely to be expensive.    Still, as consumers try to decide whether to spend $5,000 or more for the most powerful of IBM's new PS/2 line, interest in the aftermarket is likely to grow. Many computer owners may add equipment rather than scrap the machines they bought just two or three years ago. &quot;There is a significant investment in existing PCs,&quot; says Aaron Goldberg of International Data Corp., a market research firm in Framingham, Mass. He says 80% of the 10 million IBM-compatible computers now in use are less than three years old.    Among the most popular aftermarket products are add-ons that increase computer memory. Today's software works best if the computer has memory boards that can hold 640,000 bits of information, the capacity of the operating system now standard in IBM-compatible computers. The first IBM personal computers and compatible models held only a tenth of that. &quot;Anybody with less than (640,000 bits) is out of his mind,&quot; says Seymour Merrin, a Connecticut consultant and former computer dealer. &quot;Nobody is writing small programs of any consequence.&quot;    Owners of the older computer models can easily, and cheaply, add chips to enhance memory. A computer capable of holding 256,000 bits of information, for instance, can be upgraded to 640,000 with memory boards bought from a mail-order company for $125.    Another popular aftermarket product is the hard disk, a data-storage device fixed inside the personal computer. Older personal computers usually have two floppy-disk drives that each hold about 180 double-spaced pages of information. But newer models generally have one floppy-disk drive, plus a hard disk that holds 10,000 pages.    Hard disks can be bought for as little as $330 from mail-order outlets. But they can be difficult to install and don't always operate smoothly. For about $70 more, a computer owner can buy a card with tiny hard disks attached, which easily slips into one of the expansion slots inside a personal computer. &quot;Pop it in the slot and away you go,&quot; Mr. Walter says.    Add-ons also enable the older computers to match the speed of later models. Infoworld, a computer hobbyist magazine, calculated that the Breakthru 286 circuit board, available for $595 from Dallas-based Personal Computer Support Group, more than quadrupled the speed of an IBM PC-XT, a model that was introduced four years ago. Computer owners can also buy a board including the Intel Corp. 80386 microprocessor -- which is at the heart of the fastest new personal computers -- and insert it into their older machines.    With more esoteric add-ons, earlier models can go beyond the special features of the latest personal computers. Several companies, for example, make circuit cards that turn the computers into facsimile machines for sending and receiving documents over phone lines. Datacopy Corp., Mountain View, Calif., says its $1,195 MicroFax, which can be plugged into a standard phone line, sends and receives facsimile messages as easily as a $3,000 facsimile machine. The computer can continue to do regular computer tasks while sending or receiving the facsimile.    Other add-ons can turn the computer into a sophisticated answering machine. Complete PC of Milpitas, Calif., sells the Complete Answering Machine circuit board for $349, which allows users to call the computer over the telephone to see if any messages are pending. The system can be set up so that the computer can call the owner and repeat urgent messages.    Also available are scanners that read typed information and store it in the computer, saving the user from having to retype the material to enter it into the machine. And users can add speech-recognition devices that enable the computer to respond to a few spoken commands.    Going overboard on add-ons, however, can be self-defeating. &quot;If you try to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, you can end up with a lot of problems,&quot; says Mr. Goldberg. &quot;All of a sudden the 'compatible' parts become incompatible. You end up spending as much as you would have for a new system, and you'll certainly outspend it in aggravation.&quot;    ---                     Popular Add-Ons   Percentage of corporate buyers planning to purchase theseadd-on products for computers this year: Modem                                             52% Hard disk                                         43 Power protection device                           37 Memory device                                     30 Tape backup                                       28 Math accelerator                                  26 Floppy disk                                       25 Mouse                                             21 Accelerator board                                 14 Replacement keyboard                              11 Light pen                                          6   Source: PC Magazine survey</TEXT></DOC>
