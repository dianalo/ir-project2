Winter (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> LABOR </CO><IN> ECO </IN><TEXT>   Manufacturers are finding it harder to keep the lid on labor costs.    Their goal is to keep productivity rising at least as rapidly as wages and benefits. Many say they can achieve that in 1989, preventing any increase in the cost of labor for each tire, toaster or television produced -- what economists call unit labor costs.    But after five years of decline, unit labor costs have begun to edge up among manufacturers. Wages and benefits this year have been rising at nearly double 1987's 2.1% rate, slightly exceeding the gain in productivity. As a result, manufacturers' unit labor costs in the third quarter crept up 0.7% from a year earlier, the Labor Department reported yesterday.    This modest upturn follows a spectacularly successful period of manufacturing labor cost control during this prolonged economic recovery. Manufacturers actually are spending 4.6% less for the labor in each unit of goods produced than was spent in 1982. A spurt in productivity has pushed output per hour up more rapidly than wages and benefits. By contrast, wage and benefit costs per unit of output soared 57% in the preceding six years.    The easy part's over, though. Many producers have shuttered their oldest, least efficient plants and pruned the fat from the remaining ones. Because manufacturers are prospering, they're finding it harder to wring concessions from unionized workers. And today's tighter labor market may force some companies to raise wages to attract the people they need.    &quot;The easy gains in productivity have been made, and there's a question whether manufacturers can continue to hold down compensation,&quot; says Lawrence Chimerine, chairman and chief executive officer of the WEFA Group, economic consultants based in Bala Cynwyd, Pa.    Executives and economists consider it essential that U.S. manufacturers limit the rise in labor costs if they are to further improve their competitive position in world markets. Furthermore, the Federal Reserve Board likely would view a rapid rise in factory labor costs as evidence that inflation is getting out of hand. A tighter money supply would follow, possibly triggering a recession.    So far, though, nothing that drastic is in sight. Factory wages and benefits are likely to rise 4% to 4.5% next year, while productivity will climb 2.5% to 3%, says Richard D. Rippe, senior vice president and economist with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc. That would produce a 1% to 2% rise in unit labor costs.    Several economists and manufacturers, however, believe such an increase can be avoided. &quot;Cost control and restructuring of production is an ongoing process, and opportunities for improvement are far from exhausted,&quot; maintains A. Gary Shilling, a New York-based economic consultant.    &quot;We still have a list of changes as long as your arm that will help improve productivity,&quot; says J. E. Taylor, president of closely held Torq Corp., a Bedford, Ohio, producer of specialized switches for electric motors. &quot;We think we can keep productivity rising as fast as wage rates.&quot;    Plant managers also say they've honed some new cost-containment weapons in the past few years that will keep labor costs from soaring. Most important is a new climate in which employees are enlisted into cost-cutting efforts. Many workers and union leaders actively cooperate, believing their jobs are at stake.    In contract bargaining these days, job security usually comes ahead of big wage increases. Strikes are rare, pay raises modest, and some companies give a one-time signing bonus instead of wage increases, which are cumulative. Some workers, such as at Huffy Corp.'s bicycle plant at Celina, Ohio, receive bonuses when productivity rises.    While labor concessions captured headlines in recent years, a less visible spurt in productivity helped even more to retard manufacturers' unit labor costs. Factory output per hour is up a striking 29% since 1982, dwarfing the 11% rise in productivity for the whole non-farm economy.    Productivity gains are easier when factories are running just short of full steam, as many will be next year. They operated at 83.6% of capacity during both August and September, a rate that keeps workers busy without creating the inefficient scrambling that occurs when plants are running at capacity.    At most plants, trimming labor costs has been attained not by firing but by eliminating unnecessary functions -- parts inspection, warehousing, materials handling and redundant supervision, among others -- and reorganizing the production process. Companies have found that, with training, workers can check their own work with little supervision.    Consider what's happened at Eaton Corp.'s plant in Marshall, Mich. It was rearranged so a rough forging placed on a conveyor travels automatically from machine to machine until it emerges as a polished gear for a truck differential. Computerized measuring machines, instead of human inspectors, assure that automated turning centers cut gears to a precise size.    Consequently, gears that formerly were handled 13 times by lift trucks and 35 times by human hands will by next year be moved only three times by lift trucks and six times by workers.    Further, a new &quot;pay for knowledge&quot; compensation system at the plant adopted two years ago encourages workers to learn as many skills as possible. The plan wiped out nearly 100 separate pay categories and gave management far greater flexibility in assigning work. Wages were slashed as much as $5 an hour for the least skilled workers. Each worker's pay now depends on the number of jobs he or she can do rather than the function performed at any given time.    All this has helped reduce unit labor costs in one part of the plant by 25% in two years. That part produces a clutch which makes automatic transmissions in Cadillacs shift more smoothly. Unit labor costs in differential production is down 6% to 10% and will drop an additional 15% or more by the end of next year, says Martin L. Markovich, plant manager.    Surprisingly, a major part of the labor saving in manufacturing companies these days isn't in the factory at all. For example, of 700 jobs eliminated at Reynolds andamp; Reynolds Co. in recent months, only 200 were at its printing plants, says the Dayton, Ohio, supplier of business forms and computer systems. Some 250 jobs were cut from computer programming and other computer support. The remaining reductions mainly were in office jobs. </TEXT></DOC>
