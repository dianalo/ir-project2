During oral arguments on whether to overrule the precedent, Justices Sandra O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy voiced concerns that the 12-year-old ruling allowing suits for private discrimination encroaches on enforcement of a 1964 federal law barring employment discrimination.    Comments made during oral arguments don't always indicate what position justices ultimately will take. But the questions suggested that the two Reagan appointees believe the 1976 ruling, an interpretation of a Reconstruction-era law, could be overturned as inconsistent with congressional intent as reflected by the job-discrimination law.    The case is one of the most visible symbols of the Supreme Court's current polarization between liberals and conservatives. It also may demonstrate the impact of President Reagan's appointments of the two justices and Justice Antonin Scalia, and his elevation of Justice William Rehnquist to be chief justice.    Last April, when the high court ordered lawyers to reargue the case and address whether to overrule the 1976 decision, four liberals -- Justices William Brennan, Thurgood Marshall, Harry Blackmun and John Stevens -- strenuously objected. The decision to take up the issue was led by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Byron White, the two dissenters in 1976. They were joined by Justice Scalia, the court's most ardent conservative, and by Justices Kennedy and O'Connor.    For the conservatives to win, the five justices must hold ranks. Conversely, the liberals must shake loose at least one vote to prevail, with Justices Kennedy and O'Connor being the most likely possibilities.    In the case, Patterson vs. McLean Credit Union, a black woman sued her North Carolina employer for damages for racial harassment. The 1976 ruling allowing such private discrimination suits was based on an 1866 law guaranteeing that all citizens, regardless of their race, have the same right to make contracts. Prior to 1976, the law had served largely as a basis for suing over government interference with the business and contract rights of minorities.    In a lively exchange, Justice O'Connor said use of the 1866 law to collect damages in private job discrimination cases encroaches on Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which required payment of back wages and reinstatement as the means to redress job bias. The law was to be administered by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.    &quot;Why did Congress pass Title VII and create the EEOC?&quot; she asked, suggesting that the 1976 court ruling had the effect of improperly making the 1964 law &quot;a dead letter.&quot;    Similarly, Justice Kennedy questioned whether there is &quot;an evolving standard&quot; to determine what type of discrimination Congress intended to redress in 1866. He asked whether there is &quot;any controlling principle&quot; for the court to follow.    Julius Chambers, director of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., argued against overruling the 1976 decision. He said that while the type of discrimination covered by the law may change over the years, the law still is aimed at eliminating &quot;the badge of slavery.&quot;    Roger Kaplan, the New York lawyer who represented McLean Credit Union in attacking the 1976 ruling, was pressed repeatedly by Justice Scalia. The justice -- apparently trying to strengthen the case against the 1976 decision -- asked for reasons why the high court should depart from its usual practice of respecting its own precedents. But he said he wasn't satisfied with Mr. Kaplan's response.    The court is likely to hand down a decision in the spring. </TEXT></DOC>
