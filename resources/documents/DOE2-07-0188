This prescriptionallows us to overcome some problems left open by the Dirac method, andin particular the problem of the definition of the physical scalar producton the space of physical states. It is studied the possibility of usingthe group quantization for dealing not only with the kinematics, butalso with the dynamics of the system.</TEXT></DOC>
