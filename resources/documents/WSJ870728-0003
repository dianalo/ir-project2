Hundreds of the nation's largest companies are wrestling with that question because of changes approved in last year's tax-law overhaul. The employers stand to reap millions of dollars in tax savings if they can persuade executives to give up the special tax status of their incentive stock options.    &quot;It's 'let's make a deal' time,&quot; says Peter Chingos, an executive compensation specialist at the accounting firm Peat Marwick Main andamp; Co.    Before the tax changes, incentive options were a popular form of compensation for executives because the arrangement deferred taxes and, moreover, because capital gains were taxed at a much lower rate than personal income.    After this year, however, capital gains and personal income will be taxed at the same rate, making the incentive options less attractive to many executives. In response, many companies are asking executives to convert their incentive options to so-called nonqualified options -- which trigger taxes earlier for the executive but provide a tax break for the employer.    Shareholders at FMC Corp., Capital Cities/ABC Inc., General Cinema Corp. and other companies already have amended their stock-option plans so that executives can be asked to voluntarily switch to nonqualified options.    Although such conversions may benefit the employer, many executives may be better off keeping the incentive options because of the tax deferral they provide. &quot;Clearly, if you're planning to hold the stock for 20 years, you're better off with incentive options,&quot; says Webb Bassick, a partner in Hewitt Associates, a Lincolnshire, Ill.-based consulting firm.    Unlike incentive options, nonqualified options trigger taxes as soon as they are exercised. The executives have to pay taxes on the &quot;bargain element&quot; -- the difference between the exercise price and the stock's current trading price. That same amount is the deduction that the employer gets when the options are exercised.    For executives who are asked to convert incentive options, &quot;the key issue is what inducement the company will give&quot; to get the executive to go along, says Jude Rich, president of Sibson andamp; Co., a Princeton, N.J.-based consulting firm.    Even before the tax law went into effect, companies began devising cash bonus plans that would entice executives into converting their incentive options. Such bonuses are meant to compensate executives for having to pay taxes sooner on nonqualified options than they would if they held on to the incentive options.    Recent accounting changes proposed by the Financial Accounting Standards Board, however, would make cash bonuses more expensive for many companies to use in a conversion offer. As a result, some companies now are granting extra nonqualified options, in lieu of cash, to executives who forgo the tax break on their incentive options. Executives who agree to the change also are being given additional stock-appreciation rights, which allow holders to benefit from stock-price gains without actually having to buy and sell the shares.    For many executives, the bonuses won't make up for the loss of the tax deferral. &quot;Generally, these bonuses aren't being calculated using a long holding period&quot; for the stock, says Steve Pennachio, a Peat Marwick tax partner. &quot;If an executive sells the stock sooner than the company estimates he will, he wins. But if he holds the stock longer than that, he loses.&quot;    If the stock's price has soared since an executive received the incentive options, the executive would have to pay a sizable tax when the options are exercised. &quot;It's possible the bonus wouldn't make up for having to pay the tax early,&quot; says Mr. Pennachio.    Meanwhile, some financial counselors are urging executives to beat their companies to the punch, according to Mr. Bassick. He says these advisers are recommending that their clients &quot;go into the company and say, 'O.K., if I agree to convert my incentive stock options to nonqualified, will you give me something extra?'    &quot;If you're one of the top 50 people, maybe you can pull that off,&quot; Mr. Bassick adds. &quot;Otherwise, it would be tough.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
