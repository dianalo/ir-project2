Mr. Shanker has finally come to recognize what any honest supervisor learns in his very first year, i.e., that many teachers need firm and demanding oversight before they will exert themselves.    For 30 years as a high-school principal I had to swim against the tide. Now I am happy to see that Mr. Shanker has come around to expecting &quot;accountability&quot; of teachers, opening his mind to merit pay, etc. Unfortunately, merit pay is administratively impossible, but that's another story.
