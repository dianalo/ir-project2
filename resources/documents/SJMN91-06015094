VIEW  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     The burden: Mountain View taxpayers will have to support the center at atime when city officials are concerned about a shrinking tax base for their$47 million general fund.;    In the center's first year, the subsidy will bequite large -- $600,000 for staff and upkeep and another $500,000 in seedmoney for a non-profit foundation to support the arts. Over five years, thesubsidy to the foundation, called Friends of the Mountain View Center Inc.,will be curtailed and eliminated, after the city spends a planned total of$1.5 million.;    But the operational commitment, though it may change, ispermanent -- which raises the question of whether the city will make money,lose money or break even. It's a question that won't be answered for manymonths.;    City Manager Kevin Duggan said the center would do well to take asmall loss. &quot;A facility like this, to the best of my knowledge, never makesmoney,&quot; he said. &quot;It's kind of like a library or a park.&quot;;    But CouncilwomanPat Figueroa, for one, wouldn't accept that answer. &quot;I don't consider it adrain,&quot; she said of the center. &quot;At the very minimum, I would like to see itpay for itself. I don't think that's too much to hope for. If it doesn't, thenI think we need to look at why not.&quot;;    One person working to wean the centerpartially from city funds is Steve Hams, board president of the fledglingfoundation. He and other volunteers are coordinating fund-raising to enablethe center to draw big-name performers and sponsor artistic residencies andoutreach programs.;    The $135-a-head dinner and dance Saturday is theFriends' first event. Its price has turned some heads around town, but Hamssaid the cost will pay off by helping the Friends get off the ground.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  NICK ANDERSON, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  South County  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910115  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  372  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 15, 199100015094,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
