The year-ago quarter included a gain of $45.1 million from discontinued operations. This year's quarter showed a 10% earnings gain over year-ago continuing operations of $92.8 million, or $1.17 a share.    For the nine months, the company posted net of $268.5 million, or $3.43 a share, down 24% from year-earlier net of $354.8 million, or $4.56 a share. The year-ago period included a $79 million gain from the sale of Transamerica's aircraft and equipment by the company's discontinued air-travel operation.    In the year-ago period, the company posted profit from continuing operations of $275.8 million, or $3.52 a share. Analysts said Transamerica's operating results were in line with, or slightly better than, expectations.    Like other insurance concerns, Transamerica was hurt by ongoing price-cutting in the property and casualty insurance markets. Earnings from property and casualty operations decreased in the quarter, due to lower-than-expected growth in premiums, the company said.    Transamerica, however, is more diversified than most insurance concerns, making it somewhat less vulnerable to the downturn in the property and casualty sectors. In addition, most of Transamerica's insurance business is centered on life insurance, which tends to be more stable, Gloria Vogel, an analyst with Bear Stearns andamp; Co., said.    In the quarter, property and casualty insurance accounted for less than 20% of the company's earnings, while life insurance accounted for about 40%, the company said. Transamerica said its life-insurance operations posted record earnings in the quarter.    Third-quarter results also reflected the settlement of a tax issue, which resulted in the company's federal income tax being reduced $30 million, Transamerica said. The quarter also included a $14 million write-down for costs associated with the company's credit-insurance business. The company recently announced plans to discontinue that line.    Transamerica said it expects competitive price-cutting in property and casualty insurance, and a continuing slowdown in real estate to pose &quot;serious challenges&quot; in the current quarter and next year. The company said it is switching emphasis away from standard property and casualty lines toward more specialty lines, such as workers' compensation and collateral protection.    The company said it still expects full-year 1988 operating earnings to set a record. The company wasn't more specific. Bear Stearns's Ms. Vogel estimates Transamerica will post 1988 operating earnings of about $324 million, or $4.30 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
