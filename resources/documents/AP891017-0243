(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Control Data Corp. on Tuesdayannounced development of a mainframe computer it expects to beginshipping in the second half of 1990.   The Cyber 2000 is a $2.3 million machine that eventually willreplace its biggest mainframe, the Cyber 990. The new machine,based on Control Data's own proprietary technology, will have twicethe computing power of its predecessors, the company said.   The computer company also announced a technology-sharingagreement with MIPS Computer Systems Inc. of Sunnyvale, Calif., todesign the brains of its future computers.   The joint development agreement with MIPS means Control Datawill use a streamlined chip design known as Reduced Instruction SetComputing, or RISC, developed by that firm. That is a departurefrom using chips of the company's own design.   As early as next year, Control Data expects to be sellingspecialized computers based on the technology but it also willconduct joint development of projects further in the future, saidE. J. Otis, senior vice president.   ``As we move forward, RISC technology will pervade all CDCprojects,'' Otis said.   RISC computer chips cannot carry out all the functions of moregeneral-purpose chips that have traditionally been the centralprocessors in computers. But they are faster and are gainingacceptance for computers performing intensive numerical operationsor producing sophisticated graphics.   The move by Control Data is related to the layoff of 95 researchand development people last week at Control Data's Arden Hillsfacility. Because the company will rely on someone else to designthe central processing chips of future computers, it no longerneeds the employees who have been designing its own proprietarychips.   ``In agreeing to obtain that technology, Control Data isrecognizing that they can't do it all,'' said analyst Gary Smaby ofthe Smaby Group in Minneapolis.   As for the new mainframe computer, Smaby said, ``It keeps themin the ball game. ... A lot of people out there had thought theyhad fallen so far behind they couldn't get back in anymore.''</TEXT></DOC>
