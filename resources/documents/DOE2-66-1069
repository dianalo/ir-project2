<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-66-1069 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Government of Egypt (GOE), jointly with USAID/Cairo, is conductinga renewable energy field testing program in an effort to determine thefeasibility of supplementing conventional sources of energy with renewablesources. Wind energy is just one of the renewable energy sources thatis being tested in this program. A feasible wind energy resource haslong been recognized in certain regions of Egypt. An important step inthe current field testing program is quantifying the extent of Egypt'swind resources using existing data. The existence of this resource isthen verified through onsite wind monitoring at key locations where windenergy applications are feasible. This paper summarizes these two activitiesthat have been conducted jointly by Battelle, Pacific Northwest Laboratories(under sponsorship of USAID/Cairo) and the Egyptian Electricity Authority(EEA).</TEXT></DOC>
