<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-64-0122 </DOCNO><TEXT>A continuous bioreactor where cells were recycled using a cross-flow microfiltration(CFM) membrane plant was investigated for the production of solvents(ABE fermentation) from whey permeate using Clostridium acetobutylicumP262. A tubular CFM membrane plant capable of being backflushed was used.The continuous fermentations were characterized by cyclic solventogenicand acidogenic behaviour, and ultimately degenerated to an acidogenicstate. Steady-state solvent production was obtained for only short periods.This degeneration is attributed to the complex morphological behaviourof this strain of organism on this substrate. It is postulated that toachieve steady-state solvent production over extended periods of time,it is necessary to maintain a balance among the various morphologicalcell forms, i.e. acid-producing vegetative cells, solvent-producing clostridialcells, and inert forms, e.g. spores.</TEXT></DOC>
