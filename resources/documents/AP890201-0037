That uneasiness seems to have intensified now that a far-rightparty which suggests foreigners do not belong in West Germany haswon seats in the city's legislature _ its first electoral victory onthe state level.   Turks and other non-Germans living in this city are worried bythe Republicans' sudden emergence as a serious political party.   ``The Republicans did not win so many seats in the legislature,but we are very concerned they could become stronger in thefuture,'' said Zafer Oeztuerk, a university student from Turkey.   West Berlin has a reputation for a liberal attitude toward thenon-Germans who stream into the city, and many Berliners took to thestreets to express dismay after the Republicans captured 7.5 percentof Sunday's vote, or 11 of the legislature's 134 seats.   An estimated 15,000 people protested outside City Hall on Monday,demanding the outlawing of the 5-year-old party, whose nationalchairman is former Nazi SS soldier Franz Schoenhuber.   Many conservative West Berliners, however, say they have nothingagainst foreigners but believe it unfair to give non-Germans jobsand apartments when the city has a housing shortage and 11 percentunemployment.   Analysts think the Republicans were able to pick up so many votesbecause the governing Christian Democrats have failed to addresstheir conservative constituents' concerns about the growing numberof foreigners _ mostly Turks _ who are competing with Germans forjobs, housing and social services.   ``It appears that the vote for the Republicans was more of aprotest vote,'' Richard Stoess, a political scientist at WestBerlin's Free University told the Berlin Morgenpost newspaper.   An estimated 262,000 foreigners live in West Berlin, a city of 2million residents surrounded by East Germany. More than half areTurks.   Many of the Turks live in Southeast 36, a section of the hugeworking-class Kreuzberg district that a visitor might mistake forIstanbul if not for the German cars and tavern signs advertisinglocal beers.   Women draped in traditional shawls ply the sidewalk outside drabshops and ethnic food stores, bantering with clerks and customers inTurkish.   Turks who live in West Berlin say they were shocked when theyheard the Republicans had won seats in the legislature, and angrilydefend their right to live in the city.   ``We couldn't believe this happened,'' said Tuncay Yueksel, whoruns a Turkish bakery. ``I am a German, and so are my wife andchildren. We belong here,'' he said in fluent German.   Yueksel said Germans and Turks live alongside each other inSoutheast 36 and get along well, a feeling echoed by a German man ata neighborhood cafe.   But a middle-aged German grocer said ``there are too manyforeigners''   She said she had voted for the Republicans.   ``This neighborhood was once all German, but they started movingout when Turks started moving in. We've become foreigners here, inour own neighborhood,'' she said.   ``Look, I am certainly not a Nazi, and the Republicans are notNazis either. I was only a child when Hitler was in power, but Iknow those were bad times,'' said the woman.   ``But the Republicans were saying the right things. It's notright when foreigners collect social assistance that we provide withour taxes.''   The woman refused to give her name, saying, ``That could be badfor my business.''   The election has unified West Berlin's non-Germans.   ``I think it's really odd that so many conservative Germanstravel to Turkey for their vacations, get their suntans and thenreturn home saying the Turks have to go,'' said Abdel Nasser Assal,a young Egyptian taxi driver.   He also rejected suggestions that foreigners are stealing jobsfrom Germans:   ``The foreigners who come here have to take jobs the Germansdon't want,'' said Assal. ``It's rare that you find Germans liningup for work as maids, dishwashers and domestic servants. Those jobsare left to the foreigners.''</TEXT></DOC>
