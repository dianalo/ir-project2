It is particularly focussedon the application of the technique to medical diagnosis including analysisof elements contained in tissue in the kidney, bladder, liver and brain.In the particle induced X-ray emission technique, accelerated chargedparticled (ions) are applied to a sample to expel inner-shell electrons,and resultant characteristic X-rays are detected and measured to determinethe type and quantity of elements contained in the sample. Scanning ofa section of the kidney shows that the content of Cu, Mn, Ca, Zn, Feand Cd shifts at the boundary between the kidney and marrow. In particular,the Fe content is extremely low in an active cancer portion. In the bladder,clear difference in the Ca, Zn and Ti contents are seen between a cancerportion and the normal portion. Particle induced X-ray emission is especiallysuitable for microanalysis of the liver because the organ contains ahigh content of heavy elements. The technique is also effective for analyzingvarious elements including iodine in the thyroid. (Nogami, K.).</TEXT></DOC>
