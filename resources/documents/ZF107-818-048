(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>NUMONICS CORP. Numonics 2206 GraphicMaster ZedPEN Numonics has moved up froman undistinguished position in the tablet market to a solid number three in anewfangled way--merges and acquisitions.andP;  In June 1987 it acquired Pencept;in October 1987 it added mouse-maker Torrington to its assets; and in Aprilof this year it joined with Terminal Display Systems, England's onlytable-maker.andM;These three products give glimpses of that evolution.andP;  ZedPEN represents anovel technology added through the merger with TDS.andP;  The Numonics 2206 is therecent outgrowth of a proven line of Numonics tables.andP;  The GraphicMaster is arevolutionary new offering crafted by Pencept that pits Numonics squarelyagainst the latest and best the tablet market has to offer.andM;Introduced in October 1988, the $595 Numonics 2206 combines the best featuresof the company's 2205 (introduced in April 1987) and 2207 (introduced inApril 1988), specifically, the quality and features of the former and thetrimmer styling and downloadable commands of the latter.andM;While the combination is a good one, it's definitely dated.andP;  The result isstill a big, heavy, pad measuring 23 by 23 inches and 1 inch thick.andP;  Coveredin white-beige plastic, it's built on a solid black metal foundation.andP;  Thetop surface is unmarked except for the Numonics logo and model number.andP;  Teh20.5- by 20.5-inch active area is not indicated in any way.andM;The tablet draws its electricity from a large black brick transformer thatburrows into a wall outlet, supplying 500 milliamps of 5 volts DC and 130milliamps of 12 VDC through its 78-inch cord.andP;  Numonics also supplies a112-inch serial cable with the 2206, terminal in either a 9-pin D-shell (forATs) or a 25-pin D-shel; you choose when you order.andM;The 2206 tablet provides two jacks on its rear panel that allow you to plugin both a cursor and pen at the same time.andP;  It generally recognizes whicheverone is closer to the tablet.andM;The four-button cursor looks like a Transformer stolen from a child's toybox; it has a dark gray angular case with inset finger grips at either side.andO;The 2.25- by 3.12- by 0.75-inch case is extended by a 1.5-inch reticle with asmall central circle not pierced by the plus-shaped hairlines.andP;  It's easy tograsp but forces your fingers into a pincerlike grip that may not becomfortable for long periods.andP;  The cursor is available in one- andfour-button models for $ 105, a 16-button version for $205, and a number ofother variants.andM;The pen, 1.5 inches around and 6 inches long, is a fat imitation of afountain pen.andP;  Although its plastic case feels a little slippery, it is easyenough to use.andP;  The inkless cartridge supplied by Numonics was molded fromnylon; its almost dangerously sharp point quickly wears down to a smooth tipafter a few minutes of use.andM;The $65 pen uses a tip-switch as its only control.andP;  For an additionalbarrel-mounted button, you'll have to spend $75 for the two-switch pen.andP;  Allpointing devices for the 2206 are equipped with 36-inch cables.andM;Neither cursor nor pen demonstrated much proximity range.andP;  The pen wasreliably detected at .25 inch; the cursor, at .37 inch.andP;  One feature we weredelighted to find defeatable was the beep emitted by the tablet every time apoint was indicated.andP;  Worse than the headache it caused, the beep slowed downresponse.andP;  Although the on-screen cursor moved rapidly, when points werespecified in quick succession, often several would be lost because of beepingoverhead.andP;  Turn off the beep, and the 2206 keeps up with the quickest AutoCADdrawing.andM;The setup of the 2206 is probably its most retrograde feature.andP;  To get the2206 working, you must first adjust a bank of DIP switches on the rear panelto set serial speed and emulation mode, a process that is not helped much bya little pamphlet Numonics calls a user guide.andP;  We found (throughexperimentation, not through the pamphlet) that AutoCAD worked best with the2206 in Summagraphics MM emulation, but the tablet yielded a modest 9.5-by10-inch pad to cover the active drawing screen.andM;On the positive side, the 2206 is supplied with two disks of software thatinclude ADI, mouse, and Microsoft Windows drivers in addition to diagnosticsand field support.andM;THE GRAPHICMASTERandM;While the 2206 is evolutionary, the GraphicMaster is revolutionary, at leastfor Numonics.andP;  Because it's essentially a minimalist pad, it's a mostdesirable tablet.andP;  Heft the 15- by 15- by 1-inch tablet, and you'll thinkthat there's almost nothing in your hands.andP;  The pad is only a thin sheet ofplastic with a raised honeycomb of reinforcing ridges on the bottom.andP;  Atabout 2.25 pounds, it would be perfect for use on your lap if the ridgesdidn't do a meatcutter's job on your legs.andM;Underneath the tablet is a small area about the size of an index card thatholds all of the electronics of the unit.andP;  On the right side of theelectronics box are a jack to plug in the cursor and an LED to indicate modechanges.andM;The light weight of the pad is complemented by the relative freedom of havingonly one tether besides the cursor cable.andP;  Both power and signal travelthrough the same 81-inch cable.andP;  A 9-pin D-shell connector plugs into theback of the tablet, and a 25-pin D-shell is included for plugging into yourown serial port.andP;  The GraphicMaster draws all the power it needs through theserial connection.andM;The menu system built into the electronics is activated by unplugging thecursor (or pen), holding down one of its buttons, then plugging it back inwhile keeping your finger on the button for two flashes of the LED indicatoron the side.andP;  The placement of this LED is a design error--it should be ontop of the tablet where it can be seen.andM;After the flashes, the tablet itself becomes a selector--move the cursor tothe emulation or operating mode you desire from those printed on the cheappaper menu template supplied with the tablet, then click.andP;  Emulations includeNumonics, BPI, Summagraphics MM and Delta, Microsoft Mouse, and ASCIIcharacters.andP;  As vital as this setup template is, it should be laminated orprinted on something more substantial than the paper that was supplied withthe unit we investigated.andM;The GraphicMaster tablet works quite well, and it proved more than up to thespeed required for AutoCAD with its 160-point-per-second maximum drawingspeed.andP;  The range of its sensors was large, losing proximity only after thecursor was withdrawn 2 inches away from the tablet.andP;  At that point it becameunstable and sent a jittery stream of data, with the indicated cursorposition varying wildly until contact was lost.andP;  Resolution reaches the 1,000lines per inch common among tablets.andP;  Accuracy is rated at 0.01 inch.andM;The four-button cursor accompanying the GraphicMaster has a 40-inch cord.andO;Although shaped like a mouse, it's somewhat smaller (2.25 by 3.25 by 0.5inches with a 1.5-inch paddle) and the buttons require curling your hand intoan uncomfortable grip.andP;  The four blue buttons of the standard cursor arearranged in an inverted T, and the reticle is a pair of cross hairs with asmall central target circle.andM;Slightly streamlined, the GraphicMastr pen is among the more comfortable pensto hold.andP;  The pen features a tip-switch and a sharp nylon uninked tip muchlike that of the 2206.andM;GraphicMaster pointing devices arrived with 40-inch cables ending inthree-conductor miniature phone plugs.andP;  A 16-button cursor is available as asubstitute for the combination of 4-button cursor and pen that's supplied asstandard equipment.andP;  The tablet includes a Microsoft Mouse emulator, aWindows driver, and an AutoCAD ADI driver in addition to its diagnostics andmaintenance routines.andM;THE ZEDPENandM;The ZedPEN system looks radically different from the rest of the Numonicsline and most other tablets that find their way to these shores, probablybecause it comes from across the Atlantic, where Terminal Display Systems isthe leading tablet vendor.andP;  The ZedPEN was the first product there to add athird dimension to tablet digitization.andP;  In England, what we call zee--as inz-coordinate--is pronounced zed, hence the name ZedPEN.andM;The tablet reflects another transatlantic difference.andP;  In America, the 12- by12-inch tablet is tops; in Britain, it's the 12- by 17-inch size (standardsA4 and A3, respectively).andP;  The tablet received for review, an A3, is thushefty and expensive by U.S.andP;  standards: 14.5 pounds and $1,955.andP;  ZedPEN isalso available in the smaller A4 format for $1,600.andM;The ZedPEN tablet is a white lucite wedge measuring 21.5 by 16.25 inches andrising from just under one inch at the front edge to a little over 2.5 inchesat the rear.andP;  The drawing surface, with a 17.5- by 12.73-inch active area, isset off by a border about an inch wide around the tablet, a little wider onthe right edge where there is a shallow trench for resting your pen.andM;On the back panel you find the connector to plug in the pen, a 12-VDC inputto power the tablet, a red indicator LED, a small (.1 inch) reset button, twoserial ports that use 25-pin D-shell connectors, and a 9-pin D-shellconnector for the ZedPEN itself.andP;  All of the connectors are recessed about 2inches under top of the tablet so that the connectors stay out of your way.andO;The external transformer connects through a generous 112-inch cord, and theserial cable provided is even longer at 127 inches.andM;The ZedPEN pen is finished in brushed stainless steel and measures about 1.5inches in circumference and 6 inches long.andP;  Although the steel makes itsturdy, the pen feels somewhat slippery.andP;  Because of the design of itssensory mechanism, ink cartridges cannot be loaded.andM;The entire ZedPEN system is self-programmed using the pen, tablet, andstandard setup template.andP;  Press the reset button on the back of the tabletand it enters its setup mode.andP;  All you need to do to select mode or emulationis press the pen against the appropriate menu choice.andP;  Nonvolatile memorywithin the tablet remembers your choice.andP;  However, setting up the tablet isan act of faith because it yields no visual indication of its settings oreven that a setting has been accepted and updated.andM;The proximity range of the system proved modest, only about 0.25 inch.andP;  Thesystem is quick enough to draw points as fast as you can press them intoAutoCAD.andM;The distinctive feature of the ZedPEN is its pressure sensitivity.andP;  The forceapplied to the pen tip is digitized and transmitted to the pad's computerhost for use as applications see fit.andP;  The ZedPEN distinguishes 128 discretepressure levels.andP;  At one time, the ZedPEN system was the onlypressure-sensitive tablet available.andP;  Now it is showing its age (three years)as 256-level pressure pens and cordless pressure pens increasingly becomeavailable.andM;The ZedPEN is still a workable choice for applications that call for an extradimension.andP;  However, it may no longer be the best choice.andP;  The same is trueof Numonics 2206.andP;  The GraphicMaster, however, can hold its own against thebest of them.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
