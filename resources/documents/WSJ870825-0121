The auto maker, which said it will introduce the cars in late 1989 as 1990 models, becomes the third Japanese auto maker to opt for a so-called &quot;second channel&quot; of dealers to highlight a new line of cars. Honda Motor Co. introduced its Legend and Integra luxury cars in the U.S. in 1986 through a new dealer network called Acura. And just last month, Nissan Motor Corp. announced plans for a new line of upscale cars that, starting in 1989, it will market under the new Infiniti label.    Toyota, however, will face competition from more than just its Japanese rivals. The number of foreign-made and domestically built luxury models sold in the U.S. has rocketed in recent years and, now, consumers shopping in that segment can pick from nearly 60 different vehicles.    Competition has become so heated that BMW of North America Inc., a unit of Bayerische Motoren Werke AG, and Mercedes-Benz of North America Inc., a unit of Daimler-Benz AG, recently announced sales incentives to help trim excess inventory -- a rare move for the two West German luxury-car makers.    Toyota hopes its upscale line will help it hang on to current customers who have had to look elsewhere when trading up to luxury cars, and says it isn't worried about the crowded market. &quot;We think that, by the types of dealers we select, by the customer satisfaction programs we put together, we will separate ourselves from the rest of the marketplace,&quot; said J. Davis Illingworth, corporate manager of the Lexus Division of Toyota Motor Sales, the auto maker's Torrance, Calif.-based U.S. sales arm.    Toyota said it will market two vehicles, built in Japan, under the Lexus label: a four-door, eight-cylinder luxury sedan and a &quot;near-luxury,&quot; four-door, six-cylinder car that will be lower in price than the luxury sedan. The company declined to elaborate on the vehicles' prices, but one industry estimate had the two cars at about $30,000 and $20,000, respectively.    The luxury car will be a new vehicle, but the near-luxury model will be &quot;reworked&quot; for the U.S. market from a vehicle Toyota currently sells elsewhere in the world, Mr. Illingworth said. He declined to give details.    Toyota said it will start with fewer than 100 dealers for the two cars. It said the dealers, who will be picked from inside and outside Toyota's current rank of 1,085 U.S. dealers, will be situated in the top 50 markets in the U.S. -- markets that can sustain sales of luxury cars -- and will have to demonstrate a record of customer satisfaction.    The auto maker plans to require this first group of dealers to have facilities for the Lexus cars totally separate from their current car lines. That strategy is common for auto makers setting up separate dealer networks and is meant, among other things, to make buyers of the upscale cars feel special and to underscore the exclusive ambiance of the luxury market.    But some dealers have voiced skepticism about the practice, noting that sales of new luxury-car lines may not be big enough to support the expense -- often millions of dollars -- of separate facilities. Indeed, Toyota said it expects to sell only 30,000 of the vehicles in the first model year.    Aside from hanging on to current customers, the Lexus luxury line could help boost Toyota's earnings, if it proves popular. Luxury cars, loaded as they are with expensive options, tend to be more profitable than smaller, less-expensive vehicles.    As far as U.S. market share is concerned, though, Lexus will be of little help to Toyota, at least initially. In just the first seven months of 1987, Toyota sold 317,723 vehicles in the U.S. -- more than 10 times what Lexus hopes to sell in its first year. </TEXT></DOC>
