Kellog'sslip-form method at the occasion of expansion work of the No.3 unit inthe Hirono Thermal Power Station of Tokyo Electric Power Co. A concreteblending plan was established for the work with attention paid on thecompression strength of young age concrete and test mixing was performedbased on the plan. The compression strength was also controlled accordingto the plan. Twelve types of concrete were blended. The constructionwork is carried out by the two-shift organization of daytime and nightgroups. The slip-form work is conducted from the mid-March to mid-June.The compression strength of young age concrete was controlled by thecumulative curing temperature, compression test, and touch-sending. Theconstruction could be topped out 5 days earlier than schedule as an adequatework plan was established with the sufficient attention paid on the youngage strength of concrete and the slip-form construction went so favorablythat the maximum rising speed of 6 m/day was achieved.
