Rep. Robert Dornan spoke up to ask about the Arias peace plan, but Mr. Shultz ignored the question and announced that he'd just signed his own peace plan with House Speaker Jim Wright.    The president, who had criticized Mr. Wright only a day earlier, looked as surprised as everyone else as Mr. Shultz explained how the speaker had generously agreed to stop moonlighting as secretary of state. &quot;Jim Wright was off the reservation, but now he's back on,&quot; claimed Mr. Shultz.    Over on the Hill, however, Mr. Wright was offering a few conciliatory noises but no concessions on principle. Asked by reporters whether he had agreed to stop seeing the parties to the Nicaraguan peace process, Mr. Wright replied crisply, &quot;No.&quot;    The cliche of the season is that everyone in Washington should &quot;compromise,&quot; but someone obviously hasn't told the speaker. From his first day in charge, Mr. Wright has been fighting with a bareknuckles partisanship that has many members -- Republicans and even a few Democrats -- recalling fondly the partisan rule of Tip O'Neill.    And why not? If the speaker's plunge into Central American diplomacy is any guide, the bareknuckle strategy is working beautifully. Mr. Wright made progress toward a preeminent Democratic goal -- defunding the Contras without having to take responsibility for what might happen later in Central America. He conferred on Nicaraguan President Ortega a sincerity the Reagan administration wouldn't confer. He also made it even less likely that Congress will grant new aid to the Contras while the Arias plan puts Mr. Ortega's sincerity to the test. Mr. Wright did draw fire for stepping too far into the State Department's territory, but that sputtered once the ever-congenial Mr. Shultz absolved him.    Mr. Wright can't take all the credit for the Democrats' new partisan ascendency, of course. The speaker has, over the past few years, cleverly ridden to power on the backs of the left-liberal alliance that now dominates the House Democratic Caucus. Himself a politician of the older school of spend and elect, Mr. Wright has learned painfully where the new balance of power lies. After he failed to oppose the Contras with sufficient vigor in 1983, activist Democrats pulled him aside and made it clear he'd never be speaker unless he spoke for the liberal majority. Frustrated for six years by President Reagan, that majority is now scrambling to reassert itself with special ferocity.    So in Mr. Wright the Democratic House may have found its perfect leader -- a liberal with a temper. Street-fighting comes naturally to him. As majority leader a couple of years back, Mr. Wright threatened to punch out Republican Dan Lungren when he rushed the chair to complain about debate closure. Republican whip Trent Lott calls his speakership &quot;streetball at its ugliest.&quot;    Did someone say &quot;bipartisanship?&quot; Mr. Wright's contribution to the budget summit was to charge through the House a budget reconciliation containing $12 billion in new taxes. &quot;I thought it was unfortunate,&quot; says Rep. Timothy Penny, a moderate Democrat who voted against the bill. &quot;We'd waited five years for the president to agree to a summit . . . and when we finally get him to the table we insist on pushing a strictly partisan bill.&quot;    The bill nearly failed, of course, only because of principled moderates like Mr. Penny. Some liberal Democrats also bailed out because the bill contained too little new spending and too few new taxes. &quot;There are some in the caucus who believe that the 1981 tax cuts should never have been made,&quot; explains Mr. Penny, &quot;and that it's up to us to do anything to get every dollar back.&quot;    Mr. Wright also isn't above procedural arm-twisting. Ten years ago only 10% of all House rules were &quot;restricted,&quot; with limits on amendments and debate. So far this year more than 40% of all rules have been restricted, usually to prevent the GOP from offering certain amendments or extending debate. To pass the budget-reconciliation bill after it had first failed, Mr. Wright declared an entirely new legislative day -- the only time that procedure has ever been used as a partisan weapon.    Speaker Wright has been at his brazen best, however, in butting into the Central American peace plan. Through the opening created by the famous Wright-Reagan plan, he's managed to steal the initiative from the administration, and he's used it ruthlessly since to try to bury the Contras. This past week he even offered four of his own anti-Contra associates to assist Cardinal Obando y Bravo, who is supposed to mediate between the Contras and the Sandinistas. When public criticism finally forced him to back down a little, the speaker then made sure he used every forum he could to denounce Elliott Abrams, the State Department's leading pro-Contra official.    Three of the same Republicans who visited President Reagan on Tuesday also met with Speaker Wright later the same day. Rep. Dan Burton asked the speaker whether he'll support aid for the Contras if the Sandinistas fail to make enough progress toward liberalization by the Arias plan's deadline in January. The speaker changed the subject.    ---   Mr. Gigot is a member of the Journal's editorial board. </TEXT></DOC>
