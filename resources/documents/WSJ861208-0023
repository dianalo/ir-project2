Ross Perot, the Dallas billionaire.    He will be introduced by Roger B. Smith, chairman of General Motors Corp. It was only a week ago that the two men decided that GM, big as it is, wasn't big enough for both of them. The speech was arranged months before the Smith-Perot split.    The crowd will be the largest in the history of the prestigious club -- topping the 6,800 President Reagan drew in 1982. Two radio stations here will carry live broadcasts, and some 100 journalists requested coverage credentials.    In the past week Mr. Perot has appeared on network talk shows galore, and he says that he's been fielding hundreds of calls and piles of letters from GM shareholders angry about the company's buyout of his stock.    Mr. Perot's speech may be tempered by the buyout accord with GM that bars criticism of the company under pain of as much as $7.5 million in penalties. Nonetheless, says a GM spokesman, &quot;I can't imagine you'll have Ross Perot come in and not say what's on his mind.&quot; Mr. Perot says that he won't disappoint the crowd, adding cryptically, &quot;You won't be throwing rolls at me when I leave.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
