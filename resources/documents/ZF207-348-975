 New DBMSs include ButtonWare'slatest shareware ($89.95) PC-FILE:dB version 1.0, Raima Corp's$695 db__Vista, Progress Software's $1000-plus Progress 4GL andrelational DBMS, Microrim's $895 R:BASE Compiler, and RevelationTechnologies' $950 Advanced Revelation-SQL.andP;  Fourth-generationlanguage (4GL) environments promoted included MDP International's$695 Sculptor, Informix's $395 developers package for Informix-4GLand Informix-SQL, and PDS-Adept.andP;  New computer-aided softwareengineering (CASE) tools include Syscorp International's $5,000MicroSTEP, Computer Systems Advisers' POSE tool kits, Maxem Corp's$495-plus CAUSE tools, and Softools $1,495 CASE:W.andP;  Several otherproducts are also briefly described.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Comdex-FallTrade ShowsRelational DBMSFourth-Generation LanguagesComputer-Aided Software EngineeringPromotion of Product.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Rush HourandM;I flew into Las Vegas armed with two assignments: to interview individualsfrom the Novell Netware SQL team (you can read about that elsewhere in thisissue), and to report on anything outside the dBASE and workalike world thatmight interest the readers of Data Based Advisor.andP;  And I had a whole day anda half to do it in.andP;  So, since I experienced the show at breakneck speed, Ithink you should too.andP;  Here it is, organized by category (which is more thanI had for my tour...).andM;dQueryandM;Quadbase Systems sells a variety of products, and you may have heard or readabout dQuery, an SQL/QBE engine that sells for $150.andP;  (See Manju Bewtra'sreview, &quot;Getting Answers&quot; in the Nov. 1988 issue.)andP;  dQuery is an interactivequery management system that lets users make SQL (Structured Query Language)queries or use QBE (query by example) commands for ad hoc queries, reportwriting, and database (re)definition.andP;  dQuery requires 450K and a multiuserversion ($495 for up to five users) is available.andP;  dQuery will work not onlywith dBASE and Lotus files but also with ASCII files, and you can have up to32 open at a time.andP;  dQuery uses windoes and pull-doen menus, as you can seefrom Fig.andP;  1, and comes with a report generator.andM;Although dQuery is not trivial to learn, I can see it being used bysophisticated end users willing to learn this powerful access tool thatallows them to query varieties of data.andP;  More likely, however, applicationsdevelopers may want to harness its scripting power.andP;  Quadbase also sellsdQuery/Lib, an API (Application Program Interface) set of routines that allowC programmers to access the dQuery engine.andP;  Contact Quadbase Systems at 790Lucerne Drive, Suite 51, Sunnyvale, Calif.andP;  94086, phone (408) 738-6989.andM;dbPublisherandM;dbPublisher, an exciting, unique package, combines word processing power withthe features we expect from database report generators.andP;  dbPublisher willimport data directly from dBase and workalikes, R:BASE, 1-2-3, Symphony,Supercalc, Multiplan, Ability, DIF, ASCII, WordPerfect, graphics packagessupporting EPS, PCX, PIC, IMG, HPGL, or TIFF formats, and even from multiplerelated databases.andP;  dbPublisher ($695) includes typographic controls, barcode generation, and a variety of financial and statistical built-infunctions, and supports user-defined style guides and support for more that1,000 fonts.andP;  Hardware requirements include an AT with 640K and a Hercules orbetter video system.andP;  A 20M hard disk and mouse are recommended.andP;  For moreinformation, contact Digital Composition Systems, 1715 West Northern,Phoenix, Ariz.andP;  85021, phone (602) 870-7667.andM;Logic GemandM;Logic Gem, billed as a &quot;spreadsheet for program logic,&quot; is another uniquepackage-one that should perhaps be listed in the CASE tools category sinceone of its functions is code (C, BASIC, FORTRAN, Pascal, dBASE, or English)generation.andP;  The underlying structure of Logic Gem is the logic table.andP;  Ifyou're not that familiar with logic tables, but have an interest in exploringhow expert systems might work as front ends to databases, this might be theplace to start for only $198.andM;Logic Gem requires 640K and an EGA, ANSI compatible, or otherwisewell-behaved monitor that correctly interprets BIOS video calls.andP;  For moreinformation, contact Sterling Castle at 702 Washington Street, Suite 174,Marina Del Rey, Calif.andP;  90292, phone (213) 306-3020.andM;Databases that supportandM;graphics: PC AlbumandM;PC Album is an image database management system that includes an applicationlanguage.andP;  Hardware requirements include an AT with at least 512K and a harddisk (optical disks are also supported), a color analog monitor and a videocapture board.andP;  Images can be captured directly via video cameras, videodisk, or VCRs, and are stored in Targa or DTI format - depending on the videocapture board.andP;  Utilities for cropping and compression are included.andP;  formore information, contact PCM, Inc., 8330 Boone Boulevard, Suite 430, Vienna,Virginia 22180, phone (800) 654-5845 or (703) 356-4600 in Virginia.andM;Database managers:andM;PC-File:dBandM;Buttonware launched its newest shareware version of PC-File, PC-File:dBversion 1.0.andP;  It's now dBASE-file compatible and can be used on a LAN.andO;Because of the new file format and data types, users of earlier version ofPC-File will have to use the FCONVERT program to update existing databases.andO;Reports created with PC-File can still be used.andP;  PC-File fans will be glad toknow that this newest version of PC-File maintains its familiar &quot;look andfeel&quot; and has not reverted to a dot prompt.andM;The graphing module has been significantly enhanced with support for plottingmultiple variables, multiple pies, exploding pies, log scales, and stackedbard.andP;  PC-File:dB supports up to 10 indexes and 1 billion records, and canhave memo fields up to 5,000 characters long.andP;  The report writer now supportsconditional processing with IF ...andP;  ELSE ...andP;  ENDIF statements.andP;  Registrationremains a modest $89.95.andP;  The program requires 416K and a hard disk.andP;  Formore information, contact ButtonWare at P.O.

systemrequirements in terms of icons, e.g., screen activity, database, report, orprocess and have them automatically analyzed for consistency.andP;  In the middle,developers can design forms, reports, and help screens for theirapplications.andP;  At the back end, out comes C code.andP;  Although the currentversion of MicroSTEP doesn't support embedded SQL, we can rest assured thatthe next one will, along with customizable icons.andP;  Other plans includesupport for Presentation Manager and a trend towards object-orientedprogramming.andP;  MicroSTEP is the fruit of a four-year development project ledby Dr. Raymond Yeh, president and CEO of Syscrop.andM;Peat Marwick andamp; Co. was so impressed with MicroSTEP that it formed a jointbusiness relationship with Systcorp, whereby Peat Marwick will providetraining and development assistance.andP;  MicroSTEP ($5,000) requires at least anAT with 640K, a 20M hard disk, a Microsoft-compatible mouse, and an EGA orHercules video system.andP;  For more information, contact Syscorp International,9420 Research, Suite 200, Austin, Texas 98759, phone (512) 338-0591.andM;POSEandM;Computer Systems Advisers has a modular front end CASE tool called POSE(Picture Oriented Software Engineering) that supports both data-driven andprocess-driven design needs.andP;  An integrated Data Model Tool Kit ($895)includes the Data Model Diagrammer(DMD), the Data Model Normalizer (DMN), theLogical Database Designer (LDD), and the Data Base Aid (DBA).andP;  It outputslogical designs for DB2, SQL/DS, or ADABASE.andP;  On the other hand, if youprefer the Process Model Tool Kit (also $895), you'll get the Data FlowDiagrammer (DFD), Structure Chart Diagrammer (SCD), Decomposition Diagrammer(DCD), and Action Chart Diagrammer (ACD).andP;  Any of the modules is availableseparately for $295.andP;  POSE can run on a simple PC with at least 512K and aCGA or higher video card, and a Microsoft or PC-Mouse style mouse andincludes support for popular printers, including lasers.andP;
