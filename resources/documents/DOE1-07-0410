Energy strategy for the nextcentury must be carefully planned to minimize the impact on the criticalresources of soil, water and air. In particular, if the nuclear energyoption is to be considered as one which can make a long-term contributionto energy needs, the problem of waste disposal must be solved. The selectionof disposal sites involves complex geological-sociological factors butthere are grounds for optimism in the new geochemical techniques whichare becoming established. (U.K.).</TEXT></DOC>
