Batch reactor experiments were carried out to evaluatethe effectiveness of seven model nitrogen compounds in promoting coalconversion and distillate production at low severity reaction conditions.Addition of dipropylamine and 1,2,3,4-tetrahydroquinoline to Cold Lakeatmospheric residuum improved Kentucky 9 coal conversion by 53 wt % and41 wt %, respectively, with minimal nitrogen incorporation or thermaldegradation losses. Reaction severity was found to strongly influencedistillate yield and nitrogen incorporation, but impacted coal conversionto a much lesser extent. This observation suggests the use of a low severitycoal dissolution step promoted by nitrogen compound addition followedby a catalytic upgrading step to maximize distillate yield. 27 refs.,4 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
