The wounded insurance holding company also said that theSecurities and Exchange Commission has opened a formalinvestigation of possible securities violations by thecompany.</LP><TEXT>   In its annual report, First Executive said Californiaregulators have compelled the company's principal unit,Executive Life Insurance Co., to refrain from junk bondpurchases and any major transactions with affiliates withoutthe prior approval of regulators.   Despite higher reserves than earlier announced forpotential bond portfolio losses, First Executive said theapproximate market value of its fixed-maturities investmentsremains about $1.5 billion below the $15.27 billion bookvalue.   With year-end assets of $19.2 billion, Los Angeles-basedFirst Executive is one of the nation's larger insurancecompanies. The company was for many years one of the largestpurchasers of junk bonds from Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.,now in bankruptcy proceedings.   In recent months, First Executive's financial woes havewidened, prompting a plunge in the company stock and atorrent of surrenders from policy holders. Yesterday, innational over-the-counter trading, First Executive commonclosed unchanged at $2.75 a share on volume of 961,500shares.   The $559 million of surrenders reported for the first twomonths of the year was substantially lower than someanalysts' had speculated. However, the closely watched paceof those surrenders was almost treble last year'salready-accelerated $1.3 billion in policy returns.   Just as troubled banks can be strained by a surge inwithdrawals, demands for policy returns pose substantialburdens on insurance companies. First Executive said it hasbeen &quot;encouraged&quot; lately by a decline in surrender requests.Also, analysts have been told that telephone calls seekinginformation about how to surrender policies have declined.However, the company warned that its announcements mayreverse that favorable trend.   First Executive said it believes it has sufficientliquidity to weather current spates of policy surrenders. AtMarch 23, cash and short-term investments totaled about $2.5billion, up from $2 billion at year end, the company said.   At the root of the company's larger-than-expected loss wasa surprising $344 million increase in the charge taken forprospective bond losses. In January, First Executive said itexpected to take a $515 million one-time charge, net oftaxes, to clean up the portfolio. However, with the increase,that charge totals $859 million.   Fred Carr, First Executive's chairman and chief executiveofficer, attributed the increase to &quot;further turmoil&quot; in thejunk-bond market after the company's January calculations.   With the charge, First Executive's fourth-quarter net losstotaled $835.7 million, or a loss of $9.98 a share, comparedwith net income of $48.2 million, or 42 cents a share, a yearearlier. Counting realized securities losses of $1.06 billionin the latest quarter, revenue was a negative $540.5 million,compared with $552.4 million the year earlier.   The latest quarter's results brought losses for the yearto $775.6 million, or $9.67 a share, compared with net incomea year earlier of $174.5 million, or $1.51 a share. Revenue,including realized securities losses of $1.06 billion, was$1.19 billion last year compared with $2.14 billion a yearearlier. All results for 1988 have been restated to reflectaccounting changes.   First Executive noted that the newly widened charges forbond losses in its publicly-reported numbers, based ongenerally-accepted accounting principles, don't requirechanges in recently reported year-end results to regulators.They are calculated on very different, statutory assumptions.   The SEC's investigation, titled &quot;In the Matter of FirstExecutive,&quot; was opened last month, according to the company,and deals with possible violations of securities laws sinceJune 1988, when First Executive announced plans for a $284million rights offering. The company said it was cooperatingwith the investigation, which supercedes an &quot;informal&quot; probebegun in January.   A company official declined to elaborate on theinvestigation. However, it is believed to focus on questionsof timely disclosure of material information, the absence ofwhich may have induced stock purchases at inflated prices.   Stock was sold in the rights sale at $15 a share inOctober. Within three months, First Executive disclosed its$515 million write-down and other woes. A number of civilsuits have been launched alleging securities violationsrelated to the rights offering. The company has said itsdisclosure was timely and accurate.   Other investigations also were disclosed, among theminquiries by the federal Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp. andthe Labor Department into the issue of annuities by ExecutiveLife related to pension terminations. The company's businessin this area was the subject of a page one article in thisnewspaper.   First Executive's disclosure of strictures by Californiaregulators suggests closer controls over its Executive Lifeunit than previously indicated. California's Department ofInsurance has placed permanent observers at the company.   Now, however, all new transactions with affiliates inamounts exceeding 2% of Executive Life's capital and surplusmust be approved in advance by regulators. At Dec. 31,Executive Life Insurance Co. had capital and surplus totaling$459.2 million, indicating that regulators require priorapproval of transactions of more than about $9 million.   Other factors also are impinging on First Executive. Thecompany said it obtained a waiver from banks for what mayhave been a technical default on about $275 million of debt.The prospective default involved the company's recentrepurchase of about $7.3 million of stock following itsfourth-quarter loss.   First Executive said it plans to seek an amendment toconvenants that would permit it to pay cash dividends andrepurchase stock in cases that aren't currently permitted.The company has never paid a cash dividend and now is barredfrom doing so under debt covenants.</TEXT></DOC>
