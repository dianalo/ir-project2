The department, which plans to release its report today, details how the space business will change by the year 2000. Growth in communications satellites, which have been the backbone of the business, will slow because of competition from ground-based fiber-optic cables. But rocket launches, which have traditionally been a government monopoly, will open up for private competitors.    Whatever the business, many competitors are ready to move in. The department'sstudy identifies at least 10 countries that have built launch facilities, including the Soviet Union, a space-age regular, and upstarts like India, Australia, Japan and Sweden.    These countries will be competing to supply services and large rockets for U.S. commercial and foreign launches totaling 15 to 25 satellites a year over the next decade, the study estimates. The major U.S. rocket vendors, McDonnell Douglas Corp., General Dynamics Corp. and Martin Marietta Corp., will compete for that business, and will get a large part of the U.S. Defense Department's rocket business, too.    The study said that the ability of U.S. companies to compete depends on maintaining the federal government policy -- adopted after the shuttle disaster -- of staying out of the commercial launch business. &quot;Any hint that the government might one day re-enter the commercial launch business would undercut {companies'} ability to raise capital for private commercial ventures,&quot; the report said.    Other space markets will also be crowded. The Commerce Department report identifies plans by various countries and private companies in the U.S. to build 13 space facilities of varying capabilities. Some of these will fly in conjunction with the U.S. space shuttle or space station. But all should be able to provide customers with the ability to do experiments in conditions of microgravity.    The study shies away from specific predictions about market size to avoid the kind of ecstatic -- and unrealized -- projections that have left investors exceptionally skeptical. But the department does predict that the world-wide market for remote sensing capabilities will reach a total of between $7.2 billion and $9 billion for the 10 years ending in 1997.    The U.S. pioneered the remote sensing market with its Landsat satellites, which study weather, minerals and crops. It has a particularly tough time in this market, though. In 1984, the government transferred Landsat to a private company called Earth Observation Satellite Corp. and then &quot;reneged&quot; on some financial commitments to the company to build new satellites, according to the Commerce report.    As a result, the report said, for several years the U.S. probably won't have any commercial remote sensing satellites in orbit. At the same time, eight other countries have remote-sensing satellites in orbit or plan to launch them. </TEXT></DOC>
