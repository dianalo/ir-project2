In a brief opinion, a three-judge panel of the U.S. CircuitCourt of Appeals here refused to grant America West's petition toreview the Transportation Department's approval of the merger.   America West contended that the merger will inhibit its abilityto expand to eastern cities.   But the court said ``America West's generalized allegationsabout flying eastward are neither causally related to thedepartment's final order nor redressable by reversal of the order.''   ``Even if the merger were overturned by the court, America Westwould be no better off because it has not identified any interestin serving any identified market actually affected by the merger,''the court said.   In a statement, America West's chairman, Edward R. Beauvais,said the company was disappointed by the decision.   ``We are in the process of reviewing the decision to determineour future course of action with respect to the case,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
