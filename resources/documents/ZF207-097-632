Basi, vice president of business development at ArtelCommunications Corp., Hudson, Mass., said computer vendors favor the FDDIstandard for 100-megabit/sec data transmission in a token-passing ringnetwork.andP;  On the other hand, telecommunications companies, such as theregional Bell operating companies, back the IEEE 802.6 and 802.9 standards,he said.andM;Though in early stages of development, the IEEE standards -- in contrast tothe FDDI standard for data transfer -- also will allow fo rvoicetransmission, with fiber likely being the selected medium.andM;The 802.6 standard is expected to describe a metropolitan area networkrunning at between 1 to 10 megabits/sec within a diameter of 50 kilometers.andO;The 802.9 standard will be a local area network interface standard forintegrated voice and data.andM;&quot;So the kind of thing you want to do is very important,&quot; Basi said, addingthat the competing standards also raise the question of who in organizationmakes decisions regarding communications.andP;  &quot;Who's going to run yourcommunications strategy?andP;  Will it be the data people or thetelecommunications people?&quot;andM;The National Institute for Standards and Technology, meanwhile, expects toincorporate FDDI in the Government Open Systems Interconnection Profile(GOSIP) Version 3.andP;  GOSIP Specifications for interoperable datacommunications are based on the seven-layer Open Systems Interconnectionreference model and GOSIP Version 1 was released as a Federal InformationProcessing Standard last August.andM;NIST's Kevin Mills, chief of the Systems and Network Architecture Division,noted that while FDDI chip sets already are available, the 802.6 and 802.9standards and their associated products still are due sometime in the future.andM;&quot;If you have an application for FDDI and the products are available, I wouldgo ahead and use themM&quot; Mills said.andP;  &quot;I don't know enough about 802.6 or802.9 to tell you what their capabilities will be or if they will be inconflict with FDDI or not, but I suspect that they may be more in conflictwith FDDI 2, which is meant to provide circuit service on top of the ring.&quot;andM;Point-to-point fiber connections to link local area networks have been aroundfor some time, Mills said.andP;  &quot;So in a sense the ring gives you an addedfeature because you can connect more LANs without having to run a whole bunchof fiber,&quot; he said.andM;FDDI, Mills said, has some specific capabilities and applications for whichit can be targeted immediately, such as interconnecting other LANs in ametropolitan area network with FDDI as a backbone network, or as a high-speednetwork for image transfer between host and workstations, or as a backendnetwork for host-to-disk transfers.andM;Basi said fiber is a good medium for servers, workstations and hosts.andP;  &quot;FDDIJis for computer-intensive environments with massive data flow,&quot; he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
