(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A couple has sued a maker and retailer ofthe diet supplement L-tryptophan, saying it gave the wife a rareand painful blood disorder that required hospitalization and lefther unable to work.   Federal officials suspect that contaminants in some batches ofthe over-the-counter supplement caused the disorder in 1,000Americans last year and have blamed the ailment for at least onedeath. L-tryptophan, an enzyme, is sold as a natural sleeping aid.   The lawsuit, filed Thursday by Louise and Donald Pangle, allegesthat she suffered rashes starting in September and later developedmuscle aches, nausea, weakness and other pain.   Mrs. Pangle, 39, was hospitalized twice in November and has yetto return to her job, said the Pangles' attorney, Joe Leman.   The lawsuit Catoosa County Superior Court names Price RinggoldDrugs of Ringgold and Nature's Bounty Inc. and Hudson Corp., bothof Bohemia, N.Y., as defendants, he said.   It says the companies were negligent in the making, testing andsale of the product and failed to warn the public about possibledangers of taking the supplement, he said.   The attorney said papers had yet to be served on the defendants,and no hearing date has been set.   Telephone calls Friday to Nature's Bounty went unanswered.   Outbreaks of the disorder, eosinophillia-myalgia syndrome, firstappeared last year in New Mexico, afflicting more than 1,000Americans.   The Atlanta-based federal Centers for Disease Control says thesyndrome has caused at least one death and may be responsible foras many as six.   The disorder causes excessive levels of white blood cells.   Researchers say people have used the substance for years withoutreported problems. It was commonly sold in health food stores undera variety of brand names until the outbreak, when most retailershonored a recall request from the federal Food and DrugAdministration and removed it from the shelves.   Scientists at the CDC and the FDA are trying to determine if thedisorder is caused by the product itself or by contaminants thatmay have gotten into certain batches of it.</TEXT></DOC>
