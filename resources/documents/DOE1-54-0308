The main conclusion is that there is no basis on whichto raise prices in the ESI at the current time. The decision to raiseprices is based on two erroneous premises in that prices should be setat a level to achieve a normal return on the replacement cost value ofassets employed; and that prices should be set at a level which encouragesadequate investment in new capacity. Prices should reflect short notlong run marginal costs.</TEXT></DOC>
