This hasbeen generally attributed to (1) the exponential growth in the use offossil fuel resulting in the release of fossil carbon as CO{sub 2} and(2) the deforestation or the leveling of forests around the earth whichreduced the photosynthetic utilization of atmospheric CO{sub 2}. Studieshave been conducted for the Carbon Dioxide Research Division (CDRD) ofthe US Department of Energy relating to possible mitigation technologieswhich would tend to reduce CO{sub 2} emissions in the future. 6 refs.,4 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
