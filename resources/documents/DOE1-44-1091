Initial velocity, product, and dead-end inhibitionstudies have been performed at pH 7.5 and support a ping-pong kineticmechanism. In the absence of hydrogen peroxide, both transhydrogenationbetween NADH and thioNAD, and isotope exchange between [{sup 14}C]NADHand NAD, have been demonstrated, although in both these experiments,the maximal velocity of nucleotide exchange was less than 1.5% the maximalvelocity of the peroxidatic reaction. We propose that NADH binds tightlyto both oxidized and two-electron reduced enzyme. NADH oxidation proceedsstereospecifically with the transfer of the 4S hydrogen to enzyme, andthen, via exchange, to water. No primary tritium kinetic isotope effectwas observed, and no statistically significant primary deuterium kineticisotope effects on V/K were determined, although primary deuterium kineticisotope effects on V were observed in the presence and absence of sodiumacetate. NADH peroxidase thus shares with other flavoprotein reductasesstriking kinetic, spectroscopic, and stereochemical similarities. Onthis basis, we propose a chemical mechanism for the peroxide cleavingreaction catalyzed by NADH peroxidase which involves the obligate formationof a flavinperoxide, and peroxo bond cleavage by nucleophilic attackby enzymatic dithiols.</TEXT></DOC>
