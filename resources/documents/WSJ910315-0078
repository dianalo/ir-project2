The Baltimore-based biotechnology company announced thatit had received an exclusive license from Johns HopkinsUniversity to exploit the line of human brain cells that theuniversity's scientists successfully cultivated in the testtube a year ago.</LP><TEXT>   One of Nova's first goals will be to see whethergenetically engineered versions of the nerve cells can betransplanted to the brains of Parkinson's disease patients torelieve the tremors and other symptoms of that nervedisorder, said Solomon Snyder. Dr. Snyder, a neuroscientist,is a founder and chief scientific adviser of Nova as well asthe head of the Johns Hopkins team that developed thetest-tube-grown brain cells.   Nova also hopes to genetically engineer the nerve cellsfor possible transplant to the brains of patients withAlzheimer's disease, Dr. Snyder said. The cell line also canbe used to screen chemicals for possible beneficial effectson brain and other nerve cells, he said.   The development of the first human brain cells to becontinuously cultured in the test tube was reported last Mayby Dr. Snyder and four colleagues: Gabrielle Ronnett, LyndaHester, Jeffrey Nye and Karen Connors. Brain and other nervecells don't ordinarily reproduce in the human body afterbirth, much less in the test tube. The Johns Hopkinsscientists obtained samples of brain cells, taken duringsurgery, from a young girl with a slightly enlarged brain andinduced the cells to begin dividing in the test tube.   Patents on the cell line, granted to the scientists, wereassigned to Johns Hopkins, which then offered to grantlicenses for use of the brain cells. Dr. Snyder said that &quot;toprevent any conflict of interest, I have a kind ofarms-length arrangement&quot; with the university and Nova on allinventions growing out of his university research. Once theinvention is turned over to the university, &quot;I don'tparticipate in any negotiations&quot; regarding use of theinvention, he said. Thus, he said, he wasn't involved inNova's obtaining a license for the brain cells.   Preliminary success already has been achieved ingenetically engineering the cells for the treatment ofParkinson's disease, Dr. Snyder said. Parkinson's diseaseinvolves a deficiency, in the brain, of dopamine, a chemicalthat transmits nerve impulses. Recently, researchers inSweden have reported that transplanting human fetal braincells to the brains of Parkinson's disease patientsdrastically reduced the amount of the drug, L-dopa, needed todamp the patients' tremors.   The Swedish experiments suggest that transplants of thetest-tube-cultured brain cells could be used to treat thedisease, Dr. Snyder explained. The test-tube cells would bemuch easier to obtain and use than fetal tissues, and theywouldn't be subject to the social objections that surroundthe use of fetal tissues.   Already, a human gene has been inserted into the cellsthat causes them to produce an enzyme-tyrosine hydroxylase --that the brain uses to make dopa. Other enzymes in the brainthen convert the dopa to dopamine. The genetically alteredcells have been tested successfully in rats, Dr. Snyder said.   The gene was inserted into the brain cells by the JohnsHopkins scientists and Edward Ginns at the National Institutefor Mental Health using one of the simplest of gene-insertiontechniques, the scientist explained. A more difficult andsophisticated technique of gene insertion will have to beused to prepare the cells for use in humans, Dr. Snyderadded.   It probably will take a couple of years to perfect thegenetically altered cells and test them on rats and thenmonkeys, the scientist estimated. How soon tests of the cellsin humans could begin then would depend on the Food and DrugAdministration, he said. He said he was assuming that theproposed treatment wouldn't be considered gene therapy, andthus wouldn't be subject to the approval of the NationalInstitutes of Health committees that rule on human geneticexperiments.   A similar approach to Alzheimer's disease involvesinserting a human gene for a different enzyme into thelaboratory brain cells and then transplanting them to thebrains of patients. The procedure is likely to be moredifficult, however, because the transplanted cells must makeconnections to other brain cells, rather than just produce achemical that diffuses through the brain as in Parkinson'sdisease. Nevertheless, &quot;we'll probably move on to Alzheimer'sdisease pretty soon,&quot; Dr. Snyder said.</TEXT></DOC>
