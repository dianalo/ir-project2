Mrs. Aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks,including her most outspoken critic, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile.   Manila has been rocked by almost daily explosions. Although noone has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the government hasblamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppledMrs. Aquino in coup attempts.   The Communist rebels have been waging a 21-year rebellion toestablish a Marxist state. The last cease-fire with them collapsedin early 1987.   Sen. Wigberto Tanada called for a truce between the governmentand the Communist rebels after a major earthquake in thePhilippines on July 16, but Mrs. Aquino rejected the proposal.   On Tuesday, a pro-Aquino senator, Orlando Mercado, urged Mrs.Aquino to put aside differences with her political foes and beginto discuss the nation's security problems and economic woes.   Enrile said he was willing to reconcile with Mrs. Aquino, whofired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coupattempt in November 1986.   Mrs. Aquino said in a statement today that Mercado and Enrileare welcome to join discussions now being held by a committee ofCabinet members.   Defense Secretary Fidel Ramos has adamantly refused anycease-fire with the Communist guerrillas since November 1986 whenthe Aquino government negotiated with the rebels during a 60-daytruce.   Ramos, a member of the Cabinet committee, has been credited withcrushing six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino.   Communists have accused him of whipping up threats of anothercoup attempt against Mrs. Aquino so that the civilian leadershipwould become indebted to him. Ramos has denied all allegations.   The last cease-fire with the rebels collapsed in January 1987after troops fired on farmers demonstrating outside Mrs. Aquino'soffice for land reform.</TEXT></DOC>
