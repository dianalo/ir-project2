it couldoccur in the present case or as the decision is appealed.andP;  The present casewill not be concluded for several weeks; damage awards must be set and addedto the initial rulings which cover the concepts of the case.andP;  The technicalnature of the intervention would most likely be in the form of an amicuscuriae memorandum.andP;  IBM's arguments to Justice put forth more than one reasonfor intervention.andP;  Because the decree on which Judge O'Neill based hisdecision does not specifically mention microcode, IBM asserts that the courttook excessive liberties in interpreting the consent decree.andM;VegetableandM;The decree is a contract, not a law, and therefore not subject tointerpretation.andP;  However, in his ruling the judge did not really think itimportant whether microcode was hardware (mentioned in the 1956 decree) orsoftware (which was not included in the decree).andP;  The judge focussed on theeffect of IBM's policies on an outsider's ability to reconfigure machinery.andO;Whether microcode is hardware, software or vegetable, it is an intrinsic partof a mainframe.andP;  For all practical purposes, IBM makes it part of thehardware by keeping mainframe microinstruction architecture secret.andP;  Theworst possible outcome for IBM might not be a refusal of Justice to acceptIBM's assertion that microcode is software, but rather an attempt by Justiceto put the microcode into the competitive arena.andP;  Justice could ask IBM topublish the internal specifications of its machines so that others might beable to write alternative microcode.andP;  This would raise the possibility thatIBM might be compelled to maintain mainframes that had non-standard microcode- and make IBM rue the day it first said microcode wasn't part of hardware.andO;Another argument against the court's finding is based on a seminal casecalled Tempo Music.andP;  That case involved the owner of a jukebox who refused topay royalties on all the tunes his customers played.andP;  ASCAP owned rights tosome of the tunes but wanted royalties on every play, ASCAP tune or not.andO;Tempo said it would pay royalties only if ASCAP could accurately say whichsongs were under its control.andP;  Because ASCAP would not provide Tempo with theinformation needed to compute the correct royalty payment, a court held thatTempo owed ASCAP nothing - from an economic standpoint, ASCAP had forcedTempo to act as it did.andP;  The connection between this case and the rulingagainst IBM's assertion of damages comes from IBM's pricing for microcode.andO;By charging a huge sum for the microcode, IBM's adversaries assert, themanufacturer has compelled (in economic terms) those that wish to split bigmainframes into small ones to violate IBM's copyright.andP;  IBM believes that itoffers an alternative that moots the Tempo argument: if a refurbisher turns avery small and old (and therefore inexpensive) mainframe plus a big one intotwo medium-sized ones, IBM's charges for microcode are low.andP;  The 1956 consentdecree isn't static.andP;  -andM;By Hesh WienerandM;It has been modified and modernised over time by agreements between IBM andthe Justice Department, most recently in 1970.andP;  But it remains an annoyanceto the manufacturer, and six years ago IBM tried to get Justice to scuttleit.andP;  At the time, the Reagan Administration's Justice Department was tryingto clear out old settlements that were creating work for the government butwhich had no practical benefit to the public.andP;  So IBM's effort did not comefrom out of the blue, so to speak.andP;  Alerted to IBM's mission, CDLA sent anemissary to Justice and helped persuade the government that the 1956 consentdecree was best left intact.andP;  Not coincidentally, the very same outsideattorney who helped CDLA in the mid-1980s prepared the amicus curiae brieffiled by CDLA in the AMI case: Lawrence W Boes of Fulbright Jaworski andamp; ReavisMcGrath.andP;  These adversarial actions were mild compared with those that maysoon occur.andP;  A number of leasing industry executives feel that their firmscould be forced to leave the IBM market because the manufacturer is bent oncontrolling its equipment from cradle to grave.andP;  They believe that thiscontrol is not only inimical to their secular interests but also a danger tothe customer base that is wedded to IBM.andP;  Trapped by huge investments insoftware and know-how, say many lessors, American companies would be subjectto enormous pressure from an unfettered IBM.andP;  On January 8, CDLA's electedchairman Joe Kelly, its professional president Ken Bouldin and attorneys fromWeil Gotshal went to the Justice Department.andP;  They want Justice to take along, hard look at IBM and, if it sees what CDLA sees, to tell IBM toconstrain its anticompetitive activities and withdraw to within theboundaries set out by the 1956 consent decree.andP;  Later that week, CDLA held aboard meeting in Denver at which it reviewed its situation vis-a-vis IBM.andO;There, a group of CDLA members created a trust called the Computer LeasingIndustry Contingency Fund, ruled by a board of five or six trustees.andP;  Thecompany at the heart of this process is Comdisco Inc, the largest and mostrespected independent lessor...andP;  but, because of its size and diversity, notthe lessor most vulnerable to IBM.andM;Contingency FundandM;Lessors were asked to kick in $100,000 apiece.andP;  Some have pledged thatamount, others have agreed to pay half that sum or less.andP;  Because the donorsnames and the sizes of their contributions have been kept secret, it is stillimpossible fully to characterise the trust's composition and financial power.andO;However, sources close to the matter reckon that $1m to $2m will soon beamassed.andP;  By comparison, CDLA's budget for 1990 was about $1.4m, and theincrease in the organisation's legal expenses is now projected to increasethat total by about 10% during 1991.andP;  For the moment, all CDLA's legalactivities will be funded out of the organisation's budget.andP;  The ContingencyFund will be tapped, if necessary, to supplement CDLA's regular funds.andO;CDLA's lawyers will survey the antitrust terrain, gather information topinpoint transgressions by IBM and develop a realistic assessment of theoptions available to the organisation and its constituent members.andP;  With manyCDLA members still ignorant of their trade group's activities and others yetunsure exactly where they stand, the coming months could prove stormy.andP;  CDLAis likely to be split into hawkish and dovish factions - but in the end willarrive at an uneasy consensus.andP;  Along the way, other events, such as thelawsuit filed by IBM Credit Corp against Comdisco on January 24, couldcomplicate matters, particularly for the smaller firms that have all they cando to run their businesses without going to war.(C) 1991 Technology News ofAmerica</TEXT></DOC>
