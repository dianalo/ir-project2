The worsening economic outlook was reflected on New York'sCommodity Exchange, where gold futures plunged $6.50 to $7.40 withthe contract for delivery in August settling at $367 a troy ounce.Silver was 8 cents to 8.7 cents lower with September at $5.183 atroy ounce.   Analyst Bette Raptopoulos of Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.said the sharp drop in gold prices was due to ``the convergence ofa number of moderately bearish factors,'' chief among them thefirming of the dollar Friday against other other major currencies.   A stronger dollar discourages foreign purchases of U.S. goods,which could reduce the incentive for the Federal Reserve Board toease up on interest rates. The Fed has recently been allowinginterest rates to fall in a bid to encourage borrowing and steerthe economy away from a recession.   But economic data released this week have shown the economyslowing, which has added to the pessimism in the gold market anddiscouraged investment buying of gold as an inflation hedge.   Some analysts found little cause for alarm in gold's decline,noting that the market has held up well in recent weeks despite thedarkening economic scenario.   ``I don't find today's sell-off to be terribly depressing ornegative,'' said Sharon Ziemian of Citibank in New York. ``I thinkit's quite reasonable.''   Crude oil futures prices continued a week-long slide on the NewYork Mercantile Exchange that analysts have attributed to growingsupplies and slackening demand.   West Texas Intermediate crude oil for September delivery fellbelow $18 a barrel for the first time since late February and someobservers predicted further losses next week.   Crude settled 14 cents to 19 cents lower with September at$17.93 a barrel; heating oil was .55 cent to 1.03 cents lower withAugust at 48.23 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .54 centlower to .97 cent higher with August at 52.95 cents a gallon.   Soybeans for near-term delivery plunged below $6.50 a bushel forthe first time in 16 months on the Chicago Board of Trade amidexpectations of continued improvement in Midwestern growingconditions.   Other grain futures also closed lower, largely in sympathy withthe plummeting soybean market. Wheat's losses were limited byrumors of new export business. The Agriculture Department announcedafter the close that it had targeted Algeria for sales of 1 millionmetric tons of wheat at subsidized prices.   Soybeans settled 1{ cents to 19 cents lower with August at $6.49a bushel; wheat was 2 cents lower to 1 cent higher with Septemberat $3.87} a bushel; corn was 2 cents to 3} cents lower withSeptember at $2.29 a bushel; oats were 6 cents to 8 cents lowerwith September at $1.36 a bushel.   Coffee futures fell to a new 13-year low on on New York'sCoffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange amid aggressive selling bycoffee-producing countries in an escalating battle for marketshare. The price drop follows the International CoffeeOrganization's July 3 suspension of coffee export quotas.   Coffee settled 1.20 cents to 2.25 cents lower with September at82.02 cents a pound.   Cattle futures settled mostly lower on the Chicago MercantileExchange in cautious trading ahead of the USDA's semi-annual cattleinventory report. The report, released after the close, confirmedperceptions of a modest expansion of the U.S. cattle herd and wasconsidered neutral for futures prices.   Live cattle were .18 cent lower to .05 cent higher with Augustat 72.57 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .40 centlower with August at 83.07 cents a pound; live hogs were .27 centlower to .10 cent higher with August at 46.05 cents a pound; frozenpork bellies were 1.22 cents lower to .25 cent higher with Augustat 25.70 cents a pound.</TEXT></DOC>
