Bill Clinton did it the otherway around.   The Arkansas governor built his campaign around nextTuesday's critical primary here and then, as deputy campaignmanager George Stephanopoulos puts it, &quot;worked backwards.&quot; Hestocked his national campaign with political professionalswith Illinois ties. He visited the state, bounced satellitefeeds into it and courted party grandees. And now that he hasbuilt up a big delegate margin against former Sen. PaulTsongas of Massachusetts, he's positioned to make hisbreakthrough in the fight for the nomination.</LP><TEXT>   In an interview, Mr. Clinton says he always believed that&quot;this thing would probably come down to Illinois and whathappens in the industrial heartland after Super Tuesday.&quot; Hewas right. In the twin Midwestern primaries here and inMichigan -- regional fights without regional favorite sons,the biggest tests of the campaign thus far -- Mr. Tsongas maybe facing his last real chance to stop Mr. Clinton.   Long a pivotal state, Illinois has catapulted three of thelast four Democratic nominees to convention victories. And ifMr. Clinton's gamble pays off and he wins here, he'lldemonstrate for the first time that he can win not only in aNorthern state but one that will also be a battleground inthe fall campaign.   But even with his head start here, Mr. Clinton facesformidable challenges picking his way through the wardpolitics, taboos and customs of perhaps the most Byzantinepolitical culture in the nation. And the doubts that he facesnationwide over his marriage and reports that he angled toevade the draft in the Vietnam years are magnified in thehothouse of Illinois politics.   While Mr. Tsongas now publicly is assailing his rival as&quot;our most vulnerable candidate,&quot; Chicago political insidersprivately worry that Mr. Clinton -- with whom they have nolong-term relationship anyhow -- has no net to catch him ifhe starts tumbling.   &quot;People just aren't comfortable with Clinton,&quot; says stateSen. Jerry Joyce, whose district is in the southwest cornerof Chicago. &quot;There's something there that bothers them.&quot;   Mike Sheehan, the Cook County sheriff who had sided withNebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey before he dropped out, is holdingback from Mr. Clinton. &quot;I want to stay out of this,&quot; hepleads. &quot;I don't think Clinton's going to be in it in thelong haul.&quot;   There are other warning signs: The coalition of 14 unionsthat had endorsed Tom Harkin has decided not to side withanyone now that the Iowa senator has withdrawn from the race;it's the first time in a generation that Illinois labordidn't have a clear favorite in a Democratic presidentialprimary. &quot;There isn't anyone articulating labor's position,&quot;says Sue Altman, spokeswoman for the Illinois chapter of theAFL-CIO.   Chicago Mayor Richard Daley has also chosen no favorite,and the remainder of the Cook County machine has neitherendorsed a candidate nor even planned a function for theprimary.   But Mr. Tsongas may not be in a position to reap thebenefit of these opportunities. The Tsongas camp has the airof a militia fighting a bigger, better equipped and richerfoe. Mr. Clinton has raised an estimated $400,000 in thisstate alone; as recently as six weeks ago, Mr. Tsongas hadonly two workers in Illinois.   Mr. Tsongas may have erred when he ignored the advice ofleading Democrats here. They urged him to skip campaigning inthe Southern states, all of which he lost by big marginsanyhow, and to hopscotch ahead to Illinois, where he couldhave stolen a march on Mr. Clinton in the senior-citizencenters, ethnic enclaves and church-basement bingo socials.   Mr. Tsongas has also failed to make any inroads amongblack voters here, despite a visit this week to Harper HighSchool on Chicago's South Side. As a result, Mr. Clinton,having won four-fifths of the black vote in the SouthernSuper Tuesday primaries this week, begins with a base ofblack and Hispanic voters that can provide as much as an 18%head start. &quot;Tsongas hasn't said anything about the problemsthat African-Americans care about, and at least Clinton istrying,&quot; says Robert Starks, an expert on black politics atNortheastern Illinois University's Center for Inner CityStudies.   Moreover, in a situation where there's little interest anda voter turnout that a leading Democratic analyst believeswill be &quot;pathetic,&quot; the candidate with the momentum may bethe candidate with the advantage.   Though parts of it are unenthusiastic, Mr. Clinton'sorganization, assembled by former Daley campaign managerDavid Wilhelm, is hanging together. It's no match for theorganization that former Vice President Walter Mondalefashioned eight years ago, but it's far stronger than whatMr. Tsongas's supporters have pasted together in the pastweek or so.   And so as the Clinton forces deploy their shock troops --they have Advance Team Red, Advance Team White and AdvanceTeam Blue strewn across the state in the final days beforethe primary -- the Tsongas forces are struggling along. TheTsongas campaign plane got stuck in the mud at Midway Airportthis week, and inevitably the local television stations tookthe episode as a metaphor for the campaign's troubles.   &quot;A few weeks ago no one knew who Paul Tsongas was,&quot; saysKitty Kurth, the Tsongas state director. &quot;It's better now.And the people who know us like us. The question is whetherwe can reach the rest of the people in less than a week.&quot;   In recent days, the two candidates have continued to spar.Mr. Clinton's forces here are distributing a leaflethighlighting Mr. Tsongas's opposition to legislation banningstriker replacements, an important issue for union members.Mr. Tsongas's camp is seizing on a dozen-year-old appeal Mr.Clinton made to Korean industrialists boasting thatArkansas's status as a right-to-work state was one of its&quot;many benefits,&quot; and crowing: &quot;Arkansas ranks among the fivelowest states in the nation on average hourly earnings ofmanufacturing workers.&quot;   There remains a certain whiff of unpredictability in theatmosphere here. For one thing, there's the presence of JerryBrown on the ballot; the former California governor hastargeted college and high-school audiences, parades anddebates, events that will permit him to gain attentionwithout spending money.   There's also the fact that the political professionals Mr.Clinton has enlisted aren't the guarantee of success theymight have been a decade or more ago. &quot;People get theirpolitical news from television rather than from precinctcommittees now,&quot; says Sam Gove, a veteran political analystat the University of Illinois's Institute of Government andPublic Affairs. &quot;The organization doesn't have the jobs togive out anymore. The ward committeemen can't deliver thevotes anymore.&quot;   So Mr. Tsongas is probing the softness of the Clintonsupport. On Wednesday afternoon, for example, Thaleia TsongasSchlesinger, Mr. Tsongas's twin sister, burst intoheadquarters to report that all day she'd been going to&quot;places where the top of the crowd is for Clinton and whereeveryone in the rest of the crowd wanted a Tsongas button.&quot;   And Mr. Clinton is facing urban ethnic voters for thefirst time, a target that's no mystery to Mr. Tsongas. He hastargeted 14 Greek groups and even three Assyrian groups, andseems comfortable in an electorate where whole blocks speakonly Polish and where the Irish and Italians have their ownpower centers.   That's Mr. Clinton's biggest test. &quot;He has now proven hehas two key elements of the Democratic coalition: blacks andSouthern whites,&quot; says Paul Maslin, a Democratic politicalpollster. &quot;If he can add the blue-collar ethnics in placeslike Illinois, he's the nominee.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
