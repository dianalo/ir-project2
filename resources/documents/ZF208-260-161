(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Just How Real Is Your Pay Hike?andM;DATAMATION'S latest salary survey (&quot;What Are You Worth?&quot;andP;  Oct. 1, 1989, p.andO;22) had some good and some bad news for information systems professionals.andO;The good news: the expected average annual salary increase for an IS employeein 1989 came in at 5.6%.andP;  The bad news: this year's pay hike is a fullpercentage point below last year's 6.6% bump in pay.andM;As if that bit of news weren't bad enough, some economic data are rubbingsalt into the wound.andP;  Inflation at the consumer level, as measured by theConsumer Price Index (CPI), is expected to jump 5% in 1989--a percentagepoint above inflation's pace in 1988.andP;  In other words, the gap between theincreases that IS workers see in their paychecks and those that theyexperience when paying for food, health care, housing and other components ofthe index has narrowed from 2.6% last year to a mere 0.6% this year.andM;Not everybody, of course, has only pocket change to show for their IS labors.andO;Some professionals have bulging billfolds filled with the extra dollarsthey're being paid because of their specialized skills.andM;Security directors are making nearly 37% more today than they were a yearago.andP;  Database managers have 26% higher salaries this year.andP;  Connectivityanalysts receive 27% more for their connections in 1989.andM;Comparing your wages with such glamorous, high-paying jobs won't necessarilygive you a sense of what your own salary hike is really worth in today'smarket.andP;  The best way to do that is to measure the increase in your paycheckagainst the increase in the cost of living in your geographic region.andM;The Northeast region of the United States experienced the highest rate ofinflation in the country--5.8%--between June 1988 and June 1989, according tothe Bureau of Labor Statistics.andP;  Metropolitan areas within the region withpopulations in the 50,000 to 500,000 range had to deal with price risesaveraging 6.5%.andP;  In the other regions of the country -- North Central, Southand West -- inflation in the 12-month period ran below the average of 5.2%for U.S.andP;  city dwellers.andP;  So, while pay raises may be less in the heartlandof America, increases in the cost of living tend to be less steep, too.andM;Beyond making you feel good or miserable about your current pay situation,geographic analysis is also handy if you are considering where to locate foryour first job or are being tempted by a substantial pay hike to relocate.andO;Being familiar with cost differences is one way to be sure that the extraincome is going to improve your standard of living and not just keep you atthe status quo.andM;Living costs for middle managers in Boston, for example, last year were 64%higher than those for the average U.S.andP;  urban area, according to the AmericanChamber of Commerce Researchers Association (ACCRA).andP;  Living costs in SanFrancisco measured almost 45% above the composite national index.andP;  But if NewOrleans or Memphis is going to be your new home, expect living costs belowthe national average.andM;What is the latest outlook for inflation?andP;  Right now, Cahners Economics isbetting that the Federal Reserve Board's monetary policy will put the lid onany inflationary spiral.andP;  Our forecast calls for moderate increases in theCPI of 4% in 1990 and 1991.andP;  So, if inflation stays in check, your next payraise may contain some real money.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
