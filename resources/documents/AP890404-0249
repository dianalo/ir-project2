Meanwhile, gold prices were narrowly mixed. Republic NationalBank of New York reported a bid of $385.90 for a troy ounce of goldas of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $385.80 late Monday.   The dollar fell largely because of central bank intervention,which has squelched the currency's upward move for the time being,said Dan Holland, a vice president at Discount Corp.   The central banks, in response to requests from the bigindustrial countries, sold dollars over several sessions last weekand again Monday and Tuesday to bring the dollar down.   European dealers said the dollar fell Tuesday in response tocomments by French Economic Minister Pierre Beregovoy concerningthe Group of Seven's agreement that the dollar should not rise orexcessively decline.   Officials from the seven countries _ the United States, Britain,France, West Germany, Japan, Italy and Canada _ discussed theforeign exchange markets during a meeting last weekend inWashington.   Traders in the United States were also following foreigninterest rate movements closely. Overseas interest rate hikes arebearish for the dollar because they make other currencies moreattractive.   Holland said the dollar might stabilize if Japan and WestGermany do not raise their interest rates.
