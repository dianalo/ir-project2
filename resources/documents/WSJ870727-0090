Myers</HL><DD> 07/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ECONOMIC NEWS (ECO) </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   America's long-lived but slow-growth economic expansion now seems likely, at long last, to produce some respectable profit gains.    Like a lower unemployment rate, profit gains have been strangely elusive. This newspaper's quarterly survey showed that in the 1987 first period, major corporations posted their first double-digit increase -- 13% -- in year-to-year profit comparisons since the second quarter of 1984, when the economy was rebounding from the 1981-82 recession. In all 1985 and most of 1986, earnings trailed year-earlier levels.    But now, most forecasters see a change in the making. As the chart below shows, the 51 economists surveyed monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a Sedona, Ariz., newsletter, have been raising their average forecast of 1987 pre-tax profits. They now see an 11.6% increase. However, they have been paring their 1988 forecast, partly because strong profits this year make it harder to chalk up a big gain next year.    Given the volatility of corporate profits, it isn't surprising that behind the Blue Chip averages lies considerable disagreement. In the July 10 survey, the 10 most optimistic forecasts envision an 18.1% profit gain this year, on the average, while the bottom 10 expect only a 3.9% rise. Next year's forecasts range from a 15.7% gain for the top 10 to an 0.8% drop for the bottom 10.    &quot;Earnings are booming,&quot; comments John D. Connolly, a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds, in a research report. &quot;A combination of lower reported tax rates, operating leverage and price increases will lead to around a 20% earnings-per-share gain for the average company. Overhead has been slashed, and variable costs, particularly labor, have been restrained.&quot;    Company after company has attributed its profit gains to corporate restructuring, but the exact effects of such moves aren't readily measurable. &quot;For one thing, any number of other fundamental influences can affect a firm's profits,&quot; notes Anna Merjos, a vice president at Merrill Lynch. &quot;In addition, the effects of such efforts as significant cost-cutting or the redeployment of assets from one area of a firm's business to another -- or to an entirely new business -- are usually felt over a period of time.&quot;    Although some banks are reporting staggering losses due to huge additions to foreign-debt reserves -- losses that may artificially depress total corporate earnings for the second quarter -- the profit outlook at manufacturing companies is bright.    &quot;Because of the devaluation of the dollar,&quot; says David D. Hale, the chief economist at Kemper Financial Services, &quot;a growing number of U.S. firms are now expanding their profit margins and reversing the income shifts between producers and consumers which occurred during the first half of the decade, when the dollar rose sharply and depressed the country's tradeable-goods manufacturing industries.&quot;    Another Merrill Lynch report observes, &quot;Profits will outperform the economy in 1987. Overall operating profits are likely to rise about 12% -- and even more for nonfinancial corporations -- their best showing since the boom year of 1984. Yet real GNP will rise just slightly faster than 2% -- its worst performance since the recession year of 1982.&quot;    In fact, one anomaly of the current expansion is the fact that the Blue Chip group is reducing its forecast of inflation-adjusted gross national product for this year while raising its profit prediction. Another anomaly: Many securities analysts are lifting their estimates of companies' earnings.    According to a spokesman at the I/B/ E/S data center of Lynch, Jones andamp; Ryan, a New York brokerage firm, &quot;there has been a trend in the 1980s for analysts to revise estimates downward.&quot; He notes that except for November 1980, decreases have predominated. Last January, for example, 34% more estimates for Standard andamp; Poor's 500 companies were cut than increased.    But in May, the situation reversed, with 25% more upward than downward revisions. June was an even split. This month, however, reductions led by 18%, largely because of lower forecasts for banks and financial-services concerns. Looking at 1988, Allen Sinai of Shearson Lehman Brothers expects profit growth to weaken because of &quot;the maturing business expansion, increasing pressure on capacity, higher costs from doing business, and no further major gains to earnings from a lower dollar.&quot;    And Merrill Lynch, attributing the higher profit margins largely to modest wage increases and noting the lack of productivity gains except in manufacturing, observes, &quot;Wage increases cannot be expected to trail price increases for an extended time. Margins are likely to narrow by next year.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
