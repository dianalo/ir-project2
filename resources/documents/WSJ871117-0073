Although Saudi Arabia appears to have temporarily shelved its market-linked pricing plan, price discounting is spreading in OPEC. And some non-OPEC producers are reducing their official sales prices.    Egypt announced yesterday that it is cutting oil prices $1 a barrel for the second half of November after raising them 20 cents a barrel for the first half of the month. This will put the price of Egypt's top grade, the Suez blend, at $15.90 a barrel.    Industry sources speculated that Mexico, another non-OPEC producer, soon will have to reduce its market-linked crude-oil prices. Among OPEC members, Venezuela recently reduced prices $1 a barrel on some heavier crude oils that aren't a part of its OPEC quota.    Elsewhere in OPEC, several countries are offering crude at discounts below official prices, according to industry reports. &quot;A lot of OPEC crude, mainly Iranian, is sloshing about the market at prices which are verging on distress levels,&quot; the Middle East Economic Survey reported. The Cyprus-based industry publication, with close ties to Middle East members of OPEC, placed the Iranian discounts at between $1.50 and $2 a barrel.    Industry sources cite excessively high production by Iran's war foe, Iraq, and by the United Arab Emirates as key factors in weakening the oil markets. (Iraq's output is estimated at 2.7 million barrels a day.) They also cite the U.S. embargo against Iranian oil. Petroleum Intelligence Weekly reported that Iran &quot;needs to find buyers for eight giant cargoes put on the water for western destinations around the time the U.S. embargo took effect.&quot;    Other industry sources said Japanese companies are balking at buying Iranian oil without substantial discounts. The companies are holding out an implied threat that Japan may join the U.S. embargo, the sources said.    Crude-oil prices on spot markets, meanwhile, have dropped sharply. For Brent, the North Sea bench mark crude, the price fell to $17.90 on spot markets yesterday from $18 Friday. The spot price for West Texas Intermediate, the U.S. bench mark crude, fell to $18.65 a barrel from $18.95 Friday.    For quality and transportation reasons, North Sea and West Texas crudes normally are priced $1 or more higher than Mideast OPEC crudes, which are based on an $18-a-barrel bench mark. &quot;Right now, these government sales prices are relatively high to spot crude and that is putting pressure on OPEC prices,&quot; said Hossein Tahmassebi, chief economist of Ashland Oil Inc.    Oil companies are apparently beginning to reduce their purchases of crude from Saudi Arabia, where production is estimated to have fallen below its OPEC quota of 4.3 million barrels a day for the first time in several months. The kingdom's key Arabian Light grade is officially priced at $17.52 a barrel.    Saudi Arabia refuses to discount its crude prices and has repeatedly denied previous reports in The Wall Street Journal that it planned to offer major purchasers future rebates under a market-linked pricing arrangement. Sources said, however, that while the proposal hasn't yet been submitted to King Fahd, it might be resurrected if the wave of discounting by others in OPEC continues.    ---   Industry Survey Released   HOUSTON -- Although oil prices have recovered some since last year's collapse, they aren't high enough -- and oil companies aren't spending enough -- to halt the slide in domestic petroleum production, according to an annual survey taken by Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.    The big accounting firm, which surveyed 270 oil companies, also reported yesterday that it expects U.S. energy demand to continue to outpace domestic supplies, leading to even greater dependence on imported oil. Survey results also showed that petroleum prices must exceed $30 a barrel (compared with current prices of between $18 to $20) to justify increased exploration sufficient to prevent a further rise in U.S. dependence on foreign oil. Also, Arthur Andersen estimated that oil companies would have to more than double spending from current levels to limit dependence on imports.    U.S. petroleum production has fallen to less than 8.3 million barrels a day from nine million barrels a day at the beginning of last year before the oil-price collapse. In the same period, petroleum imports climbed to more than six million barrels a day from some five million barrels a day, according to the survey.    &quot;The plain fact is that current exploration and development spending is far too low to prevent a further and significant slide in domestic production of oil,&quot; said David Moore, director of the survey and a partner in Arthur Andersen.    New oil discovered last year by the companies surveyed amounted to only 42 barrels for each 100 barrels produced. Finding costs also fell to about $8.50 a barrel from about $14.50 a barrel five years earlier. &quot;But there are limits in the quantities of reserves that can be found at this low finding-cost level,&quot; Mr. Moore said. </TEXT></DOC>
