That's bad news for many small investors who snapped upmortgage-backed bonds issued by thrifts in the 1980s to enjoythe unlikely combination of double-digit yields and triple-Acredit ratings.</LP><TEXT>   A lot of investors aren't even aware that they could behurt by a policy adopted in April by the Resolution TrustCorp., the government's thrift-bailout agency. Theseinvestors may not even know that the mortgage-backed bondsthey hold were issued by savings institutions, let alone thatthe thrifts are insolvent and the bonds are callable.   The RTC has the power to cancel, or &quot;repudiate,&quot; bonds andcall them early if a thrift is insolvent. So far, issues fromthree thrifts have been &quot;repudiated&quot; and more such moves areexpected, says an RTC spokesman.   The most recent repudiation -- $391 million of bondsissued by Merabank Federal Savings Bank of Phoenix, Ariz., --was made June 8 but hasn't been widely publicized. Bycontrast, $3.8 billion of bonds of Franklin SavingsAssociation in Kansas were repudiated the same day and got alot of attention.   About $8.3 billion of mortgage-backed bonds were issued bythrifts that now are insolvent. Of this amount, $4.5 billionin bonds, owned mostly by institutions, have been called. Therest are mostly in the hands of individuals, says FrancisParisi, who monitors the performance of mortgage securitiesfor Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.   Most investors won't lose their money, because thegovernment will redeem the bonds at face value, or par, plusaccrued interest. They will, however, lose the high yield andface the inconvenience of finding a new place to invest.   Investors can't just sell the bonds to some unwary soul.The RTC policy has already led some institutional owners ofthrift-issued bonds to sell their holdings, driving downprices in the $20 billion market for thrift-issuedmortgage-backed bonds.   But bond experts say it might still be worthwhile to dustoff the prospectus or call the broker that sold the bonds todetermine whether prompt action should be taken. About halfthe issues that individuals own contain features that enableinvestors to sell their bonds back to the trustee. Doing socould save them the risk of losing months' worth of interestif the bonds are called.   Here's what investors should look for:   -- First, if the original issuer of the mortgage-backedsecurity is a thrift, ask the broker if the issuing thrift isinsolvent, or could become so. &quot;They might be solvent today,but the next time they have to report on their tangible networth, they might not meet the asset requirements,&quot; says Mr.Parisi. Bonds of insolvent thrifts are more likely to becalled if their yields are substantially above the marketrate; many such bonds now have yields above 10%.   -- Check to see whether the bond was sold at a premium toits face value. If it was, investors will lose money if thebond is called, as the government will redeem only the facevalue. &quot;This might be another case when bondholders bite thebullet,&quot; says Byron Klapper, publisher of Fitch InvestorsService, a bond-rating concern in New York. In such cases, hesays, investors should just sit back and enjoy the yield aslong as it lasts.   -- See if your bond is a so-called collateralized letterof credit. This name typically applies to the type of bondheld by individuals that might get called by the RTC.Institutions typically own a different form ofmortgage-backed bonds, securities sold directly by thethrifts as a way of raising capital. And it was institutions,which dominate the mortgaged-backed market, that got stungwhen the the RTC began the bond-repudiation campaign bycalling $1.3 billion of the bonds of Centrust Bank, aFlorida-based thrift seized in March.   Next on the RTC's hit list are mostly the collateralizedletter-of-credit bonds held by the little guys. These areindustrial revenue bonds backed with top-quality collateral,such as Government National Mortgage Association securities.Collateralized LOCs are owned mostly by individuals, says Mr.Parisi, because they are regional issues sold by localunderwriters.   -- If the bond is a collateralized LOC, check to seewhether it has a &quot;put&quot; feature. About half have so-called putoptions that enable bondholders to take the bonds back to thetrustee and redeem them at face value plus accrued interest.Investors can find the name of the bond's trustee, which willbe a major bank, by checking the prospectus.   Some investors might want to approach the trustee nowbecause the government hasn't indicated yet whether it wouldpay holders of the LOCs interest up to the time the call isannounced, or only up to the date the thrift was taken over.&quot;Investors risk losing a few months' worth of interest, sothat would be the incentive to get out now -- particularly ifthe thrift has one foot in the grave,&quot; says Standard andamp; Poor'sMr. Parisi. This lack of certainty over the payment period ofpost-insolvency interest applies only to the collateralizedLOC bonds. The RTC recently issued a policy regardingmortgage-backed bonds, stating it would pay interest up tothe date of redemption.   Some bond specialists see other risks. Richard Lehmann,president of the Bond Investors Association in Miami Lakes,Fla., and publisher of the Defaulted Bond Newsletter,believes unscrupulous brokers may take advantage of investorignorance and continue to sell these bonds. &quot;Brokers mightbuy the bonds at a discount,&quot; he says, &quot;and sell them at apremium to investors who will face a loss of their principalinvestment if the bonds are called early.&quot;   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Bond prices finished modestly higher in response to a latesell-off in the stock market.   For much of the day, bonds barely budged. But the marketwas aroused late in the day when the Dow Jones IndustrialAverage plunged 44.55 points in the last half-hour of tradingand closed at 2,857.18. That was the lowest level for the Dowsince the Memorial Day weekend.   In the afternoon, &quot;There was a pop in bond prices afterthe stock market's quick free fall,&quot; said Mitchell Held,chief financial economist at Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co.   The benchmark 8 3/4% 30-year Treasury bond rose 1/8 point,or $1.25 for a bond with a $1,000 face amount. The bond wasquoted late at a price of 102 27/32, compared with 102 23/32Thursday. The benchmark bond's yield, which moves in theopposite direction from its price, eased to 8.47% from 8.49%Thursday. Shorter-term securities were little changed.   Tumbling stock prices dragged down junk-bond prices. Mostjunk bonds, the high-yield high-risk corporate securitiesthat have low credit ratings or no credit ratings at all,closed between 1/4 and 3/8 point lower.   Hard-hit were junk bonds from cyclical andrecession-sensitive companies, such as Quantum Chemical Corp.It was recently reported that securities analysts believecommodity-chemical and plastics companies, a group thatincludes Quantum, will see declines in second-quarterearnings ranging from 30% to 35%.   Quantum Chemical's 12 1/2% senior subordinated notes,maturing in 1999, ended down 1 point at 91 1/4.   In the Treasury market, bond prices fluctuated aimlesslybefore the stock market declined. Traders said the market'slifeless tone reflected confusion over two contradictoryeconomic reports that provided mixed signals about theeconomy's health.   The durable-goods report for May showed that factoryorders rose a stronger-than-expected 3.9%, a sign ofresurging economic strength. But a report on personal incomeand personal-consumption expenditures was weaker thanexpected. Personal income rose 0.3% in May andpersonal-consumption expenditures were flat, both suggestingthat the economy remains sluggish.</TEXT></DOC>
