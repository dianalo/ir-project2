In the area of geothermal technology development,studies were made on elemental techniques for various apparatus requiredin a demonstration plant for 10MW-class, binary-cycle geothermal powergeneration. Requirements for the location of a demonstration plant areexamined from various viewpoints. A downhole pump is developed. An investigationis made of cooled hot water reinjection and physiochemical mechanismsof hot water injection which are required for efficient production ofgeothermal water. Techniques for preventing the deposition of calciumcarbonate scales and those for removing hydrogen sulfide are also studied.NEDO is cooperating with U.S. counterparts under an IEA agreement incarrying out a hot dry rock development project at Fenton Hill. Fourmodel areas were selected and a nationwide geothermal exploration surveywas made using various survey techniques to clarify the conditions ofgeothermal energy over the nation. Studies including well surveys areperformed in the Sengan and Kurikoma areas to provide data required toestablish prospecting techniques for deep geothermal resources. Developmentof an effective method for terrestrial magnetism measurement is currentlyunder way. (65 figs, 15 tabs, 10 photos)</TEXT></DOC>
