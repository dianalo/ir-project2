The advertisements were taken out by a special war crimesinquiry panel set up after the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Centeraccused the British government of failing to seek and prosecute warcriminals.   ``It is alleged that some war criminals responsible forgenocide, murder or manslaughter in Germany or German-occupiedterritories during the Second World War are in the (UnitedKingdom),'' the ad says.   ``Others with British nationality may be living elsewhere in theworld. The names of some suspects have already been sent to theHome Office.''   The advertisements say that when the inquiry is complete, HomeMinister Douhlas Hurd will advise the government ``whether there issufficient evidence to justify the prosecution of the allegedoffenders.''   They ask anyone with ``any information that you think may berelevant'' to write the Home Office. The ads are to be repeated innewspapers Sunday.   The inquiry panel is headed by the former director of publicprosecutions, Sir Thomas Hetherington, and William Chambers, aformer senior government official in Scotland.   Hetherington and Chambers will spend a year investigatingevidence and interviewing people with information in Britain andabroad, including the Soviet Union.   Efrain Zuroff, director of the Wiesenthal Center's Israeloffice, last month gave British officials the names of two morealleged war criminals and more evidence against nine suspects thegovernment already confirmed are living in Britain.   Zuroff said at that time that the center expects dozens ofsuspected war criminals living in Britain and other Westerncountries to stand trial within 18 months as new legal changesclose in on the suspects.   He said in an interview in London last month that, before Hurdset up the inquiry, Britain was the only major Western country thatrefused to take any action against alleged war criminals.   The Los Angeles-based Wiesenthal center has submitted the namesof a total of 256 suspects to eight countries _ Australia, Brazil,Britain, Canada, Sweden, the United States, Venezuela and WestGermany _ where they are alleged to have fled after the war endedin 1945.   The suspects are mainly from the Ukraine, Latvia and Lithuania,all now part of the Soviet Union. They are accused of collaboratingwith Nazi invaders in killing Jews and others.   British-resident suspects include a former Lithuanian platooncommander, 71-year-old Antanas Gecas, who lives in Edinburgh,Scotland.   The Wiesenthal center alleges Gecas killed more Jews than KlausBarbie, the so-called Butcher of Lyon. Gecas, a retired miningengineer, says he is innocent and the accusations have wrecked hislife.   The Wiesenthal center tracked down the suspects, mostly over age70, after gaining access to international immigration data in late1986.   West Germany and the United States are probing cases identifiedby the center, while Australia and Canada set up inquirycommissions and changed their laws recently to allow prosecutions.   Zuroff charged last month that Brazil, Sweden and Venezuela havedone little or nothing to trace the individuals or prosecute.</TEXT></DOC>
