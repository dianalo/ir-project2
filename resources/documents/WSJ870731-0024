The timing of the actions fueled speculation among some Western diplomats that Norway might be &quot;showing solidarity with the West,&quot; as one put it, in light of recent disclosures that a state-owned Norwegian arms company, Kongsberg Vaapenfabrikk AS, illegally exported militarily sensitive equipment to the Soviets in 1982.    However, Norwegian officials denied that the actions were tied to the Kongsberg affair or were an attempt to placate the U.S. Congress, which is working toward sanctions against the Norwegian company.    The U.S. has said that the sale of equipment by Kongsberg and a subsidiary of Japan's Toshiba Corp. enabled a Leningrad shipyard to build an ultra-quiet submarine propeller that is difficult to track.    Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg said Norway informed the Soviet Union of the expulsions and bannings on July 15 but didn't publicize the actions, to avoid retaliation. On Monday, however, Moscow responded by barring a diplomat and a former translator from Norway's Soviet mission, both of whom are now in Norway. Moscow accused the Norwegians of activities incompatible with their diplomatic status.    In announcing Norway's actions, Mr. Stoltenberg criticized the Soviets sharply, both for the conduct of their representatives in Oslo and for the reciprocal banning of the two Norwegians. He said the four Soviets had been engaged in a variety of industrial intelligence-gathering for as long as three years, and he called the reasoning Moscow used to bar the two Norwegian diplomats &quot;unjustified accusations.&quot;    However, he also sought to soothe any bilateral strain the Norwegian actions might cause with Moscow by announcing that Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov will pay an official visit to Norway in January. He said the visit would &quot;continue a dialogue at the highest levels&quot; that was initiated last December when Norwegian Prime Minister Gro Harlem Brundtland visited in Moscow.    The Soviet diplomat who is being expelled from Norway is Valentin V. Korpusov, a second secretary who has been involved in commercial and trade affairs since he was posted to Oslo in May 1983.    The trade delegate who is still in Norway and has been ordered out is Valerij I. Resjetnikov, who arrived in September 1985. The two other trade delegates used to work in Oslo but have since left. </TEXT></DOC>
