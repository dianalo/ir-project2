The Seoul talks were called after the United States named SouthKorea as an unfair trader in telecommunications in February underthe 1988 Trade Act calling for tough retaliatory trade sanctions.   The meeting began Wednesday and continued until late Thursdaynight but there was little chances of agreement, said officials atthe Communications Ministry.   Gordana Earp, the chief U.S. delegate, asked South Korea toannounce a timetable to open its market before July 1 next year butSeoul officials refused to comply, saying their telecommunicationsindustry needs two or three more years to grow, the ministryofficial said.   South Korea expressed willingness to accept parts of Washington'sdemands to open its market to U.S. telecommunications equipment butrefused to allow direct U.S. investment in the market forvalue-added networks, the official said.   Earp strongly indicated that Washington may impose tradesanctions against South Korea unless its demand was fully accepted,he said.   The telecommunications talks were the first in a series ofintensive trade negotations scheduled in the coming months betweenthe two countries.   Seoul officials are concerned that Washington's trade pressurewill get tougher in the coming months when U.S. Vice President DanQuayle, Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher and Trade RepresentativeCarla Hills visit Seoul.   Mosbacher is scheduled to visit Seoul Sunday through Tuesday todiscuss wide-ranging trade issues, presumably with emphasis on SouthKorea's market-opening measures.   Mosbacher is expected to seek to further open South Korea'sagricultural market to U.S. beef and other farm products and demandSeoul's stricter protection of U.S. intellectual property rights,Korean officials said.   The two countries signed an agreement for protection ofintellectual property rights in 1985 but the United States hascomplained that South Korea neglected its strict enforcement.   Mosbacher is also expected to raise a plan by Du Pont Co. toconstruct a $150 million plant in South Korea.   South Korea, under Washington's pressure, opened its market to243 U.S. agricultural products in May but the United States says theaction was not enough, accoring to Seoul officials.   South Korea is Washington's second largest agricultural market inthe world after Japan. It imported $2.3 billion worth of U.S. farmproducts last year.   Washington ran a trade deficit of $8.5 billion with South Korealast year.</TEXT></DOC>
