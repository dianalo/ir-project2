Five people were reported killed and 15 wounded.   In an unprecedented report on the civil war in the north, theEthiopian News Agency reported Friday that the rebels launchedattack on the port of Assab at midnight Tuesday from a boat atnearby Senabor Island.   ``Bandits who are bent on creating havoc to lives and propertyfired shells at the town,'' the news agency reported.   ``A team from the Ethiopian navy immediately took action andblew up the boat in which the rebels had infiltrated the area. Theboat was reported to have capsized with the rebels in it,'' saidthe agency.   Western diplomats said it was believed to be the first rebelattack on the port 530 miles northeast of Addis Ababa, the capitalof the Marxist government. Assab and Massawa, Ethiopia's only otherport of significance, are both in Eritrea, where the secessionistEritrean People's Liberation Front has been fighting for 27 yearsin Africa's oldest civil war. The rebels also are Marxist.   The diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theybelieved Assab refinery was not damaged but were unsure about theport, which controls up to 80 percent of this East African nation'simports and exports, including emergency food for 7 million droughtvictims.   The official news agency did not say whether the port orrefinery were damaged. It also did not report how many rebels wereinvolved in the attack, nor did it indicate what type of weaponsthey used.   The agency also disclosed for the first time that rebels of theTigrean People's Liberation Front recently destroyed one of themicrowave relay stations connecting the Eritrean capital, Asmara,to the rest of the country.   Tigrean rebels took up arms 14 years ago, demanding a bigger sayin governing their province.   The news agency made no reference to a claim by the EritreanPeople's Liberation Front that it shot down a MiG-21 fighter jetFriday and captured the pilot, identified as Capt. Tilahun Begarso.   Voice of the Broad Masses of Eritrea, the clandestine rebelradio, said the plane was hit during ongoing fighting northeast ofAsmara. It claimed 100 government soldiers were killed and 216wounded in a battle there Thursday.   The Assab attack report is the first of its kind since PresidentMengistu Haile Mariam ended years of official silence March 30about insurgencies in the northernmost neighboring provinces ofEritrea and Tigre.   In his first admission that his government is at war, Mengistuannounced an imminent offensive against the rebels, who havecaptured several towns in major victories this year.   No foreign relief agencies have been based in Assab since thegovernment on April 6 expelled about 60 Western relief workers fromthe war-torn provinces, citing ``personnel risks.''   The expulsions have jeopardized a massive Western-fundedemergency relief operation to help an estimated 3.2 million peoplethreatened with starvation in Eritrea and Tigre, the provincesworst hit by drought.   This week, following a visit by a U.N. troubleshooter, thegovernment allowed back into Asmara four U.N. workers who supervisetrucking and a big airlift of relief food forced by the war.   Chester Crocker, assistant U.S. secretary of state, charged inWashington on Saturday that Mengistu banned the foreigners toremove witnesses as the government prepares for all-out war.   ``He doesn't want anyone to see what's going on up there becauseit's going to be bloody,'' Crocker told the African and HumanRights subcommittees of the House of Representatives' ForeignAffairs Committee.   Western diplomats and relief officials have expressed similarfears.   They have accused the government and rebels of jeopardizing thelives of drought victims in pursuit of military victory.   Mengistu inherited the insurgencies when, with a clique ofmilitary officers, he helped overthrow Emperor Haile Selassie in1974.</TEXT></DOC>
