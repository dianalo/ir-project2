Hezbollah said a Shiite clergyman drove the explosives-ladenpickup truck.   It also said the seizure of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid hamperedefforts to free the 16 Western captives in Lebanon, eight of whomare Americans. Hezbollah is believed to be an umbrella organizationfor groups holding most of the hostages.   In Washington, President Bush promised to pursue everydiplomatic channel to win freedom for te American hostages, butsaid there would be no ``trading off or negotiating.''   A Tehran newspaper said Iran would help free hostages if Israelreleased Obeid and if four Iranians missing in Lebanon since 1982,believed long dead, were located. On Tuesday, another Tehran papersaid Iran would help if Washington released $2 billion in Iranianassets frozen a decade ago when the U.S. Embassy was seized.   Sheik Mohammed Hussein Fadlallah, spiritual adviser ofHezbollah, said of the bombing: ``We tell Israel this is a downpayment. Much more will follow.''   Hezbollah, whose name means Party of God, said the suicidebomber was Sheik Asaad Birro, a 24-year-old Lebanese Shiite clericfrom the Bekaa Valley. Israel said two people were in the pickup,which exploded at midmorning in the buffer zone the Israeliscontrol just north of the border.   Five Israeli soldiers and a member of the allied South LebanonArmy militia were reported wounded.   Uri Lubrani, Israel's coordinator for south Lebanon, said onMiddle East Television the Israelis would retaliate, but did notsay when or how.   ``Israel will deal with the Hezbollah as it deals with all theorganizations which threaten the normal life of the securityzone,'' he said. ``Violence has two edges and Israel will retaliatein one way or another ... in due time, in a place it will choose.''   Sheik Sobhi Tofaili, another Hezbollah leader, said there wouldbe more attacks and the seizure of Obeid would ``mushroom into anexplosive volcano in the face of Israel.''   Israeli commandos abducted Obeid, 33, and two aides from thesouthern Lebanon village of Jibchit on July 28. Israel has offeredto trade him and its estimated 300-400 Shiite prisoners for threeIsraeli soldiers held in Lebanon and the Western hostages.   A statement released by the Hezbollah information centerdescribed the seizure of Obeid, who was affiliated with theorganization, as a ``terrorist crime of piracy.''   It reiterated previous rejections of the Israeli exchangeproposal. Israel has urged hostage-holding factions to negotiate atrade through the international Red Cross.   ``The Zionist enemy has suffered a bitter dismay because of hisfailure to achieve his objectives from the crime of abducting SheikAbdul Karim Obeid,'' the Hezbollah statement said.   ``It is clear that things have backfired adversely on the enemyafter this foolish crime. It has become impossible to release theIsraeli POWs and all ways for a possible swap have been blocked.   ``Moreover, the refusal of the enemy to release Sheik Obeid andhis two relatives, and his linkage of the problem of the ZionistPOWs with that of the hostages, might hurt the West and furthercomplicate the hostage issue.''   The statement said ``efforts for the release of the Westernhostages in Lebanon are passing through their greatest setbackbecause of the foolhardiness committed by the racist Zionists whoappear perfectly willing to sacrifice all others for their selfishinterests.''   Hezbollah said the West should force Israel to free Obeid, anddescribed Israel's claims about statements the cleric made underinterrogation as ``false and misleading.''   Officials in Israel have said Obeid confessed underinterrogation to helping plan attacks on Israel and the abductionFeb. 17, 1988 of Lt. Col. William R. Higgins while he was on U.N.duty in south Lebanon.   Higgins' captors said they hanged the U.S. Marine officer July31 in retaliation for Obeid's abduction.   His wife and the FBI say they believe Higgins is dead, but thequestion of when he died has not been resolved. Some reports say hewas killed last year.   A police spokesman in Beirut said the car bombing was reportedat 9:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. EDT) on a road near the Christian towns ofMarjayoun and Qleiaa, both 5 miles north of the Israeli border.   Israeli soldiers and the allied South Lebanon Army, apredominantly Christian militia, patrol the zone, which varies indepth from about 6 to 10 miles.   Two jeeps, a tank, two armored personnel carriers and ahalftrack made up the Israeli convoy, Hezbollah said.   It released a color photograph of a Birro, the suicide driver,behind a desk flanked by flags of Hezbollah and Iran. Behind himwere a poster of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini and Ali Khamenei, whobecame Iran's spiritual leader after Khomeini died in June.   Hezbollah said the attack was carried out to ``declare ourloyalty to the path of Imam Khomeini and his successor AyatollahKhamenei.''</TEXT></DOC>
