Background</ITAG>In 1982, the Crow Tribe submitted to OSMRE its proposed Abandoned MineReclamation Plan under the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of1977 (SMCRA), Pub. L. 95-87. At that time OSMRE requested public commentson the adequacy of the proposed plan, 47 FR 21274-21276 (May 18, 1982).Following an internal review of the proposed plan and public comments,OSMRE met with the Crow Tribe to discuss certain revisions to its plan.In 1984, the Crow Tribe submitted a revised reclamation plan. Since OSMRElacked authority under SMCRA to proceed further in the process for approvingTribal reclamation plans, OSMRE took no further action on the Crow Tribe'sproposed plan. The public comment period, however, has remained open since1984 pending authorizing legislation. On July 11, 1987, the President signed the fiscal year 1987 supplementalappropriations bill which included authority for the Crow, Hopi, and NavajoTribes to obtain abandoned mine land reclamation (AMLR) programs withoutfirst having to obtain approval of Tribal surface mining regulatory programs.In response to this legislation, OSMRE notified the Crow Tribe that itwas now able to consider final action on the proposed plan. The Crow Tribehas submitted additional revisions to the plan. This notice announces thatOSMRE is in the process of finalizing its review of the Crow AMLR plan,and that the public comments period will close November 25, 1988. Title IV of the Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act, Pub. L. 95-87,30 U.S.C. 1201 <T3>et seq., </T3>establishes an abandoned mine land program for the purposesof reclaiming and restoring land and water resources adversely affectedby past mining. This program is funded by a reclamation fee imposed uponthe production of coal. Lands and water eligible for reclamation are thosethat were mined or affected by mining and abandoned or left in an inadequatereclamation status prior to August 3, 1977, and for which there is no continuingreclamation responsibility under State/Tribal or Federal law. Title IV provides that if the Secretrary determines that a State or Tribehas developed and submitted a program for reclamation of abandoned minesand has the ability and necessary State or Tribal legislation to implementthe provisions of Title IV, the Secretary may approve the State or Tribalprogram and grant to the State or Tribe exclusive reponsibility and authorityto implement the provisions of the approved program. OSMRE has received a proposed AMLR plan from the Crow Tribe. The purposeof this submission is to determine both the intent and capability to assumeresponsibility for administering and conducting the provisions of SMCRAand OSMRE's Abandoned Mine Land Reclamation (AMLR) Program (30 CFR Chapter7, Subchapter R) as published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(FR) on June 30, 1982, 47 FR 28574-28604.This notice describes the nature of the proposed program and sets forthinformation concerning public participation in the Secretary's determinationof whether or not the submitted plan may be approved. The public participationrequirements for the consideration of a State or Tribal AMLR plan are foundin 30 CFR 884.13 and 884.14. Additional information may be found undercorresponding sections of the preamble to OSMRE's AMLR Program Final Rulesas published in October 25, 1978 (43 FR 49932-49952).    The receipt of the Crow Tribe's plan is the first step in the process thatwill result in the establishment of a comprehensive program for the reclamationof abandoned mine lands on the Crow Tribal Lands.    By submitting a proposed plan, the Crow Tribe has indicated that it wishesto be primarily responsible for this program. If the submission, as hereaftermodified, is approved by the Secretary, the Crow Tribe will have primaryresponsibility for the reclamation of abandoned mine lands on Crow TribalLands.    The Department intends to continue to discuss the Crow Tribe's proposedplan with representatives of the Tribe throughout the review process. Allcontacts between OSMRE personnel and representatives of the Tribe willbe conducted in accordance with OSMRE's guidelines on contacts with Statespublished September 19, 1979 at 44 FR 54444.<ITAG tagnum="84">II.
