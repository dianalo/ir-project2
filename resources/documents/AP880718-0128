He hinted at a negotiated solution to the nearly 8-year-oldstruggle and, after the U.S. Navy shot down an Iranian airlinerJuly 3, even cautioned against violent retaliation.   Rafsanjani has built personal power through his job as speakerof Iran's parliament, the Majlis.   On June 2, several Iraqi military victories, revolutionarypatriarch Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini made him commander-in-chiefand he has emerged as the man most likely to hold temporal powerafter the death of Khomeini, who is 88.   Rafsanjani, 53, said on Iranian television Monday that Khomeini,who set the previous policy to reject a cease-fire, made decidedSunday to accept it.   His recent statements would suggest Rafsanjani is a moderate,but the word has little meaning in the murk of Iranian politics,where positions come and go like ghosts in a fog.   In a speech last month, Rafsanjani mentioned the possibility of``non-military solutions to the war,'' but at Friday prayers July 8he exhorted young men to go to the front ``to determine the fate ofthe Iraqi imposed-war right there on the battlefield.''   The first communique of his newly formed military GeneralCommand said it was the duty of Iranians to ``resist and hope forultimate divine victory.''   It said the goal was to mobilize all military and civilianpotential and change the military balance in Iran's favor.   Rafsanjani also had suggested, however, that it was time forIran to emerge from its international isolation.   As Iran announced its acceptance Monday of the year-old U.N.Security Council truce resolution, the General Command said: ``Weonce again urge the Iranian people to man the war fronts toconfront the enemies' aggressive nature and foil their criminalacts.''   Earlier this month, Rafsanjani said on Iranian television: ``Oneof the wrong things we did, in the revolutionary atmosphere, wasconstantly to make enemies. We pushed those who could have beenneutral into hostility.''   Western diplomats said Monday most Iranians are weary of the warand the leadership may be able to explain the policy shift withrelative ease, but that Iranians would be wrong to think ending thewar will bring a quick return to economic health.   ``The economy is in a desolate state,'' one diplomat based inTehran said recently. ``Two-thirds of the country's industrialcapacity is idle. With spare parts and trained personnel lacking,it will take years.''   Since 1980, the year after Khomeini's revolution overthrew thelate Shah Mohammade Reza Pahlavi, Rafsanjani has dominated theparliament. He has built support among the 350,000 RevolutionaryGuards Corps, which he briefly commanded, and other power centers.   Iranians call him ``kuseh,'' the shark: some say for thepolitical ruthlessness and cunning that lie behind his smile andsly wit, others say for his lack of facial hair, revealing hisMongolian ancestry, in a nation of bearded men.   Although Khomeini's designated heir is Ayatollah Hussein-AliMontazeri, most political analysts believe Rafsanjani will holdreal power with one or two others after the patriarch dies.   Khomeini supported his temperate response to the destruction ofthe airliner, in which 290 people were killed, with a message toMontazeri, who had urged ``thorough plans for a struggle againstU.S. political, economic, cultural and military targets.''   While he is close to Khomeini and considered the second mostpowerful man in Iran, Rafsanjani's middle-level clerical rank ofhojatoleslam rules him out as the future ``wali-faqih,'' or supremespiritual leader.   Rafsanjani helped give the Islamic revolution direction throughthe turmoil of its early days and his rise to prominence was rapid.   ``He's not brilliant as an organizer and he doesn't haveoriginal ideas, but he's a manipulator and he's intelligent,'' saidAbolhassan Bani Sadr, the first Iranian president after therevolution.   Many Western leaders see Rafsanjani as the more acceptable faceof the Islamic revolution because he advocates links with the West.That is not the result of less commitment to the revolution, butbecause he believes Iran can gain from such dealings.   He was at the center of the clandestine arms-for-hostages dealwith the United States in 1985-86 and, when it was uncovered,Montazeri and other rivals sought to discredit him.   Word of the secret dealings with ``the Great Satan'' _ theUnited States _ was leaked to a Beirut magazine by Mehdi Hashemi,brother-in-law of Montazeri's son.   Displaying the political agility that has allowed him to surviveoften- bloody infighting, Rafsanjani had Mehdi Hashemi arrested fortreason, murder and kidnapping, thus discrediting Montazeri.   Hashemi and several associates were executed last September.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Ed Blanche is the Mideast news editor for TheAssociated Press, based in Nicosia.
