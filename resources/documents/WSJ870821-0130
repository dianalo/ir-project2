McFarlane has misread my essay, and regret that he got upset at something I never said (letters, Aug. 14). Nowhere did I suggest that he favored the arms-for-hostage policy, and I have frequently underlined the intensity of his opposition to it. Our only disagreement on this matter was whether any part of the initiative should be retained. As he stated in his letter, he urged that the entire undertaking be shut down; I felt that a part of it -- testing the seriousness of those Iranians who told us they wanted to change the nature of their government, and who opposed the shipment of arms to Iran -- warranted further examination.    Mr. McFarlane then writes that it was I &quot;alone, no one else -- who consistently brought {to him} the most outrageous Iranian demands for arms,&quot; and implies that that somehow suggests I was in favor of accepting those demands. That is a non sequitur; the conclusion does not follow from the premise. I did, indeed, transmit the Iranian demands, since I (alone, as no other American was present at the early meetings) had been instructed by Mr. McFarlane to attend the meetings and tell him what had transpired. I would have been derelict had I not reported accurately.    But accurate reportage does not imply concurrence, and I urged that we cease talking about such exchanges, from October of 1985 until the entire initiative blew up more than a year later. My opposition to the arms-for-hostages policy was expressed to more than half a dozen top officials of the government, and is demonstrated by both documentary evidence and the testimony of many of those officials.
