These restrictions will most likely be proposed inthe form of an ordinance that the district board would ask city councils andthe county supervisors to adopt.;    Proposals in addition to bans on newpools and landscaping would forbid turf watering in most areas, allow golfcourse fairways and roughs to dry up and require that self-regenerating watersofteners be disconnected.;    Rationing rules now require a 20 percentreduction from 1987 use levels in the North County and 25 percent in the SouthCounty. That figure is expected to increase to at least 30 percent on April1.;    The supply outlook is grim. There is virtually no water in countyreservoirs. The federal government has cut three-fourths of the water that thecounty receives from the Central Valley Project. San Francisco's Hetch Hetchysystem will cut supplies to Santa Clara County customers by 45 percent. Andofficials are bracing for an 85 percent reduction in water from the StateWater Project.;    IF YOU'RE INTERESTED; The Santa Clara Valley Water DistrictBoard of Directors will discuss drought measures during a special meeting at 1p.m. today at district headquarters, 5750 Almaden Expressway, San Jose.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  FRANK SWEENEY, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910221  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  360  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday February 21, 199100052043,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
