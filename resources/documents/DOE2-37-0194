The area investigated is the Pembina Easyford CardiumUnit No. 1 in Alberta and consists of 15 water injection wells, 78 producingwells and 15 shut-in wells. The ability to choose the best possible fracturestimulation candidate is very important in order to maximize productionand revenue. To compare wells consistently in a given area, pressurebuild-up techniques are utilized. An up-to-date isobaric map is required.An estimate of the slope of all the wells in the area is then determinedusing known slopes from build-up and fall-off tests. Since reservoirpressure and slope are given for all the wells, build-up calculationscan be done to determine skin factors and maximum anticipated flow rateswith a -4 skin factor. Once maximum rates for oil have been estimated,the wells with the greatest variance between actual oil production andestimated -4 skin oil production are investigated further to determinethe best fracture candidates. 7 refs., 8 figs., 2 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
