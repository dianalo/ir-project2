Two soldiers were also lightly wounded, an army spokesman saidon condition of anonymity.   It was the fourth such incident on the Israel-Lebanon border ineight days.   The Syrian-backed Democratic Front for the Liberation ofPalestine claimed responsibility in a communique.   The raid was in reprisal for retaliatory Israeli air raids onguerrilla bases in Lebanon on Wednesday, according to thecommunique released in Beirut.   Also Sunday, Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir warned Jewishsettlers to stop attacking Arab communities in the Israeli-occupiedterritories.   Settlers have conducted raids to punish Palestinians for stoningattacks on Israeli-owned cars. A 13-year-old Palestinian girl diedin a revenge raid last week.   ``No one is entitled to take the law into his own hands,''Shamir said in a statement released after a weekly Cabinet meeting.   About 70,000 settlers live in 130 Jewish settlements in the WestBank and Gaza Strip, which were captured from Jordan and Egypt inthe 1967 Middle East war. The Gaza Strip and West Bank are home to1.7 million Palestinians.   One Jewish settler accused of attacks on Palestinians has beenbanned from entering Arab areas, the Maariv daily reported Sunday.   The settler, David Axelrod, 22, allegedly assaulted an Israelisoldier patrolling the West Bank town of Hebron last month.   A Defense Ministry official confirmed the activities of a Jewishsettler had been restricted by Jerusalem but would not name him. Hesaid the order was the first of its kind in the 18-month-oldPalestinian uprising against Israeli control of the territories.   Also Sunday, 22-year-old Khaled al Natur died of a gunshot woundhe suffered in a clash with troops two days earlier, officials atRamallah Hospital in the West Bank said.   His death raised to 505 the number of Palestinians killed sincethe uprising began. Twenty-two Israelis have died.   The border clash was the fourth infiltration attempt into Israelsince May 28. The incident began before dawn when guerrillas openedfire on Israeli troops patrolling a border security road north ofthe Misgav Am collective farm.   Israeli Sgt. Maj. Hassin Muktaren, who was leading the troops onfoot, died instantly of a gunshot wound, army officials said. Thethree Arab commandos were killed when the soldiers returned fire,they said.   Israel set up the security zone in southern Lebanon in 1985 toprotect its border.   Meanwhile, Omar Qassem, 48, a senior Palestinian guerrillaleader who was captured by Israeli soldiers after leading across-border guerrilla raid from Jordan in 1968, died Sunday in anIsraeli hospital, his family said.   Qassem was hospitalized about two months ago with gall bladder,kidney and liver problems. He had been serving a life sentenceordered by an Israeli military court.   His death came as Palestinian activists held a news conferenceto appeal to Israel to release him. It also occurred as thegovernment considered exchanging Qassem for the remains of anIsraeli soldier believed to have died after capture in Lebanon in1983, Israeli sources said.</TEXT></DOC>
