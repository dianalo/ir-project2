In this context one of the possible waysto alleviate the situation is to reduce the sulphur content of coal.In many coal seams initial sulphur contents are unacceptably high andblending with seams of low sulphur value is practised. However, in thefuture, blending on a large scale to reduce the sulphur content of manyof the United Kingdom coals may not be possible due to the limited reservesof low sulphur coal. Currently to obtain a low sulphur product, coalpreparation treatment or some selective extraction is practised in certainseams, however, in many cases it is not possible to separate sulphurfrom coal in the pre-combustion stage. This paper discusses the sulphur,ash relationship in two seams, the Cannel Row in North Staffordshireand the Flockton Thin of the Yorkshire Coalfield, which are examinedwith a view to identifying patterns of regional variation. Once theseare established the possibility of selective planning of mine workingsto avoid the high sulphur areas in these seams is discussed. 13 refs.,16 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
