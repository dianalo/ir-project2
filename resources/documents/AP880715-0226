Iran admitted its troops withdrew from the mountain town of HajjOmran in the Sulaimaniya region of Kurdistan.   Iran's powerful Hashemi Rafsanjani, the speaker of Parliamentand acting commander in chief of the armed forces, declared thatafter the recent military setbacks, his country should prepare fora long-term war.   Iraq and Iran have been at war since September 1980.   Thursday's retreat was the third by the Iranians in that area inthree days. It came as Iraqi troops launched widespread mopupoperations in the south, tightening their grip on areas recentlyevacuated by the Iranians.   State-run Baghdad Radio, monitored in Nicosia, broke intoregular programming to announce the fall of Hajj Omran after afierce battle between Iraq's 5th Army Corps and Iran'sRevolutionary Guards.   Tehran's official Islamic Republic News Agency, also monitoredin Nicosia, said Iranian combatants in Hajj Omran withdrew to ``newdefensive positions ... The evacuation ... is for a moreappropriate deployment of combat forces in other defensive lines.''   Hajj Omran, Penjwin and Halabja are all in the Sulaimaniyaregion, which is inhabited by Iranian-backed, autonomy-seekingKurdish rebels.   Iran captured the region in an offensive last March. It claimedat the time that 5,000 Kurds were killed and 7,000 injured inHalabja when the Iraqis pounded the town with chemical weaponsdespite a world ban on such weapons.   The Iranians admitted withdrawing from Halabja on Tuesday andthe Iraqis said on Wednesday that they regained the Penjwin basin.Iran said only that its forces are regrouping in Penjwin.   That left the Iranians entrenched only in the town of Penjwin,encircled by Iraqis on all the surrounding mountain peaks.   In the south, Iraqi troops continued to consolidate positions inareas they retook from the Iranians in four consecutive thrustssince April, the Iraqi News Agency reported, monitored in Nicosia.   The Iraqis captured the Zubaidat region in a four-hour battleTuesday and chased the fleeing troops on Wednesday all the way toDehloran, an Iranian city about 30 miles east of the border. Theywere still in Dehloran on Thursday.   Iraq took the initiative in the war in April, dislodging theIranians from the Faw peninsula in that month, and from theShalmcheh and oil-rich Majnoon islands in May and June.   The Iranians now control a few scattered pockets in the centralsector of the 730-mile warfront.   Ali Reza Moayeri, Iran's deputy prime minister for foreignaffairs, told Tehran radio on Thursday: ``At present the enemy isfully mobilized against us. we should go to war more strongly.''   In Manama, Bahrain, U.S. officials said the U.S. Navy wasescorting a Kuwaiti vessel in the Persian Gulf Thursday in the 47thconvoy of 1988.   The 46,723-ton liquefied gas carrier Gas Prince left KuwaitWednesday, the U.S. Central Command announced in Tampa, Fla.   The ship was among the first of 11 Kuwait-owned tankersre-registered under the U.S. flag last July, entitling them to Navyprotection from Iranian attack.   Soviet and Iraqi officials said in Moscow Thursday that thevisit there by Iraq's envoy Saadoun Hammadi failed to overcomeSoviet opposition to an international arms embargo against Iran.   ``We don't have any radical changes in our position,'' SovietForeign Ministry spokesman Vadim P. Perfilyev told a governmentnews briefing.   Hammadi, president of Iraq's National Council and a member ofits Revolutionary Command Council, told reporters earlier thatdifferences in views between his country and the Kremlin remained.   In Ankara, Turkey, Foreign Ministry spokesman Nazim Berker saidtwo Turkish soldiers were killed by gunfire from Iran whilepatrolling the border Wednesday.
