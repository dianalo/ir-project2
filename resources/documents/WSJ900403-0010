The chancellor said theBundesbank recommendation would be studied carefully, butstressed that preparatory talks were still under way.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I expressly acknowledge my responsibility for the peopleof the DDR {East Germany}. I repeatedly underlined my pledgeto solidarity during the DDR election campaign, and I standby this,&quot; Mr. Kohl asserted. He reaffirmed plans to achieve acurrency union with East Germany this summer, but offered nospecific conversion rates. Talks on monetary union willresume with the formation of a new East German government,Mr. Kohl said.   The controversial Bundesbank plan would limit the 1-for-1conversion rate for East Germany's 160 billion East Germanmarks in savings to 2,000 West German marks ($1,181.40) perperson. The central bank also stipulated that the remainderof savings -- as well as wages, pensions and debt -- beconverted at a rate of one West German mark for two EastGerman marks. This would minimize strains on East Germanindustry and lessen the inflationary impact on West Germanmonetary policy, officials explained.   Chancellor Kohl had promised a 1-for-1 rate for saverswhile campaigning for East German conservative candidateslast month. East German leaders say their electorate hadwidely interpreted the assurance as meaning that all savings,wages and pensions of the 16 million East Germans would beconverted at the more-favorable rate.   The discord over the knotty currency issue has complicatedChancellor Kohl's hitherto mostly smooth progress towardGerman unity, capped by the conservative victory in EastGermany's March 18 elections. Finance Minister Theo Waigelhas endorsed the Bundesbank's plan, but other senior Bonncabinet members were keeping their distance. Foreign MinisterHans-Dietrich Genscher said in a radio interview yesterdaythe Bundesbank recommendations &quot;won't be the last word andcan't be the last word.&quot;   The Social Democratic opposition party in Bonn was quickto exploit the dispute. Oskar Lafontaine, the SPD's candidatefor chancellor in West Germany's December elections, accusedMr. Kohl of breaking a promise in what he called &quot;voterdeception&quot; after many East German voters chose a three-partyalliance led by the East German Christian Democratic Union onthe basis of Mr. Kohl's conversion promise.   East Germans officials fear that a dilution of East Germansavings and incomes would impoverish normal wage earners.They predicted demonstrations and a new wave of emigration ifthe Bundesbank plan were adopted. East German union leaderswarned of imminent strikes by protesting workers unless aclear signal was sent from Bonn.   East Germany's premier-designate, Lothar de Maiziere, saidyesterday his East German Christian Democrats are sticking toits promise for a broad 1-for-1 exchange.   &quot;We don't believe it possible that salaries, wages, andpensions can be treated on a 1-for-2 basis,&quot; Mr. de Maizieresaid in East Berlin. He observed that average East Germanwages already amount to only one-third of West German levels.   West German monetary officials worry that the vast gap inWest German and East German productivity levels could unleashinflation.   Bonn already is expected to have to come up with as muchas 50 billion marks a year to rebuild East Germany'scrumbling infrastructure. And because Bonn would have to footthe bill for any East German crisis -- such as massunemployment or a collapse of the social security system --Mr. Kohl is seen walking a fine line between promises to theEast German electorate and the advice of his monetaryexperts.</TEXT></DOC>
