The fact that many of thosedealings, which were prosecuted for extended periods, are not being materializedinto actual projects (suffice it to mention those of Mexico, Pakistan,Turkey, Egypt, China, etc.) has provided a slow shift of the title rolein the international nuclear picture to the apparent main obstacles tothat materialization, that is, financial and/or non-proliferation aspects.But, in fact, a growing, well planned participation by a country's industry,its organizations and its individuals in its nuclear programme is clearlythe most important product (other than, obviously, power itself) thatcan be derived from such a programme. A product from which many othersectors benefit. This paper deals with significant aspects of the nationalparticipation effort, among other: existing industrial infrastructure,and its evaluation; technology transfer channels and its implications;situations where national participation may look less easy to implement:turnkey projects, shop-mounted or barge-installed blocks or completeplants, etc.; progressive participation along the project, and with subsequentprojects; the role of the utility and the Government. Cases drawn fromthe experience of the author's company in several countries, and speciallythe case of Spain, are commented.</TEXT></DOC>
