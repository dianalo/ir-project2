The entire light waterreactor (LWR) nuclear fuel cycle is considered, from mining of uraniumore to disposing of radioactive wastes. The radiation dose equivalentsgiven here are based on reviews made by various governmental organizations.Dose estimates are calculated for the individuals in the general populationwho may receive the maximum exposure and for the population within 80km of facilities that are typical of those in operation during the early1980s. These estimates are for routine operations, which are taken toinclude certain abnormal occurrences described as ``anticipated operationaloccurrences,'' and from accidents and incidents during transporation.The estimates do not include radiation doses from major accidents, fromdecommissioning nuclear facilities, or from research and developmentfacilities. Fuel reprocessing and high-level waste disposal are discussedalthough neither is part of the US fuel cycle at this time. 232 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
