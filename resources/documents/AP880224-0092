Roh will take the oath of office as the 6th president at aheavily-guarded ceremony at the National Assembly with no generalpublic participation. Outgoing President Chun Doo-hwan and otherleaders will attend the ceremony.   The inauguration also will mark the start of the Sixth Republicas the country adopts a new constitution that provides for greaterpolitical and individiual freedoms. Roh has promised the republicwill be ``the great era of the common man.''   The charismatic Roh, 55, is committed to ending the nation'slong tradition of authoritarian rule that strictly limitedpolitical activity and ruthlessly cracked down on opposition. Healso has pledged to end the country's confrontational politics andviolent regional divisions and to redress social and economicinequality.   Roh on Monday called for a government that ``is loved by thepeople and run in accordance with democratic principles to suit anew era.''   The new president faces the challenge of ending authoritarianrule in a nation that has never had a peaceful transfer of power.The nation has been dominated by civilian and military strongmensince its creation in 1948 and its politics are turbulent and oftenviolent.   Police were on alert in Seoul and other cities today afterreports that radical students and dissidents may attempt to stageanti-Roh protests. Radical groups have refused to recognize Roh'selection and contend he is intent on continuing authoritarian rule.   Radical groups called for anti-government protests in Seoul andother cities today and Thursday. Detachments of riot police wereseen guarding key points in some areas of Seoul and policeofficials said reserves were on alert.   More than 200 student and dissident leaders were being watchedin case they attempted to organize protests, officials said. Policealso were guarding festive arches erected in Seoul for theinauguration in case dissidents attempted to wreck them.   Chun warned at a farewell dinner in Seoul tonight that politicalstability and continued expansion were vital. He warned againstpolitical unrest.   ``I am convinced that there must not, and will not, be anyrepeat of political chaos that imperils the country or social chaosthat threatens national survival,'' he said.   Chun, who took power with military backing in 1980 when he andRoh were senior generals, is to head a presidential advisory board.He was to leave office in a separate ceremony Thursday.   A low-key inaugural ceremony was planned for Thursday with Rohscheduled to take the oath of office in the square in front of theNational Assembly building. But attendance was by invitation onlyand there were no plans for celebrations or public attendance.   Factory workers, street cleaners and other ordinary people wereinvited to attend the ceremony along with officials, academics, andother representatives of Korean society, officials said.   Envoys from 88 nations, including Prime Minister NoboruTakeshita of Japan and the premiers of Sri Lanka and Fiji, were toattend the inauguration. The United States was to be represented byTreasury Secretary James Baker.   Roh won the country's first democratic presidential election in16 years on Dec. 16 with 36.6 percent of the vote. He defeatedrival opposition candidates Kim Young-sam and Kim Dae-jung, whosplit the opposition vote.   Roh, a former general, is identified with the military-backedgovernments that have ruled the country since 1961 and many Koreansare doubtful if he can achieve massive democratic change.   Opposition parties contend Roh's inauguration will simply signala change of figurehead and the government will continue to be runby the armed forces and an entrenched elite of government officialsand business leaders.</TEXT></DOC>
