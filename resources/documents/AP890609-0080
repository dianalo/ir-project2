The speech was televised nationally, as were scenes fromdemonstrations in several provincial cities, where there werereports that dissidents and supporters of the pro-democracy movementwere being arrested.   In Beijing, hundreds of troops took up positions around collegecampuses, where the nation's pro-democracy protests began inmid-April. Many students have returned home or gone into hidingsince the army declared martial law in the capital and violentlyended the protests over the weekend.   In Washington, President Bush said Thursday the United States``can't have totally normal relations'' with China until itsgovernment recognizes the rights of the students who led thedemonstrations. But Bush, in a televised news conference, rejectedsuggestions he impose more sanctions on China.   Deng praised the suppression of the pro-democracy movement in anaddress to officers of the People's Liberation Army. He thanked themfor their actions, which resulted in the deaths of hundreds if notthousands of Beijing residents.   Deng said the people behind the democratic movement wanted to``overthrow communism and do away with the socialist system and thePeople's Republic of China and establish a capitalist republic.''   He said, ``Facing a life-threatening situation, our troops neverforgot the people, never forgot the party, never forgot thecountry's interest.''   Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and60,000 injured in the assault, according to a Chinese group in WestGermany, the Union of Chinese Students in the Federal Republic. Thegovernment says 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed; Chineseand diplomats say up to 3,000 died.   Deng had not been seen in public since he met Soviet PresidentMikhail S. Gorbachev on May 16. There have been numerous rumors inrecent weeks that Deng was dead or critically ill.   On his right was conservative Premier Li Peng, who declaredmartial law in Beijing on May 20. On Thursday, Li also praised thesoldiers' action in a speech. It was the first appearance by a highgovernment official in two weeks, indicating China's hard-lineleaders were gaining control of the situation.   Conspicuously absent was Communist Party General Secretary ZhaoZiyang, who was reportedly stripped of power by Deng after opposingthe military crackdown on the students, who were demandingdemocratic reforms, such as freedom of the press, and an end toofficial corruption.   Qiao Shi, a Politburo Standing Committee member and a topcandidate to replace Zhao, was present, as was Vice Premier YaoYilin, a conservative economist and Wan Li, current NationalPeople's Congress chief.   The television also showed Deng and the others shaking hands withtroops inside the Great Hall of the People.   Deng's appearance with the other hardliners gave an impression ofparty unity as the military extended its control over the capitaland police in other large cities began rounding up participants inlarge-scale disturbances that have occurred since the attack onBeijing on June 3 and 4.   Television showed what appeared to be burned out, smolderingblocks in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan province. Violentdemonstrations broke out in Chengdu following the weekend crackdownin Beijing. Scenes of protest were shown in several other citiesincluding Shanghai, Changsha, Wuhan and Harbin.   The television showed dozens of people being arrested for allegeddestructive acts during the protests.   In Shanghai today, 50,000 students and others gathered to mournthe deaths of six people who were killed earlier this week when atrain crashed through a barricade set up on railway tracks.   A Chinese source said police had begun making arrests at night inat least one apartment complex. The government has reported onlyarrests of people allegedly caught trying to set fire to buses orengaged in other violence.   ``We know they're picking people up all over the place,'' saidone Western diplomat. ``Don't let people tell you things are calmingdown. They're not.''   In Beijing, gas stations opened and food was more plentiful inmarkets. City buses rolled past the tanks on Tiananmen Square forthe first time since June 3. There were no reports of soldiersfiring on crowds.   More than a dozen tanks and hundreds of armored personnelcarriers could be seen on the square, which has been turned into avast military encampment since the army ousted student protesterswith gunfire.   Concern that factional fighting between rival military groupsmight turn Beijing into a killing field abated as troops fromvarious armies took up stations inside the city without majorconflicts.   Those fears prompted an exodus of foreigners from the capital,with most embassies ordering out all dependents and non-essentialstaff and many arranging special flights out.   The U.S. Embassy said registered Americans in China had droppedfrom 8,800 before the military crackdown to less than 5,000. Lessthan 400 Americans were in Beijing, down from 1,500.</TEXT></DOC>
