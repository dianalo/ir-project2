Ayittey (editorial page,March 28). However, the emotional &quot;bleeding heart&quot; hype in&quot;Troubled Township: South Africa Blacks Speak Freely Now, andPressure Pretoria&quot; (page one, April 4) perpetuates the myththat the Afrikaners and apartheid are the cause of allsocial, economic and political discrepancies in SouthernAfrica. It was nauseating.   The world community, and the U.S., has to come to gripswith the phenomenon and effects of international &quot;apartheid&quot;so that we can, one day, deal more effectively and sensiblywith the separate and very unequal development of nations andpeoples.</LP><TEXT>   Casper H.
