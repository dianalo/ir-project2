The pact was an appropriate measure by the U.S. government to redress predatory Japanese business practices.    I must disagree, however, with the view that the government can resuscitate a largely crippled U.S. semiconductor industry. It is customary to blame our fragile competitive posture exclusively on unfair Japanese trade practices. But it is folly to believe that merely by improving market access in Japan and preventing dumping here that our semiconductor industry will &quot;survive and prosper.&quot; We face fundamental structural deficiencies that impair our ability to compete globally.    Every major Japanese semiconductor competitor is an integrated and diversified manufacturer. This provides them with a relatively stable captive base of internal demand, an advanced opportunity to be designed into end-user applications and the diversification necessary to weather industry cycles. Conversely, U.S. companies serve predominantly as vendors to external users and thus operate in a more haphazard environment.    U.S. companies typically scale back operations during a recession, leaving them unprepared to maintain market share during the subsequent recovery. Alternatively, Japanese firms continue to invest in downturns, when they are able to expand more readily and less expensively.    Last, the U.S. cost of capital is nearly double that in Japan. A higher cost of capital causes U.S. companies to eschew projects that their Japanese counterparts can finance profitably, including capacity expansions, investments in new technologies and new product developments. It is more appropriate to claim Japan has dumped its capital structure rather than its products onto the U.S. market.    Government policy is an integral part of an overall competitive strategy. But U.S. manufacturers are poorly advised to believe that government intervention alone will revive international competitiveness.    James P. Iuliano   Division Controller   VLSI Technology Inc.    San Jose, Calif.   ---   Mr. Yoffie argues that &quot;timely, effective trade policy is part of the solution, not the problem.&quot; He blames long-run supply and demand pressures, technical glitches and dumping as the reasons for high prices and shortages in the DRAM market, rather than the U.S.-Japan semiconductor pact.    Within one month of the agreement, chip prices had doubled in the spot market. This was the result of a short-run decrease in supply not a long-run increase in demand. Between August 1986 and August 1987, while demand rose 30%, Japanese producers cut production by 32%. The Japanese government forced these production cuts so that gray-market dumping would cease. The U.S. government caused this by forcing average cost pricing rather than marginal cost pricing.    Mr. Yoffie makes it seem as if control of the commodity chip markets is the key to competitiveness in the information technology industry. If this is the case, then the U.S. is particularly well situated in this industry. IBM is the world's largest manufacturer of DRAMS, and the U.S. microchip industry as of 1986 outproduced Japan. The U.S. also holds the lead in many other facets of information technology as well.    By arguing for government involvement with markets, Mr. Yoffie succumbs to the very beliefs that Adam Smith warned us against -- namely, that competition is harmful. When mistakes are made in a competitive environment, government is often called in to help. However, in the end, it is competitive pressures that win.    The chip agreement has raised costs to end-use producers and consumers of their products. Some argue that this has had a negative impact on employment in the U.S. Other say that it has helped Japanese companies profit. I would argue that it interferes with the natural progression of an industry that shifts with the ebb and flow of technology.    No government is smart enough or quick enough to improve the efficiency of such an industry.    Brian S. Wesbury   Economic Research Officer   Harris Bank   Chicago</TEXT></DOC>
