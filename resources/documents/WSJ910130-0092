After the long-awaited meeting between the AfricanNational Congress's Mr. Mandela and the Inkatha FreedomParty's Mr. Buthelezi, the two political rivals issued ajoint statement calling for peace.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;The primary purpose of the meeting was to explore waysand means to bring about the final cessation of theviolence,&quot; said Mr. Mandela, reading the statement.   The two pledged &quot;to develop practical steps&quot; to end theviolence between the organizations. They promised to &quot;monitorall violations of the agreement and recommend appropriateaction.&quot; The details of how the agreement will be implementedwill be worked out through further discussion, Mr. Mandelaadded.   Messrs. Mandela and Buthelezi, who have avoided meetingeach other in the year since Mr. Mandela was released fromprison, were cordial with each other, even joking duringtheir news conference despite great differences in the toneof their opening statements.   Mr. Mandela's opening remarks were conciliatory. &quot;Right atthe outset we want to make one thing crystal clear,&quot; he said.&quot;We have not come here to apportion blame for the fact thatit has taken so long before we managed to sit around a tableof peace and reconciliation. Nor do we think that it wouldbenefit the cause of peace if we spent our time in thismeeting pointing fingers&quot; to lay blame for the violence. Mr.Mandela went on to thank Mr. Buthelezi, &quot;belated as it mightbe,&quot; for his efforts to win Mr. Mandela's release fromprison.   In contrast, Mr. Buthelezi's opening statement wasconfrontational. He lashed out at ANC leaders, including Mr.Mandela, for their past criticism of him. &quot;What has causedthe violence are these vilification campaigns which have beencarried on from the highest echelons of the ANC to the verylowest,&quot; he said.   In numerous comments since the ANC and Inkatha becameantagonistic in 1979, ANC leaders have portrayed Mr.Buthelezi as a tool of South Africa's white government. Mr.Buthelezi is chief minister of the homeland set aside forZulus by the central government. The creation of homelandsfor South African blacks is one of the basic elements of thegovernment's apartheid policies. While Inkatha is almostentirely a Zulu movement, many leaders of the ANC are fromthe Xhosa community. In Natal, almost all the dead in thefighting have been Zulus from both Inkatha and the ANC.   Inkatha always called for non-violent opposition toapartheid, while the ANC endorsed armed struggle. Mr.Buthelezi's advocacy of capitalism also won wide attentioninside and outside South Africa among those suspicious of theANC because of its endorsement of elements of statesocialism.   This was the first meeting between Mr. Mandela and Mr.Buthelezi since Mr. Mandela was arrested and imprisoned in1962.   It remains to be seen whether the joint call for peacewill be respected. Each of them had issued earlier individualappeals for an end to the killing without result. Mr. Mandelaand Mr. Buthelezi said that they would jointly visit sites ofclashes, but gave no dates for these trips.   Both men expressed caution about their ability to stop theviolence, which has decimated black communities in areasaround Durban and Johannesburg. Neither man is so &quot;simplisticto believe this is some sort of magic wand,&quot; Mr. Buthelezisaid.</TEXT></DOC>
