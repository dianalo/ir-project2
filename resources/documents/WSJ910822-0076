The value added to the dollar as a hedge against politicalstrife &quot;has been totally taken out&quot; by the reversal offortunes in Moscow, said Judy Rubenstein, a vice presidentand trader at Bank of America in Los Angeles.</LP><TEXT>   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7415marks, down 3.2% from 1.7985 late Tuesday. The U.S. currencyalso was trading at 136.55 yen, down from 137.22. Sterlingjumped to $1.6885, up 2.7% from $1.6439. The dollar setintraday lows at 1.7345 marks and 136.35 yen, well below itspre-coup levels of 1.7645 marks and 137.30 yen late Friday.   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 136.57yen, down from Tokyo's Wednesday quote of 137.18 yen, and at1.7425 marks, down from 1.7863 marks at Wednesday's close.   In Asia early Wednesday, before the collapse of the Sovietcoup attempt, the U.S. currency jumped up to intraday highsof 1.81 marks and 137.75 yen on reports that shots had beenfired in Moscow and that pro-democracy demonstrators had beenkilled in clashes with Soviet soldiers.   From that peak, the dollar went into a tailspin, spiralingdown to its lows early in the North American afternoon asrapid-fire headlines indicated the coup was crumbling. Mr.Gorbachev was returning to Moscow and the &quot;committee ofeight&quot; that grabbed power Monday fled.   By the end of New York trading, the dollar's directionremained unclear. Some dealers said the uptrend that began toemerge after last week's German interest rate tightening hasbeen wiped out, and that the dollar is headed lower. U.S.fund managers and other players were spotted putting onshort, or oversold, dollar positions Wednesday, dealers said.   Other participants contended that the market has merelyovershot its target in the haste to unload the U.S. currencyand are calling for the dollar to rebound.   The sell-off &quot;looks like it might have been overdone,&quot;said Carl F. Amendola, at Bayerische Hypotheken-undWechsel-Bank AG in New York. &quot;To shoot down below Friday'slevels seems a little out of context,&quot; especially since theshape of the Soviet Union remains unclear, he added.   The dollar's steep decline &quot;frustrates a lot of people,myself included,&quot; said John W. Lyman, corporate adviser atBank of Tokyo here. &quot;Just because Gorbachev is back in powerdoesn't mean the problems in Eastern Europe have gone away.&quot;   In any event, participants said the market is likely torefocus its attention on factors that have dominated thinkingall summer: the U.S. economic recovery and global interestrate differentials.   The expectation is that the dollar will trade between1.7300 marks and 1.7600 marks and 136.00 yen and 137.50 yentoday. Traders cautioned that since support levels didn'thold yesterday during the dollar's drop, they might proveequally unreliable during the next 24 hours. They added thatit might take a day or two for the dollar to sort itself out.   The sell-off that emerged was sharp because the marketdidn't expect Mr. Gorbachev to regain power, traders said.   Mr. Amendola noted that players had snapped up largequantities of dollars Monday, carrying the currency up 3.4%to a late New York quote at 1.8245 marks. The dollar peakedMonday at 1.8320 marks, not far from the 1991 high of 1.8427marks reached July 5.   But they took only modest profits by selling at higherlevels Tuesday, even though the &quot;coup flu&quot; suffered by twomembers of the take-over committee signaled a possiblereversal late Tuesday, said Mr. Lyman. Some participants werethinking that a strongman would emerge and take charge of theSoviet Union, Mr. Lyman said. &quot;Once it became clear that the{plotters} were backing down, the dollar collapsed,&quot; he said.   Many participants were &quot;still long and looking for dollarto go higher,&quot; when the coup began to come apart lateTuesday, Mr. Amendola said.   The U.S. currency began its nosedive late in the Asianmorning as several Singapore speculators dumped dollars onrumors that the coup had failed.   Bank Negara, the Malaysian central bank, was said to havejoined in the selling, mimicking a similar move reportedTuesday. Officials at the central bank declined to comment.   But during the North American morning, the dollar pausedfor about two hours and traded steadily around 1.7650 marks,in line with Friday's late New York quote. Once it fell under1.7650 marks, 12:30 p.m. EDT, the dollar headed for itsintraday lows as U.S. President George Bush announced that hehad re-established contact with Mr. Gorbachev and that theSoviet leader had said he was back in power.   The selling rapidly gained momentum, said Benoit Jadoul, avice president at Chase Manhattan Bank in New York. &quot;None ofthe support levels that the chartists had depended on held,&quot;he added.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $356.90 an ounce, up $1. Estimated volumewas a moderate 2.5 million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was trading at $357.20an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
