Based on a review of news items, journal articles,and conversations with state ocean policymakers, it appears that fewstates have actually made full-fledged efforts to grapple with marinepolicy issues raised by federal activities. Posing the issue in termsof federal/state relations, however, obscures another important change,namely the development of state institutions for dealing with marineissues.
