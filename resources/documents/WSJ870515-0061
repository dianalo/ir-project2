The majority of Salvadorans aren't expected to qualify for the new law's legalization program because they came to the U.S. after the Jan. 1, 1982, cutoff date. Nearly a million Salvadorans, or nearly one-fifth of the war-torn Latin nation's population, are estimated to live in the U.S., principally in Los Angeles, Houston and New York.    President Duarte recently wrote President Reagan requesting temporary refuge for Salvadoran nationals. He said his country's damaged economy couldn't absorb a flood of returning workers, and that El Salvador desperately needed the nearly $350 million to $600 million in remittances that the immigrants send home to family members annually. &quot;To eliminate remittances would be another blow that seems counterproductive to our joint aims of denying Central America to Marxist-Leninist regimes,&quot; President Duarte wrote in his letter.    The State Department said it gave President Duarte's request &quot;the most serious consideration,&quot; but that granting an exemption would set a precedent other countries would also want. The State Department said, however, that it will continue &quot;to monitor the effects of this legislation.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
