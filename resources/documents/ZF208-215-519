(graph)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The Allure Of UNIXandM;Mike Prince is sure his company's decision to go with a UNIX-basedinformation system strategy is saving a lot of money.andP;  Just don't ask him howmuch.andM;Prince is based in Lebanon, N.H., as vice president of information systemsfor the Burlington Coat Factory.andP;  After running its distribution system for acouple of years on a UNIX system, the $700 million clothing retailer hasdecided to convert its back office financial applications to UNIX and throwout a proprietary mainframe.andP;  If Burlington's past experience is anyindication, Prince says, the New York City-based firm will save a bundle onhardware.andM;&quot;The price/performance savings are significant,&quot; he says.andP;  &quot;What costs $3million in a proprietary environment like IBM you can get for $500,000 on aUNIX machine.&quot;andP;  So, based in part on what looks like a significant costsavings, Burlington is planning to replace a Honeywell Inc. mainframe with amultiprocessor UNIX-based system made by Sequent Computer Systems Inc. ofBeaverton, Ore.andM;The UNIX TheoryandM;Burlington Coat isn't the only large IS shop to have been attracted to UNIXby the idea that it is blazing a trail to lower IS costs.andP;  Competing UNIXversions notwithstanding, the alluring theory is that UNIX liberates usersfrom costly proprietary hardware architectures by providing improvedconnectivity and minimizing the cost and number of future softwareconversions.andM;UNIX advocates contend that, as standards such as UNIX make applications moreportable between disparate systems, vendors will have to compete by drivingUNIX's already exceptional hardware prices down further and expanding itsperformance via new technologies, such as reduced instruction set computing(RISC).andP;  &quot;UNIX increases the level of competition among vendors, and thatgives an edge to us,&quot; says Prince.andM;Even with today's attractive UNIX hardware costs, however, definitive proofthat UNIX means long-term savings has been elusive, as have cost evaluationmodels that might elicit that proof.andM;Users about to adopt UNIX without cost evaluations should consider some ofthe risks.andP;  While it has not been proven that UNIX's administrative costs arehigher than the up-front investment in UNIX hardware and software, expertspoint out that those costs in the proprietary environment often end up beinghigher.andP;  At the very least, those costs in the UNIX world could narrow thebargain margin.andM;Furthermore, one recent cost-of-ownership study by the Stamford, Conn.-basedmarket research firm Gartner Group suggests that users buying cheaper UNIXsystems may not be getting the functionality of their pricier, proprietarycousins (see chart, &quot;You Get What You Pay For&quot;).andP;  Other studies suggest thatUNIX cost benefits are greatest only for certain types of applications ratherthan for across-the-board UNIX implementations (see sidebar, &quot;When UNIXSystems Are Most Attractive&quot;).andM;Burlington's Prince admits that the company hasn't bothered to step back andcalculate the less obvious long-term economics of moving in a wholesalefashion to a UNIX environment.andM;Like Prince, Ellen Gordon, president of candy manufacturer Tootsie RollIndustries Inc. of Chicago, also is intuitively convinced of the long-termeconomies of UNIX.andP;  She bases that opinion largely on the fact that the VAXupgrade from Digital Equipment Corp. that the company needed to run anexpanding ORACLE database would have cost five times more than did a new UNIXsystem.andP;  Gordon converted most of her IS operations to a UNIX system withouta detailed estimate of the conversion costs or the long-term economics ofoperating in a UNIX, rather than a VAX VMS, environment.andM;Long-Term CostsandM;For proprietary systems, those long-term administrative costs, such astraining, and data and information management, historically have been foundto far outdistance up-front hardware and software expenses, says DonTapscott, managing director in Toronto of emerging technologies consultingfor DMR Group Inc., based in Montreal.andP;  What will it cost users to portexisting applications to a UNIX operating system, for example?andP;  What aboutretraining programmers and users, restructuring data and operating in a UNIXenvironment in which many key administrative tools are still in short supply?andM;Many observers believe that these administrative costs could well cancel outcost savings of the UNIX environment.andP;  &quot;Since the UNIX systems software is somuch less mature [than proprietary software], it's possible that, at thispoint, the economics could turn out to be a wash [compared with proprietarysystems],&quot; says David Card, senior analyst for the UNIX program atInternational Data Corp. in Framingham, Mass.andP;  Part of the reason, accordingto IDC's Card and others, is that the tools to assist in converting to UNIXand for monitoring and tuning system performance are just becoming available.andM;To date, UNIX system advocates, such as UNIX vendors and the open systemsconsortium X/Open Co. Ltd., have not developed the detailed models needed toallow users to predict the cost/benefits of moving to UNIX compared withtaking a more proprietary approach.andM;In fact, some UNIX advocates argue that the cost advantages of UNIX are sointuitively obvious that documenting them would be a waste of time.andP;  &quot;It'sjust so overwhelmingly obvious that UNIX is stimulating lower prices andtechnical innovation that most people haven't put a lot of effort intoproving it.andP;  The anecdotal evidence is everywhere,&quot; says Nina Lytton, editorof the &quot;Open Systems Advisor&quot; newsletter in Boston.andM;Adds Fred Meier, a vice president at UNIX vendor Unisys Corp., most users whounderstand the theory of open systems don't push for proof of lower long-termcosts.andP;  &quot;Usually those who do ask those kinds of questions are people whodon't want to go to UNIX in the first place.andP;  They're just looking for somekind of excuse not to go.&quot;andM;Users who perform their own cost studies may find that some of the savingspromised by UNIX advocates have yet to materialize.andP;  For example, very fewinexpensive software packages are available for UNIX systems, vendors say,because no single binary software interface has been widely accepted.andO;According to Jim Geers, president of AIM Technology, a maker of UNIX systemtuning and administration software, independent software vendors (ISVs) mustdevelop and market different versions of their applications for differentUNIX systems.andP;  Consequently, they must charge users much more than if therewere only one UNIX system.andP;  &quot;Right now we charge several thousand dollars foreach of our packages, but if there were a standard UNIX platform, that wouldbe only several hundred dollars for the same software,&quot; Geers says.andM;Apparently, plenty of commercial users are willing to buy UNIX systems atexisting prices, however.andP;  The Cupertino, Calif.-based market research firmInfoCorp./Gartner Group estimates that total value of midrange UNIX-basedsystems has grown from $451 million in 1983 to $3.91 billion in 1988.andP;  Theyproject $5.57 billion worth of midrange UNIX equipment will be sold by 1993.andO;The market for large UNIX systems is expected to grow modestly from $1.2billion in 1988 to $1.8 billion in 1993.andM;Not all large users are ready to jumP at UNIX just because the environmentseems to offer lower hardware prices and software development costs, however.andO;Selling UNIX for new departmental applications or to bold early adopters isone thing.andP;  But, say observers, convincing conservative MIS executives toconvert from their installed proprietary systems will be quite another.andO;Those users will increasingly demand the kind of detailed cost-of-ownershipstudies that so far haven't been done for UNIX, analysts say.andM;&quot;Most commercial UNIX users to date are medium-sized companies or departmentsreplacing a decaying technology base or starting new applications,&quot; saysDMR's Tapscott.andP;  And preliminary results of a study under way a McKinsey andamp;Co. Inc. indicate that UNIX makes the best economic sense for those kinds ofusers (see sidebar, &quot;When UNIX Systems Are Most Attractive&quot;).andM;Chemicals giant E.I.andP;  du Pont de Nemours andamp; Co. Inc., for instance, recentlydecided to proceed with several UNIX pilot projects across its $30 billionenterprise rather than undertake a large-scale, comprehensive conversion.andO;&quot;We believe we'll be on a different price/performance curve with UNIXhardware and software.andP;  But we're also going to be looking very hard atmaintenance, development, training costs, etc.andP;  We'd have to have a lot moreof that information before moving any core applications,&quot; says DuPont seniorconsultant Frank Peter.andM;On the recommendation of a six-person study group, Wilmington, Del.-basedDuPont has set up the pilot projects to determine the costs of and savingsfrom using UNIX as a tool to make its diverse systems interoperable.andP;  Itssystems come from Apple Computer Inc., Digital, Hewlett-Packard Co. and IBM,among others.andP;  &quot;The seductive attraction about UNIX is that it can get us aleg up on the interoperability problem,&quot; says Peter.andM;Other users, such as New York City-based insurance giant Metropolitan Life andamp;Affiliated Cos., which has had successful experiences with UNIX in nicheapplications, also are dubious about undertaking a broad conversion to UNIX(see sidebar, &quot;When UNIX Systems Are Most Attractive&quot;).andM;Easing Conversion DoubtsandM;To help ease conversion doubts, several consulting groups and one large UNIXuser organization are beginning to put together detailed cost/benefit modelsto allow users to analyze the true economies of UNIX.andP;  One such recentlyannounced effort is a $1.5 million joint venture between the DMR Group andthe 6,000-member UNIX users' association, /usr/group, headquartered in SantaClara.andM;According to Ed Palmer, / usr / group executive director, &quot;Our idea is to doa more analytical study of the benefits of UNIX....andP;  We want to get beyondthe success stories and really let users know what it will cost them to getinvolved in UNIX and what the payoffs are.andP;  in the past, the whole industryhas been somewhat guilty of using smoke and mirrors.&quot;andM;Participants in the study already include key organizations such as X/Open,The Open Software Foundation and UNIX International Inc., as well as vendorssuch as ATandamp;T, Data General Corp., IBM, NCR Corp., Prime Computer Inc., Unisysand Wang Laboratories Inc.andM;Early results of the study show that 65% of the organizations using UNIX relyon it for less than 10% of their IS activity.andP;  But, says Tapscott, that ischanging.andP;  &quot;As the industry matures, more and more corporations will betrying to make a generic case of open systems and UNIX.andP;  Those people want toknow what the economic opportunities are, and right now there's a big gap inthe information that's available.&quot;andM;A recent cost-of-ownership study conducted by The Sierra Group of Tempe,Ariz.--which for the first time included UNIX equipment, such as IBM's AIXand HP's UX, along with proprietary systems like IBM's AS/400--concluded thatUNIX-based systems are between 30 and 50% less expensive than proprietarysystems.andP;  But the Sierra study included only hardware and software puchases,licensing fees, contract support and maintenance costs.andP;  It did not touch onother costs, such as those associated with conversion, retraining and ongoingapplication development and administration.andP;  Those back-end costs, oncefactored in, could narrow the cost savings.andM;For many users, of course, the potential of lower costs is not the mostimportant factor in a decision to go with a UNIX systems approach.andP;  Forcompanies such as the 23-property hotel chain Four Seasons Hotels and ResortsLtd., replacing proprietary turnkey systems with UNIX-based systems from HPmade sense, but not so much because of promised cost reductions.andP;  Rather, theToronto-based company was attracted to UNIX because it scalable architectureand open connectivity features best supported the company's distributedbusiness.andP;  Also, most of the key software packages for hotel managementalready had been ported to UNIX.andM;Other UNIX BenefitsandM;In fact, according to IS manager Geoffrey K. McDowell, four Seasons figuredthat replacing its older turnkey systems with $6 million worth of HP UNIXhardware, software and services was a wash from a cost point of view.andP;  Butreplacing the collection of incompatible older systems with a singleintegrated UNIX environment had other benefits.andM;&quot;Now we can record reservations, collect charges, do statistical analysis andmarketing all from the same database,&quot; says McDowell.andP;  In addition, McDowellsays, the move bought the company a degree of future security by eliminatingits reliance on value-added resellers and ISVs who might decide to stopwriting software for or supporting certain pieces of hardware.andM;&quot;We looked at cost, but it really wasn't the most important thing,&quot; saysMcDowell.andP;  &quot;There are plenty of other good reasons to go to UNIX.andP;  Thevendors would be smart to emphasize those and not focus so much on cost.&quot;andM;DuPont's Peter concurs, even though his study group has no detailedcost/benefit analysis to tell him what a UNIX conversion could cost.andP;  &quot;Thereare functional benefits to open [UNIX] systems that go beyond cost savings.andO;It's something we would be willing to pay for.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
