When each town in New England had a common field where cows werefree to graze, more and more farmers would bring their animals,until, finally, not enough grass was left for anyone.   Today's commercial fishermen ply New England waters inmillion-dollar boats with fish-finding sonar devices. But they arein essentially the same position as 18th century farmers squabblingover fodder.   With demand for fish rising and no restriction on the number ofU.S. fishing boats, the New England fleet has grown so fast that itis quickly depleting the stocks of haddock, cod and other staplespecies, fishermen and scientists say.   ``I'm a skipper and a boat owner, I've got a mortgage and afamily to support, and it's getting real scary,'' said John Raymondof South Berwick, Maine, as he stood on a Boston pier earlier thisyear with a spike in his hand, unloading 22,000 pounds of fishafter eight days at sea.   Raymond, 38, said he and his three crewmen on the 86-foottrawler Olympia are staying at sea longer and fishing moreaggressively _ often hauling nets through the night _ but theircatch is declining.   ``Seven or eight years ago, I would get 60, 70, maybe 80,000pounds every trip,'' he said. ``Now, I'm lucky to get 20,000.''   He is not alone. All along the coast from Portland, Maine, toProvidence, R.I., fishermen are finding fewer haddock, cod,flounder and redfish, the bottom-feeding groundfish that providethe flaky, white, mild-flavored fillets that Americans consumersprefer.   ``The stocks of these species are at all-time lows, and it'stouch-and-go whether they'll ever fully come back,'' said StephenH. Clark, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service inWoods Hole.   ``Unless something is done to reduce the (fish) mortality rate,the probability is that yields will continue to decline, and therisk that these stocks will never recover is going to increase.''   The declining number of fish is causing turmoil throughout theNew England fishing industry, which has deep historical roots inmany communities, generated $493 million in wholesale revenues lastyear and employs more than 15,000 full-time fishermen and 10,000processors and wholesalers.   Among the signs of frustration and dissension, according tofisherman and regulators:   _Incursions by American trawlers into richer Canadian waters,leading to chases by Canadian patrol boats and, in one recent case,to warning shots being fired over the bow of an American vessel.   _A flourishing black market in undersized scallops, illegalfishing in spawning areas and allegations that some trawlers carrynets with illegally tight mesh.   _Bitter rivalries between groups of fishermen using differenttypes of gear and operating out of competing ports.   _Rising prices for consumers and concern among both fishermenand wholesale buyers over the fairness of fish auctions in majorports, particularly Boston.   Ironically, Clark and many other experts date the problem to theextension of the U.S. territorial limit from 12 to 200 miles in1977-78.   While the 200-mile limit reduced competition from foreignvessels, it also prompted a rapid buildup of the U.S. fleet, notonly in the number of vessels, but also in their size andsophistication, said Buell Hollister, an information officer forthe Massachusetts Division of Marine Fisheries.   ``When the 200-mile limit was created, it was a highlypublicized event and it really got a lot of people interested inthe industry,'' Hollister said. ``Investment capital came pouringinto the American fleet, and it coincided with a tremendousrevolution in electronic technology, which really refined thefish-catching effectiveness of the trawlers.''   Among the new devices are sensitive sonar systems with colordisplays that can identify the location, direction and species ofschools of fish deep below the surface.   Also, satellite navigation systems now allow trawler captains topinpoint their position with such accuracy that they can leave netsin the water, then return and find them later.   The over-fishing problem has been compounded by a 1984 WorldCourt decision that gave Canada control over thousands of squaremiles of disputed territory in the fertile Georges Bank and Gulf ofMaine fishing grounds. That has forced the New England fleet into asmaller area, making competition even more intense.   Smaller, less sophisticated fishing operations are quickly beingedged out as the bigger ones grow. New England's offshore fleet nowincludes about 1,400 vessels weighing 5 tons or more, more thandouble the number in the 1970s.   ``Without question, the New England groundfish industry istotally overcapitalized,'' said David S. Crestin, deputy directorof the federal Office of Fishery Conservation and Management inWashington.   The species that has been most devastated is haddock. Landingsof haddock from New England waters are less than a tenth of thelevel that prevailed from 1935 to 1960, despite more intensivefishing.   Even more significant than the size of the catch, however, isthe ``spawning biomass'' _ the total weight of all the fish matureenough to reproduce _ because that determines the viability of thespecies.   Until the 1960s, the spawning biomass of haddock in New Englandwaters was about 120,000 metric tons. Now, it's less than 20,000,the National Fisheries Service says.   The decline has been nearly as dramatic for cod, whose spawningstocks on Georges Bank have fallen by two-thirds in less than adecade.   An attempt in the late 1970s to limit the fish harvest byimposing quotas on fishermen led to widespread cheating and hasbeen abandoned by the New England Fishery Management Council, theboard that regulates the industry.   In recent years, the council has repeatedly discussed thepossibility of limiting the size of the fleet, as Canada does. Butthe discussions have foundered every time on ``don't gore my ox''objections, said the council's chairman, James L. Warren of Brewer,Maine.   ``You can get general agreement that there ought to be some sortof control on the amount of (fishing) effort,'' Warren said. ``Butwhen you get down to the specific details is where you run intoproblems, because Joe Blow says, `Well, what if my son decides tofollow me in the business?' or `What if I want to buy anotherboat?'''   Other proposals that have been discussed include shutting downthe groundfish fleet for a year to allow the fish population toregenerate, or aggressively marketing species that are stillplentiful, such as herring and mackerel.   Some fishermen said they believe a shake-out is inevitable.   ``A lot of guys are going to go broke,'' predicted JimmyBramante of Boston as he prepared to take his 88-foot Captain SamII out to Georges Bank. ``The way it's going, how much more can thefish stocks take?''</TEXT><NOTE>End adv Monday AMs Nov. 27</NOTE></DOC>
