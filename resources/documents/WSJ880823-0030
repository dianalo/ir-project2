The vice president edged out Democratic candidates among people age 18 to 22 in polls taken early in the campaign, Mr. Benson says, and will likely hold on to that support come November, despite some seesawing after each party's national convention. But several factors point to a considerable number of youth votes for Michael Dukakis as well.    Mr. Reagan's -- and therefore, Mr. Bush's -- popularity with these potential first-time voters who make up 10% of the electorate seems to have a lot less to do with political philosophy than it does with familiarity. Not even a growing social liberalism among them negates the fact that Ronald Reagan has been president since the oldest of these voters was only 14 and just beginning to become politically conscious.    &quot;He's the only president they've ever known,&quot; says Nancy Zingale, a political science professor at the College of Saint Thomas in St. Paul, Minn., and co-author of a text on the behavior of American voters. &quot;When young people were asked who have been the two greatest presidents, the most popular responses were Kennedy and Reagan,&quot; Ms. Zingale adds.    So, since they can't vote for Mr. Reagan, many young voters seem to think the next best thing is voting for Mr. Bush. Indeed, so strong is Mr. Reagan's popularity, some first-time voters are voting Republican despite Mr. Bush's candidacy and his choice of Sen. Dan Quayle of Indiana as a running mate.    &quot;I don't think (Bush) is, as a person, the optimum candidate, but the Republican party is more in line with my beliefs,&quot; says Mike Cooper, a 22-year-old finance and management major at the University of Cincinnati in Ohio. He says he plans to vote for the vice president because Mr. Bush is a Republican, but he credits President Reagan with making the Republican party &quot;more visible.&quot;    There are, of course, some non-Reagan reasons young voters seem inclined to favor Mr. Bush. According to a survey of 300,000 college freshmen, the &quot;greed factor&quot; is skyrocketing among young Americans. Determined by the number of positive responses to a cluster of questions on money, a high greed factor overwhelmingly indicates fiscal conservatism, a hallmark of Republican voters and administrations. Alexander Astin, originator of the 22-year-old survey and director of the University of California's Higher Education Research Institute in Los Angeles, says the greed factor was not only higher than ever last year, but also cut across every demographic distinction.    But it would be unwise of Mr. Bush to count on 18 million votes from this age group. Fewer than half of the newly eligible voters actually cast ballots in the 1984 election, a lower voter turnout than the general populace. Also, some researchers say, the brouhaha over Sen. Quayle's military record could cost the Republican ticket some votes among first-time voters. Even though young voters don't remember much about the Vietnam War era, the Quayle controversy could escalate enough to cast a shadow.    And, paradoxically, a growing number of 18-to-22-year-olds who embrace financial conservatism have increasingly liberal social attitudes; these are the children of the &quot;flower children&quot; of the 1960s, and their attitudes to some degree reflect the influence of their parents' experience. Add to that the Rev. Jesse Jackson's ability to galvanize young liberal voters, and it could mean that a significant number of young voters who do turn out will vote for Gov. Dukakis.    Detra Hubert, an 18-year-old liberal arts freshman at the University of Houston, says she has seen what the Reagan administration has done and is ready for a change. &quot;I think Dukakis is great. I like some of his ideas and we need to give the Democrats a chance to see what they can do.&quot;    Mr. Astin of UCLA says college freshmen in his survey support liberal ideas such as school busing and abortion rights at record levels. Support for big defense budgets, a conservative gauge, is at a record low. Richard Flacks, a sociology professor at the University of California at Santa Barbara, says, &quot;The new voter is meeting a fairly liberal student body, and that can make a difference.&quot;    It certainly did with John Foster. A senior majoring in economics, Mr. Foster says he didn't concern himself much with politics before he arrived at Harvard University in Cambridge, Mass. His political education has come mostly from his friends. &quot;The majority of my peers tend to have liberal views, and to some extent that has influenced my thinking,&quot; he says. Gov. Dukakis's platform has won his vote, although he concedes he may have some regional bias toward the Massachusetts governor.    The tendency toward more liberal social views also is true of non-students in the age group, says Toba Spitzer, director of Youth Action, a Washington, D.C.-based organization devoted to encouraging youth activism. But Ms. Spitzer says college students traditionally have a much higher turnout rate than do others in that age group.    No matter how, or whether, young voters cast their ballots in November, it's no harbinger of what they'll do as they age. Ms. Spitzer says as many as 40% of first-time voters in the 18-to-22 age bracket are registered as independents, eschewing a firm affiliation with either party. That statistic suggests that even they are aware their political views are still not fully formed. Adds the Roper Center's Mr. Benson: &quot;They have less life experience, so they haven't developed the same range of concerns as older voters.&quot;    ---                   1986 Registered Voters                   18 to 22 Years Old                                  REGISTERED TO VOTE        AGE        TOTAL          ------------------        GROUP      NUMBER         NUMBER        PCT.         18        3,646,000      1,006,000     27%         19        3,445,000      1,165,000     33         20        3,649,000      1,629,000     44         21        3,672,000      1,745,000     47         22        3,938,000      1,872,000     47   Source: U.S. Census Bureau</TEXT></DOC>
