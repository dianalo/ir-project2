 Bit bybit, however, telecommunications is opening the path toward the vision ofXanadu espoused by hypertext pioneer Ted Nelson and others: an on-line,distributed network that serves as a repository for the world's literature.andO;Yet the vision seems to shimmer just out of reach as its prophets strugglewith the limits of today's technology.andM;For computer users with modems, however, there is a world of hands-oninformation an ATDT-command away.andP;  And for Macintosh users, those fourletters are destined to go the way of the DOS prompt as moretelecommunications programs adopt graphical interfaces (see &quot;On-line costs,&quot;Page TK).andM;As on-line systems sport friendlier interfaces, electronic publishers arebecoming more venturesome.andP;  In contrast to past practices of emphasizingbibliographic databases and abstracts, &quot;The trend has been to get full texton-line,&quot; said Jeff Pemberton, president of Online Inc. of Weston, Conn.,andO;publisher of the Buyers Guide to Microcomputer Software, which is availablevia the Palo Alto, Calif.-based Dialog on-line service.andM;In addition, there are more electronic-only publications.andP;  Besides the majorwire services and the 55 Investext industry reports of 6,000 publicly tradedcompanies, there are resources like NewsNet of Bryn Mawr, Pa., which sportselectronic-only newsletters such as the Latin American Debt Chronicle,Central America Today and seven English-language Japanese publications.andM;What goes on-line best?andP;  The types of information that lend themselves toon-line publishing are directories and databases that require frequentupdating, such as Dayton, Ohio-based Mead Data Central's Lexis law database,and services that involve transactions, such as hotel and airline reservationsystems.andP;  &quot;There's a constituency that is willing to pay for the informationbecause what they're getting is access to large databases, they're getting itheavily current and they're getting it instantaneously,&quot; said JonathanSeybold, publisher of the Seybold reports on desktop publishing and desktoppublishing systems.andM;Despite the advantages of frequent updates and the appearance of full text,however, on-line publications don't &quot;substitute for print distribution,because of all the graphics involved,&quot; Pemberton explained.andP;  Even thoughinterfaces may take the sting out of getting on-line, and in some cases mayeven help you navigate the initial menus, you're nevertheless &quot;dealing with aheterogeneous environment where the Mac is forced to operate at the lowestcommon denominator, which is basically a character-mode [IBM] PC[compatible],&quot;  Seybold said.andM;What barriers to graphics?andP;  Obstacles to putting graphics on-line are bothobvious and subtle.andP;  Slow speeds and the lack of standards are two of themost apparent impediments, and they are not unrelated.andM;Anyone who has downloaded a graphics file knows that the wait can beinterminable, and with on-line information, time is money.andP;  &quot;When we'retalking graphics, we're talking bandwidth,&quot; Pemberton said.andP;  One proposedsolution is now before Congress in the form of the High-Performance ComputerTechnology bill sponsored by Sen.andP;  Albert Gore, D-Tenn., which seeks fundingto build an infrastructure of data superhighways, probably based onIntegrated Services Digital Network technology.andM;According to Seybold, speed is a necessary but not sufficient answer to theproblem of on-line graphics.andP;  Because it relies on advertising revenues andemploys graphics in its on-line ads as well as in its other services, theconsumer-oriented Prodigy, based in White Plains, N.Y., uses NAPLPS (NorthAmerican Presentation Level Protocol Syntax), a videotext standard, tocommunicate graphics primitives, according to Jim Galambos, Prodigy directorof service design and quality.andP;  The graphics available on IBM PCs, PCcompatibles and Macs are, however, of the low-resolution variety.andP;  Standardsthat support transfer of electronic documents from one media to another, suchas SGML (Standard Graphical Markup Language), are needed before electronicpages can replace streams of text.andP;  &quot;What we need is not merely a system thatdelivers electronically what is available in print, but we need somethingthat facilitates the creation of transportable electronic files,&quot; saidCzeslaw Grycz, director of the Scholarship and Technology Study Project atthe University of California's Division of Library Automation, located inOakland, Calif.andP;  Because of the difficulty in creating SGML-compliant files,Grycz envisions a &quot;scholar's toolbox&quot; that would automate much of the task --an expert system that could parse a document and tag the appropriate heads,footnotes and other attributes so that both a document's display andstructural attributes travel with it to the screen.andM;&quot;Standards are always a moving target,&quot; said Norman Meyrowitz, associatedirector of the Institute for Research in Information and Scholarship atBrown University in Providence, R.I., where the Intermedia hypertext programfor A/UX was developed.andP;  &quot;Three years ago there wasn't a TIFF, there wasn'tPICT2,&quot; Meyrowitz added.andP;  &quot;Now those things are standard.&quot;andM;But will the standards travel?andP;  Screen resolution, font technology and colorare some of the subtler issues facing on-line graphical communications.andP;  Forthe present, Adobe Type Manager offers Mac users relief from the jaggies, andthe Royal technology forthcoming from Apple and endorsed by Microsoft has themakings of yet another standard that could pave the way for the appearance ofmultiple fonts on-line.andP;  But the resolution problem doesn't stop there.andO;Grycz conjures up editions of the Talmud that employ marginal glosses in6-point type and background tints for subsidiary information to illustratethe gulf that exists today between print and electronic media.andM;Color is yet another aspect that does not translate all that well to theelectronic book.andP;  It's the reverse of the familiar problem of maintainingcalibration when going from screen to paper.andP;  &quot;The same color you use inprint, if you use the same Pantone colors on the screen, those colors won'tbe as readable,&quot; Meyrowitz said.andM;What do you need to download?andP;  Differences in what applications are availableon individual desktops also pose a serious technical challenge to integratorsof on-line systems.andP;  One proposed solution is to embed encapsulated programsin the files themselves, so that &quot;the network can pass along a driver to meetthe needs of your equipment,&quot; Grycz said.andP;  The result, however, may be one ofprotocol glut.andM;For all their look and feel, the alternatives presented by proprietaryservices, such as the recently introduced Mac-based America On-line fromQuantum Computer Services Inc. of Vienna, Va., and Cupertino, Calif.-basedConnect Inc.'s older Connect is even less compelling from a publisher'sperspective.andP;  &quot;If you presume that someone has to have an XYZ computer todial these things up, you are very much constraining your marketplace,&quot;Seybold said.andP;  &quot;Whatever you put up there has to be accessible from whatevercomputer the person who's doing it chooses to use.&quot;andM;Yet the demand is there.andP;  The demand for on-line graphics has spawnedalternative methods of delivering documents, notably by fax.andP;  You can performa bibliographic search on-line and then ask that the full text be printed outand faxed to you from the remote location.andP;  &quot;A fax gives the opportunity fora document delivery tool for a very cheap price everywhere, something thatcan deliver graphics,&quot; said Barbara Quint, editor of the on-line publicationDatabase Searcher, based in Westport, Conn.andP;  Almost by default, CD-ROM hasbecome the electronic publishing platform of choice, with many titlesaccessible for on-line preview through the Bureau of Electronic Publishingbased in Parsippany, N.J.andP;  The CD-ROM version of Grolier's New ElectronicEncyclopedia, long a standard on-line reference, although entirelytext-based, does support hypertext-like cross-referencing.andM;Ultimately, Seybold foresees a richer mixture of tools -- exclusivelyon-line, on-line with print, fax and CD-ROM -- emerging to replace text-onlysystems, he said.andP;  &quot;The world we are aiming toward is one in which we have awhole repertoire of forms, and the trick is to use those tools or thosecombinations of tools that are appropriate to the task at hand.&quot;andM;Futurology?andP;  But the real promise of on-line publishing lies in the originalvision of hypertext: the ability to link related pieces of information in anassociative trail that mimics &quot;non-linear&quot; human thought processes.andM;Although Grycz said he believes that print still has the edge in generating&quot;more information per square inch,&quot; the dynamic interchange of informationmade possible by interprocess communication could change all that.andP;  On-linehypertext requires not only new technology but new ways of publishing,whether it is automating text-to-hypertext translation or tracking royaltiesand copyrights electronically.andP;  According to Grycz, &quot;In order to havehyperlinks to texts and to subsets of texts, the first necessary component isaddressability.&quot; This means that a document has to reside somewherepermanently in order for anyone to find it.andP;  Such a requirement, Grycz feels,will ensure editors and publishers employment into the 21st century and evenusher in new institutions peopled with on-line distributors and informa-tionmiddlemen.andP;  &quot;It may well be,&quot; he said, &quot;that everyone does their own littleself-publishing, but from time to time a librarian or an official publishersays, 'I'm going to grab this in this state and I'm going to archive it.' Atthat point we can start making hyper-text links.&quot;andM;Self-publishing is precisely what hypertext prophet and AutoDesk fellowNelson had in mind when he envisioned a network of Public Access Xanadu (PAX)franchises -- &quot;Star Trek McDonald's,&quot; he calls them -- and a million users bythe year 2000.andP;  To that end, the Xanadu Operating Co. of Palo Alto, Calif.,andO;is preparing the first Xanadu back-end software (for Sun workstations -- PCand Mac versions will follow) that will provide an organizational path tosupport such forms as electronic Post-it notes and video clips.andM;Just how will publishing change?andP;  The desktop revolution is changing the waypeople publish, and it is bound to alter people's concept of what apublication is.andP;  Most observers agree that on-line publishing will grow toinclude images, sound and video.andM;&quot;The thing that makes this possible is that increasingly we're moving towarda world in which information is all in digital form, meaning that it isindependent of any particular medium and you can transmit it, you can put itinto whatever form you need to at the appropriate time,&quot; Seybold said.andM;Cable's broadband technology invites speculation on the multimediapossibilities of combining on-line information with video.andP;  &quot;We see themelding of two or three different technologies as a potential market,&quot; saidBill Steele, president of San Jose, Calif.-based Network Resources Corp., avendor of Mac broadband communications equipment.andP;  But at this point there islittle interest from cable companies in supporting data communications,according to Steele.andP;  &quot;I'm cautiously optimistic, but it's not something thatis a wave,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;It's a potential.&quot; In addition, more applications thatsupport video on the Mac have to be in place before broadband hypermediaapplications can fulfill that potential.andM;Meanwhile, integrating telecommunications interfaces as navigational aidswith electronically stored information is the key to transforming on-linepublishing into a viable market.andP;  Electronic media may never completelyreplace print, but it is clear that for those who demand the latest, mostup-to-date information, there is no reasonable substitute.andP;  And whilecomputer technology has to date mostly served print communications, thepossibilities afforded by on-line hypertext and multimedia foreshadowentirely new communications media.andM;David Bunnell, who published the first magazine devoted to personalcomputers, is now pioneering electronic publishing with a unique servicecalled Bioworld, an on-line daily newspaper devoted exclusively tobiotechnology.andM;By developing an electronic-only vertical market publication, Bunnell hopesto provide what he calls &quot;a one-stop shopping mall for biotech information.&quot;andM;Part news wire service, bulletin board, messaging system and database, SanMateo, Calif.--based Bioworld offers computer-shy biotech researchers andbusinesspeople a full menu of news, a weekly feature and specialpublications, such as the National Institute of Health's proposed guidelinesfor genetic research.andP;  Also available on the system is the Bioscan databasefrom Oryx Press of Phoenix, Ariz., a directory of 900 biotech firmsworldwide.andP;  In addition, Bioworld maintains its own database of financialinformation on 80 biotech companies in a Microsoft Excel format for easydownloading and analysis.andM;The service is a private partition on Cupertino, Calif.--based Connect Inc.'sConnect Business Information Network, and sports its own Macintosh interface.andO;&quot;Instead of getting on a much bigger system and going through a lot of menusto get to Bioworld, you get on and you're in this world of information aboutbiotechnology,&quot; said Bunnell, who claims that each day's news is theequivalent of an edition of the Wall Street Journal.andM;&quot;It's the Mac interface that makes it easy to use, easy to understand,&quot; headded.andP;  &quot;Biotechnology people have computers, but they're not reallysuperliterate in computers.andP;  They just want to use computers to accessinformation or to do productivity [tasks].&quot;andM;Launched last September, Bioworld arose out of Bunnell and publicationdirector Cliff Barney's long-term interests in on-line publishing.andP;  But thefield of on-line services for computer enthusiasts was already overcrowded,so they approached Cynthia Robbins-Roth, a former genetic research scientistand consultant who is now a newsletter editor.andP;  She was intrigued with theirproposal for uploading her monthly Bioventure Views newsletter and turning itinto a daily.andP;  &quot;It wasn't a database, it was information, it was news andanalysis, and it fit really well with what I had been grappling with forabout a year,&quot; she said.andM;Bunnell shares her enthusiasm, if not her expertise, for the field.andO;Reflecting on his past as a computer maven, Bunnell said, &quot;The technology issimilar in the way that the DNA code is represented by four letters, ATGC(adenine, thymine, guanine and cytosine), and the computer code isrepresented by two numbers, 0 and 1.&quot;andM;Because it is not readily available in other forms, Bunnell said he believesthat people in the biotech industry are willing to pay for the kind of timelyinformation his service provides.andP;  &quot;Part of our philosophy was that youneeded to have some very vital information that changed every day, so thatpeople would have a compelling reason to get on the system,&quot; he said.andP;  Witheach issue archived electronically, as well as the availability of databases,&quot;Once you read something on the news, it could stimulate interest and youcould look elsewhere [in the system] to find background,&quot; he said.andP;  It isjust such a mix of services that makes Bunnell's venture into electronicpublishing unique, not only in the biotechnology industry but in the on-lineworld as well.andM;Bunnell said he could not afford to publish a daily newspaper for such asmall market, &quot;but when printing and distributing information is just amatter of posting it on a mainframe, we can afford to provide these 2,000people with the equivalent of a daily newspaper.&quot; -- By Richard RawlesandM;Although the new interfaces help reduce on-line costs, &quot;At $100 to $200 [perhour] access charges, it's like 'Beat the Clock,' &quot; said Steve McIntosh, aninformation broker in Santa Barbara, Calif., and developer of Microphonescripts for NewsNet and Dialog.andM;But the cost to the end user is only one side of the equation.andP;  From thepublisher's perspective, most of the revenues are siphoned off by theinformation carrier.andP;  The information provider sees a smaller portion of therevenue, making publishing on-line precarious.andP;  &quot;A print publication beginsto distribute on-line as a marginal source of revenue,&quot; said Jeff Pemberton,president of Online Inc. of Weston, Conn., a company whose Buyers Guide beganlife in the print world and now is electronic-only.andM;Although Barbara Quint, editor of Westport, Conn.-based Database Searcher,said the costs of &quot;migration&quot; from print to electronic media may result in aloss of print revenues, Pemberton cited the ability to update frequently asthe major incentive for abandoning print, a view shared by David Bunnell,president of I/O Publishing (see &quot;Going on-line for biotechnology info,&quot;
