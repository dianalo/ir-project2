Introduction</ITAG>On January 30, 1989, the Depository Trust Company (``DTC'') filed a proposedrule change (File No. SR-DTC-89-03) with the Commission pursuant to Section19(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (``Act'').\1\<NOTE/> The proposed rule change would establish as a full servicethe International Institutional Delivery (``IID'') System. The Commissionpublished notice of the proposed rule change in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on February 8, 1989.\2\<NOTE/> No comments were received. As discussed below, the Commissionis approving this proposed rule change.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Securities Exchange Act Release No 26505 (January 31,1989), 54 FR 6223.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Description</ITAG>The proposed rule change would establish as a full DTC service the InternationalInstitutional Delivery System for the centralized, automated processingof international, institutional trades. DTC has been operating the IIDSystem as a pilot program with limited participation since December 1988.\3\<NOTE/> Operation of the IID System as a full service is expectedto increase efficiency in settling many institutional trades executed inforeign securities \4\<NOTE/> by centralizing and automating the communication of tradedetails, confirmations, affirmations, and deliver and receive instructionsamong many parties to an international, institutional trade.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Approval of the pilot program was granted in SecuritiesExchange Act Release No. 26374 (December 20, 1988), 53 FR 52283.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ ``Foreign securities'' means non-U.S. and non-Canadiansecurities that are not eligible for automated book-entry settlement, andthat, for various reasons, <T3>e.g., </T3>lack of a compatible securities identification number, arenot conducive to processing in the domestic ID System.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ The IID System is an extension of DTC's domestic ID system,with certain differences. For example, IID accommodates the need to identifyforeign currencies and a variety of securities numbering systems that areused in different markets and international clearance and settlement systems.In addition, IID enables participants to identify foreign sub-custodianswho will effect delivery or receipt of securities and collection or paymentof related funds. Also, processing times differ for domestic and internationalinstitutional trades: IID is capable of same-day processing of participantinput and related DTC output. In the domestic system, participant inputand DTC output generally are processed over a minumum of three days. Anotherimportant difference is that domestic ID will continue to provide for automatedsettlement at a registered clearing agency, while IID enables parties tocommunicate deliver/receive instructions for settlement outside DTC, presumablybetween foreign sub-custodians.Generally, the IID System will process trade data input from broker-dealersat various cutoff times during the day.\6\<NOTE/> Certain fields contain mandatory data, such as identificationnumbers for all parties, International Standards Organization (``ISO'')currency codes, ISO security-type codes, and numbering system codes.\7\<NOTE/> Confirms are generated and available approximately one-halfhour after the cutoff time for trade data input.\8\<NOTE/> Confirms are sent to broker-dealers, agent banks/global custodians,and institutions. Confirms identify sub-custodians for both trading parties.Affirmation processing occurs throughout the day, from 8 a.m. until 7:30p.m. Affirmations are received from agent banks/global custodians and institutions.Affirmations may contain payment and settlement instructions for communicationamong institutions and agent banks/global custodians. Information abouterrors in affirmations is available about one-half hour after affirmationsare received. The IID System generates deliver and receive instructionsthroughout the day, about one-half hour after affirmations are processed.In addition, inquiry capability is available to broker-dealers, agent banks/globalcustodians, and institutions. A more complete description of the IID Systemmay be found in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26374.\9\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ Cutoff times for computer-to-computer (``CCF'') usersoccur at 10 a.m., 2 p.m., 6 p.m., and 2 a.m. Data from Participant TerminalSystem (``PTS'') users will be processed immediately.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The IID System is designed to accommodate any recognizedsecurities identification numbering system. The numbering system itselfmust be idetified in the IID System by using codes developed for this purpose.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ Confirms for trade data input after the 2 a.m. cutoffwill be available at 7 a.m.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ <T3>See </T3>note 3, <T3>supra.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">III. DTC''s Rationale</ITAG>In its filing, DTC stated that the purpose of the proposed rule changeis to provide information that is intended to increase efficiency in settlingmany international, institutional trades. DTC further stated that suchpurpose is consistent with the requirements of the Act and the rules andregulations thereunder applicable to DTC.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Discussion</ITAG>Section 17A of the Act sets forth the duties and requirements of registeredclearing agencies. Section 17A(b)(3)(F) of the Act provides that a clearingagency's rules must be designed, among other things, to promote the promptand accurate clearance and settlment of securities transactions, to assurethe safeguarding of securities and funds in the clearing agency's custodyor control, and to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engagedin the clearance and settlement of securities transactions.In recent years, the volume of international trading, including institutionaltrading, has increased significantly.\1\\0\<NOTE/> Moreover, international trading is complicated by the lackof uniformity in settlement procedures and time frames, and the involvementof a large number of geographically distant parties. The increased volumesand non-uniform practices make international trading complex and vulnerableto the risks of delays or failed settlements.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ For example, in 1987, purchases and sales comprisingforeign activity in U.S. corporate stocks totalled approximately $482 billion,compared with approximately $278 billion in 1986. Purchases and sales comprisingU.S. activity in foreign corporate stocks in 1987 totalled approximately$189 billion, compared with approximately $100 billion in 1986.The Commission believes that DTC's IID System has the potential to improvethe clearance and settlement of a significant number of international,institutional trades, thereby reducing the risks of cross-border trading.The IID System centralizes and automates communications among the variousentities involved in cross-border transactions. The IID System has thecapability of turning around, on a same-day basis, trade data input, confirmations,affirmations, and deliver and receive instructions, thereby enabling moretimely settlements. By providing deliver and receive instructions, theIID System also enables the parties to settle trades wherever they choose,in accordance with local settlement practices. Thus, the IID System potentiallywill promote the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of securitiestransactions by providing fast, efficient communications among the parties.Pursuant to temporary Commission approval, DTC has been operating the IIDSystem as a pilot program.\11\<NOTE/> DTC reports that, based on informal conversations with pilotprogram participants, no operational difficulties have been encountered,and the program has been running successfully. For the period from December27, 1988 to February 24, 1989, four institutions, four broker-dealers,and seven global custodians used the IID System. In addition, eighteensub-custodians were identified on confirms generated in the IDD System.Identified sub-custodians are located in Japan, the United Kingdom, WestGermany, Amsterdam, and Belgium. DTC reports that approximately 136 confirmationswere processed in the IID System during that period, resulting in settlementfor 83 affirmed trades. DTC believes that many more participants will useand enjoy the benefits of the IID System when it becomes available to themas a full service.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ Approval of the temporary pilot program has been extendedtwice, in Securities Exchange Act Release Nos. 26492 (January 26, 1989),54 FR 5184, and 26577 (February 28, 1989), 54 FR 9954.As noted in Securities Exchange Act Release No. 26374, the Commission specificallyapproves of DTC's decision to design the IID System to accommodate a varietyof securities identification numbering systems. The Commission believesthat, until an internationally recognized securities identification numberingsystem is developed and in use in major market centers, any service designedto enhance international clearance and settlement must account for themyriad numbering systems currently used in international trading centers.\12\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ Among other efforts, the board of trustees that governsthe CUSIP numbering system in the United States has approved developinga Cusip International Numbering System (``CINS''). CINS would consist ofnine digit symbol, an arrangement that is compatible with systems currentlyused by U.S. broker-dealers.The Commission urges DTC to consider future inclusion of sub-custodiansas direct participants in the IID System. Although the current IID Systemconfiguration permits identification of sub-custodians, sub-custodiansdo not receive any communications from the IID System. Instead, they receivenotification of settlements directly from agent banks/global custodians.Inclusion of sub-custodians in the IID System could further reduce therisk of delays in communications between agent banks/global custodiansand sub-custodians. According to DTC, the inclusion of sub-custodians isnot critical at this time, primarily because the broker-dealers and agentbanks/global custodians that requested the IID System and that are expectedto be the major users of IID already have communications networks and proceduresin place for transmitting deliver and receive instructions to sub-custodians.The Commission nevertheless urges DTC to be especially sensitive to anyrequests from participants to enhance the IID System to include sub-custodians.\13\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\13\ In Securities Exchange Act No. 26374, the Commissionalso noted that DTC intends to offer to CCF users the option of a standardizedISO format for deliver/receive instructions for sub-custodians. The Commissioncontinues to encourage DTC to expand the use of this format to all IIDSystem users, and, where appropriate, generally to introduce internationally-standardizedprocedures and formats into all its services and systems.Pilot program users are eager to use the IID System for a greater numberof transactions. The Commission understands that pilot program users informedDTC that they expect the IID System to be much more useful and efficientwhen a greater number of users participates in the System. Approval ofthis proposed rule change will make the IID System available generallyto DTC participants.Approval of the IID System also will make the IID System available to allparticipants in the national clearance and settlement system through linkswith other registered clearing agencies. Thus, the IID System will fostercooperation and coordination in the clearance and settlement of institutional,international transactions among all participants in the national clearanceand settlement system.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Conclusion</ITAG>For the reasons discussed above and in Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 26374, the Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistentwith the Act and, in particular, section 17A.<T3>It is therefore ordered, </T3>pursuant to section 19(b)(2) of the Act,that the proposed rule change (File No. SR-DTC-89-03) be, and it herebyis, approved.For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegatedauthority.<ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
