Although Delft said it has no final figures for its totalnet losses in 1991, the company said they will likely be inthe neighborhood of 50 million guilders ($28.2 million). Alarge portion of the net loss is accounted for byextraordinary losses the company has incurred while itreorganizes its defense business.</LP><TEXT>   In the first half of 1991, Delft posted net losses of 17million guilders.   Delft said it was forced to revise its forecast becausesales in the second half of the year were lower than expectedat 190 million guilders. For all of 1991, sales amounted to360 million guilders, down from 433 million guilders in 1990.   Although slumping sales likely hurt the company, the mainproblem Delft faced in 1991 was a U.S. embargo that preventedDelft from using U.S.-made products that were integral partsof some of its equipment. The U.S. imposed the ban afterlearning that Delft's night vision devices were shipped toIraq and Jordan after the arms embargo was imposed on Iraq.</TEXT></DOC>
