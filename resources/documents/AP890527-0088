His estranged wife, American-born Margaret Papandreou, was duein Sunday to take part in a peace meeting coinciding with thesummit of leaders of the 16-nation North Atlantic TreatyOrganization. The gathering begins Monday.   Marching through an honor guard of Belgian military policemen,Papandreou was welcomed at Brussels National Airport by ChristosZacharakis, the Greek ambassador to NATO, and other diplomats.   One step behind was Miss Liani, the 35-year-old former airstewardess who lives with the Greek premier and accompanies himeverywhere.   She was dressed in a long, multi-colored flowered jacket, aroyal blue blouse, a wide black belt and a short purple skirt thatmatched the color of her lipstick and high heel shoes. A braceletadorned her left ankle.   Papandreou shook hands with the Greek diplomats. So did MissLiani.   The meeting was short. The prime minister did not speak withGreek reporters and left in an embassy limousine with Miss Liani.   Mrs. Papandreou will be attending the ``NATO Summit Watch''meeting, a kind of ``off-summit'' of peace organizations.   She is the international president of the ``Women for aMeaningful Summit'' organization, a peace group set up for thefirst summit between Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev and then-U.S.President Ronald Reagan.   Mrs. Papandreou will arrive in Brussels on Sunday and speak atthe opening session of the Summit Watch. Other speakers include:Ralph Earle II, a former director of the U.S. Arms Control andDisarmament Agency; John Isaacs, legislative director for the U.S.organization ``Council for a Livable World,'' and former BritishAir Vice-Marshal Anthony Mason.   It does not seem likely that Mrs. Papandreou will cross pathswith her husband and his girlfriend.   Elfie Woerner, wife of NATO Secretary-General Manfred Woerner,has planned a program for spouses accompanying the NATO leaders,including a visit to the Museum of Modern Art and a dinner.   There was no word on Miss Liani's agenda.   Papandreou, 70, who recently underwent heart surgery, has filedfor divorce from his wife and a ruling is expected shortly beforenational elections on June 18.   According to Athens newspaper reports, Papandreou will marryMiss Liani in a religious ceremony.</TEXT></DOC>
