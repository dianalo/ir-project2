The result was in large areas a massive dislike, for reasons which in some cases seemed sound, in some cases sound but irrelevant, and in other cases faintly absurd. The problem is that under the old corporate state system of paternal conservatism, the intellectuals felt they had a relatively high place in the hierarchy, and they were always being consulted for their views, given decorations and maintained handsomely almost entirely by the state. One conspicuous feature of the intellectual groups in the U.K. is how few of them actually earn their income from money paid by willing customers. By removing many elements of corporate statism, she removed the need to ask the old academics for advice. Even so, the language used was breathtaking. For the head of a Cambridge College to commit herself in public to refer to the Prime Minister as standing for odious suburban gentility, with her grooming and hair being &quot;not exactly vulgar, just low&quot; is amazing. </TEXT></DOC>
