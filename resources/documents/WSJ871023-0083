The president seems detached, even to some ardent supporters. He is totally on the defensive in the aftermath of the stock crash, reacting to events. His vow to personally get involved in budget negotiations with Congress could backfire; the Democrats, sensing his weakness, don't see him as a formidable adversary in this climate.    Treasury Secretary Baker also stumbled with public hints about the dollar just before Monday's crash. Congressional Democrats don't look much better. &quot;Everyone is scared politically,&quot; says New York Rep. Downey, a Democrat. Senate Finance Chairman Bentsen's claim that the protectionist trade measure will calm international markets further shakes investor confidence.    Budget Chief Miller is dismissed by White House and Treasury officials as out of step; chief economist Sprinkel is considered irrelevant.    TOUGH U.S. TACTICS win quick economic results abroad but raise hackles.    The public campaign to get West Germany to lower interest rates works; Japan also eases. But the pressure leaves a bad taste. &quot;We always feared that this international coordination would be used by the U.S. to bully us,&quot; says a German official. &quot;Now we are seeing it happen.&quot; Even British officials suggest that U.S. policies lie behind the big market crash.    Foreign concessions are grudging; Bonn applies its reduced short-money rates to fewer transactions than usual. The Bank of Japan warns that fighting inflation remains a top priority; that implies rates may rise later. The U.S. may have to keep the heat on. But jittery markets, fearful of international squabbling, could crimp that effort.    IRAN'S ATTACKS on Kuwait pose a dilemma for U.S. strategists.    Policy makers want to avoid extending U.S. protection beyond escorting ships through the Persian Gulf. But increased Iranian assaults in Kuwait would increase pressure for broader U.S. military support. &quot;The war is going to escalate on the Kuwaiti side rather than with Iraq,&quot; predicts David Mizrahi, editor of MidEast Report.    So far, U.S. officials are urging Kuwait to beef up its own defenses. &quot;We are intensely concerned,&quot; says one State Department official. But he insists that &quot;our policy remains to escort U.S.-flag vessels -- period.&quot; Arab states' uneasiness about the U.S. commitment is eased somewhat by the Senate's decision to sidestep the War Powers Act, which could have forced a gulf pullback.    The U.S. continues to warn Iran against retaliations for the American attack on an Iranian sea platform.    ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL? Congressional Democrats are expected to scrutinize the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodities Futures Trading Commission in the wake of the stock plunge. They note that former SEC Chairman Shad testified last spring that chances of a 500-point drop in the market were remote.    STIRRING A FUSS: Though many political analysts think Jeane Kirkpatrick won't enter the GOP presidential race, in New Hampshire ex-Laxalt partisans, former Gov. Thomson and the Manchester Union Leader escalate urgings that she run. Kemp backers, fearing their man would be hurt, try to portray the former U.N. ambassador as liberal on welfare, taxes and abortion.    BEYOND BORK: Reaganites vie to push their Supreme Court choices.    The White House expands its list as different factions line up behind candidates. Some Justice Department officials back federal Judge Anthony Kennedy of California. Others say he is too moderate and promote Judge Pasco Bowman of Missouri. Some conservatives still press for an intellectual force, such as Judge Ralph Winter of Connecticut or Judge Laurence Silberman of Washington, D.C.    White House aides say a fresh face might be more salable than oft-considered candidates. Former Chief Justice Burger touts Judge Gerald Tjoflat of Florida as a law-and-order jurist. Judge Pamela Rymer of Los Angeles could gain. The White House, one adviser says, will consider conservative Southerners and women, who might be harder for some senators to oppose.    Reagan will quickly be given a short list of final choices when the Senate officially votes down Bork.    MINOR MEMOS: After the Navy's Persian Gulf attack, Weinberger said that &quot;events did move with great decisiveness&quot; and &quot;resulted in nearly total destruction,&quot; adding: &quot;I'm speaking of the stock market.&quot; . . . Dole, commenting on his wife's resignation as transportation secretary to help him become president, quips: &quot;Elizabeth's now out of work, and that's another reason I need a better job.&quot; . . . An old mill in New York that was once in Oliver North's family is renovated by artists and dubbed &quot;Fawn Hall.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
