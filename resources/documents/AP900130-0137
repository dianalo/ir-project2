Philip N. Brownstein, a Washington lawyer and former FederalHousing Administration commissioner, testified before a SenateBanking Committee subcommittee investigating the Department ofHousing and Urban Development. Brownstein, on a panel of formerfederal housing officials who testified, served under presidentsJohn F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.   Brownstein said that while housing programs may vary in the waysthey fund or encourage development of housing for low-incomepeople, any program will be costly.   ``For all intents and purposes, all housing programs respondingto lower income needs have been terminated,'' he said.   Without more construction, he said, the homeless will grow and``its human and economic cost will dwarf any price tag attached tofederal housing efforts.''   ``It is critical today that some program be instituted andfunded which will result in new units being put in place by meansof new construction or substantial rehabilitation,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
