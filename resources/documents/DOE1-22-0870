<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-22-0870 </DOCNO><TEXT>We give details of a theoretical model for deuteron photodisintegrationbelow the pion production threshold, which includes contributions tothe current and charge densities from the impulse approximation (includingrelativistic corrections) and from the exchange of one meson. Contributionsfrom the exchange of two or more mesons are systematically neglected.For one-meson exchange, we consider the exchange of a pion, both withoutand with a {Delta}(1231) intermediate state, and the exchange of rhoand {omega}. From factors are included at the strong vertices, with acut-off mass for the {pi}N{Delta} vertex which is smaller than that forthe {pi}NN vertex. We use current conservation in calculating the electricmultipole amplitudes and give expressions for the multipole amplitudesused in the calculation.</TEXT></DOC>
