One data set came from the Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancers(OSCC); the other from the National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB)and findings are compatible with background radiation being the singlemost important cause of juvenile neoplasms. It also emerged that theseneoplasms have a strongly clustered distribution. No obvious cause ofclusters was found, but they had associations with prenatal and postnatalillnesses as well as background radiation. Therefore, since there ismounting sensitivity to infections during the latent phase of leukaemia,cancer clusters might be the result of competing causes of death havingan epidemic distribution. The findings as a whole are compatible withall man-made additions to background (including leakages of radioactivityfrom a reprocessing plant) adding to risk of an early cancer death. Proofthat certain leukaemia clusters in the vicinity of two reprocessing plantswere caused in this way must await collection of data.</TEXT></DOC>
