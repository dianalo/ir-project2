A woman hostage was killed in the final shootout that alsoseriously wounded the gunmen and a second woman hostage, andslightly injured a female accomplice. A 15-year-old hostage and apoliceman were killed Wednesday, one day after the bandits robbed abank in a small northwestern town and commandeered a bus carrying30 passengers.   At least three other people were injured in the two-day ordeal,in which the pistol-waving bandits met with pursuing journalistsseveral times, letting reporters inside the captive bus in Bremenand holding a roadside news conference in Cologne.   The bandits, Hans-Juergen Roesner, 31, and Dieter Degowski, 32,had traded the bus and all but two hostages for a BMW sedan afterthey crossed over into the Netherlands.   Officers stopped the sedan on a crowded autobahn at 1:45 p.m. bysetting off exploding devices that emit a powerful flash of light,said police spokesman Horst Fechner.   A police vehicle from a special tactical unit rammed the back ofthe getaway car, and the two sides started shooting, said JuergenHosse, president of Cologne's police department.   ``The criminals opened fire, and we shot back,'' Hosse said,adding that police don't know who fired the bullet that killed thewoman hostage.   The other hostage received ``life-threatening injuries,'' saidFechner, a police spokesman in the northwestern German city ofRecklinghausen where a special command post was set up tocoordinate police strategy. He refused to identify the woundedhostage.   Later Thursday, police spokesman, Harald Treutinger said thewounded woman's condition had improved.   Police refused to say where they had taken the gunmen and theirwoman accomplice. Treutinger said an investigation had begun but nocharges had been brought.   Authorities said the inquiry could lead to charges of murder,hostage-taking and other crimes with a maximum penalty of life inprison for the two gunmen. It was unclear what charges the womancould face.   The ordeal began Tuesday, when the gunmen took two hostagesduring a bank robbery in Gladbeck, 50 miles north of Cologne. Afterdaylong negotiations, they fled in a car provided by authorities.They carried with them about $227,000, of which $162,000 wasprovided by police to ensure the hostages' safety.   They surfaced Wednesday in Bremen, 135 miles northwest ofGladbeck, where police said they opened fire in a vegetable market.No one was injured.   Joined by a female accomplice, the bandits commandeered a citybus and drove away with about 30 hostages.   Four elderly passengers, a child and the two original hostageswere freed, and the bus careened along the autobahn for severalhours late Wednesday and early Thursday.   Hermann Wahl, another Recklinghausen police spokesman, said anofficer died in a crash pursuing the gunmen, and the robbers shotto death a 15-year-old Italian boy aboard the bus Wednesday.   Wahl said the boy, who was not identified, was killed afterpolice grabbed the robbers' accomplice. Officials identified heronly as ``Marion Irma L.''   She later was allowed to rejoin the gunmen, and the bus crossedthe border into the Netherlands near the Dutch town of Oldenzaalearly Thursday.   The gunmen demanded a high-powered BMW as an escape vehicle andthreatened to shoot hostages, and police provided the car.   The robbers shot and wounded two captives, then freed all buttwo female hostages, said Dutch police spokesman Jan Houdel. Thecondition of the wounded captives was not known.   A shootout ensued, and the female accomplice was shot in theleg. The gunmen, their wounded companion and two women hostagesthen sped back to West Germany.   After speeding through the Ruhr industrial area, the car stoppedin the center of Cologne on Thursday morning and was immediatelysurrounded by journalists.   ``We aren't going to negotiate with police any more, because weknow that leads to nothing,'' said Degowski. ``I want to saythrough the news media that the police should back off.''   He sat in the back seat of the BMW, pointing a pistol at a womanhostage squeezed in beside him.   The woman said she felt ``good'' and added, ``I was afraidbefore, because I thought the police might move in and I'd bekilled.'' It was not immediately known if she was the hostage wholater was killed.   Roesner sat at the steering wheel and criticized the police. Heoccasionally waved his pistol at the reporters.   The robbers ordered a Cologne journalist to get into the car asa third hostage. They released him before they sped into the trapset up outside Bonn by the special police commando unit.   Herbert Schnoor, interior minister of North Rhine-Westphaliastate, criticized the news media and said the interviews with thebandits endangered the hostages.   ``At no point did the police have the help of the media in theattempt to protect the hostages,'' said Schnoor, whose stateincludes Gladbeck.   But a poll taken by the respected Wickert Institute in Tuebingensaid 93 percent of the respondents could not understand why policedid not act sooner to end the ordeal. Eighty-nine percent of thethe 1,708 West Germans questioned said the top state politiciansresponsible for law and order should resign.</TEXT></DOC>
