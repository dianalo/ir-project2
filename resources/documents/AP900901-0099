One plan was being prepared by the governmentof Premier Nikolai Ryzhkov, and the other from a working groupheaded by Stanislav Shatalin, a member of Mikhail S. Gorbachev'sPresidential Council advisory group.</TEXT><TEXT>   PRICES:   RYZHKOV PLAN: Prices would be raised at once _ perhaps by asmuch as two to three times _ by administrative decree, with alater, gradual transformation to market prices. Hardest-hit groups,such as the elderly and non-working mothers, would get compensation.   SHATALIN PLAN: The market, not administrative decree, woulddetermine prices on many goods. There would be gradual increases inwholesale prices of energy. Prices would be frozen on about 100 to150 basic goods and services for the entire transition period.After that, the prices of 70 percent to 80 percent of the goodswould be free-floating. Rationing is not ruled out and socialassistance would be provided.</TEXT><TEXT>   PRIVATIZATION OF BUSINESSES AND PROPERTY:   RYZHKOV PLAN: Long-term denationalization of businesses andproperty; the state would control at least 50 percent of shares inmost industries.   SHATALIN PLAN: State control over businesses and property wouldend, with the private sector prevailing in most industries. Someproperty would be sold at low or symbolic cost to laborcollectives. Leasing might be possible, as would be private familyproperty, but the republics would determine some forms of ownership.</TEXT><TEXT>   BUDGET, FINANCING:   RYZHKOV PLAN: Reliance on taxation for income.   SHATALIN PLAN: Strict control on state spending, measures for asounder ruble, reform of the banking system.</TEXT><TEXT>   CENTRAL CONTROLandequals;   RYZHKOV PLAN: Strongly resembles the present system in that thecentral government still would maintain major control, determiningwhat its own powers should be and leaving residual powers to therepublics. The central government could reduce its powers if soinclined.   SHATALIN PLAN: Economic union would be on a voluntary basis. Thesovereign republics together would decide what powers the centralgovernment should have.</TEXT></DOC>
