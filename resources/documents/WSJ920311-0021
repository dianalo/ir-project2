Crude oil for April delivery edged up two cents a barrelto $18.69. Heating oil for April rose 0.65 cent to finish at51.83 cents a gallon while gasoline increased 0.52 cent tosettle at 57.99 cents a gallon.</LP><TEXT>   Talks between Iraqi and United Nations officials aren'texpected to be fruitful. And traders are concerned thatcontinued recalcitrance by Iraq could lead to renewedhostilities.   Rolf Ekeus, head of the U.N. Special Commission, said thatIraq has been hiding Scud missiles from U.N. inspectors.Iraqi Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz has denied thoseallegations. But today, the U.N. has scheduled a daylongmeeting at which Iraq will be publicly asked to respond tocharges that it isn't complying with U.N. demands that itdismantle its weaponry.   Continued unrest in Venezuela is another situation thatmarket participants say they are watching. As VenezuelanPresident Carlos Andres Perez continued to realign hiscabinet yesterday, there was rioting in downtown Caracas.Just last month, there was an attempt to overthrow thegovernment. The U.S., especially along the East Coast,imports a large amount of oil products from Venezuela.   Also having an impact on prices are reports that Iranianexports have dropped off in recent weeks. According to DowJones International Petroleum Report, there have been longdelays in loading at Kharg Island, Iran's major oil exportfacility. Iran, a major player in the Organization ofPetroleum Exporting Countries, may be shipping 50% less fromthat facility. As many as 40 oil tankers are waiting to pickup crude oil cargoes there.   Inventory statistics released by the American PetroleumInstitute late yesterday show that crude stocks last week inthe U.S. unexpectedly rose by 7,030,000 barrels to 346.8million barrels. Distillate supplies decreased 2,730,000barrels to 105.7 million barrels while gasoline inventoriesfell 4,170,000 barrels to 225.4 million barrels.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices fell as traderstook profits because of political unrest in Armenia. Newsservices reported yesterday that radical elements in Armeniahad captured 10 Soviet officers and were holding themhostage, seeking weapons in exchange for their release. Grainprices are sensitive to military action of any kind in theregion because Armenia is a member of the Commonwealth ofIndependent States, a large buyer of U.S. grain. Military orpolitical turmoil, traders' thinking goes, could make theBush administration reluctant to grant the former Sovietrepublics additional export credits for purchases of U.S.grain. Russia has asked for $600 million in additionalcredits, and Ukraine has asked for $300 million in credits.The price of the corn contract for May delivery fell 2.75cents to $2.76 a bushel; the May soybean contract declinedfour cents to $5.9625 a bushel; and the May wheat contractwas down three cents to $4.0025 a bushel.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices snapped a weeklong decline. TheMarch contract finished at $1.0195 a pound, up 1.05 cents.The actively traded April contract rose 1.15 cents to settleat $1.0210. Yesterday's gains represented a &quot;correction fromthe market perhaps being oversold,&quot; said Richard Hirsch, vicepresident at Sharps Pixley Inc. Mr. Hirsch said futuresprices were buoyed by &quot;good solid technical buying and someshort covering.&quot; Traders cover their short positions, or betsthe price will fall, by buying offsetting contracts.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Prices of soon-to-expire contracts fell.Futures for March delivery ended at $1.4325 a pound, down1.70 cents. The actively traded May contract finished at$1.4210, down 1.85 cents. Judith Ganes, a senior analyst atMerrill Lynch, said investors were rolling out of longpositions, or bets that prices will rise, in the nearbycontracts and moving into contracts that will be affected bythe new orange crop. One of the reasons for the shift may bebecause the &quot;old&quot; crop contracts such as March, May and Julyare trading at a significant premium to the &quot;new&quot; cropcontracts. Investors wonder &quot;why should they pay storagecosts for a contract that is more expensive&quot; said Ms. Ganes.In addition, Ms. Ganes said expectations that the 1992-1993orange crop will be strong were depressing futures prices.&quot;Right now, the 1992-1993 crop is blooming in Florida,&quot; saidMs. Ganes. &quot;The bloom is supposed to be incredible. If itsets {into fruit}, it could mean a significant increase innext year's output.&quot; Today the Agriculture Department isexpected to release its crop report for the 1991-1992 season.Even though it could show a modest increase in orangeproduction, Ms. Ganes said it should have little effect onthe market because the gain was expected.</TEXT></DOC>
