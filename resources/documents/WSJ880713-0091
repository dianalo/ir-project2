The company, which is facing sluggish growth in its instant-photography business, also announced plans to enter the $7 billion-a-year conventional-film market, putting it in head-to-head competition with market leader Eastman Kodak Co.    Under the restructuring, Polaroid will cut its U.S. work force by up to 8% and eliminate some non-essential research and development projects -- resulting in a pretax charge of $75 million for the second half of 1988 -- and has created an employee stock ownership program that owns 14% of the company's stock. In addition, it will repurchase $300 million of its stock on the open market.    Individuals close to Polaroid conceded that the moves are in part a response to the company's belief that someone has accumulated 2% to 5% of its stock. Some of those individuals think Texas investor Robert Bass and associates hold the stake, while others in the Polaroid camp believe it's held by another, unnamed investor.    The restructuring &quot;is a very good defensive move, a reaction to takeover rumors,&quot; said Alex Henderson, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities. &quot;This makes it a less attractive takeover candidate.&quot;    Earlier this year, Polaroid had announced plans for an ESOP that would own 5% of the company's stock. The increase in the amount to 14%, all in newly issued shares, will make it more difficult for a hostile bidder to succeed.    Polaroid has been considered a potential takeover target in part because of speculation over the amount of damages it might be awarded in a patent infringement case it won against Kodak. A federal judge ruled in 1985 that Kodak infringed on Polaroid's instant-photography patents, and Polaroid has asked for up to $5.7 billion in damages. However, the case has been clouded recently because Kodak is seeking to stay the infringement ruling on the ground that the judge had a potential financial interest in the outcome.    Polaroid's entry into the conventional-film business will put it into competition with Kodak in a major photography market for the first time since Kodak dropped its instant camera line as a result of the patent decision.    Polaroid said it will &quot;soon&quot; introduce 35-millimeter, 126 and 110 film world-wide, moving into the conventional-film business for the first time. The company said it has test-marketed the film under its name in Spain and Portugal over the past couple of years and has a 5% to 6% market share.    A spokesman noted that the conventional-film market world-wide is about $7 billion a year. &quot;Even if you get a small percentage of that business, it's a big amount,&quot; said the spokesman, who declined to say what the company's market-share goal is.    Polaroid won't manufacture the conventional film initially, but instead buy it from an outside supplier and put its name on it. Brenda Lee Landry, an analyst at Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., said Agfa-Gevaert AG made the film Polaroid used in its test markets and likely will be a supplier, although Polaroid wouldn't comment.    Polaroid founder Edwin Land, who retired in 1982, long opposed entering the conventional-film business. But slowing growth in Polaroid's mainstay instant-photography business has prompted it to look elsewhere, said Prudential-Bache's Mr. Henderson. &quot;The outlook for instant isn't as positive now, and they have to get into other areas,&quot; he noted.    Taking on Kodak, which has an estimated 80% market share in the U.S. and 60% world-wide, and Fuji Photo Film Co., No. 2 with 8% to 10% in the U.S. and 20% to 25% world-wide, won't be easy. But analysts say that Polaroid has little to lose and a lot to gain.    Polaroid's well-known brand name, together with its established distribution system, will produce immediate sales. At the same time, its initial cost of entry will be low because it won't make the film itself. &quot;I think they should do well,&quot; said Eugene Glazer, an analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., estimating that Polaroid could match Fuji's U.S. market share in two years.    Polaroid entered the videotape market in a similar fashion a few years ago -- buying tapes made by a foreign manufacturer and putting its name on -- and now has a 12% market share with annual sales of about $100 million, making it the market leader in the U.S.    Overall, Polaroid had net income of $116.1 million, or $1.88 a share, on sales of $1.76 billion last year, and analysts had been predicting before the announcement of the restructuring charge that earnings will drop slightly this year as a result of sluggish growth in instant photography.    In composite New York Stock Exchange trading, Polaroid shares closed at $31.25, up $1.50, in heavy volume of about 1.9 million shares.    On its restructuring, Polaroid president and chief executive I. MacAllister Booth said the moves would &quot;enhance shareholder value and improve profitability.&quot; The company expects to reduce employment by 500 to 800 U.S. employees through early retirement and severance programs; the company has 10,000 U.S. employees and 3,000 overseas.    The company also will eliminate &quot;various business and research areas that simply do not fit our long-term strategy,&quot; he said. Although Polaroid didn't indentify any of these areas, sources said that candidates include fiber optics, photovoltaics and magnetic floppy disks for computers.    Beginning next year, the company said it will realize some $50 million a year in savings from these measures, and will save another $20 million from reduced manufacturing costs and non-recurrence of start-up costs.    The ESOP plan, combined with the open market stock repurchase program, will have the effect of moving more stock into employees' hands. As a result of issuing 10 million new shares for the ESOP, the number of common shares outstanding will increase to about 71 million, Polaroid said. The ESOP shares will be bought with employee funds, with 10% of management salaries and 5% of other employees' pay being used to pay for the stock over a 10-year period.    The repurchase of $300 million of stock on the open market from &quot;time to time&quot; will reduce the number of shares outstanding to about the level prior to the creation of the ESOP, a spokesman noted.    Polaroid will borrow the $300 million for the stock repurchase, increasing its debt-to-equity ratio to nearly 33% from about 11%.    Asked why the board decided that the ESOP should own 14% of Polaroid's stock instead of the 5% originally planned, a spokesman said, &quot;For employeees to participate in the growth of the company, {the ESOP} needed a larger share of the company.&quot;    ---   Bryan Burrough in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
