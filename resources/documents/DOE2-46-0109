As a startingmaterial, commercially available La{sub 2}O{sub 3}, SrCO{sub 3} and CuOwere weighted to a required stoichiometric ratio and mixed in a mortar.The mixture was then put in a cup-type alumina crucible, only the centralconfined area of 4mm in diameter was melted from above by laser beam,and the crystal was grown with manual feeding of the mixture. The crystalstructure was examined by powder X-ray diffractometry, and the occurrenceof superconductivity was confirmed by measuring a magnetic susceptibility.The on-set temperature to superconductivity was about 35K which was alittle lower than the nominal transition temperature of 40K. It was consideredthat the inferiority might be caused by the involved incompletely reactedmaterial. In conclusion, it became clear that if a stationary powderfeeding system was used, this direct laser melt method could providea method capable of preparing sizable and qualified single crystals withouta crucible.
