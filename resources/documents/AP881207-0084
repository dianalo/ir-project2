The settlement came Tuesday in the sixth day of a trial beforethe Health Claims Arbitration Board, which handles malpractice casesin Maryland.   The boy, Jerome Durant Jr., was delivered by emergency Caesareansection at Maryland General Hospital unable to speak, hear, see ormove normally. The toddler functions at the level of a 2-month-oldchild, experts said.   Experts testified that doctors ignored clear signs that hismother should have been given a Caesarean section when a fetalmonitor indicated the baby's heart was sluggish. Instead, she wasinitially given a drug that produced contractions, putting stress onher womb and depriving the child of adequate blood flow and oxygen.   The baby was delivered surgically, weighing more than 11 pounds,unable to breathe and without a heartbeat.   The boy's mother, Veronica Williams, and her attorneys said theyagreed not to disclose the amount of the settlement, but The Sunsaid it includes $581,589 cash and monthly payments of $9,155 with 3percent annual increases for inflation.   Ms. Williams said the settlement will enable her to affordprivate nurses and therapists, good doctors and expensive equipmentfor her child's care.   ``So far they're saying he will never be able to do any of thesethings himself _ walk or feed himself or anything,'' Mrs. Williamssaid. ``The last two years have been extremely hard. He takes up allmy time. He's constantly with me. My social life has stopped.''   Defendants in the malpractice suit included Maryland GeneralHospital; Constant Care Health Care System, a medical clinic whereMs. Williams was enrolled, and obstetricians Sushma Sidh, RonaldMiles and Thomas Ray.</TEXT></DOC>
