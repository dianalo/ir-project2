 In a world gone mad with greed,legions of white-shirted, bow-tied, and calculator-laden accounting whizzeskeep us just a breathless pencil-point away from financial Armageddon.andP;  Readany newspaper and you'll find some disheartening account of &quot;cooking thebooks,&quot; as the Wall Street Journal so succinctly put it when reporting theMiniScribe case.andM;MiniScribe, a onetime leading computer disk-drive company nestled in theColorado Hills, appeared to be phenomenally successful.andP;  While competitorswere laying off droves of workers, MiniScribe posted record-breakingearnings.andP;  In a three-month period, receivables bloated from $109 million to$173 million, an increase of more than 59%.andP;  Under any other circumstances,these profits would have been great news except that they looked darnsuspicious, and for good reason--the numbers were pure fabrication.andP;  Theywere so convoluted that the company had almost no way of producing accuratefinancial numbers for the preceding three years.andM;Turn the newspaper page and you'll find more nasty goings-on.andP;  The June 1989issue of Institutional Investor printed a lengthy report on the games somemoney managers play with performance measurements.andP;  One irked chief ofinvestments for a major money center vividly described the founder of a newmoney-management boutique: &quot;The guy is a former Wall Street investmentstrategist who's selling an asset-allocation model with simulated results.andO;The results don't bear even the vaguest resemblance to the numbers he wasresponsible for when he was in print.andP;  We know the real results because wesubscribed to his stuff when he was a broker.&quot;andM;It would be a disservice to the financial community to give you theimpression that everyone in the business is a crook.andP;  This business is nodifferent from any other; it has good eggs and rotten eggs.andP;  However, in thiscase you're often dealing with Grandma's life savings, and she deserves a bitof scrupulous attention.andM;For the most part, this responsibility is undertaken by the thousands ofaccounting firms out there in audit-land.andP;  Because they all aspire to Big Sixstatus, we'll concentrate on how they use the new and exciting world ofadvanced technology to enhance their defense of the honor of the numbers.andM;POTENTIAL APPLICATIONSandM;Audit planning is at top of the list with the goal of using an expert systemto assist in evaluating risks.andP;  This evaluation is a complex one since itimplies that the auditor understands the relationships between the client'saccounts and economic, political, and organizational factors.andM;The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants defines audit risk asthe product of inherent, control, and detection risks.andP;  Inherent risk is thebasic risk of the client's accounts being susceptible to error; control riskis the risk of the client's control mechanisms being unable to uncover theseerrors.andP;  Detection risk resides with the accounting firm charged withperforming the audit--the risk that it will not detect either inherent orcontrol risk.andM;Inherent risk is an audit's main emphasis.andP;  The firm evaluates factors suchas susceptibility of the asset to theft, past history of error, experiencelevel of internal accounting staff, management diligence, and a host of otherfactors.andP;  The basic approach to audit review is the questionnaire, which canbe thought of as a &quot;scope&quot; document outlining the specifics of the audittailored to the client.andM;Three methods of review are possible.andP;  The first is simply to question thefirm, &quot;How was the figure 'excess net capital' calculated?&quot;andP;  The secondrequires the auditor to observe the process of calculating excess net capitalby the firm's staff.andP;  The third approach is called &quot;testing.&quot;andP;  The auditoruses sampling methodology to select representative accounts and calculatesand compares these results to the actual.andM;The use of AI software during this phase of the audit is something all of theBig Six are looking into (if they aren't using it already).andP;  A series ofexpert components could be developed.andP;  Since the scope of the questionnaireis generic at best, it takes hours of planning to tailor the exam to thespecific client.andP;  An expert module could be employed to perform this planningautomatically, based on client profiles and variable data entered at thebeginning of the session.andP;  Expert systems could also be employed to assistthe auditor in making the decision whether to question, observe, or test anattribute.andP;  Once this decision is made, expert systems could be used in thearea of smart sampling very advantageously.andM;The other factor in the equation is the robustness of the firm's internalaccounting controls.andP;  Here the accounting firm scrutinizes the acceptabilityof the client firm's accounting procedures and controls in detecting inherentrisk.andP;  Expert systems could be a big help as the auditor surveys theoperational procedures employed within the accounting and managementdepartments.andP;  A &quot;smart&quot; questionnaire could be developed to lead the clientand auditor through a series of questions, periodically requesting a test andevaluating these results.andM;Aside from the crucial task of assaying audit risk, an expert system could beused as an accounting-decision assistant to indicate the proper accountingprocedure to be applied for complex transactions (such as foreign exchange).andO;This role is the primary one for Big-Six expert systems.andP;  The accountingfirms are rapidly automating every procedure manual used to make them notonly portable for field use, but smart as well so the auditor doesn't have to&quot;call home&quot; for the answers.andM;COOPERS andamp; LYBRANDandM;Anatole Gershman agrees with my list of important projects for the Big Six toundertake.andP;  In fact, he spearheaded a massive project that addresses theproblem of audit risk.andP;  The knowledge-acquisition phase alone, wherethousands of rules were generated, lasted more than a year.andM;The process of knowledge acquisition is unique at Coopers.andP;  Acquisition isdata-driven and much of the knowledge is obtained during simulationexercises.andP;  In this way a more accurate representation of how the data ismanipulated can be obtained than in relying on how the user thinks theproblem is broken down.andP;  Once this knowledge is collected, a small prototype,or as they call it, a model of knowledge, is built.andP;  Developers examine itsinner workings and determine how the expert system should ideally work.andM;Coopers used what they called the &quot;dreaded questionnaire.&quot;andP;  It waslong--sometimes almost 200 pages--and had plenty of room for error.andP;  Added tothis equation was the new tax accountant; none of these green accountants,try as they may, could make the questionnaire &quot;talk&quot; to them.andP;  They wantedexplanations; they wanted enlightenment.andP;  But a piece of paper doesn't talk.andM;So here we have the elements of success: one, an idea for a product thatwould make Coopers premier among accounting firms.andP;  Two, the project wasquestionnaire-oriented.andP;  If you survey AI literature you'll find that almosteverybody advocates these types of projects as fodder for expertsystematizing.andP;  Three, the users wanted a bigger and better questionnaire, toexplain the why and how.andP;  And last but not least, the experts were willing todonate their time to the effort.andP;  What a perfect combination.andM;They created a financial-oriented expert-systems shell called FFAST[R] usingGold Hill's Golden Common LISP.FFAST[R] was created as a shell for the manyfinancial applications that Coopers envisioned, only one of which isExperTax.andP;  But FFAST[R] is more than just a shell; the system is a wholeenvironment comprising software, knowledge-acquisition tools, and knowledgeengineering.andM;After many sessions distilling the expertise of more than 20 senior tax andaudit experts, the dreaded questionnaire was dreaded no longer.andP;  The ExperTaxinference engine is a forward-chaining, rule-based system incorporating aframe manager.andP;  This frame manager works with two frame types: questionframes, associated with questions to be asked, and issue frames, whichrepresent valid issues involved with answer analysis.andP;  When all was said anddone, the group had formulated more than 1,000 frames.andM;ExperTax functions as an intelligent questionnaire to guide the user throughthe information-gathering process.andP;  The system is smart enough to ask onlythose questions relevant to the client situation and more than capable ofraising appropriate issues and using its dialog prowess to ask morequestions.andP;  For novice accountants, it features an explain facility that canjustify a question and why the response was relevant.andP;  In addition, ExperTaxprovides an audit trail of questions, answers, and user notes.andP;  In Nov. 1986each audit and tax partner was asked to assign ExperTax to at least oneoperation.andP;  The system was so instantly popular that soon all 97 offices werebegging for copies.andM;PEAT MARWICK MAINandM;Although the biggest of the Big Six, Peat is not one of the biggestdevelopers of AI software.andP;  But it does see the possibilities.andM;Rather than building a shell as Coopers andamp; Lybrand did, Peat used commercialexpert-system shells to create Loan Probe, which assists banking clients inassessing their commercial loan portfolios and detecting probable losses.andM;Loan Probe (which was built in Information Builders' Level5) became sopopular that Peat is readying it for market.andP;  It makes reviewing loans easyand offers appropriate recommendations, such as whether to establish a lossreserve or restructure the terms of the loan.andM;In 1983 Gary Ribar, senior manager of the audit research group, got the greenlight to build an expert loan advisor.andP;  Peat Marwick was well aware of theincreasing volatility of the banking industry; the more complex bank auditsbecame, the more appealing the prospect of an expert loan advisor was.andP;  LoanProbe's purpose was to act as a tool for internal audit use in reviewingcommercial bank loans.andP;  (Not all bank loans, just the most complicated onesthat statistical review methods didn't handle well.)andM;The collection of loans relies heavily on subjective judgment rather thancold statistics.andP;  In most cases, the auditors evaluating loans manuallycompleted this task in about one hour.andP;  Their methodology consisted ofapplying procedural and gut instinct rules along what essentially was a vastdecision tree.andP;  To those of us who know little about the behind-the-sceneswork of loan evaluation, this process seems deceptively simple.andM;The process of loan approval is even more complex.andP;  The bank first takes amagnifying glass to financial condition, entailing scrutiny of short-termliquidity, business risk, and financial risk.andP;  Short-term liquidity is easyto understand: it means how well you can pay your everyday bills with theassets youu have on hand.andP;  Even so, from a bank's perspective, many factorsrequire analysis.andP;  How else can these short-term assets be used?andP;  How recentare the financial figures under examination?andP;  How objective are thesefinancials?andP;  And how to factor in all that nonfinancial information?andP;  Thedetails are neatly tied together with a weighting factor.andM;Risk, on the other hand, is much more vague.andP;  So many factors come into playto make short-term assets inaccessible for loan repayment that the loanofficer almost needs a ouija board.andP;  (&quot;Maybe the demand will dry up.andP;  Maybethe company will experience internal fights among its owners.andP;  Maybe therewill be a flurry of hostile or none-too-hostile takeovers.&quot;)andM;The final two factors analyzed are cash-flow prospects and loan performancehistory.andP;  While anyone who has ever applied for a loan or a credit cardinstinctively understands why the bank may be interested in their past loansand how they repaid them, the concept of cash-flow prospects is much lessclear.andP;  The bank monitors the money that goes in and out of the till relativeto the repayment of all your debt, including this new loan.andP;  How much moneyis usually in the till?andP;  How is this amount expected to change?andM;Ribar approached his experts with all of these questions.andP;  Two primary peoplewere selected as target experts, although many others were secondary sources.andO;Usually the knowledge engineering team prepares for the experts by studyingthe manuals and checklists that are the &quot;bibles&quot; of the department.andP;  In thiscase, there were none; Ribar was a babe in the woods.andM;There would ultimately be 4,000 hours of interviews during a three-yearperiod.andP;  If Ribar had any advice at all for aspiring expert system creatorsit would be: &quot;Don't underestimate the knowledge-acquisition process.&quot;andP;  ForRibar, it became a game of &quot;Clue.&quot;andP;  Although each interview session wasextremely well-structured, Ribar found most of his golden nuggets outside ofthe conference room.andP;  He began to develop an ear for hints the experts wouldthrow out as they walked out of the room and down the hall.andP;  He found it wasall a matter of understanding the metaphors they managed on a daily basis.andO;After their first prototype test at a bank in Miami, they walked out of thedemo room with the uneasy feeling they hadn't quite captured the essence ofcash flow.andP;  As Ribar walked despondently behind two of Peat's partners, heoverheard them say something that clicked in his mind, and finally he saw thelight.andM;Ultimately the Level5 system would capture 9,000 rules.andP;  It would store achecklist of more than 1,500 questions (such as whether management has anykind of internal conflict to distract them from the routine conduct ofbusiness).andP;  From the 9,000 rules about the three types of loans the systemevaluates, auditors would traverse only the route they were interested in andthat had relevance to the situation at the borrower's end.andP;  Occasionally, youmay get waylaid by a question seeming to have a nebulous answer.andP;  Loan Probehandles this problem by using fuzzy sets; questions are allowed answers thatpermit a weighing of evidence such as strong, moderate, or weak.andM;With the knowledge complete, the team was able to tailor the system toprovide a front-end data-gathering mechanism permitting the automaticimportation of loan information.andP;  This feature was appealing to many usersbecause it permitted the system to drive the judgment process; novices couldview Loan Probe in action and learn both the system and the auditing process.andO;More advanced users preferred to enter the input during the system'sforward-chaining process.andM;Whichever way the system is used, it successfully evaluates the commercialloan process.andP;  Ribar found the system's measure of success to be thereduction of auditor workload during the audit process.andP;  This process ischaracterized by a team approach: auditors on the very bottom rung performthe grunt work and the results are passed up successive levels of teammanagement.andP;  Usually each level of management has a modicum of work to &quot;cleanup&quot; the evaluation.andP;  Loan Probe performs a clean evaluation from the startinggate.andM;ERNST andamp; YOUNGandM;With the merger of two of the largest of the Big Six, you get the sidebenefit of a manager of two AI departments.andP;  When Ernst andamp; Whinney merged withArthur Young, an interesting synergy of AI talent was forged.andM;Rick Richardson, national director of technology, talks about Eandamp;Y's AY/ASQ(or at least that was the original name before AY became EY).andP;  Again, thegoal was to expert systematize that all-important audit planning.andP;  During twoyears of all-nighters they created an expert system containing thousands ofrules and capable of asking subsets of some 45,000 planning questions.andM;The system was based on the heuristics, or gut intelligence, of seniorpartners.andP;  Within one automated system the whole of auditor methodology wasencoded for posterity.andP;  Running on a Macintosh and written in Pascal, AY/ASQprovides an online manual, a user-configurable rule-base and one heck of asmart assistant for audit planning.andM;The system builds a matrix of risk and recommends applicable procedures.andP;  Forexample, it may tell you that receivables are significant and request that aparticular procedure be dispatched.andP;  Eandamp;Y found that using this system madethe audit process much more efficient.andP;  Less time was spent planning so morecould be spent doing.andM;Not to be outdone ty the American colonies, the very, very British arm ofErnst andamp; Young was faced with a very inconvenient problem.andP;  The cumbersomeeuropean practice of collecting a value added tax, or VAT, was developinginto a bit of a nuisance for Eandamp;Y auditors and advisors.andP;  The problem resultedin the British introduction of a whole slew of civil penalties fornoncompliance to the rigid VAT code.andM;Since Eandamp;Y auditors had long made it a practice to review their clients' VATsystems, a whole culture of VAT expertise had developed at the firm.andP;  Thenormal modus operandi was the ubiquitous questionnaires, but now thisquestionnaire took on a new significance--an error would mean heavymisdeclaration penalties.andM;Eandamp;Y was faced with a dilemma.andP;  VAT rules were complex and flued; should theytake on more VAT specialists?andP;  Or should they try to find a way to make thisspecialized expertise available to anyone?andP;  they decided to enact the secondoption.andP;  Christine Tindall, a senior manager in the U.K.andO;computer-development department, set out to create an expert VAT system, andVAT Intelligent Assistant (VATIA) was born.andM;The hardware-software selection criteria was based on two crucial caveats.andO;The software had to run a microbased system, the platform of choice for otheraudit software; and the run-time system's cost had to be reasonable sincemore than 600 PCs would be outfitted with the final product.andP;  Using theexpert-system tool Crystal from Intelligent Environments, of Tewksbury,Mass., Tindall's team set out to codify the essence of the VAT audit process.andO;One former customs inspector, now the firm, provided the raw expertise to befused into the system.andP;  This expert was supported by the head of the VATgroup and his group of six specialists.andM;Value-added tax accounting is not as simple as it sounds.andP;  The process is afusion of legal, accounting, and audit expertise.andP;  Add a layer ofcustoms-practices knowledge and a bit of commercial experience and you haveone meaty knowledge requirement.andM;The system was divided into seven discrete components: registration, returns,output tax, input tax, partial exemption, records and other.andP;  Similar toother audit expert systems, VATIA guides the user through the intricate worldof VAT law and regulations in a tailored-to-the client manner.andM;A consultation with VATIA takes about two hours.andP;  At the end of the processfour typical audit reports can be generated: management letter pointing outkey issues, areas where immediate action is required, key points for theauditor to note, and general client notes.andP;  In May 1988 VATIA was distributedto the far reaches of the Eandamp;Y empire where it now graces the PC of the veryproper British auditor.andM;ARTHUR ANDERSEN andamp; CO.andM;Probably few of the Big Six accounting firms are as visible in AI as ArthurAndersen.andP;  Since the early 1980s, it has dabbled in, dallied over, anddesigned some heavy-duty expert systems.andP;  Like Peat, Arthur Andersen realizedearly the value of developing an expert-system approach to analyzing mortgageloans.andP;  Its version of the system, called the Mortgage Loan Analyzer (MLA),was developed on the PC using one of the more popular expert-system toolsets,ADS from Aion Corp. of Paolo Alto, Calif.andP;  MLA uses some 200 data elements toevaluate and draw a conclusion about a particular mortgage.andP;  Acting in anadvisory capacity, MLA asks the loan officer questions that often requiresubjective answers.andP;  MLA produces a final report and the loan officer canaccept or decline the advice.andP;  Regardless of the outcome, the loan officerdocuments the decision to MLA; in this way MLA learns and grows.andM;Arthur Andersen probably has the broadest experience of any of the Big Six inthe area of expert systems.andP;  They've been involved in automated customerservice, credit cards, oil and gas systems, and even one for the Securitiesand Exchange Commission (SEC).andM;SEC receives well over 10 million pages of written material a year: if SEC'sstaff were to work 365 days a year they would have to read a mere 27,397pages a day.andP;  So what's a poor SEC regulator to do?andM;Enter EDGAR, which stands for Electronic Data Gathering and Analysis andRetrieval system.andP;  Firms will file their data electronically via an onlineEDGAR terminal, magnetic tape or floppy disk.andP;  EDGAR speaks fluidword-processing, up to 85 different dialects.andP;  IT's not EDGAR's voraciousappetite for documents, but its super-sleuth prowess that makes jaded AIaficionados take notice.andM;And here's where Arthur Andersen enters the picture.andP;  Combining the cream ofAI concepts, Financial Statement Analyzer (FSA) takes the narrow domain offinacial-statement data and turns it into knowledge.andP;  The world of financialanalysis is necessarily limited to such nonesoteric concepts as assets,accounts receivable, liabilities, and stockholders equity.andP;  This hierarchicalstructure is also a natural AI network enabling logical inheritance from theaccount level (assets) to the subaccount (current assets).andP;  Object-orientedcoding fits the hierarchical FSA structure like a glove fits a hand.andP;  UsingIntelliCorp's (of Mountain View, Calif.) KEE software tool, each accountingconcept within the chosen prototype domains of balance sheet and incomestatement was defined as an object.andP;  assets is an object, as are its childrencurrent assets, property and equipment, and other assets.andM;Each FSA object has one function and one function only--find yourself.andO;According to Bruce B. Johnson, partner at Arthur Andersen (the consultingfirm whose AI expertise was enlisted for the prototype), the find yourselffunction is done by looking through the input document and intelligentlyanalyzing the captions or labels it finds.andP;  A text analyzer was developed toparse the free-form fortnotes.andP;  All values are found and passed up to thehighest-level object where ratios can then be calculated.andM;FSA, which runs on a LISP machine, offers financial analysts an interactivesession.andP;  After choosing a company and a year to work on, the system candispaly any of the firm's documents on the workstation screen.andP;  At thispoint, the analyst can invoke the ratio calculations.andP;  Several are available,such as the quick ratio used a measure a firm's ability to satisfy short-termobligations without resorting to inventory sale, and the debt-to-equityratio, a common measure to determine how much of a firm has been financed byshort-term debt.andM;To perform these calculations FSA interprets line-item captions even thoughthey may be listed many different ways.andP;  FSA understands the caption withinthe contextual meaning of a section of the statement.andP;  For example, a captionsuch as other may be recognized to mean other receivables or other assets.andO;If a particular caption cannot be found, FSA is smart enough to takealternative measures.andP;  If current assets is not found, FSA sums its componentsubaccounts cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivables, inventories, andprepaid expenses.andP;  FSA uses the natural-language parser to understand highlydetailed footnotes and parenthetical notes.andP;  FSA can scan these notes andcalculate an adjustment.andM;Sadly, this comprehensive and powerful financial analyzer is not included inthe first round of EDGAR being developed by the SEC.andP;  Let's hope FSA getsincluded in round two of EDGAR.andM;WHERE THEY'RE HEADEDandM;All of the Big Six are delving into AI.andP;  For them it's matter not only ofpracticality but of competitive advantage.andP;  These companies are fiercelycompetitive; if AI is the goose that lays the golden egg, you can be sureeven the most resistant to technological change will soon follow the BigSix's lead.andM;The Big Six will be using AI on both sides of their business, accounting andconsulting.andP;  I've already speculated about accounting, which will be theirinitial foray into expert systems.andP;  In the domain of consulting they willemploy expert technologies both for planning and performing the consultingtask.andP;  A large part of consulting is dependent upon client-staff interview.andO;Expert systems will ensure that interviewers ask consistent and in-depthquestions.andP;  Because these consulting firms handle similar types of consultingproblems and issues from client firm to client firm, this broad base ofgeneral and industry specific knowledge can be encoded into a masterknowledge base.andP;  This knowledge base can be used to great advantage bypermitting expert systematizing of knowledge into a smart consulting scope inthe same way the auditing scope is performed now.andM;The Big Six will also profit by selling the expert systems they develop.andP;  Thecompanies are already beginning to move in this direction (Peat Marwick isreadying Loan Probe for market).andP;  I don't know if Coopers andamp; Lybrand isconsidering the same tack, but I predict there would be a very large marketfor FFAST.[R]andM;The combination of accounting and consulting skill is what sets the Big Sixapart from the rest of the herd; this high level of expertise also sets theirexpert-system efforts apart.andP;  More and more companies are finding that theyjust don't have the expertise in-house to create these smarter systems.andP;  Ifthe Big Six can accelerate their efforts in commercializing theirexpert-system experiences, they will find a big and grateful market.andM;Jessica Keyes is president of New Art Inc., a New York, N.Y., firmspecializing in high-technology applications for business problems.andP;  She is afrequent contributor to many technical publications and teaches a seminarcalled &quot;Getting Started in Expert Systems.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
