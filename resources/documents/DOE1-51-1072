Remains of organisms of the swamp communities consist of bacteriaand fungi; algae; invertebrates such as pelecypods, gastropods, ostracodes,and insects; vertebrates such as a hard-shelled turtle and crocodiles;and vascular plant remains. Aquatic communities are found in dark shaleand are represented by the remains of bacteria and fungi; algae; invertebratessuch as pelecypods, gastropods, and insects; and vertebrates such ascrocodiles, fish, and a soft-shelled turtle. No vascular macrophytes(rooted aquatic vegetation) could be identified in the pollen and sporeassemblage. Charophytes are abundant and show that colonies of the aquaticalga lived on the lake bottoms. The great variety of organisms suggeststhat the environment had a high input of nutrients. The phosphate-richPhosphoria Formation, which could serve as a good source of nutrients,cropped out in the watershed of the Niland Tongue basin. The ostracode-crocodileassociation, calcareous charophytes, and good preservation of plant tissuesand palynomorphs put limits on the alkaline geochemical environment inwhich the lacustrine rocks were deposited. The palynomorphs in the NilandTongue rocks are dark yellow and light brown in color. These colors suggestthat rocks containing them have been buried deeper in the past than theyare today.</TEXT></DOC>
