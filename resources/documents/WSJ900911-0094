With 524 stores located in middle-class marketsthroughout the West and across the Sunbelt to Texas andFlorida, his company is well placed to keep growing in the1990s.   One key to Albertson's success, however, has been itsquickness to close stores that are fading, Mr. Michael notes.The chain doesn't aim for overall market share but forper-store revenue marks. And although he thinks price issecondary to other factors in keeping his registers humming,Mr. Michael concedes that if any of his shops get caught inan untenable cost trap he will pull the plug pronto.</LP><TEXT>   The prospect, if unlikely, isn't an idle one. Along theWest Coast, Albertson's has joined other chain grocers inrecent months in a series of wage pacts with the United Foodand Commercial Workers (UFCW) to lift the pay of experiencedclerks and butchers to the $12-$15/hour range, with rathergenerous medical plans and vesting of benefits to part-timersworking as little as 16 hours a week. That's fine foreverybody in the industry until a nonunion challengerarrives. Now that day may be here.   Wal-Mart is coming to California, and its food outletscould follow. &quot;Warehouse&quot; sellers such as Costco, PriceSavers and PACE got started in the West offering housewaresnearly a decade ago, and now do a third of their business ingroceries. The discounters are hitting the high-costNortheast markets, too.   Some doubt this will amount to much. Analyst Sarah Stackof Bateman Eichler, Hill Richards in Los Angeles says theseoperators account for just 2% of the supermarket trade, anddoesn't think that will grow much. She agrees withAlbertson's Mr. Michael that convenient location, localidentity and manageable store size appeal more to shoppersthan slashed prices.   To some degree, the grocers have gotten the cost message.Kimberly Walin, a Shearson Lehman analyst, says wagesettlements generally have trailed the cost of living sincethe mid-'80s. At the UFCW's Washington, D.C., offices,William Olwell, executive vice president for collectivebargaining, acknowledges that his union's compensation rateshave met resistance.   The warehouse stores, because they require items to bebought in larger quantities, can't capture most consumers,Mr. Olwell believes. But they're pinching. Sam's (as inWalton) Wholesale Club &quot;has done damage to our employers.&quot;Together with nonunion grocery chains such as fast-growingFood Lion in the South, they're holding UFCW membership fromthe industry to about 800,000 nationwide. Cost pressure was acause of the much-noted Safeway layoffs and pullout fromDallas.   Mr. Olwell says unionization rates are above 90% along theWest Coast. This is abetted by the antitrust-proof practiceof group negotiating by employers (and union locals) invarious regions. Even mainly nonunion entrants to the field,such as Smith's from Utah, which plans 60 huge stores inSouthern California over the next five years, fall in stepand require workers to sign up with the UFCW. This &quot;parity&quot;is fine with Albertson's Mr. Michael, who seems to assent towhat Mr. Olwell says is the UFCW's main goal: &quot;to eliminatewages as a competitive factor.&quot;   Consumers may not endorse that happy arrangement. Mr.Olwell himself says that whereas he &quot;didn't have to worry asmuch&quot; in the 1960s and '70s, when a nonunion operator wouldtypically keep whatever was scrimped from pay or fringes,these days the saving underwrites price wars for whichhigher-paying chains are less suited. (However, he claimsthat in Florida, where the UFCW's situation is a &quot;basketcase,&quot; shoppers are not realizing the gains from wagediscounts he says are 40% off the &quot;normal&quot; rates.)   Other things equal, a higher wage scale will bolsterlongevity in the job -- ideally of employees who pleasecustomers. Management and labor both cite this stability as aplus, comparing grocery help favorably with department-storecashiers whose pay is less and turnover higher. This is whysome nonunion grocers, and even a warehouse chain likeCostco, will at least match union scale. (The biggest of thewarehousers, Price Club of San Diego, has a Teamsterscontract.)   Mr. Michael, whose stores are nonunion away from the WestCoast, says Albertson's succeeds with either type of labor.But he credits having the chain in many low-cost marketareas, as well as minimizing central-office overhead, withits 11%-plus return on average assets.   Still, with costs for its 55,000 employees constituting70% of Albertson's operating expenses (exclusive ofinventory), the union contracts are a potential drag onprofitability. Of the recent West Coast settlements, Mr.Michael says, &quot;We have to get productivity increases out ofthose wage increases. . . . We have to have programs in themeat departments where you cut more, where you bring in thebeef a little differently and you trim it differently.Consumers are not going to let you pass it along.&quot;   He thinks Albertson's can tough it out with Sam Walton'screw if need be. &quot;When it comes to quality and assortment,they can't compete with us,&quot; he says. &quot;They're not going tobe able to sell fresh produce necessarily cheaper than weare. It's not like selling toilet paper. You can't buy ahead.If lettuce freezes in Salinas, their lettuce freezes justlike ours does.&quot;   If outsiders are to penetrate rich marketplaces such asCalifornia, they will probably do best on urban outskirts.Land costs in established areas are so high that finding asite there and then trying to draw customers away fromestablished chains is considered a longshot.   Once blessed with a desirable address, the modernsupermarket tries to provide &quot;one-stop shopping&quot; for dailyneeds, food or otherwise. By typically offering four timesthe selection of items to be found in a low-cost &quot;warehouse,&quot;the UFCW's Mr. Olwell says, the full-service chain store canretain customers who don't want to shuttle shop.   We'll see. The warehouse stores, even with a cumbersomemembership arrangement, have boosted sales to $20 billionfrom $1 billion in 1984. In 1988 the trade journalSupermarket News found they offered more than a 14% savingson food items. No wonder the UFCW is trying to organize them.(Even if they pay according to scale, however, their leanstaffing is going to bleed the union.)   Grocery wage and benefit levels in much of the country area service-sector anomaly. Without commensurately higheroutput they cannot be sustained, even in a cartelizedbargaining setup, unless consumers are prepared to pay extrafor whatever service or convenience premium is involved. Todate, most have been willing to do that, but their choicesare widening. If economic hard times are visited on the broadmiddle class, they may choose another checkstand.</TEXT></DOC>
