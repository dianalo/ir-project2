Milken more than $100 million for work he didlast year, sources said Wednesday.   The provision barring Drexel from paying its former junk bondtrader his 1988 compensation was included in the investment firm'sformal settlement of criminal securities fraud charges brought bythe government.   The withholding of pay has been controversial because Milken hasnot been charged with committing any wrongdoing during 1988. Milkenhas challenged the provision in U.S. District Court in Manhattan.   Sources familiar with the case, who asked not to be named, saidprosecutors have not made a final decision on whether to let Drexelpay Milken his compensation, which court documents place at wellover $100 million.   But they indicated a reversal may be made because legal expertshave criticized the provision as potentially unconstitutional andthe government may not want to start its case against Milken beforeU.S. District Judge Kimba Wood off on the wrong foot.   They said ending the lengthy delay of Drexel's plea in the casewas not a factor in reconsidering the payment provision.   Spokesmen for Drexel and Milken declined to comment.   Assistant U.S. Attorney John Carroll said: ``When and if we makea decision with regard to any matters in these cases, we will tellthem to Judge Wood before we tell them to anyone else.''   The government has indicated the money was ordered withheld ongrounds it was improper for Drexel to settle criminal charges whileit was paying millions to the employee allegedly responsible forillegal activity.   Drexel agreed in December to pay $650 million and plead guilty tosix felonies for violating securities laws, charges that stemmedfrom the Ivan Boesky insider trading case. The plea has been held upby a series of legal issues related to Milken, the last of which washis challenge to the pay requirement.   Milken was charged in March in a 98-count indictment withracketeering and fraud related to securities transactions. Hepleaded innocent and is scheduled to go to trial in March.   A U.S. District Court hearing is scheduled for Sept. 6 onMilken's arguments that the pay provision deprived him ofconstitutional due process. Milken has resigned from Drexel and setup his own financial consulting firm.   Under a separate settlement with the Securities and ExchangeCommission, Drexel and its employees are barred from doing businesswith Milken and his brother, Lowell, who also is charged by thegovernment.   The Milkens were not party to the firm's SEC settlement, which isto take effect after Drexel enters its criminal plea.   Drexel this week issued a three-sentence memo reminding itsemployees they cannot advise corporate clients if Milken also isadvising them.   ``While employees of Drexel Burnham may have purely socialcontact with them, business matters that do or could involve DrexelBurnham are not to be discussed,'' read the memo signed by DrexelChief Executive Frederick Joseph.   Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said the memo was issued becausethe firm is ``determined to live within the spirit of the (SEC)agreement in the absence of its finalization.''</TEXT></DOC>
