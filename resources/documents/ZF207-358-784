 The original standard, published in 1985, describes10M-bits-per-second transmission over 50-ohm coaxial cable and is based uponthe Ethernet standard adopted by Xerox, Digital Equipment and Intel.andP;  Thatversion of the IEEE 802.3 standard is known as Type 10BASE5, since itdescribes 10M-bits-per-second baseband transmission over coaxial cablesegments that are no longer than 500 meters (1,640 feet).andM;Several supplements to the IEEE 802.3 standard were published in early 1988.andO;They describe 10M-bits-per-second baseband transmission over 185 meter (607feet) segments of 50-ohm coaxial cable (Type 10BASE2, aka Cheapernet),1M-bits-per-second baseband transmission over unshielded twisted pair (Type1BASE5, based on ATandamp;T's Starlan), and 10M-bits-per-second broadbandtransmission over 75-ohm coaxial cable (Type 10BROAD36).andP;  Proposed newadditions to the IEEE 802.3 family will support high speed transmission overtwisted pair (Type 10BASE-T) and optical fiber (Type 10BASE-F).andM;This article describes the 10BASE-T standard, which will support10M-bits-per-second baseband transmission over the same unshielded twistedpair (UTP) wire that is commonly used for telephone applications.andM;BackgroundandM;10BASE-T fervor really gained speed in the fall of 1987.andP;  In July 1987,Hewlett-Packard (HP) formally requested that the IEEE 802.3 committee set astandard for 10M-bits-per-second transmission over unshielded twisted pair.andO;By the summer of 1987, several CSMA/CD LAN products supported1M-bits-per-second transmission over UTP and Type 1BASE5 had already beenstandardized by the 802.3 committee.andP;  Now, vendors were beginning to designand build products supporting 10M-bits-per-second CSMA/CD over UTP and theneed for a standard became evident.andM;By the end of 1987, there were proposals for 10BASE-T standards from fourdifferent camps.andP;  One proposal came from Digital Equipment (DEC) and 3Comusing a single twisted pair.andP;  The other three proposals used two twistedpairs -- one for transmit and one for receive.andP;  One proposal was made byChipcom (Waltham, MA) and RAD Network Devices (Rochelle Park, NJ), a secondby David Systems (Sunnyvale, CA), and a third, called the &quot;AUI (AttachmentUnit Interface) approach,&quot; was supported by ATandamp;T, HP, Interlan (Boxborough,MA), SynOptics (Mountain View, CA), Ungermann-Bass (Santa Clara, CA), WangLaboratories (Lowell, MA), and Western Digital (Irvine, CA).andP;  The AUIapproach was based upon an HP proposal to the 802.3 committee in August 1987.andM;The various proposals went through a number of iterations.andP;  In early 1988,DEC and 3Com (Santa Clara, CA) had proposed a new scheme using two twistedpairs instead of one; by March, DEC, 3Com, and David Systems had withdrawntheir proposals.andP;  Finally, on March 17, 1988, all factions embraced the AUIapproach.andM;While the committee adopted the AUI approach, it should be noted that theydid not adopt any one company's product, as some marketing literature tendsto suggest.andP;  This is an important distinction.andP;  Standards committees rarely,if ever, adopt a product by name, although they may adopt a specificcompany's strategy.andP;  SynOptics, for example, has placed over 10,000 LattisNetnodes over unshielded twisted pairs using a strategy similar to the AUIapproach, though not the same.andP;  The AUI approach, not a specific product, isbeing standardized.andM;In March 1988, the 10BASE-T task group was given permission by the IEEE 802.3committee to initiate the draft process that would allow them to progresstheir work into a new standard.andP;  Meeting every month or two since then, the10BASE-T group hopes to have a final draft of the standard later this yearand an official new supplement to the IEEE 802.3 standard by early 1990.andM;The first draft of the 10BASE-T standard was released in May 1988.andP;  Thecurrent version is Draft D (February 1989), which is being circulated to theentire IEEE 802.3 committee.andP;  New drafts or revisions are appearing everycouple of months.andM;The new standard, when complete, will fully describe the electricalcharacteristics, signaling, medium attachment and media specifications forthe Type 10BASE-T CSMA/CD local area network.andP;  While the generalities of thestandard will probably not change, specifics may change quite significantly;there are still a number of issues to be finalized.andM;Requirements of the StandardandM;The requirements of the Type 10BASE-T standard may be stated quite simply:the standard is to describe a CSMA/CD network that operates at a speed of 10Mbits per second over an unshielded twisted pair medium and provideselectrical isolation between the pairs.andM;More broadly, a Type 10BASE-T network has to satisfy the followingconditions:andM;* It must operate at 10M bits per second over 0.4-0.6 mm (26-22 AWG)unshielded twisted pair link segments up to 100 meters (328 feet) long.andM;* It must be able to use low cost connectors and devices.andM;* It must have less than 1 bit error every 100 million bits.andM;* It must coexist with other services offered over other twisted pairs in thesame cable bundle, including analog and digital voice, Type 1BASE5, LANs,ISDN, EIA-232-D, EIA-422-A and EIA-423-A.andP;  (25-pair bundles are commonly usedfor telephone cable distribution.)andM;* It must be able to tolerate near-end crosstalk from other 10BASE-Tconnections.andM;* It must be able to operate over in-place telephone wiring and take intoaccount different types of wiring, cable connectors and punch-down connectorblocks.andM;* It should be compatible with other IEEE 802.3 standards, notably the Type10BASE5, Type 10BASE2 and repeater specifications.andM;* It should use cable installable by telephone technicians; the MediumAttachment Unit (MAU) and stations should be connectable by users withminimal technical expertise.andM;* It should provide the same automatic media and Physical Medium Attachment(PMA) fault detection as in Type 10BASE2 and 10BASE5 MAUs.andM;The Type 10BASE-T specification will not be a new standalone standard.andO;Instead, it will be added as Section 14 to the current IEEE 802.3 standard.andO;This reinforces the concept of 802.3 as family of CSMA/CD standards that caninteroperate.andM;10BASE-T TopologyandM;Figure 1 shows the basic star topology proposed for a Type 10BASE-T network.andO;This is similar to the topology used by Type 1BASE5 (i.e.andP;  Starlan) andoptical fiber-based CSMA/CD networks.andM;Most readers are familiar with CSMA/CD bus networks (Ethernet), wherestations passively tap onto a shared bus.andP;  There is no contradiction to aCSMA/CD LAN using a physical star topology.andP;  In this scheme, all devices areattached to a central hub which contains a repeater.andP;  Whenever a stationtransmits, its signal is received at the hub, where the incoming transmissionis broadcast back out on all output lines.andP;  In this way, the network has alogical bus topology since it acts like a simultaneous broadcast network.andO;Furthermore, a station is able to detect collisions and can stoptransmitting, if necessary.andP;  A station may be attached to the MediumAttachment Unit (MAU) by an Attachment Unit Interface (AUI) cable.andP;  The AUIcable is 15-wire cable, terminating at the station and MAU with a 15-pinsubminiature connector (DB-15).andP;  AUI cable may be up to 50 meters (164 feet)in length.andP;  The AUI cable itself is optional; the AUI function and station'sMAU may both be part of the station's network interface board.andM;The Multiport Repeater Set (MRS) acts as a concentrator (or hub)interconnecting network stations and/or other MRS units.andP;  The MRS contains aRepeater Unit and some number of MAU ports.andP;  Network stations attach to theMRS via the MAU ports, and the repeater unit broadcasts an incomingtransmission out to all stations.andM;The MAU ports are interconnected using an unshielded twisted pair LinkSegment that is no longer than 100 meters (328 feet) in length.andP;  The LinkSegment terminates at both MAUs with an eight-pin RJ-45 modular connector(the same as in Type 1BASE5).andM;The proposed contact connections for the RJ-45 connector in Type 10BASE-Tnetworks is similar to that for Type 1BASE5 networks.andP;  Note that a LinkSegment comprises four wires (two twisted pairs).andP;  The configuration for theRJ-45's eight connectors is:andM;1 -- Transmit Data + (TD+) 2 -- Transmit Data--(TD-) 3 -- Receive Data +(RD+) 4 -- not used by 10BASE-T 5 -- not used by 10BASE-T 6 -- ReceiveData--(RD-) 7 -- not used by 10BASE-T 8 -- not used by 10BASE-TandM;The TD+ and TD- pins at one MAU are connected to the RD+ and RD- pins,respectively, at the other MAU.andP;  This crossover function must be implementedin every 10BASE-T Link Segment; its purpose is similar to the use of a nullmodem cable when connecting EIA-232-D devices.andM;As in the Type 1BASE5 standard, this connector assignment scheme leaves spareconnections for support of other services over the same four-pair bundle.andM;Early drafts of the 10BASE-T standard also supplied a specific scheme for theuse of 50-pin connectors when using 25-pair cable bundles.andP;  This MultipointLine Interface Connector was proposed for connecting multiple 10BASE-T portsto a repeater.andP;  Multipair connections are not in the latest draft of theproposed 10BASE-T standard, although it is discussed elsewhere in the 802.3standard.andM;The star wiring configuration of a Type 10BASE-T network is well-suited formany applications.andP;  For example, the MRS could be located in the telephonewiring closet.andP;  Two twisted pairs could connect the MRS to a data jack in anindividual's office; an AUI cable or 4-wire phone cord could attach the LANstation to the data outlet.andP;  A third pair from the wiring closet could beused for the telephone jack connection (or a third and fourth pair for ISDN).andM;The 328-foot maximum length for the Link Segment is not a severe limitation.andO;Some ATandamp;T studies suggest that over 90% of the telephones in the businessenvironment are located within 225 feet of the wiring closet.andP;  This suggeststhat most PCs are located well within the distance limitations of thisstandard.andM;Maximum SizeandM;The constraint on the maximum physical size of a CSMA/CD network dependsprimarily on the propagation delay of signals through the network.andP;  TheCSMA/CD scheme requires that the maximum propagation delay across the networkbe very small, thus reducing the duration of the contention interval.andP;  (Thecontention interval is the maximum amount of time during which a collisioncan occur and represents, then, the maximum amount of time that can be lostdue to a collision.)andP;  Large contention intervals can allow collisions to goundetected for a relatively large period of time, dramatically degradingperformance.andM;Different media types have different delay characteristics; therefore, theuse of different media will result in different maximum configurations ofCSMA/CD networks.andP;  The IEEE 802.3 standard describes the maximum allowabledelays and maximum configurations using different media types.andM;Some actual examples might be helpful to illustrate this idea.andP;  The speed oflight (c) in a vacuum is 186,000 miles per second (300,000 km per sec), orroughly 1 foot per nanosecond.andP;  (A nanosecond is one one-billionth of asecond.)andP;  Type 10BASE5 networks use 50-ohm coaxial cable with an assumedpropagation velocity of no less than 77% of the speed of light (0.77c).andP;  Type10BASE2 coaxial cable and AUI cable have an assumed propagation velocity of.65c minimum.andP;  Unshielded twisted pair has an assumed propagation velocity ofat least 0.59c, while optical fiber link segments have an assumed propagationvelocity of no less than 0.66c.andP;  Obviously, networks built using differentmedia will propagate signals at different rates.andM;The Type 10BASE-T standard describes the relationship between twisted pairsegments, Type 10BASE5 and 10BASE2 coaxial segments, optical fiber segmentsand the maximum number of repeaters.andP;  Maximum configurations depend upon themaximum delays in the network.andP;  A mix of media types are also allowed.andM;The lower portion of Figure 2 shows one possible maximum configuration usinga combination of twisted pair and coaxial cable.andP;  This network comprises twoAUI segments (50 meters), two unshielded twisted pair Link Segments (100meters), three Coaxial Segments (500 meters in Type 10BASE5, 185 meters inType 10BASE2), and four repeaters (in the MRS).andP;  The maximum separationbetween Stations 1 and 2 is 1,800 meters (5,905 feet) with Type 10BASE5 mediaor 855 meters (2,805 feet) with Type 10BASE2 media.andM;The top portion of Figure 2 shows another possible maximum configuration,utilizing two AUI segments (50 meters), two UTP Link Segments (100 meters),two Fiber Segments (1 km), and three repeaters.andP;  The maximum separationbetween Stations 1 and 2 in this configuration is 2,300 meters (7,546 feet).andM;Other configurations and combinations of transmission media are certainlypossible.andP;  Specifications in the 10BASE-T standard provide a user withsufficient information to determine the appropriate cable segment lengths andmaximum number of repeaters for a variety of applications.andM;ConclusionandM;This article describes work still in progress, not a published standard.andP;  Sofar, we have only discussed the (relatively) non-controversial aspects and,therefore, the more static parts of the specification; electrical and signalcharacteristics appear to be the major areas that need finalizing at thistime.andP;  However, it should be clear where this new standard will fit into theCSMA/CD LAN family and how it might relate to your own applications andneeds.andM;Many companies already sell CSMA/CD products that operate at 10M bits persecond over unshielded twisted pair.andP;  Some of these products include: ATandamp;T(Morristown, NJ): Starlan 10 David Systems (Sunnyvale, CA): David InformationManager Digital Equipment Corp. (Merrimack, NH): DECNet Hewlett-Packard (Ft.andO;Collins, CO): Starlan 10 Intel Corp.
