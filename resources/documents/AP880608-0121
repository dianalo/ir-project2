He said the administration will beginworking quickly with Congress on another version.   ``Our discussions with the Congress indicate that a number ofmembers would like to have a trade bill _ Democrat and Republican _that they feel it's important for the country, as well aspolitically, and the committee leadership certainly is interestedin a bill,'' said Fitzwater.   ``I think there is a growing body that feels like a trade billis needed and can be passed,'' he added.   Some, such as Sen. John Heinz, R-Pa., a strong supporter of thebill, say they still think a version acceptable to Reagan can befashioned this session.   Senate Majority Leader Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said Tuesdaythat the bill's ``pulse is still beating,'' but there was nothinghe could do to budge perhaps 36 senators prepared to sustainReagan's veto.   Byrd told reporters there was still hope that home-statepressures would change a few minds at the last minute.   The House already has voted to override Reagan's veto. Senatefailure to follow suit could doom trade legislation for the rest of1988 and send some administration loyalists into fall campaignswith an Achilles heel on the issue.   ``This veto is going to be used as a political issue this year;we all know that,'' Heinz warned his colleagues.   Some administration supporters clearly would like another crackat the issue before November. The administration has been urging ascaled-down bill that would win the president's support. But Byrdhas been warning that a fres bill would be peppered with amendmentsand could become hopelessly bogged down.   The bill's chief provisions would overhaul the system underwhich the government imposes import curbs to aid U.S. industriesand retaliate against international trade violations.   Other features range from a potential $2 billion in agriculturalsubsidies to repeal of the windfall profits tax on oil-industryearnings.   Reagan's May 24 veto focused on a provision that would requirecompanies with 100 employees or more to provide their workers with60-day notice of plant closings and large-scale layoffs. He saidthe provision would take away too much management flexibility.Reagan also was critical of restrictions in the bill on Alaskan oilexports.   A two-thirds majority is needed in Congress to override apresidential veto. The bill's backers failed to gain that when theSenate passed the bill 63-36 on April 27, and the lawmakersappeared to remain frozen in the positions they took then.   The only Democrat to oppose the measure was retiring Sen.William Proxmire, D-Wis., who has fought provisions that wouldrelax the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   Obtaining criminal convictions of businessmen for overseaspayoffs would become more difficult because of the changes.``That's why I call it the bring-back-bribery bill,'' Proxmire saidTuesday.   As debate began, Heinz said the political potential of the issueshould not prompt lawmakers to give up on trying to fashion a billthat Reagan would sign.   ``Anybody can just sit in the stands and boo the umpire,'' hesaid. ``If there's a chance to pull this game out _ albeit in extrainnings _ we should at least take our last at bats.''   Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, R-Kan., said getting anothertrade bill through this year might take an agreement that would baramendments. He said there was precedent for doing that butindicated it still might be difficult.   ``If the president's veto is sustained,'' said Sen. AlanCranston, D-Calif., ``it may be a long, long time before we getanother chance to pass a comprehensive trade bill. Don't let anyonetell you that it will be as simple as passing the same trade billwithout the plant-closing provision to which the presidentobjects.''   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., told lawmakers that Reagan'sveto could be ``described only as a triumph of ideology overfairness and good sense.''   ``Will we give America's workers 60 days notice of plantclosings and mass layoffs?'' Kennedy said. ``Or will we allow themto be treated like chattel, thrown onto the street when businesshas no further use for them?''   Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, however, said the plant-closingsprovision could hurt advertising agencies and other companiesdependent on contracts that can be canceled suddenly. He said thatin such cases, the businesses might have to keep hundreds of highlypaid employees on the payroll without any work to do.   ``I'm a believer in the adage,'' Grassley said, ``if it ain'tbroke, don't fix it.''</TEXT></DOC>
