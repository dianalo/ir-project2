Statistical figures are given forgrowth of electricity consumption, structure of power plant capacity,reduction in specific fuel consumption for electricity production, structureof prime energy consumption (coal, oil, gas, water and nuclear energy)and development of fuel transportation distances from 1960 to 1980. Energypolicy from 1985 to the year 2,000 is outlined. Production of 3,000 x10{sup 9}kWh in the year 2000, double the figure for 1985, is planned.In 1990, planned coal production will reach 780 to 800 Mt, crude oil625 to 640 Mt and natural gas 835 to 850 x 10{sup 9}m{sup 3}. Power plantconstruction, design and efficiency, along with cost of electricity generationare evaluated. Aspects also include development of district heating energylosses, use of solar and geothermal energy and the increase in nuclearpower generation. 32 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
