Gorbachev's reform in the Soviet Union, expertssay.   It was the basket-case Soviet economy, rather than a change inReagan's unstintingly harsh rhetoric after his first term, thatimpelled the changes brought about by Gorbachev since early 1985,these experts said.   Reagan talked very tough about the Soviet Union from 1981 through1984, at least in part to build on his perceived election mandate torebuild America's defenses.   Several scholars and analysts said in interviews, however, thatReagan should now be applauded for recognizing the opportunityafforded by Gorbachev's policies.   Reagan, they said, moved quickly to re-establish the kind ofworking U.S.-Soviet relationship that had been virtually scrappedafter the Red Army's invasion of Afghanistan in 1979.   For his part, Reagan said last week that he wasn't trying to takecredit for Gorbachev's reforms.   ``I cannot, tonight, attempt to put all these events inperspective, or still less, to claim credit for any person oradministration,'' the president told reporters Thursday at perhapshis final news conference.   Yet, Reagan, in his weekly radio address on Saturday, took somecredit for the changed U.S.-Soviet relationship, saying, ``Oursteadfastness, our policies, our whole approach has borne fruit.''   The president pointed to his administration's adherence todemocratic values, its criticism of human rights violations in theSoviet Union, and its military buildup for helping bring about thechanges.   Reagan never met with a Soviet leader until he and Gorbachev satdown in Geneva in November 1985. After that, they held four more,including the turbulent talks in Reykjavik, Iceland in October 1986,along with summits in Washington, Moscow and Wednesday's luncheonsummit on Governors Island in New York Harbor.   Paul Weyrich, chairman of the Free Congress Educational andResearch Foundation, a strategic affairs analyst and one of Reagan'slongtime conservative backers, charged that the president had beenovercome by sentiment in his dealings with Gorbachev.   ``Originally, I thought the administration ws dealing with theSoviets through strength, but now we have a president who actuallybelieves, probably influenced by Nancy (Reagan) and others, that hecan actually make peace with Gorbachev, as if Gorbachev were anindividual, popularly elected, like himself, and not a part of a(different) system,'' Weyrich said.   ``Gorbachev could be replaced tomorrow, and there we would be,holding the bag,'' he said.   ``I think the major accomplishment of Ronald Reagan is not somuch having affected Soviet policy in significant ways, butbasically that he, in his person, has made arms control andnegotiating with the Soviets legitimate again, especially withregard to the (conservative) right,'' said Neil McFarlane, anassociate professor in the Government and Foreign Affairs Departmentat the University of Virginia.   McFarlane said that Gorbachev's moves were to some extent spurredby U.S. policies, particularly American assistance to the rebelsfighting the Soviet-imposed government in Afghanistan, where theSoviets now are withdrawing their forces.   But he said for the most part U.S. actions ``have been more orless incidental'' to changes in the Soviet Union. Gorbachev quicklyrecognized that the Soviet Union wouldn't survive as a world powerif it did not correct problems in the economy, he said.   Raymond L. Garthoff, a senior fellow at the liberal-orientedBrookings Institution, said, ``I think he (Reagan) should be givencredit for recognizing change on the Soviet side, but certainly thatchange hasn't been determined by the hard policies he pursued duringhis first term.''   Alexander Dollin, a professor at Stanford University's Center forRussian and East European Studies, said, ``As I see it, the reasonswhy Gorbachev came to power and followed a reform program at homeand abroad had nothing to do with Ronald Reagan.''   ``If another (Leonid) Brezhnev had come to power instead of aGorbachev, things would have been very different, and the Reaganadministration would have had nothing to take credit for,'' he said.   Bill Taylor, vice president for political and military affairs atthe Center for Strategic and International Studies, said during theReagan years, the Soviets ``at least rhetorically have madechanges.'' But he said that ``his orians may only tell years fromnow'' what impact Reagan had on this change.   ``The Reagan backers will attribute it to the foreign policy andthe defense buildup,'' Taylor said. ``Others to the moderate centerand the left (wing) will question that. The far left will deny it.''</TEXT></DOC>
