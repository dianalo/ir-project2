The statement released by the airline was the firstindication of United's reaction to the hefty package ofincentives -- totaling about $325 million -- offered byColorado and Denver.   The airline said it will put its reservations center atStapleton Airport, which will become an industrial park afterthe opening of Denver's new airport in late 1993. About 2,000employees will work at the center, the airline said.</LP><TEXT>   But the company said it hasn't yet chosen Denver as thesite of the maintenance center, citing &quot;significant&quot; concernswith the $150 million incentive package passed by thelegislature last weekend.   Gov. Roy Romer has already asked the Colorado SupremeCourt to rule on the constitutionality of the package. Thestate's constitution disallows special legislation benefitingone company.   But United said its concerns go beyond the legal questionand include terms of the legislation and the value of thedeal.   The city council earlier this week passed a $175 millionincentive package of its own. That deal was contingent on anagreement by United to locate 45 gates at the new airport,locate its reservations center at Stapleton and bring themaintenance center to Denver.</TEXT></DOC>
