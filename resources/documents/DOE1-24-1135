Lack of information on the part of building managers and financialinstitutions, a need for ongoing, intensive assistance by governments,complex procurement procedures and regulations, and the number of smallprojects with high transaction costs are all reasons why performancecontracting has not been used to a greater extent in New York and elsewhere.Seven subsectors have been identified within the public and publiclyassisted building sector. They include elementary and secondary schools,universities colleges, municipal governments, hospitals, public carefacilities, state office buildings and public housing. The total potentialinvestment for energy efficiency projects in these subsectors is approximately$2 billion. In its initial years of operation, OEF should target universities,colleges and State-owned facilities, because projects in these subsectorsare likely to be larger, easier to implement and will enable the Stateto test the need for the creation of the Corporation for Energy Financing.In examining institutional structures capable of offering the servicesdescribed above, it was determined that most of the services could beprovided through a pilot program at the Energy Authority, in coordinationwith other state agencies such as the State Energy Office.</TEXT></DOC>
