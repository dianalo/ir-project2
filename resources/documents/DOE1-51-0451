Additionally,the report recognizes that many other technologies need to be developedand used to advance the nation's competitive position. Bringing thesetechnologies to market is primarily a private-sector responsibility.The Federal government is not necessarily in a position to determinewhich technologies are best, or to fund their commercialization. However,in order for the private sector to perform most competitively in theworld market, government needs to establish an institutional and policyframework conducive to such performance. To this end, we believe thatthere are four steps that DOE can undertake now. DOE can work to establisha stable planning environment. DOE can encourage new, non-Federal institutionsto develop and commercialize new energy technology. DOE can provide thenecessary incentives, and remove the disincentives, to private-sectoraction. Finally, DOE can encourage environmental policies that enhanceenergy competitiveness. 46 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
