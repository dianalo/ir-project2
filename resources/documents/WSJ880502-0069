The jury members apparently based their decision on the arguments in a law-review article with the arcane title, &quot;Use of Modern Finance Theory in Securities Fraud Cases Involving Actively Traded Securities.&quot; The jury's message seems plain enough. Pursuers of securities fraud now may have to consider something they've never thought much about -- how markets actually work.    The case arose from the 1982 bankruptcy of Nucorp Energy. Nucorp was one of the first energy firms to go belly up in the oil patch. In 1981, the firm raised $150 million through debentures and a private placement. Within a year, the company was in bankruptcy. The Securities and Exchange Commission obtained consent decrees from the firm's chairman and CFO. The agency claimed that errors in reporting the firm's accounts, not the oil blues, caused investor losses.    Naturally, the institutional investors hired contingency-fee lawyers to sue everyone in sight: Nucorp's officers and directors; its advisers, investment bank Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette; accountant Arthur Andersen; commercial bank Continental, and major shareholder Circle K. Like the SEC, they claimed that alleged misrepresentations of the value of revenues and reserves, and the timing of write-offs, caused them to make what turned out to be bad investments. The officers and directors made a $41 million settlement. But the others decided to fight.    The defendants argued that they weren't responsible for any alleged errors in accounting, but that in any case other factors caused the investors' losses. They called Daniel Fischel, a University of Chicago law-school professor and consultant at Lexecon, the law-and-economics firm founded by Judge Richard Posner. This was a daring move, because past cases showed that if a plaintiff's lawyer could find any uncrossed &quot;t&quot; or undotted &quot;i&quot; in a required disclosure form, his clients would get millions.    Indeed, securities litigation usually depends entirely on hypertechnical disclosure issues and has precious little to do with market realities. At first, Judge Lawrence Irving didn't want Mr. Fischel to testify at all. Judge Irving said, &quot;I have some difficulty understanding how whether this stock was speculative or not has any relevance to any issue in this case.&quot; Judge Irving relented, but told Mr. Fischel to testify &quot;without the use of the 'S' word, speculation.&quot;    Mr. Fischel won the case with economics. He explained the logic of his law-review article, including the efficient-markets hypothesis and its relevance to the case. He described how the highly leveraged and specialized Nucorp could easily, indeed predictably, collapse if the price of oil fell.    The case isn't entirely over. In December Judge Irving issued a default judgment against Donaldson Lufkin when its lawyers failed to produce a witness on time. The result could be an automatic assessment of up to $100 million against the firm. This extraordinary punishment looks especially harsh now that the jury has ruled that damages total $0.    The jury's verdict comes at a most appropriate time. The SEC doesn't understand the market as well as this jury did, yet it now has asked Congress for the power to assess monetary fines on its own for alleged securities violations. We have a better idea.    After his success in San Diego perhaps Mr. Fischel would take on the task of educating the SEC. We may be too optimistic, but if jurors can understand that share prices fall when an industry collapses, maybe the SEC can, too. </TEXT></DOC>
