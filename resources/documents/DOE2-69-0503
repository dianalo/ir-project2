<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-69-0503 </DOCNO><TEXT>Specimens of magnesium-matrix composites with three different types offiber reinforcements (boron, silicon carbide, and 0Kh14N14M2 fibers)were thermally cycled in the temperature range between 150 and -196 Cin a high-purity argon atmosphere. It is found that the magnesium-steelcomposite is characterized by higher resistance to thermal fatigue thancomposites with silicon carbide and boron reinforcements. This resultis explained by the lower thermal expansion coefficient ratio of thestructural components of the magnesium-steel composite and by the higherductility of the steel fibers. 5 references.</TEXT></DOC>
