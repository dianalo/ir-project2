In that case,we consolidated the interpretations and routing regulations into a centrallocation, Part 1004, and removed obsolete matter. In connection with theso-called 1-airline-mile corridor rule (formerly 49 CFR 1041.12), we removedthe prohibition against motor passenger carriers providing service beyondauthorized regular routes within the Washington, DC, commercial zone andgenerally within the New York metropolitan area, in the belief the materialwas obsolete. The American Bus Association filed a petition to reopen, seeking restorationof the exception for metropolitan New York. We have reinstated the NewYork area exception. We expressly indicated in our prior decisions thatno substantive change was intended by the new rules. However, the act ofremoving the New York exception did effect a substantive change. Accordingly,consistent with our overriding original intent, we have restored the exceptionas to the New York metropolitan area.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> June 21, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2><ITAG tagnum="15">Richard L.
