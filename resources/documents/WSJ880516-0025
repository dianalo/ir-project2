The rights are part of a poison-pill provision meant to deter hostile takeovers.    Lucky, based in Dublin, Calif., last month agreed to a leveraged buy-out valued at $61 a share, or $2.35 billion. The grocery chain has given American Stores until tomorrow to top that price. American Stores, based in Salt Lake City, put Lucky into play with an unsolicited bid of $45 a share, or $1.74 billion.    Separately, American Stores said it extended its tender offer for Lucky, despite Lucky's higher buy-out offer, until May 27. American Stores said that 79,223 shares had been tendered under its offer as of Thursday.    In composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange Friday, Lucky shares closed at $61.75, up 25 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
