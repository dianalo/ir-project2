Actually, it benefits from the slight difference of mass whichdistinguishes isotopes of the same element, but a laser beam with a definedwave length may excite selectively one isotope without affecting therest of the isotopes. Then, there is nothing left, but to separate atomsor excited molecules. In principle, isotopic separation by laser indicatessimplicity and efficiency, and its control and development may shortlylead to a fundamental change in nuclear fuel market. 10 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
