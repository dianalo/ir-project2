<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-16-0303 </DOCNO><TEXT>The theory of energetic particle stabilization of ballooning modes intokamaks is revisited. When the energetic particles are drift-reversed,a region of ballooning instability, akin to that which causes the VanDam--Lee--Nelson limit [in Proceedings of the Workshop on EBT Ring Physics(Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Oak Ridge, TN, 1980), p. 471; Phys. Fluids23, 1850 (1980)] in magnetic mirrors, is identified. At higher valuesof core poloidal beta a ''third'' region of stability is conjecturedto occur. The inclusion of finite-aspect-ratio effects can eliminateballooning instability completely when the energetic particles are non-drift-reversed,but the region of instability for drift-reversed particles persists.Requirements for energetic particle stabilization in large- and small-aspect-ratiotokamak experiments and reactors are discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
