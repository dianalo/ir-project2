But while such lags are affectingthe region's ability to attract and carry on business andinvigorate its economy, the problem also is making it perhapsthe world's most exciting market for sellers oftelecommunications equipment.   This year alone, U.S., European and Japanese manufacturerswill reap the bulk of the $20 billion in sales oftelecommunications equipment to the area. And &quot;beyond theyear 2000 is when the real growth is coming,&quot; says RolfGranstrom, managing director of Asian operations for EricssonCommunications (HK) Ltd., a subsidiary of Swedish-basedTelefon AB L.M. Ericsson.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;At that point, the Asian market will be comparable towhat the European market is today.&quot;   For most of the have-not nations, the problem is one ofeconomic growth outpacing the telecommunications systems. Inthe past decade, the Asian-Pacific region has recorded someof the highest growth rates in the world. The average annualrate of 11 Asian countries was 4.7% between 1985 and 1989,and the figure rose to 6% in 1990 alone.   But even with more money in state coffers, tens ofmillions of people in rural areas are cut off from urbancenters, while cities bursting at the seams still rely ontelephone systems installed 30 to 40 years ago.   Recently, in a bid to attract foreign investment,manufacturing and financial institutions, many countries inthe region have made telecommunications systems a nationalpriority. They include Malaysia, Thailand, Taiwan, Indonesiaand the Philippines. &quot;The country that has the besttelecommunications infrastructure will be best-positioned todraw in foreign financial firms,&quot; says N. Ranjan Pal,director of country analysis and forecasting for BusinessInternational Asia/Pacific Ltd., a Hong Kong-based consultingfirm.   In addition, telecommunications development will furtherassist the trade boom within Asia. This intraregional tradenow accounts for 38% of all Asian exports, according to JamesRiedel, an economist at Johns Hopkins University. &quot;Asia,&quot; hesays, &quot;is Asia's largest market for export.&quot;   State-of-the-art telecommunications systems, however, arenot unknown in Asia, and those of Japan, Hong Kong, Singaporeand South Korea can stand comparison with any in the world.The region's telecommunications success stories are allproducts of government regulatory and financial support, buteven so there is some movement toward more competition, whichwould widen the Asian market.   While the bulk of Asian orders are for basic equipment,demand for more-sophisticated gear -- such as fiber-opticcable, digital switches and cellular networks -- is expectedto sustain sales growth for years to come. In Asia &quot;we areexpecting 50% average annual growth in cellular-equipmentsales through 1993,&quot; says Ericsson's Mr. Granstrom. He notes,however, that sales are starting from a relatively low base.   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. officials also see fastgrowth in the cellular market. The cellular business in Asiahas jump-started ATandamp;T's sales figures, says Richard Brandt,regional marketing vice president for ATandamp;T Asia/Pacific Inc.&quot;It's like a license to print money,&quot; he adds.   Because the majority of Asian telecommunications projectsare under either direct or indirect government control, mostof the competition exists between equipment suppliers -- suchas ATandamp;T, Japan's NEC Corp. and Ericsson -- rather thanbetween companies or consortia bidding to build and operatetelecommunications networks within a country.   Despite the great need for modern telecommunicationssystems, these overseas companies find that winning acontract in Asia is tricky business. Often it isn't enough topossess a good product or offer the best price. There's alarge degree of influence peddling and political favoritism.   History is also important. Swedish-based Ericsson, forinstance, has been selling to China for almost 100 years.Ericsson is now one of the leading product suppliers for bothswitching and cellular-phone networks in China. SaysEricsson's Mr. Granstrom: &quot;If you aren't in {China} by now,you're out of luck.&quot;   For overseas groups that don't have the history, jointventures are the next best thing.   In Indonesia, for example, there was a well-publicizedbattle between Japanese and U.S. equipment companies tosupply 700,000 digital switching lines. The hotly contestedcompetition ended in a draw in November 1990 between anATandamp;T-led consortium and a separate NEC and Sumitomo Corp.partnership. Then in January 1991, Perumtel, the statetelephone company, selected two local companies to work withthe two groups -- PT Citra Telekomunikasi Indonesia, with theATandamp;T consortium, and PT Elektrindo Nusantara, with theNEC-Sumitomo partnership. Both Indonesian companies arecontrolled by children of President Suharto.   Initially, Indonesia had planned to award only onecontract. In the end, Perumtel doubled the volume of work andgave each of the winners half the contract.   The country has only about 1.4 million telephone lines, orone for every 130 people. Cacuk Sudarijanto,president-director of Perumtel, said early this year thatseven million lines are needed just to meet current demand.   In Malaysia, Syarikat Telekom Malaysia Bhd., the nation'spartially privatized phone company, plans to invest 5.35billion ringgits (about $1.96 billion) through 1995 toimprove its system. Industry analysts and diplomats say thatcompetition is stiff for contracts to install switching andnew digital exchanges to replace the outmoded exchanges.Telekom Malaysia has earmarked expenditures of 1 billionringgits in this area through 1995.   Among the competitors are ATandamp;T and Fujitsu Ltd. of Japan.Fujitsu's president, Tadashi Sekizawa, has said that theinitial investment to build digital exchange systems wouldamount to 40 million ringgits if the company won a contractto be Telekom Malaysia's sole provider of the exchangesystems.   Taiwan also has big spending plans for telecommunications.The phone system, like much of the country's infrastructure,just barely meets users' needs: Only about 30% of its 20million people are phone subscribers.   Several projects already are in the bidding stage,including two tenders for cellular-phone and paging networks.Likely bidders for the cellular-phone project are ATandamp;T,Motorola Inc., Northern Telecom Ltd. and Ericsson, which hasthe bulk of the current cellular system. Northern Telecom isa unit of Canada's BCE Inc.   It's unclear just how far the government is planning to goin allowing foreign companies to play a large role inservices. In the equipment sector, however, ATandamp;T, GeneralTelephone andamp; Electronics Ltd. and ITT Corp. provide asignificant amount of technology for Taiwan's existingtelecommunications system.   In Thailand, a contract to install three million phonelines at an estimated cost of $3.4 billion was awarded lastyear to CP Telecommunications Co., a unit of the powerfulagro-industrial Charoen Pokphand Group. But before the dealcould be signed, the government of Prime Minister ChatichaiChoonhavan was toppled amid claims of government corruption.While no public allegations of favoritism were leveledagainst the group, the prime minister's successor, AnandPanyarachun, nevertheless ordered a task force to review theCP Telecom concession.   In April, World Bank advisers concluded that CP Telecom'sbid was higher than other bids. The World Bank panel alsoquestioned the length of the 25-year concession to build andoperate the new phone lines as potentially monopolistic. Inlate June, at the behest of certain high-ranking militaryofficials, the issue was resolved, preserving CP Telecom'slicense but trimming the size of the project from threemillion to two million new lines. ATandamp;T's Mr. Brandt says CPTelecom will begin requesting bids for equipment contracts byearly next year. &quot;We'll be a major bidder for that contractalong with everyone else.&quot;   If the project goes ahead as scheduled, the new lines willmore than triple the capital's current supply of 943,699, orabout one for every six people.</TEXT></DOC>
