The process is designed to find potential problems on sheets, or wafers, of semiconductors with hundreds of circuits. Test probes at various points on a wafer examine data from all the circuits. If performance is substandard in one area, a computer directs a more thorough examination of that area, a spokesman said. Pinpointing a flaw allows a manufacturer to eliminate only the problem circuit rather than scrap the whole sheet.    Artificial intelligence attempts to adapt human problem solving routines to computer programs, enabling the machine to &quot;think&quot; its way to a solution. Currently, manufacturers of electronic parts must test circuits mechanically. The technique was developed at the Bethesda, Md.-based company's main research unit in Baltimore. </TEXT></DOC>
