The brightest member of Bush's Cabinet may rue the day he took it on.    ---   John A. Tatom, an official of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, in its March/April 1989 Review:    (I)Investment in the 1980s was unusually strong and . . . was associated with the unusual decline in the relative price of investment goods. Indeed, there have been few periods when real investment was as large a share of real GNP as it was in 1984-88. In these earlier periods, however, the unemployment rate was substantially lower than recently and measures of capacity utilization were much higher. Adjusted for this cyclical difference, the real investment share in the 1980s was unprecedented in the post-World War II era. </TEXT></DOC>
