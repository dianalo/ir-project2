Though the zloty is freely convertible into dollars (9500per dollar), Poland is unusual for Central Europe in that even the localcurrency is in short supply.andM;There are about 200 computer dealers in Poland, says one of their numberMarek Greniewski, a former scientist who founded Logika three years ago.andP;  Ofthose, only about ten sell custom turnkey systems; Logika is one of them.andO;Others generally throw in copied software to enhance the value of themachines, but they don't provide much support.andP;  And even the systems housestend to use a single copy of a package to support a whole programming team if not a customer base.andP;  Thus the paying market focuses on custom software.andO;Logika's big customers include the state social security administration, forwhich some of its nine programmers are building a benefits-administrationsystem using B-trieve and NetWare and C. It also has a contract from theMinistry of Industry to give training in the use of computers for businessand financial management to people in the top 200 companies to be privatizedby the government.andP;  Logika also runs a computer trading business, importingmostly Taiwanese computers for sale both in Poland and in Czechoslovakia andHungary.andP;  And it supports what it sells, with technical and maintenanceservices out of its office in the old part of Warsaw, and 48-hour hardwareservice countrywide.andP;  Logika has also just signed to distribute PertMasterAdvanced from PertMaster International of the UK, which it will resell withhardware copy-protection.andP;  Greniewski hopes this is just the beginning of abroad selection of software packages for resale.andP;  He sees a lot of customerinterest in multi-user systems, and would like to start selling UNIX systemsand applications.andP;  He also wants to find some good productivity tools; theissue isn't saving programmers' salaries, he says, but overcoming hisinability to find good ones.andM;A hotbed of database high-techandM;However, it's not all that bleak.andP;  In fact, we found one high-end databasecompany, Zeto-Rodan, doing leading-edge work in database design tools andmethodologies and object-oriented systems.andP;  Its founders have led world-classdevelopment efforts at CRAI in Italy and the UN Statistical Center.andP;  Theyspun the firm off from the government computer service firm Zeto:  We went tothe managing director and said either you fund us to leave, or we leaveanyway,&quot; says co-founder Witold Staniszkis.andP;  The government owns 3 to 4percent, but the rest belongs to the employees.andM;A group of longtime database specialists with about 30 people in all, Z-R hasdone work abroad for customers such as the Kuwait Ministry of Planning andFrench consulting firm Progespace, but recently lost a substantial bid forthe Polish tax system to Bull, even though Z-R's bid was substantially lower.andO;(The free market has losers, too.) The firm works with Oracle, Adabas andother databases as well as its own Rodan, a mainframe Codasyl system extendedto support the relational model and SQL.andP;  It is also building its own client/server object-oriented multi-media database for DOS and Xenix, but it coulduse help marketing it abroad.andM;Staniszkis' work with CRAI resulted in two database-related productscurrently marketed worldwide by DBMS Inc. Z-R is looking for a closerrelationship with a database supplier, but for now most of its revenues comefrom contract work for big clients.andP;  It is also angling for support from IBMas an approved software vendor, and is in discussions with McDonnell DouglasInformation Systems.andP;  Revenues were 4.5 billion zlotys ($450,000) last year.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
