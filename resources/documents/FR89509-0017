The regulations have been approved by the Secretary ofState of the United States of America and by the Governor-General of Canadaby Order-in-Council. On behalf of the IPHC, these regulations are publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4> to provide notice of their effectiveness, andto inform persons subject to the regulations of the restrictions and requirementsestablished therein.The substantive changes from the previous regulations, published at 53FR 10536 (April 1, 1988), are as follows: (1) New halibut fishing seasonsand area catch limits are established; (2) all bearings specified in theregulations are changed from magnetic to true; (3) procedures for specifyingfishing period limits are codified; (4) new sport fishing seasons and baglimits are established; (5) check-in and check-out requirements for certainvessels fishing in Regulatory Area 4 are modified; and (6) fishing in morethan one regulatory area in a fishing period for which a fishing periodlimit is in effect is prohibited.The Northern Pacific Halibut Act of 1982 (the Act), Pub. L. 97-176, 16U.S.C. 773c(c), authorizes the Regional Fishery Management Council havingauthority for the geographic area concerned to develop regulations governingthe Pacific halibut catch in U.S. Convention waters which are in additionto, but not in conflict with, regulations of the IPHC. Pursuant to thisauthority, the Under Secretary of Oceans and Atmosphere directed the Pacificand North Pacific Fishery Management Councils to allocate halibut catchesshould such allocations be necessary.The Pacific Fishery Management Council (PFMC) developed a 1989 Catch SharingPlan (Plan) to allocate the total allowable catch (TAC) of Pacific halibutbetween treaty Indian, non-Indian commercial, and non-Indian sport fisheriesin the Commission statistical Area 2A off Washington, Oregon, and California.The 1989 Plan for Area 2A is the result of a process that included developmentof a proposed Plan by a Halibut Managers Group consisting of state, federaland treaty Indian fishery managers, and a Council advisory panel and selectgroup consisting of user group representatives and fishery managers. Theproposed Plan was adopted for public review by the PFMC at its November16-18, 1988 public meeting. The proposed Plan, a description of the needfor the Plan, and a description of the Council's process for developingthe proposed Plan was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> with a request for public comments on January10, 1989 (54 FR 834). The PFMC, at its January 12, 1989, public meeting,adopted the final 1989 Catch Sharing Plan following review and considerationof the recommendations of its advisory bodies and comments made by thepublic. The final Plan was forwarded to the Secretary for review and approvaland to the IPHC for implementation. The Secretary approved the Plan andpublished notice of approval on March 1, 1989 (54 FR 8542). The Plan isfor 1989 only and distributes the 650,000 pound TAC in Area 2A as sub-quotasbetween the three groups as follows: treaty Indian fisheries_152,000 pounds;non-Indian commercial fishery_274,000 pounds; and non-Indian sport fisheries_224,000pounds. The Plan also has provisions for the treaty Indian commercial andceremonial and subsistence fisheries, and the non-Indian sport fisherieswhich were adopted by the IPHC and are included in this action.The North Pacific Fishery Management Council voted to retain the allocativeregulations it adopted in 1988 for certain vessels fishing in RegulatoryArea 4. Those regulations were approved by the Secretary of Commerce andwere published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> as a final rule on June 3, 1988 (53 FR 20327).These regulations are renumbered in this action to conform to the IPHCfinal rule.At its January, 1989 meeting, the IPHC expressed its concern that the catchlimit established for Regulatory Area 4E in 1989 could not be harvestedunder the regulations developed by the North Pacific Fishery ManagementCouncil and approved by the Secretary of Commerce on June 3, 1988 (53 FR20327). The Council's regulations restrict vessels fishing in RegulatoryArea 4E to a maximum catch of 6,000 pounds of halibut per fishing period.The IPHC noted that in 1988, the Council's catch restriction preventedthe full harvest of the catch limit for Regulatory Area 4E; in that year,fishing vessels harvested only about 5 per cent (5,000 pounds) of the 4Ecatch limit of 100,000 pounds. The IPHC determined that if the Council'sfishing period limit were to remain in effect after August 10, 1989, thecatch limit for 4E would likely remain unharvested in 1989 as well. Consequently,the IPHC adopted a regulation suspending the Council's fishing period limitin Regulatory Area 4E after August 10, 1989. That regulation is approved.This action modifies only that portion of the Council's regulation which,in the opinion of the IPHC, would interfere with the full harvest of the4E catch limit. Under section 5(c) of the Northern Pacific Halibut Actof 1982, 16 U.S.C. 773c(c), the Council's 4E fishing period limit regulationis superseded to the extend that it is in conflict with the IPHC's regulation.The IPHC adopted and submitted for approval regulations virtually identicalto the North Pacific Fishery Management Council's fishing period limitsin Regulatory Areas 4C and 4E. The primary purpose of the Council's regulationsis to provide economic protection for halibut fishermen who land all oftheir halibut catch at ports within Areas 4C and 4E. <T3>See</T3> 53 FR 20327 (June 3, 1987). Because allocation of halibutresources among domestic fishermen is the primary purpose, the IPHC's regulationsconcerning fishing period limits in Areas 4C and 4E are rejected. However,the Council's regulations remain in effect and are renumbered in this actionto conform to the IPHC's regulations. The net regulatory effect is thesame.This action also includes a Secretarial final rule modifying the NorthPacific Fishery Management Council's check-in and check-out requirementsat 50 CFR 301.13 for vessels fishing in Regulatory Area 4. <T3>See</T3> 53 FR 20327 (June 3, 1988). The current regulations requirecertain vessels to obtain hold inspections from a fishery officer in DutchHarbor or Akutan before and after fishing in Regulatory Area 4. The Secretaryhas determined that the Council's enforcement objectives may be met morecheaply by replacing the mandatory hold inspection requirement with thevessel clearance procedure prescribed in this Secretarial final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>Because approval by the Secretary of State of the IPHC regulations is aforeign affairs function, <T3>Jensen</T3> vs. <T3>National Marine Fisheries Service,</T3> 512 F. 2d 1189 (9th Cir. 1975),5 U.S.C. 553 of the Administrative Procedure Act, Executive Order 12291,and the Regulatory Flexibility Act do not apply to this notice of the effectivenessand content of the regulations. These regulations do not contain collectionof information requirements subject to the Paperwork Reduction Act.The Secretarial rule included at andSection; 301.19 merely provides noticeof the boundaries of the treaty Indian tribes' usual and accustomed fishingplaces as prescribed under Federal judicial decisions. The Secretarialrule deleting the hold inspection requirement from the regulations at andSection;301.13 affects agency enforcement procedure and relieves a restriction.Therefore, opportunity for prior public comment and a delayed effectivenessperiod are unnecessary and are not being provided under the AdministrativeProcedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553. Because no notice of proposed rulemaking isrequired, the Regulatory Flexibility Act does not apply. No collectionof information under the Paperwork Reduction Act is included in the Secretarialrule.This notice of final rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 301</ITAG>Fish, Fisheries.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
