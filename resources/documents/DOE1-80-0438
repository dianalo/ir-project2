The automatic mounting device for us in small-size wires,is made compact in size, and is a remote control type. For the powerunit, an air type, gasoline engine attached compressor is mounted tothe body. In application, the body of the device runs along a wire ontwo wheels. The running mechanism is based on the principle of 'looper'using two clamps. The device can move vertically to cross over sleeves.The ring is incorporated into a tape for efficient housing and mounting.The fitting force is applied equally on both sides of the ring and fitsthe ring at a max. torque to insure the mounting. For the control, asequence controller is employed to simplify the different types of controland make the device light in weight. The control electric source is suppliedby a gasoline generator placed on the ground. The experiment using testlines shows satisfactory workability and safety. Hereafter, the performanceshould be further improved through field test. (9 figs, 4 tabs, 10 photos)</TEXT></DOC>
