The contract value is based on sales projections of Airbus Industrie, the European consortium.    Allied-Signal, Morris Township, N.J., will work with three European manufacturers to produce the power units: Turbomeca of France, which will build the load compressor; Zahnradfabrik Friedrichshafen of West Germany, the gearbox; and Bodenseewerk Geratetechnik, West Germany, the electronic control.    &quot;Obviously, the size of the contract depends on how many aircraft they build,&quot; an Allied-Signal spokesman said. </TEXT></DOC>
