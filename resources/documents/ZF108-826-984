(product introduction).andO;Product:   Calypso (Office automation software) (product introduction).andO;Topic:     Product IntroductionOffice Automation SoftwareMS-DOS.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Steve HigginsandM;New software from a San Francisco startup could accelerate the spread of&quot;work-flow automation&quot; applications by enabling users to develop thosesystems on standard DOS-based PC LANs.andM;Like the work-flow automation modules in Hewlett-Packard Co.'s NewWave Officeand ATandamp;T's Rhapsody, Systems in Concert Inc.'s Calypso application lets userscreate the electronic equivalent of manila folders containing forms anddocuments, which are passed among PCs according to a predefined, automatedprocedure, said Tony Kobine, the company's president.andM;Both Hewlett-Packard's and ATandamp;T's offerings, however, require OS/2 LANManager or Unix-based networks and NewWave-equipped workstations.andP;  Calypso,available now, is the first work-flow automation program for 640K-byte DOSworkstations running standard DOS applications over Novell NetWare, BanyanVINES and 3Com 3+ networks, Kobine said.andM;&quot;Typically, users already have the platform for which Calypso is designed,&quot;said Michael Howard, president of Infonetics Research Institute Inc. in SanJose, Calif.andM;Calypso comprises five separate modules: a Procedure Editor that lets userscreate a flowchart ordering various steps in a required task; a Work-flowManager that compiles each flowchart task and doles it out to individual PCs;a Session Manager that completes those tasks by working interactively with aPC user or directly with standard applications such as Lotus 1-2-3; aManagement Functions module that provides status reports on procedures; and aSystem Administration module that maintains a central directory of all usersand their authorization level.andM;The modules can be used together to design, execute and archive routineprocedures, such as processing a sales order.andP;  Because it can do that withoutcostly software and hardware upgrades, Calypso makes work-flow automation amore attractive prospect, corporate users said.andM;&quot;[Work-flow automation] is something we've been thinking about for sometime,&quot; said Chris Mead, information-systems manager for the city of Berkeley,Calif., who recently saw a Calypso demo.andP;  &quot;But standardizing on Windows isnot going to happen soon.andP;  Calypso is the first product I've seen that seemsto answer a gap in that market.&quot;andM;Developing automated systems will let the city conduct its business faster,Mead said.andM;Despite Calypso's promise of a relatively inexpensive means of creatingwork-flow automation applications, it does not guarantee acceptance of thetechnology, Infonetics' Howard said.andM;&quot;Calypso allows work-flow automation for the masses, but are they ready?&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;There are a lot of social issues that have to be resolved before youcan do this work on the PC.&quot;andM;Calypso is priced at $10,000 per server for a complete development kit, or$5,000 per server for a run-time version customized by Systems in Concert ora systems integrator.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
