(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hunters call it the experience of alifetime, a trophy retrieved from the long-ago days of the Americanfrontier; critics call the century's first large-scale buffalo hunta slaughter and a disgrace.   More than 15 percent of the Yellowstone National Park buffaloherds have already been killed this winter as they wandered beyondthe park's boundaries to forage, victims of a state law that permitsthe shootings to avert the spread of disease to cattle.   A total of 500 likely will be killed by Monday. And the state wasmailing letters today to 250 hunters, notifying them that they cancome to Paradise Valley to shoot their buffalo if the beasts crossinto Montana.   ``If any animal, even a bloodthirsty Montana hunter, could be apart of this and say it's exciting, it's such stupidity that I can'tbelieve it,'' said Cleveland Amory, president of the Fund forAnimals in New York. ``This is no longer a hunt, it's a massacre.''   East Coast animal-rights activists are not the only peoplecritical of the hunt.   Ellery Merrell, a 73-year-old rancher who has lived his entirelife in Tom Miner Basin about 18 miles north of Yellowstone, said itwas sickening to watch the buffalo fall.   ``They're about as smart as a damned old milk cow,'' Merrell saidof the bison.   Merrell said he had nine buffalo on his property Wednesdaymorning. He allows no buffalo hunting, but the animals are killedwhen they cross the road to other property, he said.   Its legendary lack of intelligence notwithstanding, the buffalofascinates hunters and wildlife lovers equally. The stubborn, shaggygiants represent the frontier lost 100 years ago.   Many of the hunters, most of them Montanans who have hunted alltheir lives, call the bison hunt an experience they will neverforget.   U.S. Rep. Ron Marlenee, R-Mont., said he had looked forward tokilling a bison with his .44-magnum pistol, but was unable to getaway for the hunt.   ``I think that both the National Park Service and the state areacting in a responsible manner,'' Marlenee said. ``There are toomany buffalo in the park. The harvest of those buffalo is a humaneharvest of animals that would otherwise starve to death.''   For the state of Montana, however, it's an economic issue.   About half of Yellowstone's bison carry brucellosis, a diseasewhich some scientists say could be transmitted to Montana cattleherds. Brucellosis causes cows to spontaneously abort their calves.   Herds could be quarantined if the disease should start to spread.   The Legislature cited that concern when it decided in 1985 toallow hunters to kill bison entering Montana. The previous winter,state wildlife officials shot 88 bison in Montana to controlbrucellosis.   But Louisa Willcox of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition dismisseddisease as a justification for the hunt, saying cattle in the areaare vaccinated against it.   ``Theoretically, it's certainly possible,'' she said of thedisease risk. ``Realistically, it's not.''   Once numbering in the millions, the buffalo faced extinction bylate in the 19th century. Yellowstone's buffalo herd has reboundedfrom fewer than 50 at the turn of the century to about 2,700 lastwinter.   Park spokeswoman Joan Anzelmo said that even if all 750 hunterson the state's list were to kill a bison, the survival of theYellowstone herds and the species is not at all threatened by thebiggest hunting death toll of the century.   Anzelmo also said there won't be another year like this one soon.Large numbers of buffalo are being killed this year because recentmild winters allowed the survival of many animals that normallywould have died.   Last year only 39 bison were shot.   Montana originally chose 250 names of hunters from those whoapplied for $200 bison tags at the beginning of the current seasonOct 1. Another 250 were called in January, said Nancy Craft of theMontana Fish, Wildlife and Parks Department.</TEXT></DOC>
