The proposal had three parts: 1. To amend andSection; 701.33(a) to provide that an FCU's board of directorsmay determine, and specify in their bylaws, which board officer may becompensated as such. This change was recommended to conform the regulationto section 112 of the FCU Act (12 U.S.C. 1761a), which was amended in 1982.Prior to that time, the treasurer was the only board officer who couldbe compensated as an FCU official. 2. To amend andSection; 701.33 to permit an FCU to reimburse its officialsfor pay or leave (e.g., annual leave, leave without pay) actually lostwhile attending a meeting of the board of directors or of the supervisoryor credit committees. 3. To amend andSection; 701.33 to provide regulatory guidance to FCU's onindemnification and the purchase of insurance to provide for indemnificationof its officials and employees. In the past, NCUA had interpreted section107(2) (the authority to sue and be sued) and section 107(16) (the incidentalpowers clause) of the FCU Act (12 U.S.C. 1757(2), 1757(16)) as providingan FCU with the authority to indemnify its officials and employees underlimited circumstances. However, no specific guidance had been given. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comment </ITAG>The NCUA Board received 86 comments: 73 from FCU's; 2 from state-charteredcredit unions: 6 from credit union leagues; 3 from trade associations;and 2 from individuals. A. Proposal To Amend Section 701.33 To Conform With Section 112 of theFCU Act (12 U.S.C. 1761a)Few of the commenters addressed the first proposal. Those that did favoredthe change. The Board is amending andSection; 701.33(a) to conform it tosection 112 of the FCU Act. Article VIII, Section 1 of the current FCU Bylaws permits an FCU's boardof directors to designate the board officer, if any, that will be compensated.Some FCU's may be operating under older versions of the FCU Bylaws whicheither do not permit compensation of any board officer, or limit compensationto the financial officer (treasurer). These FCU's will have to adopt ArticleVIII, Section 1 of the FCU Bylaws if they want to compensate a board officer,or if they want to compensate an officer other than the treasurer. B. Proposal To Reimburse Officials for Pay or Leave Lost While AttendingBoard of Directors or Committee Meetings All 86 commenters addressed the suggestion to authorize reimbursing officialsfor pay or leave actually lost while attending board or committee meetings:62 were opposed; 22 were in favor; and 2 opposed the proposal, but favoredreimbursing officials for pay or leave lost while attending credit unionconferences and seminars. (Sixteen of the 22 commenters favoring the proposalalso favored permitting officials to be reimbursed for pay or leave lostwhile attending credit union conferences and seminars.) The primary reasons given for opposing the proposal concerned the creditunion volunteer spirit_that reimbursement was contrary to that philosophy;that voluntarism is what makes credit unions different from other financialinstitutions; and that easing the reimbursement restriction further couldendanger the tax-exempt status of credit unions. Commenters were also concernedabout the possible effects of implementing such an authorization: Dissensionamong board members where some might receive more reimbursement than others;reluctance by some officials to publicly disclose their salaries: additionalIRS reporting requirements for FCU's; difficulty with verifying officials'claims of lost pay or leave; and creation of an incentive to officialsto hold meetings during working hours. Commenters favoring the proposal to reimburse officials for lost pay orleave generally noted that the proposal would assist FCU's in obtainingand keeping qualified officials. Most of these commenters also asked thatthe proposed reimbursement be extended to credit union conferences andseminars. Many of those favoring the proposal stated their assumption thatit is currently permissible to reimburse officials for pay or leave actuallylost while attending credit union conferences and seminars. NCUA staff had recommended this proposal to the NCUA Board in responseto FCU's expressing a need for reimbursement for lost pay and leave toattract and retain qualified volunteers. The comments received on the proposal,however, indicate the vast majority of FCU's feel such reimbursement isunnecessary and may be harmful to the credit union spirit. The NCUA Boardhas decided not to go forward with this proposal. The Board also herebyclarifies that under NCUA's current Rules and Regulations reimbursementof officials for lost pay or leave is not permitted. C. Proposal To Permit Indemnification of FCU Officials and Employees The NCUA Board's third proposed change to andSection; 701.33 was also designedto encourage voluntary service: Establishment of guidelines for indemnificationand the purchase of insurance to provide for indemnification. Thirty-fiveof the commenters addressed this proposal: 34 supported it and one opposed.In general, the commenters agreed that indemnification protection wouldenhance the ability of an FCU to attract volunteers, and many expressedthe belief that such protection was a necessity in today's litigious society.As to the proposed scope of the amendment, two commenters suggested thatthe definition of ``official'' be expanded to include <T3>all </T3>volunteers serving on FCU committees_the proposal had includedonly members of the credit and supervisory committees. Because the primarypurpose of the indemnification provision is to encourage voluntarism, theNCUA Board concurs and is expanding the definition of ``official'' in thefinal amendment to read as follows: ``An `official' is a person who isor was a member of the board of directors, credit committee, supervisorycommittee, or other volunteer committee established by the board of directors.''Two commenters believed that NCUA should set the standards for indemnificationrather than allow FCU's to elect to apply the standards of state law orthe Model Business Corporation Act. The NCUA Board considered a range ofpossibilities_from imposing the clear Federal standard suggested to allowingstate law to control entirely. A middle position has been found appropriate.Under the final amendment, an FCU will be free to choose one of three options:No indemnification; indemnification under the state enabling law applicableto its neighboring state-chartered credit unions; or indemnification underthe Model Business Corporation Act. The only caveat is that any FCU bylawor charter amendment relating to indemnification, like all other such amendments,must be approved by NCUA. This approach maximizes FCU flexibility (particularly in states which havenot enacted an indemnification-enabling statute applicable to credit unions),limits the instances where an FCU or NCUA must determine which state indemnificationlaw is applicable, and accommodates state and local interests. One commenter suggested that an FCU be authorized to combine provisionsof state law and the Model Business Corporation Act in formulating itsindemnification standards. An FCU should be able to elect to follow eitherstate law or the Model Act, but not both, since each represents a unifiedwhole. This option should provide adequate flexibility. Permitting an FCUto select portions of state law and the Model Act would likely lead toinconsistency and confusion. The proposal provided that an FCU which elects to provide indemnificationshall specify whether it will follow state law or the Model Act, and furtherprovided that failure to make an election would be deemed a decision notto provide indemnification. Several commenters objected to this portionof the proposal, stating that an FCU should have the flexibility to provideindemnification on a case-by-case basis if appropriate, and that only anaffirmative decision not to provide indemnification should be binding onan FCU. The NCUA Board agrees, and the language treating a failure to makean election as an affirmative decision not to provide indemnification hasbeen deleted. Several commenters objected to the language prohibiting indemnification``for expenses, penalties, or other payments incurred in an administrativeproceeding brought by the National Credit Union Administration unless theofficial or employee substantially prevails on the merits.'' These commenterswere concerned that NCUA could prevail in an administrative proceedingeven though an official or employee acted in good faith. One commenterwas concerned that this provision might have an inhibiting effect on officialsor employees. Under most state provisions and under the Model Business Corporation Act,indemnification is not available for an employee or official who acts recklessly,wantonly, fraudulently, or in bad faith, receives an improper personalbenefit, or does not have reason to believe that his actions are in thebest interests of the FCU. This would generally be the case when NCUA prevailsin an administrative action; the limitation on indemnification containedin the proposed regulation would therefore affect few, if any, cases. NCUA'sinterests are therefore adequately protected, and this provision has beendeleted from the final rule. As noted in the proposed amendment, the power to provide for indemnificationdoes not relieve an FCU of its responsibility to determine whether indemnificationis appropriate under the circumstances. NCUA will monitor indemnificationprovisions for consistency with the indemnification standards chosen, forthe safety and soundness implications for the institution, and for theirapplication in a given case. Lastly, the final rule clarifies, as did the proposal, that the purchaseof liability insurance is an acceptable method of providing indemnificationprotection to officials and employees. D. Change in Title of the Regulation Section 701.33 was previously entitled ``Compensation of Officials.'' Basedon certain of the comments received on the proposal, it appears that thistitle may have contributed to a misimpression that the regulation authorizesFCU's to compensate board and committee members. The regulation has beenretitled ``Reimbursement, Insurance, and Indemnification of Officials andEmployees.'' This title more accurately reflects the intent of the regulation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Procedures </ITAG>Regulatory Flexibility Act The NCUA Board has determined and certifies that these amendments willnot have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallcredit unions. The changes are directed at clarification and reductionof regulatory confusion and interpretive burdens, rather than creationof new regulatory restrictions. Therefore, a regulatory flexibility analysisis not required.Paperwork Reduction Act The amendments do not impose any paperwork requirements. Executive Order 12612 The NCUA Board has determined that this amendment does not have significantfederalism implications. The amendment has no effect on federally-insured, state-chartered credit unions. The amendment attempts to put FCU's invirtually the same position as their state-chartered credit union neighbors.The sole differences are that an FCU will have the option of followingthe Model Business Corporation Act, and that any FCU bylaw or charter amendmentrelating to indemnification must be approved by NCUA. Thus the effect onstate interests is likely to be minimal. The first difference is neededto accommodate FCU's in states without indemnification-enabling statutesand to ease the need on the part of FCU's and NCUA to determine what statelaw is appropriate. The second merely maintains NCUA's general oversightof FCU charters and bylaws. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 701 </ITAG>Credit unions, Indemnification.By the National Credit Union Administration Board on July 27, 1988. <ITAG tagnum="6">Becky Baker, </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Secretary, NCUA Board. </ITAG>Accordingly, NCUA amends 12 CFR Part 701 as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 701_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.
