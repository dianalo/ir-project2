He refers tothe two nations of Czechoslovakia, a country formed by Czech landsand Slovakia:   Dear popular meeting. My dear residents of Prague, I love you,you know that, but I will tell you just the same. I am happy to bewith you.   Again, after a longer time, I appear before you and thus beforeall our people who once again raised their voices for a renewal ofsociety, a renewal of our unbreakable community, of our nations,which are so close and related by blood. This mutual bond is alsotoday a pillar of the present democratic renewal, our inseparableand indivisible Fatherland of our two nations, Czechoslovakia.   Yesterday, at the square in Bratislava, a crowd of more than100,000 people met in the spirit of solidarity, of popular civicinitiative which unites us in this historic elation. We all knowthat the present state of crisis in the country was caused byviolent military intervention in the affairs and life which havebelonged to the people of this country only. For this reason,departure from this unhappy legacy and from the whole so-calledpolicy of normalization and its birth, is unconditional and brooksno delay.   This is clearly expressed by the attitudes of all civicmovements, of former Communist Party members who have beenexpelled, of youth, artists' and cultural movements, yesterday inBratislava and today again here.   I see this movement has found support in the working class,among peasants, in all strata of the working people.   The broad and complex stream of today's great movement shouldconverge into a joint stream which will once again elevate theinitiative of the people, our country to a place it rightly has inEurope.   Today, the new Civic Forum is being formed, with the platform ofa new socialist renewal. I declare that I stand by this platformand give it my voice before the citizens of Prague and all workingpeople.   People of Prague, in unity with all the people, played animportant part in the renewal of socialism 21 years ago.   I say this because the working class, People's Militias ... withthe sympathies of our army and police stood side-by-side. I saythis, that today, too, these forces should stand on the side of thepeople. Do not act against the people, you are a part of it,remember you are from the people.   The ideal of socialism with a human face is living in the mindsof a new generation.   Don't give way to extremist trends, so that the people'smovement can be crowned with success and reflect the cultural levelof this nation.   An old, wise man said, `If once there was light, why shouldthere be darkness again?' We had lived in darkness for too long.Let us act in such a way to bring the light back again.</TEXT></DOC>
