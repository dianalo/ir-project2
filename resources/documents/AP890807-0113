Streit is now serving a 10-year prison sentence for fraud forrunning a con game that bilked nearly 200 people out of anestimated $18 million.   Streit's investment scam was among several cited by statesecurities regulators Monday at a news conference announcing a15-state survey of religious-oriented investment schemes that havecost 15,000 investors some $450 million since 1985.   U.S. Rep. William Dickinson, R-Ala., was among the investorstaken in by Streit, the former treasurer of one of the largestBaptist churches in Alabama.   ``He never invested any of the money,'' said Rash.   Streit, who kept a stock market ticker running in his office andmaintained three satellite dishes at his $400,000 house, toldinvestors he had a direct link to every major exchange in theworld, said Rash.   Although Streit promised an exhorbitant return of 30 percent to35 percent per month, his investors didn't question him. One victimstated, ``It was sort of comforting to see the Bible verse printedat the end of the monthly statements.''   Streit traded on his role as a deacon of the church as well as aformer accountant and bank trust officer to bilk ``virtually everyprominent businessman in the Huntsville area,'' said Rash.   ``Everybody thought he had divine guidance, he played his rolereal well,'' Rash said in an interview.   Dickinson was out of the country and was unavailable for comment.</TEXT></DOC>
