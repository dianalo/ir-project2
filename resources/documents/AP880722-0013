The packed hall exploded in cheers as Jackson and his wifejoined Dukakis and his wife on the platform where Dukakis hadformally accepted the party's presidential nomination momentsbefore.   The one-time rivals talked animatedly and then Jackson kissedKitty Dukakis.   Jackson, whose presence has electrified many a hall, slippedinto the Omni unnoticed until Dukakis waved to the civil rightsleader as he sat with former President Jimmy Carter.   The Massachusetts governor called Jackson ``a man who has liftedso many hearts with the dignity and the hope of his messagethroughout this campaign; a man whose very candidacy says to everychild _ aim high; to every citizen _ you count; to every voter _you can make a difference; to every American _ you are a fullshareholder in our dream.''   Jackson and Carter stood together and accepted the cheers of thecrowd.   Then Dukakis closed his speech by praising Jackson's children,who had introduced their father to the convention Tuesday night.   ``What stirred me most on Tuesday were those fine handsome andproud and articulate Jackson children talking about their hopes forthe future of this country,'' Dukakis said. ``You know, youngJacqueline Jackson goes to school in Massachusetts. And last month,she visited with me at the Statehouse in Boston. She's a remarkableyoung woman, and I know her parents are very proud of her.''   Earlier, Jackson had instructed his delegates to back LloydBentsen of Texas for vice president, despite the tension withJackson after Dukakis choose the senator.   ``The vice presidential nomination is appropriately the choiceof the presidential nominee. While I may disagree with bothGovernor Dukakis and Senator Bentsen on some important issues, ourinterests converge in building a coalition to beat the Republicansthis fall,'' Jackson said in a statement. ``We Democrats will beunited in the fall in support of the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.''   ``We will all be represented in the fall campaign councils, andI will make sure that the progressive agenda remains an integralpart of the Democratic vision,'' Jackson said.   At the end of the remarkably peaceful and united DemocraticNational Convention, Jackson linked arms with Bentsen's wife in aline with the presidential nominee and his wife to join in signingthe Battle Hymn of the Republic.   But earlier, he hinted at future retribution against someDemocratic super delegates, saying his supporters ``won electionsin the streets. They lost them in the suites.''   The Democratic runner-up singled out New York Mayor Ed Koch forparticular criticism, equating his activities in the New Yorkprimary with those of the late Richard Daley in Chicago during thebloody 1968 convention.   Jackson, his presidential bid over, met with supportersthroughout the day, thanking them for their efforts and lookingtoward the general election against George Bush and the Republicans.   ``Last night went very well,'' Jackson said. ``It showedtremendous expansion in our party.''   Jackson's national campaign chairman, California AssemblySpeaker Willie Brown, brushed off suggestions that the Dukakiscampaign was not offering enough spots to Jackson aides.   ``Jackson's people and Dukakis' people are now one and thesame,'' said Brown as Jackson met with members of the CongressionalBlack Caucus.   But Jackson was angered by not winning states in the delegateroll call that he had won in the primaries and caucuses.   ``Those states we won in the primaries, we should have won lastnight,'' he told reporters. ``The downside (of the roll call) wasjust the revelation of the role that the super delegates played.This did so much violence to their constituencies.''   Jackson won 13 states, but had delegate majorities in only four.He won Alabama, Alaska, Delaware, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippiand Puerto Rico, but Dukakis had a delegate majority in each.Jackson won Michigan and Virginia, but the final delegate tally ineach was a tie.   Jackson was complaining that the super delegates _ more than 600party and elected officials with automatic seats at the convention_ did not vote the way of their constituents in the roll call. Heis fond of pointing out that he had the votes of only one stateparty chairman and one U.S. senator.   ``It was not good for people in Virginia, Louisiana and placeslike that where the people won and then super delegates imposedtheir will upon the people ... They won the elections in thestreets. They lost them in the suites,'' he said.   Jackson did not name any particular super delegates, but he didpoint to Koch as a divisive figure in the 1988 campaign.   As he praised Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young for his handling of theconvention this year, Jackson told a group of black businessmen:``We have had mayors who destroyed Democratic conventions orDemocratic primaries. You look at Daley in '68 or Koch in '88.''   Daley's handling of demonstrators at the 1968 convention led tobloody confrontations in the streets and political turmoil in thehall. Koch made pointed criticisms of Jackson in the New Yorkprimary, saying Jewish voters should not back the black candidatebecause of his anti-Israel positions.   But Jackson said he was not talking about retribution.   ``I would never do a thing like retribution. I do believe inaccountability. I do believe in reciprocity,'' he said.   In the 13 states and 100 congressional districts he said he wonin the primaries, Jackson said his supporters would be talking tothose super delegates who did not back his candidacy on Wednesdaynight.   ``There will be vigorous activities at the state andcongressional district level for new relationships withcongresspeople, senators and governors,'' he said.   Jackson said the changes he pushed for in the 1992 party ruleswill help his cause, cutting the number of super delegates by athird.</TEXT></DOC>
