<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-53-0995 </DOCNO><TEXT>Bell Laboratories have announced the preparation of a new superconductingmaterial that does not contain copper, an essential material of all superconductingmaterials prepared in the past two and one-half years. The new material,Ba/sub 0.6/K/sub 0.4/BiO{sub 3}, shows an onset of superconductivityat 30 K. The material also does not exhibit the layered structure thatseems to be at the heart of copper-oxygen superconductors. The new materialis a three-dimensional structure of bismuth and oxygen interspersed withatoms of bismuth and potassium, and its current carrying properties areless dependent upon direction of crystal orientation than for previouslyreported materials.</TEXT></DOC>
