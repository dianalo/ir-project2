(products).andO;Ticker:    AAPL.andO;Product:   System 7.0 (Operating system) (product enhancement)PostScript (Printer software) (forecasts)Apple Macintosh (Microcomputer) (computer programs).andO;Topic:     FontsEnhancementsTypesetting.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Rick LePageandM;San Jose, Calif.andP;  -- Even though Apple's System 7.0 software is six to eightmonths away from shipping, developers are receiving alpha copies, and thosedevelopers and users alike are thinking about the potential implications --good and bad -- of TrueType and the future of PostScript.andM;System 7 will offer improvements to the Mac operating system, but noenhancement has raised as much controversy as TrueType, Apple's outline-fonttechnology.andP;  Unlike PostScript type, TrueType will be incorporated at thesystem level, coexisting with the Mac's current bit-mapped font technology.andM;The TrueType font model under System 7 will function in many ways like AdobeSystems Inc.'s Adobe Type Manager, in which the PostScript outline-font fileis used to generate type for both the screen display and output devices.andO;(This font-rendering process reduces the need for hand-tuned screen fonts formultiple point sizes and helps to ensure optimum readability of type at anyresolution).andM;Several font vendors have announced support for TrueType, and Microsoft Corp.andO;announced last fall that the company will use the TrueType format in itsWindows and OS/2 environments.andP;  Adobe also has announced that it will provideATM compatibility across multiple platforms, which should cause someinteresting competitive moves in the next year.andM;For current users of PostScript type, however, the main concern about System7.0 and TrueType is whether the two font standards can coexist, allowingusers to protect any investment they already have in PostScript printingdevices and type.andP;  Apple has been fairly explicit about this, stating thatTrueType is an addition to the Mac architecture, not a replacement forexisting technology.andP;  Both bit-mapped and PostScript fonts will operate asthey have under earlier versions.andM;Printing a document to a PostScript printer under System 7 will involve thesame procedure used by the Mac's LaserWriter driver, which first looks forbuilt-in PostScript fonts or those on a hard drive connected to the printer.andO;If the outline fonts are not found at the printer level, the Mac looks forthe outline-font files in the System folder and downloads them to theprinter.andP;  If that fails, the Mac will use the bit-mapped fonts and scale themappropriately.andM;When printing to a PostScript printer under System 7, TrueType font renderingwill take place after the driver has exhausted its search for PostScriptoutlines but before it performs bit-mapped scaling.andM;Another concern with System 7 is whether it will be compatible with ATM.andO;John Kunze, Adobe director of application product marketing, said: &quot;Adobe isfirmly committed to ensuring ATM compatibility under System 7.&quot;andM;As for the issues related to whether TrueType fonts are rendered &quot;better&quot;than PostScript fonts, that is an issue that can only be decided when System7 finally ships.andP;  You can at least be assured that your investment inPostScript will be protected.andP;  n</TEXT></DOC>
