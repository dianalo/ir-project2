Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizingeach FAA/public contact, concerned with the substance of this proposal,will be filed in the Rules Docket. Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this Notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped post cardon which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 89-NM-101-AD.''The post card will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>On April 7, 1989, the FAA issued AD 89-09-05, Amendment 39-6197 (54 FR15730; April 19, 1989), to prohibit use of the autopilot on AerospatialeModel ATR42 series airplanes when operating in icing conditions. That actionwas prompted by an incident in which an Aerospatiale Model ATR42 airplaneoperating in icing conditions (believed to have been freezing rain) experiencedroll excursions and autopilot disconnect. This condition, if not corrected,could result in loss of control of the airplane. Since issuance of that AD, flight testing and analysis have demonstratedthat installation of vortex generators on the upper surface of the ModelATR42 airplane wing significantly improves the effectiveness of the ailerons,which reduces the severity of the roll upset that can occur with asymmetricice accumulations resulting from icing conditions, such as freezing rain.Aerospatiale has issued Service Bulletin ATR42-57-0018, dated May 3, 1989,which describes procedures for installation of vortex generators on theupper surface of the wing. This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of Section 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, an AD is proposedwhich would revise AD 89-09-05 to require installation of vortex generators,in accordance with the service bulletin previously described, as terminatingaction to the prohibition of use of the autopilot in icing conditions.The FAA has determined that long term continued operational safety willbe better assured by design changes to remove the source of the problem,rather than by repetitive inspections or special operating procedures.Long term special operating procedures may not be providing the degreeof safety assurance necessary for the transport airplane fleet. This, coupledwith a better understanding of the human factors associated with numerouscontinual special procedures, has led the FAA to consider placing lessemphasis on special procedures and more emphasis on design improvements.The proposed modification requirement is in consonance with that policydecision. It is estimated that 43 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 4 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 permanhour. The necessary modification parts would be provided by the manufacturerat no charge to operators. Based on these figures, the total cost impactof the AD on U.S. operators is estimated to be $6,880. The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(1) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39: </ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment  </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend Part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED] </ITAG>1.

Section 39.13 is amended by amending Amendment 39-6197 (54 FR 15730;April 19, 1989), AD 89-09-05, as follows:<ITAG tagnum="26"><T4>Aerospatiale: </T4>Applies to Model ATR42 series airplanes, certificatedin any category.

Within 10 hours time-in-service after May 3, 1989 (the effectivedate of Amendment 39-6197), incorporate the following into the LimitationsSection of the FAA-approved Airplane Flight Manual (AFM). This may be accomplishedby including a copy of this AD in the AFM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">When operating in icing conditions, as defined in the AFM, or whenfreezing rain is forecast or reported, use of the autopilot is prohibited.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="74">Warning </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Prolonged operation in freezing rain should be avoided. Ice accretiondue to freezing rain may result in asymmetric wing lift and associatedincreased aileron forces necessary to maintain coordinated flight. Wheneverthe aircraft exhibits buffet onset, uncommanded roll, or unusual controlwheel forces, immediately reduce angle-of-attack and avoid excessive maneuvering.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">B. Within 60 days after the effective date of this amendment, installvortex generators, in accordance with Aerospatiale Service Bulletin ATR42-57-0018,dated May 3, 1989. This action constitutes terminating action for the AFMprohibition required in paragraph A., above, regarding use of the autopilotwhen operating in icing conditions, and the limitation may be removed fromthe AFM. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">C.
