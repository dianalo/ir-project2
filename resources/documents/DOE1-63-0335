A benefit-cost model was used as the analytical tool for theevaluation of the cost-effectiveness of energy conservation and energysupply projects from both the private and public perspectives. The completerange of energy conservation measures in the industrial sector was evaluatedfor technical potential. From these measures, a selection of 39 energy-savingconservation projects in five industries were selected and evaluatedas the basis for determining the economics of energy conservation inthe industrial sector. Frontier natural gas, an oil sands project, anda nuclear electric power station were selected to represent the costof energy from new energy supply projects. Energy supply prices (resourcecosts) were calculated for all projects. In the case of the conservationprojects, the energy saved was taken in effect to be equivalent to energysupplied, thereby reducing the requirement for that quantity of energyto be made available from energy supply projects. If fully implemented,the energy conservation projects would provide major energy savings.The total implementation cost for these projects appears to be significantlyless than the implementation cost required to produce equivalent quantitiesof energy from the selected energy supply project. In this sense, theeconomics of saving energy appears to be favourable compared to the productionof energy from new sources of supply, and the implementation of energyconservation projects would appear to have a correspondingly higher priorityfrom the public perspective. 45 refs., 4 figs., 3 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
