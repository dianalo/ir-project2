In a meeting with securities analysts, the company also said it plans an 8.6% increase in capital spending this year, to $240 million. The increased spending will be used mainly to improve manufacturing efficiency, said Reuben Mark, chairman, president and chief executive officer.    The company will slightly increase research and development spending to &quot;around $100 million.&quot; Mr. Mark said. Colgate's Palmolive liquid dishwasher detergent, introduced last year, holds a 17% market share.    Mr. Mark also said the company was &quot;continuing to examine&quot; its operations in South Africa. He said he believes an American business presence in the country is &quot;important,&quot; but that the matter is still being considered.    A Colgate spokeswoman said the company employs 636 in its South African manufacturing and marketing operation. She wouldn't disclose sales in the country but said Colgate sells a &quot;full range of traditional household and personal products.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
