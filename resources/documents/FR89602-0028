Communications should identifythe regulatory docket number and be submitted in duplicate to the addressspecified above. All communications received on or before the closing datefor comments specified above will be considered by the Administrator beforetaking action on the proposed rule. The proposals contained in this Noticemay be changed in light of the comments received.Comments are specifically invited on the overall regulatory, economic,environmental, and energy aspects of the proposed rule. All comments submittedwill be available, both before and after the closing date for comments,in the Rules Docket for examination by interested persons. A report summarizingeach FAA/public contact, concerned with the substance of this proposal,will be filed in the Rules Docket.Commenters wishing the FAA to acknowledge receipt of their comments submittedin response to this Notice must submit a self-addressed, stamped post cardon which the following statement is made: ``Comments to Docket Number 89-NM-77-AD.''The post card will be date/time stamped and returned to the commenter.<T4>Discussion: </T4>The Direction Generale de L'Aviation Civile (DGAC),which is the airworthiness authority of France, in accordance with existingprovisions of a bilateral airworthiness agreement, has notified the FAAof an unsafe condition which may exist on Airbus Industrie Model A310 seriesairplanes. There has been one report where the emergency exit doors couldnot be opened after landing, due to ice buildup on the opening mechanism.This condition, if not corrected, could prevent exit of passengers in anemergency situation.Airbus Industrie has issued Service Bulletin A310-52-2017, Revision 2,dated December 22, 1987, applicable to Model A310 series airplanes, whichdescribes procedures for modification of the opening mechanism on the emergencyexit doors which will prevent condensation from accumulating. The DGAChas classified this service bulletin as mandatory, and has issued FrenchAirworthiness Directive 86-28-72(B) addressing this subject.This airplane model is manufactured in France and type certificated inthe United States under the provisions of andSection; 21.29 of the FederalAviation Regulations and the applicable bilateral airworthiness agreement.Since this condition is likely to exist or develop on other airplanes ofthe same type design registered in the United States, an AD is proposedwhich would require modification of the opening mechanism on the emergencyexit doors, in accordance with the service bulletin previously described.It is estiamted that 18 airplanes of U.S. registry would be affected bythis AD, that it would take approximately 47 manhours per airplane to accomplishthe required actions, and that the average labor cost would be $40 permanhour. The estimated cost for the modification kits is $841. Based onthese figures, the total cost impact of the AD on U.S. operators is estimatedto be $48,978.The regulations proposed herein would not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.For the reasons discussed above, I certify that this proposed regulation(l) is not a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) if promulgated, will not have a significant economicimpact, positive or negative, on a substantial number of small entitiesunder the criteria of the Regulatory Flexibility Act. A copy of the draftevaluation prepared for this action is contained in the regulatory docket.A copy of it may be obtained from the Rules Docket.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 39</ITAG>Air transportation, Aircraft, Aviation safety, Safety.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Proposed Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me by the Administrator,the Federal Aviation Administration proposes to amend Part 39 of the FederalAviation Regulations as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 39_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
