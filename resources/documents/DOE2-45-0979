Ice management is basically based on the conceptof setting an iceberg alarm zone: When an iceberg enters this zone, workersseparate the drill pipe, protect the wells, and make preparations forseparating the iceberg from the drilling worksite. Workers prevent aniceberg from colliding with a rig or drilling ship by changing the directionof the rig or ship using one, or two combined, of four methods: crushing,towing, propeller water jet, or canonization. Drilling is executed byusing a floating drill, a gravel-type artificial island, and a sit-on-bottomgravity-type structure. The Japanese expedition has built a semi-submersibledrill and MCDU (moored conical drilling unit), which have been used inthe Norwegian and Canadian territories in the polar region.
