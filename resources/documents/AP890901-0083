The Anglican archbishop, winner of the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize,was angered by reports that police earlier today had severely beatenabout 20 protesters from the Western Province Council of Churches.   The clerics and churchworkers said police used batons and whipsto chase them from a security police office in Cape Town, where theyhad gone to condemn recent detentions of activists.   Later, when Tutu and the other activists left St. George'sCathedral to begin a protest march, they encountered police whoformed a human barricade. Police told the demonstrators to disperse,then led them into vans when they refused.   The marchers carried placards with slogans such as ``To Hell WithRestrictions!'' and ``Stop Killing Our People!''   Canon Winston Ndungane, chief executive officer of AnglicanChurch in South Africa, said Tutu's arrest was ``a furtherindication that the authorities will use whateverwork stoppages at theirfactories to protest a labor law which they say cripples their powerto strike.   One of the biggest union protests was at a Unilever Ltd. factoryin Boksburg, east of Johannesburg, where 1,000 workers marchedaround the premises, many carrying placards denouncing the year-oldLabor Relations Amendment Act.   The two main black labor federations on Thursday called on their1.5 million members to stage protests against the act, which limitsthe ability of workers to strike, during work hours today.   The federations also joined other major anti-apartheid groups incalling for a national protest on Tuesday and Wednesday against thesegregated parliamentary elections on Wednesday. In the past, suchprotests have taken the form of a general strike.   The same organizations have been orchestrating a campaign sinceearly August to challenge segregation laws and mobilize oppositionto the elections.   On Saturday, activists plan to attempt an illegal march towardthe Parliament buildings in Cape Town, and on Sunday blacks plan tohold a mass picnic on a whites-only beach in Durban.   Police have arrested or detained scores of activists in the pastweek and have banned at least two protest rallies planned for thisweekend, including a ``peace service'' in Soweto which was to beaddressed by Tutu.   The Detainees Aid Center, which assists families of detainees,said two black activists were detained Thursday in Soweto when theymade their daily appearance at a police station in accordance withrestrictions imposed when they were released from a previous stintin detention.   On Cape Town's outskirts, where police and militant youths haveclashed daily for several weeks, several mixed-race studentsreportedly were wounded today when officers fired tear gas andbirdshot to disperse a rally.   The independent South African Press Association quoted a teacheras saying several students were arrested.   Police said three mixed-race men were injured Thursday night whena small mine exploded at a civic center in Athlone, near Cape Town.There was no claim of responsibility.   Police headquarters said five black men were found dead frombullet wounds at a house in Natal Province. Much of the province hasbeen wracked by a three-year power stuggle pitting supporters ofmilitant anti-apartheid groups against members of the moreconservative Zulu political organization Inkatha.</TEXT></DOC>
