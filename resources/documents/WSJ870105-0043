The president is trying to hold the fiscal 1988 federal deficit within the Gramm-Rudman limit. But he wants a 3% real increase in defense spending.    He has a good case. Defense has borne the brunt of budget cutting these past few years; it's time for Congress to look elsewhere for economies. The president will suggest one good place to look: farm subsidies.    Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger says defense spending actually will fall in real terms this fiscal year, after two years of essentially no growth. The $312 billion Mr. Weinberger wants for fiscal 1988 is $100 billion less than the budget authority envisioned only two years ago for FY '88. Only a year ago, the defense secretary was expecting funding of more than $332 billion.    The cost of federal benefit programs, meanwhile, has been rising much faster than expected. Social-welfare programs now account for nearly half of all federal spending. The Congressional Budget Office last August predicted social spending would rise from $467 billion in the current fiscal year, 1987, to $499 billion in 1988 and eventually to $593 billion in 1991. CBO now says that new estimates are $10 billion to $15 billion higher for 1987 and 1988, and more than $20 billion higher for 1991.    At the same time, of course, Washington is obligated to meet the Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction targets. The goals are for deficits of no more than $144 billion for the current year and $108 billion for 1988. The federal budget is supposed to be balanced by 1991.    This will present a telling challenge to the new Democratic majority on Capitol Hill. The Democrats are triumphantly returning to Washington to take control of both the House and Senate for the first time since 1980. How they handle the budget is likely to be an issue in the 1988 elections. Results of the 1980 and 1984 campaigns suggest that they would be unwise to assume that defense bashing is popular with the voters.    Indeed, both Republicans and Democrats might be well advised to keep a weather eye on rising public exasperation with federal giveaways. Mr. Reagan's challenge to Congress to do something about the explosion in farm subsidies was well timed. There will be plenty of farm-state legislators defending those handouts to their constituents, but they won't be doing their presidential candidate any favor. In the long run, they won't be doing farmers a favor either. We don't think farmers want to remain on the public dole.    The U.S. military has been saved from dangerous, aggression -- inviting inferiority by major modernization projects launched early in this decade. These new armaments are coming through the pipeline. But within a couple of years that stream will slow to a trickle if current defense-investment trends continue. By one estimate, military procurement for fiscal 1988 will be budgeted at $57 billion less than was envisioned only two years ago.    If Congress pares further, it could begin taking a toll of less exotic parts of the military budget, such as operations and maintenance, ammunition, spare parts and even force structure. All these elements are crucial to military readiness. Administration officials also are concerned that the new Democratic majority might be pushed by its left wing into mindless unilateral-disarmament legislation of the type trotted out just before the Reykjavik summit last year -- to the great satisfaction of Mikhail Gorbachev.    Last year, Congress approved an extensive reform of the Pentagon. Much of this was based on work done by the Senate Armed Services Committee and the President's Blue Ribbon Commission on Defense Management headed by David Packard. These studies stressed the need for more long-range planning and less congressional interference.    The initial responses from some Democrats to Reagan budget previews point in quite the opposite direction. Yet the country has gone down that road before, seeing the price of defense soar as programs are stretched out and readiness deteriorates. How the new Congress deals with the defense budget will be a test of its social contract with President Reagan to responsibly reduce the federal deficit. If national security falls victim once more to pork-barrel politics, the folks on Capitol Hill will have a lot to answer for come 1988. </TEXT></DOC>
