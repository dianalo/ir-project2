DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan says he vetoed a bill tocoordinate federal policy and advice on nutrition because it wouldhave created an ``unnecessary and complex federal bureaucracy.''   Backers of the bill said it was designed to make the governmentspeak with one voice on nutrition instead of having several agenciesan departments issue conflicting advice to the public.   ``The administration strongly supports the principal goals ofthis legislation and reaffirms its commitment to use existingauthority to achieve these ends,'' Reagan said in a statementWednesday. ``However, enactment of the bill would set up federalnutrition efforts on the wrong course.   ``The bill would create a substantial amount of unnecessary andcomplex federal bureaucracy that would hamper the achievement of thebill's goals,'' he said.   Reagan also vetoed a bill requiring specific questions in the1990 census relating to plumbing facilities and heating and coolingequipment. He said the questions would not produce enough usefulinformation to justify the increased cost and paperwork.   The nutrition bill gave shared responsibility for the program tothe Agriculture Department and the Department of Health and HumanServices and would also have created an administrator of nutritionmonitoring, an interagency board and an advisory council.   ``The creation of so much new federal bureaucracy would hinder,rather than aid, performance of federal nutrition-relatedfunctions,'' Reagan said.   The bill also would ``impose a substantial new burden on theAmerican taxpayer in future years to pay for federal governmentgrants'' by requiring that a grant program be established as aresult of the study, he said.   ``Experience shows that once the federal government beginshanding out money under a new grant program, a politicalconstituency develops that demands greater funding for thatprogram,'' the president said.</TEXT></DOC>
