The EPA initiated thisassessment based on the production volume of sodium hydroxide and the potentialfor adverse health effects associated with exposure to sodium hydroxide.The results of EPA's preliminary analysis indicate that currently availabledata are insufficient to establish that emissions of sodium hydroxide tothe ambient air pose a significant threat to public health. Based on thisinformation, the EPA has determined that regulation of sodium hydroxideunder the CAA is not warranted at this time.Given the limited opportunity for prior public review of the health andexposure information incorporated in this notice, the Agency is solicitingcomment on its determination. This finding has no effect on the regulationof sodium hydroxide to attain the national ambient air quality standardsfor particulate matter. In addition, this notice does not preclude anyState or local air pollution control agency from specifically regulatingemission sources of sodium hydroxide.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Written comments pertaining to this notice must be receivedon or before April 13, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Submit comments (duplicate copies are preferred) to:Central Docket Section (A-130), U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, Attn:Docket No. A-88-20, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC 20460.

In the course of this assessment, the Agency collectedthe available relevant information and today's notice provides a summaryof this information on the following topics: chemical characterization,production and uses, sources and emissions, atmospheric degradation, healtheffects, monitored ambient air concentrations, exposure estimation, riskcharacterization, and existing regulations and guidelines. <ITAG tagnum="84">Chemical Characterization </ITAG>Sodium hydroxide (CAS No. 131-07-32) is a white deliquescent, crystallinesolid at room temperature (U.S. EPA, 1988a). Sodium hydroxide is very solublein water and is often used in 45 to 75 percent in acqueous solutions (U.S.EPA, 1987a). Sodium hydroxide has a melting point of 318 degrees centigradeand a boiling point of 1390 degrees centigrade (U.S. EPA, 1988a). <ITAG tagnum="84">Production and Uses </ITAG>Sodium hydroxide is produced in large quantities in the United States.There are more than 40 production facilities which in 1985 produced approximately11 million short tons of sodium hydroxide. Most sodium hydroxide is producedas a 50 percent solution in water. Sodium hydroxide is produced by theelectrolysis of sodium chloride via the diaphragm, mercury, or membranecell process (U.S. EPA 1988a). Sodium hydroxide is one of the most widely used chemicals in the UnitedStates. In 1982, the total United States' consumption of sodium hydroxidewas slightly greater than 8 million metric tons which was 20 percent belowthe record consumption of 10.1 million metric tons in 1979. The largestmarket for sodium hydroxide is in the chemical industry (48 percent oftotal demand) where it is used in the production of alumina from bauxite,and also used for pH control and in the neutralization of waste acids.The next largest market is the pulp and paper industry with 26 percentof total demand (U.S. EPA, 1988a). <ITAG tagnum="84">Sources and Emissions </ITAG>Routine emissions of sodium hydroxide into the environment occur via aerosolemissions, aqueous waste streams and consumer uses. There are numerousindustries which emit sodium hydroxide. The major industries that emitsodium hydroxide to the atmosphere are the kraft pulp industry, the brewingindustry, auto carburetor manufacturing, plating, industrial organic chemicalmanufacturing, soap manufacturing and metal partitions. The largest sourceof sodium hydroxide emissions to the atmosphere is the kraft pulp industry.For a more complete discussion of the industrial process which emit sodiumhydroxide to the atmosphere the reader is referred to the sodium hydroxidepreliminary source assessment (U.S. EPA, 1988a). <ITAG tagnum="84">Atmospheric Degradation </ITAG>Sodium hydroxide is very short lived in the atmosphere. Sodium hydroxidereleased to the atmosphere as an aerosol in solution with water will beneutralized as a result of its reaction with carbon dioxide. The principal reaction products are sodium carbonate and water. The atmospherichalf life of sodium hydroxide has been estimated at 13 seconds (U.S. EPA,1988c). In the short-term modeling analysis described below, this rateof degradation results in only 0.4 percent of the sodium hydroxide releasedremaining at a point 200 meters from the site of release. For a more completediscussion of analysis of the atmospheric fate of sodium hydroxide thereader is referred to the public docket for this action, specifically theentry entitled ``Estimation of the Half-Life of Sodium Hydroxide Aerosolin the Atmosphere'' (U.S. EPA, 1988c). <ITAG tagnum="84">Health Effects </ITAG>The Agency has prepared a document entitled ``Summary Review of the HealthEffects Associated with Sodium Hydroxide: Health Issue Assessment'' (U.S.EPA, 1987a). This document discusses the relevant data available for assessingthe health effects associated with exposure to sodium hydroxide in theambient air. This information is summarized briefly below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Carcinogenicity and Mutagenicity </ITAG>No <T3>in vivo </T3>animal studies of sodium hydroxide carcinogenicity werefound in the literature (U.S. EPA, 1988b). There are some data, however,which suggest that the incidence of carcinoma of the esophagus is greatlyincreased following accidental or intentional ingestion of sodium hydroxide(lye) in humans (Lansing et al., 1969; Kiviranta, 1952). The National Institutefor Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), however, points out that thesecarcinomas were the result of tissue destruction and possibly scar formationand were not caused by the direct carcinogenic potential of sodium hydroxideitself. In an epidemiological study of workers chronically exposed to sodiumhydroxide dust, no relationship between malignancies or mortality was observed(Ott et al., 1977). Sodium hydroxide has not been adequately tested for mutagenic potential.Two bacterial assays have suggested sodium hydroxide is not mutagenic.However, an <T3>in vitro </T3>deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis study and an <T3>in vivo </T3>study of insect spermatocytes suggested sodium hydroxidemay be mutagenic. Based on EPA's ``Guidelines for Carcinogenic Risk Assessment''(51 FR 33992), sodium hydroxide has been classified in the weight of evidencecategory ``D,'' meaning it is not classifiable as to human carcinogenicity.<ITAG tagnum="84">Developmental and Reproductive Toxicity </ITAG>Only one study exists on the developmental toxicity of sodium hydroxide.This study (Dostal, 1973) indicated increased mortality in the fetusesof mice when the dams were treated intraamniotically with a weak sodiumhydroxide solution. Although this study suggests an embryotoxic effect,it is difficult to envision such an exposure resulting from sodium hydroxidein the ambient air. <ITAG tagnum="84">Other Toxic Effects </ITAG>The adverse health effects associated with exposure to sodium hydroxideresult from its extreme alkalinity. In evaluating the toxicity of sodiumhydroxide, therefore, it is important to consider the pH of the solutionto which individuals may be exposed. Furthermore, because sodium hydroxideis a solid or liquid at room temperature, the size of the particles towhich individuals may be exposed is important for evaluating toxicity resultingfrom inhalation exposure. Larger particles tend to settle out faster andthus have a greater effect on the upper respiratory tract, whereas smallerparticles tend to affect the lower regions. Contact with sodium hydroxide in either solid, liquid or aerosol form hasresulted in severe eye injuries, damage to the skin and injury of the mucousmembranes (U.S. EPA, 1988b). Most of the case histories of injuries resultingfrom exposure to sodium hydroxide involve the liquid or solid form. Thereare very few cases of health effects resulting from airborne exposure documentedin the literature (NIOSH, 1975). Sax (1984) reports that inhalation ofsodium hydroxide dust or concentrated mist can cause damage to the upperrespiratory tract and to lung tissue, depending on the extent of the exposure.The effects associated with inhalation exposure to sodium hydroxide maythus range from mild irritation to severe pneumonitis. In a study (Lewis,1974) of the effects of aerosol oven cleaners containing sodium hydroxide,respiratory irritation was perceived in healthy human volunteers at concentrationsof 0.24 to 1.8 mg/m3. Unfortunately, this study did not take into accountother potentially irritating ingredients of the aerosol.Acute exposures of animals have produced similar results to those of humans.Frank damage of the respiratory system was observed in rats following exposuresto aerosols generated from a 20 percent sodium hydroxide solution. Thesodium hydroxide concentration in the exposure chambers was not given.The only data regarding effects associated with chronic exposures comefrom an epidemiological study (Ott et al., 1977) of workers chronicallyexposed to sodium hydroxide dust ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 mg/m\3\. Thisstudy reported no statistically significant increased mortality in theexposed group. <ITAG tagnum="84">Monitored Ambient Concentrations</ITAG>No data on monitored ambient levels of sodium hydroxide could be foundin the available literature. <ITAG tagnum="84">Exposure Estimation</ITAG>The exposure assessment for sodium hydroxide relied upon dispersion modelingto estimate ambient concentrations near emission sources. However, giventhe extremely short atmospheric half-life of sodium hydroxide in the atmosphere,estimation of long-term ambient concentrations are not applicable. Consequently,the focus of this assessment was on short-term exposures. In order to assess the potential for adverse noncancer health effects fromshort-term exposure to sodium hydroxide, a conservative screening modelinganalysis was performed (U.S. EPA, 1985). The model employs a point sourceGaussian air dispersion model and applies several reasonable worst-caseassumptions for source location, emissions, meteorology and terrain. Althoughthe short-term screening model is designed to produce conservative estimatesof ambient concentrations, the emission rates used in this analysis arederived from estimates of annual releases and may not be representativeof short-term release rates. For this assessment, the largest emittingsources were selected and the maximum levels of sodium hydroxide that couldoccur near each plant were calculated. These results reflect the extremelyrapid atmospheric degradation of sodium hydroxide. The maximum concentrationswere estimated to be 0.02 and 0.01 mg/m\3\ for average times of 15 minutesand 24 hours respectively (U.S. EPA, 1988c). <ITAG tagnum="84">Risk Characterization</ITAG>Due to the paucity of data regarding health effects resulting from inhalationexposure to sodium hydroxide, it is difficult to derive a concentrationlevel below which no significant health effects would be expected in thegeneral population. For acute exposures, data from the study of oven cleaneraerosols containing sodium hydroxide would suggest that respiratory irritationcould be perceived at levels as low as 0.24 to 1.8 mg/m\3\. This study,however, is flawed due to the other potentially irritating ingredientsof the aerosol. The occupational exposure ceiling level developed by theAmerican Council of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) is 2.0 mg/m\3\.A ceiling level is a level not to be exceeded at any time in work placeair. The ACGIH documentation (ACGIH, 1986) referencing Patty (1949) statesthat 2 mg/m\3\ sodium hydroxide in air ``represents a concentration thatis noticeably, but not excessively irritant.'' The NIOSH also cite Patty(1949) and recommend a 2 mg/m\3\ limit as a 15 minute ceiling. In addition,the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has adopted anexposure level of 2 mg/m\3\ as an 8 hour time weighted average. Although sodium hydroxide is produced in great quantities in the UnitedStates, exposure to high concentrations in the ambient air is unlikelydue to its rapid atmospheric degradation (the atmospheric half life is13 seconds). The maximum modeled ambient sodium hydroxide concentrationis 0.02 mg/m\3\ (15 minute averaging period). Given the paucity of data regarding systemic or acute health effects andthe low potential for exposure to high concentrations of sodium hydroxide(due to its rapid atmospheric degradation), it is unlikely that routineemissions of sodium hydroxide pose a public health risk. <ITAG tagnum="84">Existing Regulations and Guidelines</ITAG>The NIOSH, OSHA, and ACGIH recommended ceiling level of 2 mg/m\3\ is discussedabove. Six other nations have also recommended workplace standards, forairborne sodium hydroxide (NIOSH 1975). All of these standards are equalto or near the NIOSH and ACGIH recommended level. Sodium hydroxide has been removed (53 FR 49688) from the list of compoundssubject to the reporting requirements of the Toxic Chemical Release Reporting,Community Right-to-Know rule (53 FR 4500), under section 313 of Title IIIof the Superfund Amendments and Reauthorization Act of 1986. Section 313requires that owners and operators of certain facilities that manufacture,import, process, or otherwise use certain toxic chemicals report annuallytheir releases of those chemicals to each environmental medium. In addition,certain suppliers of toxic chemicals must notify recipients of such chemicalsin mixtures and trade name products. <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusions</ITAG>The Agency concludes that the currently available data are insufficientto indicate health concerns that warrant specific Federal regulation ofroutine sodium hydroxide emissions under the CAA at this time. A numberof uncertainties, however, are associated with this conclusion. With regardto the health assessment, the health data are inadequate to judge sodiumhydroxide's carcinogenic potential in humans. Furthermore, there are virtuallyno dose-response data for noncancer health effects in humans, and the availableinhalation data from animals are minimal. Regarding the exposure assessment,EPA's techniques for estimating short-term concentrations resulting fromroutine emissions are based on screening models rather than on extensivesite-specific modeling. The concentrations estimated from the short-termmodeling exercise do not account for emissions resulting from intermittentor batch operations, thus providing a potential for underestimation ofshort-term concentrations. The rapid atmospheric half life of sodium hydroxide,however, has been incorporated into the exposure assessment. Ambient monitoringdata for sodium hydroxide were unavailable, in part due to its rapid atmosphericdegradation and the confounding effect of other sodium compounds in theatmosphere. Although EPA considers today's action appropriate in view of the currenthealth and exposure information, the Agency will continue to evaluate newdata as they become available. Furthermore, emissions of sodium hydroxide to the ambient air will alsobe evaluated in the context of multiple pollutant emissions from categoriesof related emission sources (source categories). The EPA invites comments and submission of information pertinent to thedetermination made today. A further notice will be published if publiccomments or other additional information suggest a need to reevaluate today'sfindings and revise EPA's conclusions. <ITAG tagnum="21">Date: January 6, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Don R.
