The May 11 incident, in which a Blackhawk flying near a hugeantenna farm banked into a right-hand turn for five seconds withoutany pilot commands, also has prompted the Army to instruct itspilots to keep clear of a handful of radio antenna installations inWest Germany.   Although the May 11 incident has raised new concerns about theeffects of so-called electromagnetic interference on the Blackhawk,extensive testing has convinced the service it is still dealingwith a ``nuisance'' problem and not a phenomenon that affectsflight safety, said Maj. Phil Soucy, an Army spokesman.   ``We certainly are not going to ground the fleet, becausethere's no reason to do so,'' Soucy added.   But Soucy said the Army intends to accelerate its plans to addshielding to the electronic controls on the craft's hydrauliccontrol system because of the test results. The service already hadopened talks with the helicopter's manufacturer, Sikorsky Aircraft,on shielding a number of electronic components ``because our pilotsshouldn't have to worry about nuisance'' signal interference, Soucysaid.   Last November, Knight-Ridder Newspapers reported investigatorswere convinced radio wave interference had caused five Blackhawkaccidents since 1982, killing 22 servicemen.   ``Radio waves in the air can penetrate the helicopter's wiringand electrical components and generate false commands that canrange from simply causing the craft's warning lights to flash tosending it into a fatal dive,'' the report said.   The Army and Sikorsky, a subsidiary of the United TechnologiesCorp., adamantly disputed that report, saying there was no evidenceelectromagnetic interference had caused any crashes.   The service had acknowledged earlier that radio waveinterference could cause ``uncommanded control inputs,'' moving thehelicopter's horizontal stabilator slightly, but not to the extentof posing a flight safety hazard. There is a switch in the cockpitthat allows a pilot to assume manual control of the stabilator, theArmy says.   Last month, a Blackhawk operating near a large array ofhigh-intensity antennas in West Germany experienced some unusualblinking lights and alarm horns, Soucy said. The Army thenattempted to replicate that incident with special instruments andtest pilots.   On May 11, during a test, ``the aircraft turned to the right onits own for about five seconds while flying near the antennafarm,'' Soucy said. ``We believe the hydraulic logic module insidethe Blackhawk was being affected.''   The spokesman declined to say how close the helicopter wasflying to the antenna farm, but said it was transmitting with acombined power in excess of 400 million watts of power.   While the test suggests that large levels of electromagneticinterference actually can affect the controls of the Blackhawk,``the effect is very brief'' and doesn't pose a threat of losingcontrol of the copter, Soucy said.   The Blackhawk is a twin-engine, single-rotor helicopter that isreplacing the aging UH-1 Huey copters of the Vietnam era as theArmy's primary air assault and air cavalry craft. It was introducedin April 1981.   The Army currently has more than 900 Blackhawks in its inventoryand plans to buy about 1,700 of the choppers. Each craft costsroughly $6 million.</TEXT></DOC>
