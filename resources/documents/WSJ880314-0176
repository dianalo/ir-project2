But today, no one wants variety anymore. According to TV-executive wisdom, the old song and dance is dead -- or at least crippled.    In the next few weeks, yet another music-oriented show, &quot;Tops of the Pops&quot; (CBS, Fridays, 11:30 p.m. EST), will bite the dust, canceled due to poor ratings. &quot;We've tried a truckload of these music programs,&quot; says Greg Kasparian, CBS's director of audience measurement. &quot;None of them did very well.&quot; &quot;Tops of the Pops,&quot; which Mr. Kasparian calls the network's &quot;best effort,&quot; garnered a lowly 2.3 rating. (By comparison, rerun made-for-TV dramas scored in the 3.9 range.)    &quot;Tops of the Pops&quot; isn't just any music show. In England, it's an institution, having aired for the past 24 years on BBC. It gave the first big TV break to fledgling pop music acts that are now legends: the Beatles, the Rolling Stones, the Who.    When &quot;Tops of the Pops&quot; came to the States last September, CBS had major-league hopes for it. Programmers had lined up all the big rock 'n' roll names, from old masters such as Mick Jagger and David Bowie to newer chart-toppers such as Bon Jovi and Pet Shop Boys. They threw in a flashy computer-graphic intro, lots of colored lights and very vocal crowds. It should have added up to a real hip hour.    Unfortunately, the program committed the worst of TV sins. It was dull. For some reason, all the acts blended together in droning monotony. And there were also some tragically inept moments, such as the band Loverboy's attempt to lip-synch its song &quot;Notorious&quot;; a harmonica solo rang out over the sound system while the musician was still fumbling to get the harmonica out of his pocket.    Part of the problem is what any video maker could tell you -- that very few popular performers are, in fact, performers. Many can posture or pout for a few seconds, but rare is the rocker with the slick moves of a David Bowie or the dynamo energy of a Mick Jagger. Whitesnake? Def Leppard? Give me a break. Frankly, there are few musicians of any kind -- rock, jazz, classical -- who have true visual presence.    And visuals, of course, are what TV is all about. The way MTV video directors get around the problem is by throwing in a lot of fancy effects and weird colors, and by cutting away from the performer every two or three seconds. If MTV feels energetic, even explosive, it's thanks to the editing, not the performances.    There are just a couple of contemporary musicians who are personalities, who can carry shows. Country star Dolly Parton is one. She's got the blondest of wigs, the falsest of eyelashes and a brand-new bodacious bod she's starved herself into. Dolly's sexy, she's charming and, best of all, she always looks as if she's having fun.    Now personally I find her variety show &quot;Dolly&quot; (ABC, Saturdays, 8:00 p.m. EST) a bit long on rustic schmaltz. Each week, Ms. Parton ends her program with such earnestly declared thoughts as &quot;You really can change the face of the world&quot; and &quot;I hope life will treat you real kind. . . .&quot;    Maybe I'm just an urban cynic, but I also don't get those &quot;good news&quot; moments, when members of the audience stand up and tell the world they won the lottery last month and isn't life great. And songs like &quot;Ride 'Em Cowboy&quot; and &quot;Hey, Could I Have Your Autograph?&quot; bore the pants off me.    But my musicial taste isn't really the point. The point is that Dolly has a sure-fire winning TV personality, and that millions and millions of people across the U.S. love country music. So why isn't the show's ranking in the Top Ten instead of down around number 44 (with a 13.4 rating)?    Maybe the TV execs are right. Maybe the audience has gotten bored with variety shows altogether. But I don't think so.    If, as pundits keep declaring, our attention span is getting shorter and shorter -- if we need all our information and entertainment in little bite-sized pieces nowadays -- then the variety show, with its Whitman Sampler approach to TV, should be a natural.    As it is, the comedy-oriented variety-type programs, from &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; through the long-running &quot;Saturday Night Live,&quot; have held up just fine over the years. In fact, the recent Smothers Brothers Reunion was so popular, CBS gave the brothers a commitment for a new variety show.    The problem, ratings-wise, appears to be not variety as much as music. Sad to say, it's the music-oriented shows that are hurting.    Now despite some of the bad performers described above, this isn't inevitable. Music has given TV some of its finest moments, from Elvis Presley on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; to Vladimir Horowitz in Moscow to Michael Jackson on Motown's 25th Anniversary Special. And there's a huge audience for music: Americans spend an astounding $4.65 billion a year on records, tapes and CDs (more than some countries' entire GNP).    What's needed is a new format -- a faster, flashier, more fragmented brand of variety -- and perhaps a few new stars who can really do the old song and dance. </TEXT></DOC>
