(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A coal company whose contract with theUnited Mine Workers includes a no-strike clause has fired 28 wildcatstrikers who refused to return to work, the first firings of thefour-week wildcat walkout, officials said today.   The company couldn't hold a formal hearing on the firings latethis morning in Beckley, because 2,000 UMW members blocked a meetinghall. Representatives of Toney's Branch Coal Co. and the UMW refusedto cross a picket line that surrounded the Raleigh County Armory.   Dismissal forms given the workers said they were fired forrefusing to cross pickets at Toney's Branch's mine in Racine. Thedelay in the formal hearing does not mean the firings are postponed.   ``This should tell them that all it's going to do is incite theworkers,'' UMW international executive board member Howard Greensaid in a telephone interview from Beckley.   Earlier, officials at Toney's Branch headquarters in Beckleyrefused to comment on the dismissals beyond saying the company was amember of the Bituminous Coal Operators Association, which inFebruary 1988 signed a UMW contract that included a no-strikeclause. A coal industry manual says there are 56 employees at theToney Branch's Racine mine, but does not specify how many are UMWmembers.   The dismissals are the first during a four-week wildcat sympathystrike by UMW members backing colleagues at the Pittston Co. whohave been on strike since April. Pittston, unlike most other coalcompanies, has no contract with the UMW, and the union hassanctioned that strike but not the wildcat walkout at othercompanies.   As many as 46,000 miners in 10 states have stayed off the job atone time or another since the unauthorized walkouts began June 12.Today, about 37,000 miners in eight states were off their jobs.   A two-week vacation period for many miners ends at midnightSunday and several locals have discussed or plan to considerreturning to work, fearing what happened to the Toney's Branchminers.   ``Some of them think if this goes down the drain, miners might bein bad shape _ they (coal companies) might bust the union,'' saidCharlie Greer, the president of a UMW local that representsZanesville, Ohio-area miners.   U.S. Sen. Robert Byrd said Thursday he wanted Labor SecretaryElizabeth Dole to step in and help end the strikes.   Byrd, D-W.Va., said Dole should ask UMW President Richard Trumkaand Pittston Chairman Paul Douglas to settle their organizations'differences so that 1,900 striking Pittston miners can return towork.   The union and the company haven't been at the bargaining tablefor several weeks now.</TEXT></DOC>
