The Navy denied it had ever tried to cover up news of theaccident, describing it as a minor mishap in which ``there were noserious injuries or radiological problems, the ship remained fullycapable to perform any mission required of it and there was nodamage to the reactor.''   The service acknowledged, however, that the incident had neverbeen publicized, and spokesmen were unable to say why the sub'sdeck logs and official command history made no mention of it.   ``The Navy had a major nuclear accident and then lied aboutit,'' asserted William Arkin, a researcher with the Institute forPolicy Studies, a liberal Washington think tank. ``We caught themwith their bellbottoms down.''   Arkin and Handler, a researcher who heads the Greenpeaceenvironmental group's Nuclear Free Seas Campaign, released theirfindings Monday. The Institute for Policy Studies and Greenpeaceare about to publish a study of serious naval accidents around theworld.   ``According to the deck logs of the USS Guardfish for April 21,1973, which we obtained, the submarine was `Underway submerged asbefore' for the entire day, without incident,'' Arkin said.   ``In fact, the submarine suffered a primary coolant leak ... andthen surfaced, ventilated, decontaminated and repaired its reactorunassisted. Five crewmen were later sent to the Puget Sound, Wash.,Naval Hospital for radiation monitoring.''   Willis S. Rich, the sub's skipper at the time and now aprofessor of engineering at Boston University, said in an interviewabout the report that had he noticed there was nothing in the logabout the accident, he would have told the navigator to add theinformation.   ``It was a minor mishap,'' he said. ``Nobody was injured. But itwas a primary coolant leak and you can't take that lightly.''   Earlier this month, the two researchers disclosed new detailsabout the loss of a hydrogen bomb off the coast of Japan in 1965.   Lt. Cmdr. Craig Quigley, a Navy spokesman, responded: ``We didnot try to cover anything up. Everything about this incident wasproperly reported through Navy channels.   ``Now, it's true we don't issue a press release every timesomething breaks down. That depends, for example, on whether thereis a hazard to people, a hazard to the environment or danger to thepublic.''   Quigley said he had not seen the deck logs obtained by Arkin andHandler under the Freedom of Information Act and would notspeculate on why they made no mention of a mishap.   He did, however, release a statement outlining exactly whathappened that day 16 years ago aboard the Guardfish, a Permit-classattack submarine that is still in service and based at San Diego,Calif.   ``While transiting from Pearl Harbor to Bangor (Wash.), acrewman was performing a tightness check of a small valve andinadvertently set up a path that allowed for a minor loss ofprimary coolant (water) through a test fitting opening ofone-quarter inch in diameter,'' the statement said.   ``Within about 10 minutes, the ship stopped the leak. Theestimated amount of coolant released was less than five gallons.''   In such cases, ``it is standard practice for a submarine tosurface ... in order to ventilate the spaces overboard'' and theGuardfish did just that, the statement continued.   Five sailors were subsequently found ``to have low levels ofradioactivity on their skin from the leak.''   ``Each crewman had the radioactivity removed by washing withsoap and water. The maximum radiation exposure ... was similar towhat he would have received in getting a common chest X-ray.   ``When the ship reached Bangor, these five crewmen weremonitored for internally deposited radioactivity. ... The resultsshowed that none of the crewmen involved had ingested anydetectable radioactivity.''   Rich, who retired as a captain, said he was not surprised thedeck logs made no mention of the incident ``because deck logs for asubmarine are a general synopsis at a lower classification, whereasthe quartermaster's notebook and patrol report would be moredefinitive and classified.''</TEXT></DOC>
