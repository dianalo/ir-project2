Despite positive news developments for gold last week, current-delivery prices have drifted lower for five days in a row, closing yesterday at $448.90 an ounce, down $2, on New York's Commodity Exchange.    &quot;It's been very dull. The interest in this market just isn't there,&quot; said Robert Radoccia, bullion trader for Union Bank of Switzerland's New York branch.    Other precious metals slid along with gold. Comex silver for current delivery closed yesterday at $6.355 an ounce, down five cents, and platinum on the New York Mercantile Exchange finished $2.90 an ounce lower, at $515.90.    James Riley, chief bullion dealer at J. Aron andamp; Co., the metal-trading unit of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co., said he has noticed &quot;a little bit of disillusionment&quot; from gold bulls in the past week. There has been bullish news such as tensions in the Persian Gulf and last week's Labor Department report that consumer prices rose 0.5% in March, an inflationary sign.    But instead of rallying, the market fell. &quot;I think the inability of the market to move higher with all the bullish news has left a bit of a bad taste with the people who are the bulls of the market,&quot; Mr. Riley said.    He said part of the problem may be that various world-wide gold producers are more aggressive in their hedging of future production. Heavy selling of gold for delivery several years from now has had a depressing impact on current prices. &quot;The market right now is having to handle not only the standard annual production from the largest producers, but also production from the early 1990s,&quot; Mr. Riley said.    Some traders complain that unlike the late 1970s, when investors seeking an inflation refuge generally ran to gold and silver, today many appear to be turning to such inflation-related contracts as crude oil or Eurodollar futures.    In any case, Mr. Radoccia suggested the market is ready for a mild advance caused by short covering, or buying by traders who had earlier bet prices would drop but think the bottom has been hit. Such short covering could possibly be triggered by today's Commerce Department initial estimate of first-quarter economic growth, depending on its inflation implications, he said.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   COPPER: Prices fell as soft demand continued. May-delivery copper was off 2.65 cents a pound, to 90.95 cents, on New York's Commodity Exchange. The price eased despite the fact that London Metal Exchange warehouse inventories were 750 tons lower last week, to 48,250 tons, and Comex stocks Friday were off 226 tons, to 9,642 tons. A drop in the British pound created some pressure on prices as London traders bought copper futures there and sold contracts in New York. One analyst, noting that the May contract didn't fall below the 90-cents support level, said: &quot;But you never know, 90 cents might be vulnerable.&quot; He said copper supplies, while more ample that before, still remain relatively tight. &quot;It's the demand side of the market that's making its presence, or lack of it, felt,&quot; he said. Supplies are apparently adequate for immediate needs and buyers for copper-using industries aren't anxious to enter the market for more metal, particularly with summer approaching, he said. Summer is usually the lowest consuming period of the year.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Prices slipped across the board as weekend rains damped speculation about dry conditions in the Midwest and Southwest, said Victor Lespinasse, a floor broker for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago. The futures markets are particularly sensitive to weather reports this planting season because U.S. stockpiles are falling. Wheat prices were pressured by Candamp;D Commodities, a Chicago futures-trading concern, which sold contracts at the Chicago Board of Trade for roughly 7.5 million bushels of wheat, one analyst said. Soybean prices are feeling the effect of hedging against the Brazilian harvest, now under way. Brazilian elevators and cooperatives sell soybean-futures contracts to hedge against soybeans they buy on the spot market from farmers.    ENERGY: Crude-oil prices fell slightly in most countries but rose slightly in the U.S. in light trading. Many traders are on the sidelines awaiting news from today's meeting in Vienna between members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and several non-OPEC producers. The June-delivery contract on the New York Mercantile Exchange closed at $18.40 a barrel, up 10 cents. Heating oil rose, but unleaded gasoline for May lagged other energy contracts, closing at 52.05 cents a gallon, down 0.24 cent. Traders said an apparent gasoline glut in the Northeast has put pressure on prices. Meanwhile, several oil companies raised the price they pay for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, by 50 cents a barrel, to $17.50 a barrel.    SUGAR: Prices rose amid revived rumors that the Soviet Union is interested in buying sugar. The July contract advanced 0.23 cent a pound, to 9.04 cents, on the Coffee, Sugar andamp; Cocoa Exchange. According to one trade source, there is talk among trade houses that the Soviet Union has been trying to buy sugar through trade firms, but no deals have been completed because terms haven't been favorable enough for the firms. As a result, there is speculation the Soviets might try to obtain supplies by taking delivery of futures, which isn't their normal mode of operation. The source emphasized, &quot;It's the kind of rumor that can't be confirmed or denied, the kind that goes on all the time.&quot; One analyst said that &quot;when a major buyer, such as Russia, China or India, are thought to be coming into the market, it creates an impact.&quot; The rumor may have prompted what one analyst described as &quot;a rash of buying by funds.&quot;    LIVESTOCK AND MEATS: Cattle-futures prices closed mixed in the wake of a Friday report by the Agriculture Department that more cattle than expected were placed on feedlots last month. While private analysts had expected a 2% increase in feedlot placements in the monthly census of seven major cattle states, the department reported a 7% rise. The department also said the number of cattle slaughtered in March grew only 1%, while most trade estimates had pegged a 5% rise. The report indicates the number of cattle on feedlots is growing, which would tend to depress prices. &quot;We may have seen our highs for the first half of the year,&quot; said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp., Arlington Heights, Ill. &quot;I see choppy prices overall.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
