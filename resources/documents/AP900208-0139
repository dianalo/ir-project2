The grainy blue-gray footage, taken during the post-midnightattack on Dec. 20, looks like a Fourth of July fireworks display,with white streams of tracer bullets spraying about and whiteflashes of explosives bursting around the buildings.   Rounds from the AC-130 gunship carrying out the assault can beseen striking roofs and blowing out windows.   Fires are visible in several structures after the attack.   The four-engine turboprop AC-130 aircraft is armed with threekinds of weapons _ a 105mm howitzer, a 40mm Bofors cannon and a20mm Vulcan cannon. The tape was made as the plane hovered a fewhundred feet in the air pouring fire on various targets and snipers.   The tape, made from footage retrieved from the gunship's owncamera monitoring system, was released following requests made bytelevision networks.   Pentagon spokesman Pete Williams said the pictures had beencensored to remove sensitive information.   While most of the footage portrays the attack on the PanamanianDefense Force's headquarters known as the Comandancia, it alsoshows a Panamanian armored personnel carrier taking a direct hitand an attack on a barracks, where a palm tree is toppled by hitsfrom the 105mm cannon.   Pentagon officials said the AC-130 gunship was chosen for itsaccuracy, and its ability to avoid damage to nearby buildings andU.S. troops in the area.</TEXT></DOC>
