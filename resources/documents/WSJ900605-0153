As many as eight Japanese banks had been expected tofollow Bank of Tokyo after it announced plans in May to opena representative office in Taiwan. But after criticism ofthose plans by People's Bank of China late last week, theother Japanese banks got the message &quot;not to go to Taiwannow,&quot; according to the managing director of a large Japanesebank in Hong Kong.</LP><TEXT>   A Bank of Tokyo spokesman said the bank still intends toopen a Taipei office. But he said that the issue is &quot;verysensitive&quot; and that bank officials are conferring this weekon those plans and China's reaction.   A Bank of Tokyo official in Hong Kong said the bank hopesthe controversy dies down so the Taipei office can quietlyopen in July as planned, but he conceded that some executivesin Tokyo want to reconsider the move.   Bank of Tokyo's move into Taiwan surprised bankinganalysts. Though Japanese banks long ago recognized theisland's economic potential, relations with China had alwaysbeen considered too sensitive to risk establishing directcommercial ties with Taiwan, which China continues to claimis part of its territory. Many Japanese banks have used HongKong subsidiaries to do business with Taiwan.   If Bank of Tokyo goes ahead, it would be the firstJapanese bank to enter Taiwan since Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank setup an office in 1960. Dai-Ichi Kangyo's ties to Taiwan havekept it barred from doing any substantial business with Chinain the past three decades.   Still, Japanese authorities apparently thought the timemight be right for a change in policy. Japanese banks havedone little business with China in the past year because of agovernment curb on new loans since the Chinese government'smassacre of pro-democracy demonstrators in Beijing last June.Meanwhile, Taiwan's economy has remained robust, and economicrelations between China and Taiwan appeared to be improving.   In addition, some large Japanese securities companies hadreceived clearance from Tokyo to buy into Taipei brokeragefirms. But unlike the banks, which have extensive loansoutstanding to China and hope eventually to resumesubstantial lending, the securities firms have littlebusiness with China and so can't be as easily pressured, aJapanese banker in Hong Kong said.   However, the Japanese banks haven't given up on Taiwan, hesaid. They are merely waiting &quot;for a more appropriate time.&quot;A spokesman for Japan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs saidgoing into Taiwan is a &quot;private decision for the banks tomake.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
