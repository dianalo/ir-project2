(Integrated Measurement Systems'Logic Master XL enhancements)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Harding, Bill.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>Integrated Measurement Systems Inc is enhancing its Logic MasterXL application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) verificationsystem with new mixed-signal and scan-test modules.andP;  Themixed-signal device supports verification of ASICs with bothanalog and digital elements.andP;  It combines a Logic Master XL withuser-selected bus instruments and a mixed-signal matrix fixture.andO;The new scan test module lets the Logic Master supportverification of designs using scan path, scan set, random-accessscan, boundary scan and other common scan techniques.andP;  It allowsengineers to move back and forth between various testingoperations when verifying ASIC prototypes.andP;  The mixed signalmodule will cost $60,000 as an add-on and $120,000 to $200,000 fora complete system; the add-on scan module is priced at $33,000.andO;Both modules are expected to ship by the end of 1989.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Company:   Integrated Measurement Systems Inc.
