It takes less time.andP;  Turn on data compression in a backupprogram, and backups take longer, since the PC must compress the data beforesending it to the backup disk or tape.andM;Hardware-based compression goes after this problem more directly.andP;  If adata-compression coprocessor can keep up with the rest of the system, thereis no time penalty.andP;  And given that the bottleneck in tape backup is oftenthe speed with which the data is written to the tape, compressing the filescan actually speed backups.andM;WHAT WE FOUNDandM;Two of the tape drives we evaluated--Tallgrass Technologies' FS 150e andColorado Memory Systems' QFA500--offer data-compression options.andP;  Althoughboth use STAC's STACPACK data-compression algorithm, Tallgrass' package usesit in software, while Colorado Memory Systems includes a STAC chip as part ofthe hardware.andP;  (The InfoChip Systems and Hewlett-Packard chips will beavailable as part of other backup products by the end of 1990.)andM;On PC Labs' file-by-file portion of the Full Disk Backup test, both systemsoffered approximately a 2:1 compression ratio.andP;  However, software-basedTallgrass' backup speeds were 1.3 to 1.5 times slower with compression thanwithout it.andP;  Colorado Memory Systems QFA500 took about 20 percent less timeto complete our backup and restore tests with its compression option enabled.andM;According to Colorado Memory Systems, the STAC chip has the potential toincrease backup speed by as much as 40 percent.andP;  Due to the nature of ourtests, its performance was hampered by a software feature.andM;The QFA500's software keeps track of the hard disk's directory structureduring a backup.andP;  Normally, this is handled in RAM.andP;  But since our testsinvolve more than 1,500 files, the program was forced to write to disk, whichslowed the backup.andP;  Colorado Memory Systems is modifying the software so thatit will allow the use of LIM EMS memory, if available, before writing to thedisk.andM;WHICH ONE WILL FLY? I  t's clear that hardware-based data compression is hereto stay.andP;  Far less clear is whose data compression scheme you're most likelyto wind up using.andM;Odds are that all three schemes win succeed to sonic extent.andP;  STAC is anofficial QIC specification  (QIC-122).andP;  The Hewlett-Packard Mystic chip hasan established following, since it's basically an updated version of theMagic chip that HP has been shipping in 9-track reel-to-reel systems since1987.andP;  The Infochip IC-105 is appealing because it will provide datacompression for your whole system.andP;  If it works as advertised, it'lleffectively double disk drive and backup capacity--and it should be a lotcheaper than buying a new hard disk!andO;</TEXT></DOC>
