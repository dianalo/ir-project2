The report on toxic substances, poisonous materials released bychemical plants and other industries, is the first comprehensivelook at them. Many have been linked to cancer, birth defects,reproductive dysfunctions, neurological disorders and geneticmutations.   Among the 328 individual and classes of chemicals surveyed were60 government-identified cancer-causing agents; methyl isocyanate,the toxic gas that killed at least 3,400 people and injured some20,000 in Bhopal, India, in December 1984; and phosgene, a nerve gasused in World War I.   ``The magnitude of this problem far exceeds our worst fears,''said Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif., who released the preliminaryEnvironmental Protection Agency figures for 1987 at a newsconference with Reps. Mickey Leland, D-Texas; Jim Florio, D-N.J.,and Gerry Sikorski, D-Minn.   Waxman said the EPA ``has broken commitment after commitment todeal with this problem'' during the 19-year life of the Clean AirAct, and all four lawmakers said they'll soon introduce legislationto force the EPA to control these emissions.   Only seven of the substances are now regulated by the EPA,although a separate agency, the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration, has set standards for more than 400 toxics in theworkplace.   Donald Clay, EPA's top official on air quality issues,acknowleged that more should be done to protect against toxicpollutants but said the agency has been hamstrung in dealing with320 separate chemicals one at a time under current law.   ``The idea of going down 320 (separate) rules ... is just toocumbersome'' especially since in many cases industry can be expectedto contest tighter restrictions in the courts, Clay told reporters,adding that ``some other approach is needed.''   He suggested, for example, dealing with the toxic emissions on a``source'' basis instead of each chemical separately as required bythe 1970 law that envisioned far fewer toxic chemicals than nowbeing released.   As to the preliminary EPA figures released by Waxman, Clayacknowleged the volume of pollutants were greater than he hadexpected. ``It's a big number. I think it's a health problem thatneeds to be addressed.''   EPA, meanwhile, released its annual report on air quality, andconcluded more than 100 million Americans live in areas where theybreathe unhealthy air, with pollutants exceeding federal standards.   EPA said ozone pollution and carbon monoxide emissions, bothlargely caused by automobiles, remain a major problem, especially inurban areas.   Ozone levels increased 5 percent from 1986 to 1987 and, largelybecause of the unusual heat last summer, jumped another 14 percentin 1988, according to the EPA statistics covering 1978 to 1987 forfive pollutants and through last year for ozone.   EPA did, however, note a long-term reduction of all six of thepollutants surveyed.   The comprehensive information on toxics was collected for thefirst time under a ``community right to know'' amendment to thenation's Superfund law that passed in the House by a single vote in1986.   Information was shown on a state-by-state basis but Sikorski saidmore localized information has been given to each state, to informresidents of a community about emissions from their local plants.   Texas led the nation with 229.9 million pounds of toxic emissionsin 1987, compared with 134.5 million pounds for the next higheststate, Louisiana. Tennessee was third with l32.4 million pounds,Virginia fourth with 131.3 million pounds and Ohio fifth with 122.4million pounds.   Hawaii had the lowest toxic emissions, 957.7 pounds, with Nevadathe next lowest with 1.2 million.   The chemical industry led the way in toxic emissions with 886.5million pounds released, followed by the primary metals, paper,transportation equipment and rubber-plastics industries.   EPA-regulated toxics are arsenic, asbestos, benzene, beryllium,mercury, radon-222, and vinyl. Of these, only benzene is among thetop 25 chemicals emitted, according to the National WildlifeFederation, which issued a separate report based on the EPA figures.   The four House members said the toxics situation may be evenworse than now known, because the information is based on industry'sown estimates and not on actual monitoring.   The inventory only included toxics sent directly into the airsupply, not the millions of pounds released into surface waters orsoil which eventually evaporate into the air. Nor did the surveyinclude releases from small sources, such as dry cleaners and gasstations.</TEXT></DOC>
