MILLER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PANAMA CITY (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Panama, skating on the edge of a fiscaldisaster, was awaiting word from private bankers this week onwhether they will accept a bailout scheme that could keep thecountry out of default.   Ricaurte Vasquez, Panama's planning minister, met in New Yorklate last week with a committee representing 150 commercial bankcreditors in a new effort to keep the country afloat by delayingloan interest payments.   Panama owes the private banks $200 million in interest thisyear, with the bulk of it scheduled to come due in mid-March. Butthe country's dollar reserves are virtually depleted and it isunlikely it can meet its commitments.   Vasquez first met with the creditor committee in December andasked that $100 million of the interest due this year be added tothe principal for future payment. The bankers were said to haveshown little interest in that plan.   It was not known if Vasquez offered the bankers a new bailoutplan last week, but he said recently that his government might haveto dismiss as many as 15,000 public employees next month to reduceits cash flow.   One out of every four Panamanian workers is employed by thegovernment, many owing their jobs to loyalty to the DemocraticRevolutionary Party, which has close ties to the country's de factoleader, Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.   ``Much of what little popularity Noriega still retains comesfrom the public sector,'' said a Western diplomat. ``If thegovernment is forced to make layoffs in that sector, it obviouslywon't help Noriega's image.''   Noriega has been under pressure to resign since last summer froma broad but loose coalition known as the National Civic Crusade. Itcounts more than 200 civic, business, professional, labor and othergroups as members.   The opposition's charges of corruption against Noriega weregiven added weight earlier this month when he was indicted byfederal grand juries in Miami and Tampa, Fla., on charges of drugsmuggling, money laundering and racketeering.   The general, who dominates the counry's civilian government ashead of Panama's Defense Forces, sent his army into the streetslast year to quell demonstrations by the Civic Crusade, and theopposition has increasingly turned to what one official called``economic warfare.''   The tactics, which have added to the government's fiscal woes,include removal of deposits from state banks and the avoidance orlate payment of utility fees and taxes. The Civic Crusade also hascalled several nationwide strikes, but none has been particularlysuccessful.   ``The Crusade's activities are an annoyance, I'm sure,'' saidthe diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity. ``But that's areally small part of Panama's problem.''   The problem, which Noriega inherited, comes from a huge publicdebt rolled up by a predecessor, Gen. Omar Torrijos, who came topower in a 1968 coup and began an ambitious program of buildingschools, health clinics, roads and other public facilities.   The World Bank put Panama's total foreign debt at $4.8 billionat the end of 1986, the latest year for which figures areavailable. The U.S. Commerce Department says the governmentdeclared itself in ``informal, indefinite default'' to allgovernmental lenders last year, meaning it made no interest orprincipal payments.   The United States halted all aid to Panama's government lastyear, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund alsocut off lending programs pending compliance by Panama with an IMFdemand for a restructuring of its social security programs.   Diplomats and private economists say the government has beenloathe to make the reforms for fear of losing further popularsupport, particularly among the lower and middle classes whobenefit most from the programs.   The government's fiscal crisis appears to have had little effecton the private economy, particularly among the more than 120foreign banks that maintain offices here and make Panama one of theWestern Hemisphere's largest banking centers.   ``The banking sector could face problems if the crisis deepensbecause it is highly dependent on a sense of confidence andstability,'' the diplomat said. ``But so far there have been nofailures, nobody has pulled out and deposits remain relativelystable.''</TEXT></DOC>
