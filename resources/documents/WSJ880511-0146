Banks </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><DATELINE> Tucson, Ariz.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Since he began playing cowboy polo 26 years ago, Eddie Sorensen has had four operations, a broken leg, several cracked ribs, a separated shoulder, and a batch of concussions. The first one knocked him out for a day and a half. When he came to, the doctor told him another concussion could kill him. &quot;But he was lyin',&quot; Sorensen says. &quot;I've had three since then.&quot;    Once he got whacked under the jaw with a mallet, leaving a perfect imprint of all his teeth on his tongue.    Three years ago, caution got hold of the 51-year-old mobile-home mover and owner of a tack shop here. He sold his horse and hung up his spurs. Retirement lasted a year. It was torture. &quot;I ain't even gonna try quittin' anymore,&quot; Sorensen says. &quot;I love the game too much.&quot;    Cowboy polo is a kind of good ol' boy spinoff of English polo. It is played on a dirt arena, 260 feet long by 120 feet wide, with goals on both ends. A match consists of four 15-minute periods called chukkers. Each team fields five riders. What makes it different from the more genteel European variety is that cowboy polo players must remain in one of five zones, which generates much more physical contact. Riders pass the ball from man to man, and use their horse to bump their opponents' horses out of the way. English polo players can gallop the length of the field without running into anything.    Also, the ball used in English polo travels long distances when struck with a mallet. The cowboy ball, a 13-inch soft-rubber playground ball, doesn't, so less time is spent galloping after it and more time jostling for possession.    &quot;English polo is martinis and crumpets,&quot; says Tucson carpenter LeRoy Neville, president of the National Cowboy Polo Association. &quot;We're beer and hamburgers. It's a little bit like hockey on horseback.&quot; Neville should know. He played for 20 years, retiring a year and a half ago after, he says, &quot;having my eyebrows wiped off two or three times.&quot;    The game got its start in Florida in 1952, when it was called palmetto polo. Some palmetto players broke away from that group in 1959 and formed the Cowboy Polo Association. Neville says the rebel group wanted to make polo into a working man's sport that didn't require a string of horses to play. They did away with tournament entry fees, dumped some frivolous rules and have been going strong in nine states from Oregon and California to Texas and Alabama ever since.    To say that cowboy polo has a macho image is an understatement. Until a hotly debated rule change in the early '70s, wearing helmets was against regulations. A cowboy hat was the only acceptable headwear. Now players have the option of wearing a helmet or not. &quot;Used to be, if you wore a helmet you were a weenie,&quot; says Sorensen. &quot;That's changed now.&quot; But some holdouts still ride into the arena sporting soft white Stetsons, which provide scant protection against opponents wielding 60-inch fiberglass mallets with hard rubber heads. To maintain its cowboy image, the association still requires riders to wear western shirts, jeans and boots.    Why anyone of sound mind would take up such a dangerous sport is hard to figure. But an afternoon spent with players yields two constants: a love of fast horses and a need for high impact. In short, fun. Carol Jennings, 30, the owner of a housecleaning business and the only woman on the Tucson team, says: &quot;I wouldn't recommend the game to anyone. You don't get nothin' out of it. Except pleasure.&quot;    Part of that pleasure seems to be boasting about polo injuries. LeRoy Neville knows where most of his hurts are by memory. He points to a scar over his left eye: &quot;This here's Albuquerque.&quot; Then to another scar: &quot;This one's Santa Fe.&quot; And another, between his eyes: &quot;Right here's Chet White. And that was in practice.&quot;    White, as far as anyone knows, was the oldest player ever to take up the game. He started at 65 and played 10 years. He is 78 now, and wears a turquoise-studded bolo tie on the sidelines as he watches youngsters mix it up in the arena under a mushroom cloud of dust. &quot;I belonged to a riding club and felt like I needed more action,&quot; he says. &quot;I played cowboy polo once and was hooked.&quot; He quit when he got cataracts.    Aside from good health and reflexes and crazy daring, the critical ingredient for any player is his horse. Even a rider highly skilled with a mallet can't compete if he isn't mounted. A good horse can cost up to $2,500 and requires two years of training before he is ready to play. Quarter horses are best, and maturity counts. Even a fast, athletic horse doesn't reach prime polo age until he is at least 10 years old, and many play up to 25 years and older. Younger horses are easily spooked in the wild swinging of mallets and intense jostling that goes on during competition.    All of which places a premium on protecting the horse. As Scottie Sorensen, Eddie's boy, says, &quot;The other guy can womp on me all he wants, but we take care of our horses.&quot;    As a result, they're rarely injured. Eddie Sorensen says that in all the time he's been playing he's seen only two horses hurt. One suffered a broken shoulder when it fell down, without being hit, and another dropped dead of a heart attack in the end zone after its rider scored a goal during the national championships in Colorado several years back.    &quot;We drug her off and buried her, and they put up a monument to her right there in the end zone,&quot; Sorensen says. &quot;She was a awful good pony.&quot;    ---   Mr. Banks is a free-lance writer based in Tucson. </TEXT></DOC>
