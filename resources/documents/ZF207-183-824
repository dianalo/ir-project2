 Speaking at the annual computer science conference ofthe US Association for Computing Machinery in Louisville, Kentucky, ProfessorAiso explained that the Automatic Telephone Interpretation Research Projectbeing conducted by the Advanced Telecommunications Research Institute inJapan is one of many computer-related projects being funded by privateindustry and the Japanese government, reports Microbytes Daily.andP;  Thetelephone project includes work on speech recognition, machine translation inreal time, and speech synthesis.andP;  Ideal for monolingual people makingtelesales calls to other countries, the system could come into use as soon as1992 in a limited way.andP;  The aim of the project is to demonstrate such adevice with a limited vocabulary of between 1,000 and 3,000 commonly-usedbusiness words by then.andP;  Other major projects being funded by MITI, theJapanese Ministry for International Trade and Industry include $8m forresearch into three-dimensional integrated circuits made up of four layersthat include organic materials, as part of the national effort to create aneural network system simlar to the nervous system of lower forms of life.andO;There is $23m for a project to develop memory chips with access times of lessthan 10nS - there are already statics that have access times as low as 2nS,but they are expensive and have only thousands of memory cells per chip.andP;  Thechips are primarily for use in supercomputers.andP;  The third stage of theInstitute for Computers Of Tomorrow effort involves the creation of aknowledge-based, multi-processor computer capable of surpassing theperformance of the current generation of supercomputers; work is proceedingon a 64-processor machine programmed in a hybrid language based on Prolog,but ultimately the machine could have as many as 10,000 processing elements.andO;$100m has been budgeted for this project, with completion set for 1991.andO;There is $20m being devoted to the development of advanced robots by 1990,among them a nuclear-powered robot, a robot designed to operate on thesea-bed, and a disaster-prevention robot.andP;  &quot;The robots are designed to workwhere man cannot go; in nuclear power plants, or in dangeroushigh-temperature disasters such as factory fires involving chemicals,&quot; Aisonoted.andP;  &quot;The robot projects are also contributing to other research, such asin pattern recognition.&quot;andP;  France and Spain are working with the Japanese inthe robotic research.andP;  The $25m Sigma project to create standard workstationsand a methdology for efficient software development is continuing, andanother $20m has been budgeted over seven years to create an interoperabledatabase system and to work towards standardisation of distributed databases.andO;There is $6m for the development of a machine translation system forautomatic conversion of the leading Asian languages - including Korean,Chinese, Indonesian, Japanese and Thai, into English.andM;Human Frontier ScienceandM;The Future Personal Informatonal Environment Development '21 project has a$13m budget to create a new information processing system with advancedJapanese-language capability by 1993.andP;  And the latest newest national projectto be approved, just a few months ago, is the Human Frontier ScienceProgramme, with $80m budgeted over the next 20 years: the aim is to studybrain functions with the goal of creating a neurocomputer by looking atbiological functions at the molecular level - and the directors have decidedto open an office here in London for the research.andP;   &quot;The three elements ofthe study will be computational neuroscience, technology, and current neuralcomputer science,&quot; Aiso said.andP;  The Japanese government is also watching withinterest the privately-funded Tron real time operating nucleus developmentprogramme, and the Laboratory for International Fuzzy Engineering Research,backed by 46 companies, which seeks to create the hardware, software, andarchi.andP;  cw 8 tecture for computers that can handle imprecise information andmake intelligent best-guesses.andP;  The major application, Aiso suggested, wouldbe in robots that would be able to make decisions for themselves.andP;  Among the46 private investors in the program is the US National Aeronautics andamp; SpaceAdministration's Johnson Space Center, Aiso noted.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
