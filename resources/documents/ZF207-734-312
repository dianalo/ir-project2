 They all inherit characteristics from the superclassof object-oriented databases, but it would be misleading to compare themclosely when most are still unreleased.andP;  One vendor's support of a feature isanother's non-interference with a user's doing it himself, and one vendor'sRelease 1.0 may be less finished than another vendor's beta product:Ontologic, for example, is shipping Ontos in October, but many of the goodieswill come in February.andP;  To summarize: Every vendor plans to supporteverything in some future release...but none has enough of a track record yetto earn full credence.andP;  The dates after the titles show our estimates ofcommercial ship dates, except where company dates are supplied in the text,and are subject to change, except for those that read 1988.andM;Altair/0 sub 2 -- A commercial consortium (1991) GIP Altair is a French jointventure owned by a commercial software house, IN2 (49 percent); INRIA, theInstitut National de Recherche en Informatiques et en Automatique (46percent); and LRI, the Laboratoire de Recherche en Informatique ofUniversite' de Paris-Sud (5 percent), which decided to fund the $20-million,five-year &quot;database for the 90s&quot; research project in 1986.andP;  One third of thebudget (without equity) comes from the European Community's Eureka project,through funding it supplied to IN2.andP;  IN2 is the Continent's biggest vendor ofPick applications and hardware (its own 68000 systems and Siemens equipment),with about $200 million in annual sales.andP;  It was recently acquired bySiemens, but the project is small-potatoes enough by Siemens standards tohave been left alone.andM;Besides, the end is in sight.andP;  Leader Francois Bancilhon has just set histeam of 30 developers (out of 45 people) to work on turning the currentprototype into a product, 02, for beta release a year from now and commercialrelease in mid-1991.andP;  Altair combines the best of two worlds, with thepragmatism of its Pick background (a mini-based, friendly operating systemthat has its own relational database) and the finances and freedom to go outand hire 15 PhDs, including (for a year) WiSS project leader Dave DeWitt andDave Maier, another OODB wizard who consults for Object Design and ServioLogic.andP;  Bancilhon once worked with Orion's Won Kim at MCC (on a predecessorproject) and is using a modification of the University of Wisconsin's WiSS(under license) for the underlying storage system.andM;The initial prototype, VO, was built to be thrown away and was delivered latein 1987.andP;  The current prototype, VI, running, needs a rewrite to become aworking product: &quot;We will add performance and robustness, other things weknow how to do now and didn't know the first time,&quot; says Bancilhon.andP;  0 sub 2will run on Sun workstations, both as server and clients, and will have aruntime component that supports dumb terminals.andP;  However, in its firstrelease it will still run Only as a single-server System.andM;The System works With an extended C language, C0 sub 2, or BASIC 0 sub 2,like query language.andP;  Development tools include debuggers, a graphicalbrowser and a toolbox/class library of typical commercial objects such asdates, names, and units of measurement.andP;  0 sub 2 has an overall commercialflavor to it, starting with its support for BASIC and attention tointegration with other languages, databases and application structures.andM;The system offers object-level pessimistic concurrency control, with somefiner-grained concurrency for metadata; for example, it's okay to add twomethods to a class simultaneously, but not for two processes (applications orusers) to update an instance simultaneously.andP;  The system has enough semanticinformation to know what's allowable there, but it can't really comprehendwhat a user is doing with the instances, and whether the updates mightconflict.andP;  &quot;With instances, we just do what a normal relational system woulddo,&quot; says Bancilhon.andM;Artemis/Orion II -- The commercial version (1990)andM;Artemis, a Control Data subsidiary, is the first company to attempt to make aproduct from MCC's Orion technology (below).andP;  The unit has start-up fundingfrom Control Data and was founded by Doug Barry, formerly CDC's liaison toMCC and a research scientist specializing in database technology.andP;  Its firsttask, says Barry, is to turn Orion from a research prototype into acommercial product.andP;  &quot;They left lots of simple things undone,&quot; he says,&quot;because they weren't interesting as research issues.&quot; However, they areniceties customers care about -- such as handling media failures as well assoftware errors, a nice interface (OSF's Motif), and support for C (withfunction calls) as well as LISP.andM;The start-up has a few beta customers, and hopes to ship the commercialversion next April.andP;  &quot;We'll push the flexibility it gets from being in LISP,&quot;especially dynamic schema modification, and will sell mostly to CAD/CAMcustomers, says Barry.andP;  The other focus for Barry and his two co-founders,also from Control Data, will be to generate powerful class libraries and towork with VARs, so that users needn't see the LISP.andP;  In addition, Orion IIwill support all the requisite features: multiple inheritance, fullydistributed operation on anything that runs Franz LISP, public and privatedatabases (a useful feature in distributed systems, so that you can keep yourown data undistributed), versions and so forth.andP;  Unlike the othernotyet-shipping vendors, Barry is willing to discuss pricing, which startsbefore discounts at $4000 per server, plus a $3000 LISP license from Franz.andM;MCC/Orion -- LISP is the good news and the bad news (research)andM;A research prototype, Orion first appeared (available to MCC shareholdersonly) in May of 1987, as a single-user system that nonetheless already hadtransaction management.andP;  A year later it graduated to a client/serverarchitecture (one server/many clients).andP;  This fall, as Orion-2, it shouldwork fully distributed, so that multiple users can make queries ortransactions with objects (including voice and images) on multiple platforms.andO;The system runs on either Suns or Symbolics machines, but servers can't bemixed to support a single database.andP;  Initial release of this version was July1, but the final transfer to sponsors will come this fall.andM;It will also include multiple inheritance, collections, support for bothprivate and shared databases, pessimistic concurrency with optimisticoptional, and dynamic schema modification; the only lack is support fornested transactions.andP;  However, Orion has only a programmatic interface (nonifty graphical browsers, for example).andP;  The first version did, but it wasbased on Flavors and wasn't reimplemented when the project switched to CommonLISP, says project manager Won Kim.andP;  The interface is not especiallyinteresting in terms of research, and is being left as an exercise forcommercial resellers such as Artemis, above.andM;Instead, Kim's next goal is to add reasoning into Orion, borrowing tools fromMCC's AI Lab projects such as CYC (see Release 1.0, March 86-3) and Proteus,an expert system shell.andP;  This new project should take four years, startingthis winter and building on an existing loose interface between Proteus andOrion.andM;Another group is working on Orion as a front-end to a variety of databases,both supporting objects all the way down and providing transparent access todata held in relational databases, among others.andP;  The advantage of this wouldbe to provide retrofit technology (see Release 1.0, 86-5) around existingdatabases and the data they already hold, and allow the data to bemanipulated with jazzy new object-oriented tools.andP;  Theoretically, flexible,LISP-based Orion will be able to accommodate any existing data structure as asubset.andP;  Of course, there will be no way to avoid some overhead, but theability to translate from one semantic model to another would be desirable.andO;We expect it can be achieved to some degree, but something always gets lostin translation (cf.andP;  French poetry in German, or Japanese haiku in English).andM;Versions of Orion are currently in productive use at several MCCshareholders.andP;  Bellcore is using it to manage an interactivedocument-generation tool called Quilt, and Control Data is using it formechanical CAD and for its &quot;General Data Library.&quot; Kodak is using Orionmostly to explore objectoriented databases and as &quot;a feature-set [for others)to beat,&quot; says Fred Mellender of Kodak's Advanced Computing Research Lab.andO;&quot;MCC has given us a lot of value,&quot; he adds.andP;  &quot;Commercial companies are takingless risk in this market because they can improve on the published work doneat MCC.&quot; But Kodak is also using Orion in real-live work, as a back-end toMCC's Proteus expert system, in a system that configures optical diskinformation systems for customers.andP;  &quot;Scores of installations&quot; have beenconfigured this way in the past year and a half, says Hellender.andP;  Otherpossible applications include a repository for software development (cf.andO;IBM's Repository, page 25).andM;Hevlett-Packard/IRIS -- Not inherited from NewWave (1990)andM;Iris is a longstanding research effort at Hewlett-Packard which has just nowmoved (partially) into a commercial division of the company, the Data andLanguages division.andP;  Although it has most of the standard features, Irisseems to have been influenced by the need to support other Hewlett-Packardproducts, specifically NewWave on the one hand and H-P's DBCore, the storagesubstrate that underlies H-P's relational databases, Image and Allbase.andP;  Thisrelational underpinning is the big flaw in Iris, because it doesn't providethe clustering and optimization needed for high performance.andP;  For now, it isstill a research prototype, more suitable for managing office automationobjects and exploring object-oriented architectures, than anindustrial-strength system that could manage the kinds of data encountered inH-P's scientific/engineering businesses.andP;  However, it does store object IDs,eliminating some of the joins and value-matching required to constructobjects out of a vanilla relational database.andP;  Further development on Iris isproceeding in two directions: one for support of H-P's traditionalengineering customers, competing with the other companies discussed here, andone for support of NewWave, where it's more likely to meet competition fromOracle and, in combination with OfficeVision, from IBM.andM;With integrating tweaks, Iris will provide persistent storage for Newwave'sObject Management Facility (see Release 1.0, 87-12).andP;  Basically, OMFmaintains data on all DOS files and links between data and the appropriateapplications, and is stored as a file that is loaded and maintained in memoryand virtual memory.andP;  (Least-recently used data is kept on disk.) As NewWaveusers create, say, compound documents that consist of multiple kinds of data,the volume of DOS files that the system has to manage (and that the usernever sees) can grow dramatically, necessitating some such system.andP;  Later on,when NewWave incorporates agents and a more deeply object-orientedarchitecture with fine-grained objects (instead of data file + application =object), the need for a robust object management system will increase.andM;For the engineering market, says development manager Bob Perreault, H-P iscollecting feedback from early-exposure customers to determine how tostrengthen Iris for production use.andP;  Specifically, the company plans to addclustering and other optimization techniques, either to DBCore or to a newstorage manager, to enhance performance to a competitive level.andP;  But it alsowants to find out which elements of the OODB feature set are most important.andO;Because Iris has not yet been formally announced, there are no dates and nofeature specifics, but we'd expect to see it out in some form in 1990.andM;Juniper Software/Persist -- One step at a time (1989 - Mac; 1990 - Sun)andM;Ontologic has already spawned two companies: Object Design (below) andJuniper Software, which will demonstrate its (initially) Mac-based,singleuser system at OOPSIA.andP;  A multi-user Sun version is to follow.andM;The project was begun last November by Craig Damon right after he was laidoff from Ontologic, where he had implemented Vbase along with Gordon Landis,now at Object Design.andP;  Damon was a co-founder of Ontologic and had been withits predecessor Mosaic almost from the beginning.andM;The two companies have similar long-term technical goals, although ObjectDesign is more ambitious in its hopes to set a standard.andP;  Says Damon,&quot;They'll have a fuller product, but we're closer to delivery.&quot; He's gottenthis far with only his own work and half a dozen part-time technical people,most of them still employed elsewhere until he can get funding on thestrength of the Mac version, which is basically a proof of concept that willsell for $1500.andP;  (&quot;It's an extreme disadvantage to be on the Mac,&quot; Damonsays, because most of the potential customers have Suns.andP;  But in the long runit may be a good way to find the next group of potential users and trade themup.andP;  They're the same kind of people who first used pcs, and ended upbuilding mission-critical systems.)andM;Unlike the other vendors, Juniper is starting out with a low-end versiontargeted at exploratory users.andP;  It runs underneath MPW (MacintoshProgrammer's Workbench) and looks deceptively simple with its user-friendlyinterface and a graphical browser, Underneath there's an industrial-strengthsystem struggling to get out.andP;  Persist already has user-specified clusteringand other optimization techniques, schema modification, support for complexobjects, and hooks for the addition of distributed objects and optimisticobject-level concurrency control.andP;  Objects are made persistent by an argumentto the constructor when an instance is created -- i.e., by an extension towhatever language is being used -- although a schema designer can alsodeclare a class persistent by default.andP;  Thus there is no need for applicationdevelopers to be aware of persistence, although they can manipulate itspecifically if they wish to.andM;Future Sun-based versions will support multiple users, multiple inheritance,pessimistic concurrency, nested transactions and other niceties, The Sunversion will go for $5000, Damon says.andM;Object Design/ObjectStore -- Running but not yet released (1990)andM;While people at the other Object...andP;  companies bring database or engineeringbackgrounds, Object Design's people come from the first-generationobjectoriented database world: chief architect Dan Weinreb was the principalarchitect of Statice, and ceo Tom Atwood and chief designer Gordon Landiswere major architects of Vbase.andP;  Data-model designer Jack Orenstein worked onCCA's Probe research project.andP;  Other employees came from the object-orientedprogramming world.andM;Their product ObjectStore will be on view in a private suite at OOPSIA.andP;  itwill be operating, if not fully debugged, with queries and transactionsacross a network of Sun servers, a set of graphical tools and all the basics- -collections, multiple inheritance, schema designer, and graphical tools(already shown at SIGMOD).andP;  Corporate partners including Kodak will getproduction code to work with early next year, for feedback on features aswell as testing, with commercial sales to follow late in the year.andM;Like the relational database vendors of today, Object Design is spendingsignificant time and effort on its tools as a means of differentiation.andP;  Butfounder Tom Atwood's basic goal is to set the industry standard withObjectStore's data manipulation/definition language, a set of extensions to Cor C++ that are translated into C with a pre-processor.andP;  (A future versionwill translate into C++, but for now C gives greater portability because ofthe prevalence of C compilers.)andM;&quot;Our obligation is not to hide under the skirts of C++.andP;  We've defined a datamodel, objects and relationships, and we've defined a DDL/DML language with acompiler to back it up,&quot; Atwood asserts.andP;  &quot;The issue isn't extending C++;you've got to, one way or another, because C++ doesn't do the job.andP;  The issueis who is the standard? The languages may vary syntactically but willprobably be similar semantically, and we're prepared to change our syntax ifwe have to [in response to market sentiment in favor of another standard].&quot;andM;ObjectStore parameterizes the C++ &quot;new&quot; command (as is now allowed in C++Release 2.0) to create persistent types, independent of any particularclasses, so that persistence is orthogonal to type.andP;  From then on,persistence is invisible to users and most applications.andP;  The databasedesigner determines whether clustering should be by class or by compositeobject or by some other arbitrary criterion, and can change this laterwithout too much difficulty.andP;  Although not necessarily in the first release,says database architect Dan Weinreb (also designer of Statice before he leftSymbolics), Object Design will provide tools to generate performance metricsto guide schema designers in tuning systems by means of specified clusteringcharacteristics and indexes.andM;Concurrency is handled at the page level -- not ideal from the point of viewof tidiness, Weinreb acknowledges, but he predicts it will result in higherperformance: Page-level locking limits overhead, and the cases when a lockedpage containing several objects would unnecessarily lock out a second usergoing after a different object are rare.andM;Object Design's corporate partners include Eastman Kodak's Boston TechnologyCenter (as opposed to the Rochester lab where Mellender works).andP;  Assistantmanager Bob Gordon is assessing ObjectStore as a potential back-end forhigh-end publishing applications.andP;  That would allow users to store text andimages and formats and enable, say, the automatic use of a color photocorrectly in both full-color and monochrome publications.andP;  In addition,Gordon points out, it would support legal and financial attributes, for taskssuch as copyright credit and cost accounting.andP;  Overall, he notes, &quot;ObjectDesign is doing a good job of attention to the complex trade-offs betweenfunctionality and performance.andP;  Features aside, the issue is scalability.andO;We're pretty glib about these things, but you're not going to see dBASErunning American Airlines' Sabra system anytime soon.&quot; Within a year, hesays, Kodak will have several more products in hand and will do a &quot;re-audit&quot;of all of them.andP;  Kodak and other corporate partners will get working betasystems this winter.andM;Objectivity/Objectivity/DB -- By engineers for engineers (1990)andM;Objectivity's Objectivity/DB remains the system most shrouded in mystery.andO;The company consists of a team mostly out of the engineering world, plus areal-live manager in the person of businessman and venture capitalist BobField.andP;  &quot;We like them because they're not object fanatics,&quot; says onepotential customer.andM;&quot;Calling us an object-oriented database company is like describing GM as asteel-and-vinyl company,&quot; says Field.andP;  For example, he adds, revealing oneproduct feature, &quot;Versioning is considered optional in an object-orienteddatabase, but it's absolutely vital to an engineering environment.andP;  We'reblending three technologies: object-oriented things, traditional databaseconcerns -- currency, privacy, heterogeneity -- and a bag of tricks fromengineering databases.andP;  People who do just two of those won't get the jobdone.andP;  Our tricks aren't Codd's twelve rules; they're not codified orpatented.andP;  They tend to be speed-related...&quot; All this will be implemented bystaff with experience at Daisy, Cadence, Applicon, Prime and ATP.andP;  The firstplatforms will be Sun-3s and DEC MIPS boxes.andM;Objectivity's emphasis is at the back-end, which is what its CAD-orientedcustomers want, but it has just hired a user-interface expert (Phil Gust, whoworked on the X Toolkit and user interfaces for groupware at H-P Labs) tobuild some end-user tools for the first release.andP;  (The timing of that isundisclosed, but figure at least a few months for the work to be done.) Agreat believer in standards, Objectivity has just joined the Open SoftwareFoundation, as well as the Workshop on Object-Oriented Design.andP;  However,Field doesn't promise to use OSF Motif because he isn't sure it will be astandard in the engineering world.andP;  Objectivity's technical advisory boardincludes Mark Linton, author of Interviews, a public-domain C++-basedalternative to Motif.andP;  In the end, says Field, &quot;Our task is to manage thedata, not to make it look good.&quot;andM;Object-Sciences/Object-* -- Database influence (1990)andM;Unlike Objectivity down the road in Menlo Park, Object-Sciences has drawnmost of its people from the database world -- Informix, as well as RTI andOracle, H-P and MCC's Orion project.andP;  Co-founder Mike Seashols, formerly vpof sales and marketing both at Relational Technology (85-88) and at Oracle(82-85), has signed on as full-time ceo.andP;  He had worked with founder Kee Ong,who was responsible for the overall architecture of RTI's Ingres and beforethat for H-P's Image database.andM;&quot;Oracle didn't invent anything new,&quot; asserts Ong.andP;  &quot;It just took [IBM's]System R and implemented it.&quot; In the same way, he's not looking to make anybreakthroughs, but rather to deliver a working, high-performance system basedon the best of existing database and object-oriented systems research.andP;  (Thestaff includes not only a host of database types, but also Hong-Tai Chou, whowrote much of the Wisconsin Storage System, or WiSS, under the guidance ofDave DeWitt, and also worked on Orion at MCC.) But, notes Ong, based on hisexperience at earnest, high-tech RTI, overshadowed by highpoweredmarketing-oriented Oracle, &quot;there's also sheer marketing.&quot; Finally, there's acache of $3.5 million raised from TA Associates and other sources.andM;The planned ship date is &quot;early 1990&quot;; if Object-Sciences beats Object Designit gets to keep the name of Object-Store for its storage component, saysSeashols.andP;  (We wouldn't be surprised to see thewhole product line calledObject-Star, in keeping with relational tradition dating back to IBM's R*,the prototype/predecessor to DB2.) Object-Sciences will focus on ahigh-performance portable engine, leaving front-ends and configurationdetails to OEMs and VARs.andP;  The system is designed to work in almost anyenvironment, with resellers adding to the hooks Object-Sciences will provide.andO;This is the initial strategy taken by most of the relational databasecompanies, although they are now turning to tools and applications as themarket becomes more cutthroat and their products become commodities.andM;The product is written in C and C++ and comes in five modules: Object-Base,the database model, and Object-Store, a storage system based on the ideas inWiSS; plus a C++ pre-processor and database schema generator; a.C++interface; and Object-Navigator, a browsing tool.andP;  Object-Base usesObject-Store as its storage system by default, but it can also load instancedata from an SQL database, providing easy integration with some existingdata.andP;  You can also use Object-Store alone as the back-end to a singleapplication that has large amounts of complex data but doesn't need theconcurrency, transaction management and manipulation capabilities of adatabase.andP;  Object-Navigator is a graphical front-end with a browser thatenables users to navigate through a network of objects and visualize a schemafor design, debugging or demonstration.andP;  In short, it uses an extended C++that can build a database directly from C++ source code.andP;  Concurrency worksat the object level, but objects must be explicitly checked in and out,rather than used seamlessly.andM;The first version will run on Suns, with other UNIX workstations to follow,as well as VAXen with Ultrix and VMS, and eventually OS/2.andP;  Object-Baseallows multiple inheritance, nested, distributed transactions and queries,collections, versions, and public and private databases.andM;Ontologic/Ontos -- Second time around (1988/89)andM;Ontologic is by far the oldest pure play in the object-oriented databasebusiness.andP;  It began life in 1982 as a hardware company (see Release 1.0,878), Mosaic Technologies, and floundered.andP;  In 1985 it decided to focus onits object-oriented database project, headed by Tom Atwood.andP;  (Atwood left in1987 and founded Object Design, above, early in 1988.) Ontologic firstshipped Vbase in 1988, but it never quite hit the mark.andP;  Problems includedthe product's nonstandard languages, Type Definition Language and C ObjectProcessor, a single-user-only implementation, and a lack of tools aggravatedby the nonstandard language which meant Ontologic had to do everythingitself.andP;  &quot;Ontologic felt they got bitten by making changes to a standardlanguage,&quot; says one customer.andM;Now the company has regrouped and is about to launch a C++-based rewrite ofthe product, called Ontos.andP;  Although outsiders have been skeptical of thecompany's chances, it has gained substantial credibility (and additionalfunding of $1 million from Kleiner Perkins and The Phoenix Partners) based ona contract from Index Technology, which is building a 1991 version of itsExcelerator CASE tool suite around Ontos, &quot;We were all dressed up with no oneto go to the party with&quot; except Ontologic, says Jerry Katzky, vp softwaredevelopment at Index.andP;  That mutual dependence virtually ensures Ontologic'snear-term survival, although an important part of Index's decision was basedon the availability of a C++ version and the portability it promises inextremis.andP;  With a shrunken staff of 20 (from 43) and revenues of about $2million in 1989, about half from Index and half from 25 other customers,Ontologic is now stabilized and plans to ship the first release of Ontos inSeptember.andM;Index has two beta versions of Ontos in-house -- one for UNIX on Suns, andone for OS/2.andP;  The company is pretty happy with the product -- and knows thatOntologic will listen hard to its suggestions.andP;  Index makes a point ofExcelerator's openness, allowing other vendors to hook into its tools anddata dictionary.andP;  With Ontos underneath, most of them will still want to gothrough the Excelerator interface, with Ontos invisible underneath.andP;  They cancreate objects with the Index tools, but they won't ever have to know howthey're stored.andM;Other customers will get Ontos for Suns and Apollos in October, and for OS/2in December.andP;  About 25 Vbase customers who were paying maintenance will getit free; 15 new customers will pay $15,000 each.andP;  Aside from its C++ support,Ontos will support multiple users and will even run on multiple, buthomogeneous, servers.andP;  It supports collections and pessimistic or optimisticconcurrency control, and version management.andP;  A graphical browser will bepart of the February release.andP;  A Mac client for Sun or Apollo servers will beavailable in December.andM;Servio Logic/GemStone -- Persistent company (1988)andM;GemStone is one of the few systems actively on the market, and has evolvedconsiderably on its path to its current version, Release 1.5.andP;  First soldcommercially in early 1988, the system should generate five times therevenues this year as last year, although both figures are undisclosed, thecompany says.andP;  The number of units isn't up as much, since customers are nowbuying higher-end systems (and five or six customers have even bought two ormore).andP;  Units are never comparable, but we figure that Servio Logic is atleast a leader in systems sold, with between 50 and 70, to Symbolics' 60 andOntologic's 40.andM;However, none of the customers is yet deploying the system to do productionwork, admits Servio Logic data systems general manager Mike Connell.andP;  Theyare still working on research or development, even one unidentified companythat has bought five copies for four different projects.andP;  As noted, Connellhas seen a shift from internal CASE efforts at telecommunications andindustrial customers to government and aerospace companies this year -- ashift he attributes in part to traditional dbms vendors who now promiseobjects too.andP;  The government and aerospace customers know precisely what theyneed, which is not tables of objects and links, and they need it now, not ina couple of years.andP;  Customers include NOAA (the National Oceanic andAtmospheric Administration), which will use it to manipulate maps, satellitescans and other information, and the Air Force's Advanced Launch Systemgroup.andM;Performance has improved by a factor of 8 to 10 since initial launch inRelease 1.5, and the range of platforms has broadened to include Suns, RTsand VAXen (Ultrix and VMS, DECstation coming).andP;  Clients include all of theabove; and front-ends run on PCs and Macs.andP;  GemStone uses a different modelfrom the traditional client-server architecture, offering distributedprocessing at user workstations, although the data must sit on a singleserver.andP;  Instead of potentially creating a processing bottleneck on theserver, each local unit (Gem) directly reads the central database (Stone) fordata which it then manipulates locally.andP;  This has the potential for creatingdata transfer bottlenecks, but Servio's tests have shown that this approachgenerally produces better performance than central processing, although notas good as fully distributed data and processing (which is much harder toaccomplish).andP;  Stone manages locks and allocates object IDs, but the Gems dothe rest of the work.andP;  This is akin to a relational database architecturewhere databases might download two or more tables and then do a join or someother query locally.andM;The biggest knock against GemStone has been its proprietary DML/DDL, Opal,and its Smalltalk flavor.andP;  There is a remote procedure call interface from Cand C++ (or any other language that can make a foreign C function call), butthe company is working on tighter integration by the first quarter of 1990,so that you can define your objects in C++ and the tool will automaticallyinstantiate them in GemStone.andP;  Servio also has hooks for access to SQLdatabases, and to Neuron Data's Nexpert Object.andM;As an indication of its flavor, GemStone's documentation uses pictures ofcompound documents where most of the other vendors would use exploded enginediagrams or VLSI layouts (Objectivity).andP;  Concurrency is optimistic bydefault; but a user can optionally lock any or all objects pessimistically(&quot;hybrid,&quot; if other objects in a single same transaction are left unlocked).andO;This operates either at the object level or at a collection of objectspredefined in the database or by an application.andP;  Prices range from $12,000to $92,000.andM;Symbolies/Statice -- The power of LISP (1988)andM;Statice was one of the first object-oriented databases to be commerciallyavailable, since last year - -but not very...andP;  For practical purposes, itsmarket was limited to Symbolics users, and most of the development team leftduring Symbolics' period of perestroika.andP;  Symbolics management had morepressing matters than Statice, so they kept the product on the market withouta great deal of resources behind it.andP;  Regardless, more than 40 customers havebought some 60 units and have liked it enough to make enhancement suggestions(version management, multiple servers) that Symbolics is working toimplement.andP;  Now that Symbolics is profitable again, it has decided to sink alittle more investment into Statice, an appealing entrant in a hot market,and will appoint a product manager.andM;The product is LISP-based and limited to a single server, but it is theepitome of object-oriented flavor, with support for collections, multipleinheritance, dynamic schema modification, default optimistic concurrencycontrol at the page level, with pessimistic optional.andP;  &quot;We recommend to ourusers to keep transactions short,&quot; acknowledges Symbolics technicalconsultant Neal Feinberg.andP;  Statice costs $10,000 per seat or $50,000 persite.andP;  It integrates extremely well with the rest of Symbolics' Generadevelopment environment -- but not so well with the rest of the world, C++ inparticular.andP;  However, the world of Symbolics itself is growing apace, asSymbolics concentrates on selling add-in Ivory boards (for Macs, Suns etc.)andO;and less on whole systems.andP;  In the long run Symbolics will probably shift itsemphasis to software and port its products to standard environments.andP;  At thatpoint, says vp technology Howie Shrobe, it might well be a fundamental partof Symbolics' strategy.andM;Customers include Alcoa, which is just starting to use Statice in adocumentation system called EGADS (Electronic Guidance And DocumentationSystem) .andP;  It manages information about the equipment and processes in acoldsteel rolling mill: When an alarm is triggered, it helps the user at aMac figure out what went wrong.andP;  Ultimately, says project manager KatherineHerring, the company hopes to hook it up to an expert system for diagnostics.andO;The benefit, of course, is that Statice can serve as a back-end to a varietyandM;of applications.andP;  That same benefit is also key in the Houston Power andamp; Lightimplementation, described above on page 4.andM;MCC: Research a la carte Even non-profit ventures can be disappointing totheir backers.andP;  MCC, created to foster US competitiveness against the foreignhordes, has turned out more like a slow-starting venture deal, with severalmanagement changes and shifts of direction and other digressions.andP;  But it hasdone some respectable Randamp;D that hasn't made its way out into productive,commercial use.andP;  Not all of MCC's backers are capable of using its technology(for reasons of culture, finance and focus, among others), and the unit hasfailed to develop the broad base of support it hoped for.andP;  (For historicalreasons, MCC stands for Microelectronics and Computer TechnologyCorporation.)andM;But under new CEO Grant Dove, and with new inside and outside marketeers inplace, this earliest of the current generation of consortia is about to gosemi-commercial, and open the fruits of its work to anyone with the means andthe incentive to spread it around.andP;  The organization is &quot;unbundling&quot; andoffering its technology to outsiders on a sort of second-option basis onceinvestors have had a crack at it on more favorable terms.andP;  Where investorsonce had to fund an entire division to the tune of several million dollars ayear, they can now invest in individual projects.andM;This pilot program applies initially only to the Advanced ComputingTechnology Program (formerly Advanced Computer Architecture).andP;  The projectsinclude those of the Object-Oriented and Distributed Systems Laboratory:Orion, and three follow-ons that will use Orion as a base: OBCD,object-oriented programming technology for concurrent systems; IOOS, Orionplus frame-based reasoning; and SHDB, Orion extended for heterogeneousoperation and transparent access to foreign databases.andM;ACT Lab participants include Bellcore, Control Data, Digital Equipment,Kodak, Harris, NCR.andP;  DARPA, E-Systems, General Dynamics, Honeywell andMotorola have come in under the new structure, although none has opted forthe object-oriented and distributed systems projects.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
