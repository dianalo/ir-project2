Vons, a large, closely held supermarket company, said the surviving company will assume the name Vons Cos., and will be traded on the New York Stock Exchange. It said the merged company will continue to operate all the pre-merger businesses of Vons.    The merger effectively allows Vons to go public without offering shares, and lets Allied go private without having to make an offer to acquire shares from shareholders.    Under terms of the merger, Vons stockholders received $132.1 million and 13.1 million Allied common shares, and Allied stockholders retained about 51.5% of the surviving company. As part of the transaction, Allied recently completed a public offering of senior subordinated debentures and subordinated debentures totaling $245 million.    Vons said Detroit-based Allied sold its Michigan operations to Meadowdale Foods Inc., a new company organized by Allied's former chairman, David K. Page, and former president, Lon D. Makanoff. The sale was for about $40 million, plus a $6 million subordinated debenture of the merged companies and the assumption of about $53 million of Allied's liabilities.    As previously reported, Vons and Allied initially announced a merger agreement last September but canceled it the following month when executives of the two companies said they couldn't agree on a number of issues. Messrs. Page and Makanoff, who took the Allied operations private, were to have been executives of the merged company under the initial plan. The first pact didn't call for Allied to sell its assets. The companies announced the latest agreement in January.    Vons itself was taken private in a leveraged buyout in January 1986. The buyout group included the Bass Investment Limited Partnership, which is an investment vehicle of the Bass brothers of Fort Worth, Texas. In a leveraged buyout, a group of investors acquires a company in a transaction financed largely by debt. The debt ultimately is paid through the acquired company's operations or a sale of its assets. </TEXT></DOC>
