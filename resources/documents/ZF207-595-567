Atech Software'sPublisher's Powerpak gives you scalable fonts in Ventura Publisher for$199.95 or in PFS: First Publisher for $79.95.andM;The quality of Atech Software's fonts won't exactly make PostScript'stypographers turn green with envy.andP;  But Publisher's Powerpak bringsreasonably good-looking scalable type to any of 250 dot matrix, ink-jet, andlaser printers, from the humble Epson FX-80 to the HP LaserJets and the NECSilentwriter.andP;  If your printer isn't supported, it probably doesn't reallyexist.andM;The Ventura version generates fonts in sizes from 6 to 250 points; the FirstPublisher version stops at 72 points.andP;  The fonts look their best when youprint in sizes of 20 points and larger.andP;  Anything smaller is acceptable ifyou don't mind rough-hewn type with uneven spacing between characters.andM;The package comes with versions of Times Roman, Helvetica, and Courier in theVentura character set.andP;  Instead of true italics and bold, you'll have to livewith sloped and darkened versions of the normal fonts.andP;  But a font managerthat comes with the disk lets you produce narrow, wide, hollow, and othervariations of type and create screen fonts to match.andM;Three add-on font packages ($49.95 for Ventura, $29.95 for First Publisher)contain two typefaces each; a fourth package has symbols, dingbats, and ascript font.andM;Publisher's Powerpak installs easily and automatically and doesn't get in theway of any normal Ventura functions.andP;  It generates its fonts in yourcomputer's memory faster than most PostScript printers can in their ownmemory.andP;  Even if you use an HP LaserJet, the package may be worth buying foroccational use with extra-large fonts.andP;  With many dot-matrix printers,Publisher's Powerpak adds capabilities you won't find anywhere else.andM;Atech has just begun shipping a $139.95 version of its package forMicrosoftWord and WordPerfect.andP;  This latest release of Publisher's Powerpakwill add new capabilities for dot matrix printers, though anyone using alaser printer with those two programs will get much better scalable fontsfrom SWFTE InternationaL's Glyphix.andM;List Price: Publisher's Powerpak: $199.95 (for Ventura Publisher), $79.95(for PFS: First Publisher).andM;Requires: 512K RAM, hard disk, supported printer, DOS 2.0 or later.andM;Not copy protected.andP;  Atech Software, 629 S.
