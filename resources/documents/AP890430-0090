One of the men who fell from the 2,145-ton Barbel was rescuedlater, the U.S. Forces Media Liaison Office said in a statement.   It said the rescued man was picked up by the submarine itselfafter a search aircraft spotted him. His identity and conditionwere withheld.   The submarine was conducting surface operations in internationalwaters when a wave swept away the crewmen, who were standing watchon deck, the statment said.   Kiyoshi Harada, spokesman for Japan's Maritime Safety Agency,said the accident occurred about 31 miles southwest of Noma Cape inKagoshima Prefecture, or state.   Harada said three Japanese aircraft and four vessels, includingthree Japanese patrol boats, were searching for the two missing men.   A Japanese defense official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said that before the accident, the submarine surfacedbecause it was taking on water from a hatch. He refused toelaborate.   However, Lt. Jeff Gradeck, a Navy spokesman based in Yokosuka,denied that report. ``We have no information that there is anythingwrong with the Barbel, and it is taking part in the search,'' hesaid.   In Washington, Defense Department spokesman Maj. John Smith saidhe had heard reports of the missing men but he had no furtherdetails.   There were no reports of injuries of any other crewmen.   The Barbel, built in 1956 and equipped with 6 torpedo tubes, hasa crew of 77, according to U.S. military officials.   The 219-foot-long, diesel-electric powered Barbel belongs to thelast non-nuclear combat submarine class built by the Navy.</TEXT></DOC>
