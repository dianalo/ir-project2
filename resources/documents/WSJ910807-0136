By late afternoon, when the children's sports and socialactivities are finished, the Yocums will have watched fouryouth sporting events and participated in two others, once ascoach and once as umpire, squeezing in a picnic somewhere inbetween.   &quot;By the time 5 o'clock rolls around, I'm dead,&quot; says Mr.Yocum, whose weekend schedule couldn't be kept without helpfrom at least one grandparent. &quot;It's a test of yourendurance.&quot;   Parenting nowadays has become as frenzied a job as manymanagement positions. The number of activities available tochildren has exploded, and today's fast-track parents don'tseem to be able to just say &quot;no.&quot; They're pushing childrensooner and more often into activities they believe willenhance their kids' chances to land at the best schools and,later, the best jobs.   In helping children try to achieve their full potential,&quot;it's de rigueur for the parents to be fully involved,&quot; saysDaniel Stamp, president of Priority Management, a consultingfirm in Vancouver, British Columbia, that specializes in timeusage and productivity. Baby boomer parents don't just signtheir children up for Scouts or craft and music lessons --many go along and participate.   But at what cost? &quot;Everybody's in such a hurry, and adultsend up transferring the anxiety they feel to their children,&quot;says T. Berry Brazelton, a professor of child development atHarvard University. &quot;There's not much chance to be a childanymore.&quot;   Overscheduling takes its toll on the parents, too. Insteadof relaxing at home in their spare time and unwinding from abusy work week, they shuttle from one activity to the next.What gets left out is any time for themselves, or time athome with spouses, family or friends. Sometimes resentmentover the breakneck pace builds.   David Gutterman, a clinical psychologist in Evanston,Ill., says the new fathers he counsels face more stress thanever, largely because of the issue of time management.&quot;Society expects that fathers be more involved,&quot; he says.&quot;There's a lot of anxiety associated with fatherhood now.There are so many balls to juggle.&quot;   Increasingly, the responsibilities of parenting intrudeinto the working day, heightening the stress many feel.Sometimes tough decisions must be made: choosing, say,between attending an important management meeting and achild's school play.   &quot;For the first time in all the years I've worked, I don'thave enough time in my day,&quot; says Ilana Knapp, an executiveat a New Jersey securities firm. She says her children, agesseven and 12, seem to require more time from her now thanwhen they were younger. For years, the 12-year-old has calledher at work every afternoon to chat. Now she also calls atnoon. Though her bosses never object, Mrs. Knapp says:&quot;Things can get pretty crazy around here. I try not to rushher, but there are times I feel rushed.&quot;   Parents say they've had to make big adjustments --including cutting back on their sleep -- to keep pace.Television watching, socializing with friends and householdchores are most often cited as the activities that have beencurtailed.   Mary Anne Jarvik, a business manager in Pittsburgh, andher husband, Jonathan, a biology professor at Carnegie MellonUniversity, have tried to limit their three sons' schedule oforganized activities. Friday night, for instance, is alwaysset aside for the family to watch a movie together or playboard games.   Yet despite the discipline the Jarviks have tried toimpose, &quot;you can't help but get involved in too many things,&quot;Mrs. Jarvik says. &quot;It just happens.&quot; The Jarvik children,ages eight, seven and four, play soccer and baseball and takeswimming and piano lessons. In addition, &quot;if they're nothaving a birthday party, they're going to one,&quot; Mrs. Jarviksays.   &quot;Some of it's fun,&quot; she adds. &quot;But we don't seem to savoranything. Frenetic is the only word I can think of todescribe our pace. Everything rushes by so fast, and thenit's on to the next activity. I feel like I careen from onething to another.&quot;   Mrs. Jarvik says she has considered quitting her job tostay home with the children, thinking that might alleviatethe time stress she feels. Meantime, her &quot;mental peace ofmind&quot; suffers, she says. She fantasizes about a simpler life,usually living in a one-room cottage in Maine or France. Andwhen the children aren't in bed by 10 p.m., she gets&quot;resentful. I feel, `How dare you not go to sleep. This is mytime.'&quot; Her own bedtime usually isn't until after midnight.&quot;That's how long it takes us to pick up the pieces and try tokeep some order,&quot; she says.   Some parents have finally said &quot;enough.&quot; In some cases,the children themselves have initiated a more rational pace.That was the case for Karen Stump, a chemistry instructor atCarnegie Mellon in Pittsburgh and mother of three. She saysher schedule was once overwhelming -- until herseven-year-old daughter, Megan, objected to the pace. &quot;Shefinally said, `I want to spend some time at home,'&quot; Mrs.Stump recalls. &quot;Now we're better at limiting the number ofoutside activities the kids are involved in.&quot;   Working women with children are more than twice as likelyas men to feel constant stress, according to a survey thisyear by John P. Robinson, director of the University ofMaryland's Americans' Use of Time Project. More than 40% ofthe working women surveyed felt &quot;trapped&quot; by their dailyroutine, the study concluded. A 1989 study by CornellUniversity found the stress of balancing personal andprofessional lives so great that about two-thirds of motherswho worked full time would have cut their hours if theyhadn't needed the extra income.   Parenting claims huge chunks of time for moms who stay athome, too. In the summer months, for instance, Mrs. Yocum isliberated from the dual demands of mother and high schoolteacher. Yet she finds the time constraints even more acutein summer than during the school year, partly because thechildren's activities expand as she becomes more available.   &quot;There's days we start at 9 or 10 in the morning and wedon't finish until 9 or 10 in the evening,&quot; she says of hersummer schedule. &quot;Sometimes I don't know where one day beginsand the other ends.&quot;   Mr. Yocum says he has wondered lately if the pace issimply too much: &quot;I worry that the children are tooregimented and they don't get time to be kids.&quot; Mrs. Yocumshares her husband's concerns. She wants to write a book, shequips, titled, &quot;So You Think You Want To Be a Parent?&quot;   Some people have adopted complex working schedules tobalance the demands on their time. Consider Scott Harris, whofor the past six years has put in 80-hour work weeks buildinghis own advertising and marketing firm, Mustang Marketing, inWestlake, Calif., into a success. In the same period, he hasalso had two children.   Most mornings Mr. Harris is at his desk by 4 a.m. He putsin three hours of work, then returns home to have breakfastwith his wife and children. The schedule is repeated mostevenings: Once the children are in bed, he goes back to theoffice, usually until midnight. Mr. Harris says it wouldn'tbe possible except that he requires little sleep, typicallygetting three hours a night.   &quot;My kids didn't suffer at all&quot; from the work schedule, hesays proudly. &quot;I haven't missed a single athletic event orschool award.&quot;   But Mr. Harris admits he has made sacrifices besidessleep. Until recently, he hadn't taken a vacation in sixyears. And time alone with his wife is limited. &quot;There are alot of things I've given up,&quot; he says, &quot;but I had to set mypriorities. My children are real important to me.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
