Their conditions for ending a hunger strike by thousands ofstudents on Tiananmen Square center around demands for governmentrecognition of their new, independent student organizations.   As a first step, the students say, the government must engage ina televised dialogue with student representatives. Acknowledgementof the activist groups as the voice of the students must follow.   The government has talked to delegates from official studentunions, but has balked at recognizing the new student-electedgroups.   One major factor is government concern that independent studentgroups could be followed by workers breaking away from thestate-controlled trade unions and interest groups forming politicalparties opposing the ruling Communist Party.   Students also demand that the government apologize to the nationthrough the People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, for itscriticisms of the student movement. Students are particularlyincensed over an April 26 editorial that accused the students ofbeing agitators bent on causing social turmoil.   Communist Party chief Zhao Ziyang and other leaders now refer tothe students as ``patriotic'' and have met student demands thatthere be no violence or recriminations against them. But they havenot responded on the issue of a written apology.   The broader demands are less defined, but focus on officialcorruption, press freedom and the resignation of top leaders.   Students have demanded that senior officials disclose theirincomes as one step toward ending the corruption _ bribery,influence-peddling, profiteering in scarce goods and nepotism _that is rampant among officials and bureaucrats.   Student demands for press freedom have in part already broughtabout significant changes. The state-run press, pressured byjournalists supporting the students, has given extensive,sympathetic and factual coverage to the demonstrations. Before thecurrent protests, that would have been impossible.   The students continue to demand the rehabilitation of Qin Benli,editor of Shanghai's liberal World Economic Herald, who was removedfrom his job in the early days of the protest for attempting toprint articles critical of government leaders. Authorities havesince stopped publication of the weekly.   Although student leaders have not come out against thegovernment, many protest participants are carrying banners andsigns demanding the resignation of top officials.   A main target is 84-year-old Deng Xiaoping, the father ofChina's economic reforms, who students say is now too old tounderstand the rapid changes China is undergoing.   Students also are calling for Premier Li Peng to step down. Liis accused of incompetance and is generally associated with moreconservative factions who favor slowing economic and politicalreforms.   Students also have demanded more money for the nation'sunderfunded and inadequate educational facilities and bettertreatment for teachers, among the nation's poorest civil servants.</TEXT></DOC>
