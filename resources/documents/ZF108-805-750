House, director of the NSF'sDivision of Policy Research and analysis.andM;House said he wanted a system that could give NSF executives immediateinformation for responding to or resolving specific issues.andM;Besides user friendliness, he said, the PC platform offered the advantages ofdatabase portability, ease of access and low equipment costs.andM;The system's home-grown natural language interface, written using ArityProlog, gives analysts and executives immediate access to Caspar informationvia plain English queries.andM;Response time often is less than three minutes.andM;However, the system is more than an English interpreter.andP;  It performs severalsteps when responding to a question.andP;  In fact, &quot;the system replicates theactivities normally performed by a data analyst,&quot; House said.andM;Formulating a ResponseandM;In responding to a user query, he said, the NSF natural language system:andM;* Identifies the requested data elements and any other data needed to providea context for interpreting the requested data.andM;* Extracts the data from the Caspar database and puts it in a spreadsheetformat.andM;* Computes a forecast using the data queried and the selected contextualdata.andM;* Draws an annotated graph using the requested and contextual data, andincluding forecast data.andM;* Computes summary statistics of the graphed data.andM;* Composes a series of text bullets describing the graph.andM;* Formats the text bullets in a word processor for viewing and editing.andM;* Offers extensive help information on related available data, as well asalternative data cross-tabulations that may interest the executive.andM;Though the natural language interface steals the NSF system's show, theCaspar database has many innovations of its own.andP;  The compressed Caspardatabase takes up more than 90M of space and contains more than 1.2 billiondata cells, House said.andM;Caspar contains data that, over time, NSF analysts have found to be the mostoften requested by executives, House said.andP;  The information is drawn fromNSF's internal files on proposals and awards, as well as on more than 3,500academic organizations, academic fields of science, states and territories,federal funding agencies and regional groups.andM;NSF gathers the data from its own surveys as well as those conducted by theEducation Department, the National Research Council, the Census Bureau andother organizations.andM;NSF employees built the interface with products such as Microsoft Corp.'sExcel, Windows and Write; SQL Network from Gupta Technologies Inc. of MenloPark, Calif.; and the Prolog artificial intelligence language from ARityCorp. of Concord, Mass.andM;Using Lotus 1-2-3 Version 2.01 with some NSF tweaking, the Caspar systemoffers fast multidimensional output in spreadsheet format, specificallydesigned for data analysis.andM;This is possible because the Caspar-formatted data is preprocessedextensively, House said.andM;The NSF staff identified useful items in existing data sources andpre-indexed, sorted and aggregated them into a consistent and integratedform, or &quot;pre-digested&quot; them, House said.andM;NSF analysts use a set of Lotus 1-2-3 macros to rapidly produce statisticaland graphical output such as regressions, cross-tabulations, correlations,bar graphs and line graphs from spreadsheet files, said Bryan Thompson, thenatural language system's principal designer.andM;Following the RulesandM;&quot;The system builds a set of rules that discriminate among the questions aspre-processed by the grammar,&quot; Thompson said.andP;  &quot;Once the grammar hasprocessed a question it then looks at this rule base, which it builtinductively, and decides what is the most appropriate response from thedatabase.andM;&quot;That process itself takes a minute or two to run in advance of processingthe question.andP;  It takes less than a second to process a question.&quot;andM;House said NSF began putting its data together about five years ago, &quot;becausethe data was all over the place and the executives tended to want informationimmediately.&quot;andM;He said he looked at some of the natural language interfaces on the marketbut found them to be nothing more than &quot;repetitive query&quot; systems that &quot;noexecutive would put up with.&quot;andM;So he decided to build his own.andP;  He said his goal was &quot;a system where wecould just type a question in and get an answer.&quot;andM;The Caspar database system with the natural language interface runs on atleast a 286 machine, Thompson said.andM;He himself runs the system on a Compaq Computer Corp. Deskpro 386/25 machine,but Thompson also has used it on portable computers from Toshiba America Inc.andO;of Irvine, Calif., and NEC America Inc. of Melville, N.Y.andM;In addition, Thompson said the system has been tested and run on a Compaq LTE286 notebook computer with a 40M hard drive.andM;Though pre-digested for the PC, the source of the Caspar data is the NSF'sIBM Corp. 3090 mainframe computer.andP;  Quantum Research Corp. of Bethesda, Md.,andO;did much of the work in developing Caspar.andM;Thompson said he designed the interface so that Arity Prolog does all thelanguage analysis and C++ programming handles all the data analysis.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
