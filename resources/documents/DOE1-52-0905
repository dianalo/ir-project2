<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-52-0905 </DOCNO><TEXT>Geo-Log Inc. specializes in logging coal, uranium and petroleum drillholes. The GEO-LOG apparatus carries out gamma, neutron, acoustic andtelevision logging, coal logging, logging of resistance, diameters, temperaturesand potentials, and geophysical logging. Coal logging consists of gamma-focusedgamma density logging, diameter logging, resistance logging (6 inch longpotential probe). This logging allows quantitative parameters of coaldeposits to be determined. Television logging permits television picturesto be recorded and yields information on fissures, stratification andgeometry of deposits, inclinations and thickness of strata. Using geophysicallogging, the Poisson ratio, modulus of rigidity and cubic elasticity,cross-plot porosity, strength coefficient and clay content can be determined.5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
