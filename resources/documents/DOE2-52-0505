<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-52-0505 </DOCNO><TEXT>This invention discloses a new mineral fiber product, presenting at thesame time satisfactory mechanical properties as well as an exceptionaldimensional stability in various humidity and load conditions. Theseproperties permit the material to be used advantageously in diverse applicationssuch as structural surfaces in buildings and insulation. The product,according to the invention, is a composite sheet made of discontinuousmineral fibers held together by a polymer binder, having a fiber contentof over 70% of the total weight of the fibers plus binder, and a bulkdensity of 400-1500 kg/m/sup 3/. This composite sheet is formed startingfrom mineral fibers obtained by the classic processes of fabricatinginsulating felts or blankets, which are then strongly compressed to atemperature which assures polymerization of the binder. The materialof the invention is generally lighter than fiber-reinforced plastic materials,is moldable, has a substantial rigidity and good elasticity, and is readilyworkable. Additives can be used to vary the properties according to theapplication envisaged. 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
