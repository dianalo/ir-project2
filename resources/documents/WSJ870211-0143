Nothing unusual, except that two months ago these finny fellows were females.    The goldfish got their sex change here at Japan's National Research Institute of Aquaculture, 180 miles west of Tokyo. A dozen female rainbow trout in a large concrete trough outside also are unusual: There were no males among their thousands of siblings.    These freaks represent big hopes for Japan's fish industry. Their gender was determined by means of chromosome manipulation and hormone treatments -- techniques that theoretically could create marine creatures such as giant salmon, or tuna that swim to fisheries to be harvested. Scientists also want to create &quot;superfish&quot; that merge the strengths of many species.    &quot;Some of this may seem a bit dreamy -- a little science-fictionish,&quot; says Ryo Suzuki, manager of genetic and breeding research at the aquaculture institute. But &quot;there could be lots of payoffs if we apply the technologies to commercially important fish.&quot;    Japan's fishing industry sees a future in biotechnology. Backed by government funds, aquaculture labs around Japan are trying to bring mass production to fish breeding just as the nation did in industries from televisions to cars. In the new industry's parlance, fish become engineered &quot;products&quot; subject to &quot;quality control&quot; and &quot;productivity improvement.&quot; Government planners have organized a research-and-development machine to take ideas, generated largely in the West, from lab to fishery to fishmonger.    Biotechnology, they hope, will keep farms and coastal waters stocked with highly efficient species that can satisfy Japan's insatiable appetite for seafood. &quot;It's really a matter of survival,&quot; says Fumio Takashima, a professor at the Tokyo University of Fisheries. &quot;We need to make economically superior fish.&quot;    The all-female trout in the concrete tanks are prime examples. Using a technique called gynogenesis, researchers expose trout spermatozoa to ultraviolet light, denaturing the chromosomes. Eggs fertilized with the inactivated-chromosome sperm are briefly chilled to near freezing, causing the eggs to develop with only the mother's chromosomes. The result: all-female offspring. The technique could be commercially available in several years.    An all-female brood would be a gold mine for the fish farms on which Japan depends for 10% of its catch -- more than any other nation. Many female food fish grow bigger than males -- twice as big in the case of flounder -- and live longer. An all-female brood of sturgeon would bring fatter profits to caviar producers.    What's more, gynogenesis will help fisheries quickly create superior breeds. The process can approximate five generations of inbreeding, which itself magnifies genetic effects when it occurs in nature. Fish created by gynogenesis with &quot;bad&quot; genes are deformed and don't live long. Conversely, those with &quot;good&quot; genes grow larger and are less prone to disease. It takes only two years to produce a superior trout strain, as opposed to 30 years with conventional breeding methods.    Domesticating fish has taken on urgency here as other nations increasingly restrict Japanese fishing boats in their territorial waters; the Soviet Union and the U.S. in recent years have crimped Japanese fishing in their zones. Japan's distant-water fishing catch has fallen to about two million tons annually from a peak of 3.7 million in 1974, forcing the Japanese to depend even more heavily on fish farms and the waters around Japan.    The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry plunged into biotech fish in 1985 and spends $182,000 a year in grants and $175,000 in loans for fishery labs nationwide. &quot;We need new technology to improve the product,&quot; says Koichi Hisada, a ministry official. &quot;We're making the seeds for that new technology.&quot;    In addition to gynogenesis, those &quot;seeds&quot; include techniques to produce sterile fish and to change females to males. To hatch sterile fish, eggs are chilled just after fertilization, creating fish with three sets of chromosomes rather than the normal two-one set from the father and two from the mother. These fish, called triploids, never spawn and never stop maturing, thus growing bigger and not spending energy on egg production.    A prefectural lab in southern Japan, for example, is developing triploid &quot;ayu&quot;, a smelt-like river fish favored by sport anglers here. Natural ayu bite only in July and August while plying upstream to spawn. By September, they stop eating and begin spawning. Those caught before they die in November have lost their flavor.    The lab's biotech ayu don't spawn, so they don't stop biting. What's more, they grow bigger, live longer and don't lose their sheen. Other labs are applying the triploid process to salmon, which grow twice as big as normal.    The sex-changed male goldfish are an important key to biotech aquaculture. Formerly females produced by gynogenesis, they swam around in water laced with a male hormone for two months. The &quot;pseudo-male&quot; fish produce sperm that can create only female offspring.    Japan's biotech fish are kept out of open waters, lest newly created strains wreak havoc on delicate undersea environments. The Agriculture Ministry is compiling regulations and guidelines for raising the new fish in natural waters.    &quot;People worry that some bizarre man-made fish will take over the ocean,&quot; says the ministry's Mr. Hisada. While that isn't likely, he adds, &quot;we have to be very careful.&quot;    Fish researchers eventually want to use more exotic biotech methods, such as extracting a gene for a specific characteristic from one fish and building it into another. Scientists dream of creating a &quot;superfish&quot; by combining genes from, say, a disease-resistant fish, a large fish, fish strong in cold or in hot conditions and a fish that reproduces often.    An even bigger dream is to isolate the genes that cause salmon to return to their river birthplace to spawn after swimming the open seas for three years. Fish engineers then could transfer the gene into species of fish that normally don't have the salmon's homing instinct. After growing wild for several years, the new species would faithfully come home to the waiting fisheries.    &quot;It would save lots of money to have your tuna come back to you,&quot; says Mr. Hisada. &quot;But it's just a dream.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
