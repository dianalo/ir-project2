Several longtime bears on the stock have boosted earnings estimates and put out buy recommendations in the past several weeks. Last week, the stock reached a high of 31 3/4, compared with a 52-week low of 22 reached in February. It closed yesterday at 30 1/2, down 3/8.    The enthusiasm is partly speculative: Many analysts expect ATandamp;T will get favorable regulatory action on its long-distance business next year. But there may also be a more concrete reason for buying the stock. ATandamp;T says it finally has its costs under control in its loss-plagued business of selling phone and computer equipment to the public.    ATandamp;T doesn't break out segment results, but last year, analysts figured the business had roughly $1 billion in pre-tax operating losses -- give or take a few hundred million dollars. Just bringing that business, formerly called Information Systems, to the break-even level would add between 35 cents and 48 cents a share to ATandamp;T's earnings, some analysts estimate.    ATandamp;T earned $1.64 a share before a $1.7 billion restructuring charge last year, so stemming the losses from Information Systems would provide a marked boost to earnings.    &quot;The company is coming from lying flat on its back to standing up,&quot; Robert Morris III of Prudential-Bache Securities says. ATandamp;T shares could run up to 40 in the next 12 months, the formerly bearish Jack B. Grubman of PaineWebber says.    The cost reductions, ATandamp;T executives have said, stem not only from the thousands of jobs cut -- ATandamp;T has trimmed employment by 14,000 this year alone -- but from better management of inventory and factories.    Robert Kavner, its chief financial officer, has said ATandamp;T is keeping better track of equipment that moves in and out of warehouses. And the company finally put a process in place to more systematically challenge estimates of product sales by marketing managers. Excessively optimistic sales estimates have been blamed for factories being overbuilt in the past.    Despite all the optimism, though, a few ATandamp;T bears still exist. Daniel Zinsser of Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. recommends selling the stock and values it at just 24 or 25. He says ATandamp;T's long-distance business is earning less than its authorized rate of 12.2%. He also expects the company to lose market share as competitors enter markets, such as the toll-free &quot;800&quot; network and international service, where it used to have a monopoly.    Moreover, some analysts say there's no guarantee ATandamp;T will get the regulatory action it seeks, which would replace the current limit on the company's rate of return with a cap on prices.    &quot;There is sort of blind enthusiasm over this deregulation story,&quot; John Bain of Shearson Lehman Brothers says. &quot;Nobody has thought about what ATandamp;T will have to give up&quot; to get the rate-of-return cap removed. It might have to take another big rate cut, he says.    Without regulatory relief, ATandamp;T will be a table-pounding buy only if it can enliven its sluggish sales of computer and phone equipment, some analysts say.    &quot;I don't think it's a slam dunk&quot; that regulators will remove the cap on profit, Maria Sbrilli of Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co., says. She is neutral on the stock and doesn't value it at a premium to the market.    &quot;Should ATandamp;T find itself blocked on long distance,&quot; she asks, &quot;what alternative sources of growth are available?&quot;    Sales of personal computers, while a tiny part of ATandamp;T product sales, are down 50% to 60% this year, Ms. Sbrilli says. Overall product sales, including telecommunications equipment and cable, fell 7% in the first half after adjusting for last year's strike, ATandamp;T says.    But PaineWebber's Mr. Grubman, who less than six months ago called ATandamp;T's growth strategies &quot;pipe dreams,&quot; now values its shares at a premium to the market. He predicts ATandamp;T will continue to hold the line on costs and will get regulatory relief by the middle of next year.    Once that happens, Mr. Grubman says, ATandamp;T will cut costs in its long-distance business and continue to invest to maintain its position as the lowest-cost provider. Moreover, he says he senses a fundamental change in the industry. Long-distance unit growth is accelerating to double-digit rates, he says, as companies put more and more information over the wires.    &quot;It would be more exciting if ATandamp;T were cutting losses and revenue was growing,&quot; Mr. Grubman says. &quot;But when you are a $40 billion company (in revenue), growing earnings is two parts cost-cutting and one part revenue growth.&quot;    ---   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph    (NYSE; Symbol: T)   Business: Telecommunications   Year ended Dec. 31, 1986:   Revenue: $34.09 billion   Net Income: $129 million, or 5 cents a share*    Second quarter, June 30, 1987:    Per-share earnings: 55 cents vs. 37 cents    Average daily trading volume:   3,319,558 shares   Common shares outstanding: 1.07 billion    *Includes $1.7 billion restructuring charge </TEXT></DOC>
