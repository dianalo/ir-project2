The Ministry of International Trade and Industry, or MITI, has ordered an additional review of applications to export several categories of products, including computers, numerically controlled machine tools and semiconductor-manufacturing equipment. The reviews apparently are meant to weed out unreliable shippers and detect possible attempts to reroute the goods to countries to which such exports are banned.    MITI officials said the extra scrutiny applies only to products valued at more than 100 million yen ($700,000). However, less-costly products in these categories are still subject to routine export-licensing checks, the officials said.    &quot;The system isn't 100% perfect, but it's working reasonably well,&quot; a Foreign Ministry official told reporters. The official said the U.S. has been similarly reassured. Even so, the U.S. has indicated that it wants Japan to take better care of how Japanese technology is sold around the world.    U.S. officials expressed approval of MITI's latest action but said they are reserving judgment until they can see how effective it is.    The Reagan administration has been upset by the discovery that Toshiba Machine Co., a Toshiba Corp. unit, illegally shipped to the Soviet Union four computerized milling machines that apparently were used to build ultra-quiet submarine propellers.    Tokyo prosecutors yesterday indicted Toshiba Machine and two senior employees in connection with the illegal exports, the Kyodo news service reported. The company, 52-year-old Ryuzo Hayashi and 50-year-old Hiroaki Tanimura were charged with violation of foreign-exchange and foreign-trade-control laws.    Besides tightening its monitoring of strategic exports, the Foreign Ministry said Japan also is joining a U.S. initiative to persuade non-allied, but friendly, countries to help prevent the diversion of strategic goods to the Soviet bloc.    Japan also has taken precautions to prevent misuse of technology acquired from the U.S., a Pentagon aide said. &quot;We don't know of an example of U.S. technology that was sent to Japan and later compromised to the Soviets,&quot; he said.    Japan's extra vigilance, however, puts new strain on a small and overworked export-licensing bureaucracy. &quot;If this goes on, we might even have a health problem on our hands,&quot; said Hiroshi Fujiwara, deputy director of MITI's Office of Security Export Controls. Mr. Fujiwara's agency has only 20 employees to handle nearly 200,000 license applications a year, although another 100 bureaucrats in MITI regional offices help route the papers.    The system isn't computerized, as its U.S. equivalent is. &quot;We handle each application manually,&quot; Mr. Fujiwara said.    MITI officials said that a freeze on bureaucratic growth, which has been in effect throughout Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's tenure, restrains the agency from expanding export-monitoring personnel.    Even so, Japanese companies sometimes feel the system's bite. Recently, MITI used the threat of license denial to try to compel Japanese semiconductor producers to stop dumping their products in foreign markets at prices U.S. competitors regard as unfair. The White House says semiconductor makers are still dumping, but to a lesser degree.    MITI still doesn't have the manpower to assess the reliability of foreign buyers by itself. But Mr. Fujiwara said the agency, in some cases, will require an import certificate from the importing country's government before authorizing a shipment and later request official verification that the shipment had indeed been received by the designated buyer.    In addition, MITI is paying closer attention to the export of strategic goods to India, Pakistan and other countries that are suspected of secretly acquiring the capability to manufacture nuclear devices.    The agency said it will seek assurances that high-powered computers and other sophisticated products from Japan aren't used to improve those countries' bomb-making capabilities. India and Pakistan have denied that they are working on nuclear weapons; they acknowledge that they have conducted nuclear experiments, but for peaceful purposes only. </TEXT></DOC>
