They think it's been a tremendoussuccess.''   Ms. Saraniti said members of the industry see 1989 as ``a verygood year. The exhibitors are extremely optimistic.''   The health of the industry is a reflection on the economy ingeneral since most of those exhibiting their wares here depend onthe discretionary income of consumers.   Industry officials are predicting $31.645 billionin factory salesin consumer electronics goods in 1989, up 5 percent from 1988figures.   A record 1,430 exhibitors spent four days touting wares rangingfrom camcorders and computers to TVs, video games and adult flicks.   Attendance for the show is expected to range between 80,000 and90,000, Ms. Saraniti said. Final figures are due Wednesday.   Higher attendance figures have been announced in past years, butMs. Saraniti said this is the first year actual attendance has beenchecked against pre-registration.   Products at the 1989 show covered 776,000 square feet of displayspace _ an area the size of 19 football fields.   Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Association ofAmerica, told the convention Sunday that the VCR industry, onceviewed as a virus by the movie industry, now is seen as a tonic.   He called for ``cooperative collaboration'' between the movie andelectronics industry, and said the two should join in the fightagainst film pirating.   A major focus at this year's show was home automation, whichallows home electronics products and utilities to ``talk'' to eachother. The new system has been described as a ``communicationspathway throughout the home.''   One scenario for the new system would allow a homeowner to checkelectronically his or her home security system at night, lockingdoors, turning off lights, turning down the thermostat _ all fromcontrols in the bedroom.   ``We've developed a language which allows your appliances tospeak with and control one another,'' CES spokesman Tom Lauterbacksaid. ``Items such as cellular phones will allow you to start yourappliances at any time, any place,'' Lauterback said.   Another highlight of this year's show was the growing home officeequipment industry.   CES officials say 20 million Americans are working out of theirhomes, bringing a boom in a wide range of products from facsimilemachines to telephones, copiers and other equipment.   Industry officials say more than 26 million telephones were soldin the United States last year.   Murata, which hopes to capture 18 percent of the growing faxmarket, showcased a number of machines _ pushing a model selling for$899.   Ricoh featured a hand-held copier, the MC50, that scans theoriginal and copies any point desired. A companion interface moduleturns the MC50 into a facsimile transceiver, with the unit acting asa scanner for the original material being transmitted or receivedvia telephone.   Smith Corona featured a word processor with a feature known asAddress Merge, which enables the user to merge a list of names andaddresses with a standard letter.   Franklin Computer featured an electronic dictionary, thesaurusand phonetic spelling corrector including more than 83,000 words.Known as the Language Master 4000, the user enters a word the way itsounds. The unit then displays the definition of the word, the partsof speech, hyphenation points and inflected forms of the word. Theunit also pronounces the word.   Health and fitness continued to be a major interest at the show.   Casio introduced what it called the world's first electronicpedometer. The watch is touted to give accurate readings of caloricconsumption during workouts. Casio says that unlike mechanicalpedometers, the new EXW50 will automatically adjust to the type ofexercise being performed, such as jogging, aerobics, etc.   Audio-video was again a big draw, with industry officialspredicting Americans would buy 20 million color TV sets in 1989.   Companies went to great lengths to gain an edge with dealers anddistributors who will be putting their products on display shelvesthis year. Pioneer showcased a $10,000 car audio-video system in a$295,000 hand-built Gambella Avalanche sports car.   Tyco introduced Hot Lixx, a computerized electric guitar thatallows players to use a series of buttons in lieu of strings,creating their own musical sounds.   Acclaim introduced a series of video games including Airwolf,after the television series, and Nightrider, which involves``driving'' a car to 20 different cities.   Atari announced it would bring out 20 new game titles in thefirst quarter of 1989.
