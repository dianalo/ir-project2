Police threatened violence but did not use it on the would-beprotesters in Wenceslas Square in central Prague that since Sundayhad been the site of daily demonstrations.   The unrest marked the most sustained display of dissatisfactionwith the government since the Soviet invasion in 1968.   The worst violence of the week came Thursday, when at least ninepeople were injured as hundreds of police with truncheons charged acrowd of more than 2,000 people calling for a free press, freeelections and freedom of assembly.   Several dozen people were arrested Thursday, according to theofficial media. Activists said at least 20 leading dissidentsremained held Friday.   Activist Petr Uhl of the human rights group Charter 77 said TomasHradilek, a spokesman for the movement, was detained Friday at workin Lipnik nad Becvou in Moravia, about 180 miles east of Prague.   Uhl said the detention meant that all three of Charter 77'sspokesmen were in custody. It appeared that Hradilek would be heldfor 48 hours, he said.   As soon as people began gathering Friday on Wenceslas Square,police in vans circled the half-mile-long boulevard flanking thesquare and said through bullhorns: ``Citizens, your gathering isunlawful.''   Police warned that riot police would move in if crowds did notdisperse.   Fifteen minutes later, officers blocked side streets leading tothe top half of the square and formed a human cordon across itscenter. Plainclothes and uniformed riot police jostled thosereluctant to disperse.   The Communist Party daily Rude Pravo, in a front-page editorialFriday, denounced the unrest as an attempt to restore the democracythat existed before the communist takeover in 1948.   ``A return to the conditions of the bourgeois republic is ... outof the question,'' the daily said. ``Let's emphasize thisunequivocally, no matter who dislikes it.''   The unrest started Sunday with a rally to commemorate Jan Palach,a student who committed suicide by setting himself afire in January1969 to protest the 1968 invasion.   Charter 77 planned a vigil Saturday at Palach's grave in thevillage of Vsetaty, 18 miles north of Prague.   Two police cars Friday were stationed on roads leading to thevillage, and a plainclothes policeman at the entrance to thecemetery said the area where Palach's urn was buried was closed. Asign said the closure was for ``technical reasons.''   In Prague, plainclothes police disrupted a report by an Austriantelevision reported who was not allowed to finish the taping inWenceslas Square.   The unrest reflects the desire of many Czechoslovaks for morefreedom and political reforms than the government has been willingto accept.   But the demonstrations also have made clear that the activistsare a minority in a society that, despite growing economic problems,still has one of the highest standards of living in the East bloc.   The official media has repeatedly blamed Charter 77 and otherindependent groups for the unrest.   Charter 77 member Anna Sabatova said several of the jaileddissidents have been told they will be prosecuted.   On Thursday, 15 former communists sent a letter to theCzechoslovak government urging a halt to the ``media campaign''against Charter 77. They also demanded the release of jaileddissidents, said one of the signatories, former Foreign MinisterJiri Hajek.</TEXT></DOC>
