When the fixed-consecutive-number schedule is used(on which at least a specified consecutive number of responses must bemade on one operandum before a single response on another will producea reinforcer), response rate tends to invariant but reinforcement frequencyis not. This study asks whether the differences in reinforcement frequencythat usually accompany changes in stimulus control could themselves beresponsible for the performance differences. Two versions of the fixed-consecutive-numberschedule of reinforcement were combined into a multiple schedule withinwhich stimulus control was varied but differences in reinforcement frequencywere minimized by omitting some reinforcer deliveries during the componentthat usually had the higher reinforcement frequency. In one component,a compound discriminative stimulus was added with the eighth consecutiveresponse on the first lever, a single response on the second lever wasthen reinforced. In the other component, no such stimulus was presented.With no added stimulus, large decreases occurred in the number of runssatisfying the minimum requirement for reinforcement at doses of drugthat produced only minimal changes when an added stimulus controlledbehavior. Thus, increased stimulus control diminishes the behavioralchanges produced by d-amphetamine even when the possible contributionby baseline reinforcement rate is minimized. 17 references, 6 figures,4 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
