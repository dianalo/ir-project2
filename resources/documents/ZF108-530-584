(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>X WINDOW WAS DEVELOPED back in the '80s to mimic PC-style interfaces on Unixterminals.andP;  In a quirk of fate, the system has caught on as a de facto userinterface standard both in environments that are terminal-bound and thosethat are not.andM;The rapid rise of the X Window System (XWS) is not so much a reflection ofthe technology as it is due to four factors that are of greatest relevance tovendors:andM;* The industry is eager for standards.andM;* X is available from a neutral source (MIT).andM;* The source code is free.andM;* X confines itself to defining mechanisms, not policies.andM;X solved some problems for vendors, but what does it give users? As wemigrate toward a distributed computing environment, will X be a strategicunderpinning or a tactical option with a limited future? Turns out, theanswer to that question depends on the user.andP;  For those seeking to extend thelife of minicomputer systems, X is an obvious choice.andP;  But it's not so clearfor those who want today's purchases to fit into a strategic framework.andO;Users should beware: They may have inordinately high expectations of X as thebasis for the evolution to standards-based networked applications, and,ultimately, to open distributed computing environments.andP;  In this article, welook at the pitfalls and the promise of X, and its role in the migration todistributed computing.andM;Word War of Two WorldsandM;COMBINIING THE terminologies of two worlds is awkward.andP;  In the X WindowSystem camp, server is the device on the desktop and client is what runs mostof the application-exactly the reverse of the terminology in the mini and LANenvironments.andP;  In this article, we use the terms in pairs: the first reflectsto the prevailing mindset in the office, and the second, within parentheses,is understandable by X fans.andP;  Thus, workstation(server) is whatever is at thedesktop-regardless of its species; host(client) is whatever processes theapplication.andM;What is X?andM;The X Window System is a system-independent facility designed to allow thescreen presentation to run remotely from the rest of the application in amanner transparent to the user and painless to the programmer.andP;  With XWindow, all graphics (interface and others) are done on the local workstation(server).andP;  But the host(client) is involved as well; it issues the interfacecommands to workstation(server).andM;The X Window System shields the programmer from the nitty-gritty of specificsfor networks, and it also has some handy features such as a clipboardcut-and-paste facility.andP;  In addition, the X Window System permits display ofmultiple windows of processes.andP;  And, power to the user, these processes canbe on single or multiple hosts(clients) on the network.andM;Pros and Cons of XandM;Let's look at some pros and cons of the X Window System.andP;  Pro:andM;* The X Window System is a de facto standard embraced by a host of vendors.andO;It is one windowing system that works on a variety of platforms.andP;  Forstarters, in addition to Unix, it has been implemented on DOS, DigitalEquipment's VMS, and IBM's MVS and VM, with plans for OS/400 and OS/2Extended Edition (EE).andP;  On the workstation side, X Window System is availableon DOS, MS Windows, Xterminals, and Unix workstations.andP;  Versions forPresentation Manager are expected.andM;* The X Window System is network based.andP;  The application is separated fromthe details of network specifics.andP;  Without any changes, the application's twoportions-the graphics display and the application code - can  either runentirely on a workstation or be split between a desktop device acting as aterminal(server) and a host(client).andP;  There are some basic facilities forcutting and pasting between applications written to the X Window System.andM;* In a distributed environment, it's possible to have a consistent X-basedgraphical user interface (GUI) across applications that may reside ondifferent processors-if the Unix GUI wars ever calm down, that is.andP;  Both OSFand Unix International have offered their X-based toolkits-Motif andOpenLook, respectively-as industry standards, and neither has yet emerged asthe winner.andM;* The X Window System separates developers from the operating system.andM;* The X Window System does a great job of bringing GUIs to the Unix world ofterminals.andM;Con:andM;* A single look-and-feel is not assured.andP;  One of the reasons for the rapidadoption of the X Window System was that it concentrated on the skeleton(behavior) and left the clothing (look and feel) up to the marketplace.andP;  Thelook and feel of an X-based application is up to the Window Manager.andP;  TheWindow Manager is in charge of display functionality (e.g., move and resizewindows, iconification, de-iconification, and so forth).andP;  Motif and OpenLookoffer different window managers; therefore, one can have diverse applicationson a single system that look and act differently.andM;* There are also a few diverse X-based Desktop Managers (or user-interfaceshells) to choose from.andP;  Desktop managers govern the way applications arelaunched, the way files are tied to applications, etc.andP;  Users shouldscrutinize the Window and Desktop Managers carefully for desiredfunctionality, interface consistency, compatibility and ease of use.andM;* Additional problems may arise from the coexistence of Window Managers thatdon't know how to keep their applications in synch with each other.andP;  Luckily,a police officer called the ICCCM, or InterClient Communications ConventionManual, was recently added to the X Window System.andP;  Compliance with ICCCMensures that window managers will keep their windows from getting in eachother's way, etc.andP;  The ICCCM has to do with toolkit specifications, notapplication development; thus, toolkits shield the developer from ICCCM.andP;  Thesafest way to ensure harmony among elements is to procure from the samevendor the additional system software components, such as Window and Desktopmanagers, and check that all components are (or aren't) compliant with ICCCM.andO;The advisability of restricted choices sacrifices the promise of &quot;opensystems.&quot;andM;* Compatibility among applications is not assured when applications useextensions beyond the X Window System.andP;  Remember, X Window System isrelatively bare-boned, and doesn't ;over such facilities as an imaging model,Display PostScript, or 3-D graphics.andP;  When applications are written to suchextensions, they cannot run on systems that lack these extensions.andP;  Theresoon could be two or more species of X Window System applications, those withand without Display PostScript.andP;  IBM, Digital, and Sun use Display PostScriptin their X Window Systems.andP;  Data General does not yet implement DisplayPostScript.andM;* Applications need to be written for X to function in its environment.andO;Simply slapping the basic X on a system doesn't even provide cut-and-pastecapability between existing applications.andM;* The short list of available applications isn't a compelling reason foroffice users to switch to an X Window System.andM;Window and Desktop ManagersandM;Two layers sit above the X Window System and add the functionality a userexpects-the window manager and the desktop manager.andP;  (See Illustrations 1 and2.)andM;The Window Manager is described by some as providing the border decor.andO;Actually, the window manager is responsible for all window manipulation, butthe applications themselves contain the code indicating exactly how theirparticular windows will be scrolled, sized, etc.andP;  A window manager is toolkitindependent, but many toolkits-including Motif, OpenLook, Looking Glass(Visix Software), and Object Interface (Solbourne Computer) offer a windowmanager.andM;The Desktop Manager is an application (or a bunch of applications) thathandles desktop functions-icon display and creation-as well as establishinglinks between icons and underlying programs and data.andP;  The Desktop Manageralso launches applications.andM;There are various other elements that make X Window System work, such as atoolkit and XLib and the release level of X Window System itself.andP;  Let'sstart at the bottom and work up.andP;  Most current software incorporates X11.3,but subsequent releases give better performance, font-handling, andreliability.andP;  Although source-level compatibility is a goal, the XConsortium, curator of the X Window System, recommend:; a recompile.andO;Apparently, one needn't worry if a different release is embodied in theworkstation(server) software for a PC.andM;XLib is the collection of basic routines that comprise the X Window System.andO;Staying within the bounds of XLib and ICCCM is the key criterion for X Windowcompatibility.andM;The toolkit provides some higher level facilities than XLib to createapplications.andP;  Multiple toolkits can be coresident on a system, eachsupporting its own suite of applications.andP;  Most commercial toolkits have anaccompanying window manager, although window managers are toolkit independent(unless the window manager is in gross negligence of X's ICCCNM).andP;  OpenLookactually has two toolkits-one is a lower-layered version of the other.andP;  Visixhas its own toolkit, but its interface looks like Motif, and Solbourne's,which also has its own toolkit, can look either like OpenLook or Motif.andM;PCs Talk XandM;Given the population of PC users, one likely scenario is for X Window Systemsto become the ubiquitous terminal mode for various intelligent workstations.andO;Think of it as the GUI analog to the VT100.andP;  OSF/Motif was intended toresemble Presentation Manager so users could make an easy transition betweenthe two.andM;There are several products that provide X Window System facilities for PCs.andO;Users investigating adding X Window System functionality to their PCs shouldmake the same level of investigation on these products that they do whenprocuring PCs rather than assume that the X Window System product willautomatically avail itself of the native PC's capabilities.andP;  For instance,items of consideration should be screen resolution, color, memoryutilization, use of existing mice, how the user switches betweenenvironments, what Window Manager is operative, what networks are supported,and whether or not there is a remote link to the X host(client).andP;  Here are afew products to illustrate the range of capabilities and prices.andM;VISIONWARE'S XVISION.andP;  In line with the theme of consistency of userinterface, VisionWare Limited of Leeds, England, has some solutions thatutilize MS Windows for its cut and paste, windowing, and drivers.andM;VisionWare's XVision is an MS Windows-based X Window System server that usesMS Windows drivers so XVision can run any peripherals supported by MSWindows.andP;  With XVision, the user can elect at start-up time to use either MSWindows or a host(client)-based X Window manager.andP;  Interestingly, the MSWindows choice ensures that the GUI is run locally at theworkstation(server).andP;  If you choose X Window System in this environment, itmeans the GUI is run on the host(client) and merely represented locally although X doesn't mandate that you distribute the GUI this way).andM;XVision offers options for cut-and-paste.andP;  Between two X Window Systemapplications, the X Window System selection mechanism is used, but the dataselected can also be put on the MS Windows clipboard, thus allowing data tobe copied between X Window System clients  applications, managers, etc.) andDOS applications.andP;  One can put the entire X Window System world within theconfines of one MS Window, or allow each X client to have its own MS Window,which off-loads some of the host processing load down to the PC, according toVisionWare.andP;  The package sells for $449 with discounts for multiple copies.andM;The current Version 3 of XVision will support the MS Windows 3 and will takeonly the memory required by MS Windows 3.andP;  Version 3 will support color andinclude a pop-up dialog box for starting an X client, an X Window System fontcompiler, and the X mechanism for keyboard-mapping.andP;  As with other PCemulations of X Windows, one can continue to use a two-button mouse viaemulation facilities, although VisionWare says a three-button mouse is ideal.andO;No special software is required for the host system.andM;PC Connect from VisionWare.andP;  VisionWare recommends use of XVision inconjunction with another product designed for plain Unix applications, PCConnect, which provides a front end for file transfer, fancier (VT 220)terminal emulation, and icons.andP;  PC Connect sits on both the host(client) andworkstation(server), and prices vary according to the number of users.andM;Not in the world of X Window System per se, but very interesting, is adeveloper's version of PC Connect that supplies tools to impart Microsoft'sprogrammers' interface, including Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE), to host-basedUnix applications so they can be called via DOS DDE applications.andP;  Prices forPC Connect depend on the size of the host and number of users, and range from$495 to $38,835.andM;HCL-EXCEED FROM HUMMINGBIRD.andP;  Hummingbird Communications Limited, Markham,Ontario, also has a suite of products to turn PCs into X Windows servers, butthe products have their own set of drivers rather than MS Windows support.andO;The basic product, HCL-eXceed, supports VGA with 16 colors and LIM orextended memory support, if available.andP;  It also features a Telnet facilityfor remote access of a host as an ASCII terminal.andP;  Generally, this product isrecommended for 286-based PCs with 640KB or 1MB of memory.andM;Another version, HCL-eXceed Plus, is a protected mode version that providesup to 16MB of memory directly accessible to X clients, thus abolishing the64K limitation on stored screen-images and fonts.andP;  It has been rewritten tomake direct calls to the PC for server optimization, but it also supportsvarious memory management schemes, the company said.andP;  The price is $545.andM;Users wanting to upgrade the resolution on their screens to 8514Acaliber-1024 by 768@an elect Hummingbird's HCL-eXceed Plus/8514A X server andan 8514A-compatible board such as the Magnum Series from Matrox ElectronicSystems, based in Dorval, Quebec.andP;  This $595 product combines variousextended mode features with 8514A support.andP;  The 8514A version supportsresolutions of 1,024 by 768 and up to 16 or 256 colors, depending on theboards, which cost $1,395 and $1,695, respectively.andP;  Because the HCL-eXceedPlus/8514A interfaces directly with the registers of the 8514A controller,the performance of the server is increased by 200 to 300 percent, Hummingbirdclaimed.andM;Another product, HCL eXtend, lets users transfer files between DOS and Unixenvironments.andP;  It is designed to operate with the previous X Window Systemservers and costs  495 for each Unix host.andM;LOCUS'S PC XSIGHT.andP;  Locus Computing Corporation, Inglewood, California, hasbeen laboring in the DOS-Unix fields for some time.andP;  It has two versions ofPC XSight, an X Windows server for DOS PCs.andP;  The full-bodied implementation,Release 2.1, supports up to 16MB of extended memory and an extensive list ofgraphics adapters.andP;  Its Quick Access to DOS lets users run DOS applicationswithout exiting the server.andP;  One can suspend the server and run DOS, but mustexit DOS to return to the X Windows server.andP;  A minimum of 1.5MB isrecommended.andP;  The price is $425, or  495 with TCP/IP for DOS, Basic Services.andM;For the minimalists, Locus offers PC XSight/640 Release 1.2, which runs on8086/88 systems and is designed to run within 640K, although it does supportexpanded memory.andP;  This provides limited function.andP;  Realistically, the usercan expect to run a simple window manager plus two &quot;xterms&quot; and a clock, or asimilar environment.andP;  But, like its big brother, PC XSight/ 640 providesQuick Access to DOS, although functionality depends on memory availability.andO;Prices start at $195; or $225 with Locus TCP/IP for DOS, Basic Services.andM;X ON THE MAC.andP;  Apple has promised an X Windows server that will run on theMac Finder and allow a choice of window managers.andP;  But, so far, that producthas not emerged.andP;  Apple did announce, for summer delivery, the long-overdueA/UX Version 2.0 that gives users a Mac interface and will allow them to runsimultaneously Mac, X Window System, and A/UX applications.andM;XterminalsandM;As an alternative to Unix workstations on each desk, the category of X WindowSystem terminal (Xterminal) was born.andP;  Generally it's a screen, with a fairamount of memory and some specialized processing power (it may have graphicschips) but no disk or ability to do local applications processing.andM;With prices generally in the range of $2,500 and up, the Xterminal couldinitially be caught in a price squeeze between the increasingly powerful PCand the increasingly less expensive Unix machine-a low-end Sun or a 386/486system.andP;  However, in the end, we expect Xterminal prices to decreasedramatically and the products to become increasingly popular.andP;  The advantageof Xterminals, however, is that they do not need support; while tyingexisting PCs into an X environment may seem attractive, the expense of thesupport involved negates any advantage.andM;Discerning buyers are discovering that not all Xterminals are created equal.andO;Criteria for Xterminals include ease of memory expansion, consistency of dotsper inch across different models, performance, and the usual ergonomicissues.andP;  Network Computing Devices, a maker of Xterminals, observes thatperformance bottlenecks can occur in three areas: communications software,the Xserver processing, and the graphics generation (both hardware andsoftware).andM;One should examine whether the accompanying communications software offersfeatures such as Telnet to connect to non-X environments and a &quot;hot key&quot;facility between Telnet windows and the X environment.andP;  Other areas ofinterest are the ease of setup and assistance in administration ofconfiguration tables.andP;  mode, the PC can either ask the shared resource(host)for snippets of data (as in SQL server) or have part of an application thatalso runs on the shared resource(host).andM;PM/X.andP;  Microsoft plans to be a player in the distributed world and has acouple of projects underway.andP;  One proj -  Alternatives to XandM;What are the alternatives to X? We couldn't find any direct analogies withdistributed displays, but Microsoft comes to mind when the search is extendedto include the PC world.andM;The PC world assumes an intelligent workstation that generates its owndisplay.andP;  In addition to running in standalone ect is dubbed PM/X although ithas nothing to do with the X Window System.andP;  The goal of PM/X is a common setof application program interfaces (APIs) that would allow a PM application toalso run on Unix with relatively little additional work by the developer.andO;This means that Microsoft has to rewrite Presentation Manager from assemblylanguage to C, so it can be used with Unix.andP;  This would allow a user to writeto a single user interface API and take advantage of the local processingpower and have either OS/2 or Unix on the shared resource system.andM;Thus, Microsoft can be said to be positioning Presentation Manager as theubiquitous user interface that will ultimately be available on a variety ofworkstations and shared resources.andP;  That could give the X Window System somehefty competition.andM;Although Microsoft is expected to offer an X Window System facility withinPM, it is not developing any X Window System products because it believes theappropriate design model involves use of processing power at the desktop.andM;Points to consider: PM provides the equivalent of both the window and desktopmanager; the momentum for software developers should be substantial; PMutilizes the power at the user's desktop and familiar applications.andM;If you reject the argument that the world will soon be populated with OS/2desktops, DOS users can also access either OS/2 or Unix shared resources viaLAN Manager and its counterpart, LAN Manager/X.andM;In both the X Window System and PC worlds, the ISV has to make choices.andP;  Inthe X Windows System world, the choice is between Window Managers; in theMicrosoft arena, the choice is between Presentation Manager and MS Windows.andM;A Choice or Display Platforms.andP;  The slow transition from DOS to OS/2 can slowthe development of applications by presenting the ISV with three platformchoices-MS Windows, Presentation Manager, and X Window System-and chances areslim that many applications will blanket all three.andM;While you can use a DOS PC as an X Window Server, DOS is handicapped by itssingle-tasking limitations.andP;  A key benefit of the X Window System is multiplewindows into active applications, but, because DOS is single tasking, you canonly have one live DOS window.andP;  (Microsoft hints that Windows 3 will haveimproved facilities in the multitasking arena.) You can, however, havemultiple active windows into Unix or another multitasking host(client).andM;Clearly the lure is to have a desktop-resident multitasking operating systemto rival the capabilities present on Unix-based systems.andP;  Enter OS/2, nowperceived as a Unix competitor for the desktop and low-end servers.andP;  Perhapssomewhat ironically, the appeal of multiple live windows on the Unix/X WindowSystem will prompt the acceptance of OS/2 and Presentation Manager on thedesktop.andM;Major Vendors' StancesandM;Major vendors show no signs of focusing more on the X Windows System as apath to cooperative processing than other methods.andP;  Many have multipleefforts in progress; no vendor is relying solely on X Windows System for itsfuture product line.andP;  As can be seen, there is a lot of activity involvinglinking PCs to diverse platforms.andP;  A quick poll revealed several approaches:andM;* Use the X Window System in the Unix environment.andM;* Put the X Window System on additional workstations andandM;hosts.andM;* Push the envelope on what parts of the application get dis -  tributedwithin the X Window System environment.andM;* Use remote procedure calls to link workstations to hosts andandM;to each other.andP;  Some integrate with X Window Systems whereandM;appropriate; some don't use the X Window System at all.andM;IBM.andP;  IBM is contemplating developing a new implementation of itsOfficeVision requestor as both the X client and X server.andP;  LikeHewlett-Packard, it is trying to facilitate applications development where itis transparent to the programmer whether the entire application runs on theworkstation(server) or is split between the workstation(server) andhost(client).andP;  The X Window System currently offers this facility.andM;But in putting OfficeVision-type applications on top of the X Window System,IBM intends to buttress, with a higher-level service, lesser level ofconnectivity inherent in the X protocols.andP;  IBM would like to provide thelevel of connectivity found in the SAA world using LU6.2 (though IBM has notcommitted to using LU6.2 in its X implementation).andP;  IBM says 6.2 assumes a&quot;stateful&quot; connection, which means there is a shared set of information thatis maintained until the session is broken.andP;  The state is known to each andcan be used to synchronize activities, IBM indicated.andP;  Thus, applicationsneed not double-check on message delivery, etc.andP;  A typical Unix remoteprocedure call (RPC) has a &quot;stateless connection,&quot; in which no assumption ismade of previous occurrence, IBM observed.andM;IBM is eager to avoid the requirement for humungous workstations, and islooking at the feasibility of using Xterminals with the bulk of theapplication and requestor/ server code on the LAN.andM;IBM plans to offer the X Window System on all of its SAA platforms, includingthe AS/400.andP;  The implementation will be the client version on the MVS, VM,and OS/400.andM;DIGITAL EQUIPMENT CORPORATION.andP;  Digital EquipmentandM;Corporation's standard user interface is DECwindow, which implements XWindowas a means to distribute display.andP;  DECWindows is being put on a wide range ofworkstations(servers) as well as on both VMS and Ultrix hosts(clients), soapplications can run remotely or locally, whichever is more efficient.andP;  Amongthe workstations(servers) targeted for the X Window System: Unix, VMS, DOS,OS/2, and Macintosh.andP;  Office applications such as DECwrite and DECdecisionare being created to run under DECWindows.andM;HEWLETT-PACKARD.andP;  Hewlett-Packard is advocating its NewWave ComputingArchitecture with its distributed object architecture as the common elementamong its MPE and Unix hosts as well as various desktops.andP;  NewWave iscurrently on DOS and is slated for OS/2 and the X Window System, where itwill function as a desktop manager.andP;  The core of NewWave is the ObjectManagement Facility (OMF), which facilitates agent/task automation and hotlinks.andP;  As with Digital, users will be able to access either the proprietary(MPE) or Unix host without knowing or caring which is which.andP;  A key componentin the forthcoming NewWave Computing is Apollo's Network Computing System(NCS), whose remote procedure call is included in the DEcorum proposal.andM;As a first step to putting NewWave on top of X Window System and Motif, HPannounced a Visual User Environment, which implements a drag-and-dropmetaphor on top of Unix.andM;DATA GENERAL.andP;  Data General is touting its Distributed ApplicationsArchitecture (DAA) as its umbrella concept whose goal is to give usersutility-like access to computing power, tying in both its proprietary (AOS)and Unix hosts as well as a variety of workstations.andP;  Like other schemes, DAAis trying to make transparent to the user where applications or parts thereofare executed and where information resides.andP;  Although DAA uses NewWave on DOSmachines and Visix's Looking Glass on X Windows, DAA is desktop independent.andO;In addition, DG has endorsed HP's OMF and is expected to make substantial useof this technology.andP;  At the LAN level, DG is endorsing Netwise's RPC as atool to cleave applications.andM;DG has announced its DAA &quot;Open LAN&quot; software developer kit (SDK) that it sayshelps delineate how to cleave applications between the workstation(server)and host(client).andP;  The Open LAN toolkit includes the Netwise RPC tool todistribute pieces of applications without worrying about the underlyingtransport.andP;  DG currently is offering Portable NetWare; support for LANManager 2.0 is expected within the next year.andP;  The plan is that applicationscan simply be relinked with the appropriate library to run on the other LAN,without additional development.andM;Because the Netwise RPC runs on Ethernet and TCP/IP, it is conceivable thatdevelopers could use X Windows to distribute the display and the RPC todistribute the processing.andP;  But the DG toolkit is targeted toward the DOSworld,andM;NCR.andP;  NCR's Open Cooperative Computing (OCC) strategy involves NewWave on DOSand OS/2 (when available) and the X Window System on intelligentworkstations(servers), but, at present, there is no X Window System onhosts(clients).andP;  OCC will rely heavily on LAN Manager and LM/X in conjunctionwith some NCR remote procedure calls.andP;  Eventually, NCR plans to provide X onits Unix client.andP;  WANG.andP;  Wang is providing ClearView as a desktop manager onboth the X Window System and Motif as well as on DOS.andP;  And it is embracingSanta Cruz Operation's (SCO's) Open Desktop, which uses the X Window Systemand Motif, on its 386/486 boxes.andP;  But the bulk of Wang's distributed effortsfocuses on DOS and LANs through a combination of facilities that are LANindependent and run on its VS and its new Intel box.andP;  There are no plans toput X Windows on its VS hosts.andM;Is X Window System the Answer?andM;Applications availability will continue to be a driving force in users'decisions regarding platforms.andP;  Although the X Window System offers the lureof a range of workstations(servers) and hosts(clients), it has heavycompetition for ISV attention in the form of MS Windows and PresentationManager.andP;  And while the major systems players in the office arena are, ingeneral, going with X on their Unix platform, most have yet to deliver newgeneration products under Unix.andM;Should users rush out and get aboard the X Window bandwagon? Depends.andP;  The XWindow System is a reasonable choice for those users with host-based systemswho want to make a change now, feel uncomfortable playing the waiting game,and/or fear future solutions won't be vendor independent.andM;They can select either PCs with X Window System capability, Xterminals, orUnix workstations.andM;But the larger issue of whether to adopt the X Window System soon is probablydictated more by the users' opinions on where applications should beprocessed-locally or centrally-than by price.andM;Should users who are already heavily into PCs add the X Window System? Userswith relatively powerful PCs waiting for cooperative solutions may be inequally good positions as those that embark now on the X Window System.andO;There is frenetic activity among players and would-be players in the emergingrace toward distributed computing environments.andP;  The early  90s should beinteresting.andP;  PC users might want to wait until more options are apparentbefore rushing to the X Window System.andP;  They can always add it and use it forits terminal access on top of a Windows, Presentation Manager, or otherenvironment.andM;Smart vendors will probably improve their links between the DOS/OS/2 and XWindow System worlds.andP;  Logical capabilities include hooks for Microsoft'sDynamic Data Exchange and Hewlett-Packard's OMF, for starters.andM;There is not now any single road to the holy grail of distributed computingenvironment.andP;  The X Window System can he one step toward the goal, but, atbest, it is merely a piece of one alternative among several emerging options.andO;Target Platform for Desktop UnixandM;SANTA CRUZ Operation's (SCO's) Open Desktop is an attempt to offer users aprepackaged, graphical Unix/DOS system with X Window System.andP;  The system isdesigned to run on top of Unix V/386 and includes the following elements:andM;* Toolkit and Window Manager-MotifandM;* Desktop Manager-IXI's X.desktopandM;* Relational database-RTI's Ingres (with publishedandM;* APIs so others can also play)andM;* PC Integration-LocusandM;* Networking-NFS Client, LAN Manager Client, TCP/ IPandM;The $995 package represents a good value and a focal point for developers ofdesktop Unix applications.andP;  Look for our complete evaluation of Open Desktopin the June issue of Unix in the Office.)andM;COOPERATIVE PROCESSING MODELSandM;WHEN DESIGNERS PONDER how to create a Distributed Computing Environment (DCE)world in which the user is empowered and functionality is transparentregardless of its location, one of the schemes that comes to mind iscooperative processing.andP;  There are three models for cooperative processingthat involve the distribution of display, data, and function.andP;  The highestlevel of cooperative processing involves the distribution of not only thedisplay, but of the function and data as well.andM;* Display: The X Window System exemplifies the distribandM;-  uted display model as it runs parts of the display code inandM;the various workstations(servers).andM;* Data: Data from a single application can be located on anyandM;number of clients and/or servers.andP;  The user should be ableandM;to obtain remote data in exactly the same fashion as localandM;data, with no additional hassle.andM;* Function: The user should be able to distribute applicationandM;code across platforms, so that some functions are placed atandM;the workstations(servers).andP;  An example is mail that hasandM;creation capabilities residing locally with a seamless facilandM;-  ity for directory lookup on a remote system.andM;Although the X Window System itself is neutral in terms of helping orhindering the development of distributed applications, it does adequatelyimplement the display level of DCE.andP;  Distributed display alone, however, doesnot give you full distributed computing, Thus, X Window System alone is notthe complete answer.andP;  Other pieces must fall into place, including somestandardization on the elements now under review by the OSF.andM;DEcorum, one proposal to OSF by a group of vendors, gathers varioustechnology pieces that, when intertwined, are purported to facilitate much ofthe needed transparency for a DCE.andP;  Among the DEcorum elements are adistributed file system, remote procedure call facility (RPC), presentationservices, and naming service.andP;  An RPC is a facility that lets programs callsubroutines on different machines, while the presentation services ensurethat data from one machine is translated to another machine type.andM;(Illustrations omitted)</TEXT></DOC>
