<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-05-0884 </DOCNO><TEXT>The integrity and service life of a pipeline will depend, to a large extent,on the fracture toughness properties and subcritical crack growth resistanceof pipes with defects either inherently present or introduced duringconstruction or service. Unstable fracture from crack like defects canoccur if the fracture toughness of the line pipe material is inferior,whereas subcritical crack growth can occur under sustained load and cyclicallyvarying loads (fatigue). Both of these subcritical growth mechanismscan be strongly influenced by the internal pipe environment (hydrogensulfide, carbon dioxide) and external environment (corrosion, cathodicprotection). A case history of the application of fracture mechanicsfor evaluating the static fracture toughness and subcritical crack growthresistance of an external longitudinal weld toe crack is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
