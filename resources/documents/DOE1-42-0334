Previous FTIR measurementshave identified several tyrosine residues that change their absorptioncharacteristics between light-adapted BR and dark-adapted BR, or betweenintermediates K and M. These changes were explained by protonation/deprotonationof tyrosine moieties and perturbation of the protein environment surroundingtyrosines. A tyrosine deprotonation was observed to occur between intermediatesK and M. The present studies confine the deprotonation to being betweenintermediates L and M and show that no tyrosines undergo changes betweenthe K and the L states. Evidence is presented that none of the tyrosinesundergoing changes at low temperature can be assigned to tyrosine-64.The environmental changes of these tyrosines are discussed in relationto the proton pumping mechanism. Their spatial relation to the chromophoreis also discussed. At least two tyrosines are suggested to reside closeto the retinal binding site. The reactive groups of the nitrated tyrosine-64are speculated to be remote from the Schiff base and the active tyrosinesbut can possibly interact sterically with the ionone ring of the retinal.</TEXT></DOC>
