Scott was charged withmurder, aggravated sodomy and burglary.   Allie Morrow Roper, a retired florist, was found dead at herCartersville home Sunday after friends missed her at church.Authorities said she was strangled late Saturday, probably by anintruder.   Harris served as a pallbearer at his aunt's funeral Tuesday.   Hamrick said police identified Scott as a suspect Wednesdaythrough fingerprint evidence processed by the bureau's new automaticfingerprint identification system, which greatly speeds up theprocess of matching fingerprints found at a crime scene withfingerprints on file.   ``It's a new system not fully operational yet,'' Hamrick said ata news conference. ``This is one of the first hits we've made onthis system.''   Police said they did not know whether Scott knew Mrs. Roper, andthey did not have information about his background. No bond was setimmediately, and no court date was scheduled.   Police sought Scott for about 16 hours before his arrest, Hamricksaid, adding that he did not resist arrest when stopped.</TEXT></DOC>
