However, unlike others who went through breakdowns and evensuicide, Tryon emerged from the experience with a brand-new careeras a best-selling author.   Tryon served only 3{ years under the legendary Preminger,starring in ``The Cardinal,'' a 1963 sweeping melodrama.   ``I had a good run,'' says the actor turned author, who madefilms for Paramount Pictures, 20th Century Fox and the Walt DisneyCo. before falling under Preminger's spell. ``And I could have goneon. But I was afraid someone was going to holler at me.''   The late Vienna-born Preminger was best known to the public forportraying sadistic Nazis in such films as ``Margin for Error'' and``Stalag 17.'' He was known to actors as an absolute terror whocould reduce them to tears, as he did with Marilyn Monroe (``Riverof No Return'') and Jean Seberg (``St. Joan,'' ``BonjourTristesse'').   ``I remember the night `The Cardinal' premiered in the ParisOpera House,'' Tryon said. ``There was a party afterward atMaxim's. Everybody was out in the restaurant, and Jean and I werein a little snuggery together. We had just met, and we had thisshared experience of horror that we were so anxious to communicateto each other.   ``That ... (obscenity) came in and started screaming. I'mtalking screaming in the middle of Maxim's. `How dare you be sorude? I know what you're doing: You're talking about me, tellingmean stories!' Jean fled in tears.''   On the second day of filming ``The Cardinal,'' Preminger firedand rehired Tryon within an hour. Tryon said that Premingerconstantly berated him during filming, telling him he was a lousyactor and making him perform the same scene over and over again.   Still slender with an actor's handsomeness at 64, Tryon wasrecently on the talk circuit to promote his new novel, ``The Wingsof the Morning.'' The book has had a curious history, beginning 13years ago when he conferred with Robert Gottlieb, then chief atKnopf publishers.   ``What's this book you're writing?'' Gottlieb inquired.   Tryon replied that he had no book, but that he had beenresearching the history of his hometown in Connecticut, where anancestor had settled in 1640. For three hours Tryon spun tales ofmurder, intrigue and feuds. ``Tom, I want that book,'' Gottliebconcluded. They reached an agreement for the historical novel andanother book. The price: $2 million.   The author plunged into the story and four years later produceda 5,580-page tome. But Gottlieb wanted more. Tryon wrote on,interrupting for other books. Gottlieb left Knopf for the NewYorker, but the new regime remained patient as the saga grew tothree, then four books. ``The Wings of the Morning'' is the firstof what is called the ``Kingdom Come'' quartet.   Tryon was well into his 40s before he turned to writing. Born inHartford, Conn., and reared in Wethersfield, he served in the Navyduring World War II, then enrolled in fine arts at Yale University.After studying art in New York, he painted scenery in the Dennis,Mass., Cape Playhouse. He filled in as a centurion in Shaw's``Anthony and Cleopatra'' and decided to study acting.   After a few small roles on Broadway, Tryon came to Hollywoodunder a Paramount-Hal Wallis contract that cast him in ``TheScarlet Hour,'' ``Screaming Eagles'' and ``A Monster From OuterSpace'' (title role). Walt Disney hired him to star in a TV series,``Texas John Slaughter,'' and the feature ``Moon Pilot.''   His biggest break came when Preminger cast him in the title roleof ``The Cardinal.'' After another Preminger film, ``In Harm'sWay,'' Tryon did a few small features, then drifted into TV guestshots.   Inspired by Ira Levin's ``Rosemary's Baby,'' Tryon tried hishand at a horror novel. ``The Other'' became a best seller and amovie. His other books included ``Harvest Home,'' ``CrownedHeads,'' ``All That Glitters'' and ``Night of the Moonbow.''   Tryon went through analysis to rid himself of the Premingerdemons. He summed up: ``My life is good. Tranquil is a good wordfor it. You know, I quit drinking 10 years ago, and that was amajor change in my life. Because I had the whole thing backward.   ``I thought I was drinking to cover up my nervousness. But whenI stopped drinking all the nervousness went away.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
