The executions, ordered by a Shanghai court, were the first inthe nationwide crackdown on the student-led demonstrations for afreer China.   Television news also said a student leader surrendered toauthorities.   More than 1,000 people have been arrested nationwide since armytroops and tanks moved into Tiananmen Square in Beijing on June 3-4to suppress the movement, which called for freedom of the press andan end to official corruption.   The violent confrontation touched off demonstrations and riots incities throughout China.   On June 6, crowds set a train ablaze after it ran through abarricade erected by demonstrators near Shanghai station, killingsix people.   Official media reported 21 railway security officials were beatenby protesters. It said the rail line was closed for 50 hours, ninetrain carriages ruined and 900 bags of mailed burned.   The three condemned men ``frenziedly smashed the railwaycarriages and set fire to police motorcycles and the carriages''during the attack, the official Xinhua News Agency reported. ``Theyalso prevented firefighters from extinquishing the fire and beatthem cruelly.''   Xinhua identified the men as Xu Guoming, a contract worker at abrewery, Bian Hanwu, who is unemployed, and Yan Xuerong, a radiofactory worker. They were given three days to appeal.   Seven more people were on trial in the case, Shanghai radio said.   Another 26 workers were shown on the noon TV news being led byarmed police onto a stage before a packed hall in the northeasterncity of Changchun.   Several had large placards around their necks giving their namesand their sentence to labor reform, a type of prison. They wereaccused of instigating social unrest and spreading rumors.   The placards were similar to a practice during the 1966-76Cultural Revolution, when ultra-leftist Red Guards paraded theirvictims through the streets wearing humiliating signs on theirchests. Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, who won the power struggleafter Mao Tse-tung's death in 1976, was among those persecutedduring the Cultural Revolution.   At the top of the government's wanted list of dissenters are 21members of the student union that led the pro-democracy movement inBeijing. Official media announced Wednesday that two had beenarrested.   Television reports on Thursday said Xiong Wei, 23, a student atQinghua University, turned himself in to Beijing police aftertraveling from the northeastern city of Shenyang with his mother.   ``He handed over materials he wrote to show his willingness tofully resolve his problem,'' it said as several documents were shown.   The three top student leaders _ Wang Dan, Wu'er Kaixi and ChaiLing _ were among the 18 fugitives remaining on the wanted list.   In Australia, Prime Minister Bob Hawke refused Wednesday todiscuss newspaper reports in his country that the Australian Embassyin Beijing was sheltering Ms. Ling, a 22-year-old psychology studentat Beijing Normal University.   Chinese official media reported more arrests of workers whosupported the seven weeks of pro-democracy demonstrations and thedetention of three men allegedly involved in the attack of a martiallaw soldier killed in Beijing.   Television news on Thursday gave extensive coverage of the motherand the sister of the soldier, Cui Guozheng, meeting top officials.   The government has portrayed troops involved in crushing thepro-democracy movement as heroes.   Its campaign to gain support for the crackdown included a largefront-page editorial Thursday in the Communist Party newspaperPeople's Daily.   The editorial, which was read on television and radio, urged thecountry to ``unite and join forces to fight the common enemy.''   It said ``a great victory already has been achieved in quellingthe counterrevolutionary rebellion. In Beijing and even the wholecountry, the situation is moving toward stability. ... But thestruggle definitely is not over.''   People's Daily said it was important to ``strengthen education''of the many people who participated in the pro-democracy marches.   The government has tried to get citizens to participate in thecrackdown, and publicized several phone numbers in Beijing forresidents to call to report protesters. Beijing television reportedThursday that 1,620 calls had been received.   National television reported that citizen militias had beenformed in the central Chinese city of Qongqing to support securityforces conducting sweeps for government critics.   The government on Wednesday ordered the expulsion of two U.S.correspondents, John Pomfret of The Associated Press and Voice ofAmerica's bureau chief in Beijing, Alan Pessin.   The two were accused of violating martial law regulations thatban foreign reporting on the pro-democracy movement and were given72 hours to leave the country.   Martial law troops continued to patrol Beijing and guard theperimeter of Tiananmen Square, which the military captured from thestudent protesters on June 4.   Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence estimates say up to3,000 people were killed in the assault, most of them civilians. Thegovernment says about 200 people died, half of them soldiers.   The vast plaza remained closed to pedestrians, but workers beganplanting shrubs around the monument to heroes on the square andpainting road dividers that surround Tiananmen.   Officials said today that two months of demonstrations andmartial law _ imposed May 20 _ had cost the city $270 million ineconomic losses, two-thirds from delays in deliveries of rawmaterials and worker slowdowns.</TEXT></DOC>
