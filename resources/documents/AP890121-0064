The monthly, 30 Days, said the Vatican has tentatively scheduledthe trip for either April or September of next year.   The magazine quoted an unidentified Vatican source as saying ``itwould have been unjust to punish an entire Christian community ...for the sole fact that it finds itself living under a morallyreprehensible regime.''   A summary of the report, scheduled to appear in the magazine'sFebruary issue, was sent to news agencies today.   A Vatican spokesman, the Rev. Giovanni D'Ercole, said he wasunaware of any plans for the pontiff to make his first officialvisit to the country. The pope has criticized South Africa'sapartheid policies of racial segregation.   The pontiff made an unscheduled landing in Johannesburg during aSeptember 1988 trip to southern Africa when foul weather andmechanical problems diverted his plane. While at the airport, he metwith Foreign Minister Pik Botha.   The pope is to return to Africa this spring, but he is notscheduled to visit South Africa.   In the past, Catholic bishops in South Africa have advised thepope against visiting the country, whose population of 24 millionincludes more than 2 million Catholics.   But the bishops have recently dropped their opposition, accordingto the magazine, which quoted Archbishop of Durban Denis Hurley assaying: ``The pope must come here soon, (his followers) cannot wait10 years.''</TEXT></DOC>
