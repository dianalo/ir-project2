Scientists use the term ``greenhouse effect'' to refer tomanmade pollution trapped in the atmosphere that is warming up theEarth's surface.   Carbon dioxide, one of the pollutants, is naturally emitted byanimal and plant life. An excessive buildup of that and other gasesresults from the burning of fossil fuel in power plants, factories,homes and cars, as well as agricultural and industrial pollution.   More than 300 scientists and government officials from 40countries and agencies warned in a closing statement that theincrease in greenhouse gases will raise temperatures by 3 to 8degrees before the middle of the next century unless something isdone.   ``Many scientists believe that warming due to greenhouse gaseshas begun,'' the statement said. It said that unless the globalwarming is halted, ``the expected rates and magnitude of climatechange will greatly exceed those experienced since civilizationbegan.''   The scientists said that merely to stabilize carbon dioxideconcentrations, emissions would have to be reduced 50 percent.   But after European countries pointed out they have already takenmany clean air measures, the conference recommended an initial goalof reducing carbon dioxide emissions ``approximately 20 percent of1988 levels by the year 2005.''   About half of the recommended reduction can come from moreefficient use of existing energy supplies, the statement said,noting some countries have shown they are energy savings of 2percent annually.   In an opening day speech Monday, Sen. Timothy E. Wirth, D-Colo.,said the United States could save more than $200 billion a year inenergy costs through improved efficiency in transportation,construction and government.   He cited photovoltaic solar energy as a promising alternative tofossil fuel and said it was time to reexamine nuclear power.``Those nations that have halted the nuclear option are going tohave to reconsider,'' he said.   The scientists called on all nations to ratify the 1987 MontrealProtocol on halting the depletion of the earth's ozone layer byreducing the use of chlorofluorocarbons, or CFCs. On Thursday,Canada became the fourth country to do so.   CFCs are used in aerosol sprays, refrigerator coolant,insulation and industrial cleaning. Once released, the CFCs breakdown the ozone layer, allowing the sun's harmful ultraviolet raysto reach the surface of the earth and thus increasing the incidenceof skin cancer.   The scientists also said global warming from carbon dioxide,methane, nitrous ozide, CFCs and the depletion of the ozone layercould raise sea levels by up to five feet by the year 2050,inundating coastal areas.   In opening the conference, host Prime Minister Brian Mulroneysaid Canada would like to see an International Law of the Air toprotect the atmosphere as the existing Law of the Sea defends theoceans.   But the conference endorsed a suggestion from keynote speakerGro Harlem Brundtland, prime minister of Norway, for work towardsan international convention on atmospheric protection.   The conference also urged the establishment of a ``worldatmosphere fund'' financed by a tax on oil, gas and coal inindustrialized countries to pay for global protection efforts.   The conference had few representatives from the Soviet bloc andno representative from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.   U.S. Rep. George E. Brown, Jr., (D-Calif., sent a messagecomplaining that Washington will drag its feet on environmentalissues ``until an enlightened leader occupies the White House.''   Meetings are planned in Ottawa next year and in Geneva in 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
