North and John M. Poindexterfor any crimes in the Iran-Contra affair, but he indicated he wouldnot do it before a verdict in their trials.   Reagan responded with an emphatic ``no'' when asked by areporter whether he had ruled out granting pardons to North andPoindexter.   He did not elaborate, simply turning and walking from the WhiteHouse's Roosevelt Room, where he had presented the PresidentialMedal of Freedom to Britain's Lord Carrington for his work as NATOsecretary general.   Reagan's comment came one day after he told an interviewer thatit would be wrong to grant any pardons before the trial is over,and suggested he would be out of office when that happens.   Previously, the president has hinted he is leaning toward apardon for North and Poindexter, saying he did not think they wereguilty of any crime and that he doubted any jury would convict them.   White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater went to the Oval Officeto consult with Reagan about his remark Tuesday. Afterward,Fitzwater said the president had understood the question and gavethe answer he wanted.   ``It means there's been no decision'' on pardons, Fitzwatersaid. ``I wouldn't assume that any definitive judgment has beenmade.''   Fitzwater made public Reagan's response when syndicatedcolumnist Carl Rowan asked him in an interview Monday whether hewould pardon North and Poindexter.   ``You can't consider that, Carl, until this case has beenclosed, whichever way it's going to go,'' the president said. ``Topardon somebody before trial leaves a sense of guilt around them, acloud of guilt for the rest of time. And so this is something thatI don't have to face.''   The timing of the Iran-Contra trial is uncertain. U.S. DistrictJudge Gerhard A. Gesell has said he would like to start as early asJune, though lawyers for North and Poindexter have said they wouldlike to delay it until next year.   Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh has proposed starting thetrial in September. Reagan's term ends next Jan. 20.   Poindexter, who was Reagan's national security adviser, andNorth, a former National Security Council staff member, have beencharged along with arms dealers Richard V. Secord and Albert Hakimwith conspiring to illegally divert profits from the U.S.-Iran armssales to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.   Gesell on Tuesday ordered that Hakim and Secord be allowed toexamine thousands of pages of especially sensitive governmentdocuments that may be relevant to their defense.   Government security officials had refused to allow eitherdefendant to inspect the sensitive material. Hakim, an Iranian-bornU.S. citizen, has never had a security clearance; Secord, a retiredAir Force major general, has not been cleared for access toclassified information since he left the government several yearsago.   But the judge ruled that ``no basis exists for depriving eitherof these defendants of their right to determine the relevance andmateriality of classified materials involved in this case.''   Lawyers for Secord and Hakim, however, waived their clients'right to inspect between 35 and 70 sensitive documents to verifyprosecution claims the material is irrelevant to the case.</TEXT></DOC>
