Bill Bradley has plenty ofpractice answering the question he's most often asked these days:Would you accept the vice presidential nomination on a ticket withMichael Dukakis?   ``No, no, no,'' is Bradley's reply, well rehearsed from the days_ not too long ago _ when the 44-year-old Democrat was as oftenasked if he would run for president.   Speculation that the former basketball star was himself eyeingthe White House ended in March, when Bradley threw his sought-aftersupport to the Massachusetts governor.   Bradley's endorsement answered, for 1988 at least, what Bradleyaides had wistfully come to call ``the `P' question.''   Yet, the endorsement gave rise to the next query: Would Bradleyseek or accept the No. 2 slot?   The basketball Hall of Fame member could bring a needed bit ofpizazz to the Dukakis ticket from Bradley's continued celebrityfrom his days playing for Princeton and the New York Knicks.   Also a Rhodes Scholar, the intellectual senator specializes ineconomics and foreign affairs, two areas key to a solid Dukakisplatform. Bradley has already traveled to Boston to counsel Dukakison the Soviets.   Most pragmatically, Bradley is New Jersey's most popularpolitician and could no doubt deliver the state's 16 ElectoralCollege votes.   On the negative side, the Northeastern combination of Bradleyand Dukakis would make a geographically lopsided team.   ``I think Massachusetts and New Jersey have a lot in common, butI don't think they go together on a national ticket,'' Bradley says.   Even more monotonous would be the combination of the two men'sstiff speaking styles. Though a crowd pleaser, Bradley stillstruggles with the wooden delivery that labeled him boring sinceentering politics 10 years ago.   As with the presidency, the ever-studious Bradley says he isunready to be vice president.   The senator always listens first to himself. When advisers toldhim to attend a big-time basketball school, he went to Princeton.When they said go for the pros, he accepted the Rhodes scholarship.In 1978, they told him to run for local office. He got elected tothe Senate.   Last week, Bradley met in private here with Dukakis' campaignchairman Paul Brountas. Aides made no secret that Brountas, who isheading the vice presidential search, was seeking the senator'sinput.   But Bradley and his aides insisted the idea of Bradley on theticket was not discussed.   Bradley says he wants to play a role at the Democratic NationalConvention next month in Atlanta. He has been mentioned as apossible keynote speaker, as one of several promising Democratswith guaranteed roles in the party's future.   But delivering the keynote speech would invite inevitable andunenviable comparisons to the impressive 1984 oratory by Gov. MarioCuomo of New York. Bradley might be more comfortable with alower-profile speech, perhaps nominating Dukakis.   Still young, Bradley has never ruled out the idea of one dayrunning for president.   Aides, meanwhile, say they are preparing for the next question:Which Cabinet post will the senator want?</TEXT></DOC>
