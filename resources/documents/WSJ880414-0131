In fact, our banks reported an all-time high of $35.6 billion in mortgage activity for 1987, compared with the previous year's record $26.6 billion. During the last quarter, which was marked by the October stock-market crash, assets grew by 2.5%; growth in assets for the year was 10.7%. At year end, net worth to assets was reported at 7.08%, up from 6.27% the previous year.    Key factors in the resurgence and financial health of our banks are prudent bank management, consumer confidence based on the savings banks' traditional fiduciary responsibility, a progressive state regulatory and legislative environment and federal deregulation.    The savings-bank industry in New York provides an excellent model for thrift recovery. Before plunging into a new round of regulations and restrictions, government officials should take a look at a system that works.    Robert O.
