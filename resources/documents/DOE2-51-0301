<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-0301 </DOCNO><TEXT>The activation process of bitumous coal dust prior to the onset of visibleglowing has been examined on a variety of apparatus. When a meanderingfilament inside a 14 cm thick layer of coal dust is activated, much highertemperature limits for spontaneous ignition apply than with isothermalheating of an equal volume of coal dust in an oven. Below about 190/sup0/C even an increased input of oxygen will not produce a heat explosionin the special arrangement. Contrary to views held until now the startingreactions proceed endothermally. Oxygen diffuses within a few minuteseven through a 14 cm thick layer of coal dust. Prior to the glowing,which only becomes visible from 500/sup 0/C as a rule, a self-sustainingreaction takes place at temperatures below 350/sup 0/C. There is somesimilarity here with what is termed a 'cool flame' in technical literature.The term 'glowing' is also extended to include this condition. When thereis a reversal of the temperature gradient during such glowing, oxygenpreviously stored in the coal is released without being immediately usedfor a temperature rise.</TEXT></DOC>
