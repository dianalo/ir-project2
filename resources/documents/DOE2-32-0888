The gas chromatographyparameters were optimized for separating atmospheric gases from the fillinggas of multipane insulating glass. Permanent rinsing of the test pieceresults in a state of equilibrium which can be proved easily by continuousmeasurements. This, together, with the simple and efficient sealing method,enabled a low-cost and reliable measurement of the gas loss rate.</TEXT></DOC>
