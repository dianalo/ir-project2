Thereare several steps that now must be taken in the development of this technology.We know that the presence of He{sup 3} within the interior of the shellwill impede the redistribution of the DT. Therefore, the rates at whicha DT fuel layer becomes uniform must be experimentally established. Toallow target designers to evaluate various options, we need to experimentallydetermine the limits on the fuel layers uniformity. In addition, to considerrealistic hardware systems that can produce these targets, we need toestablish the effects that a non-isothermal environment will have onthe fuel layer uniformity. To address some of these questions, KMS Fusionhas designed and constructed an experimental system that provides anisothermal environment from the shell, and allows the fuel layer uniformityto be documented. Preliminary experiments using this system demonstratethat there are several options for using {beta}-decay heat to producea uniform solid fuel layer. These experiments indicate that slowly coolingthe shell through the triple points of the DT fuel mixture results ina significant increase in the uniformity of the initial solid layer.8 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
