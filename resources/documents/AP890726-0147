KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The House voted today to slow the costlystealth bomber program but refused to scrap the radar-evadingwarplane altogether.   Choosing between competing amendments, lawmakers adopted,257-160, a measure by Reps. Les Aspin, D-Wis., and Mike Synar,D-Okla., that would limits the administration to fund production ofonly two bombers in 1990 and 1991. The Pentagon had sought eightbombers.   The amendment to a defense authorization bill would meet thefull request for research and development work over that period butimposes ``a cold-turkey fence of the procurement money untilCongress acts again,'' said Aspin, chairman of the House ArmedServices Committee.   Essentially, the amendment puts off for a full year a finaldecision on whether to fully fund the program until more evidenceis in on the effectiveness and cost of the bomber.   The Senate voted 98-1 Tuesday to back the $530 million B-2stealth bomber if it meets flight test and radar-evasion standardsand trimmed President Bush's $2.1 billion stealth request by arelatively modest $300 million.   White House spokesman B. Jay Cooper said Bush was pleased withthat action but would continue to push for full funding of theplane in the final version of the defense bill that Congressproduces.   Present plans call for production of 132 stealth bombers. Theestimated $70 billion price tag of the program became the focalpoint of the debate.   ``There's no way, no chance to go ahead with the program the wayit's laid out,'' Aspin told the House. ``This amendment tells theAir Force, go back restructure the program and come up with acheaper program with less than 132 aircraft. It gives us a chanceto test this plane enough to know whether we want to go to fullproduction.''   A total of 208 Democrats and 49 Republicans voted for theamendment, while 38 Democrats and 122 Republicans voted against it.   Before that vote, the House rejected amendments that would havethe effect of either scrapping or backing the stealth program.   It defeated, 244-176, an amendment by Rep. Ike Skelton, D-Mo.,which endorsed the program, adopted an $800 million cut approved bythe House Armed Services Committee and imposed flight-testing andradar-evasion standards and restrictions.   On a 279-144 roll call it defeated an amendment sponsored byReps. Ron Dellums, D-Calif., and John Kasich, R-Ohio, which wouldcomplete research and development work on the stealth program butstop further production.   In debate, foes of the radar-evading plane attacked it as anoverly expensive and unneeded weapon whose only purpose is ``tomake the rubble bounce'' after a nuclear exchange.   But defenders of the project said the stealth is an essentialcomponent of the U.S. drive to negotiate deep cuts in Soviet andAmerican missiles. They said the weapon system will stabilizeEast-West tensions because, unlike a missile, it can be recalledafter it is launched.   As debate opened today, Aspin told the House: ``We've hardlytested this plane. What this amendment does is say, slow down theprogram, do the research and development and fence the program.''   He said this approach would provide time to ``come up with aprogram that is politically acceptable and more affordable.''   Rep. Joseph Brennan, D-Maine, contended the stealth would beused only after an exchange of nuclear-armed missiles resulting indevastation in both the United States and the Soviet Union.   ``By that time the war would be lost,'' Brennan said. ``Amission to make the rubble bounce does not justify this spending,''Brennan said.   But Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., said the purpose of asecond-strike radar-penetrating, second-strike weapons such asstealth is to deter the Soviets from launching a first strike.   ``The bomber gives you flexibility,'' said Rep. Norman Dicks,D-Wash. ``You can't do it with cruise missiles because many ofthose (Soviet) targets are mobile targets. It's the combination ofa penetrating bomber and the stand-off cruise missile carrierswhich makes obsolete the $400 billion Soviet investment in airdefense.''   Rep. Thomas Foglietta, D-Pa., predicted cost overruns will pushthe price of the stealth from $500 million each to $1 billion each.   ``Let's vote yes for sanity,'' he said, urging support forkilling the program.   Also pending were amendments to eliminate the MX mobile missileand the competing single-warhead Midgetman missile. Theadministration has requested $1.1 billion to place MX missiles onrailroad cars and $100 million to develop the Midgetman. Both theSenate and House Armed Services committees approved theadministration's request.   The Senate was to resume full debate on the defense billThursday.</TEXT></DOC>
