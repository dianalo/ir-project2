The U.S. company is well known in the Eurobond arena, and has done other financings there recently.    But the key to the solid performance of its 8 7/8%, five-year Eurobonds appeared to be the cautious pricing by lead manager Morgan Stanley International, a 99-basis point spread to U.S. Treasuries. A basis point is 1/100th of a percentage point.    The issue received some help from a late rise in secondary issues. Seasoned Eurodollar bonds edged slightly higher along with the U.S. Treasury markets after dealers were pleasantly surprised by the 0.2% increase in June U.S. producer prices, a smaller change than anticipated. Eurodollar bonds closed about 1/8 to 1/4 point higher.    Meanwhile, Kirin Brewery Co. launched one of the largest equity-linked offerings by a Japanese borrower. The offering totaled $500 million of five-year Eurobonds with equity-purchase warrants, indicating a 2 1/4% coupon at par, and was led by Nikko Securities Co. (Europe).    West German government and Eurobond prices were about 0.20 lower, as the West German government launched a 10-year 6 1/8% issue, priced at par to yield 6.13%, through the Bundesbank.    Dealers said the issue, which totals four billion West German marks ($2.18 billion), was well received.    Swiss franc foreign bonds closed mixed in light turnover, with some issues finding support as confidence returns to the dollar. </TEXT></DOC>
