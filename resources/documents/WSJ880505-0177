Brauchli (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> TAXES EUROP </CO><DATELINE> STOCKHOLM  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Some of Sweden's best-known personalities, like film director Ingmar Bergman and tennis star Bjorn Borg, have at one time or another fled the country to escape its notoriously high taxes. Now, stung by an unfavorable court decision, a lot of Americans and other foreigners assigned to Sweden by their companies are joining the exodus.    The court ruled last year that the steep tax rates apply to certain salary-protection benefits that multinationals commonly offer to expatriate employees. The upshot: Many companies find it impossibly expensive to maintain expatriate employees in Sweden.    &quot;What it will mean is that when you don't have expertise available in Sweden and you want to bring it in, you're faced with a prohibitive price,&quot; says David Varney, the British head of Svenska Shell AB. The company, a unit of the Anglo-Dutch oil giant Royal Dutch/Shell Group, was the target of the landmark tax ruling and now has only a handful of foreigners among its 1,000 employees.    &quot;Expatriates are a way of transferring know-how around the world,&quot; Mr. Varney says. &quot;In Sweden, you have to ask yourself, 'Is it worth the money?' And sometimes you say, 'No.'&quot;    Sweden's Social Democratic government defends the tax policy for its fairness. &quot;It would be a big problem to explain to people why foreigners should have special treatment,&quot; says Claes Ljungh, the political adviser for tax matters at Sweden's Ministry of Finance.    The big crimp on expatriates centers on a device widely used by multinational companies: tax equalization. Typically, companies deduct from the paychecks of employees working overseas the theoretical tax they would have paid their own governments if they had never left home. The companies themselves then pay the income tax owed in the host country.    In some places, such as Hong Kong, where the personal income tax rate is 16%, the policy actually costs employees money. But in other countries -- such as Sweden with its 75% top marginal tax bracket -- it offsets a tax bite that might otherwise dissuade foreign executives from taking up posts there.    But while multinationals see tax equalization as a useful incentive, the Swedish authorities view it more as a tax dodge. When they discovered the practice five years ago during a corporate-tax audit of the books at Shell, they immediately brought the company to court.    Empowered by the courts, they calculated backward: How much money would an employee have had to earn in Sweden before taxes to take home his guaranteed after-tax income? With Sweden's stiff tax brackets, the sums are astronomical.    In the Shell case, for example, the expatriate refinery worker was paid a 1982 salary of 199,000 Swedish kronor (about $34,000). Sweden's Supreme Tax Court ruled that he would have to pay taxes on a theoretical gross salary of 823,000 (about $140,000) -- or four times his actual income. In addition, the court found that Shell should have known that its tax-equalization plan required the company to pay higher taxes, and it assessed an additional 40% penalty on the company.    Accountants and tax lawyers say other countries ranging from the U.S. to Thailand have imposed limited policies for treating tax subsidization by employers. But, says Stephan Tolstoy, a senior partner at Price Waterhouse in Stockholm, with Swedish tax rates, &quot;the effects are absolutely horrendous.&quot;    The Shell ruling came out in March 1987. And though many non-Swedish companies knew the case was in the courts, the implications of its conclusion stunned some executives. &quot;It's like paying tax on tax,&quot; says a foreign banker in Stockholm. &quot;You're willing to cover taxes of three-quarters of an employee's salary . . . but you don't want to have to pay four or five times as much.&quot;    Many are refusing to. With the Shell case settled, says Robert L. Gilbert, the U.S. managing director of Manufacturers Hanover Bank Sverige, the Swedish merchant-banking subsidiary of Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., his bank is hurrying to reduce and eventually eliminate its expatriate staff, which has already been cut in half to three.    Other U.S. companies have avoided foreign talent altogether. IBM Svenska AB, a unit of International Business Machines Corp. of the U.S., has nearly 4,400 employees. But it has no expatriate employees and no plans to bring any in, says Managing Director Carl-Hugo Bluhme, who is Swedish.    Still other companies are looking for ways around the tax law (though lawyers warn that such efforts carry a legal risk). Some require expatriates to cover their own tax obligations during their stay here and reimburse them with a &quot;bonus&quot; after they leave the country. Other companies help employees cover their taxes with interest-free loans that are written off once the employees depart. One British company even kept an expatriate manager living in a Stockholm hotel for six months to avoid having him classified as a resident.    One company that has decided to pull out for the time being and rethink its position in Sweden is Dow Jones andamp; Co., the publisher of this newspaper. The Wall Street Journal/Europe will close its news bureau, while AP-Dow Jones News Service, a joint venture with the Associated Press, will relocate its U.S. reporter.    The tax troubles have taken a toll on Sweden's small expatriate population, estimated to number a few thousand at most. (Tens of thousands of other foreigners live here, but most are permanent residents and have come either as the spouses of Swedes or as emigres.)    Gunnar Rasmussen, the president of Stockholm's American Club, says tax troubles in the past decade have halved the number of U.S. expatriates in the organization to about 30 now. In the old days, he says, expatriates would organize golf outings, bowling tournaments or trips to the archipelago surrounding Stockholm. &quot;That doesn't happen anymore,&quot; says Mr. Rasmussen, a retired airline representative. &quot;There aren't enough people.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
