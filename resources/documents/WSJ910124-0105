The fact is, nobody, not governmentregulators, securities analysts or the bank's own management,can determine whether an institution is &quot;safe.&quot; How then canthe public, equipped with inadequate and incompletestatements of a bank, make an assessment as to its soundness?   Federal deposit insurance has provided depositors with away around inadequate disclosure by banks and the fact thatwe can't all be bank analysts. The pact with the devil (FDIC)has worked so far. Without banks and deposit insurance thepublic would be subjected to more risk and loss of itssavings.</LP><TEXT>   David Gunter   Tucson, Ariz.</TEXT></DOC>
