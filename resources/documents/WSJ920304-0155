The impasse in Taiwan caused the U.S. team to cancel aplanned trip to Japan to negotiate a similar extension. TheTaiwan talks were the third round held since the Dec. 31expiration of a five-year bilateral arrangement limitingTaiwan's machinetool exports to 1981 levels.</LP><TEXT>   Negotiators for both sides said they made more progressthan in the previous talks over the &quot;voluntary restraintagreement,&quot; but they agreed it was necessary to consult withtheir governments before meeting again. The next round oftalks hasn't been scheduled.   The U.S. machine-tool industry, which says it ishard-pressed by imports, had sought to have the restrictionson Taiwanese and Japanese exports extended by another fiveyears. But President Bush in December decided to extend therestrictions for only two years. The decision was basedlargely on Defense Department assertions that the U.S. mustprotect domestic makers of sophisticated machines needed tomake advanced weapons. Continued restrictions were opposed byseveral U.S. agencies, including the Office of the U.S. TradeRepresentative and the president's Council of EconomicAdvisers.   Taiwan, which has resisted continued restrictions, feelsthat it has been unfairly singled out, and notes that itsexports to the U.S. are much smaller than Japan's. Itsofficials also contend that while Taiwan's exports werecurtailed, Germany, Switzerland, Britain and China tookadvantage of the situation and rapidly increased their salesto the U.S.   Last year, Taiwan exported $26 million in the threecategories of computer-controlled machine tools that the U.S.wants to continue restricting. Taiwanese officials say thatamounts to only 3% of the U.S. market. Japanese exports tothe U.S. of the same products totaled more than $500 millionin 1990, Tokyo officials say.   In Tokyo, officials at the Ministry of International Tradeand Industry have said that they are agreeable to thetwo-year extension proposed by the U.S.</TEXT></DOC>
