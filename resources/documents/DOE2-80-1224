These surveysassess whether the operation of nuclear-powered warships, during construction,maintenance, overhaul, or refueling, have created elevated levels ofradioactivity. The surveys emphasize sampling those areas and pathwaysthat could expose the public. In 1984, NAVSEA requested that EPA surveyall active facilities servicing nuclear-powered warships over the nextthree years. This report contains the results of surveys conducted atNorfolk Naval Shipyard, Norfolk Naval Station and Newport News Shipbuildingduring the period July 28 to August 1, 1986. Some of these same areaswere previously surveyed by EERF personnel (at that time US Public HealthService) in January 1968. 1 ref., 4 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
