Well, maybe the Soviets will once again prove that theGipper was crazy like a fox.   At the recent Washington summit, the Soviet Union for thefirst time agreed to talk about &quot;the relationship betweenstrategic offensive and defensive arms.&quot; Those talks wouldinclude &quot;reductions in strategic offensive arms anddevelopment of new technologies,&quot; according to a jointU.S.-Soviet statement. This may not sound like much, butseveral U.S. officials think it's a conceptual breakthrough.The Soviets wanted the U.S. to commit to arms control beyondSTART-I, and in return the Soviets finally agreed to talkabout strategic defense outside the narrow confines of the1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty.</LP><TEXT>   In other words, &quot;new thinking&quot; continues to spread to theanimist religion of nuclear deterrence. For years that faithhas said that defending against nuclear weapons is heresy;only &quot;offensive&quot; systems can keep the peace by threatening toblow up everyone equally. Apart from its moral problems, thatdoctrine has suffered under the development of advanced newtechnology, symbolized by the U.S. SDI program. Now even manySoviets are challenging that orthodoxy.   Keith Payne, president of the National Institute forPublic Policy, has been keeping track of a remarkable newstrategic debate in the Soviet Union. Freed by glasnost,strategists are emerging who think the U.S.S.R. needs its ownSDI.   In the December 1989 issue of Soviet Military Review,Mikhail Aleksandrov of the Soviet Foreign Ministry says thatanti-nuclear defenses &quot;may, far from leading todestabilization, result in a better model of strategicstability than the one we have.&quot; Ronald Reagan liked to makethe same point.   In March 1989, another Foreign Ministry official, EdnanAgayev, even questioned the value of the ABM Treaty. Hewrote, &quot;in order to get to the truth it is necessary to calleverything in question. And hasn't the present `offensivedeterrence' been long ripe for that? The only moderndeterrence is defensive.&quot;   Even the Soviet military has joined the debate. In theMarch 23, 1990, issue of Sovetskaya Rossiya, Maj. Gen. V.Belous writes, &quot;We should hardly deny the possibility ofreasonable compromises in the future and development ofdefenses for U.S. and U.S.S.R. territory against accidentalmissile launches or blackmail attempts and threats made bythird countries.&quot; General Belous knows that missiles fromIraq or some future Republic of Armenia could reach Moscowlong before they'll have the range to hit Manhattan. (DefenseSecretary Cheney said Monday that by the year 2000, 15countries will produce ballistic missiles, including Iraq,Iran, Syria, Libya and North Korea.)   This &quot;new thinking&quot; is hardly a consensus yet, and it'spossible to make too much of one summit statement. OfficialSoviet negotiators still say they won't accept a U.S. spacedefense. But negotiators are always the last to know. Moreopen minds in Moscow seem to understand that the technologyis moving, that they've so far failed to kill SDI, and so whynot cooperate so that both sides can have defenses?   It may also be that the Soviets pay more attention toSDI's technical progress than the Washington press corpsdoes. The pace of SDI tests is picking up, with bofforesults. Two SDI satellites are currently in orbit testinglasers in the atmosphere and bouncing them off mirrors inspace and back to Hawaii. In January, the HEDI ground-to-airmissile interceptor made its first successful test. In April,a laser radar proved that it could distinguish a decoy from areal missile in microseconds.   Sometime this summer, the Pentagon plans its first flighttest of a &quot;brilliant pebble,&quot; the small interceptor thatmight someday be deployed by the hundreds in space. Every newdevelopment in electronics -- Hitachi just announced aprototype computer chip with 64 million bits -- makes iteasier for SDI scientists to pack more computing power onto apebble-like satellite for less money. Because they'd float inearth orbit, pebbles could also just as easily protect theSoviet Union as the U.S.   The enemy of this progress now is old thinking in both theU.S. and U.S.S.R. Secretary Cheney had to fight colleagues(Brent Scowcroft) to get the U.S. even to argue at the summitfor the new defense language. Many in Congress want to raidSDI to build more tanks and planes, though research spendingis far more useful in peacetime. Old thinking dies hard, buton SDI its days are numbered.</TEXT></DOC>
