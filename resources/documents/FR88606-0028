The 1987 Act: (1) Requires the merger or consolidation ofthe Federal land banks and Federal intermediate credit banks in each district;(2) requires a stockholder vote on the merger or consolidation of Federalland bank associations and production credit associations that share substantiallythe same geographical territory; (3) mandates stockholder votes on a proposalto consolidate the banks for cooperatives, and on a proposal to consolidatethe twelve Farm Credit districts into no less than six banks; (4) providesfor the petitioning by association stockholders to reconsider associationmergers completed between December 23, 1985 and January 6, 1988, or toseek a transfer of territory to an adjoining district; (5) permits themerger or consolidation of banks in a district into one bank.The 1987 Act requires the FCA to issue regulations to implement the newor amended reorganization authorities contained in the Act. To preparefor the issuance of proposed regulations, the FCA published an AdvanceNotice of Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM) on February 16, 1988, (53 FR 4416)requesting comment on the implementation of the new reorganization authoritiesof System institutions and on the election of individuals to the boardsof directors of the newly established or authorized System institutions.The comment period closed March 1, 1988.Comments were received from the Farm Credit Corporation of America (FCCA)on behalf of the 37 Farm Credit banks, several individual Farm Credit banks,a number of production credit associations and Federal land bank associations,a west coast growers' cooperative, and the counsel for the Special Committeeon Bank for Cooperatives Structure (established in accordance with section413 of the 1987 Act). All of the comments were analyzed and taken intoconsideration in the development of the proposed regulations.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Election of Directors and Candidate Disclosure Statements</ITAG>The FCA received comments from the FCCA and three Farm Credit banks andassociations regarding the need for regulations addressing the electionsof the board of directors of a consolidated bank for cooperatives and theboard of directors of an Agricultural Credit Bank, created by merger ofa Farm Credit Bank and a bank for cooperatives. A majority of the respondentsindicated that regulations governing the nomination and elections of boardsof directors were not needed.The 1987 Act deleted Farm Credit Act of 1971, as amended (1971 Act) sections5.1 through 5.6 which governed the nomination and election of Farm CreditDistrict Boards in connection with the creation of a separate board foreach bank. The deletion of these sections also eliminated the FCA's responsibilityand authority to conduct polls for the nomination and election of individualsto district and association boards of directors. The 1987 Act providedthat policies governing the nomination and election of directors shouldbe detailed in the bylaws of the institutions, which would be subject tothe FCA's regulation. In addition, new sections 7.1 and 3.21 require theFCA to regulate the conduct of elections for the boards of AgriculturalCredit Banks, formed by the merger of a Farm Credit Bank and bank for cooperatives,and elections for the board of a consolidated bank for cooperatives.In accordance with these general and specific authorities, the FCA hasproposed regulations that would establish fundamental eligibility requirementsfor membership on all bank and association boards based on safety and soundnessconsiderations, and require each bank and association to adopt policiesand procedures to ensure impartiality, confidentiality, and security inthe election of directors.The proposed regulation at 12 CFR 611.310 is based in part on provisionspreviously contained in sections 5.1 to 5.6 of the 1971 Act and would providefor a one-year period between service by any person as director and employeeof any bank or association in order to maintain clear and separate accountabilityof the policy and management functions and require the termination of serviceof a bank or association director when continued service is clearly incompatiblewith the integrity and reputation of the institution.The proposed regulation at 12 CFR 611.320 would incorporate the provisionsof 12 CFR 612.2200 which prohibit participation in director elections bybank and association employees and would provide for equal access to bankor association property, facilities, and resources to all declared candidates,if such access is provided to one candidate. Also, the regulation wouldprovide for distribution or mailing of candidate biographical informationin a standard format.New section 4.20 of the 1971 Act prohibits the use of signed ballots inelections for directors of System institutions. The proposed regulationat 12 CFR 611.330 would address this new prohibition by requiring bankand association policies and procedures to protect the confidentialityof stockholders' identity and votes. The proposed regulation contains anexception to this general requirement to enable institutions to identifythe voting strength of a ballot or proxy when that type of voting is providedfor in the bylaws or required in the Act. These records would be availablefor review by the FCA through its examination authorities.Proposed regulations at 12 CFR 620.30, 620.31, 620.32 establish disclosurerequirements for bank director candidates consistent with the disclosurerequirements for association director candidates. To accommodate the differencesbetween bank and association election scheduling, the proposed regulationsfor banks do not require these disclosures to be provided in connectionwith an annual meeting, as is the case for associations. The proposed regulationswould require banks to adopt policies and procedures to assure that a disclosurestatement is prepared by each candidate for bank director and require suchstatements to be mailed with the balloting materials.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Transfers of Lending Authorities</ITAG>New section 7.6 of the 1971 Act provides for the transfer of lending authoritiesfrom a Federal land bank (or a merged bank having a Federal land bank asone of its constituents) to the Federal land bank associations in its district.This section also contains a provision which provides for the automatictransfer of direct lending authority from a Federal land bank to any associationin the district created by the merger of a Federal land bank associationand a production credit association.The FCA received comments from the FCCA and seven Farm Credit banks andassociations regarding the transfer of lending authorities. Six of therespondents indicated that a transfer should not be approved if the needfor financial assistance was thereby increased. Several commentators expresseda concern that the flexibility for staggered or phased-in transfers shouldbe maintained and that technical assistance agreements between the bankand associations should be allowed. A majority of respondents indicatedthat regulations are needed to ensure the safe and sound delivery of creditto the member-borrowers of the banks and associations involved in assignmentsor transfers of lending authorities.The proposed regulations at 12 CFR 611.500 through 611.525 would establishthe manner in which the statutorily required approvals of stockholders,affiliated banks, and the FCA are obtained in connection with a transferof lending authority. The regulations specify the procedures and disclosuresrequirements for transfers of lending authorities that are similar to theregulations for other association disclosures requiring stockholder vote.To preserve the totality of circumstances involved in any proposed transfer,the regulations do not contain specific eligibility criteria for approval,such as minimum capital ratios. The regulations provide for an administrativereview by the FCA, which would evaluate the proposed assignment or transferfrom a safety and soundness standpoint. Under the regulations FCA coulddeny a request for cause provided that the reasons for denial are fullyexplained.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Special Reconsideration of Mergers</ITAG>The FCA received comments from the FCCA and six banks and associationsregarding new section 7.9 of the 1971 Act which provides for the reconsiderationand possible dissolution of mergers that occurred after December 23, 1985,but before January 5, 1988. Half of the respondents stated that there wasa need for regulations that protected the rights and interests of the stockholdersof each association involved in any reorganization. A majority of the respondents believed that the FCA should not approvea reorganization which resulted in associations that would be clearly nonviableor would require additional financial assistance from the System. Othercommentators supported the need for regulations to ensure the safety andsoundness of any institution that may result from a reorganization andthat would require the institution to meet minimum capital adequacy standards.Several respondents stated that full disclosure similar to that requiredfor association mergers, should be required in the petition process sothat stockholders would have a balanced presentation of the relevant information.One respondent suggested that the regulations should require institutionsto prepare financial statements that demonstrate how the association wouldhave performed if the merger had not taken place. Another respondent believedthat the association board should have the right to include its opinionon the reorganization in the disclosure materials. Several parties commentedthat the FCA should establish procedures that would minimize the potentiallydisruptive impact that multiple votes on different petitions could haveon the association and its member-borrowers during this process. One respondentstated that the territorial rights of an association choosing to withdrawshould be limited to those it held before the merger, whereas a secondrespondent believed that the regulations should be flexible on this pointso that the desired restructuring could occur with only one, rather thanmultiple, stockholder votes. Two respondents expressed the need for regulatoryguidance on the distribution of assets and liabilities on a fair and equitablebasis should an association be restructured. The proposed regulations at 12 CFR 611.1190 through 611.1198 set forththe procedures for petitions, disclosures, and stockholder votes duringthe one-year reconsideration period. The regulations are not applicableto any mergers or consolidations implemented prior to December 23, 1985,or after January 5, 1988. To minimize the disruptive effect that repeated or multiple petitions couldhave on the association and stockholders and ensure that a reorganizationachieves the results intended by the stockholders, the regulations providefor a petition process which expands the options available to stockholdersand directors. Stockholders may petition to either withdraw from the existingassociation or to reorganize the entire association into two or more separateassociations which may or may not have territory similar to that held bypredecessor associations. The regulations also authorize an associationboard of directors to initiate, by board resolution, a complete reorganizationof an association and submit it to stockholders for approval. The proposed regulations specify the types of disclosures that must beprovided in an information statement prior to a vote on a petition or boardresolution. If the reorganization involves the entire association, an affirmativevote of the majority of the association's stockholders is needed beforethe reorganization can occur. The disclosure requirements are similar tothose for association mergers and include a plan of reorganization forany association created by withdrawal or reorganization as well as proforma financial statements for the same. The information statement mustalso include a discussion of the likelihood that the associations involvedwould need financial assistance during their first three years of operations.The proposed regulations provide for the verification of signatures onthe petition by the association and require that the petitions or boardresolutions and the accompanying disclosure materials be submitted to theFCA for approval. The FCA could deny approval of a petition or board resolutionprovided that the reasons for denial are fully explained. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Merger and Reorganization Proposals Required by the 1987 Act</ITAG>The FCA received comments from the FCCA and one Farm Credit district regardingsection 412 of the 1987 Act which provides for the establishment of theSpecial Committee for the consolidation of Farm Credit districts. The FCABoard has addressed these regulations in a separate <T4>Federal Register </T4>document which contains interim rules relatingto the Special Committee.The proposed regulations at 12 CFR 611.1145 set forth requirements governingthe development of proposals for the merger of certain Federal land bankassociations and production credit associations and timetables for thesubmission of merger proposals to the affiliated banks and to the FCA.The proposed regulations clarify the meaning of ``substantially the same''as used in section 411 of the 1987 Act by requiring merger proposals forthe creation of agricultural credit associations to be developed in instancesin which 90 percent or more of the chartered territory of a productioncredit association overlaps with 90 percent or more of the chartered territoryof a Federal land bank association. The proposed regulations provide thatthe merger proposals shall be submitted to the affiliated banks no laterthan 60 days following the creation of the Farm Credit Bank and to theFCA no more than 30 days later. In addition, the proposed regulations specifythat merger proposals must comply with the provisions of Subpart G of Part611 relating to contents of the proposal, required information statements,Farm Credit Administration approval, and stockholder votes.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Other Changes to Current Merger Regulations.</ITAG>The FCA Board adopted other proposed regulations and amendments to currentregulations that implement the provisions of sections 7.0 and 7.12 of the1971 Act which provide for the merger of banks operating under the sameor different titles of the 1971 Act. The proposed amendments at 12 CFR611.1000 and 611.1010 establish the general authority for changes to bankcharters and the procedures for amending bank charters. Proposed regulationsat andSection; 611.1020 set forth the requirements for mergers and consolidationsof banks and incorporate the requirements of andSection;andSection; 611.1122and 611.1123 relating to mergers of associations, that are applicable tobank mergers. Proposed regulations at andSection; 611.1030 would providefor association representation on the board of directors of an AgriculturalCredit Bank created by the consolidation of a Farm Credit Bank and a bankfor cooperatives.The proposed amendments to andSection;andSection; 611.1122(g) and 611.1123(a)implement the provisions of section 7.9 of the 1971 Act, by requiring adelay in the implementation of any voluntary bank or association mergerwhich provides the stockholders with the opportunity to reconsider theirapproval. Upon the filing of a reconsideration petition by 15 percent ormore of the stockholders of any one bank or association that is a partyto a merger, there would be a new stockholder vote on the merger.Section 433 of the 1987 Act permits the stockholders of a Federal landbank association or production credit association whose chartered territoryadjoins the territory of another district to petition the FCA to incorporatethe petitioning association into the adjoining district. The FCA has decidednot to promulgate regulations governing this process because the statutoryprovisions are clear and the FCA's existing regulations at 12 CFR 611.1124adequately address the requirements for transfers of territory.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Parts 611, 612, 618, and 620</ITAG>Accounting, Agriculture, Archives and records, Banks, banking, Conflictof interests, Insurance, Organizations and functions (Government agencies),Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Rural areas, Technical assistance.For the reasons stated in the preamble, Parts 611, 612, 618, and Part 620of Chapter VI, Title 12, of the Code of Federal Regulations are proposedto be amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 611_ORGANIZATION</ITAG>1.
