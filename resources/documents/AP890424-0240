(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The ritual slayings of 15 people by adrug-smuggling ring in northern Mexico underscore the need forpolice to be trained to recognize the signs of all kinds of occultcrime, according to a growing group of ``cult cops.''   While the Matamoros slayings apparently had nothing to do withdevil worship, satanism has become a hot topic in law enforcementcircles.   Law enforcement officials nationwide note an increase in reportsof satanic grafitti, animal mutilations and signs that occultrituals have taken place. But some say the threat is beingexaggerated.   Nonetheless, a seminar on satanism and crime sponsored by theConnecticut State Police last month attracted more than 300 policeofficers from all over New England who wanted to learn how todistinguish serious satanists from teen-age pranksters and how torespond to each.   Sober law enforcement journals are running articles describing a``satanic threat'' and telling police how to spot evidence at crimescenes that might be overlooked by those unfamiliar with cultpractices.   Among the new breed of cult cops, sometimes derided as``ghostbusters'' by their colleagues, is Detective Sgt. Alan L.Alves of Freetown. Alves has never made an arrest for a sataniccrime and has found no evidence of human sacrifices. But he'sconvinced such ritual murders are occurring.   ``The organized satanists leave absolutely no evidence,'' Alvessays. ``They're killing. That's what they believe in. They have tomake sacrifices. They're killing babies.''   The Matamoros killings were not related to satanism, accordingto Thomas Wedge, a former Union, Ohio, deputy sheriff and theauthor of ``The Satan Hunter.'' Wedge makes his living lecturingabout satanism, mainly to law enforcement groups.   Wedge, reached in Baton Rouge, La., where he was conducting aseminar for the state police, said the Matamoros killers werepracticing a black magic version of brujeria, an Afro-Caribbeanreligion.   ``This is not an isolated case by any means,'' he said, addingthat he knows of at least one other ritual killing by drug dealers.   Wedge said brujeria is practiced by many Cuban criminals whocame to the United States on the Mariel boat lift.   Other experts dispute Wedge's contention that brujeria was toblame.   Among them is Robert D. Hicks, a criminal justice analyst forthe state of Virginia, and a former police officer in Tucson,Ariz., where he had firsthand experience with drug smugglers andbrujeria, which gets its name from the Spanish word for witch _brujo.   Brujo, who are found in the Caribbean, Mexico and in Hispaniccommunities all over the United States, are witch doctors or wisemen who may also practice some magic, Hicks says, but the vastmajority are peaceful and law-abiding.   Hicks says the Matamoros killers may have drawn on elements ofthe religion to promise their followers magical immunity tobullets. Or, the cult leaders, including Alfonso de JesusConstanzo, a Cuban-American, may have just had an appetite forblood and wanted to terrorize competitors and police.   ``In northern Mexico, drug trafficking is intenselycompetitive,'' Hicks says. ``Nobody knows at the moment ifConstanzo actually has some deep, abiding faith that pushed him tocommit these crimes, or if he was just a slick operator who made itup as he went along.''   Hicks, who is writing a book critical of the ``satanism scare''in law enforcement circles, says the real danger is that police maybegin trampling on the religious freedoms of those who practicenon-Christian beliefs, even though there is no evidence ofcriminality.   The FBI's chief expert on cult crime, Kenneth V. Lanning, andother law enforcement officials contacted around the country saidthere is no solid evidence that crimes committed by satanworshipers are on the increase in America.   ``I question whether there is a true increase,'' says Lanning,supervisory special agent at the FBI's behavioral sciences unit inQuantico, Va., who is frequently contacted by local officialsseeking help on cases with cult overtones.   But Wedge insists satanists have been thriving on policeignorance and disbelief.   ``It doesn't really matter what you or I believe,'' Wedge says.``It's what they believe that's dangerous.''   Connecticut state police have noticed an increase in the numberof phone callers reporting satanic activity, particularly aroundHalloween.   ``We've only had incidents of things that could be classified asa bona fide satanic ritual, and those things did not involve anycriminal acts except minor things like criminal trespass or illegalbonfires,'' says Sgt. Scott O'Mara.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
