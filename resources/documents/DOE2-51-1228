<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-51-1228 </DOCNO><TEXT>In this paper, the experimental procedures are presented for carburizingand boronizing the 20 steel surface using a CW CO{sub 2} laser with anoutput power of 500--2000 W modulated CW. We also give a comprehensiveanalysis about the phase structure, the phase morphology, the distributionprofile of the hardness and the resistance to abrasion of the sampleafter laser treatment. The experimental results indicate that the microstructure,the mechanical properties and the chemical composition in the surfacelayer of material will basically change. Furthermore, a preliminary discussionof the strengthening mechanism of the penetrating element by laser irradiationis also presented.</TEXT></DOC>
