Mr. Bouchard told the House of Commons that the U.S.Senate's approval Tuesday of a comprehensive clean-air bill&quot;moves us much closer to the opening of formal negotiations&quot;for a U.S.-Canada air quality agreement.</LP><TEXT>   He said U.S. and Canadian officials have met frequently inthe past year to discuss the framework and &quot;essentialdetails&quot; of such an agreement. He predicted formalnegotiations with the U.S. will begin soon and &quot;we hope thatit will be possible to conclude an agreement by the fall.&quot;   The acid rain issue has been the Canadian government'sbiggest grievance with the U.S. for much of the past decade.Canada blames wind-carried pollution from the U.S. for halfof the acid rain that falls on Canada. Acid rain occurs whengases from smokestacks and other sources combine withmoisture in the air and fall to the ground, often hundreds ofmiles from the pollution source.   The Canadian government claims that acid rain hasdestroyed fish and other life in at least 14,000 EasternCanadian lakes. The government says an additional 300,000lakes are damaged or vulnerable.   The Canadian government has reached agreements with thecountry's seven Eastern-most provinces requiring a 50%reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by 1994. Sulfurdioxide, which is emitted by power plants, smelters and othersources, is ranked as the biggest single cause of acid rain.   Prime Minister Brian Mulroney and President Bush areexpected to discuss the acid rain issue when they meet inToronto on Tuesday. Soon after Mr. Bush was elected, heassured Mr. Mulroney that the U.S. administration would takeconcrete action on acid rain.   The proposed agreement with the U.S. would set targets forreducing acid gas emissions. The Canadian government saysthat sulfur dioxide emissions in Eastern Canada are alreadydown 40% from their 1980 level.   Wind-carried Canadian pollution accounts for 10% to 25% ofthe acid rain that falls in the Northeastern U.S., Canadianofficials estimate.   The Canadian government and the Carter administrationagreed in 1979 to negotiate an accord to controltrans-boundary air pollution. But Ottawa wasn't able tonegotiate such a pact with the Reagan administration.</TEXT></DOC>
