The two banks closed yesterday were First National Bank of Tipton, Tipton, Okla., which had assets of $8.2 million, and First National Bank of Hammon, Hammon, Okla., which had assets of $6 million. Both banks were to reopen today as branches of other institutions.    The Tipton bank's office is to become a branch of First National Bank in Altus, Altus, Okla. The failed bank held $7.1 million in 1,350 deposit accounts, including $2,000 in two accounts that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit of $100,000 for each depositor.    The Hammon bank's office is to be a branch of American National Bank, Elk City, Okla. The failed bank held deposits of $5.5 million in 776 accounts, including $2,000 in one account that exceeded the federal deposit insurance limit.    Owners of the uninsured deposits held by both banks will share proportionately with the FDIC in the proceeds from the sale of the banks' assets.    A total of 25 Oklahoma banks have failed this year. </TEXT></DOC>
