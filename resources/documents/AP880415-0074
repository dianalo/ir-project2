In two hours of talks in the Great Hall of the People, Mrs.Aquino and Li discussed Cambodia, Afghanistan, disarmament andU.S.-Soviet relations, the official Xinhua News Agency said.   Mrs. Aquino also stressed that ``we stick to the policy ofnon-interference in each other's internal affairs.'' China hasassured Manila that it no longer aids communist insurgents in thePhilippines. Mrs. Aquino said that the People's Republic is thesole legal government representing China.   It was not known whether the two spoke about trade issues. ThePhilippines has sought a reduction in China's surplus in tradebetween the two countries.   Li, who was formally confirmed as premier at the just-concludedsession of China's legislature, the National People's Congress,greeted Mrs. Aquino in English and said: ``Glad to meet you.Welcome to Peking.''   Yang noted that Chinese-Philippine contacts date back forcenturies and that ``the Chinese and Filipinos are relatives aswell as friends. We hope more and more Philippine friends willvisit China,'' Xinhua reported.   The ancestors of Mrs. Aquino, like those of many Filipinos, camefrom China. On her first day in China Thursday, Mrs. Aquino visitedthe home of maternal great-grandfather in southern Fujian province.   Mrs. Aquino said the warm reception she received in the villageof Hongjian ``was a reflection of the friendly feelings of theChinese people for the Philippine people.''   Li and Yang accepted an invitation from Mrs. Aquino to visit thePhilippines, Xinhua said. No date was set.   Yang presided over welcoming ceremonies earlier outside the hall.   The new president, an 81-year-old general, accompanied Mrs.Aquino on a review of a People's Liberation Army honor guard and300 children dancing and waving bouquets. She received a 21-gunsalute from cannons on Tiananmen Square.   Mrs. Aquino and Li spoke about Cambodia. Both Asian nationssupport the rebels in their 9-year-old war against Vietnamesetroops in Cambodia.   Mrs. Aquino, accompanied by two of her daughters, planned anafternoon visit to the Forbidden City, home in the past to theChinese imperial family, and the Great Wall.   Her three-day trip to China is her first abroad since November1986, and was called risky by opposition leaders because of fearsof a coup following the escape of renegade military officerGregorio Honasan, who led an attempted takeover last August.   The military was put on full alert on the eve of the visit.   Philippine presidential spokesman Teodoro Benigno said Thursdaythat Honasan was not capable of mounting a serious threat to thegovernment.   Mrs. Aquino was swept to power in February 1986 after acivilian-military coup ousted President Ferdinand Marcos. Marcoslives in exile in Hawaii.</TEXT></DOC>
