Thecourt ruled in March that Genetics's patent was invalidbecause it failed to show how to make the drug with theclaimed degree of purity.   The court upheld Amgen's claim to the technology necessaryto produce recombinant erythropoietin, thus granting whatappears to be a monopoly over domestic sales to kidneydialysis patients.   The decision was a blow to Genetics, which had beencounting on revenue both from royalties on U.S. sales andfrom manufacturing the drug in the U.S. for European sales.   Analysts said the Supreme Court in recent years has rarelyconsented to review patent cases.</TEXT></DOC>
