These include the Atlantic Wind Test Site, the 230-kW turbinein the Magdalen Islands, and Project Aquilo, a 500-kW vertical axis machine.The position of the electric utilities toward connection with wind powerproducers is discussed, and found to vary according to the policies ofprovincial governments. Some of those provincial governments are alsoinvolved in wind energy research or development; so is the Canadian windpower industry, to a relatively modest extent. Some programs of interestto wind energy development are found in the federal Department of Energy,Mines, and Resources; these include the Conservation and Renewable EnergyDemonstration Agreement, and the Remote Communities Demonstration Program.Wind power installations are already economic in areas where there isa high wind regime, high fuel costs and reasonable turbine cost.</TEXT></DOC>
