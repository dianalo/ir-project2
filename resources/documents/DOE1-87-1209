Thermal ignition is the spontaneous explosion that occursafter a chemical induction period. The study emphasizes the influenceof gas dynamic disturbances on the induction time and the presence oflocal ignition centers in the bulk mixture. The study contains threemajor elements. First, chemical kinetics computations are used to quantifythe influence of disturbances on the induction times for homogeneousmixtures at constant volume. The constant-volume approximation is thenreplaced by a gas dynamic constraint to model ignition of an exothermiccenter. Finally, a one-dimensional model for an inert gas with energydeposition is developed to simulate the gas dynamics of the explosion.</TEXT></DOC>
