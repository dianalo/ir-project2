JeffersonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/22/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> WEITENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM)RETAILING (RET) </IN><TEXT>   Wherehouse Entertainment Inc., attempting to thwart a hostile takeover bid by Shamrock Holdings Inc., said it agreed to be acquired by a company formed by the closely held investment firm of Adler andamp; Shaykin Inc. for about $143 million.    Under terms of the agreement, Adler andamp; Shaykin would pay $14 a share for Wherehouse's 8,433,539 common shares outstanding. In addition, Wherehouse has debt that could be converted into about 1.8 million common shares.    New York-based Adler andamp; Shaykin specializes in management-led leveraged buyouts, and earlier this year it arranged a buy-out of Joy Manufacturing Co. to help that company block a takeover attempt by Pullman-Peabody Co.    An attorney for Wherehouse, a Torrance, Calif., specialty retailer of home entertainment and information software, said that while Wherehouse management would be retained after the buy-out, they aren't participating in the actual purchase.    In an apparent last-minute attempt to salvage its bid for Wherehouse, Shamrock informed the company Sunday that it was prepared to sweeten its offer for the Wherehouse shares it doesn't hold to $13.75 a share from $12, Wherehouse said. After receiving the proposal from Shamrock, Wherehouse directors voted unanimously Sunday evening to accept Adler andamp; Shaykin's bid and reject Shamrock's offer.    The announcement sent Wherehouse's stock price soaring $2.50 in American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday to close at $13.625 a share.    A spokesman for Burbank, Calif.-based Shamrock declined comment on Wherehouse's action. Shamrock, the closely held holding company of the Roy E. Disney family, holds 867,700 Wherehouse shares, or about a 10.3% stake. Shamrock would receive about $12.1 million if it tenders its shares under the Adler andamp; Shaykin offer.    As previously reported, Shamrock initially made a $14.25 a share bid for Wherehouse, then later lowered the offer to $12 a share after the Oct. 19 stock market crash. Wherehouse directors rejected those bids.    Adler andamp; Shaykin has received financing commitments from Chemical New York Corp. and Equitable Capital Management Corp., and Merrill Lynch Capital Markets is serving as its financial adviser for the buy-out, which will be completed by WEI Holdings Inc., the company formed by Adler andamp; Shaykin.    In a leveraged buy-out, a small group of investors acquires a company largely with borrowed funds, which it later repays with income from the acquired company's operations or a sale of its assets.    Wherehouse said it agreed to pay Adler andamp; Shaykin's fees and expenses, and has advanced $1 million to the firm. If the acquisition is terminated under certain circumstances, Wherehouse will pay a $2.8 million breakup fee, and Adler andamp; Shaykin will have an option to buy 1.7 million Wherehouse shares, or a 20% stake, for $12 a share. </TEXT></DOC>
