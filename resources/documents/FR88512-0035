It has been determined by an environmentalevaluation that this action will have no significant impact on the qualityof the human environment. Therefore, neither an Environmental Assessmentnor an Environmental Impact Statement is needed.<ITAG tagnum="84">Determination of Levels of Price Support</ITAG>Price support is required to be made available for each crop of a kindof tobacco for which marketing quotas are in effect or for which marketingquotas have not been disapproved by producers. With respect to the 1988crop of the six kinds of tobacco which are the subject of this notice,the respective maximum level of support is determined in accordance withsection 106 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended (the ``Act'').Section 106(f)(6)(A) of the Act provides that the level of support forthe 1988 crop of a kind of tobacco shall be the level in cents per poundat which the 1987 crop of such kind of tobacco was supported, plus or minus,respectively, the amount by which (i) the support level for the 1988 crop,as determined under section 106(b) of the Act, is greater or less than(ii) the support level for the 1987 crop, as determined under section 106(b)of the Act, as that difference may be adjusted by the Secretary under section106(d) of the Act if the support level under clause (i) is greater thanthe support level under clause (ii).Accordingly, under section 106(f)(6)(A) of the Act, the support level forthe 1988 crop of such kind of tobacco will be the 1987 level, adjustedby the difference between (plus or minus) the 1988 ``basic support level''and the 1987 ``basic support level''.In addition, section 106(f)(6)(B) of the Act provides that to the extentrequested by the board of directors of an association through which pricesupport is made available to producers (``producer association'') the Secretarymay reduce the support level determined under section 106(f)(6)(A) forany kind of tobacco (except flue-cured and burley) to more accurately reflectthe market value and improve the marketability of tobacco. Accordingly,the price support levels for a kind of tobacco which are set forth in thisnotice could be reduced if such a request is made.Additionally, section 106(f)(8)(A) of the Act provides that for the 1988crop of a kind of tobacco the support level shall be reduced by 1.4 percentof the level otherwise established. Any such reduction under this subsectionshall not be taken into consideration in determining the support levelfor the subsequent crop of tobacco. Also, section 106(f)(8)(B) providesthat in lieu of making any such reduction, the Secretary may impose assessmentson the producers and purchasers in an amount sufficient to realize a reductionin outlays equal to the amount that would have been achieved as a resultof the reduction required under section 106(f)(8)(A).The levels of price support for the 1987 crops of various kinds of tobacco,which were determined in accordance with section 106(f)(6)(A), are as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,7</C> <H1>Kind and type</H1><H1>Support (cents per pound)</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Virginia fire-cured, type 21<D>119.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">KY-TN fire-cured, types 22-23<D>123.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dark air-cured, types 35-36<D>105.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Virginia sun-cured, type 37<D>105.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cigar-filler and binder, types 42-44, 53-55<D>91.4</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Puerto Rican filler, type 46<D>74.7</D></ITAG></ITAG>Section 106(b) of the Act provides that the ``basic support level'' forany year is determined by multiplying the support level for the 1959 cropof such kind of tobacco by the ratio of the average of the index of pricespaid by farmers including wage rates, interest, and taxes (referred toas the ``parity index'') for the three previous calendar years to the averageindex of such prices paid by farmers, including wage rates, interest, andtaxes for the 1959 calendar year (298). For the 1988-crop year, the averageparity indexes for the three previous years are: 1985-1120; 1986-1096;and 1987-1115. The average of the parity indexes for these years is 1110and the ratio of the 1985-87 index to the 1959 index is 3.72. For the 1987-cropyear, the average parity indexes used to calculate the 1987 ``basic supportlevel'' were: 1984-1130; 1985-1120; 1986-1097. The ratio of the 1984-86index to the 1959 index equaled 3.74. Thus, the ``basic support level''for the 1987 and 1988 crops of the various kinds of tobaccos and the annualdecrease are as shown in the following table:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>4,L2,tp0,i1,s15,6,6,6</C> <H1>Kind and type</H1><H1>Basic support Level</H1><H2>1987</H2><H2>1988</H2><H1>Decrease in 1988 from 1987</H1><ITAG tagnum="27">Cents per pound</ITAG><R/><ITAG tagnum="1">Virginia fire-cured type 21<D>145.1</D><D>144.3</D><D>.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured types 22-23<D>145.1</D><D>144.3</D><D>.8</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dark air-cured, types 35-36<D>129.0</D><D>128.3</D><D>.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Virginia sun-cured, types 37 <D>129.0</D><D>128.3</D><D>.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cigar filler and binder, types 42-44, 54-55<D>107.0</D><D>106.4</D><D>.6</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Puerto Rican filler, type 46<D>111.1</D><D>110.5</D><D>.6</D></ITAG></ITAG>Section 106(d) of the Act provides that the Secretary of Agriculture mayreduce the level of support which would otherwise be established for anygrade of such kind of tobacco which the Secretary determines will likelybe in excess supply. In addition, the weighted average of the level ofsupport for all eligible grades of such tobacco must, after such reduction,reflect not less than 65 percent of the increase in the support level forsuch kind of tobacco which would otherwise be established under section106 of the Act if the support level is higher than the support level forthe preceding crop. Before any such reduction is made, the Secretary mustconsult with the associations handling price support loans and considerationmust be given to the supply and anticipated demand of such tobacco, includingthe effect of such reduction on other kinds of quota tobacco. In determiningwhether the supply of any grade of any kind of tobacco of a crop will beexcessive, the Secretary shall take into consideration the domestic supply,including domestic inventories, the amount of such tobacco pledged as securityfor price support loans, an anticiapted domestic and export demand, basedon the maturity, uniformity and stalk position of such tobacco. Since the1988 ``basic support level'' is below the 1987 ``basic support level'',section 106(d) is not applicable for the 1988 crop.As noted in the following table, the supplies of all these kinds of tobaccofor which price support is made available are currently at, or in excessof, he supply deemed adequate to meet domestic use and export needs. Asa result of these increased supplies of tobacco, the quantity of tobaccopledged as collateral for CCC price support loans remains ample to excessive.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>6,L2,tp0,i1,s150,10,10,10,10,9.1</C> <H1>Kind and type</H1><H1>1987/88 Production</H1><H1>1987/88 Total Supply</H1><H1>1987/88 Reserve Supply</H1><H1>1987-Crop CCC Loan Collateral</H1><H1>1987/88 CCC Loans as % of production</H1><ITAG tagnum="27">Million Pounds</ITAG><R/><ITAG tagnum="1">Virginia fire-cured, type 21<D>2.6</D><D>9.7</D><D>8.3</D><D>.3</D><D>11.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Kentucky-Tennessee fire-cured types, 22-23<D>23.3</D><D>119.4</D><D>116.7</D><D>4.5</D><D>19.3</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Dark air-cured types 35-36<D>7.0</D><D>55.7</D><D>54.9</D><D>1.1</D><D>15.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Virginia sun-cured, type 37<D>.1</D><D>1.1</D><D>1.0</D><D>(\1\)</D><D>22.7</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Cigar-filler, and binder, types 42-44, 53-55<D>7.9</D><D>61.5</D><D>63.8</D><D>(\1\)</D><D>0.5</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Puerto Rican filler, type 46<D>.2</D><D>5.3</D><D>\2\ 3.9</D><D>.2</D><D>100</D><F>\1\ Less than 50,000 pounds.</F><F>\2\ Three times annual disappearance past 3 marketing years.</F></ITAG></ITAG>Because of the oversupply situation for fire-cured (type 21), fire-cured(types 22-23), dark air-cured (types 35-36), Virginia sun-cured (type 37),Puerto Rican filler (type 46), and cigar-filler and binder (types 42-44;53-55) tobaccos, the 1988 support level for each kind consists of the 1987level of support decreased by the difference beween the 1988 ``basic supportlevel'' and the 1987 ``basic support level''.For the 1988 crops, the 1.4 percent decrease provided by section 106(f)(8)(A)of the Act would require reductions to the support level of 1.7 cents to1.0 cents per pound, depending on the kind of tobacco. Alternatively, theassessments for the various kinds of tobacco which would be required forthe 1988 crops to achieve the estimated budget reduction obtained fromthe support reduction range from 0.8 cents to 0.5 cents per pound.
