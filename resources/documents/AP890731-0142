(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An angry mob shouted obscenities at amental patient charged Monday in the fatal stabbing of a 9-year-oldgirl, and state officials tried to explain why he was able to walkaway from a state hospital.   David Peterson, 37, was being held on $750,000 bond after hisSuperior Court arraignment on murder and weapons charges in thedeath of Jessica Short of Wallingford.   The girl was stabbed to death in front of her mother and dozensof other people Friday at a street fair in Middletown. The stabbinghappened after Peterson slipped away from the Connecticut ValleyHospital, also in Middletown.   Two police sharpshooters perched on a neighboring rooftopprovided additional security Monday while Peterson, in handcuffsand leg shackles, was hustled in and out of court under heavy guard.   Peterson appeared at the five-minute hearing with a publicdefender, and he told Judge Robert Burns that he understood hisrights.   Burns ordered Peterson to undergo psychiatric evaluation todetermine whether he is competent to stand trial. He is due back incourt Aug. 14.   After the arraignment, between 35 and 40 people shoutingobscenities ran alongside the police car that took Peterson away.Peterson was to be confined to Whiting Forensic Institute, a statehospital for the criminally insane in Middletown.   He could face up to life in prison if convicted of murder.   State Mental Health Commissioner Michael F. Hogan called thestabbing ``the most devastating event in the hospital's 100-yearhistory,'' but insisted that proper procedures had been followed atConnecticut Valley Hospital.   Hogan said Peterson was not allowed to leave the building wherehe was assigned. But on Friday, Peterson apparently slipped awayfrom the hospital's unfenced campus and took a bus downtown.   According to a hospital report, other patients saw him on thebus and asked why he wasn't at the hospital. He told them he wasout on a day pass.   Peterson bought a $37 hunting knife at a sporting goods store,then attacked Jessica moments after she walked out of the F.W.Woolworth store nearby, authorities said. She was stabbedrepeatedly in the face and neck.   ``In the wake of this incident, we must conclude that tighteningsecurity for forensic patients is necessary,'' Hogan said.   Patients are granted privileges under a five-step program in usefor years at the hospital in this central Connecticut city 15 milessouth of Hartford.   From now on, any changes recommended by a patient's treatmentteam will be reviewed by a forensic psychiatrist, Hogan said.   ``This system has worked well for thousands of patients overmany years and is used in many hospital, but there is no questionthat it did not work in this case to prevent a horribleoccurrence,'' the commissioner said.   Peterson was confined to the hospital last year for up to 15years after he was found innocent by reason of insanity on assaultand burglary charges.   Peterson's first run-in with the law came after he stabbed afellow student at Wethersfield High School in 1971. After that hewas in and out of state mental hospitals several times, said hissister-in-law, Ellen Peterson.   In 1987, Peterson was arrested again and convicted of stabbing aman at a boarding house where he was staying.   Funeral services for the child were scheduled for Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
