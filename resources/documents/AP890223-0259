The statement Wednesday from Eastern's pilots union came after ithad threatened to join the machinists in a possible March 4 walkout,and was seen as an overture to Texas Air Corp. Chairman FrankLorenzo, who controls Eastern.   Rick Chapman, secretary-treasurer of the master executive councilof the Eastern pilots union, said the pilots would cross machinistpicket lines ``if they (Eastern management) make it worth ourwhile.''   Chapman spoke with a small group of reporters at the Harvard Clubin New York, where the pilots union organized a presentation forfinancial analysts and Eastern creditors.   The Machinists represent about 8,500 mechanics, baggage handlersand other ground personnel at Miami-based Eastern. The union hasthreatened to strike over contract concessions demanded by Texas Airto save money at the airline, which has lost hundreds of millions ofdollars over the last several years.   Eastern spokesman Robin Matell in Miami said today the airline'snegotiators believe progress has been made recently on reaching anaccord with the pilots on a ``fence agreement.''   Eastern's ``fence'' proposal to the pilots, Matell said,guarantees that the airline would keep its fleet at the currentlevel, guarantees all pilots against layoffs, and prevents Eastern'sinternational routes from being transferred to another Texas Airsubsidiary.   The pilots, who are scheduled to meet with management on Monday,are seeking a contract guaranteeing their job security as well as apledge from Lorenzo not to sell any more Eastern assets. The unionalso wants management to outline a ``business plan for action'' forEastern and seeks the eventual merger of Eastern and ContinentalAirlines, another subsidiary of Texas Air.   But Ron Cole, a spokesman for the Eastern pilots union, saidtoday the union's negotiators weren't satisfied with the company's``fence'' proposal, which they believe didn't provide sufficientguarantees.   Officials of the Machinists union were not available for commentWednesday.   Eastern and the Machinists have been talking for 16 months. Theunion will be free to strike legally March 4 if no new contract isreached by then. A 30-day cooling-off period mandated by theNational Mediation Board expires at midnight March 3.   A federal mediator began meeting Wednesday in Washington withboth sides in an intensified effort to reach a settlement.   ``The pilots will go out (on strike) for pilot issues,'' saidWright B. George, another member of the pilots union council andchairman of the union's business committee. ``This has nothing to dowith the Machinists. If we go out, it will be for pilot issues.''   ``That's posturing for the longer term,'' said Robert Joedicke,an airline analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc., referring to thepilots' demand.   Joedicke and other observers believe it's unlikely that thehard-nosed Lorenzo would agree to such demands.   The pilots and Machinists at Eastern ``have no love betweenthem,'' Joedicke said. ``They're singing out of the same hymn bookjust because of sheer fear.''   Pilots at major airlines have rarely supported strikes by theirfellow unions, industry observers note.   The Eastern pilots officials said they have begun polling theirmembership on the strike issue and expect to have the results byMarch 2, one day before the Machinists' deadline.   Eastern, meanwhile, is instructing supervisors to avoid verbal orphysical confrontations with striking employees in the event ofmachinist walkout.   In a 26-page ``Supervisor Survival Kit,'' a copy of which wasobtained by The Associated Press, Eastern warned supervisors not to``permit any picketers or strikers to embroil you in shoutingmatches, exchanges of hostilities, physical confrontations or thelike.''   If there is a strike, supervisors also are told not to speak withthe press or ``any outside party'' about the airline's strikeplanning or decisions.</TEXT></DOC>
