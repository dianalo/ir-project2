TeamWeighs Smaller-Town Bids---By Hal Lancaster</HL><DD> 08/05/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><DATELINE> LOS ANGELES  </DATELINE><TEXT>   What they're calling the Al Davis Derby has attracted most of the usual suspects.    New York, of course, wants to revive its moribund domed-stadium project by luring Mr. Davis and his Los Angeles Raiders. Sacramento, Calif., is seeking major-city status through sports. Phoenix continues to fight Jacksonville, Fla., for the title of &quot;Most Wooed City to Not Get a National Football League Franchise.&quot; And one city -- which the Raiders won't name -- proposed a monstrous complex, including a football stadium, a 160,000-seat soccer stadium, a race track and a hotel, with a total cost of $500 million &quot;minimum,&quot; says John Herrera, the Raiders' senior administrator coordinating the stadium search.    But those big cities never stood a chance against the likes of Irwindale, Inglewood and Carson. Those small Southern California communities are, by most accounts, the leading candidates to become the gypsy Raiders' latest home.    Why? New York is easy to eliminate -- too many other teams, too much politics. And will New York ever be fully wired for cable? After all, the Raiders have high hopes for pay-per-view television.    The local contenders provide a way to tap into Southern California's huge TV market -- as well as offer easily accessible sites and relief from big-city politics. Mr. Davis may even wind up owning his own stadium; Irwindale has offered him a $115 million loan to build his own facility, to be repaid from stadium revenues.    Of course, all these talks could be dog-and-pony shows designed to prod the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum Commission, his present landlords, to bend to his will. Mr. Davis' top aides insist that the Raiders will move. But where? Here are the leading contenders, a diverse and in some ways, strange lot.    IRWINDALE: An industrial town of 1,040 people and some gravel pits in the San Gabriel Valley 20 miles east of Los Angeles. Irwindale was dismissed as a remote flyspeck until news leaked of its proposed loan. With $150 million of bonding authority and $36 million in the bank, the city has recruited industry aggressively. It even co-owns a new restaurant, constructed because &quot;the only other place for business people to go for lunch was the vice mayor's taco stand,&quot; says Xavier Hermosillo, a public-relations consultant and one of the city's negotiators.    Mr. Hermosillo concedes the Raiders were skeptical until Mr. Davis took a helicopter tour of the 85-acre site, a 160-foot-deep gravel pit with land for offices, practice fields and parking. And the city eased one concern by conducting a survey of luxury-box holders-in-waiting. &quot;People who live in Holmby Hills, Calabasas said they'd much rather go to Irwindale than Inglewood,&quot; Mr. Hermosillo insists, citing the city's low crime and traffic.    INGLEWOOD: Several financing alternatives have been discussed by this community of 102,888 just south of Los Angeles, says Neil Papiano, general counsel of Hollywood Park Race Track, the prime mover in the city's bid.    Inglewood is located near major freeways and dense population areas, including West Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, where many Raiders' season-ticket holders reside. Parking and utilities already exist for the race track, hotel and arena that occupy the site, so construction costs would be minimized.    CARSON: Image is a problem in this city of 85,000, known mostly for its reeking oil refineries. And it doesn't help matters that the proposed site is a toxic-waste dump that will cost millions to clean. It is also in bankruptcy court with $45 million in liens against it. For those reasons, the city of has fallen behind in the Davis Derby, concedes Frank Gutierrez, chairman of the city's planning commission, who initiated contact with the Raiders.    Not to worry, Mr. Gutierrez insists. The bankruptcy court will be eager to unload the land at bargain-basement prices and the city will lean on the industrial firms who dumped at the site to pay for the cleanup. Whether all this can be done and a stadium built in time for the 1992 season, in a state with tough environmental restrictions, is uncertain.    The site isn't without appeal, with its 157 acres located midway between downtown Los Angeles and Orange County at the confluence of the Harbor and San Diego Freeways, which link most of Southern California's most populous areas. &quot;We've told them to expect an offer less than the other cities,&quot; Mr. Gutierrez says. &quot;If we can come close, we have a chance to nab them.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
