Three-Five has Europeanheadquarters in Swindon, Wiltshire.andM;- o -andM;Epson America Inc, Torrance, California has unveiled a switchable 16MHz/8MHz80386SX-based laptop computer, the Equity LT-386SX, which is designed foreasy swapping of 20Mb or 40Mb disks and the facility to install a variety ofadd-on boards in the three slots - one for modem, one for 2Mb more memory anda two-thirds size AT slot: it has 2Mb memory standard, paper white liquidcrystal display screen putting up 640 by 480 pixel resolution and full VideoGraphics Array compatibility; it runs on the mains or for three hours on aNickel Cadmium battery; its $5,300 with 20Mb disk.andM;- o -andM;Advanced Micro Devices Inc says it is sampling &quot;the world's first ISDNterminal control circuit that can be used to build terminals that conform toCCITT power specifications&quot; - which enable terminals for Integrated ServicesDigital Network to be powered from the telephone line during emergencies whenother sources of power might be out: the Am79C30A Digital SubscriberController, a monolithic CMOS part with EPROM, static RAM, a microcontrollerand a power controller, are all the circuits needed in an ISDN terminalsupporting the two B and single D channels required by the CCITT, the companyclaims, adding that the thing draws not more than 1W; volume production isset for the third quarter, at $15 apiece if you order enough of the things.andM;- o -andM;Cirrus Logic Inc, Milpitas, California has come out with three new parts thatis says will enable customers to develop new generations of high-performanceintelligent hard disk drives: the CL-SH265 Enhanced PC XT/AT Disk Controllerhas a data rate of up to 24M-bits per second and buffer throughput of up to8M-bytes per second and is aimed at the next generation of low-power laptopcomputers - it has a Power Down mode that cuts power consumption by about 75%when the drive is not in use; the CL-SH255 Integrated SCSI Disk Controller isaimed at developers of cost-sensitive computer systems and non-personalcomputer applications, such as font and document storage in laser printers;and a 32MHz version of the CL-SH350 High-Performance Synchronous/AsynchronousIntegrated SCSI Disk Controller, claimed to be the fastest single-chip SCSIcontroller available, for high-performance 3.5&quot; and 5.25&quot; drives; samples ofall three will be available shortly with volume in the third, at $22, $17 and$36 respectively for 1,004*p.andM;- o -andM;CBIS-Kingston Ltd, the European joint venture software and services companyformed by Cincinnati Bell Information Systems and Kingston Communications Plchas announced the purchase Edinburgh-based mobile telephone networkmanagement firm SCL Group Plc, an acquisition first highlighted here lastmonth (CI No 1,407): how much CBIS-Kingston paid for SCL has not yet beenreleased.andM;- o -andM;US Sprint Communications Inc, Kansas City, Missouri reports that its 56Mbpsvirtual private network is being used for near-instantaneous transmission ofnuclear medicine images using Macintosh II personal computers: the processeliminates the need for big, expensive computers and the use of modems andX-ray film and enables outlying medical facilities to be linked to largerhealthcare centers so that doctors in different regions can consult withcomplete information on complex medical cases; images and data are sentdirectly from a Gamma camera linked to a Macintosh IIcomputer over the VPN 56network.andM;- o -andM;Instrument and test equipment maker Instron Corp, Canton, Massachusetts hascompleted acquisition of Laboratory MicroSystems Inc, Troy, New York: the twohave worked closely for four years on joint software developments, andInstron reckons that worldwide distribution of the prize's laboratoryinformation management systems product would have a more significant impactwith it as a wholly-owned Instron company.andM;- o -andM;Pandamp;O European Ferries is to update its reservations system using DEC hardwareand software from Autofile Ltd: beginning with the Dover to Boulogne route,the viewdata system is being streamlined by adding facilities such aselectronic data interchange between travel agents and reservations staff;cost of the project is #3.7m; the first line will be completed in 1991.andM;- o -andM;Micromedix Inc, Denver, Colorado has added the Know Abuse database to itsline of computerised information systems: the new product is designed to helphealth care professionals to assist employers with drug screening programmesto assess and interpret urine test results and can also help in understandingtherapeutic uses, kinetics and toxicity of possibly abused drugs - marijuana,cocaine and amphetamines; it is available on floppy for MS-DOS machines; noprice.andM;- o -andM;The National Computing Centre Ltd in Manchester has become a distributor forthe X/Open verification suites testing conformance to XPG2 and XPG3portability guide compliance, which is needed before X/Open branding can begranted: the VSX2 and VSX3 test suites will be offered for licence bysuppliers developing new products, and the NCC will also operate a formaltesting service for products, using the test suite at the client's site.andM;- o -andM;ICL has named Eltec Ltd, Barron McCann Ltd, PSL Ltd and Control C SoftwareLtd as the distributors to lead its attack on the the personal computermarket: according to the company, it now has six distributors and istargeting a 10% market share, hoping to realise the extra sales through thedealer sector in the commodity market;

Co SpA, butPhilips says it is talking to several companies, and a deal in which thecompany handed much of the business over to ICL, which has plenty of productsthat it could put through Philips' outlets, in return for a minority stake inthe enlarged group, would make sense - but substantial closures would berequired at Philips to make the thing work.andM;- o -andM;Data General Corp reckons that the cost savings it has implemented shouldenable it to break even this fiscal if sales are not better than flat withlast year, and it looks to return to profits next fiscal: the cuts are notfinished and it looks to shed another 1,000 people by the end of the year, bywhich time it reckons that the new AViiON Unix machines start generating morebusienss than the Eclipse MV minis.andM;- o -andM;ICL has another splash this week, this time for its entry into the 80486stakes with a DRS machine expected to run Unix, MS-DOS and OS/2: the machine,tipped to come with 25MHz processor, 128Kb cache and 4Mb is thought to owe alot to Taiwanese manufacturer Acer Corp.andM;- o -andM;West Columbia, South Carolina-based Wells American Corp has formed asubsidiary for the development and marketing of hardware for the AppleComputer Inc Macintosh: the new company, NewCo Technology Inc, has anon-going research and development programme and plans to start manufacturinglater on this year.andM;- o -andM;Businessland Inc agreed to pay an undisclosed sum for the 35-employeethree-outlet Albany, New York micro dealer Computer Professionals Inc.andM;- o -andM;Attention!
