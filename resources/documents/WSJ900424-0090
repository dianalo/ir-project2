Veteran correspondents Ike Pappas of CBS and Jack Reynoldsand Peter Hackes of NBC left highly visible, well-payingnetwork jobs, but are bouncing back with their own smallbusinesses. And they're prospering, in part, by responding tothe very conditions that are making life miserable for thethree major networks: intense competition from independentstations and the Fox quasi-network, the proliferation ofcable channels, and the increased use of home videocassetteplayers.</LP><TEXT>   In the mid-1980s, Mr. Pappas, a hustling, cherubicreporter who specialized in defense issues, found himselfincreasingly elbowed aside by younger, more telegenicreporters. In March 1987, CBS Inc. pulled the plug on Mr.Pappas's 23-year network career. At age 52 he was laid off,one of 12 correspondents and 200 other CBS employees givenpink slips in a cost-cutting move. Mr. Pappas departed with apocketful of severance pay, wondering if his narrowprofessional skills were salable.   For 23 years at CBS, Mr. Pappas says, &quot;the only thing Ithought about was getting on Walter Cronkite and Dan Rather.&quot;Now his thoughts are focused on propelling his own mediaenterprise here, a video and film-production company namedIke Pappas Network Productions Inc. that makes industrials(corporate-client work) and TV documentaries.   Broadcast veterans such as Mr. Pappas understand the worldof sound bites, says Tom Angell, the president of InterfaceVideo Systems Inc., a video-production company here. &quot;Peoplewho can tell stories the way Americans are comfortable withare going to find themselves a place in this industry,&quot; hesays.   Mr. Reynolds, who says he spent &quot;32 mostly happy years atNBC,&quot; has found a niche producing video news releases. Thevideos are available free, by satellite, to roughly 600 localTV stations, which use such pieces on their news programs.Mr. Reynolds last week produced a piece dealing withconfusion over the taxation of pension benefits. Heinterviewed an Internal Revenue Service assistantcommissioner, a member of Congress, an irate contractor and afinancial adviser.   The 2 1/2-minute piece, paid for by the American Societyof Pension Actuaries, laid out multiple sides of the issue.&quot;I was as objective as I could be,&quot; Mr. Reynolds says.   His two-year-old company, Jack Reynolds Communications,also coaches camera-shy people to communicate effectively ontelevision. (A second Reynolds company is exploringinternational teleconferencing, concentrating on Asia and theEuropean Community.) Mr. Reynolds, 56, also spent two yearsas co-host of a bilingual Japanese program that exploredcultural differences between Americans and Japanese.   Peter Hackes worked 31 years as an NBC radio and TVreporter, but jumped in 1987 when the network suggested earlyretirement. His on-air time was slipping and other reporterswere getting the plum assignments. &quot;I realized I was on the Blist,&quot; he says.   Now 65, Mr. Hackes juggles a variety of media projects(and says his earnings in 1989 topped his former NBC salary).He consults for the American Association of Retired Persons,which sponsors his 90-second daily radio spot on issues forthe elderly. He has moderated satellite teleconferences ontax reform and a drug-free workplace.   And with sweet irony, he was cast in the role of aTV-network news director in the hit movie &quot;Broadcast News.&quot;&quot;I was the heavy,&quot; he says of his movie role. &quot;I fired 27people.&quot;   The most visible of the ex-network enterprisers is Mr.Pappas. The videos produced by his two-year-old company,which he calls Ike Inc. for short, usually feature Mr. Pappashimself.   Mr. Pappas, now 55, took the entrepreneurial plunge byrenting a one-room office in the building next door to theCBS news bureau here. He says, &quot;I turned on the lights and itwas completely bare. I thought, `Well, the rent is running, Ibetter do something.'&quot; To save money, he bought usedfurniture from the defunct public-relations firm of PresidentReagan's former confidant, Michael Deaver. &quot;I have MichaelDeaver's stapler on my desk,&quot; Mr. Pappas says with a chuckle.   The start-up gave Mr. Pappas, who admits he seldom thoughtabout the forces behind his weekly CBS paycheck, a lesson inbusiness humility. &quot;Cash flow has been a great revelation,&quot;Mr. Pappas says. &quot;What comes in, goes out. I can see howpeople fail very easily.&quot;   Mr. Pappas's company has made fund-raising videos for theGreek Orthodox Church, the Leukemia Society of America and agroup trying to build a monument here to slainlaw-enforcement officers.   His company turned a profit in its second year, Mr. Pappassays. The non-network TV and video distributors &quot;all wantprogramming,&quot; he says. &quot;It's a very hungry market out there.&quot;   Mr. Pappas also narrated the TV series &quot;CrimewatchTonight,&quot; a nightly half-hour chronicle of murders and drugbusts around the nation. The syndicated show ran for 26 weeksin 90 cities, but wasn't renewed by its producer. Mr. Pappassays it suffered from poor scheduling, including competitionfrom Mets baseball games in New York.   Mr. Pappas sees his image with television viewers as anasset, and he isn't bashful about promoting himself incompany projects. &quot;We're attempting to do things to keep meon the air,&quot; he says.   Running a small business is &quot;the most fun I've had in mylife,&quot; Mr. Pappas says. But he admits that the switch tosmall-business owner hasn't been easy. In his network days,he stood before the cameras in his trench coat and talkedabout such weighty topics as guided missiles and thestrategic arms-limitation talks. &quot;Now I stand in front of ashopping mall and say, `This is the biggest shopping mall inthe world.' It's a hell of an adjustment.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
