The Treasury secretary arrived here yesterday with personal assurances from President Reagan on both points. Washington is trying to counter any apprehension among moderate Arab states following recent disclosures that the administration secretly sold weapons to Tehran in an effort at least partly designed to win release of Americans being held hostage.    Mr. Baker is expected also to tell Saudi King Fahd that the U.S. would like to see the current volatility in world oil prices reduced. U.S. officials stressed the secretary wouldn't try to suggest that oil prices ought to go higher or lower, but merely that they should fluctuate less frequently.    Mr. Baker came here to attend a two-day annual meeting of the U.S.-Saudi Joint Commission on Economic Cooperation, a bilateral working group set up in 1974 to exchange technical and financial advice.    Administration officials insisted that Mr. Baker's attempt to convey the president's assurances on the Iranian arms issue was strictly a U.S. initiative, and that the Saudis hadn't formally sought any clarification of U.S. intentions.    Nevertheless, moderate Arab states have made no secret that they have been concerned in the wake of the Iran-Contra scandal about the course of U.S. policy. Some fear a victory by Iran could threaten countries like Saudi Arabia and possibly alter the balance of power in the Middle East.    It wasn't clear what the U.S. wants the Saudis to do to help reduce volatility of world oil prices. Presumably, at the least, Washington wants Riyadh to manage production levels to minimize price fluctuations, and to use its influence to persuade other oil producing countries to do the same.    One U.S. official said American businesses, even in oil-producing states, have complained that short-term changes in oil prices pose more of a problem than the actual price levels. He said that lower oil prices have been good for the U.S. economy.    U.S. officials stressed that Mr. Baker isn't trying to push for any particular price level. &quot;The important thing is not to have as much volatility,&quot; one official said.    Mr. Baker also is expected to discuss the impact of the U.S. dollar's continuing slide on the Saudi economy. Oil prices are set in U.S. dollars internationally, and Saudi Arabia has been suffering a loss in purchasing power as a result of the declining dollar.    With oil prices already below their early 1980s levels, the Saudi economy is in a recession, and the Saudis are being forced to dip into their reserves. The U.S. official said the Saudis were &quot;very unhappy&quot; about the decline of the dollar. </TEXT></DOC>
