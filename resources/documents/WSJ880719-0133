JOHN'S, Newfoundland  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Canadian government agreed to shoulder much of the financial risk of the Hibernia oil project, providing Mobil Corp. and its partners with as much as 2.7 billion Canadian dollars (US$2.23 billion) in grants and loan guarantees.    The project to develop the oil field off Canada's east coast is the largest and most expensive energy development ever undertaken in the country. It will cost an estimated C$5.2 billion to bring the field into production in 1995, and an additional C$3.3 billion in development costs over its 15- to 20-year lifespan.    In addition to the federal government's contribution, Newfoundland province agreed to forgo most sales tax for the project's capital and operating costs, and take a cut in royalties from Hibernia production.    The federal government's agreement to take on much of the initial risk was in return for a share of profits later on. The Hibernia field was discovered in 1979, but its development has been delayed because of low oil prices and jurisdictional disputes between the federal and Newfoundland governments.    &quot;We recognize that frontier oil production is a gamble, especially in light of the recent (oil) price gyrations,&quot; said Arne Nielsen, president of Mobil Oil Canada Ltd., a unit of Mobil and the project's operator, at a signing ceremony yesterday in St. John's.    Mobil Oil Canada has a 28.1% stake in Hibernia. Its partners are Gulf Canada Resources Inc. controlled by the Reichmann family of Toronto, 25%; Petro-Canada, owned by the Canadian government, 25%; Chevron Canada Resources Ltd., a unit of Chevron Corp., San Francisco, 16.4%, and Columbia Gas Development of Canada Ltd., a unit of Columbia Gas System Inc., Wilmington, Del., 5.5%.    Hibernia's production will be sold on the world market, and some of the oil is expected to be shipped by tanker to Boston, Portland, Me., and other northeastern U.S. ports.    The go-ahead for the Hibernia project could spur the development of other nearby, offshore fields, including the Terra Nova and White Rose discoveries, said a federal government official.    Hibernia's oil reserves are estimated at 525 million to 650 million barrels, or equal to about 11% to 13% of proven reserves in Western Canada. Its projected daily output of 110,000 barrels represents about 6.6% of Canada's current daily production.    Under the tentative agreement, which must be fashioned into a definitive pact by next March, the federal government will provide the Hibernia consortium with 25% of construction costs to a maximum C$1.04 billion. It also will provide as much as C$1.66 billion in nonrecourse financing, repayable over eight years after production begins. Company spokesmen said they believed the agreement was the first leveraged financing of an offshore energy project in which loan guarantees won't appear as debt on the companies' balance sheets.    In return for its risk-taking, the federal government will receive 10% of Hibernia's annual profit after all loans and interest assistance have been repaid.    Richard Carl, senior vice president, Merrill Lynch Canada Inc., said it was an &quot;intelligent&quot; arrangement, protecting the companies from much of the risk of an oilprice collapse, and giving the government a stake in the profits. He said without government aid the project would be highly risky because of fluctuating oil prices.    Some critics claim the development is being heavily supported for political reasons by the Conservative government of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, who is widely expected to call a national election this fall. The Sunday Express, an independent newspaper in St. John's, argued in an editorial that with &quot;oil prices at their lowest levels in nearly 15 years&quot; the Hibernia project is being driven by politics rather than by the market.    A government official said the guaranteed loans won't be in jeopardy as long as the price of oil remains above US$12.50 a barrel in 1987 dollars. However, Richard Matzke, president of Chevron Canada, said the project &quot;becomes uneconomic&quot; below US$20 a barrel in current dollars. The two sides seemed unable to reconcile their assessments of the price at which the field is economically viable. Oil prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange were quoted at US$15.65 a barrel yesterday for August delivery.    The project would involve construction of a massive concrete platform to be attached to the sea floor, about 180 miles off the coast of Newfoundland. The oil would be moved ashore by three tankers, strengthened to cope with ice floes in the Atlantic. The companies have agreed to buy Canadian goods and hire Canadian workers if costs are competitive.    The Hibernia project should make it easier for Columbia Gas Canada to sell its Canadian properties, which were put up for sale two months ago, said company president Spencer Chambers. Had the Hibernia project not gone ahead, &quot;I don't think we would have got much of a price,&quot; said Mr. Chambers. </TEXT></DOC>
