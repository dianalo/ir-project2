Wise, who filed the suit in U.S. District Court in Boston, saidan informal letter of agreement between the Navy and New EnglandAquarium would not be a legal transaction for the dolphin. He saidthe trade requires a formal permit from the National MarineFisheries Service.   Aquarium spokeswoman Audrey Conley said the aquarium followedFisheries Services procedures and received appropriate documentsfor the dolphin.   Roddy Moscoso of the fisheries service in Washington said: ``Weconsider the dolphin Rainbow to be legally residing at theaquarium.''   Over the weekend, the coalition and other animal rights groupsprotested outside the aquarium after learning of a proposed deal totrade a male dolphin named Rainbow to the Naval Ocean SystemsCenter in San Diego, Calif., for a partly deaf female dolphin.   The aquarium said Rainbow must be moved because it has becometoo agressive to get along with other dolphins.   John H. Prescott, the aquarium's executive director, saidSaturday that public interest led him to rethink the swap. But theaquarium spokeswoman said Monday that no decision has been reached.   Opposition to the trade stems from reports that the Navy trainsdolphins to kill enemy frogmen. The Navy says it trains and studies142 marine mammals in classified underwater surveillance anddetecting and marking objects for recovery.</TEXT></DOC>
