Alternatively, primary renal parenchymaldisease may manifest vascular alterations, which are indicative of thepathogenetic condition. Thus for these groups of diseases, imaging ofthe renal circulation frequently provides information that will leadto a generic or specific diagnosis. Traditionally, renal vascular imaginghas been accomplished by conventional film-screen angiography. More recently,however, digital subtraction angiography has become established as anadvantageous method of diagnosing renal vascular diseases. In additionthe role of angiography is becoming increasingly extended to includetherapeutic applications, such as percutaneous transluminal angioplastyfor renal artery stenosis and transcatheter embolization of parenchymalabnormalities. The contents of this chapter are twofold: In the firstsection (The Procedures and Their Attributes) the authors describe thetechniques, their applications, and their virtues and disadvantages.The second section (Vascular Imaging and Renal Disease) places thesevascular imaging methods within the context of evaluating and treatingrenal disease.</TEXT></DOC>
