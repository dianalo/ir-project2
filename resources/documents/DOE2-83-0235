In the present study, they have analyzed the leukemic cellsfrom one such patient with probes from the immunoglobulin heavy-chainlocus, which is present on band q32 of chromosome 14. Using a probe forthe {alpha} constant-region gene segments, they detected a rearrangedband by Southern blot analysis. This rearranged band was cloned and mapped.A subclone free of repetitive sequences was shown to be from chromosome19 by analysis of human-mouse somatic cell hybrids, confirming that therearranged band contains the translocation breakpoint junction. Thisprobe may be used to identify a gene on chromosome 19 adjacent to thebreakpoint that can contribute to the malignant development of B lymphocytes.</TEXT></DOC>
