Gorbachev led the nation Friday inmourning Andrei D. Sakharov in a dramatic show of respect for thephysicist and human rights champion the Kremlin once subjected tointernal exile, force-feeding and KGB harassment.   Sakharov, who won the the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975, diedThursday at age 68 in his Moscow home, apparently of a heartattack, as he prepared for the latest battle in his war fordemocracy and human rights.   A brilliant scientist, Sakharov helped develop the hydrogenbomb. But he sacrificed the perks and honors due a top scientist topursue a human rights campaign that spanned three decades and madehim the conscience of the nation.   He lived to see many of his dreams come true and his own peopleacknowledge his greatness, as the rest of the world had done muchearlier.   But he died without fulfilling his latest cause: forcing theCommunist Party to give up its monopoly on power.   Gorbachev, who in 1986 freed Sakharov from nearly seven years inexile in the remote city of Gorky, frequently argued with him inpublic but was respectful in the end.   ``He was not some sort of political intriguer,'' the Kremlinchief told reporters during a break in a session of the Congress ofPeople's Deputies. ``He was a person who had his own ideas, his ownconvictions which he expressed openly and directly. I valued thisin him. This doesn't mean I agreed with him, although on manythings we did agree.''   President Bush sent a message to Sakharov's widow, fellow humanrights activist Yelena Bonner, saying, ``All of us are diminishedby his utimely death.''   ``All of us who knew him will never forget his courage anddevotion to freedom,'' Bush said. ``In the darkest hours of hisstruggle for human rights in the Soviet Union, he embodied all thatis good and decent in the human spirit.''   Sakharov died alone in his study after returning home from ameeting of opposition deputies, where he charged the Soviethierarchy was leading the country to catastrophe. His body wasdiscovered by his wife.   Yefrem Yankelevich, Sakharov's son-in-law, said Sakharov's lastwords to his family were: ``Tomorrow there will be a battle'' _ areference to his plans to press again for an end to the CommunistParty's monopoly on power.   He then went to prepare for Friday's session of the Congress,the parliament to which he was elected this year.   The congress formed a committee to organize the funeral. Asecretary at the Lebedev Physics Institute where Sakharov workedsaid he would be buried Monday alongside his parents atVostryakovskoe Cemetery in southwest Moscow. Gorbachev said hewould attend.   Bonner, Sakharov's source of strength and his companion duringthe years of struggle and exile, sat in a chair next to the bodyFriday. A few close friends were admitted to the study, a separateapartment one floor down from his seventh floor apartment onMoscow's Garden Ring Road.   Sakharov, who suffered angina, had looked tired in recentmonths, which were filled with foreign trips and work as a deputy.   Age and poor health curtailed his activities _ he looked farolder than his years _ but when he felt he had to speak out, he did.   Though he was a poor speaker, with a slight stutter andhigh-pitched voice, the public had come to know and like Sakharovso much that an unscientific newspaper poll in October indicated hewas the most popular parliamentarian _ outscoring even Gorbachevand the maverick Communist Boris N. Yeltsin.   An official statement showed how far the country had come fromthe days when Sakharov was vilified.   ``Everything that he did was dictated by his tirelessconscience, his deep humanitarian convictions,'' Vitaly I.Vorotnikov, a member of the Presidium of the Congress and theCommunist Party Politburo, said in announcing Sakharov's death tothe deputies.   Fellow scholar-deputy Dmitri Likhachev told the deputies: ``WithSakharov, a part of our heart has departed from us.''   Human rights activist Natan Sharansky, who spent nine years inSoviet labor camps before emigrating to Israel in 1986, saidSakharov ``helped change the whole climate in the Soviet Union.''   Lech Walesa, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, saidSakharov's death was ``a great loss for reform both in the SovietUnion and everywhere else.''   ``We needed this man for reforms and for the troubles connectedwith them,'' he told the Polish PAP news agency.   Gorbachev's reform program brought progress toward the goalsSakharov had set since he turned from nuclear physics to humanrights: withdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan, glasnost _ oropenness _ on the country's problems, the right to strike, economicautonomy for factories, amnesty for political prisoners and freedomof emigration.   But Sakharov pressed harder.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
