The Soviet ``police attache'' would be the first such officialin any Soviet diplomatic mission in the Western world, said John deBlaey, a senior Hague police administrator.   De Blaey has just returned from a week-long trip to Moscow,where he said the request was made to him by KGB chief Vladimir A.Kryuchkov.   Officially known as the State Security Committee, the KGB isbelieved to be the world's most extensive secret police force andespionage organization.   Dutch officials have warned that Moscow is stepping up itsespionage efforts, especially in the area of high technology,although expulsions of Soviet citizens from the Netherlands havebeen extremely rare in recent years.   The new KGB officer would be a crime-fighter concentrating onexchanging information with Dutch police on issues like extortion,fraud and drug smuggling, De Blaey told The Associated Press onWednesday.   He would be ``a KGB figure in the new style and act in public asa KGB officer,'' said De Blaey.   Kruychkov and Moscow police chief P.S. Bogdanov said they coulduse such a liaison officer abroad because their nation is not amember of Interpol, the world's biggest international policeinformation network, De Blaey said.   The Interior Ministry, which would have to approve the request,could not immediately be reached for comment.   ``Mr. Kryuchkov said that the KGB is developing into a kind ofFBI in addition to its traditional intelligence-gathering task,''De Blaey said.</TEXT></DOC>
