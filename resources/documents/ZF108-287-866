 Although the trend toward a service economyin this country is undeniable, it seems to me that the bedrock of an economylies in its value-added manufacturing capability.andP;  Naturally, I think thefact that AI technology is making a major impact in manufacturing is a goodsign.andP;  According to our own inimitable columnist Harvey Newquist, theseapplications are the fastest growing segment of the AI market, accounting forperhaps 20% of the 1989 sales of AI hardware and software.andP;  And thepenetration rate is still quite low: in a recent survey, only about 4% of themanufacturing companies questioned use AI in their operations, but many moreare evaluating how the technology may apply to them.andM;In a very basic sense, manufacturing equals raw materials plus technologyplus organization.andP;  Successful manufacturing requires &quot;the right stuff&quot;: theright tools and sequence of events.andP;  Even the paleolithic craftsman had hisfavorite sources of obsidian, his specialized production tools, and knowledgeinherited from the elders of how to produce the incredibly sharp andbeautiful blades we see in museums.andP;  As civilization developed the toolsbecame more specialized, but for a long time they didn't increase incomplexity.andP;  Relatively simple tools were used to build the monolithicpyramids of Egypt and the intricate, water-driven automata of the AlexandrianGreeks.andP;  The development of the clockmaking industry in Renaissance Europedemanded a new level of specialized and more technically complex tools, andthe industrial revolution caused a dramatic increase in the complexity ofmanufacturing toolsets.andP;  Today's modern factories are literally filled withhighly complex--and often computerized--manufacturing equipment.andM;Currently, the major impact of AI is on the technological side of themanufacturing process.andP;  Due to its complexity, the diagnosis, repair, andmaintenance of highly automated machinery is getting increasingly difficult.andO;This job is one perfectly suited to diagnostic expert systems, and they formthe bulk of expert systems in manufacturing settings.andP;  (Robert Rowen'sarticle on pp.andP;  28-37 discusses this issue in detail).andP;  Not only can thesystems help diagnose problems, but they can also help to ensure that repairand maintenance procedures can be understood by technicians.andP;  These systemsare also excellent vehicles for teaching new personnel how to manipulate andmaintain complicated equipment.andM;Some important industrial products--semiconductors, for example--requirehundreds, if not thousands, of precisely controlled processing steps toproduce the product.andP;  Expert systems, coupled with machinery sensors, canhelp to ensure that the required processes are applied and correctlycontrolled.andM;The modern factory, though frequently highly automated, is only slightlyintegrated.andP;  Only the very largest manufacturing organizations (autocompanies, for example) can afford to build new, fully integrated factoriesfrom the ground up.andP;  The bulk of manufacturing organizations, if attemptingintegration at all, must develop a more piecemeal approach to the problem.andO;This area is another where AI will play a key role: helping companies migrateto the new integrated manufacturing style in an economically realistic andviable fashion.andP;  Object-oriented, knowledge-based techniques will allow theunique communication protocols of each piece of equipment to be encapsulatedwithin an intelligent interface layer.andP;  (See Dan Larner's article on pp.andO;38-45 for a discussion on object-oriented techniques.)andP;  This approach willallow companies to build clusters of intelligent work centers a piece at timeand slowly and deliberately grow their systems into distributed communicatingmanufacturing plants.andM;Organization is yet another area where AI will have a major positive impact.andO;Few people uninvolved with manufacturing realize how complex and importantthe scheduling and organizational tasks are in a manufacturing operation, orhow much they affect its overall profitability.andP;  They typically underestimatethe impact that scale and size have on the problem of developing viablemanufacturing strategies.andP;  The concepts underlying factory scheduling areeasy to explain, but problems arise from the sheer size of the task.andO;Scheduling a factory with a few workstations, scant raw materials, and ahalf-dozen products is easy.andP;  When you have hundreds or thousands ofdifferent parts in process through as many workstations on thousands ofdifferent work orders, the situation quickly becomes computationallyintractable.andM;In fact, the manufacturing schedules produced by most systems are obsolete assoon as they hit the floor.andP;  The application of knowledge-based heuristicscheduling techniques will soon offer the opportunity for dynamic, real-timefactory scheduling.andP;  (This month's Application Watch reports on a goodexample of such a system for forge scheduling.)andP;  Time literally is money inmanufacturing--making the maximum use of equipment can determine thedifference between financial success and failure.andP;  The ability to optimize amanufacturing facility's use is an area where AI will make a majorcontribution to the economic vitality of the manufacturing sector.andM;AI is also having a major impact on the design side of manufacturing.andO;Intelligent computer-aided design (CAD) tools are allowing designers to draftplans for very complex mechanical parts more quickly than ever.andP;  These toolshave constraints built into the front end--designers don't have to worryabout designing a part that simply isn't manufacturable; a common problemthat slows the design process.andP;  These new intelligent systems also allowdesigns to be transformed into matching specifications and then--at least intheory--fed into the computers controlling the manufacturing machinery.andM;Last, but certainly not least, the sensory side of AI--vision, robotics,speech, and hearing--are areas that will impact manufacturing in the future.andO;Though still in the experimental stages, machine-vision systems are perhapsthe furthest along.andP;  Intelligent robotic controllers are also migratingsteadily from the research labs into the development labs.andM;Though the hype level of AI has died down, the interest level is increasingdramatically.andP;  This sign is a healthy one for AI and one I'm glad to see.andO;Manufacturing, the backbone of the economy, will provide a nourishing soilfor practical AI to flourish and grow.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
