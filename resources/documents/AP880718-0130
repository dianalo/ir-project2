But McKay said he had decided not to seek criminal chargesagainst the attorney general because ``there is no evidence thatMr. Meese acted from motivation for personal gain. ... There is noevidence that he acted out of self-interest.''   In an 814-page report, McKay said Meese's 1985 tax return didnot declare some capital gains from the sale of securities and thatMeese did not pay income tax on his capital gains from those saleswhen he filed the return.   ``A trier of fact would probably conclude beyond a reasonabledoubt that Mr. Meese violated'' a section of the Internal RevenueCode by filing ``a materially false tax return,'' said McKay, whoadded that Meese probably also violated a section of the InternalRevenue Code for ``willfully failing to pay tax at the timerequired by law.''   Meese also probably violated a criminal conflict-of-interest lawin connection with his holdings of $14,000 in regional Belltelephone stock, but the independent counsel who investigated Meesefor 14 months disclosed today that he had decided not to prosecutethe case.   McKay said Meese owned the stock in the regional Bell companiesin 1985 and 1986, when he set in motion a review process that ledto a reversal of Justice Department policy. McKay also found thatMeese participated in discussions of proposed legislation to shiftregulatory responsibility for the breakup of ATandamp;T from a federalcourt and the Justice Department to the Federal CommunicationsCommission.   McKay said that ``a trier of fact would probably conclude beyonda reasonable doubt that Mr. Meese violated'' a federalconflict-of-interest law. That law makes it a felony for a U.S.official to participate personally and substantially in aparticular matter in which he or his spouse has a financialinterest.   McKay told reporters this afternoon the investigation had costabout $1.7 million as of the end of June, and he added, ``I feelconfident we have not wasted any government funds, any of thetaxpayers' money.''   He said the decision to accuse Meese of crimes without charginghim was probably the ``toughest mental decision we had to make.''He said he decided that charges in such matters would not have beenbrought against an ordinary citizen and therefore should not bebrought against Meese. He said there was no pattern of taxviolation by Meese or his wife and Meese had not shown bad faithand had not deliberately lied.   President Reagan ``is pleased that after extensive scrutiny, theindependent counsel did not charge the attorney general with anycriminal wrongdoing,'' presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater saidin Santa Barbara, Calif. ``As he has said before, the presidentfeels Ed Meese has been an outstanding attorney general.''   Nathan Lewin, Meese's attorney, said he views McKay's assertionthat Meese probably committed crimes as the actions of a ``hit andrun driver. It's a very cheap shot.''   Lewin accused McKay, in a news conference after the report wasreleased, of reaching inappropriate conclusions and of going beyondwhat ``any reasonable prosecutor would do.'' He said, however, hewas not accusing McKay of unethical conduct and considered him anhonorable man.   As for the tax return, Meese's investment manager, W. FranklynChinn, sold securities for Meese and his wife, Ursula, in May andJune 1985 and deposited the proceeds of $54,581 in the Meeses'account.   The Meeses realized a net capital gain of $20,706 from thesesales. They owed $3,479 in taxes, which was initially due on April15, 1986.   The Meeses were granted extensions for filing their return untilOct. 15, 1986.   A week before the Oct. 15 deadline, Meese told his accountant,John McKean, that the securities had been sold in 1985. But Meesedid not identify the securities or tell the accountant what thesale proceeds were or what their cost had been, facts necessary tocalculate the capital gain.   According to McKay, Meese had not yet located or assembled thatinformation.   McKean suggested to Meese, and Meese agreed, that the return befiled by the deadline without any reference to the securities salesand that an amended return disclosing the required information befiled as soon as possible.   McKay said that Meese finally filed an amended tax return onFeb. 6 of this year declaring a capital gain on the securitiessales of $14,606 and that Meese paid the tax due on that amountplus interest.   McKay noted that Meese filed the amended return ``shortly afterthe scheduling of the grand jury appearances for the Meeses'accountants'' in connection with McKay's criminal investigation ofthe matter.   ``Mr. Meese had a duty to report the securities sales and todeclare his capital gains income on his tax return filed Oct. 15,1986,'' said McKay.   ``Because that return did not disclose any information about the1985 securities sales, it was materially false,'' McKay declared.   ``It incorrectly stated the income and tax due without anynotation or other reference explaining that those figures did notinclude any information about the securities sales,'' said McKay'sreport.   In regard to the phone stock, McKay's report said that``Congress has declared ... that it is a criminal offense for anofficially personally and substantially to participate in aparticular matter in which he knows he has a financial interest.''   But McKay went on to say that Congress did not seek to limit aprosecutor's discretion in determining whether or not a probableviolation of the law warrants actual prosecution.   McKay said that ``there is no substantial federal interest inprosecuting probable violations resulting from an official'sparticipation in matters when a similar kind of participation ...was covered by waivers for periods both before and after theprobable violations occurred.''   McKay added that there was ``no evidence of deliberatecircumvention of the waiver process, concealment of the financialinterest, motivation for personal gain, or effect on governmentdecision-making.''   When he was White House counselor, Meese obtained a waiver fromthe White House counsel's office early in the Reagan administrationallowing him to participate in telecommunications matters, despitehis stock holdings in ATandamp;T.   In 1987, after he had became attorney general and met withexecutives of the regional Bells and participated in thelegislative initiative, Meese obtained another waiver from theWhite House counsel's office. This one permitted him to approveearly in 1987 a reversal of Justice Department position concerningthe regional Bells. Meese endorsed a position urging a federalcourt judge to allow the Bells to branch into new areas of business.   The independent counsel said that an argument could be made thatprosecuting an attorney general ``would serve as a significantdeterrent'' to other high-ranking public officials.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
