Background and Summary of Comments</ITAG>As a result of the investigation of an accident which occurred near Odessa,Delaware in October 1982, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB)recommended that the DOT ``. . . Determine by mode of transportation, thefeasibility of requiring comprehensive product-specific emergency responseinformation, such as Material Safety Data Sheets, to be appended to shippingdocuments for hazardous materials transported in bulk quantities, givingparticular attention to the early emergency response problems posed byn.o.s. commodities in transit.'' In October 1983, RSPA received a petitionfrom the American Trucking Associations (ATA) which requested DOT ``require,by rule, motor carriers involved in the transportation of hazardous materialsto maintain a copy of the Emergency Response (Guidebook), DOT P 5800.2,at each motor carrier facility where hazardous materials shipments areloaded or unloaded from vehicles.''In response to concerns expressed in the NTSB recommendation (I-83-2) andthe ATA petition (P-922), on March 16, 1984, RSPA published an advancenotice of proposed rulemaking (ANPRM) under Docket HM-126C in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(49 FR 10048). The ANPRM, entitled ``RequiredUse of Emergency Response Guidebooks and Material Safety Data Sheets'',quoted the NTSB recommendation and the ATA petition in their entirety,and solicited comments on the benefits and consequences of requiring theuse of the Emergency Response Guidebook (ERG) or Material Safety Data Sheets(MDSD) to communicate information on the hazards of materials moving incommerce.Evaluation of the comments to the ANPRM indicated a need for requiringadditional emergency response information on hazardous materials transportedin commerce. The majority of commenters supported RSPA requiring additionalemergency response information. However, only two commenters supportedthe NTSB recommendation that an MSDS accompany every bulk shipment of hazardousmaterials. Several commenters stated that although some of the informationon an MSDS might be useful, they believed that use of the ERG would bea more effective method of communicating fundamental hazard informationto emergency response personnel, and that the ERG should be maintainedas the primary reference.Based on RSPA's evaluation of the merits of the comments to the ANPRM,on August 30, 1987, a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) was publishedentitled ``Emergency Response Communication Standards'' under Docket No.HM-126C (53 FR 31486). The NPRM solicited comments on requiring improvedemergency response information on shipping papers and packages, and placementof emergency response information on vehicles and at facilities involvedin hazardous materials transportation. The NPRM addressed both bulk andnon-bulk packages.In the NPRM, it was noted that widespread support was expressed by commentersto the ANPRM for requiring use of the ERG. Many commenters believe thatto better inform emergency response personnel about the hazards of a material,the use of the ERG would satisfy the emergency response information requirements.The NPRM included a proposal to require that persons offering hazardousmaterials for transportation provide on the shipping paper a twenty-fourhour emergency response telephone number of a person knowledgeable aboutthe hazardous materials being shipped. In addition, the NPRM containeda proposal to require that technical names be shown on shipping papersand packages for materials which are described under ``n.o.s.'' or genericdescriptions. A detailed discussion of these proposals, as well as thecomments to these proposals follows.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Discussion of Comments Made to the NPRM</ITAG>RSPA received more than seventy comments to the NPRM under Docket HM-126C.Comments were received from associations, chemical companies, emergencyresponse organizations, and Federal and State agencies. Most commenterssupported the intent of the proposed rule to improve emergency responsecommunication during transportation incidents involving hazardous materials.However, many commenters expressed concern over certain aspects of theproposal and requested clarification on the use of certain technical names(i.e., proprietary or trade names) for ``n.o.s.'' entries, maintenanceof a twenty-four hour emergency response telephone number to obtain product-specificinformation on the hazardous material being transported, and the feasibilityof requiring placement of the ERG, MSDS or other emergency response informationon vehicles and at facilities.Major Issues<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Emergency Response Information</ITAG>ATA strongly supported requiring additional emergency response informationon shipping papers and packages, and placement of the ERG at facilities.However, ATA expressed concern about requiring the placement of the ERGon transport vehicles. ATA stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">(t)he cost of providing the ERG and insuring that it is on all transportvehicles will result in the expenditure of millions of dollars which wouldnot be cost effective to safety in the trucking industry.</ITAG>ATA did not provide quantitative or qualitative data in their commentsto support this contention. It should be noted that the NPRM did not proposeimposing mandatory use of the ERG on vehicles or at facilities to satisfythe emergency response information requirements, but rather the ERG couldbe used as one of several alternatives to satisfy those requirements. Althoughbusinesses may incur additional paperwork burdens, due to the requirementfor placement of emergency response information on transport vehicles,RSPA believes that those burdens are justified because the requirementwill improve the availability of information at the scene of an incidentinvolving hazardous materials and thereby enhance emergency response effortsduring such incidents.RSPA did not propose that drivers of motor vehicles or crews aboard aircraftor trains attempt themselves to take emergency response measures. Instead,RSPA believes that during the initial stages of an emergency, having thisinformation immediately available aboard a transport vehicle is importantto convey information concerning the risks of materials, the basic precautionsto be taken by transportation workers, and to improve the effectivenessof the first on the scene emergency responders.The Association of American Railroads (AAR) commented that the notice aswritten would require that emergency response information be maintainedon each rail car or ``transport vehicle.'' They stated that there is noplace on a rail car for this information to be placed and that there isno reason for this information to be placed on each individual rail car.To clarify our intent in regard to maintenance of and accessibility toemergency response information on ``transport vehicles'', the requirementaddressing carriers' responsibility for maintenance of written emergencyresponse information on transport vehicles, such as trucks, rail cars orvessels and barges, has been restated to require that emergency responseinformation be carried in the same manner as prescribed for shipping papers.The AAR stated that additional written emergency response information (e.g.,ERG) is unnecessary for rail shipments because they have the ``Hazardousor Dangerous Commodity Reports'' for each hazardous material in a train,which they feel satisfies the emergency response information requirements.Although having the ERG available would satisfy the emergency responseinformation requirements, other documents, for shipments by aircraft, vesseland rail, such as the ICAO ``Emergency Response Guidance for Aircraft IncidentsInvolving Dangerous Goods'', the IMO ``Emergency Procedures for Ships CarryingDangerous Goods'', and the ``Hazardous or Dangerous Commodity Reports'',respectively, may be used to satisfy the requirements for emergency responseinformation, as long as they contain the required emergency response informationand are present on the transport vehicle for each commodity.Representative of commenters supportive of carrying the ERG on-board vehicleswas the National Private Trucking Association (NPTA). NPTA stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">There are several sound reasons for carrying a copy of the ERG on-boardtransit vehicles. First, even though a significant number of ERGs havebeen distributed to emergency response organizations and personnel throughoutthe country, it is extremely unlikely that every emergency responder hasone, or that one would always be on-scene. The presence of an ERG on eachtransport vehicle should effectively remedy this. Second, and perhaps moreimportant, currently when most incidents involving hazardous materialsoccur, there is a period of time between the occurrence and the arrivalof trained first responders with, presumably, copies of an ERG and/or otheressential information to enable them to initiate an effective response.Consequently, as a rule for the majority of shipments currently takingplace, during that critical period of time, the truck driver, as well asany other passers-by who may happen on the scene, are without essentialinformation concerning the risk(s) which the materials being transportedmay pose to them and the public generally, or how to provide immediateand effective first aid should contact with a material have occurred.</ITAG>RSPA agrees with NPTA that having a copy of the ERG immediately availableduring a hazardous material emergency would be useful. However, compliancewith a requirement that emergency response information be immediately availablefor responders' use may also be accomplished in a number of other ways,such as by having emergency response information printed on the shippingpaper or use of an MSDS (if it contains all of the required information).Several commenters suggested that DOT require the ERG to be carried onall emergency response vehicles. DOT does not have statutory authorityto require carriage of the ERG on emergency response vehicles operatedby public entities. However, it has been the goal of RSPA, since the early1980's, that all emergency response vehicles carry a copy of the ERG. Tothis end, approximately 2.5 million copies of the ERG have been distributed,without charge, to emergency response organizations by RSPA.Widespread support was expressed in the comments to the NPRM for requiringadditional emergency response information to accompany hazardous materialsin transportation. Most commenters stated the ERG was the preferred sourcefor obtaining emergency response information. In this final rule, RSPAadopts a requirement essentially as proposed in the NPRM, that emergencyresponse information be maintained on transport vehicles, in the same manneras prescribed for shipping papers, and at facilities involved in the transportationof hazardous materials. While use of the ERG would be one method of compliance,flexibility is provided to afford use of other means to satisfy this requirement.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. N.O.S. Descriptions/Generic Descriptions</ITAG>The Chemical Waste Transportation Council (CWTC) supported showing thetechnical name for n.o.s. descriptions. However, CWTC stated that the requirementposes special administrative problems for non-bulk shipments of wastes.The CWTC stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">Keep in mind that non-bulk shipments of hazardous waste, as opposedto hazardous pure product, are normally comprised of a variety of wastestream packages. The extent of this variety becomes most complex with regardto the shipment of waste material packaged in accordance with 49 CFR 173.12(b).Yet, the risk presented by these divergent but compatible waste streamsis no greater, and for the most part is less hazardous, than its sourcematerial. Waste, after all, is often the dilute by-product or residue ofa pure hazardous material product. This is especially true of wastes withan n.o.s. status.</ITAG>The CWTC requested that DOT allow shippers of hazardous wastes to showwaste stream numbers in place of technical names for n.o.s. entries asprovided under the requirement in andSection;172.203(c) for hazardous substances.CWTC petitioned RSPA (petition number P-1033) to amend the HMR at 49 CFR172.203(c)(1) and 172.324(a) to exclude materials packaged in accordancewith the lab pack provisions in andSection;173.12 from the requirement ofshowing technical names for n.o.s. entries.RSPA did not intend to make the additional description and marking requirementsfor emergency response information for hazardous waste materials, packagedin accordance with the lab pack provisions, more burdensome to the hazardouswaste industry. On the contrary, RSPA agrees with CWTC comments that forhazardous waste materials, packaged in accordance with the lab pack provisions,inclusion of waste stream numbers rather than technical names for n.o.s.descriptions would meet the additional emergency response information requirements.Consequently, in andSection;173.12, a new paragraph (f) has been added toallow the use of waste stream numbers, instead of the required technicalname description, for hazardous waste packaged in lab packs. It shouldbe noted, however, that there is no exception in andSection;173.12, or elsewhere,from identifying the names of constituents contained in lab packs, if theconstituent is a hazardous substance or a poison.Most commenters supported including the technical name for n.o.s. or genericdescriptions on shipping papers. However, because many technical namesare quite lengthy or complicated, and commenters are concerned about thedisclosure of proprietary information or trade secrets, they recommendedincluding chemical family or generic names, common names, registered tradenames, or other names in the NIOSH registry in place of technical namesfor n.o.s. entries. Trade secrets include chemical formulations, and thecommenters believe that this information would not be protected if theywere required to include the technical names of these constituents on shippingpapers. RSPA believes that in emergency response situations, the additionof technical names for n.o.s. entries is the best way to identify the primaryand subsidiary hazards associated with a material. RSPA also realizes thatsome chemical technical names are extremely complex. In order to accommodatethe use of chemical names that are more readily recognizable and usableto emergency responders, the definition in andSection;171.8 for ``technicalname'' includes chemical names designated or recognized by the InternationalUnion of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the Chemical Abstracts Service,or in the Registry of Toxic Effects of Chemical Substances (RTECS). However,trade names may not be used as technical names.Further, RSPA believes there is sound reasoning to require improved identificationof chemical constituents. Commenters' concerns that ``trade secret'' informationmay be disclosed by showing these constituents on shipping papers for ``n.o.s.''descriptions have not been substantiated. As required by this final rule,if a hazardous material is a mixture or solution of two or more hazardousmaterials, only the technical names of at least two components most predominantelycontributing to the hazards of the mixture or solution are required tobe entered on the shipping paper. Furthermore, this final rule does notimpose mandatory revelation of an exact formulation, only disclosure ofvaluable safety related information to be used in the transportation network.Additionally, it is our belief that identifying the two major constituentswhich contribute to the hazards of a material will result in only limited,if any, instances where proprietary information would be revealed. Currentprovisions of the HMR for identifying constituents in poisons, hazardoussubstance mixtures and solutions, and any n.o.s. description for watershipments have not revealed a problem regarding the release of proprietaryinformation.Recently, RSPA has been made aware of a potential problem concerning theidentification of constituents of materials that are subject to the provisionsof 21 CFR 1301.74, as administered by the Drug Enforcement Administration(DEA). Paragraph (e) of that section states: ``* * * In addition, the registrantshall employ precautions (e.g., assuring that shipping containers do notindicate that contents are controlled substances) to guard against storageor in-transit losses.'' RSPA is not aware that the current constituentidentification requirements of the HMR have resulted in violations of theDEA requirements by persons shipping hazardous materials that are alsocontrolled substances. The requirements of this final rule should not causeany significant compliance difficulties. Of the controlled substances reviewedby RSPA, each has a general or other technical name which may be used toidentify the controlled substance in accordance with the requirements ofthis final rule, but which do not use terminology which readily identifiesthe hazardous material as a controlled substance.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Telephone Contact for Emergency Response Information</ITAG>Comments to the notice generally supported RSPA's proposal to require thatshipping papers contain the twenty-four hour telephone number of a personwith detailed knowledge of the hazardous characteristics of the materialsbeing shipped. The Chemical Manufacturers's Association (CMA) indicatedsupport for the provision that allows shippers to list CHEMTREC, or otherorganizations, with similar capabilities, as the initial contact pointfor emergency response information. CMA pointed out that it would be impracticalfor an individual or small company to provide a phone number in the absenceof this provision.CHEMTREC is a public service of the CMA. CHEMTREC has the capability toprovide immediate advice by telephone for the on-scene commander at a chemicalemergency, and can then promptly contact the shipper of the hazardous materialfor detailed assistance and an appropriate response follow-up. CHEMTRECoperates 24-hours a day, seven days a week to receive toll-free calls.CHEMTREC notifies the National Response Center (NRC) of significant incidents.If requested, they will connect a caller directly to the NRC, as requiredby Federal law and regulation. Other industry or government organizationsmay exist or be established which may provide similar services for specifiedcategories of materials. RSPA recognizes the difficulty experienced bysmall companies, who may not always have a 24-hour telephone number orhave an individual available to respond to inquiries on a 24-hour basis.This final rule allows for the use of an emergency response telephone numberother than the shipper's, provided the shipper has furnished an agencyor organization with detailed information concerning the hazardous material,and that the agency or organization is capable of, and has accepted responsibilityfor, providing such information. This option will provide a shipper theflexibility of selecting a name and number which will ensure a 24-houravailability of knowledgeable assistance.Although most commenters supported the proposal to require a 24-hour emergencyresponse telephone number on shipping papers, several expressed concernabout the requirement in andSection;172.604(a)(2) for the telephone numberto appear on the shipping paper ``in association with the basic description''.These commenters requested that the phone number be allowed anywhere onthe shipping paper, as long as it is noted that the number is shown forthe purpose of emergency response. In this final rule, the requirementsin andSection;172.604(a)(2) (i) and (ii) have been modified to require shippersto: (1) enter the emergency response telephone number on shipping papers``following the description of the hazardous material'', or (2) enteredonce on the shipping paper when the number applies to each material enteredon the shipping paper, it is clearly highlighted for easy identification,and it is indicated that the telephone number is to be used to obtain emergencyresponse information.In the NPRM, RSPA proposed, as an option for a package having a gross weightof 30 kilograms or less, that the 24-hour emergency response telephonenumber may be displayed on the outside of the package in association withthe proper shipping name rather than on the shipping paper. The UnitedParcel Service (UPS) and the Air Transportation Association of Americasupported the requirement that shipping papers contain a 24-hour emergencyresponse telephone number to obtain emergency response information concerninghazardous materials, but suggested that the 24-hour emergency responsetelephone number should not be placed on packages instead of being placedon shipping papers for packages of 30 kilograms or less. This suggestionwas based on their concern that, if a package is found to be damaged orleaking, emergency response personnel should not jeopardize their safetyby coming into contact with a leaking or damaged package to obtain theemergency response telephone number.Upon further consideration, RSPA agrees with the commenters. Consequently,the exception, as proposed in the NPRM, to allow shippers to place theemergency response telephone number on packages instead of being placedon shipping papers for packages of 30 kilograms or less has not been adopted.<ITAG tagnum="81">D. Additional Considerations</ITAG><T3>Applicability of emergency response information requirements to internationalshippers. </T3>The NPRM did not propose to except persons importing orexporting hazardous materials from compliance with requirements for writtenemergency response information. To clarify the applicability of emergencyresponse information requirements to import/export shipments of hazardousmaterials, andSection; 171.11, applicable to shipments of hazardous materialsconforming to the International Civil Aviation Organization's TechnicalInstructions for the Safe Transport of Dangerous Goods by Air (ICAO TechnicalInstructions), is revised in this final rule to require compliance withemergency response information requirements in Subpart G of Part 172 ofthis subchapter. It should be noted that no change in the requirementsof andSection; 171.12 have been adopted in this final rule, therein, shipmentsof hazardous materials made in accordance with the provisions of this sectionare not excepted from the shipping paper or emergency response informationrequirements. RSPA notes that both ICAO and the International MaritimeOrganization (IMO) publish documents containing emergency response informationwhich could be used to satisfy the written emergency response informationrequirements specified in this final rule, when used in conjunction witha properly prepared shipping paper.With regard to providing a 24-hour emergency response telephone number,the Hazardous Materials Advisory Council (HMAC) strongly urged RSPA torequire foreign shippers that ship hazardous materials into the UnitedStates to designate a representative in the U.S., and to ensure that thecontact is supplied with sufficient emergency response information to adequatelyassist emergency responders. Other commenters, such as the Air TransportAssociation of America and the International Air Transport Association(IATA) were concerned that overseas telephone numbers would be of littleuse in an emergency in the U.S., and that there could be some difficultyin obtaining emergency response information for import shipments of hazardousmaterials. RSPA has similar concerns regarding the effectiveness of anoverseas 24-hour emergency response telephone number contact for foreignshippers. Although HMAC's proposal to require that foreign shippers designatea representative in the U.S. appears to have merit, it is beyond the scopeof this rulemaking. RSPA anticipates addressing this issue in future rulemaking.Until that time, the emergency response information requirements of thisfinal rule apply to all shippers of hazardous materials. Accordingly, theappropriate sections of the HMR, andSection;andSection; 171.11, and 171.12a,have been revised to require that import shipments of hazardous materials,subject to the provisions of these sections, must conform to the requirementsfor emergency response information as prescribed in Subpart G of Part 172of this subchapter.<T3>Applicability of the emergency response information requirements toCanadian shipments of hazardous materials. </T3>The requirements underandSection; 171.12a allow hazardous materials shipments from Canada to betransported in the United States, which are transported in accordance withthe Canadian ``Transport of Dangerous Goods Regulations'' (TDG). The TDGregulations contain requirements for the use of certain emergency responseinformation for shipments of hazardous materials. The requirements forcompletion of the ``Emergency Response Form'' are set out in the Canadian``Regulations for the Transportation of Dangerous Commodities by Rail.''However, the Canadian ``Emergency Response Form'' only applies to carload,trailerload, truckload or containerload quantities of hazardous materialstransported by rail. These Canadian requirements do not, in all instances,fulfill the requirements specified in this final rule. Therefore, andSection;171.12a has been revised by the addition of paragraph (a)(7) which requirescompliance with the emergency response information provisions of SubpartG of Part 172.<T3>Applicability of emergency response information requirements to emptypackagings. </T3>The requirements under 49 CFR 173.29, for empty packagingsthat contain any residue of a hazardous material, specify that unless apackaging is cleaned and purged of all residue, or filled with materialsnot regulated under 49 CFR, it must be transported in the same manner asrequired when it previously contained a greater quantity of hazardous materials.This provision also applies to conformance with emergency response informationrequirements.<T3>Requests for public hearing. </T3>Three commenters, the ATA, the RegularCommon Carrier Conference (RCCC), and the International Association ofFire Fighters (IAFF) requested that RSPA conduct a public hearing on themerits of the proposals contained in the NPRM. ATA and RCCC requested ajoint hearing with DOT and OSHA to address the nature and extent of hazardousmaterials incidents in the trucking industry and the information necessaryto protect employees and others in the event of such incidents. ATA stated:<ITAG tagnum="21">(t)his hearing will allow both agencies to hear from the affectedindustries and to better understand the conflict which will arise as aresult of the lack of delineation of regulatory authority of the two agencies.It would also provide DOT and OSHA with the opportunity to hear suggestionswhich could help to promote national uniformity and increased safety throughpractical and a realistic communication standard.</ITAG>RSPA conducted a public hearing on certain aspects of this rulemaking actionafter issuance of the ANPRM. Comments received during the hearing and thecomment period on the ANPRM generally supported the proposal to requirethat additional emergency response information be included on the shippingpaper, such as a 24-hour emergency response information telephone number,and additional shipping descriptions. A majority of the commenters supportedthe use of the ERG as the document for providing emergency response informationin the event of an incident involving hazardous materials. RSPA receivedover seventy responses to the ANPRM. Based on the responses received tothe ANPRM, RSPA issued an NPRM proposing specific regulatory requirementsdealing with emergency response communications. In response to the NPRM,more than seventy comments were received and evaluated. Furthermore, commentsto other pending rulemaking actions, such as Docket HM-181, dealing withsimilar topics addressed in this rulemaking (ie., additional requirementsfor technical names for n.o.s. descriptions), were evaluated. RSPA doesnot believe that a public hearing on the proposals contained in the NPRMwould have provided substantive additional information beyond the commentsalready received, evaluated, and discussed in responses to the ANPRM andNPRM.In specific response to the ATA and RCCC request, RSPA fully appreciatesthe necessity for uniform and non-conflicting requirements, to the maximumextent possible, between various agencies of the Government. In order toprovide compliance flexibility, thereby limiting the potential for duplicativeor conflicting requirements, RSPA has not required a specific form or documentwhich would be necessary in order to comply with the requirements of thisfinal rule. Emergency response information must be in a form or documentthat permits reference to the hazardous materials being shipped and provideguidance relative to the hazards, risks, precautions and mitgation methodsnecessary. This information can be transmitted using an MSDS, the ERG,or any other document that provides the information prescribed.ATA also expressed concern about the potential overlap of DOT and OSHAregulations and suggested a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to delineaterespective authorities. RSPAaagrees that it should coordinate with OSHAofficials on a continuing basis, but a formal MOU only could constitutean agreement to coordinate interagency activities. Matters related to resolutionof jurisdictional issues (e.g., the meaning of the ``exercise'' provisionof the Occupational Safety and Health Act; 29 U.S.C. 653(b)(1)) must behandled in the manner specified by law (e.g., review and decision by theOccupational Safety and Health Review Commission). In order to facilitateinteragency coordination, RSPA solicits information on hazardous materialsissues that should be discussed with OSHA officials on an ongoing basis.The IAFF also requested that a public hearing be held regarding the proposalscontained in the NPRM and, in addition, stated the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">The IAFF strongly disagrees with the position of the DOT that materialsafety data sheets (MSDSs) not be provided and maintained in those locationsas required in 172.600(a). We believe that the MSDS, the primary vehiclefor transmitting chemical information, should be required and availablefor use by fire fighting and other emergency response personnel duringa hazardous materials emergency. We believe that the reasons provided bythe DOT in the Notice of Proposed Rulemaking are not only based on specialinterest (industry and/or those being regulated) but are significantlyrhetorical and unsubstantiated. While we agree that MSDS were not <T3>originally</T3> developed for the purpose of providing informationfor emergency response, they are now in fact the most utilized vehiclefor providing such information. As you are well aware, the Federal HazardCommunication Standard, most State Right-to-Know standards, SARA and manyother federal, state and local regulations require the utilization of theMSDS. Fire fighters and emergency response personnel utilize this informationat fixed facilities and would obviously be able to utilize this informationequally as well when responding to transportation incidents.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">We also strongly disagree with the proposal that the DOT EmergencyResponse Guidebook be used to satisfy the proposed requirements. The DOTERG has never had public review other than through an ``unofficial'' andvery unbalanced advisory committee. If the ERG is to be utilized, we proposethat it receive full review in accordance with the Administrative ProceduresAct. Accordingly, we also do not agree with the allowance of the use ofthe CHEMTREC telephone to satisfy the requirements of 172.604, especiallywithout further definition of what ``accepting responsibility for'' wouldmean and without public review of the CHEMTREC operation and their legalresponsibilities. If a telephone number is to be included, aside from theresponsible shipper, we propose the telephone number of the National ResponseCenter be utilized. As you are aware, the NRC telephone number is a toll-freenumber that is staffed seven days a week, 24 hours a day. While the NRChas the capability to immediately patch the caller into CHEMTREC's informationand referral service as well as into governmental agencies, utilizing theNRC has other valuable functions not performed by CHEMTREC. Notificationof the NRC serves many vital functions, including permitting federal involvementto proceed in a timely and effective manner. We believe this would greatlyassist fire fighters in handling hazardous materials incidents.</ITAG>RSPA has not required nor prohibited the use of the MSDS as a means ofproviding information to workers covered by the Right-to-Know legislationand Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act of 1986 (SARA). We recognizethe importance and use of the MSDS in providing information to employeesand in planning functions. However, as has been made evident in the courseof this rulemaking action, no single standard exists for the preparationof MSDS to provide emergency response information for transportation incidents.While an MSDS may provide information during an incident involving hazardousmaterials, the MSDS may not, in all instances, provide specific informationrelative to response actions to be taken during transportation relatedincidents. Conceivably, for ``less-than-truckload'' and ``less-than-carload''shipments, a carrier would possess numerous MSDS for the different materialsbeing transported. In the event of a hazardous materials emergency, theymay not be the most appropriate means to ascertain the appropriate emergencyresponse action to be taken. Additionally, a number of different MSDS mayexist for the same material when shipped by different individuals. Informationon these multiple MSDS may in fact vary, thus potentially leading to confusionduring initial emergency response actions. The requirements issued in this final rule are intended to provide specificinformation relative to the hazards of the materials being transportedand provide immediate initial emergency response guidance until furtherspecific information can be obtained from the shipper or others relativeto long term mitigation actions. To date, only the ERG and similar documentssuch as those published by ICAO and IMO have consolidated this initialresponse information into a single, multimodal, easily understood, andrecognizable document directly correlated with identification numbers andemergency response guidance. However, RSPA has not imposed a requirementthat the ERG be carried on each transport vehicle and be maintained atfacilities involved with the transportation of hazardous materials. Rather,this final rule requires that specific emergency response information accompanyshipments of hazardous materials and be present at transportation facilities.This information may be in any format, including an MSDS, the ERG, or othersimilar document, so long as that document provides information, whichat a minimum, provides the description of the hazardous material, immediatehealth hazard information, risks of fire and explosion, immediate precautionsto be taken in the event of an accident or incident, immediate methodsof handling large and small fires, initial methods for handling of spillsor leaks, and preliminary first aid measures. The IAFF asserts that the ERG has never had a public review other thanthrough an ``unofficial'' and very ``unbalanced'' advisory committee. TheERG is not a regulatory document. There is no requirement currently inthe HMR nor in this final rule which mandates the use of the ERG. The ERGwas developed in an effort to fulfill RSPA's responsibilities to providefor a safe transportation environment for hazardous materials, and in aneffort to provide better information to emergency responders in the eventof an incident involving hazardous materials in transportation. The ERG, first published in 1980 and republished in 1984 and 1987, wasdeveloped in cooperation with respresentatives from a number of diversegroups. Representatives include members of the DOT, firefighters, the InternationalAssociation of Fire Chiefs, the International Association of Chiefs ofPolice, The Fire Marshal Association of North America, the National FireProtection Association, a cross-section of major manufacturers of hazardousmaterials, including representatives from Dow Chemical, DuPont de Nemours,and Union Carbide, CHEMTREC and the International Association of Fire Fighters.Each participant in the development of the ERG was invited to present suggestions,recommendations and other information relative to the guidance presentedin the ERG. A number of participants, including the IAFF, presented issuesrelative to the development of information and recommendations containedin the ERG. All issues were discussed and decisions made by RSPA relativeto the final content of the ERG.Since the issuance of the 1980 and subsequent editions of the ERG, morethan 2.5 million copies have been distributed, without charge, to emergencyresponse organizations. Thousands of other copies of the ERG have beenpurchased by others from commercial sources. Such wide distribution hasprovided extensive review by a large audience and constructive commentshave been solicited, especially comments concerning its use in handlingincidents involving hazardous materials. For example, the current editionof the ERG specifically requests such comments and provides an addressto which such comments should be forwarded. RSPA maintains an open logon comments relative to the ERG, each comment is evaluated and an attemptis made to address each issue during development of subsequent editions.The IAFF also objected to the allowance of the use of the CHEMTREC telephonenumber to satisfy the requirements of andSection; 172.604 and recommendeduse of the National Response Center's telephone number. RSPA has not mandatedthe use of the CHEMTREC number, nor the specific use of any organization'snumber. Therefore, the CHEMTREC telephone number, or any other agency'sor organization's telephone number may only be used if the shipper hassupplied the required information, and the agency has accepted the responsibilityfor providing information relative to the shipper's hazardous material.The NRC has generally not been provided with information relative to aspecific shipper's hazardous materials shipments, and usually cannot identifya specific shipper contact, nor has it ``accepted responsibility for''providing information relative to a specific shipper's hazardous materialsshipments. A requirement that an emergency response telephone number beprovided for each shipment of hazardous materials is an attempt to provideemergency responders with more product-specific information relative tothe hazards of the materials being transported. Nothing in the currentregulations or this final rule prohibits or limits an emergency responder'sefforts in obtaining information from all available sources. This positionis in fact borne out by a statement in the ERG which states, ``As a firstresponder at the scene of a hazardous materials incident, you must seekadditional and more specific information about any material in questionas soon as you are able.'' RSPA certainly encourages those involved inresponding to hazardous materials incidents to use all available sourcesof information in order to make better informed judgments on how to handlethem. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Relationship to Requirements Under Other Federal Statutes </ITAG>On August 24, 1987, OSHA published a final rule (52 FR 31852) which amendedtheir Hazard Communication Standard (HCS). The amended HCS requires virtuallyall employers to establish hazard communication programs to provide informationto employees on the hazards of chemicals in the workplace. The amendedHCS recognizes a variety of work situations, including those where employeesonly handle chemicals in sealed containers that are not opened under normalconditions of use (e.g., trucking terminals, warehousing, marine cargohandling and retail sales). Under the HCS, such employees must be providedinformation and training to protect them in the event of a spill or leak.The emergency response communication requirements of this final rule complementthose of the HCS. In addition, RSPA believes that the use of the emergency response informationrequired under this rule, in association with the shipping paper information,will also assist carriers in complying with portions of the emergency notificationrequirements of section 304 of Title III of the Superfund Amendments andReauthorization Act (SARA). The emergency notification requirements ofSARA, Title III, apply to transportation, and storage incident to transportation,as well as fixed or stationary facilities that are not transportation facilities.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV.
