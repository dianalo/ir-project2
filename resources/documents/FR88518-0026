The denial ofthe ESA petition was based on a number of factors, including the size ofthe species' population. However, conclusions regarding the status of thePribilof Island population indicated that it was below 50 percent of itscarrying capacity based on a comparison of current population levels andthose observed in the 1940s and early 1950s.Carrying capacity is the number of animals that a given ecosystem can supportin terms of food availability, space requirements, and other factors. Carryingcapacity can change if one or more of the environmental factors on whichthe population depends also changes. In the case of the Pribilof Islandpopulation of North Pacific fur seals, however, the Status Review concludesthat the carrying capacity of the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean forfur seals has probably not changed significantly since peak numbers ofanimals were observed during the 1940s-1950s.Carrying capacity is the upper bound of a range of population levels knownas Optimum Sustainable Population (OSP). When consistent with its objectiveof maintaining the health and stability of the marine environment, thegoal of the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA), 16 U.S.C. 1361-1407,is the maintenance of OSP for marine mammals. OSP as defined at 50 CFR216.3 is a range of population levels from the largest supportable withinthe ecosystem (carrying capacity) to the population level that resultsin maximum net productivity (MNP). MNP is the greatest net annual incrementin population numbers or biomass resulting from additions to be populationdue to reproduction and growth, less losses due to natural mortality (see41 FR 55536, December 21, 1976).The Status Review found that the population size of North Pacific fur sealsat which maximum productivity would occur is at least 60 percent of thecarrying capacity. Since the Pribilof Island population is at less than50 percent of carrying capacity, it falls below the lower bound of OSPand is, by definition, depleted. The MMPA defines ``depletion'' to mean,among other things, ``any case in which the Secretary [of Commerce], afterconsultation with the Marine Mammal Commission and the Committee of ScientificAdvisors on Marine Mammals established under * * * this Act, determinesthat a species or population stock is below its optimum sustainable population* * *.'' the Marime Mammal Commission (MMC) provided a formal recommendationto designate the Pribilof Island population of North Pacific fur sealsas depleted under the MMPA.Once a species or population stock has been designated as depleted, intentionaltakings from that population are permitted only for research purposes orfor subsistence and handicraft purposes by Alaskan Natives. Small incidentaltakes resulting from other activities may be authorized under certain circumstances.The following MMPA restrictions apply: A depleted species or populationstock is not eligible for a waiver of the moratorium on taking and importation,16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(3)(A); it may not be taken or imported for public displaypurposes and no taking may be permitted in the course of commercial fishingoperations, 16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(3)(B); it may not be taken under the smalltake exemption of section 101(a)(4), 16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(4); however, Pub.L. 99-659, signed November 14, 1986, extends the coverage of section 101(a)(5),16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(5), to depleted species such that small incidental takesof such species or population stocks can be authorized for specified activitesother than commercial fishing; and regulatory restrictions under the MMPAmay be imposed on the taking of the species or stock by Alaskan Natives,16 U.S.C. 1371(b). In the case of the Pribilof Island population of furseals, subsistence regulations have already been issued under the authorityof the Fur Seal Act of 1966, as amended, (FSA), 16 U.S.C. 1151 et seq.(See 51 FR 24828, July 9, 1986). Thus, the NMFS does not contemplate furtherrulemaking regarding Native taking of fur seals as a consequence of thisdepletion designation. Until 1985, management of fur seals fell only partially within the purviewof the MMPA by virtue of section 113. Section 113 provides that the MMPAshall not be considered to contravene the provisions of any existing internationaltreaty or convention and its implementing legislation which applies tothe taking of marine mammals. The exception created by section 113 of theMMPA clearly covered the Interim Convention on Conservation of North PacificFur Seals of 1957, and ensured that the Convention, and the FSA sectionsthat implement the Convention, superceded application of certain provisionsof the MMPA. These views received judicial approval in <T3>International Fund for Animal Welfare v. Baldrige, </T3>594 F. Supp.129 (D.D.C. 1984). Judge Gesell found that the fur seal population wasbelow its OSP level, but that the commercial harvest was not barred bythe MMPA's moratorium on taking as long as the Convention remained in force.From 1957 through 1984, a commercial harvest of fur seals on the PribilofIslands was conducted under the authority of the Convention. The Conventioncame into force on October 14, 1957, and was extended in 1963, 1969, 1976and 1980. Under the terms of the 1980 extension, the Convention expiredon October 14, 1984. On October 12, 1984, the United States, Canada, Japanand the Soviet Union signed a Protocol that, upon acceptance by all fournations, would have extended the Convention until October 13, 1988. Japan,Canada and the Soviet Union ratified the 1984 Protocol. On March 20, 1985,the President transmitted the Protocol to the Senate, requesting its adviceand consent. On June 13, 1985, a hearing was held on the Protocol beforethe Senate Committee on Foreign Relations, but no final action was taken.In consultation with the Departments of State and Justice, and the MMC,NOAA determined that no commercial harvest could be conducted under existingdomestic law, absent Senate ratification of the Protocol extending theConvention or provisional application of the Protocol. Accordingly, onJuly 8, 1985 (50 FR 27914), the NMFS issued an emergency interim rule togovern subsistence taking of North Pacific fur seals for the 1985 seasonunder the authority of section 105(a) of the FSA. The purpose of the interimrule was to limit the take of seals to a level providing for the legitimatesubsistence needs of the Pribilovians and to restrict taking by sex, ageand season for herd management purposes. A permanent subsistence rule wasproposed on May 15, 1986 (51 FR 17896), and a final rule was publishedon July 9, 1986 (51 FR 24828). During consideration of the subsistence harvest regulations, a number ofissues were raised concerning the OSP of the fur seals. In the preambleto the 1985 rule, the NMFS summarized the findings of the March 6, 1985,Status Review concerning OSP, and requested comments on and any additionaldata relevant to the issue of depletion for the North Pacific fur seal.At that time the MMC provided its formal recommendation to designate thePribilof Island population of North Pacific fur seals as depleted underthe MMPA. Four other commenters on the rule also requested a finding ofdepletion. Since a finding of depletion is a condition precedent to regulationof a subsistence harvest under the MMPA but not under the FSA, the NMFSchose not to make such a finding part of its 1986 proposed rulemaking,under section 105(a) of the FSA, and to address the issue independently.As noted by the MMC in comments on the interim rule, the designation ofdepletion carries with it certain restrictions which may affect the interestsof private parties and other Federal and state agencies. Interested partieswere therefore provided an opportunity to review and comment on the proposeddesignation as an issue separate from the proposed subsistence rules. On December 30, 1986 (51 FR 47155), a proposed rule was published to addthe Pribilof Island population of North Pacific fur seals to the list ofdepleted species at 50 CFR 216.15. At the request of a number of NativeAlaskan and subsistence interest groups and their representatives, a publicmeeting was held in Anchorage, Alaska, on January 21, 1987, to accept oralcomments on this proposal. An extension of the public comment period froma 39-day (ending February 6, 1987) to a 67-day comment period (ending March6, 1987) was granted to accommodate the special needs of rural Alaskans(52 FR 4365, February 11, 1987). Comments were received and accepted throughMarch 30, 1987. On September 1, 1987, NMFS received a petition regarding this rulemakingfrom the St. Paul Aleut Community and the Pribilof Aleut Sealing Commission.The petition requested a reopening of the record, an environmental impactstatement, an adjudicatory hearing, peer review, and a contribution toa Bering Sea Scientific conference. NMFS denied the petition on September28, 1987. Copies of the petition and our response, containing specificbases for denial, are available from the information contact listed above.On December 31, 1987, the public comment period was reopened for 60 daysas discussed below. <ITAG tagnum="84">Public Comments on the Proposed Rule </ITAG>(a)<T3> Public Meeting in Anchorage, Alaska </T3>The following individuals appeared at the public meeting in Anchorage andprovided their views and recommendations on the depletion of Pribilof Islandfur seals:<ITAG tagnum="15">Anthony Philemonoff, Tanadgusix Corporation </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Michael E.

Seven speakers questioned the impact of a depletion findingfor fur seals on Aleut subsistence uses. Most felt that animal welfareorganizations would use the depletion designation to force additional restrictionson the Aleut subsistence hunt or force its complete elimination. As oneSt. Paul Island resident put it, ``animal rights groups have shown theirability to manipulate Congress through public misinformation campaignsto prevent action to ratify an international treaty. There is little toprevent these groups from imposing their will on the agency and forcinga totally arbitrary administrative decision to further restrict or eliminateour subsistence rights once a depletion finding is made.'' This speakerfurther outlined the cultural and nutritional significance of seal meaton the Pribilof Islands. He listed a number of major changes that havebeen imposed on the Pribilovians in recent years, namely, the withdrawalof Federal jobs and services in 1984 (as the result of the 1983 Amendmentto the FSA), cessation of the commercial skin harvest in 1985 (as a resultof the expiration of the treaty), and publication of permanent subsistenceharvest regulations in 1986. Designation of the Pribilof Island fur sealas depleted is considered by this speaker to be a final and unacceptableattack on the Aleut way of life. Two speakers complained of implications that Aleuts may waste seal meattaken in the subsistence harvest, apparently in reference to the ``wastefulmanner'' criteria of the MMPA. One speaker said ``such regulatory languageimpugns the integrity of the Aleut people and all aboriginal people.''One St. George Island resident demanded a reevaluation of the facts to``determine whether the subsistence harvest or any activities by the Pribilovianshas or can have an impact on the size of the herd.'' One of the consequences of a depletion finding for any marine mammal speciesis that regulatory restrictions under the MMPA may be imposed on the takingof the species or stock by Alaskan Natives. In the case of the PribilofIsland population of fur seals, however, subsistence regulations have alreadybeen issued and, as stated in the preamble to the proposed rule, ``NMFSdoes not contemplate further rulemaking regarding native taking of furseals as a consequence of a possible depletion designation'' (51 FR 47156).In his opening address at the public hearing in Anchorage, Deputy GeneralCounsel of NOAA, Timoth R.E. Keeney, made the following comments regardingthis issues:<ITAG tagnum="21">There are apparently some misconceptions concerning the effect ofthe proposed rule on the subsistence harvesting. First, let me remind youthat last July, 1986, we published permanent regulations governing thesubsistence harvest of fur seals on the Pribilof Islands. At that time,it was anticipated that a depletion designation would be appropriate forPribilof Island fur seals and that a separate rulemaking would follow toaddress this issue.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In other words, the subsistence regulations of last summer were predicatedupon the probability that this species would be declared depleted. We donot need and do not intend to alter the subsistence regulations as a resultof any designation of depletion under the Marine Mammal Protection Act.A depletion designation should not affect subsistence hunting.</ITAG>The subsistence regulations at 50 CFR 215.31 were promulgated under theauthority of both the FSA and the MMPA. Both acts provide for subsistenceharvests, regardless of the status of the species if such taking is ``notaccomplished in a wasteful manner.'' The wasteful manner criteria was intendedas a cap or safeguard for the native taking exemption and is not intendedin the Act or in our regulations to insult or impugn the motives of nativepeoples.Three speakers representing environmental groups emphasized that they arenot proposing changes to the current subsistence regime and said they recognizedthe contribution of fur seals to the diet and culture of Probilovians.One speaker stated that<ITAG tagnum="21">I want to make it clear from the point of view of the Humane Societyof the United States and for most of the organizations we've been associatedwith over time, including the two that have preceded us, there should notbe in this depletion matter nor in anything else that we've said today,any implication that we are talking about eliminating subsistence use.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Indeed, we have continually supported the rights of the Aleuts touse fur seals to meet subsistence needs and we want to continue to do that.</ITAG>The comment of one of the Pribilovian speakers concerning the possibleimpact of the subsistence harvest on the size of the herd is particularlyrelevant here. Any discussion of restrictions on subsistence take as aconsequence of a depletion finding would include an assessment of possiblecontributions of the subsistence harvest to the population decline. Researchconducted under the terms of the treaty indicates that a harvest of femalesor harem bulls could have a disastrous effect on the already decliningfur seal population. One of the causes of the population decline observedprior to the 1970s was the female harvest, 1956-1968. In contrast, basedon available information, a harvest of subadult males at levels which allowfor the future reproductive needs of the population will probably haveno negative impact on long-term population trends. Clearly, an annual harvestin the range of 1,423 (1986 harvest total) to 1,802 (1987 harvest total)mostly subadult males, or less than 0.25 percent of the stock, could notbe expected to contribute to a population decline or prevent a return tohigh population numbers.<ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Possible Changes in Carrying Capacity</ITAG>The second major concern addressed at the public hearing on the proposedrule was the determination of carrying capacity of the environment forfur seals. Six speakers challenged the NMFS conclusion that the carryingcapacity for fur seals probably had not changed significantly since peaknumbers were reached in the late 1940s to early 1950s. Several speakerspointed out that a number of species in the eastern Bering Sea are decliningin numbers and concluded that the carrying capacity of this ecosystem hadchanged. One speaker gave a slide presentation on the rates of declinefor certain seabirds. He pointed out the coincident declines of red-leggedkittiwakes, common murres, Steller (northern) sea lions, and North Pacificfur seals near the Pribilof Islands. This speaker shared the view of mostAleut representatives that a reduction in pollock, thought to be due tooverfishing, is the cause of the observed declines.Several speakers claimed that the fur seal's carrying capacity had declinedwithin the last two decades due to reductions in food availability andreduced habitats caused by pollution, including marine debris. One speakerbelieves that, although the Pribilof Island seal population reached itspeak 40 years ago, it is now at its ``natural equilibrium level'' witha new, lower carrying capacity. Factors noted by the NMFS in the preambleto the proposed rule, namely relative stability in pup numbers in recentyears, an increase in pup weights and a decline in duration of feedingtrips at sea, are evidence, according to this speaker, of a ``healthy populationadjusting to a new equilibrium level.''Biomass trends for several species of groundfish in the Bering Sea indicatethat major components of this ecosystem have changed dramatically duringthe 1970s and early 1980s. Fluctuations in species populations of seabirdsand marine mammals in this area could be related to changes in food availability,disease, toxic substances, or other factors. If food resources are limiting,however, as suggested by several speakers, we would expect to see reducedmean body sizes, reduced growth rates and higher pup mortality in the Pribilofpopulation of fur seals. On the contrary, as discussed in the preambleto the proposed rule (51 FR 47159), the average body size and body lengthin this population has increased. Pup mortality rates on land are as lowas those observed during the 1920s when the population was rapidly increasing.As mentioned by one of the speakers, fur seals are vulnerable to changesin food availability near the Pribilof Islands during the breeding season.However, any changes in food availability near the Pribilof Islands thatmight explain a population decline of one-third in less than a decade,very likely would be reflected in increases in the length of the feedingcycle at sea near the Pribilof Islands as males and nursing females searchfor scarce resources. On the contrary, however, feeding trips to sea havedeclined in duration since the 1950s. This may be in response to an increaserather than a decrease in food availability near the Pribilof Islands andis consistent with the observed increase in pup weights. Toxic substances,such as heavy metals, are a potential factor in the fur seal decline thatwas mentioned by a number of speakers. As discussed in the preamble tothe proposed rule (51 FR 47159), mortality in seals from toxic substancesin their environment has not been demonstrated despite regular examinationof seal tissues for such concentrations.If changes have occurred in the resources or measurable abiotic componentsof the fur seal's ecosystem that would be detrimental to the Pribilof Islandfur seal population, these changes have gone undetected in field studies.Fur seals, as indicators of current environmental conditions, have characteristicsin common with populations that are not limited by their natural environment.Current pup mortality on land, growth rates, and the variance in mortalityrates on land and at sea are all characteristic of a population substantiallybelow its carrying capacity.In addition to the statements made at the public meeting, written commentswere also received on the determination of carrying capacity for fur sealsand further discussion of this issue can be found below. Two speakers questionedthe pup estimates from the 1950s and felt our estimates were too high.As stated in the preamble to the proposed rule:<ITAG tagnum="21">In view of the lack of complete reliability on the estimates of pups* * * other comparisons can be made to provide insight into the approximatelevel of decline in the population * * * . [There are] several indicators,in addition to pup numbers, that might suggest the current status of thepopulation relative to the apparent peak in abundance in the 1940s andearly 1950s. In 1983, harem bull estimates (down 53 percent), idle maleestimates (down 56 percent), and commercial harvest levels (down 50 percent),had all declined significantly since the 1940s and early 1950s. The foregoinginformation, and preliminary analyses of photographs of rookery space utilizationsince about 1915, suggests a decline of about 50 percent in the population.(51 FR 47158)</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Timing of Our Decision</ITAG>Six speakers stated that insufficient information was available to makea depletion finding and urged postponement of the decision until furtherresearch can be completed. NMFS is unable to grant this request. Sinceat least 1983, annual reviews of the Pribilof Island fur seal population,prepared for the North Pacific Fur Seal Commission, concluded that thispopulation is probably below its OSP. While there exists uncertainty regardingsome of the underlying data, our estimates indicate that the North Pacificfur seal population on the Pribilof Islands is currently below 50 percentof its carrying capacity, based on current population levels (about 800,000)compared to those of the 1940s and early 1950s (about 2.2 million). Sincethe late 1970s, the Pribilof Island population has declined by one-third.Once the Interim Convention expired, and management of the fur seals cameunder the MMPA, an affirmative decision on depletion became mandatory sincecurrent information indicates that the population is below its OSP. Shouldnew, significant information become available in the future, based on additionalresearch and further analysis of historical data, for example, a reviewof this decision would be appropriate. In addition, any future increasein the population above the lower end of the OSP range would be groundsfor removing this population from the list of depleted species.(b) <T3>Written comments on the proposed rule. </T3>During the first publiccomment period, from December 30, 1986 to March 6, 1987, the followinggroups and individuals submitted written comments on the proposed rule:<ITAG tagnum="15">Senator Ted Stevens</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">North Pacific Fishing Vessel Owners Association</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Alaska Factory Trawler Association</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Marine Mammal Commission</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Senator Frank H.

Nine commenters expressed concernregarding effects of the designation on fisheries, OCS oil and gas activities,commercial seal harvests, or the chances of renegotiating the Interim Convention.Most recommended a delay in rulemaking to accommodate additional researchand analysis. One commenter requested an extension of the comment period.It should be kept in mind that the purpose of this rulemaking is to determinewhether or not the Pribilof Island population of North Pacific fur sealsfits the definition of ``depletion'', i.e., is it below OSP? The decisionto be made is primarily a scientific one, and NMFS does not have the discretionfrom that finding on the basis of any potential consequences of a depletiondesignation.<ITAG tagnum="81">(1) Possible Changes in Carrying Capacity</ITAG>Five commenters questioned the assumption, discussed in the preamble tothe proposed rule, that the carrying capacity of the Bering Sea and NorthPacific Ocean for fur seals has probably not changed significantly sincepeak numbers of animals were observed during the 1940s and 1950s. Thesecommenters believe that the carrying capacity for fur seals must have changedbecause a significant groundfish fishery has been operating in this areasince the 1960s, pollution, including entangling plastic debris, must haveincreased during this period, major changes in fish and shellfish populationshave been recorded, and declines in seabirds and other marine animals arecoincident with the fur seal decline.Reasons for what these commenters believe to be a decline in the abilityof the environment to support higher fur seal populations include reductionin food available to fur seals due to foreign fishing in the Bering Sea,and/or changes in water temperature or other physical parameters. As discussedabove in response to the public meeting comments, and also discussed inthe preamble to the proposed rule, we have not detected any effects onfur seals due to possible reductions in food resources or changes in theirphysical environment. On the contrary, fur seals show increases in bodysize and increased pup survival rates characteristic of healthy, growingmammal populations. Declines in numbers of fur seals, demonstrated by declinesin pup estimates and counts of adult males, appear to be the result offactors causing increased mortality of juvenile age classes at sea (See51 FR 47159-47160). Entanglement in marine debris may be a significantcause of this mortality, but other, as yet undetermined, factors may becontributing to the decline, as well.The Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) agrees with our assessment, discussedin the preamble to the proposed rule, that it is unlikely that the carryingcapacity for the fur seal's habitat has been reduced significantly. Thisassessment is based, in part, on an examination of changes in length andsize of individual animals, and duration of feeding trips to sea, whichsuggest increased rather than decreased availability of food. The MMC includedwith their comments a copy of Swartzman, G.L. and R.T. Haar, 1983, Interactionsbetween fur seal populations and fisheries in the Bering Sea, Fishery Bulletin,Vol. 81, No. 1, pp. 121-132. This report concludes that the changes whichhave been observed in the fur seal population do not support the hypothesisthat fur seal carrying capacity has been reduced by fisheries for importantfur seal prey species such as walleye pollock and Pacific herring.Regarding the impact of the start of a major pollock fishery in 1964 withpeak yields in the early 1970s, the authors note that<ITAG tagnum="21">Study of the fur seal diet data indicated that walleye pollock compriseda larger part of the fur seal diet in the 1970's, after the establishmentof the fishery, than earlier, although average pollock size appeared todrop significantly. This trend may have been induced by an increased harvestof older fish. Since walleye pollock are cannibalistic, the removal ofthe older fish by the fishery could result in lower mortality among theyounger pollock stocks, the outcome being an increase in the pollock resourceavailable to both the fishery and the fur seal.</ITAG>While NMFS does not believe that food is a current limiting factor forthe Pribilof Island fur seal population, work is proceeding on furtheranalyses of feeding behavior, diet, and the relationships between fur sealsand their prey species in the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean. Identificationand elimination of the cause or causes of the population decline is a majorobjective of the NMFS fur seal conservation plan.On this issue, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFandamp;G) providedthe following opinion<ITAG tagnum="21">During the period over which the Pribilof Island fur seals have declinedin abundance, commercial fisheries have expanded greatly in some partsof their range. The supplementary information with the proposed rule statesthat parameters such as pup weight and body size of older animals haveincreased in recent years, which shows ``that the ecosystem can still supporta fur seal population as high as that observed in the 1940s and 1950s.''This is incorrect. The increases referred to suggest an increase in <T3>per capita</T3> food availability, but do not show that food availabilityin the environment is still adequate to support 1.8 million fur seals.In other words, if the carrying capacity for fur seals was reduced by 50percent while the population declined by 60 percent, the remaining sealswould experience a per capita increase in food availability, and show thegrowth responses that have been documented.</ITAG>NMFS agrees that the current and historic relationship between fur sealsand the fisheries remains unclear. No numerical model exists to providean answer with any reasonable degree of certainty on the number of furseals that could be maintained by current prey resources. A plausible,intuitive agrument is that the removal of millions of tons of groundfishby commercial fisheries since the 1960s would decrease the carrying capacityof the Bering Sea for fur seals. However, some model results indicate thatremoval of larger, older fish by fisheries has in fact increased the availablityto fur seals of the smaller, younger sizes that they prefer to prey upon.This would have the effect of improving the fur seal's lot. Moreover, wecannot find any evidence of food limitations in individual fur seals.ADFandamp;G suggests that our findings, i.e., increased pup weights and juvenilebody sizes, are not indicators that the carrying capacity can still supportabout 2 million fur seals, but only show a per capita increase in foodavailability consistent with a reduction in carrying capacity. We are not,however, merely comparing findings in 1940-1950 to current data. An extensivetime series of data exists since 1940-1950 on pup weights, length of harvestedseals, teeth weights, pup mortality rates, depth of dives and durationof trips to sea. These data show no evidence over the entire period forcatastrophic changes in food or other environmental factors that mightexplain the loss, for example, of over one-third of the population sincethe late 1970s.ADFandamp;G also pointed out that ``the data regarding the past and presentsize of the fur seal herd are actually extrapolations of estimates ratherthan counts.'' This refers to the method used to estimate the size of thePribilof Island herd, namely, estimates of pups born, information on theage/sex structure of the population and age-specific survival estimates.Only adult males (territorial bulls) are directly counted. These countsshow a decline of over 50 percent since the 1940-1950s and are still declining(1987).ADFandamp;G commented on the population decline rate as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">Extrapolations of total population size from estimates of pup productionmay be seriously biased if the relationship of population size to carryingcapacity changes. Productivity is likely to respond in a density-dependentfashion such that per capita production of pups will decrease as the populationapproaches carrying capacity (K). In a population at or near carrying capacity,the proportion of females giving birth on the rookeries each year willbe lower, and therefore the total population size may be under estimatedfrom pup counts. This factor, in combination with problems in estimationtechniques that occurred especially during the years of high pup abundance,suggests that the actual decline in population size may be less than indicated.Data other than pup estimates also suggest that the population size hasdeclined in recent years, but the actual magnitude of the decline is poorlyunderstood.</ITAG>Work is in progress on St. Paul Island to assess any changes that may beoccurring in fur seal natality rates. At this time, we are not convincedthat such changes as ADFandamp;G suggests are affecting population size estimates.As discussed earlier, in addition to pup estimates, the magnitude of thepopulation decline can be estimated from photographs of rookery space utilizationsince about 1915, direct harem bull counts (down 53 percent) and idle maleestimates (down 56 percent).Another commenter provided his opinion that ``the North Pacific fur sealis not presently depleted.'' According to this commenter the fur seal ``maynow be below 50 percent of the maximum population size that occurred inthe 1940's and 1950's. It is not 50 percent below the long term carryingcapacity for fur seals.'' The commenter states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The key issue is whether the large size of the population in the 1940'sand early 1950's is a valid ``benchmark'' on which to make a determinationabout carrying capacity of the marine environment that supports fur seals.In my opinion the high numbers of the late 1940's and early 1950's werea short term anomaly which resulted from the rapid recovery of a populationreduced to very low numbers in the 1910-1918 period. I seriously doubtthat such a population size can ever again be reached <T3>except </T3>through the same mechanism of recovery from very low numbersresulting from severe exploitation or unusual natural calamity. In eithercase the maximum attainable population size can not be maintained for longin nature.</ITAG>This commenter notes two examples of ``artificially high populations thatexist for a short period of time'', Weddell seals in McMurdo Sound, Antarcticaand Pacific walrus. According to this commenter, the pre-exploitation sizeof the Weddell seal population was about 2,000. This population was greatlyreduced by harvesting and subsequently increased to 3,000 and has sincedeclined to less than 2,000. In this commenter's opinion, a parallel situationis underway with Pacific walruses, where peak numbers observed in 1978-82``were not sustainable over time.'' It is the opinion of NMFS, however,that the population of North Pacific fur seals in the 1940s-1950s was notan artificially high, peak level that is not sustainable over time. Indeed,the maximum numbers and relative stability, as evidenced by direct bullcounts, lasted almost 20 years. This high population level was ended bythe large harvests of female seals in the late 1950s-1960s. The effectof the female harvest should have passed through the population by themid-late 1970s, and the population could by that time have begun to returnto high levels. In our view, by the mid-1970s another factor or factorshad begun to increase mortality of, especially, juvenile age classes. Thecause of this mortality is not yet completely understood.The MMPA does not require that marine mammal populations be kept at maximumrecorded levels, but that they be maintained at optimum sustainable levels.In the case of the Pribilof Island fur seal we believe this level is atleast 60 percent of the numbers attained during the 1940s-1950s. To assumethat the high populations of this time were ``not sustainable over time''merely because they were not indeed sustained due to improper management(i.e., the female harvest) begs the question of the appropriate carryingcapacity for this species. This commenter claims that ``major changes inabundance of several components of the Bering Sea ecosystem'' and changesin the physical environment ``argue against the presumed stability in carryingcapacity for fur seals.'' An intuitive argument can indeed be made fora reduction in the carrying capacity. But, to repeat, we find no evidencein nearly 30 years of consecutive data on the fur seals themselves to suggestthat there are environmental factors limiting the population to current,or lower, levels.<ITAG tagnum="81">(2) Effect on Commercial Fisheries</ITAG>The MMC and the Alaska Factory Trawler Association (AFTA)/North PacificFishing Vessel Owners Association requested additional information on theexpected impacts on commercial fisheries of a depletion designation forfur seals. Two other commenters questioned our assessment of the levelof incidental take of fur seals in foreign and domestic fisheries. Underthe MMPA, permits for incidental taking during the course of commercialfishing may not be issued for depleted species.Six domestic general permits issued by NMFS in 1984 authorize the incidentaltake of North Pacific fur seals and other marine mammals in the North PacificOcean. A total of 25 fur seals are authorized to be taken annually incidentalto commercial fishing operations. These 5-year permits expire on December31, 1988. If Pribilof Island fur seals are designated as depleted, NMFSunder present law may not issue permits for their incidental take, althoughwe know that these animals will inevitably be taken in the course of somefisheries operations.NMFS has interpreted its authority under the MMPA to include discretionto issue permits for incidental taking when populations covered by thepermit will not be disadvantaged, without requiring proof that all otherspecies that might possibly be taken are also within OSP. However, in arecent decision involving a permit issued to the Federation of Japan SalmonFisheries Cooperative Association to take Dall's porpoises incidental tocommercial salmon fishing, a much stricter interpretation of the MMPA hasbeen adopted by the courts (<T3>Kokechik Fishermen's Ass'n, et al. </T3>v. <T3>Secretary of Commerce, et al., </T3>No. 87-5239, slip op. (D.C. Cir.February 16, 1988). The courts considered whether or not NMFS may legallyissue a permit allowing incidental taking of one protected marine mammalpopulation that was above OSP knowing that other protected marine mammals(not demonstrably at OSP) would also be taken. The courts held the permitNMFS issued to the Federation to be invalid and ``contrary to the requirementsof the MMPA.'' This decision may be appealed.In response to concerns about impacts on commercial fisheries that havearisen out of this case, NMFS announced its decision to support an amendmentto the MMPA (See 52 FR 19874, May 28, 1987). This amendment could allowincidental, but not intentional, takings of small numbers of depleted marinemammals by vessels engaged in commercial fishing if such taking will haveonly a negligible impact on the affected population. NMFS is now consideringwhether or not it can reissue domestic general permits for fisheries thatmight take depleted stocks or species for which no OSP determination hasbeen made (See 53 FR 2069, January 26, 1988). Consequences of a depletiondetermination for the Pribilof Island population of North Pacific fur sealswill depend on these deliberations and on potential Congressional actionon MMPA reauthorization during 1988.One commenter suggests that unreported incidental takes could be higherthan expected and states that<ITAG tagnum="21">For example, the fur seal has been one of the species covered in thedomestic general permit issued to the North Pacific Fishing Vessel OwnersAssociation * * *. There are no observers on these U.S. based fisheries,so there are no actual estimates of numbers of fur seals taken. A reviewof entanglement in North American Fisheries (CEE, Marine Wildlife Entanglementin North America, in press) has shown that fishermen tend not to reportincidents under the permit certificates of inclusion. With increased participationby U.S. based fishermen in several of the bottom fish trawl fisheries inthe North Pacific, which are known to take fur seals, the exclusion ofthe fur seal from the general permit could have a significant impact inreducing mortalities <T3>if the prohibition is enforced. </T3>On the other hand, an incentiveof no prosecutions for accidental takings could conceivably be used asthe basis for a scientific observer program aboard U.S. vessels.</ITAG>Along similar lines, the MMC made the following comment<ITAG tagnum="21">It is not clear, for example, where, when, how, and how many fur sealsare being taken in commercial fishing operations in the North Pacific Ocean.Therefore, we consider it desirable to expand research efforts so as tomake those determinations and to identify appropriate changes in fishinggear and practices that would reduce or eliminate incidental take.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Research of this nature requires the cooperation and assistance ofparties involved in commercial fishing operations. Consequently, it isdesirable to include commercial fishing operations in the research program.This could be done by authorizing participating fishery operators to incidentallytake fur seals as part of the Service's directed research program and pursuantto a Marine Mammal Protection Act scientific research permit. Such a programwould provide authority to incidentally take small numbers of fur sealswhile providing important information necessary to assess accurately thenature and possible significance of fur seal incidental take and to determine,if necessary, how fishing gear and practices could be modified to reduceor eliminate incidental take.</ITAG>NMFS remains convinced that the incidental take of fur seals in the courseof commercial fishing is probably insignificant, at least within the U.S.EEZ and territorial waters. We believe the number of fur seals incidentallykilled in both foreign and domestic fisheries is less than 50 each year.At this time, based on observer reports, incidental take in active gearof foreign or domestic fisheries in the EEZ and territorial waters doesnot appear to be a significant cause of mortality and is not considereda likely factor in the population decline. In 1986, only one fur seal wasobserved taken by foreign fishing vessels off Alaska. It would hardly seemworthwhile to engage commercial vessels in research operations when thechances of encountering an entangled animal are so low. On the other hand,should new data indicate that incidental take is a significant or contributorycause in the decline, NMFS will reassess its research priorities to includework on gear and operational improvements to prevent significant takingof fur seals in commercial fisheries.One commenter requested an assessment of the incidental take of fur sealsin the squid driftnet fishery outside the U.S. EEZ. In 1986, a U.S. observerreported the taking of 14 North Pacific fur seals during 30 sets. Therewere no observers during 1987, but the United States continues to seekparticipation in a cooperative observer effort to estimate incidental takeof marine mammals in this fishery. At this time, insufficient data existon which to base any conclusions regarding the actual level or rate ofincidental take in this fishery.<ITAG tagnum="81">(3) Effects on Oil and Gas Development</ITAG>The Department of the Interior (DOI) is concerned that designating thePribilof Island fur seal population as depleted could inhibit productionof domestic oil and gas resources on the outer continental shelf (OCS)of Alaska and possibly California, Oregon and Washington. DOI stated that:<ITAG tagnum="21">A depletion designation may inhibit OCS leasing and permitting activities.In addition, the requirements and procedures for obtaining permits underthe MMPA for small incidental but unintentional taking of fur seals wouldpresumably apply to OCS operators. We are concerned that designation ofthe population as depleted may have an effect on the ability of those operatorsto plan their activities and obtain incidental take permits or meet permitrequirements. For example, offshore Alaska, depletion designation may lendcredence to a perceived need for a leasing-and/or activity-free bufferzone around the Pribilof Islands. This could complicate the use of thePribilofs as a support base for Bering Sea OCS activities. Increased industrycosts associated with any potential new restrictions or permit requirementscannot be accurately predicted at this time.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">In areas offshore California, Oregon, and Washington, a depletiondesignation would probably not have a significant effect on the OCS oiland gas program. However, most female and young male fur seals spend wintersand springs in these areas. In the extremely unlikely event that a largeoil spill resulted from OCS activities, unintentional ``take'' of fur sealscould occur under certain circumstances (e.g., oil moved offshore intoareas inhabited by fur seals). If such a circumstance arose and takingof fur seals resulted, it would be difficult, if not impossible, to determinewhether the animals ``taken'' were from the Pribilof population or thelocal, nondepleted, San Miguel population. Thus, a practical matter ofidentifying impacts to the Pribilof Island population complicates how incidentaltaking could be assessed in these areas during winter and spring.</ITAG>As we pointed out in the preamble to the proposed rule, Pub. L. 99-659,signed November 14, 1986, amended the MMPA by extending the coverage ofsection 101(a)(5), 16 U.S.C. 1371(a)(5), to depleted species. Small incidentaltakes of depleted species or population stocks can be authorized for specifiedactivities other than commercial fishing, including OCS oil and gas development.The findings needed to satisfy 101(a)(5) are the same whether the populationis depleted or not. However, any significant taking from the populationwould require a waiver of the moratorium. A depleted species is not eligiblefor a waiver. Thus, if large numbers of fur seals are expected to be takenin the course of oil and gas development offshore Alaska, California, Oregon,or Washington the depletion designation will foreclose the possibilityof a waiver of the MMPA's moratorium to accommodate any significant takingfor this purpose.In addition, the DOI wants to clarify that the FWS did not recommend thatthe North Pacific fur seal population be designated as depleted (as statedin the preamble to the proposed rule), but rather supported initiationof the formal designation process. DOI further recommends that additionalanalysis be done concerning the determination of carrying capacity forfur seals. <ITAG tagnum="81">(4) Effect on Subsistence Taking </ITAG>Three commenters addressed the possible effect of a depletion designationon subsistence rights. One commenter stated that ``it is imperative thatshould a finding of depletion be warranted, thorough discussion of theimpacts of such a finding on the existing subsistence regulations be includedin the final decision.'' As stated at length earlier during discussionof the public meeting, the NMFS does not intend to alter the subsistencerule as a consequence of the depletion finding. As another commenter putit ``a depletion designation does not create any basis to reopen rulemakingor reexamine subsistence harvest regulation.'' A third commenter ``supportsthe existing approach to regulation of the fur seal harvest, and does notadvocate any further restrictions of this important subsistence right.''<ITAG tagnum="81">(5) Effect on Ratification of the Convention </ITAG>Four commenters suggested that a depletion designation would have an adverseeffect on ratification of the 1984 Protocol extending the Interim Convention.One commenter requested assurances that ``if a depletion finding is made,that such a finding will not preclude a future commercial harvest of theNorth Pacific Fur Seal.'' Another stated that ``the NMFS and the U.S. Senatecan do more to help the North Pacific Fur Seal by working to ratify theTreaty as quickly as possible, then it has over the past three years whiletrying to appease animal protection groups.'' However, this commenter will``support a Treaty that suspends the commercial harvest until the NorthPacific Fur Seals have reached sustainable numbers.'' Another commenterbelieves that depletion ``will indubitably aid those who object to therenewal of the Interim Convention * * *.'' The fourth commenter believesthat ``the depletion proposal is an ill-supported expedient to employ theMarine Mammal Protection Act in the absence of Treaty extension at therisk of reducing the present fur seal population.'' This commenter believeswe have failed to discuss ``the effects of the failure of the U.S. Senateto ratify the extension of the North Pacific Fur Seal Treaty and consequentcommecial pelagic sealing.'' As discussed above, the 1984 protocol to the Interim Convention has notbeen ratified. In 1985, in consultation with the Department of State (DOS),the Department of Justice, and the MMC, NOAA determined that no commercialharvest of fur seals could be conducted under existing domestic law (i.e.,the MMPA and the FSA) without Senate ratification or provisional applicationof the protocol. The protocol was submitted to the Senate for its advice and consent toratification in March 1985. The DOS received a letter in April 1985 signedby 44 Senators stating their opposition to the protocol. This precludedany chance of achieving the two-thirds majority needed for ratification.The opposition to the protocol was based on objections to the commercialharvest provision of the Convention. Unlike domestic law, the treaty allowedthe continuation of the commercial harvest despite the decline in the furseal population. In 1986, DOS renewed its request for favorable consideration of the protocol.The staff of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee recanvassed the oppositionand found that it remained unchanged. The Senate will not give its adviceand consent to ratification of the 1984 protocol, and, consequently, theInterim Convention is no longer in effect. Consultations are planned, however,with former parties to the Convention on the possibility of a new agreementthat would extend the pelagic sealing ban and continue international researchcoordination on fur seals. No commercial harvests are possible on the PribilofIslands while this population remains below OSP. <ITAG tagnum="81">(6) Status under the ESA</ITAG>One commenter that supports the depletion designation also encourages NMFS``to reconsider its decision and list the fur seal as a threatened species''under the ESA. As mentioned above, our decision not to list the PribilofIsland population as threatened was based on a number of factors, includingthe current size of the population. In our view this species' populationof about 1 million is probably not at or near a critical level that couldlead to extinction in the foreseeable future. In the early 1900s, the speciesreached levels as low as 300,000 and was still able to rebound to numbersas high as 2-3 million. As this commenter points out, one of the basesof our decision was the fact that this species was the subject of an internationaltreaty that prohibited pelagic harvesting, encouraged international researchcooperation, and placed limits on harvests of this species on land. Weconsidered that a mechanism was already in place for the conservation andrecovery of this species to higher levels.Since our 1985 ESA decision, the treaty has lapsed and the species hascome under the purview of the MMPA. The FSA and the MMPA are now the regulatoryauthority for a subsistence harvest on the Pribilof Islands. Further restrictionson taking from the Pribilof Island stock will be imposed as a result ofthis depletion designation, i.e., no permits will be issued for incidentaltake or public display. The subsistence regime, and the depletion designation,should provide an adequate regulatory mechanism for the recovery of thePribilof Island stock. The NMFS will, however, consider the fur seal foran ESA candidate species list that is currently under development. Continueddeclines in species populations will result in periodic reconsiderationof an ESA listing.<ITAG tagnum="81">(7) Conservation Planning and Other Issues</ITAG>Four of the commenters who supported a depletion designation urged immediateaction on recovery of the species. One commenter noted that:<ITAG tagnum="21">Common sense and public policy demand that in the face of a 4 to 8%annual decline in a population already reduced to below 60% of its OSP,resource managers must act quickly to stop the decline and take measuresto restore the population. In today's world of competing demands for marineresources, and increasing pressures for development in marine and coastalhabitats, it is a given that man's activities will continue, inevitably,to alter the carrying capacity of our oceans for marine life. The argumentthat the agency use ``diminished carrying capacity'' as a method to avoidmaking a strictly numerical depletion finding begs the question of whether,faced with a significantly reduced and declining population, resource managerssimply revise the ``bottom line.'' Such an approach is counter to the intentand purpose of the Marine Mammal Protection Act.</ITAG>Another commenter states that ``we understand that the agency, as is customaryin the scientific community feels compelled to accompany its referencesto research results and conclusions about the fur seal population withappropriate qualifiers. Nonetheless, neither the agency nor the publicshould harbor any doubts about the strength of the evidence that the NorthPacific Fur Seal is in jeopardy and is suffering a severe decline in population,due especially to entanglement in ocean debris.'' This commenter furthernoted that ``we support the agency's decision to formally designate thispopulation as depleted. This step, long appropriate and too long delayed,we hope, signals NMFS' renewed commitment to take <T3>all</T3> regulatory and enforcement measures necessary to protect theNorth Pacific Fur Seal.''A third commenter believes ``it is the responsibility of the NMFS to takeimmediate corrective measures to ensure the population will recover. Afterthe final determination that the population is depleted, we look forwardto the timely receipt of proposals to replenish the population of the PribilofIsland stock of Northern fur seals, as the preliminary step to the NMFSfulfillment of their obligation under the law.'' The fourth commenter onthis issue recommends that ``the most sensible way to approach the decliningfur seal population is to give it protection while seeking to ascertainthe exact reasons for the decline. Designation as depleted will be a properinitial step.'' This commenter further suggests that ``monitoring of thefur seal population continue through observation and nondisruptive censusingmethods. In addition, we urge that all possible steps to minimize continuingentanglement of fur seal in netting and plastic debris be implemented.''NMFS is preparing a conservation plan for fur seals that will be availablefor public review later this year. The conservation plan will have as itsgoal the recovery of the Pribilof Island population to OSP. The plan'sobjectives will include (1) the identification and elimination or mitigationof the cause(s) of the population decline; (2) monitoring population trendsto ensure that fur seals remain a significant functioning element in theirecosystem; and (3) actions needed to minimize adverse effects on fur sealsand their habitats from man's activities. Research, public education, andindustry assistance on the entanglement problem will be significant elementsin our plan. The existing subsistence harvest regime, this depletion designation,and the development and implementation of a conservation plan for the PribilofIsland fur seals provide a coordinated program of conservation effortsthat should lead to a recovery of this population to more productive andsustainable levels.One commenter also recommended that we assess the status of other NorthPacific fur seal populations and begin a review of the status of the Stellersea lion under the MMPA. We do not have sufficient data, at this time,on historic trends in populations of North Pacific fur seals under Sovietjurisdiction to provide accurate assessments of the current status of thesepopulations. Historically, the Pribilof Island population, by number, hasrepresented about three-fourths of the species. On April 24, 1987, NMFSannounced its intention to prepare a report on the population status ofSteller sea lions to determine abundance and trends (52 FR 13743). Theresultant report, entitled ``Status Review, Northern (Steller) Sea Lion(<T3>Eumetopias jubatus</T3>) in Alaska'' (January 1988), concludes thatthe number of adult and juvenile sea lions observed on rookeries in southwestAlaska declined about 52 percent from at least 140,000 in 1956-60 to about68,000 in 1985. Copies of this report are available from the informationcontact noted above. (c) <T3>Reopening of the public comment period. </T3>NMFS reopened the publiccomment period on the proposed rule for a 60-day period, ending February29, 1988, to consider additional information on possible changes in thecarrying capacity of the Bering Sea ecosystem (52 FR 49450, December 31,1987). Biomass trends for red king crab and several species of groundfishin the Bering Sea were presented to demonstrate that changes have occurredin important components of this ecosystem during the 1970s and early 1980s(See 52 FR 49452-49456). New information was presented that indicates that the carrying capacityof the central North Pacific has changed over the past 20 years. An articlein <T3>Science </T3>magazine (E.L. Venrick, et al., 1987, Climate and chlorophylla: Long-term trends in the Central North Pacific Ocean, Science 238:70-72)reported a significant increase in chlorophyll a, an index of phytoplanktonbiomass, in the central North Pacific. This increase was correlated withdecreases in sea suface temperature and more active winter storminess.According to the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice, this article and previous work by NMFS``suggest one plausible mechanism, a trend in storm activity, through whichthe carrying capacity for fur seals might be affected.'' On December 17, 1987, in anticipation of the reopening of the comment periodon the 1986 proposed rule. The Humane Society of the United States andFriends of Animals filed a complaint for declaratory and injunctive reliefto compel NMFS to issue forthwith a final depletion rule. On January 11,1988, Plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment and request for expeditedconsideration on their earlier claim (<T3>The Humane Society of the United States et al., v. C. William Verity,et al., </T3>Civil Action No. 87-3433, D.D.C.) In association with theseactions, on February 10, 1988, NMFS indicated that a review of the additionalinformation provided in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice did not change the previous view thatthe Pribilof Island population of North Pacific fur seals is below OSPand is therefore depleted. It is possible that a change in some physical factor in the fur seal'senvironment_such as storm activity_could have altered the carrying capacityof the Bering Sea and North Pacific Ocean. However, following a reviewof available scientific information, and based on public comments on thisissue, it appears that there is little or no evidence supporting this hypothesis.Accordingly, NMFS has concluded that no new inforamtion exists on thissubject to warrant further delay on a depletion designation. During this second public comment period, the following groups and individualssubmitted written comments: <ITAG tagnum="15">Alaska Native Brotherhood, Grand Camp </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Senator Fred F.

Arterburn, Willow, Alaska </ITAG>Eleven commenters representing Alaska Native subsistence groups stronglyopposed the depletion designation because, as one commenter states, ``[d]eclaringthe Pribilof Island population depleted would have a significant adverseeffect on the well-being of the Aleut people of the Pribilof Islands. Andas a precedent, it could also have a significant adverse effect on allAlaska Natives who depend upon marine mammals for their sustenance.'' Thesegroups urge closer cooperation between NMFS and user-groups on a conservationand management program for fur seals as an alternative to the depletionfinding. The effect of the depletion designation on subsistence users was the majorsubject to discussion during the public meeting on the proposed rule onJanuary 21, 1987, in Anchorage, Alaska. These concerns are addressed indetail above. As discussed above in section (a)(1), in the preamble tothe proposed rule, and during an opening address at the public meeting,once a species or population is designated as depleted, regulatory restrictionsunder the MMPA may be imposed on taking by Alaska Natives. However, inthe case of the Pribilof Island population of fur seals, subsistence regulationshave already been issued under the authority of the Fur Seal Act. No furtherregulation is deemed necessary nor is it contemplated by NMFS as a consequenceof this designation. A depletion designation for Pribilof Island fur sealsdoes not mean that other Alaska pinnipeds are more likely to be designatedas depleted. This action is not a ``precedent'' for future designationsunless the biological status of other populations also warrants a depletiondesignation, i.e., they fall below OSP.The 11 Native subsistence representatives also stated that ``weak'' or``unsupported'' scientific evidence was used in making the depletion designation.Several commenters mentioned dissension within NMFS on the depletion question.Clearly there has been disagreement on this issue as evidenced by the reopeningof the comment period. Additional scientific information was provided byNMFS's NWAFC to counter the assumption in the proposed rule that the carryingcapacity of the Bering Sea had probably not changed since the 1950s. Thereis, however, complete agreement on the fact that the population has declinedby over 50 percent since the 1950s. The point of dissension concerned whetheror not the peak number observed in the 1950s represents the current carryingcapacity or maximum number of fur seals that the Bering Sea and North PacificOcean can accommodate today.The Tribal Government of St. Paul observed that the notice reopening thecomment period did not reference the information introduced during thepublic meeting in January 1987, concerning ``the reduced carrying capacityof the Bering Sea indicated by population declines in other species, particularlybirds and other marine mammals.'' As discussed above (in section (a)(2)),coincident declines in sea bird populations and in the Steller sea lionwere presented during the public hearing by Native groups as evidence thatthe carrying capacity must have changed due to overfishing, especiallyof pollock. The evidence for a reduction in food availability as an explanationof the decline (or a reduction in carrying capacity) has been thoroughlyevaluated (see sec. (a)(2) and (b)(1)). The robust nature of individualfur seals and the observed reduction in feeding time at sea has led tothe conclusion that food is probably not a limiting factor for this population.The Tribal Government stated that ``[t]here are key gaps in NOAA's definitionof OSP'' and demanded the answers to certain questions.<ITAG tagnum="21">These questions include: (a) whether the term carrying capacity comprehendsmaximum <T3>sustainable,</T3> as opposed to all-time high, population numbers;(b) whether factors such as entanglement, harvest of food species, environmentalcontaminants, or deliberate population reduction programs, are to be regardedas carrying capacity limiters, and if not, whether carrying capacity isa concept intended to recapture an unattainable state of nature, beforeman's appearance on the scene; (c) whether MNP for Pribilof Island furseals can be set, in a peer-reviewed, scientifically accepted manner, asa population size sixty percent of the carrying capacity level. A failureto resolve definitional questions in any rule to designate the PribilofIsland fur seal population as ``depleted'' would render the proposal fatallydefective.</ITAG>Carrying capacity is the upper bound of a range of population numbers withinOSP. It does not coincide with maximum sustainable yield, a concept similarto MNP which is the lower bound of the OSP range. Carrying capacity isnot necessarily the ``all-time high'' population level. Carrying capacitymeans the maximum population level that the ecosystem can support at equilibrium,or the mean number of animals in a population undergoing natural fluctuationsabout the level supportable by the environment. In the case of the PribilofIsland fur seal, the number of pups born during the 1940s and early 1950swas averaged to determine the carrying capacity level (about 555,000 pupsor 2.2 million total population). The definition of OSP provides a rangeof population numbers to accommodate the fact that numbers of animals mayfluctuate between MNP and the carrying capacity (i.e., 1.3-2.2 millionanimals). Evidence for a reduction in food availability for fur seals could,if it existed, change NMFS's opinion on the level of the population representingthe current carrying capacity. Major changes in physical factors, atmosphericor oceanographic, could be evidence for a change in carrying capacity.This was the subject of the reopening of the comment period. However, relativelyshort-term, man-induced mortality factors such as marine debris or othercontaminants would not necessarily be of such a sustained or widespreadoccurrence as to constitute a change in the carrying capacity of this environment.The determination of MNP for this species has been the subject of several``peer-reviewed'' scientific articles as discussed in the proposed ruleand its references (see 51 FR 47160). This subject is further discussedbelow.The Tribal Government asked to incorprate by reference their September1987 petition for a reopening of the record on the proposed rule and othermatters. As mentioned above, this petition was denied by NMFS and copiesof the petition and our denial are available from the information contactlisted above. The Tribal Government renewed the following comments: (1)The carrying capacity of the environment of the Pribilof Island populationof fur seals has declined since the early 1950s; (2) MNP is not sixty percentof the carrying capacity level or the 1950s high; (3) higher mean bodyweights and growth rates, and historically uniform pup mortality and lengthof feeding cycles, would not tend to prove that the Pribilof Island populationof fur seals is not food-limited.A response to these comments can be found above in sections (a)(2) and(b)(1) since these concerns were raised during the first public commentperiod. In addition, this commenter quotes a 1978 NMFS memorandum to demonstratethe change in NMFS' position regarding the cause or causes of the declinein Bering Sea marine mammals and other species. In the 1978 memorandum,the decline in fur seals was largely attributed to ``the development ofa tremendous commercial fishery.'' It concludes that the carrying capacityfor fur seals ``could be considerably less in 1978 than it was in 1956.''It should be noted that the number of Pribilof Island fur seals has declinedby one-third since the late 1970s, and this second, steeper, decline phaseis inversely related to the level of commercial fishing effort, which hasdecreased considerably during this period.The Tribal Government also repeated their comments concerning food-availability,which have been addressed in detail above (see section (a)(2)), and providedthe following ``new evidence'': ``greater abundance of Copepods since 1982correlated with enhanced growth rates in Least Auklets. This indicatesthat primary predator on Copepods_pollock_are less abundant.'' They alsomention studies of murres and kittiwakes and their analysis of foreignshipping logs to demonstrate their strong belief that overfishing of pollockis the cause of these population declines.The Tribal Government is concerned that the ``NMFS staff and no rationalbasis in fact to support its assertion that the Pribilof Island populationof fur seals can attain any given, <T3>higher</T3> level of abundance.'' This is an important misunderstandingof previously published material. NMFS has not determined finally the causeor causes of this population decline; consequently, we cannot anticipatewhen, if ever, this population can return to previous high numbers. Itis possible that this population may never return to 1950s levels despiteall efforts available by law. This is not sufficient reason to fail toact on a depletion designation. The population is below its OSP and thegoal of NMFS conservation efforts will continue to be to bring it up toOSP, i.e., 1.3 to 2.2 million fur seals.Commenters further claim that the use of 60 percent of carrying capacityas an estimate of MNP ``has not been accepted * * * as applicable to thePribilof Island fur seal population. It is based on species or environmentsnot analogous to fur seals.'' In the preamble to the proposed rule (51FR 47160) it is stated that ``[b]ased on empirical information for furseals (Smith 1973) and interspecific comparisons (Fowler 1984b), the populationat which maximum productivity (maximum natural growth of the total population)would occur is about 60 percent of the carrying capacity.''An overview of the literature on population dynamics of large mammals showsthat they tend to exhibit their greatest level of productivity (rate ofpopulation change) at population levels which are close to the mean naturallyoccurring levels (or the carrying capacity of their natural environments).So far, all such populations appear to grow most rapidly (in numbers perunit time) at levels greater than 50 percent of carrying capacity, someat 80 percent or higher. In addition to fur seals, this relationship hasbeen shown for fin whales, gray whales, and <T3>Stenella</T3> dolphins.The Tribal Government claims that the Marine Mammal Commission (MMC) didnot ``substantiate in the record a detailed scientific and factual basisfor its recommendation of depleted status. At any event, its recommendationis at least three years' dated and obscures food abundance issues_in whichit has little competence. Thus, a remand of that recommendation to theCommission and the NWAFC jointly is warranted.'' The MMC provided commentsduring the first comment period in March 1987 that repeated its adviceon the depletion issue (see section (b)(1)). The legal representativesof the Tribal Government and of other Pribilof Aleut entities were providedcopies of all comments received on the proposed rule and copies of thetranscripts of the public meeting. The commenter questions whether or not our OSP determination for the PribilofIsland fur seal population could be sustained in court and attempts todraw certain analogies with a separate proceeding involving an OSP determinationfor the Commander Island population (See a discussion on the Dall's Porpoisecase in sec. (b)(2)). They also state that ``a depletion finding wouldcompound existing havoc for Pribilof Islander's subsistence, its ports,and for commerical Native take of fur seals.'' The Alaska Department of Fish and Game (ADFandamp;G) believes that the furseal population decline in the late 1950s and early 1960s was caused primarilyby a harvest of females and that the decline in pup production in the late1970s can be partially attributed to entanglement of seals in net debris.ADFandamp;G further concludes ``informed scientists agree that they cannotdetermine the present carrying capacity of the Bering Sea and North PacificOcean for fur seals or directly evaluate whether it has changed in recentyears.'' ADFandamp;G present the following explanation for the recent changesin abundance of the Pribilof Island fur seal population.<ITAG tagnum="21">The carrying capacity for fur seals in the early to mid 1950s wasapproximately 2.2 million animals (as indexed by pup production of about555,000). At that time, some stocks of fishes (e.g., salmon and halibut)were greatly reduced, as were several species of large whale and pinnipeds(e.g., California sea lions and elephant seals). When the harvest of femalesreduced the fur seal population, other components of the ecosystem werechanging concurrently so that carrying capacity for fur seals was reduced.The population size stabilized at or near carrying capacity in the late1960s and early 1970s at about 1.3 million individuals (pup productionabout 326,000). </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Entanglement in net debris, which began to increase in 1970 and peakedin 1975, caused a density independent mortality that reduced the populationsomewhat below carrying capacity. Using measures of average pup productionon St. Paul Island for 1964-1976 (264,478) and 1980-1987 (180,715), weestimate that the present population is above 68 percent of the most recent(early 1970s) carrying capacity level. The population therefore is abovethe generally accepted level which produces MNPL, and does not qualifyfor classification as depleted under the terms of the NMPA.</ITAG>NMFS has concluded, based on the same data, that the Pribilof Island populationis a less than 60 percent of the carrying capacity observed during the1940s-1950s. The commercial harvest of females during 1956-68 cannot beconsidered to have permanently reduced the carrying capacity of this environment.Using ADFandamp;G's logic, the current situation (800,00 population) couldrepresent a second reduction in carrying capacity caused by debris entanglementand associated with coincident declines in Steller sea lions and seabirds.On the contrary, carrying capacity is not a sliding index of current populationsize. ADFandamp;G recommends against a depletion designation because ``designatingthe population as depleted would needlessly limit the options availablefor managing fur seals, would affect management of other valuable marineresources, and could substantially impact the lives of Alaskans on thePribilof Islands and elsewhere.''Another commenter questioned the assumption that the carrying capacityhas probably not changed since the 1950s.<ITAG tagnum="21">First and most obvious, the fishery resources_bottom fish, shellfish,finfish, and all species in between_have been the subject of all time highexploitation effort during the years since World War II. Fishermen havebecome more plentiful, more productive and more thorough about using theresources. Whole fisheries in the fur seal migratory area have come andgone during this period, such as king crab in the Pribilof area, and theshrimp fishery. Halibut in the Bering Sea have declined and returned inthis period.</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">Based on his experience with the North Pacific Fishery ManagementCouncil, this commenter believes that reliable resource assessment in theBering Sea is ``a near impossibility'' because of the existence of theunclaimed ``donut hole'' which raises doubts about the abundance of resources.He believes we must ``address the Bering Sea as one ecosystem.'' He feelsthat the depletion designation ``ought not to be made before the entireintent and purpose of NMPA is reexamined by the Congress this year.''The International Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies (IAFWA) renewedits concern about the NMFS' ``ill supported expedient to employ the MarineMammal Protection Act in the absence of a Treaty extension for North PacificFur Seals.'' This subject was addressed in section (a)(5) above. IAFWAalso endorsed ADFandamp;G's comments and ``embrace[s] the hypothesis thatcarrying capacity is dynamic and that the numbers and production of furseals is a product of carrying capacity within the region.''The Alaska Factory Trawler Association is concerned about the impact ofa depletion designation on commercial fishing. The Association renewedits previous comments in light of recent court decisions on Dall's porpoise.This subject is discussed in section (b)(3) above. The Department of theInterior provided a list of publications on the Bering Sea ecosystem thatwere developed in association with outer continental shelf oil and gasdevelopment proposals.Dr. Venrick, the senior author of the <T3>Science </T3>article, discussed above, commented that extrapolationof her results into the Bering Sea is ``Completely unjustified.'' Regardingthe possible effects of climate on fur seals, Dr. Venrick states:<ITAG tagnum="21">The global connections between ocean and atmosphere are such thatthe changes observed in the Central Pacific may, in fact, be accompaniedby climatological changes in the Bering Sea. However, the direction ofthis relationship and the relative timing of the changes in the two environmentsare totally unknown. It is quite possible that winter storminess in theBering Sea decreased rather than increased, or that the change in the BeringSea preceeded or followed the changes in the Central Pacific by severalyears.</ITAG>NMFS had postulated that increased storminess could have affected fur sealsin the Bering Sea and also throughout their range in the North PacificOcean. Female seals and juveniles of both sexes migrate through the Aleutianpasses and along the coasts of Alaska, Canada, Washington, Oregon and California.NMFS did not intend to confine the consideration of a possible correlationbetween fur seal mortality and storm activity to the Bering Sea only, ashas been assumed by this commenter.Four other commenters also challenged the use of Venrick et al. (1987)to justify a reconsideration of the depletion designation. Greenpeace believesthat the results ``cannot be extrapolated to the Gulf of Alaska, the BeringSea and coastal NEP [North Eastern Pacific] regions, where most northernfur seals of the Pribilof stock live and migrate * * * Venrick and colleagues'maps, as well as other studies show clearly that temperature and winterstorm trends behaved differently in the CNP [Central North Pacific], NEPcoastal waters and Bering Sea, respectively.''Greenpeace argues against the assumtpion that storminess may affect carryingcapacity for fur seals. They provide references to support conclusionsthat coastal sea surface temperatures increased and storminess decreasedin the North Pacific, ``SST of Gulf of Alaska and NEP coastal waters increasedduring the past 10-15 years (Tabata, 1983; Xiang and Payer, 1983; Mysak,1986) * * * Winter storminess has decreased along the NEP shelf south of58 degrees N. (see Figure 3 in Venrick et al. 1987) * * *.*'' Greenpeacestates that ``the oceanographic and biological connections between theCNP and coastal NEP, Gulf of Alaska and Bering Sea do not exist in theway the Notice claims and therefore cannot be applied to northern fur seapopulation dynamics.'' Regarding the possible effect of winter storms onfur seal carrying capacity, Greenpeace argues ``[w]inter storms, thoseshown by Venrick et al. (1987) to have increased in strength, do not affectmost females and younger males, since they migrate south to areas wherewinter storminess has actually decreased in recent years * * *.'' Greenpeaceconcludes that ``no claim for a causal mechanism connecting abiotic factorsto fur seal population dynamics can be made at this time.''Friends of Animals/Committee for Humane Legislation commented on this subjectand concluded as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The Venrick research focuses on an oligotrophic environment locatedabove ocean areas of profound depth. The northern fur seals inhabit a highlyproductive environment in the relatively shallow waters above the continentalshelf. These two ecosystems are very dissimilar and the findings made inone should not be applied to the ecological dynamics of another withoutvery considerable caution and substantive scientific corroboration which,as yet, does not exist.</ITAG>Friends of the Sea Otter commented that this ``new'' information ``shouldsimply confirm our inability to predict the future with any great measureof confidence and reaffirm our responsibility to manage as conservativelyas possible.'' They further conclude:<ITAG tagnum="21">We certainly hope this tortured analysis will be promptly put asideand the depletion designation finalized without further delay_not onlyfor the sake of the fur seals themselves (as well as other species whichcould be jeopardized by such a dismal precedent), but also for the sakeof maintaining the credibility of the United States' commitment to marinemammal protection at home and abroad.</ITAG>The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) submitted pleadings andexhibits previously filed in the civil action mentioned above. HSUS commentedthat this material supports HSUS's continuing position that ``the PribilofIsland fur seal is a depleted population stock and that the decision toreopen the comment period was improper.'' Copies of all briefs filed inthis case and exhibits are available for inspection during normal businesshours in Room 803b, 1852 Connecticut Ave. NW., Washington, DC.HSUS submitted as an exhibit the declaration of Dr. David M. Lavigne concerningthe carrying capacity for North Pacific fur seals. Dr. Lavigne concludedthat<ITAG tagnum="21">Our knowledge of this species exceeds that of almost all other marinemammal populations. Nonetheless, the study of marine mammal populationsis necessarily based on estimates, approximations and predictions, sincethe size and behavior of large wildlife populations, particularly thosethat spend a large part of their lives at sea, can never be determinedwith absolute precision. Within the limits of marine mammal biology, however,the conclusion that the Pribilof Island fur seal population is currentlybelow 50 percent of its estimated carrying capacity and, thus, less thanthe population size necessary to produce maximum net productivity, is wellsupported by the available evidence.</ITAG>And, finally, the Center for Environmental Education commented that<ITAG tagnum="21">The supplementary information does not offer the kind of new evidencesufficient to justify the reversal of a long-standing scientific findingabout how fur seals respond to their environment * * *. Hypotheses, asstated in the Supplementary Information, that sea surface temperatures,and food resource reductions are responsible for the mortality of youngfur seals at sea appear to be so speculative that they are not consideredviable subjects of research by seal scientists or the agency in settingits funding priorities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Classification</ITAG>The NOAA Administrator determined that this rule is not a ``major rule''requiring a regulatory impact analysis under Executive Order 12291. Thisrule will not result in (a) an annual effect on the economy of $100 millionor more; (b) a major increase in costs or prices; or (c) a significantadverse effect on the U.S. economy. This rule will have no economic effectsexcept those nondiscretionarily mandated by statute. Consequently, theGeneral Counsel of the Department of Commerce certified to the Small BusinessAdministration that this rule will not have a significant economic impacton a substantial number of small entities. Additionally, this rule doesnot contain a collection of information requirement subject to the PaperworkReduction Act.A designation of depletion in this instance, which is similar to a listingaction under section 4(a) of the ESA, is categorically excluded from therequirement to prepare an environmental assessment (EA) or an environmentalimpact statement (EIS) (NOAA Directives Manual 02-10 Environmental ReviewProcedures, 49 FR 29647, para. 5.c.(3)(h), implementing the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969 (NEPA)). A decision on the status of this populationrelative to its OSP is a biological determination. Once the populationis found to be below OSP, it is, by definition, depleted. Thus, NMFS hasno discretion to deviate from this biological determination on the basisof potential impacts on the human environment. Any regulations or majoractions resulting from the depletion designation, however, would be subjectto the requirement to prepare an EA or EIS. A 1985 EIS was prepared onthe fur seal Convention which includes a complete review of the environmentof the Pribilof Islands, and EAs were published in July 1985 and May 1986to assess impacts of the subsistence taking of fur seals on the PribilofIslands. Copies of these NEPA documents are available from the informationcontact listed above.This final rule does not contain policies with federalism implicationssufficient to warrant preparation of a federalism assessment under ExecutiveOrder 12612.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 50 CFR Part 216</ITAG>Administrative practices and procedure, Marine mammals, Penalties, Reportingand recordkeeping requirement.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: May 12, 1988.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">James E.
