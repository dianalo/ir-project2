Countries where natural gas carsare being used are Italy, USA, New Zealand and Canada, and Italy hasthe longest utilization history of the cars originating in 1930's. Technologyconcerning natural gas cars has been established tentatively, but noengine prepared exclusively for using natural gas has ever been developedand since a gasoline engine is used for natural gas, the maximum poweroutput is 10-20% lower than the case of using gasoline. Besides, developmentshave been in progress in such fields as its application to diesel enginesand lightweight pressure vessels to store CNG, etc., but there stillremain the fields requiring technological developments. The possibilityof wider utilization of the cars in Japan is good, but consolidationof systems for its introduction and legislation is necessary. (2 figs,1tab)</TEXT></DOC>
