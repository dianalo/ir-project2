The chip, which is twice as fast as its common silicon-based counterpart, can improve the performance of workstations or high-end computers by 25%, Gazelle said.    Commercial production of the semiconductor is already under way, according to the company. Gazelle stressed that its &quot;breakthrough&quot; chips are aimed at high-volume markets in the computer field, as opposed to the specialized niches where gallium-arsenide chips are currently used.    Gallium-arsenide chips, because of their chemical structure, are much faster than silicon devices. But they have also been more difficult and expensive to make, and their use has been restricted to ultra-high-speed supercomputers and other narrow applications. Gazelle said proprietary technology it has developed will make its products commercially viable for use in computers that are &quot;shipped in the millions,&quot; and a spokesman said the company expects to have sales between $200 million and $300 million &quot;in three to five years.&quot;    The company's first product is known as GA22V10, a gallium-arsenide version of a common silicon chip called the 22V10, which is made by a number of producers, including Advanced Micro Devices Inc.    Gazelle said the silicon 22V10, which carries information to a computer's high-speed &quot;brain&quot; or microprocessor, often acts as a bottleneck to processing, because of its slowness. The GA22V10, which is twice as fast, offers a solution to that problem.    Gallium-arsenide chips have in the past been incompatible with silicon-based semiconductors, unless accompanied by an expensive &quot;interface&quot; that translated their differing electronic languages. But Gazelle claims that the GA22V10 is fully compatible with silicon chips.    William McClean, an analyst at Integrated Circuit Engineering Corp. of Scottsdale, Ariz., said such silicon/gallium compatibility will be important if gallium arsenide is to fulfill its promise as a material for faster chips. The new capability of Gazelle's chips &quot;opens up a wide market&quot; for gallium-arsenide chips, he said.    While Mr. McClean hadn't fully examined the materials released by Gazelle, he noted that &quot;the gallium-arsenide market has really been in a chicken-or-egg situation,&quot; with prices remaining high in part because they are produced in such small volume, and demand curtailed because prices are high.    Gazelle's chips costs $55 each in batches of 100, a price it said was about twice that of the slower silicon version of the chip. The company, under a production pact with a unit of Tektronix Inc., is currently producing 2,000 chips a month, but a spokesman said production is scheduled to double monthly over the next several months. </TEXT></DOC>
