Separately on Monday, the government reported that factoryoperating rates declined during March, the second straight monthlydecline in the statistic despite a rebound at auto plants.   In reaction to reports that U.S. forces destroyed two Iranianoil platforms in retaliation for an Iranian mine attack on a U.S.frigate, the yield on the Treasury's bellwether 30-year issuejumped to 9.01 percent _ its highest level in three months _ from8.94 percent late Friday.   The rise in interest rates helped depress the stock market,where the Dow Jones industrial average fell 5.81 points to close at2,008.12. Investors were concerned that stocks could sufferdeclines if bond yields continue to rise.   Gold and oil prices rose. Analysts said oil production fromother sources sharply would diminish the impact of any cutoff ofoil from the Persian Gulf states, but they said the market reactedwith typical skittishness at the prospect.   West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed at$18.52 per barrel, up 15 cents from Friday's closing price on theNew York Mercantile Exchange. Contracts for refined products alsorose.

Traderssaid tensions in the Persian Gulf put the spotlight on Britain'sNorth Sea oil fields. The pound rose to $1.9050 from $1.9004 onFriday.   Separately, the Federal Reserve said U.S. factories, mines andutilities operated at 82.3 percent of capacity last month, downfrom an operating rate of 82.4 percent in February.   U.S. factories had operated at 82.6 percent of capacity inJanuary, the highest level in more than eight years.
