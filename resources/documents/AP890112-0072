Foreigners who want to stay in the country for three months ormore will be subject to testing for the disease beginning nextmonth, Foreign Ministry spokesman Gennady I. Gerasimov said.   ``Here, there cannot be any discrimination,'' Gerasimov said.``We conduct tests of our own people and besides, statistics showthe Soviet Union is sharply lagging behind other countries, say theUnited States, in the number of ill people (with AIDS). And we justdon't want to catch up.''   The Soviets once regarded AIDS as a disease spawned by Westernsexual depravity and drug use. One Soviet newspaper's account hadeven claimed the virus was the result of a U.S. biological warfareexperiment gone haywire.   Gerasimov said the regulations were introduced to supplement a1987 decree of the Soviet Council of Ministers.   That decree made it a crime to knowingly spread AIDS, punishableby up to eight years' imprisonment, and said anyone in the SovietUnion could be forced to take a test to determine whether they werecarriers.   According to Gerasimov, the new rules go into effect Feb. 1.Summarizing them at a news briefing Wednesday, he said: ``Foreignerscoming into the Soviet Union for over three months, if they don'thave certificates which would be mutually accepted by agreement,should be screened.''   As outlined by Gerasimov, the new regulations on testing for AIDSantibodies appear to exempt short-term tourists but to apply to allforeigners _ diplomats, students, business people and journalists _who live in the Soviet Union.   As of late 1988, Gerasimov said, AIDS testsof 17 million peoplein the Soviet Union had turned up 112 Soviets who carry the virus,as opposed to 334 foreigners residing in the country.   Eight people have the disease, five foreigners and three Soviets,he said.   ``We do not want this kind of import,'' Gerasimov said. ``I don'twant to say foreigners are a risk group. But we don't take anychances.''   Gerasimov said a traveler who tests AIDS-positive may be asked toleave the country.   ``People who try to avoid medical examination or treatment may beexpelled from the Soviet Union, following a prosecutor's sanction,''he said.   Soviet doctors customarily use hypodermic needles that are thenboiled to sterilize them for re-use, but Gerasimov told oneinquiring foreign reporter: ``Don't worry, we'll do our best so thatyou will have single-use needles.''   Stephen Walker, U.S. vice consul in Moscow, said Gerasimov'sannouncement was the first indication he'd had from Soviet officialsthat U.S. residents in Moscow would have to prove they wereAIDS-free.   The U.S. community in Moscow numbers about 800, Walker said.   Rick Kenney, public affairs specialist for the U.S. Immigrationand Naturalization Service, said that since the autumn of 1987 AIDShas been on the list of contagious diseases which require arejection of an application for a U.S. visa.   Pravda reported Nov. 11 that the Soviet Union had concludedagreements with Britain, Denmark and its East bloc allies thatrequire their nationals seeking to enter the Soviet Union to provethey are not AIDS carriers. It did not say whether the regulationwas already in effect.   Gerasimov said the ``overwhelming majority'' of foreignersdiagnosed as AIDS carriers had left the Soviet Union. The state-runpress has previously reported the departure of African studentsfound to be infected with the virus.   Last year, the official Tass news agency reported the firstSoviet AIDS deaths: a 4-month-old baby from the Odessa region on theBlack Sea, apparently infected by its mother, and a 29-year-oldLeningrad prostitute.   Acquired immune deficiency syndrome is caused by a virus thatdamages the body's immune system, leaving victims extremelysusceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most oftenthrough sexual contact, shared hypodermic needles, transfusion ofinfected blood and from pregnant women to their offspring.</TEXT></DOC>
