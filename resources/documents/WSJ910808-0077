Dick Thornburgh scrupulously avoidedpartisanship at the Justice Department, but as President Bushlooks for a successor we hope he will pick someone with akeen understanding of the most truly political, leastpartisan legal issue, to wit, the Constitution itself.   It is now clear that the largest threat to the dignity ofthe law comes from a breakdown in the constitutionalseparation of powers. Congress has spent a generationusurping the power of the executive branch, in the processcreating a budget system that no longer works, criminalizingpolicy differences via legislators' roving independentcounsels and scaring off the Justice Department fromenforcing the law -- whether the Constitution or briberystatutes -- against Members of Congress.</LP><TEXT>   The natural tension between these two branches has turneddestructive because one political party has a lock onCongress and the other on the presidency. To perform well, anAttorney General needs to have the strength of character tostand up to the Beltway culture that thrives on this tumult,and the intellectual skills to recognize the seriousconstitutional issues at the heart of these disputes.   One of Attorney General Thornburgh's greatest moments camelast week when he accomplished the magnificent feat of makingRep. Jack Brooks blink. As an avid student of the JohnDingell Inquisition Model, Rep. Brooks issued an abusivesubpoena demanding confidential information from theexecutive branch. He insisted on a copy of a legal opinion byJustice's Office of Legal Counsel authorizing the FBI toapprehend fugitives abroad. Rep. Brooks suspended thesubpoena when Mr. Thornburgh insisted that executiveprivilege still meant something.   In fact, there has been a skyrocketing number ofcongressional subpoenas demanding documents over the pastyear. Members have demanded literally truckloads ofconfidential papers from the executive branch on everythingfrom all (yes, all) communications about Iraq to all data onYew trees. Complying with these requests consumes thousandsof man-hours, with little and sometimes no legislativepurpose by Congress. Several congressional committees(unconstitutionally) prohibit executive-branch witnesses whomthey subpoena from bringing along departmental lawyers todefend them.   Congress also interferes with the core executive-branchfunction of law enforcement. Prosecutors now wonder ifCongress will ruin the BCCI cases by holding hearings thatmake criminal prosecutions impossible; remember how Congresshelped deny Ollie North a fair trial by forcing him totestify. At the same time, Justice declines to prosecuteMembers of Congress even after the Ethics Committeewhitewashed the Keating Five.   The next Attorney General will also have to deal with oneof 1992's hot potatoes -- reauthorization of theindependent-counsel statute. Lawrence Walsh, who has nowswiveled his turrets to depopulate CIA headquarters, is thebest argument against these prosecutors, created by Congressto harass selected executive-branch officials and givenlimitless budgets and time. An Attorney General would have totake enormous political heat for leading the battle againstreauthorization, but obviously someone has to take thisinitiative.   On this general issue, the new Attorney General can takehis lead from President Bush himself. He vetoed theintelligence-authorization bill last year because it wouldhave forced Presidents to immediately inform Congress ofevery covert activity; the Founding Founders insisted thatonly the executive branch could have the &quot;secrecy, energy anddispatch&quot; to run foreign policy. He also line-item vetoeddozens of unconstitutional provisions that Congress tried toinclude in bills.   In seeking someone with the strength of intellect andcharacter to defend him in these importantseparation-of-power disputes, President Bush can choose amongseveral lawyers. His White House Counsel, Boyden Gray, wouldmake an excellent choice, as would federal appeals courtJudge Laurence Silberman. Inside the Justice Department,Deputy Attorney General William Barr, who will be the ActingAttorney General, is very familiar with these issues, as isSolicitor General Kenneth Starr. By the same measure, wethink the White House is exposing itself to endless grief andhand-holding if the job goes to someone who needs a staffbriefing every time one of these challenging disputes arises.   Attorney General Thornburgh, who plans to run for theSenate from Pennsylvania, gave the Justice Department a newmorale for waging the separation-of-powers battles.Unavoidably, his successor will have to continue the effortto re-establish the original distribution of governmentpowers, an undertaking that is properly political. Putanother way, the supreme law of the land that an AttorneyGeneral must enforce remains the Constitution itself.</TEXT></DOC>
