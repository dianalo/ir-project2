Both materials appear to dissolve by a nonredoxdissolution process, since the solubilities of LiFeO/sub 2/ and (Li,K)/sub2/CrO/sub 4/ are independent of the partial pressures of CO/sub 2/ andO/sub 2/ over the ranges studied. Equilibrium solubilities of LiFeO/sub2/ and (Li,K)/sub 2/CrO/sub 4/ in the carbonate mixture were determinedto be 78 wppm of iron and 13.7 weight percent of chromium, respectively.</TEXT></DOC>
