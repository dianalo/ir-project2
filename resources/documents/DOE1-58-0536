The method that we propose for determiningthese levels is based on a comparison of a calculated maximum annualdose received by a maximum-exposed individual with an established annualdose limit. When internal exposure from inhalation or ingestion is thedominant dose contributor, the maximum annual dose may not occur in thefirst year following the onset of exposure. Thus, a first-year dose equivalentwill not predict the most restrictive contamination level. An alternativemethod might be to calculate the 50-year committed dose equivalent fromresidual contamination; however, there are no recognized standards limitingthe 50-year committed dose equivalent. Therefore, neither the first-yeardose equivalent nor the 50-year committed dose equivalent is appropriatefor determining acceptable residual radioactive contamination levels.Our method, using the calculated maximum annual dose, results in residualcontamination levels based on an annual dose that is compatible withexisting standards. Equations, which help define the calculation of annualdoses during continuing exposure, are presented in the paper. These equationsand existing radiation exposure pathway models have been programmed intoa computer code to help us further investigate and demonstrate the usefulnessof calculated maximum annual doses. 18 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
