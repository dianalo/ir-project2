(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Grammy Goose met Granny Goose in courton Tuesday to decide an issue that has ruffled a lot of feathers.   Granny Goose Foods Inc. has accused the Grammy Goose BabyBoutique of ``diluting'' the food company's name and logo. Grannyhas asked for a preliminary injunction against Grammy.   Granny Goose, the nation's third largest potato chipmanufacturer, is arguing the boutique in nearby Petaluma hascreated confusion by using a similar name.   The name and logo ``represent the most valuable asset my clientowns,'' Granny attorney Kate Spellman told Sonoma County SuperiorCourt Judge Lloyd von der Mehden. ``Where there is confusion,dilution has occurred.''   Sandy Gotelli, the Petaluma grandmother who owns the baby shop,said she'll be forced out of business if the injunction is granted.She said she picked the name by combining her liking for geese withher granddaughter's nickname for her.   Ms. Spellman told the court the company made a three-point offerto Grammy Goose: to help design a new sign, to help phase outprinted paper goods and to help find a new name that retains partof the current name.   ``We understand she is a small business and we would like tomitigate the harm to her,'' Ms. Spellman said.   She acknowledged there had ``not been a great decrease insales,'' but said the case had resulted in negative publicity forthe corporation.   The judge gave Mrs. Gotelli one week to respond in writing tothe points made by Ms. Spellman. Granny Goose's attorneys then willhave another five days to respond.</TEXT></DOC>
