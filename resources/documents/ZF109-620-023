 At that time, reports Computer Systems News, it looked to save$60m over three years from lower hardware costs as it switched its orders towhat was to become in effect an in-house source of supply.andP;  Instead, &quot;they'llprobably save $60m in the first year alone - not from us but from IBM andAmdahl,&quot; Hitachi Data chief Gary Moore told the US weekly.andP;  Electronic Datarevealed at a closed meeting with analysts that it had saved about 17% moreon mainframes this year than it had expected.andM;FUJITSU, HITACHI, MITSUBISHI HAVE GMICRO/300 TRONandM;MICROPROCESSORandM;Fujitsu Ltd, Hitachi Ltd and Mitsubishi Electric Corp say they have nowcompleted development of their high-performance 32-bit microprocessoroptimised for the Tron operating system.andP;  The Gmicro/300 joins the Gmicro/200and Gmicro/100 and is designed to be used in workstations, personalcomputers, network servers and engineering systems.andP;  It is claimed to run atabout 17 MIPS with a 25MHz clock.andP;  The part integrates about 900,000transistors and implements a five-stage pipeline to execute up to oneinstruction per cycle; there is a large translation lookaside buffer, 2Kbcaches for instructions and for data, and an address monitor function toassist the use of the part in multiprocessor configurations.andP;  Fujitsu is tostart sampling the thing next March, with volume set for the summer.andP;  Hitachiand Mitsubishi will follow on with their own versions after Fujitsu; fasterand more highly-integrated Gmicro/400 and Gmicro/500 versions are planned for1991 and 1992 respectively.andM;OLIVETTI HAS VMARK'S UNIVERSEandM;Olivetti Systems andamp; Networks has announced VMark Software Inc's UniVersePick-under-Unix for its LSX series of 68000 family and Edgcore-based Unixmachines, and will have it under SCO Unix V.3.2 on all its Intel-basedmachines early in 1990.andM;ICL'S ISDN DESKTOP CONFERENCING SYSTEM HITS UK...andM;Following the announcement from British Telecommunications Plc this week thatits ISDN 2 integrated voice and data service is due to start full service inApril (CI No 1,312), and a #23m deal with STC Plc to supply multiplexers forthis network, STC's computer division, ICL, yesterday launched its DeskTopConferencing system for use over ISDN 2 and the existing Multiline IDAservice.andP;  Initially running under OS/2, the system, which was announced inthe US in April 1988 (CI No 940), allows a maximum of eight personal computerusers to share screens and to amend data and graphics in real-time whilesimultaneously providing voice communications on the same line over thepublic network.andP;  ICL, which will be starting volume production by the startof next year, expects early demand to be for a complete DeskTop Conferencingpackage: typically this might include two Intel iAPX-86-based micros withadded memory for OS/2, an AT or EISA interface card, feature telephone, allthe software required, a light pen and mouse and will cost around #15,000.andO;The ISDN components of the system are about #2,000 when bought as an add-on.andM;AS ITS DANISH RC UNIT LAUNCHES FIRST 80486 BOXandM;ICL's 50%-owned Danish affiliate, RC International A/S of Ballarup is thefirst outpost of the company to adopt Intel's 80486 microprocessor.andP;  THeDanish company has an 80486-based model in its RC 900 family of multi-usersystems.andP;  The new RC 990-XE includes a 25MHz 80386 or 80486 processor, ATbus, 8Mb to 16Mb memory, disk controller with look-ahead cache andpipelining, an SCSI host adaptor and VGA monitor controller.andP;  No pricesgiven.andM;QUINDAR'S ALL-OPTICAL KEYBOARD FRUSTRATES EAVESDROPPERSandM;A French company, Quindar SA, based in Cambrai, says that it will startshipping the &quot;world's first&quot; all-optical keyboards next spring.andP;  Use ofoptics means that the things will not emit any electromagnetic radiation andtherefore will be completely undetectable by eavesdroppers, making themattractive for military, government classified, and financial applications,the Agence France Presse news agency reports.andP;  The company claims thatelimination of electrical contacts will make the keyboards unusually reliableand that they are particularly durable.andP;  Quindar is a joint venture betweenFrance's biggest keyboard manufacturer, Pendar Industries SA, which employs180 people and looks for $10m of business this year, and contract researchand development outfit Quintel SA.andP;  Quindar plans to make several thousand ofthe new keyboards next year, and looks for them to generate $1.7m in businessfor the new company in the first year of marketing.andP;  The company gave noindication of prices.andM;MEMOREX ADDS TABLE-TOP MODEL TO 1174 ANSWER TO IBM 3174andM;Memorex Telex International NV has extended its 1174 family of IBM3174-compatible terminal controllers - built around the Motorola 68010 - witha tabletop model, the 1174-10R.andP;  The 32-port device includes all the featuresand has the same architecture as the larger 1174-10R, launched in May. Itsupports up to four concurrent host connections using any combination ofSDLC, X25 and bisync protocols; 3270 and ASCII users can concurrently accessapplications from different hosts and the multiple host addressing bisyncfeature enables up to 128 sessions to be supported, and asynchronous supportfor up to eight ASCII hosts and devices enables the full range of 3270functions to be used on ASCII terminals, including access to multiple 3270host links, multiple logical sessions, windowing and different screen models.andO;The windowing feature supports up to five active sessions from any attached370 or ASCII host displayed concurrently.andP;  The company did not give pricesfor the new controller.andM;INTEL PROMISES RAPID PROGRESS IN DIGITAL VIDEOandM;INTERACTIVE TECHNOLOGYandM;Intel Corp reports that its Princeton operation has developed real-time videocompression to will enable multimedia application software developers andpersonal computer users to compress video footage in real time, and to playit back immediately at full speed and on the whole screen of a computer.andP;  Thenew software, RTV, real-time video, version 1.5, will be available from firstquarter 1990 in a new Intel chip set.andP;  RTV 1.5 means that motion video can,in a symmetrical process, be captured, compressed and played back inreal-time at 30 frames per second.andP;  The new version of RTV uses a newsoftware compression algorithm running on the i750 chip set.andM;30 frames a secondandM;Version 1 of RTV, which began shipping in April 1988, ran at 10 frames persecond.andP;  This new version will ship in the first quarter of 1990 and will beprovided as a free software upgrade to users of the Pro750 applicationdevelopment system.andP;  The current generation of DVI video processors, i750, iscapable of approximately 12.5 MIPS, while the new processor will be twice aspowerful.andP;  It is expected that the third generation of video chips will befive times more powerful than the second generation.andP;  The chips areprogrammable which means that the application developer can control variousaspects of the compressed video or graphics.andP;  For example, the processor canbe programmed to reduce an application's data rate or to improve imagequality.andP;  It can also be programmed to give the power required by the size ofthe video image to be compressed, as well as for the required image updaterate - this being the rate at which the image on the screen changes orupdates from one frame to the next - although it is recommended that a framerate of 30 per second is adopted since this gives a near video cassetterecorder-quality picture.andP;  Finally, the developer can also specify whatamount of the whole available performance is to be used for videodecompression - the data rate, image size and frame rate - and this will varyfrom application to application.andP;  For example, in a teleconferencingapplication the total processing power would be required for decompression,whereas in an interactive CD-ROM application, only half the processing powermay be required leaving the other half free to manipulate the video in realtime, draw graphics in parallel and so on.andP;  Application developers usingIntel's DVI technology have two options as to how to achieve videocompression: first of all, at a development level, RTV enables programmers tocompress video in real-time in the Pro750 application development system orany DVI system equipped with the video capture option.andP;  This is useful forapplications such as networking and electronic mail where a quick turnaroundis of the essence.andP;  It is also of use for &quot;video notes&quot; in applications suchas spreadsheets and business presentations.andM;By Katy RingandM;Another appropriate area for its use is training and educational applicationswhere instant visual feedback and analysis can prove instrumental in thelearning process.andP;  Indeed, Andersen Consulting's Change Management Servicesdivision swears by RTV 1.0, which it uses in personal computer videoapplications to analyse productivity and accelerate learning curves.andO;Consulting manager of the division, Ziegler, sees a plethora of settings inwhich RTV might be useful, saying, &quot;imagine being able to match your own golfswing to Arnold Palmer's, for example&quot;.andP;  Secondly, RTV can be used as a toolto develop new applications, segments of which can then be replaced withproduction level video processed offline at Intel on a more powerfulparallel-processing computer.andP;  In the future, Intel can foresee a time whenan offline compression function will be available on the developer's desktopgiving higher image quality on-site.andP;  Through such products Intel is hopingto standardise Digital Video Interactive, DVI, technology.andP;  As the technologydevelops, Intel is focussing its development skills on the commercial,government, school and home markets across training, design, information,education and entertainment applications.andP;  While multi-media techniques arealready used in training, Intel points out that as DVI uses a standard CD-ROMformat so that it doesn't suffer from a lack of device interfaces making iteasy to port applications.andP;  In particular Intel sees the new technology aswidening the training market within medicine and defence.andP;  In design itoffers a less expensive personal computer-based alternative to videoproduction and graphics computer systems.andP;  For example, an architecturaldesigner can display a realistic representation of a building without havingto build a physical model, making it easier to evaluate different designs andbuilding materials.andP;  Capitalising on its inexpensive personal computer-basedapproach, DVI is expected to boom in commercial and domestic informationfacilities as well as in home entertainment.andP;  For example, DVI's capabilitiesare currently being explored in a pilot application &quot;Design and Decorate&quot;co-developed with Videodisc Publishing Inc of New York.andP;  Using thisapplication, customers in furniture stores can design their own living room,selecting size and shape, furniture, paint and wall coverings comparing andcontrasting them with fabric coverings and room accessories.andP;  The room can beviewed from a variety of angles and changed on command - the commercial hookbeing that catalogue information is available on-line about the store'savailable furniture and fabrics.andM;Estate agentsandM;Another possible application which estate agents everywhere won't be happyabout is the way the technology can be used to show a motion video ofproperties, giving the prospective buyer control of a 360o panoramic view ofthe location.andP;  Aside from curbing the adjectival excesses of estate agentsDVI is also tipped, by Intel, to revolutionise education by enabling thestudent to direct her own learning process rather than being a passiverecipient.andP;  However, whether navigating your own idiosyncratic way roundpredetermined information in a multi-media database is a great improvementover asking teacher is debatable - at least good teachers admit theirfallibility and knowledge limitations.andP;  Such quibbles aside, however, Intelis ploughing ahead with its implementation of DVI and is scheduled toannounce RTV version 2 at the beginning of 1991 which will offer VCR imagequality, while a version 3 should arrive in 1992, promised to be almost be upto TV image resolution.andM;MITAC TAKES COROLLARY'S SYMMETRICAL UNIX TOandM;CHALLENGE COMPAQ WITH SERIES 500andM;The American Mitac arm of Taiwanese Mitac Co introduced its firstmultiprocessor, the tightly coupled 25 MIPS-rated Series 500 at Comdex,aiming it squarely against Compaq Computer's new SystemPro.andP;  The Series 500takes two to seven 25MHz 80386 processors, linked by a Corollary C-Busrunning Corollary's Symmetrical Multiprocessing version of SCO Unix.andP;  In itsminimal two-processor configuration, the 500 is claimed to support up to 16users, expanded to a full seven CPUs, it can handle 160 users, Mitac claims.andO;The system features a dual-bus architecture combining the high-speedCorollary bus, which links CPUs with an AT bus for input-output, enabling the500 to accept existing AT-compatible add-on cards and peripherals.andP;  At itspress conference, Mitac took out after Compaq with a series of comparativeslides.andP;  C K Cheng, Mitac's assistant vice-president of sales and marketing,was quick to point out that the SystemPro was only expandable to two CPUs asagainst Mitac's seven, scored only a peak 40 MIPS against Mitac's 100 MIPSand used the slower write-through cache versus Mitac's write-back technology.andO;Of course, Compaq is using a faster 33MHz chip and offers greater internalmemory: a maximum 256Mb versus only 64Mb.andP;  Its cache per CPU and use of theC-bus, clocking at 16MHz and transmitting at 64Mbytes-per-second, overCompaq's less dynamic EISA bus and loosely coupled architecture.andP;  The series500 also offers 14 slots, six C-bus, five AT-bus and three C- or AT-bus, SCSIand a 500W supply over Compaq's 11 slots, IDA or EISA, and 300W power supply.andO;Mitac says in one-two CPU configuration the 500 will do 6 to 12 MIPS; two tothree CPUs, 15 to 30 MIPS; three to five CPUs, 20 to 50 MIPS and four to sixCPUs, 30 to MIPS.andP;  It compares its cost per MIPS to Compaq's at $1,500 versus$2,000 and tags its entry level cost at $15,000 for two CPUs versus Compaq at$16,000 for a single CPU.andP;  Mitac says it's going to offer the boxes OEM tolarge concerns and sell through its existing distributors and resellers.andP;  The500 goes into full-scale delivery early in 1990.andP;  Mitac also came up with an80486-based Micro Channel machine, expecting an EISA version to follow whenthe EISA chip set is fully tested.andP;  It is beginning full-scale shipment ofits 33MHz 80386 box, the MPC 4000G, and its 25MHz Xenix-based system, theSeries 400.andP;  - Maureen O'GaraandM;ARIX PREPARES 68030-, 68040-BASED THREE MODELandM;SYSTEM 90 MULTIPROCESSOR FOR JANUARYandM;Arix Corp is preparing a January introduction of its next-generation System90, a three-member family of multiprocessor Unix-based systems it designed tomeet the US Treasury Multi-user Acquisition Contract - TMAC - bidspecifications according to president Gene Manno: System 90 will incorporateboth 68030 and 68040 chips.andP;  In keeping with the TMAC specs to lower cost ofownership, users will need to move through only three systems to go from asingle-user desktop system to a top-of-the-line 512-user multiprocessor.andO;Five kinds of peripherals will be supported - read-write and write-onceoptical, CD-ROM - as well as three hard disk formats, 3.5&quot;, 5.25&quot;, and 8&quot;.andO;Software will include the OSF/Motif interface, X Window, and three databases,Oracle, Ingres and Informix.andP;  Cobol and C programming languages andDepartment of Defense B1 level security will also be available.andP;  Networkingwill initially start with TCP/IP and X25, migrating to the OSI/GOSIPspecification as third-parties make it available.andP;  System 90 also figures bigin the company's plans to continue weaning its revenue away fromover-dependence on one large OEM customer, namely Unisys Corp, whose ownearnings are plunging.andM;IXI HAS HIGH HOPES THAT IBM WILL ADOPT X.DESKTOP 2.0 FOR AIXandM;Eager to maintain its frontline position in the battle to supply a desktopmanager for the X Windows System, Cambridge-based IXI Ltd says it has signeda development agreement with IBM for the possible inclusion of its X.desktopproduct in future AIX releases.andP;  IBM was showing version 2.0 of the managerrunning on top of Motif at the recent Unix Expo show in New York, wher it wasdubbed AIX.Desktop.andP;  If IBM were to take the thing, (the main opposition isseen to be Presentation Manager), it would be able to offer a singleinterface across its AIX range, from the PS/2 through the RT and itssuccessor to the 3090s.andP;  Two-year-old IXI, which is 80% owned by itsmanagement and staff, made a $1.5m profit in its first year and has officesin the UK and Boston, Massachusetts.andP;  A West Coast office in Palo Alto,California, will open on January 22, and a Tokyo operation is planned for thenear future.andP;  The next version of X.desktop is set to support multi-taskingand include more adaptive features.andM;DEC LAUNCHES ITS DECMCC NETWORK MANAGEMENT WORKSTATIONandM;DEC has launched the DECmcc Management Station, a network management toolintended for use with a colour graphics screen.andP;  Running the DECmcc underDECWindows with other products in the range, the user can, from a singlelocation, view and manage part or whole of the network and examine thedifferent features of the network by successively opening &quot;windows&quot; on thescreen.andP;  Information such as traffic measurement at a given node on thenetwork is displayed on-screen and individual problems can be highlightedusing a mouse device.andP;  At the moment, the system allows IBM components on thenetwork to be managed as well as proprietary DEC elements; DEC also announcedits intention to supply interfaces supporting the network management tools ofother manufacturers, and to enable the information coming in from thesevarious sources to be integrated into a single database.andM;SIEMENS OFFERS DOCUMENT READING SYSTEMandM;Siemens Data Systems is offering a document-reading system that can scan upto 26,400 hand-written or printed documents per day.andP;  The Allfont 2800 isbuilt around the company's MX 300 Unix micro, and can handle A4, A5 and A6pages - no prices given.andM;CONCEPT OMEGA HAS HIGH EUROPEAN HOPES FORandM;NETWORKED IDOL-IV LANGUAGEandM;Concept Omega Corp of Somerset, New Jersey is making a push towards theEuropean market with a a networked MS-DOS version of its Idol-IV fourthgeneration language.andP;  The company currently derives 30% of its $14m turnoverfrom Europe and believes that this will grow up to 50% in the next two orthree years.andP;  The reason for its optimism stems from its analysis of softwarehouses which divides them into those with a penchant for servers - databasemanagement systems and local area networks, and those whose speciality areclient-based, offering fourth generation languages, report generators, screengenerators and so on.andP;  To Concept Omega's eyes, server-oriented houses suchas Oracle Corp, Informix Software Inc, Ashton-Tate Corp and Sybase Inc areopening up their database management systems for products by client-basedhouses, since, according to Concept Omega, these high-end companies arehaving difficulties satisfying their users' fourth generation languagerequirements.andP;  In fact Concept Omega has no interest in mainframes, and hasbeen active in the DEC VAX and Unix systems market for some while.andP;  What itis excited about at the moment is the growing MS-DOS demand for applicationsthat can be ported across hardware and operating systems.andM;VAX, Unix or MS-DOSandM;For, funnily enough, it just so happens that a developer using Idol IV canwrite applications and port them to VAX, Unix or MS-DOS kit without changingthe applicat-ion code.andP;  Furthermore, Idol IV can be used to develop anapplication on a single-user MS-DOS machine which can then be moved to a2,000-user VAX system.andP;  This is because the new version of Idol-IV iscompatible with the proprietary third generation language Thoroughbred Basic,as well as with multi-user systems running under Unix, Xenix, Ultrix and VMS.andO;Consequently, Idol IV can be used in stand-alone, multi-user and networkedenvironments.andP;  As with similar software products, the marketing stance isthat they reduce the time a company takes to get its applications to market(especially when moving from MS-DOS to Unix), that they give developers moredesign time, and that they enable non-technical industry designers to bedrafted in.andP;  Concept Omega clearly believes that SQL has a role to play inMS-DOS development, since it has also added SQL facilities to its Idol-IVmodule.andP;  Called Query IV, it is Concept's implementation of standard SQL andhas a menu-cursor driven end-user interface to enable inexperienced SQL usersto build up SQL constructs.andP;  Concept Omega's products are available in the UKthrough Romford, Essex-based Professional Computer Solutions and its dealernetwork.andP;  Idol IV is priced at #495 for a single user copy, #1,295 for anetwork version and #1,245 for a full development licence for multi-userconfigurations.andP;  And, versions of Idol IV (which uses natural language) areavailable in French, Spanish and German, as well as in English.andM;CODENOLL HAS BOARDS TO UPGRADE AT-BUS BOXESandM;FROM ETHERNET TO 100MBPS FDDIandM;Codenoll Technology Corp, of Yonkers, New York, has introduced a series of100Mbps FDDI - Fibre Distributed Data Interface - plug-in boards for personalcomputers, a number of FDDI adaptor cards, and a 100 Mbps FDDI ConcentratorSystem.andP;  The new CodeNet-9000 series boards plug into AT bus personalcomputers and support all the major Local Area Networking operating systems,while the CodeNet-9041 Concentrator is used to interconnect minicomputers andmainframes as well as personal computers and workstations using FDDI.andO;Codenoll says that Advanced Micro Devices, Compaq Computer Corp, MicrosoftCorp, Nymex Corp, and The Santa Cruz Operation have announced support forthese new network products, designed for both backbone and workgroupapplications, and claims that they can &quot;provide 10 times the bandwidth ofEthernet at only four times the cost, giving the quickest response time andfastest file transfers available today&quot;.andM;Single slot boardsandM;CodeNet-9540 series and the cheaper CodeNet-9340 series 100Mbps FDDI boardsare single slot boards that connect directly to a Fibre Distributed DataInterface fibre optic ring cable through builtin connectors.andP;  Both the 9540and 9340 boards can connect an AT bus box to a single 100Mbps fibre opticring, and both can be upgraded to enable attachment to dual redundant ringsor dual independent rings with the addition of modular daughter boards.andP;  Thesix different CodeNet-9000 series boards and the CodeNet-9041 ConcentratorSystem can run on the same structured fibre cable plant simultaneously withthe CodeNet fibre optic Ethernet products, with the local net configurationupgradable from 10Mbps Ethernet to 100Mbps FDDI without changing the cableplant.andP;  The CodeNet-954X 100 Mbps FDDI adaptor cards fit 16-bit AT slots andare available in three formats: single MAC/single PHY, single MAC/dual PHY,and dual MAC/dual PHY - a &quot;MAC&quot; being a Medium Access Controller module basedon the AMD SuperNet chip set, while a PHY is a fibre optic transmitterreceiver module based on a combination of AMD chips and Codenoll CodeLinkfibre optic trans-mitter-receiver components.andP;  Each PHY can connect to one100Mbps ring; a dual PHY card connects to two rings for redundancy or twoseparate workstations, while each MAC independently controls a ring.andP;  Themost common single attach adaptor, the single-MAC/single-PHY FDDI ISA board,retails for $5,000.andP;  The retail prices of the CodeNet-95X cards range from$2,800 to $10,000.andP;  CodeNet-935X Series 100Mbps LowCost FDDI plug-in boardsare available in the same configurations.andP;  Apart from the fact that theyoperate at 830 rm optical wavelength over distances of up to 1,000 meters,they are compliant with ISO-9384 and ANSI-FDDI standards.andP;  In the 9340 range,the single MAC/single PHY FDDI ISA board retails for $4,000.andP;  TheCodeNet-934X cards range from $1,800 to $7,800.andP;  A CodeNet-9041 FDDIConcentrator system consists of an AT bus micro, CodeNet-9041 ConcentratorSoftware and a selection of CodeNet-9000 FDDI 100Mbps plug-in boards.andP;  ACodeNet-9041 Concentrator System may be purchased as a kit, integrated by aCodenoll reseller or as a turnkey system assembled by Codenoll.andP;  CodeNet-9041kits start at about $7,500; additional plug-in expansion modules start at$1,400.andM;AMDAHL UK CALLS ON ON-LINE SOFTWARE TO ASSIST INandM;MAJOR NEW EDUCATION PROGRAMMEandM;Amdahl UK's Education Programme, previously under the aegis of Amdahl Europe,is now housed at Heathrow, in the spanking new premises of Axis House.andP;  Thecompany has invested over #200,000 in equipping and fitting the centre, andoffers a broad curriculum that covers the IBM Marketplace, MVS, VM/XA, CICS,DB2, IMS, VSAM, TPF, Communications, UTS, and Capacity Management.andP;  Thenumber of students on each course never exceeds 16, and the students aretaught by subject matter experts either in workshops or discussion groups.andO;The IBM Marketplace is a one-day seminar providing an overview of hardwareand software within the IBM environment.andP;  The MVS course covers MVS/XA andMVS/ESA, and Amdahl says that particular emphasis will be placed on thelatter in view of increasing usage by customers.andP;  VM/XA courses are designedfor newcomers and those already familiar with VM/SP and HPO.andP;  The formertackles concepts and facilities, planning and migration, installation, andthe structure and flow.andP;  The CICS course is designed and delivered by On-LineSoftware International Inc instructors and divided into two sections,applications and systems.andP;

 BlueChip is an information management systems house which grew fat on the back ofthe 1980s construction boom by supplying super-minis to property companies.andO;However, since 1987 it has acquired interests in software packages for avariety of vertical markets including estate agency management, independentschools, service management, and defence industry logistic support.andP;  Duringthe financial year to March 31 1989 Blue Chip made a net profit of #284,000on a turnover hovering below the #5m mark.andP;  Nevertheless as it is stillheavily dependent on the property market with about 80% of its turnovercoming from this sector, it has recently hit serious financial difficultiesand is now running at a loss.andP;  Under the acquisition Blue Chip will become awholly-owned subsidiary of Ferrari.andP;  Its maintenance business will becomeincorporated with that of Ferrari's, but the other parts of the business willprobably remain as a separate division within the group.andP;  Blue Chip will,however, be encouraged to diversify and direct its skills away from thehousing market which is showing no signs of recovery.andP;  The acquisition is fora nominal sum because the vendors are the directors: they are staying withthe company and are being retained by Ferrari under three-year servicecontracts that will be linked to profits.andM;MCI COMMUNICATION IS TO ISSUE UP TO $655M OF ZEROandM;COUPON SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE NOTESandM;MCI Communications Corp is to issue up to $655m of zero coupon subordinatedconvertible notes under a shelf registration statement filed earlier with theUS Securities andamp;
