At a news conference Friday, four scientists on the committeesaid the Pentagon is asking for $300 million to conduct researchinto biological warfare techniques and the researchers said thiswork could lead to the development of weapons for a war nobodycould win.   Christin Anfinsen, a Nobel Prize-winning biologist at JohnsHopkins University, said biotechnology has advanced so rapidly that``the production of biological weapons is relatively simple.''   ``We could develop warheads to spread anthrax (disease) withinsix months and so could the Soviets,'' said Anfinsen.   No nation, he said, could win a war with biological weaponsbecause a counterattack would be swift and deadly.   Army Lt. Col. John Chapla, a Pentagon spokesman, confirmed thatthe military is seeking funds to conduct biological research, buthe said the effort is aimed at developing a defense against germweapons, not at making the weapons themselves.   Chapla said a hearing will be held Monday on the environmentalimpact of a planned $5.4 million biological aerosol test facilityat the Dugway Proving Ground in Utah.   In a telephone interview, Chapla said the Army has let more than100 biological research contracts to private research groups. TheArmy, he said, plans to research defensive measures, such asprotective clothing, and detection and decontamination equipment.He said Army researchers also will attempt to develop vaccines thatwould protect against germ warfare agents.   But he said none of this work was aimed at producing weapons.   Chapla also said that for germs to be used as weapons, the Armywould have to develop a delivery system, a way to manufacture thegerms, and a doctrine for the use of such weapons. He said no workis being done in any of these areas.   At the scientists' news conference, Jonathan King, a professorof biology at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said thesame techniques needed to develop a defense against biologicalweapons can be used to develop the weapons themselves.   ``In an offensive biological warfare program, the first thingyou do is develop a vaccine to protect your own troops,'' he said.   King also said the most serious danger of biological weapons isthat they could lead to uncontrolled contamination of vastpopulations if they are released.   ``Biological weapons are not like gunpowder or nuclear bombs,''he said. ``Biological agents can spread and reproduce.''   Anfinsen said new laboratory techniques, in which the geneticpattern of bacteria and viruses can be changed, makes a defenseunlikely against germ weapons.   ``Since you can make any number of variables, the defenseagainst them is impossible,'' he said. ``The inability to defendagainst such an attack is universal.''   Richard Novick, director of the Public Health ResearchInstitute, said biological weapons are ``neither a threat nor adeterrent'' for major powers because all the technically advancednations can equally develop such weapons.   What he fears instead, Novick said, is that the germ weaponsdeveloped by the Pentagon could be used secretly to assert Americanwill in small countries.   King and Novick said the Pentagon is actively recruitingbiologists to conduct germ warfare research.   ``I have been approached and most of us have,'' King said.   Jane E. Koretz, a researcher at Rensselaer PolytechnicInstitute, said advances in genetic engineering are ``a two-edgedsword.''   ``It can be used to improve the quality of human life or it canbe used for its destruction,'' she said. Using the new biologicaltechniques to develop weapons, Ms. Koretz said, would be ``aperversion'' of the reasons that most scientists conduct theresearch.   She said genetic manipulation techniques could be used todevelop a germ or virus that could spread like small pox.   ``You can understand why we are so horrified,'' she said.   The Committee for Responsible Genetics is circulating a petitionamong university biologists that contains a pledge not to engageknowingly in research that would further develop biological warfareagents.   A day before the news conference, Kathleen C. Bailey, assistantdirector of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency of theState Department, announced that the government believes there noware at least 10 countries conducting research into biologicalweapons.</TEXT></DOC>
