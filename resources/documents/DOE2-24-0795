<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-24-0795 </DOCNO><TEXT>Relativistic models which simulate the two-nucleon system are constructedby means of the one-dimensional two-body Dirac equation, and differencesbetween relativistic and nonrelativistic descriptions are illustrated.The relativistic interaction is assumed to consist of a Lorentz scalarS and the zeroth-component V of a vector; the S is attractive and theV repulsive. This interaction has intriguing features. Unlike the nonrelativisticcase, the nucleon-nucleon phase shift can be fitted easily without assumingthat the range of the repulsive V is smaller than that of the attractiveS. Implications for deuteron structure are examined.</TEXT></DOC>
