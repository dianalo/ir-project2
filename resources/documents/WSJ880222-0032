Gero, president and chief executive officer, said.    In the year-ago quarter, the maker of navigational and night-viewing systems and other military gear earned $408,000, or 10 cents a share. The company expects to report that revenue increased 11% to 16% to between $22 million and $23 million from $19.8 million in the year-earlier quarter.    Also, Mr. Gero said he expects &quot;strong&quot; fiscal fourth-quarter earnings of between 75 cents and 80 cents a share, or about $3.3 million to $3.5 million. In the year-ago fourth quarter, Varo earned $2.4 million, or 55 cents a share. The fourth quarter should enable Varo to post a 12% to 15% increase in full-year net from the $3.5 million, or 81 cents a share, posted for the year ended April 30, 1987, he said.    The big fourth-quarter jump is expected because of missile-launcher shipments due during the quarter, Mr. Gero said, and increased production efficiency in its Army contract for night vision equipment. Also, the company's strategy to expand its sales to foreign governments is starting to pay off, Mr. Gero said.    The likelihood that the federal defense budget won't increase in coming years, and may well decline, won't hurt Varo as much as other contractors since Varo concentrates on defense electronics, Mr. Gero said. &quot;That segment is expected to continue to grow, but just not as fast as it has been.&quot;    Further, he said, Varo should get a boost from the treaty on intermediate-range nuclear forces signed by the U.S. and Russia. &quot;The treaty has placed emphasis on conventional weapons and readiness, and that's the business we're in,&quot; Mr. Gero said. &quot;Equally important is Europe's need to improve its combat readiness, so we should see more business out of NATO countries.&quot;    The company is currently negotiating with two North Atlantic Treaty Organization countries for joint ventures that would give Varo plants in some of those countries. Mr. Garo declined to identify the countries. He said Varo is also in acquisition talks with a company he declined to identify that has annual revenue of about $35 million to $45 million. </TEXT></DOC>
