 The efforts spent on bringingcomputer-integrated manufacturing (CIM) to plant floors have been motivatedby the overall thrust to increase the speed of new products to market.andP;  Oneof the links in CIM is plant floor scheduling, which is concerned withefficiently orchestrating the plant floor to meet the customer demand andresponding quickly to changes on the plant floor and changes in customerdemand.andP;  The Expert System Scheduler (ESS) has been developed to address thislink in CIM.andP;  The scheduler utilizes real-time plant information to generateplant floor schedules which honor the factory resource constraints whiletaking advantage of the flexibility of its components.andM;The scheduler uses heuristics developed by an experienced human factoryscheduler for most of the decisions involved in scheduling.andP;  The expertise ofthe human scheduler has been built into the computerized version using theexpert system approach of the discipline of artificial intelligence (AI).andO;Deterministic simulation concepts have been used to develop the schedule anddetermine the decision points.andP;  As such, simulation modeling and AItechniques share many concepts, and the two disciplines can be usedsynergistically.andP;  Examples of some common concepts are the ability ofentities to carry attributes and change dynamically(simulation--entities/attributes or transaction/parameters versusAI--frames/slots); the ability to control the flow of entities through amodel of the system (simulation--conditional probabilities versusAI--production rules); and the ability to change the model based upon statevariables (simulation--language constructs based on variables versusAI--pattern-invoked programs).andP;  Shannon [6] highlights similarities anddifferences between conventional simulation and an AI approach.andP;  Kusiak andChen [3] report increasing use of simulation in development of expertsystems.andM;ESS uses the synergy between AI techniques and simulation modeling togenerate schedules for plant floors.andP;  Advanced concepts from each of the twoareas are used in this endeavor.andP;  The expert system has been developed usingframes and object-oriented coding which provides knowledge representationflexibility.andP;  The concept of &quot;backward&quot; simulation, similar to the AI conceptof backward chaining, is used to construct the events in the schedule.andP;  Someportions of the schedule are constructed using forward or conventionalsimulation.andM;The implementation of expert systems and simulation concepts is intertwinedin ESS.andP;  However, the application of the concepts from these two areas willbe treated separately for ease of presentation.andP;  We will first discuss theexpert system approach and provide a flavor of the heuristics.andP;  The conceptof backward simulation and the motive behind it will then be explored alongwith some details of the implementation and the plant floor where thescheduler is currently being used.andP;  We will then highlight some advantagesand disadvantages of using the expert simulation approach for scheduling,and, finally, the synergetic relationship between expert systems andsimulation.andM;Expert SystemsandM;ApproachandM;Traditionally, plant floor scheduling has been a difficult problem to solve.andO;Even after decades of research, management scientists have failed to findsolution approaches which can be applied in practice for job-shop scheduling[4].andP;  Most commercially available packages have not found genericapplication.andP;  The limitations on their applicability occur for severalreasons: lack of a good user interface, preventing an average user from usingthe packages effectively; and inability to customize the packages torequirements of a particular plant.andP;  Also, some of the math-based schedulingpackages require large computation times in their search for a near optimumsolution.andP;  The problem lends itself well to application of an expert systemsapproach.andP;  In recent years, there have been several efforts to utilize thisapproach for solving scheduling problems [3].andP;  The expertise of a humanscheduler can be utilized to establish heuristic procedures which lead toschedules meeting the objectives of particular plants.andP;  The expertise is alsoutilized to customize the heuristics for meeting different objectives, or forproviding a different set of heuristics for widely varying objectives.andM;The expert for this system was a plant floor scheduler with 20 years ofexperience in the field.andP;  He was very articulate in formulating thescheduling heuristics which took important plant floor issues into account.andO;He was an excellent abstract thinker and capable of generalizing fromspecific situations to abstract application.andP;  His experience also guided thedevelopment to concentrate on situations prevalent on plant floors, ratherthan dealing with all possible situations.andP;  His expertise was also used inevaluating the schedules generated using the heuristics.andP;  He guided thedevelopers through iterations of evaluation and modification of heuristicsuntil they met the requirements.andP;  The knowledge of the expert was put in theform of heuristics by knowledge engineers with AI and expert systemsdevelopment background.andP;  Developers for this system had a strong backgroundin manufacturing scheduling and simulation software development and weretrained in use of AI tools and languages.andM;The heuristics are used for the following decisions:andM;* Part dispatching--determining which part order will be scheduled next fromthe candidate part orders.andP;  A part order is defined as an order for a certainquantity of a particular part type.andP;  The quantity may be determined based oncustomer orders and batch-sizing considerations.andM;* Machine selection--determining which machine among the candidate machineswill be used to process the selected part order.andM;* Interval selection--determining which time interval in the window of timebeing considered on the selected machine is most suitable to process theselected part order.andP;  One of the trade-offs in this particular situation issetup versus Just-In-Time.andM;* Secondary resource constraints--determining when to consider theconstraints of labor, tooling, purchased parts, gages etc.andM;* Supporting events consideration--determining when to schedule preventivemaintenance, service parts and safety stock replenishment production.andM;The types of specific information which can be incorporated usingknowledge-based technology are illustrated in the process of choosing themachine for the next operation on a batch of parts.andP;  When multiple machinesare available the following selection criteria are used:andM;1.andP;  The scheduler determines the ideal completion time for the batch ofparts.andM;2.andP;  A window of time in which the operation on that batch can be scheduled isdetermined for each eligible machine.andP;  All machines which can perform theoperation to be scheduled are eligible for consideration.andP;  The window isdependent on the process time for the operation and various user-controlledparameters.andM;3.andP;  Each machine is checked for a block of idle time within the window whichis large enough to schedule at least x percent of the operation and anyassociated setups.andP;  &quot;x&quot; is machine and operation-dependent.andM;Expert system technology facilitates the handling of complex reasoning.andP;  Thisis illustrated with the following heuristic which is used in conjunction withbackward simulation [1]:andM;1.andP;  If there are intervals which will completely contain the runtime (thetime required to perform the operation and the setups), the interval whichwould yield the most synchronous schedule over all primary machines ischosen.andP;  Some consideration is also given to the secondary goal of setupminimization.andM;2.andP;  If there is no complete fit of the total runtime (process + setup), but apartial fit of some minimum percentage exists, all preceding operations onthe chosen machine are shifted earlier in time to make room for the one whichneeds to be scheduled.andP;  This results in having to shift all the affectedoperations across all the machines which precede those shifted on the machinebeing scheduled.andP;  The recursion techniques in Lisp handle this quite well.andM;3.andP;  If no fit is found on the primary machines, backup machines for theoperation are examined.andP;  Backup machines are capable of running an operationbut are not the machines of choice of plant floor personnel for the purpose.andO;An operation is scheduled on a backup only when it cannot be scheduled onprimary machines in a desired time window and when allowed by the user.andP;  Botha complete fit and a partial fit are successively examined on backupmachines, similar to the approach taken for scheduling on primary machines.andM;4.andP;  If no fit of any kind is found, the window is shifted earlier in time andanother iteration is done.andM;5.andP;  In following the precepts of Just-In-Time, arrival of components isscheduled at the assembly cell on an as-needed basis.andP;  For example, if anassembly requires three batches of a given component, the first arrives whenassembly begins, the second arrives 1/3 of the way through assembly, and thethird arrives 2/3 of the way through the process.andM;The primary objective of the heuristics is to meet customer demand.andO;Secondary objectives may be setup minimization and work-in-processminimization.andP;  Setups are scheduled where possible during the transfer ofparts from one machine to another to anticipate the arrival of correspondingparts from the previous operation.andP;  When more than one eligible machine isequally well suited to meet customer due date, or is within a minimalpercentage of another, the machine which minimizes setups is selected.andO;Tuning parameters are available to the user to generate schedules closer toobjectives in his/her environment.andP;  For example, through these parameters theuser can indicate a preference toward low work-in-process inventory at thecost of higher number of setups or toward a lower number of setups at thecost of higher work-in-process inventory.andM;The data and plant-specific knowledge is organized into several knowledgebases (KBs) which are accessed by scheduling heuristics.andP;  The KBs and thecorresponding information stored in them is represented in Figure 1.andP;  Theknowledge used for factory control consists of knowledge regarding machinedowntimes and the schedules under which the floor is currently operating.andO;These are stored in Calendar and Gantt KB respectively.andP;  Similarly, theknowledge about machines and routings is stored in Factory KB whileinformation about part containers is stored in Container KB.andP;  The dataregarding customer orders is stored in Orders KB.andP;  These knowledge basestogether create a model of the factory.andP;  The model is used by expertheuristics and deterministic simulation concepts to generate the schedules.andM;Simulation ConceptsandM;Simulation concepts have been implemented using object-oriented programming.andO;A model of the plant floor is developed using frames to represent parts,machines and operations (processes) [1]:andM;* Associated with each part is a process plan which identifies the sequenceof operations or processes to be performed on that part.andP;  The part class isfurther subdivided into assemblies and component parts.andP;  The assemblysubclass can be used to define final assemblies as well as subassemblies.andO;Assemblies identify how many of what components are required for assemblyoperation.andM;* Machines eligible to perform operations are identified by each operation.andM;* Associated with the operations are the setup and process times required foreach part on which the operation can be performed.andM;The concept of backward simulation is used to construct the schedules.andP;  Theconcept has existed in a simple form in scheduling literature under the name&quot;backward scheduling.&quot;andP;  In the library of AI techniques, a somewhat similarconcept of backward chaining is used.andP;  Backward chaining works by startingfrom a goal state and working backwards to the initial state using productionrules whose outcomes are goal state or subgoal states.andP;  In AI literature,backward chaining usually does not include modeling passage of time.andP;  Inbackward simulation, the idea is to start with the goal state, and thensimulate passage of time backward to the initial state.andP;  In a plant floorscheduling context, the goal state is the end of the horizon with allcustomer demands satisfied with production as close to due dates as possible.andO;The events are simulated backward, starting from the last operation of a partto its first operation.andM;The major motivation of using backward simulation comes from the thrust toimplement the Just-In-Time philosophy.andP;  It is difficult to determine therelease time for an order on the plant floor using forward scheduling orconventional forward simulation for complex scenarios.andP;  Several iterationswill be required to determine correct release times for the hundreds oforders processed by a practical-sized department on the plant floor.andP;  Queuingtheory relations provide approximations to determine service times in simplemultiserver networks, but few approximations are available for practicalsituations with multiple resource constraints and multiple routings.andP;  Also,the queuing theory approximations provide means values which will not predictthe release times of the orders as accurately as backward simulation.andM;The backward simulation considers known or deterministic machineunavailabilities similar to forward simulation.andP;  These known unavailabilitiesmay be due to shift timings, current breakdowns or tool tryouts.andP;  Randommachine breakdowns are not considered explicitly during scheduling, thoughsome slack may be included to account for their occurrence.andP;  The ability toquickly generate schedules, combined with the ability to access real-timeinformation allows generating new schedules in response to such machinebreakdowns.andM;The use of backward simulation does require care in implementation oftraditional dispatching rules.andP;  For example, while simulating backward intime the job with the latest due date will be selected first to get theeffect of the traditional dispatching rule &quot;earliest due date first.&quot;andO;Similarly, the job with the longest process time will be selected first toget the effect of the traditional dispatching rule &quot;earliest due date first.&quot;andO;Similarly, the job with the longest process time will be selected first toget the effect of the shortest process time rule.andP;  As such, the traditionaldispatching rules are not being used directly in ESS, though some of theheuristics are based upon due dates.andM;At times, a plant may receive orders which it cannot satisfy by the due datesdesired by the customer due to capacity constraints.andP;  In conventional orforward simulation, this situation will be reflected by orders beingcompleted later than their due dates.andP;  Backward simulation leads to orderrelease times which are earlier than the beginning of the scheduling horizonin such a situation.andP;  The system will indicate that to meet the customerorders by the desired due dates the orders should have been released sometimein the past.andP;  In such a case, if the requirements or capacity are notadjusted, some of the orders will be made late.andP;  The new release times insuch cases are calculated by intelligently shifting the schedule forward intime, using idle time intervals on machines until it becomes feasible.andP;  Theplant can advise its customers of the expected delay in completion of theorders.andP;  The system also allows easy interfaces to revise order due dates andquantities and to update machine availability for adding overtime.andP;  Either ofthese mechanisms can be used to explore available options.andM;Once customer orders have been scheduled, any remaining capacity is utilizedby scheduling safety stock replenishments and low priority orders.andP;  Both thesafety stock replenishments and low priority production orders are scheduledusing forward simulation.andP;  These are placed within the idle time intervalsleft on the machines due to excess capacity.andP;  The schedule is also adjustedfor scheduling preventive maintenance events and for honoring constraints ofexpected material receipts, labor, tooling etc.andM;The graphical representation of the schedules in ESS provides an easy way tovalidate the schedules.andP;  In addition to visual review, the schedulesgenerated by ESS were validated and evaluated through a simulation model ofthe first application site.andP;  A very detailed simulation model developed usingAutoMod and GPSS/H were used for this purpose.andP;  Schedules generated byseveral other commercial-scheduling packages were also evaluated using thesame simulation model.andM;The simulation model served to analyze the feasibility of ESS-generatedschedules.andP;  The impact of the schedule on plant resources which were notconsidered by the scheduler itself was evaluated.andP;  For example, the schedulerassumes that both the material-handling system and the in-process storagecapacities are unconstrained.andP;  The first application site was designed withadequate capacities in each of these areas.andP;  The simulation indicated thatthe schedules were feasible when these resources were constrained to actualcapacities.andM;The quality of schedules was evaluated based on due date performance, machineutilization, and the synchronization of material flow.andP;  The results providedan evaluation of relative performance of the considered scheduling packages.andO;It was demonstrated that ESS-generated schedules met customer demand on timewith a highly synchronous material flow.andP;  In fact, ESS was selected as thescheduling tool for this automated facility based on these evaluations.andM;ApplicationandM;ESS has been developed using the package KEE, which is a product ofIntelliCorp.andP;  The simulation concepts and heuristics have been coded usingLisp.andP;  The scheduler is currently resident on Texas Instruments (TI) ExplorerII hardware.andM;The system is being used at a highly automated facility involved inautomotive component production.andP;  The factory consists of machining and heattreatment cells linked by an Automated Guided Vehicle System (AGVS).andP;  It alsoincludes an Automatic Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS) for supplied partsand subassemblies, inprocess work and manufacturing tools.andP;  More than 50robots are used to load and unload parts in different processing cells.andP;  Toolbanks are automatically transported to the cell by the AGVS where they aremanually interchanged.andP;  All machine tools are numerically controlled.andP;  Eachmachining cell is fitted with in-process gauging equipment and incorporatesstatistical processing control to ensure that all parts conform tospecifications.andP;  Each cell is linked to the factory-level computer via abroadband MAP network.andM;The plant floor is controlled through a Factory Control System (FCS) whichresides on a Stratus 2000 computer.andP;  The factory floor status information ismaintained by the FCS.andP;  In addition, the FCS contains current data oncustomer orders and on the expected material receipts.andP;  All this informationis sent through a computer network to the TI Explorer II whenever thesituation warrants a new schedule.andP;  ESS is used to generate a new schedulewithin a short time, and the schedule is sent back to the FCS for execution.andO;The FCS sends appropriate commnds to the plant floor cell controllers forimplementing the schedule.andP;  The information flows to and from ESS are shownin Figure 2.andM;A friendly user interface is very important for acceptance of an expertsystem by the users [5].andP;  ESS uses a very user-friendly mouse-driveninterface.andP;  The schedule is presented to the user in the form of a Ganttchart as shown in Figure 3.andP;  The figure shows the schedule for an 8-hourperiod for a small department on a plant floor.andP;  The user has an option tomouse-click on an operation and get more details as shown in the figure.andP;  Theuser can scroll the Gantt chart up and down if there are more than 24machines, and right and left to look across the scheduling horizon.andO;Successive operation of one particular batch of parts can be highlighted tofollow its flow through the machines.andP;  In the figure the flow of a batch ofparts of type &quot;46gb&quot; is highlighted.andM;The user can have the system generate the schedule step-by-step and followits construction, or run all the steps together.andP;  Users of the Gantt chartinterface have found it very useful as it gives them an understanding of howthe schedule is built and its overall performance.andP;  It also gives the user aquick means of evaluating the quality of schedule.andM;Aside from the highly automated facility, where the scheduler has beencontrolling the production for several months, the scheduler has beenevaluated by modeling and generating schedules for several factories whichare not so highly automated.andP;  The system has also been transported to SUNworkstations to allow more hardware configuration options at future sites.andO;The evaluations and added portability have helped develop the heuristics forgeneric application.andM;Advantages/DisadvantagesandM;There are some disadvantages associated with these systems.andP;  There are fewpeople with expertise in expert system building tools and techniques,proficiency in Lisp, experience in scheduling and simulation, and extensivemanufacturing backgrounds.andP;  Knowledge acquisition for expert systems requiresspecial skills.andP;  Developers of these early systems need to be selectedcarefully, and given extensive training.andP;  Although prices are coming down,hardware (Lisp machines) and software are still expensive.andP;  Consulting by AIcompanies is very expensive.andP;  A technical challenge is to design and developthese systems in a way that will eliminate the need for an AI expert to makemost of the changes and enhancements.andP;  Additional issues are expected tosurface as the system is implemented in multiple sites.andM;Interfacing AI hardware to general-purpose hardware requires quite a bit ofeffort.andP;  Some of the speed advantage of AI hardware is lost due to timerequirements for transferring data back and forth.andP;  At the first ESSapplication site, ongoing efforts have reduced the data transfer timessubstantially from their initial values.andP;  However, the total time for datatransfer is still longer than typical schedule generation and review time.andM;The backward simulation approach can be effectively used for generatingschedules.andP;  However, it cannot be used to examine the effect of randomevents.andP;  If robustness of a schedule is to be evaluated, it will have to besimulated in a traditional manner incorporating random events.andP;  To a largeextent the fast response of the scheduler reduces the concern about therobustness of the schedule.andM;Advantages of an expert system-based scheduler include the incorporation ofheuristics to tailor a scheduler to a particular business site.andP;  Thescheduler can be easily customized to allow for operation peculiarities,business plans, operation goals, specific customers and order mix.andO;Model-based reasoning allows utilization of heuristics aimed at achieving thegoals of synchronous scheduling, setup minimization, and machine dedicationunder changing factory conditions.andM;The ability to prototype rapidly is a benefit resulting from the use of anexpert system shell.andP;  Some of thespecific features which support rapidconstruction of systems are the developer interface tools, the inheritancefeatures, the provisions for structuring knowledge, the modularity, and theease of incremental development.andP;  Specifically, incremental developmentfacilitates the understanding of a complex and ill-structured problem likefactory scheduling.andP;  A limited module can be quickly developed for simulationtesting to determine which additional factors need to be incorporated intothe model.andM;Another advantage this technology offers is that the knowledge representationscheme is relatively generic.andP;  The frame-based knowledge representationstructure provided by the expert system tool eases the integration of thevarious knowledge bases developed for this phase of the project.andM;The interactive Gantt chart is a very valuable tool for both understandingnew scheduling techniques and debugging the generated schedules.andO;Understanding of the scheduling algorithms and the performance of theschedule is gained through graphical representation of relationships betweenbatches on one machine and across machines.andP;  The graphical display makes iteasier to spot inconsistencies or irregularities in a schedule.andP;  However, thegraphics may be found more useful by people dealing with smaller plants.andM;This technology offers unusual flexibility for change.andP;  An expertsystem-based scheduler can be easily customized to a particular application.andO;Heuristics, or rules, can be incorporated to cover conditions at specificsites.andM;Perhaps one of the biggest advantages is the user acceptance of the schedule.andO;The user can understand and believe in the system.andP;  The data on which theschedule is based is easily accessible and in an understandable form.andM;ConclusionandM;The application described in this article utilizes advanced concepts in AIand simulation modeling, together with the latest in computer hardware andgraphics for effective real-time control of the plant floor.andP;  Though thisapplication has been developed independently, development of such a systemwas hypothesized by Shannon in 1984 [1].andP;  This application proves that thedisciplines of AI and simulation modelling can be used synergistically for apractical purpose.andM;It is important to integrate the AI, Operations Research (OR) and computersystems software and hardware technologies to address the competitivechallenges of today's market.andP;  Most of the problems cannot be clearlyclassified as being from one discipline only.andP;  AI has the strength to useexperts' knowledge in problems where experience can be effectively used toreduce solution time and efforts.andP;  OR has the strength to providemathematical insights into a problem and uses mathematical models todetermine ways to arrive at optimal or close to optimal solutions.andP;  Advancesin computer systems software and hardware technologies provide means to makeboth AI and OR methodologies faster and easier to use.andP;  Synergisticapplication of all these technologies to a given problem may lead to a muchbetter solution with a much higher chance of use than would the applicationof any one of these technologies by itself.andM;ReferencesandM;[1]  Barber, K., Burridge, K., and Osterfeld, D.andP;
