HughesStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/01/86</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GCN LTD CHHRETAILING (RET)TENDER OFFERS, MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS (TNM) </IN><TEXT>   Limited Inc. and Edward J. DeBartolo Corp. said they would proceed as planned with their $55-a-share tender offer for Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc. scheduled to start today. The move comes despite a pivotal shareholder's indication that it wouldn't support the bid.    Carter Hawley hasn't yet responded to the $1.77 billion bid, which was announced last week, except to say that it would consider it.    Carter Hawley's president and chief executive officer, Philip M. Hawley, had scheduled a series of news interviews for last Friday, but canceled them at the last moment; a spokesman said that Mr. Hawley was too busy with other meetings. Mr. Hawley had scheduled the interviews with the condition that he wouldn't discuss the proposed takeover.    A spokesman for Retail Partners, the company formed by Limited and DeBartolo to carry out the takeover, wouldn't comment on indications from General Cinema Corp., which holds a large stake in Carter Hawley, that it wouldn't support the bid.    The spokesman also wouldn't comment on speculation by industry analysts that General Cinema is waiting for Retail Partners to increase its offer. Several analysts last week estimated the breakup value for the Los Angeles-based retailer at $65 a share.    General Cinema, which holds a stake of one million shares of preferred stock, convertible to 12.2 million common shares, or 38.6% of Carter Hawley on a fully diluted basis, hasn't commented since stating last Wednesday that it wouldn't accept the proposed offer.    General Cinema, a Newton, Mass.-based bottler and movie house operator, bought its Carter Hawley stake in 1984, when it played a major role in preventing a takeover by Limited. Because Retail Partners conditioned its offer on its acquiring at least two-thirds of Carter Hawley's stock outstanding by Dec. 31, the purchase of the General Cinema stake is crucial to the offer's success.    In composite trading Friday, Carter Hawley closed on the New York Stock Exchange at $52.875, up $1.375, after gaining $8.25 since the proposed offer was announced. General Cinema, which stands to make a pre-tax profit of $371 million on the $55-a-share offer, closed in Big Board composite trading at $48.50, up 87.5 cents. Limited closed on the Big Board composite tape at $32.625, down 50 cents.    Limited is a Columbus, Ohio-based specialty retailer. It hopes to gain control of Carter Hawley operations such as Neiman-Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman. DeBartolo is a closely held Youngstown, Ohio-based real estate developer and the biggest operator of shopping malls in the U.S. </TEXT></DOC>
