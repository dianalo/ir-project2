The office is a sign of the times in China, as the governmenttries to control corruption all over the country.   ``The response of the people has been excellent,'' said afrazzled Wu Yuhua, the 35-year-old station head, a week after thecenter opened July 29. ``They are very curious and have manycomplaints.''   Housed in a cramped 19th century mud-and-mortar dwelling, cappedwith the traditional sweeping eaves of a Chinese home, the centeris in a Beijing alley, next to a butcher shop.   ``We wanted the people to be at home,'' Wu said. ``If we stuckit on the fifth floor of a government building, no one would comesee us.''   The station is manned six days a week for eight hours a day andis equipped with a telephone answering service for after-hourscalls.   In all, the station is responsible for about 6,000 governmentemployees serving 1.5 million people.   All reports are taken in secret to protect the callers and allinvestigations are handled by the reporting station.   ``Too much corruption is investigated in China by the corruptbureau itself,'' said Wan Songching, the 50-year-old director ofthe east district's investigative wing. ``But this reportingstation will do its own work. We are eager to see results.''   Similar corruption reporting centers are opening all over thecountry and the government says that by September every provincewill one. In addition, a telephone corruption hotline opened inBeijing in early August, ready to take calls from across the nation.   Wu said such devices are necessary if China is going to reformits government.   ``In the past the government always policed itself,'' heexplained. ``Now we've got to have the support of the masses. Wecan't clean up the government alone.''   China has always tolerated a certain level of officialdishonesty. ``Guanxi,'' or connections, are the grease upon whichthe wheels of society run. But lately corruption has been gettingout of hand.   ``I am shocked at the change in my country,'' said Wang Poming,who returned in July after eight years in the United States.``Corruption is everywhere. School teachers force their students tobuy breakfast from them to make more money. Students steal testsand sell them for a profit.''   ``Corruption and inflation, that's all we Chinese are talkingabout,'' said Liu Yuanshang, a bookstore owner in Beijing. ``We areworried that all the dirt will stop the reforms.''   The reforms, pushed for the last decade by national leader DengXiaoping, have helped to double China's gross national product infive years to $295 billion in 1987.   But, by creating a two-track pricing system of low state-setprices and higher free market prices, the reforms have created vastopportunities for illegal deals.   In late July, 75 state-run businesses in the industrial city ofWuhan were exposed for making illegal profits off peasants. Thefirms bought state goods at fixed low prices and sold them tofarmers at large profits.   The reselling scheme has become so bad in the cigarette andliquor market that on July 28 the government raised the price ofChina's best brands by as much as 790 percent.   The official press said the move was made to crush a blackmarket that has gained a monopoly on high-quality cigarettes andspirit sales.   In battling corruption, the government's policies have beenunclear _ lax in one city, harsh in the next and creative somewhereelse.   In Shenyang, a northern city, the city government recentlyimposed a tax on banquets, cars and firecrackers, three items thatofficials often use public funds to buy.   In Beijing, Qiao Yonghang, 35, who had been working for severalyears at the state-owned Beijing Communications and Electrical Co.,was executed July 25 for taking bribes in exchange for colortelevision sets, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.   In all, he received bribes worth 120,000 yuan ($32,400), whichamounts to 125 years of the average urban salary.   Still, because of ``guanxi,'' a great percentage of officialcorruption continues.   China's leading paper, the People's Daily (Renmin Ribao),recently told of Gu Chengju, a forestry official in Hunan provincewho stole 300,000 yuan ($81,000) in state funds to build an officebuilding and a high-class guest house.   Almost two years after his case was exposed, Gu has yet to bebrought to justice.   The reason is that Gu has been greasing the hands of localofficials who were supposed to investigate him, the paper said.   ``This feudalistic practice of officials shielding one anothermust end,'' it said in a strong editorial.   Some Western analysts, notably Tony Kane, a China expert withthe Asia Society in New York, view the growing corruption as a signthat China is becoming more democratic.   ``During the Cultural Revolution the dirt and sleaze was just aswidespread but it was being perpetrated by only a fewindividuals,'' Kane said. ``Now, at least, you have a situationwhere more people are being allowed to participate. That is notnecessarily bad.''   Wu Yuhuan and his colleagues at the Embezzlement and BriberyReporting Station in east Beijing do not agree.   ``When a rat crosses the street the people run to beat it,'' Wusaid, citing a popular proverb. ``To me, corruption is the rat andI must kill it.''</TEXT></DOC>
