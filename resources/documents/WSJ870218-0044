Most shoppers have dark hair, but department store mannequins are all apt to be blond. On subway platforms, the passengers may have black hair, but the models in the advertising posters are blond. Every night, blondes parade across the television screen: A pool-playing platinum blonde promotes skin cream. A blonde housewife praises her blender while her blond children drink milkshakes. Blond shoppers squeeze the toilet paper and make the dark-haired shopkeeper collapse.    Most eye-opening of all is a bathing beauty known as the Superior Blonde, who entices television and billboard viewers to drink Superior beer. Mexicans who notice such things say she is the worst blond offender of all: If she is the Superior Blonde, they ask, does that mean that dark-haired Mexicans are inferior?    To a newcomer to Mexico, the barrage of blonds can be baffling. Mexican political rhetoric reveres the nation's Indian heritage. Political odds-makers say light-skinned candidates are often dark horses. Intellectuals scorn Barbie dolls and imported television sitcoms as cultural imperialism. Ad regulations supposedly outlaw &quot;foreign elements.&quot;    Why, then, is the commercial culture so blond?    &quot;It can be explained in one word: aspiration,&quot; says Manuel Munoz, vice president of J. Walter Thompson de Mexico, a unit of the New York-based advertising and public-relations firm JWT Group Inc. &quot;We're very proud of being Mexican. But way deep down, we'd all like to be living in San Diego and making dollars. It's a fact of life.&quot;    Exploiting Mexico's fascination with things gringo means associating consumer goods with blonds -- at least as Mexico defines the word blond. In the U.S., blond means flaxen-haired. Here, if you are blue-eyed, fair-skinned or just plain European-looking, you are a &quot;guero&quot;, or a blond. The most dishwater-dingy American can come to Mexico, be considered blond, and cash in on the cachet this culture awards people who look European.    Social critics often blame Televisa, Mexico's huge broadcast conglomerate, for importing blonde-laden TV shows like Dynasty and perpetuating the blond obsession. The complaint drives Televisa president Miguel Aleman Velasco crazy.    &quot;A lot of intellectuals say we make people feel hurt and frustrated,&quot; he says. &quot;But it doesn't hurt anybody. It's like telling a Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale.&quot;    As for the TV ads, Mr. Aleman says he can't censor the people who buy air time. The advertisers, for their part, say they can't help using blonds either. They take sample spots out to shopping malls and run them past housewives, they say, and the housewives invariably favor the ones with blond models.    Admen remember the time Fab detergent tried to advertise in Mexico using a popular movie actress called La India Maria. She spoke with a country accent, braided her hair peasant-style and wore the traditional dresses favored by the poorest &quot;campesinas&quot; in Mexico. La India Maria may have been a smash at the box office, but she bombed in the TV laundry room. Viewers apparently were offended at the sight of an underclass Indian telling them what to buy. La India Maria was replaced by a couple of city housewives trilling about Fab.    &quot;You've heard of 'esnobismo,'&quot; or snobbism, says Enrique Gibert, executive vice president of the Mexican subsidiary of the advertising agency Foote, Cone andamp; Belding. He once held a professional conference on the clash between national culture and advertising. &quot;The conclusion was, we could make ads much more Mexican,&quot; he says.    But he and other admen say the reputation of modeling in Mexico also works against them.    &quot;High-class Mexican families tend to think that being a model is somewhat in the fast lane,&quot; says J. Walter Thompson's Mr. Munoz. &quot;The feeling is very prevalent that a model is a loose woman who will bed down with anybody. So, few good-looking Mexican women become models.&quot;    That explanation is scant comfort to would-be model Maria Eugenia Montero. The hollow-cheeked 24-year-old once spent two years trying to break into television advertising. Walking on the street in a pair of blue jeans, she can snarl traffic, but on TV she was doomed by her dark skin and flat &quot;mestizo&quot; nose.    &quot;I went to the castings in every possible get-up,&quot; she says. &quot;I went sexy and they didn't want me. I went as a good little girl and they didn't want me.&quot; Slowly, she came to a disheartening conclusion: &quot;There's a lot of discrimination by Mexicans against Mexicans.&quot;    Finally she got her big break: a government spot for birth control. The slender Miss Montero looks like she lives on grapefruit, not tortillas, but the admen cast her as a pregnant peasant woman shuffling around the kitchen of a cinderblock house, cooking breakfast for her husband.    Consumer-goods commercials are apparently beyond Miss Montero's physical repertoire. Only once, she says, did a dark-skinned friend of hers make it into such a TV commercial. It was an ad for wine. The friend played a maid, serving wine to blonds.    Miss Montera finally gave up on TV modeling. Now she makes a living as a dancer. But the memory still stings.    &quot;It's unjust,&quot; she says. &quot;I'm in my own country, and I can't work. They think only white people are pretty. Where am I supposed to go?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
