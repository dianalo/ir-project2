The Mill Valley, Calif., brewing concern said it hired the investment banker in response to an announcement last month by the Paul Kalmanovitz Testamentary Trust that it was considering acquiring, through a tender offer or merger, the 2.3 million Falstaff shares it doesn't own.    A spokesman for the trust, also of Mill Valley, said it hadn't yet decided on an offer or how much it might be willing to pay for Falstaff's remaining shares. In national over-the-counter trading yesterday, Falstaff shares were quoted at $9.125 bid, giving the shares not owned by the trust an indicated value of about $21 million.    Mr. Kalmanovitz, who died in 1987, was a former president and chief executive officer of Falstaff. The trust, through its Sandamp;P Co. unit, owns three other brewing companies. </TEXT></DOC>
