The studies revealthat the interaction mechanisms responsible for spin freezing includeboth mean-free-path and anisotropy effects. A quantitative analysis ofthe contribution from these two effects has been made for samples with1 and 8 at. % Mn. For samples with fixed Au and varying Mn concentration,it has been shown that mean-free-path effects account for the changein the freezing temperature. A comparison of our results with pressurestudies of the freezing temperature of CuMn has been made.</TEXT></DOC>
