Think again] You are really self-employed(with a deferred income). Your new job is as a senior salesrepresentative and chief marketing officer. You are sellingpersonal services -- yours] And it is one of the mostdifficult jobs you will ever have.   For the first time in many years, white-collar workers andmanagers are being let go in large numbers to reduce costs.Last week General Motors announced that by 1995 it willemploy about half the number of white-collar workers itemployed in 1985. This oversupply dramatically changes thetask of finding a new job. Getting the resume up-to-date,answering a few ads and making some phone calls to friends inthe business just won't work.</LP><TEXT>   Instead, begin with the idea that you are in sales. Acceptthe fact that professional sales representatives often spend80% of their time prospecting and qualifying. They disciplinethemselves not to sell until they find out who is buyingwhat. The biggest rookie sales mistake is trying to selleverything to everybody. That explains the futility ofsending out all those resumes. You may think that you arebeing rejected. In actual fact, you are not even beingconsidered because you weren't professional enough to findout what was required in detail.   Selling is easy if you can find someone who is buying.Finding the right person at the right time is what makesselling so difficult and demanding. For a job search, theinitial challenge is not to find a job; the challenge is toget meetings with professionals. You want them to share withyou vital information and leads. You want to know what ishappening with their organization, industry, supplier base,key customers, geographic area and anything else that may putyou on the track of the right person and the right situation.   Even in these times, there is movement. People getpromotions and transfers. People get in fights with theirboss and get fired. People have to move to follow a spouse toa new location. All this and much more is what you mustlearn.   Gathering this type of information is the reason whyprofessional sales people make sales calls. They want to knowwho just got a new contract. They want to find out who thenew V.P. is. They want to learn about the plant that justwent to a third shift. Do they pick up a good deal ofnegative or useless information in the process? Sure they do,but they filter that out and keep on making calls. Thequality and quantity of information that you get withface-to-face meetings cannot be duplicated by any othermethod.   Contact your friends for starters as in the past, butdon't ask for a job or a lead; you are in the process ofdoing the up-front research that's required in order to makea professional career move. Good friends understand thismeeting process and will make time for you. Good managersalso understand that they gain from these types of meetingstoo.   Remember, the focus is always on the other person. Thebest sales professionals don't always make the bestpresentations, but they always ask the best questions. Keepyour own comments and answers short and to the point and makeyour questions sharp and focused on uncovering what's goingon, and on whom you should meet with next. If someone says hewill pass your resume along, thank him politely. Tell him youdon't have one with you. Ask him who he plans to give it toand would he have any objection to your contacting thatperson directly?   We have all been trained to scan resumes for red flags andknock-out factors. Resume screening is a process used toeliminate candidates. Resumes are not selling sheets. Theyare little live hand grenades (with the pins removed) thatcan blow you out of consideration for a position before youeven determine what it is that you are losing out on.   Experienced sales professionals don't go around passingout a lot of specification sheets for their products orservices. They know that if they gather enough informationabout their potential prospects that they might be able tomodify or customize a standard product to be able to do thejob. The same is true in selling your services. Don't getahead of yourself. An informational meeting comes first, afollow-up thank-you note second, and follow-through contactswith those people recommended at your first meeting is afterthat. If and when you do get to the point where you feel aresume is appropriate, then do up a custom one for just thatsituation. Sales professionals don't make boilerplateproposals.   A word here on classified ads. These are really requestsfor &quot;bids.&quot; Sales people know that sitting in their officeresponding to RFQ's (request for quotes) is not usuallyproductive. They know that someone else has preset therequirements and the chances of breaking through with a paperresponse is just about nil. Those job ads that are run tendto produce responses in the hundreds and result in &quot;cattlecalls&quot; when people follow-up in person. Getting lost in thatshuffle then becomes a high probability. The feelings offrustration and rejection generated are not worth the slimchance of a breakthrough.   One other sales technique to consider is to take aspecific order for what is wanted. A whole new area ofopportunity has opened up in temporary employment ofprofessionals. You won't get full price and you will not getbenefits, but often these assignments lead to internalcontacts and information that will give you the inside trackon a more substantial position.   Do sales representatives get down and discouraged? Everyone of them does. They beat it by going back and working atthe little daily things that they know must be done. Theygive themselves great credit for meetings and contacts. Theydon't let the big potential commission prevent them fromfocusing on the next interim step. Persistence always pays.   ---   Mr. Falvey, a sales trainer and public speaker, lives inLondonderry, N.H., where he has helped others sell themselvesinto new jobs.</TEXT></DOC>
