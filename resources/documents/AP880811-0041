(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL leader Jim Bakker says heplans to recapture his television ministry by outbidding a Canadiancompany for PTL's assets when the bankruptcy sale closes next month.   The Canadian company, Samoth Capital Corp., has offered $113million _ $46 million in cash immediately and the rest over fiveyears.   Bakker said the Canadian offer's real value is $77 million afterdiscounting such things as interest that could be earned if themoney were paid to PTL immediately. He said he plans to outbid thatamount.   PTL agreed last week to give Samoth Capital's president, PeterThomas of Vancouver, until Sept. 16 to decide whether he wants togo through with the deal. Until then, PTL is free to consider otheroffers.   Thomas was scheduled to begin inspecting the property today,said PTL trustee M.C. ``Red'' Benton.   Also today, U.S. Bankruptcy Court Judge Rufus Reynolds wasexpected to hear arguments in a dispute between The CharlotteObserver and Bakker's attorneys.   Bakker's attorneys are protesting the sale of Bakker'sdeposition transcripts to the newspaper by a court reporter, sayingtheir premature release is unfair to Bakker.   Bakker was preparing his defense in PTL's $52 million lawsuitthat charges him with grossly mismanaging the ministry and theHeritage USA theme park at Fort Mill, S.C., he founded but leftlast year after acknowledging a sexual encounter with Jessica Hahn.   Using the transcripts as its source, the Observer published anarticle last week that quoted Bakker as saying he believedthousands of internal PTL documents had been destroyed since heresigned as president in March 1987. Ministry officials denied that.   Reynolds appeared to agree to with Bakker and last week issuedan order protecting the release of further transcripts. TheObserver said it plans to protest the order.   PTL has been in bankruptcy proceedings since June 1987, threemonths after Bakker resigned. Bakker has said he wants to buy PTL'sassets, including the Heritage USA Christian retreat and the PTLsatellite TV network, and return as its leader.   Bakker's attorney, Jim Toms, wouldn't provide details aboutBakker's bid, but promised that ``what money is paid will be paidat closing, and it will be a number that will be in excess of whatwe believe the present value of the Canadian deal to be.''   They weren't specific about when the offer would be made, sayingthey are still making arrangements with unidentified overseaslenders.   Asked why anyone would lend Bakker so much money when a federalgrand jury is investigating him for possible criminal wrongdoing,Bakker replied: ``That's not really a problem with these people.I'm not expecting to be indicted, anyway.''   Benton said Wednesday that before PTL will deal with Bakker, hemust deposit a substantial amount of cash or securities toguarantee that he has the ability to buy the assets.   The Canadian group has deposited $50,000 and has pledged $4.95million more as soon as it decides whether to go through with thepurchase. Bakker's offer doesn't provide for any advance deposit.</TEXT></DOC>
