But police in the City, London's financial district, said investigations are at an early stage and charges haven't been brought yet.    The alleged fraud attempt involved the transfer of funds from the London branch of Union Bank, Switzerland's biggest bank, to a Nyon, Switzerland, branch of Credit Suisse. Authorities uncovered the alleged attempt late last week.    According to a Credit Suisse spokesman in Zurich, Swiss police arrested two individuals in Nyon Friday as they allegedly attempted to collect the money. City of London police yesterday said they are questioning two others about the case here, but didn't divulge further details. A UBS spokesman in London declined to comment because the case is under investigation.    London police Monday described the case as &quot;theft&quot; and said the money was transferred from London to Nyon using a computer-based switching system and fraudulent instructions. They said the alleged fraud attempt was foiled and the money frozen because of cooperation between London and Swiss police.    Yesterday, the Credit Suisse spokesman said close cooperation between the two big Swiss banks also helped prevent the fraud so that they lost nothing.    It still is unclear how the alleged fraud was discovered. Some British news reports suggested police were alerted after the transfer of money triggered a computerized alarm in Switzerland. Other media accounts said the attempt was discovered only because a Zurich computer failure prevented completion of the transfer. </TEXT></DOC>
