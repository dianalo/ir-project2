Mr. Bruchhausen, a 47-year-old West German citizen, faces as many as five years in prison and a fine of as much as $1,000 for each of the counts. He was convicted by federal Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler, and is scheduled for sentencing March 30.    The scheme involved selling about $6 million of military surveillance equipment and semiconductor-making systems between 1978 and 1980. The equipment reached the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and East Germany, according to William F. Fahey, an assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case.    To get around U.S. laws that bar sales of sensitive technology to certain foreign countries, Mr. Bruchhausen set up several California and West German companies, Mr. Fahey said. He placed fraudulent orders for equipment with U.S. manufacturers, claiming the final users were other U.S. companies. He then exported them through fraudulent declarations to the U.S. Customs Service and the Commerce Department, Mr. Fahey said.    Mr. Fahey described Mr. Bruchhausen as the &quot;mastermind&quot; of the scheme. &quot;He set up the companies, dealt with the Soviets and provided all the orders to his associates.&quot;    Mr. Bruchhausen was first indicted in 1981 under U.S. export-controls laws for the same scheme. He fled the country and, after a search involving several U.S. government and foreign agencies, was arrested in 1985 in England. His extradition to the U.S. was held up for a year because export-control violations aren't covered by U.S. extradition treaties with Britain. However, the extradition was accomplished last June after a federal grand jury indicted Mr. Bruchhausen for wire fraud, which is covered by the extradition treaty.    Three other persons were indicted with Mr. Bruchhausen in 1981. Two of them -- Anatoli Maluta, a Soviet-born U.S. citizen, and Sabina Dorn Tittel, a West German citizen -- have already served jail terms. U.S. authorities are looking for the third, Dietmar Ulrichshofer, an Austrian citizen, who they believe is living in Vienna, Austria, Mr. Fahey said. </TEXT></DOC>
