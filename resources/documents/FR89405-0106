Introduction and Background</ITAG>In 1986, there were approximately 716,608 admissions of juveniles to publicand private residential programs housing delinquent or status offenders.These residential programs provide for the care and custody of youths placedby courts with juvenile court jurisdiction for delinquent offenses, non-criminalmisbehavior, or neglect and abuse. They include detention centers, sheltercare facilities, training schools, camps and ranches, group homes and community-basedcorrectional centers. On any given day one may find many thousands of youthshoused within these residential settings. Indeed, a 1987 census of Childrenin Custody revealed that 91,646 juveniles were in custody on a single dayin the approximately 3,300 public and private juvenile residential facilitiesserving juvenile courts throughout the United States. (Office of JuvenileJustice and Delinquency Prevention, <T3>Children in Custody: 1987 Census of Public and Private Juvenile Facilities.</T3>Publication Forthcoming.)Inadequate conditions of confinement within juvenile detention and correctionalfacilities present major obstacles to the provision of individualized justiceand effective services to meet the needs of youth in custody. At best,inadequate conditions can be counter-productive to the growth and developmentof juveniles in custody. At worst, they can be destructive and dehumanizing.The JJDP Act provides for the development of comprehensive strategies todeal with the problems of juvenile delinquency and other issues pertainingto the administration of juvenile justice in the United States. A majorpurpose of the JJDP Act is ``to develop and encourage the implementationof national standards for the administration of juvenile justice, includingrecommendations for administrative, budgetary, and legislative action atthe Federal, State, and local level to facilitate the adoption of suchstandards.'' (Sec. 102(a)(5))The 1988 amendment to the JJDP Act directly addresses the issue of conditionsof confinement for juveniles by requiring that the Office of Juvenile Justiceand Delinquency Prevention conduct a study to review the conditions injuvenile detention and correctional facilities and assess the extent towhich those conditions meet recognized national professional standards.The review of conditions in juvenile detention and correctional facilitiesis to result in a series of reports on the conditions existing within juvenilecustodial facilities (see Stage III). This material will be used by OJJDPin preparing a report to the Congress of the United States summarizingthe results of the study, and in making recommendations for improving theconditions in those facilities.The study outlined herein is a response to this recent amendment to theJJDP Act as well as a continuation of previous efforts by the Office ofJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention to encourage the adoption andutilization of national juvenile justice standards. For this study, existingnationally recognized standards addressing the conditions of confinementfor juveniles in custody are to be used as a basis for the review of conditionswithin juvenile detention and correctional facilities. The ultimate goalis to improve the operation of those facilities and the delivery of appropriateservices to juveniles.In addressing the extent to which conditions in juvenile detention andcorrectional facilities meet recognized national standards, the full rangeof available standards should be assessed to select those that should beapplied to this study. The legal literature, as it relates to the rightsof institutionalized persons, should also be reviewed to determine theextent to which conditions of confinement have been addressed in the courts.Standards provide a focal point for the assessment and improvement of theprocess of justice for juveniles by guiding policy and informing administrativeactions. Standards related to the conditions of confinement in juveniledetention and correctional facilities can provide specific and measurableobjectives, help define tasks to assist the accomplishment of goals, andprovide guidance in developing policies and procedures to improve servicedelivery.Previous efforts to establish national standards for the administrationof juvenile justice have been carried out by various national professionalorganizations and prominent national advisory committees. Included amongthese efforts are the following:(1) The Institute of Judicial Administration/American Bar Association JointCommission on Juvenile Justice Standards (IJA/ABA).(2) The National Advisory Committee on Criminal Justice Standards and GoalsTask Force on Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (Task Force).(3) National Advisory Committee for Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention:Standards on the Administration of Juvenile Justice (NAC).(4) American Correctional Association/Commission on Accreditation (ACA/CAC).The standards prepared by the IJA/ABA, the Task Force, and the NAC arecomprehensive and cover a wide range of issues including intervention inthe lives of children, delinquency prevention, court roles and procedures,the police, planning and evaluation, as well as other areas. The standardspromulgated by the ACA focus upon corrections and include community residentialservices, probation and aftercare, detention facilities and services, andtraining schools.One of the major activities of this program is to select and operationallydefine the ``conditions'' that will be assessed. Applicants are to addressa wide range of conditions of confinement, including but not limited to:andbullet; Intake and release criteria;andbullet; Judicial case review;andbullet; Mail, telephone use, and visitation;andbullet; Access to religious services;andbullet; Access to legal assistance;andbullet; Dress and personal property;andbullet; Educational, training and treatment programs;andbullet; Exercise and recreation;andbullet; Medical services;andbullet; Mental health care;andbullet; Isolation;andbullet; Diet and Nutrition;andbullet; Staff qualifications and numbers;andbullet; Sanitation, safety, and hygiene;andbullet; Physical environment and living conditions;andbullet; Resident rights, sanctions, and grievance procedures;andbullet; Monitoring and reporting behaviour of residents. Standards promulgated by Federal agencies, professional organizations andnational advisory committees do not, necessarily, obligate states, localjurisdictions, or private agencies to comply with those standards. It isexpected, however, that the policies, procedures, and practices establishedat the state and local level for juvenile detention and correctional facilitieswill reflect, to varying degrees, recognized national standards. This study,therefore, will involve the identification of local detention and Statecorrectional policies, procedures, practices and programs and the determinationof the extent to which they are consistent with nationally recognized standards.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Program Goals and Objectives </ITAG>A. Goals 1. To review recognized national professional standards for juvenile detentionand correctional facilities. 2. To assess conditions in juvenile detention and correctional facilitiesand determine the extent to which those conditions meet recognized nationalstandards. 3. To make recommendations for improving the conditions of confinementin juvenile detention and correctional facilities through the identificationof model policies, procedures, practices and programs that are consistentwith recognized national standards. B. Objectives 1. Develop a research strategy to conduct an assessment of conditions ofconfinement in juvenile detention and correctional facilities. 2. Collect data on the conditions within juvenile detention and correctionalfacilities. 3. Analyze the data on the conditions of confinement within juvenile detentionand correctional facilities, report on the analysis and develop specificrecommendations for improving the conditions of confinement. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Program Strategy </ITAG>OJJDP's planning and program development activities are guided by a frameworkthat specifies four (4) sequential phases of program development: Research,development, demonstration, and dissemination. This framework guides thedecision-making process regarding the funding of future stages of the program.This program is a research initiative. The purpose of the research initiativeis to conduct and support research on issues that relate to the administrationof juvenile justice and to the prevention of delinquency in the UnitedStates. The program will be conducted in three discrete incremental stages:(I) The research design stage, which involves the development of a researchmethodology for the assessment of conditions of confinement in juveniledetention and correctional facilities; (II) The Data collection stage,in which data will be collected, processed and prepared for analysis usingthe methodology developed in the previous stage; and (III) The data analysisand reporting stage, which involves the analysis of the data and the preparationof reports that summarize the results of the study and provide recommendationsfor improving conditions of confinement in juvenile detention and correctionalfacilities. All technical and subject matter portions of the program will be guidedby recommendations of a project advisory committee established specificallyfor the program. The project advisory committee will provide comments andrecommendations regarding the strategies and activities for this program.It may be necessary to change or supplement project advisory committeemembers for different stages of the program. However, the objective willbe to select technical and subject matter experts capable of addressingissues related to each of the program stages. The project advisory committee members should have combined expertise injuvenile corrections, criminal/juvenile justice research and evaluation,and standards pertaining to the administration of juvenile justice, particularlyas they relate to juvenile corrections.Each state of the program development process detailed below is designedto result in a complete and publishable product (e.g.: A research designthat includes a review of existing recognized national standards, the researchstrategy, and reports to be prepared), and a dissemination strategy toinform the field of the development of the program and the results andproducts of each stage. A decision to continue or to terminate the programis made at the end of each state based on the availability of funds andthe quality and utility of program products.A. Stage I_Research DesignThe first stage of the program consists of developing the research design.The research should be designed to produce recommendations that can guidethe development of programs to improve the conditions within detentionand correctional facilities. This wil involve the identification and reviewof national standards for detention and correctional facilities and thedevelopment of clear, well justified definitions of ``conditions'' and``detention and correctional facilities.''
