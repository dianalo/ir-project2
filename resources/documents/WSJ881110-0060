Miller (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> ELE </IN><TEXT>   The U.S. semiconductor industry's leading indicator contracted for the second straight month, as chipmakers move deeper into an anticipated slowdown.    The Semiconductor Industry Association, a Cupertino, Calif., trade group, said the so-called book-to-bill ratio was 0.92 at the end of October, down from 0.97 in September. A ratio of 0.92 means that for every $100 of product shipped, or booked, chipmakers received $92 in new orders.    A ratio greater than 1-to-1 indicates industry expansion as new orders outpace shipments; a lower ratio generally indicates the industry is in contraction.    The ratio has shown growth for nearly two years, as the semiconductor industry emerged from a prolonged slump. But it began to fall from strong levels in May, and dipped below 1-to-1 in September.    The trade group said average monthly orders for the three months ended Oct. 31 totaled $1.06 billion, down 8.7% from the period ended in September but 5.8% above the year-earlier level. Average shipments totaled $1.16 billion for the three-month period ended in October.    The drop in orders &quot;isn't all that unexpected,&quot; said Jim Feldhan, of In-Stat, a Scottsdale, Ariz., concern that monitors the semiconductor and computer industries. Mr. Feldhan said he anticipates the industry's fourth quarter will show a 5% decline from third-quarter orders, followed by an additional 1% decline in the first quarter of 1989.    &quot;The personal-computer market and the computer market in general are experiencing some softness,&quot; he said. Another contributing factor, he said, is that the book-to-bill ratio, which is based on dollar orders and not units, was swollen almost all of this year by higher prices for memory chips. Those prices are declining, as additional chip-fabricating capacity comes on line and the shortage eases. &quot;The price increases we've experienced in 1988 {have} contributed something close to 15%&quot; of the industry's revenue growth, he said.    In-Stat predicts &quot;next year and 1990 will be relatively flat years,&quot; Mr. Feldhan said, with next year showing 1% growth. That assumes the computer market doesn't go into a real decline. Should that happen, &quot;we could see a {chip industry} downturn of as much as 12%,&quot; he said.    The trade group said the order decline is caused by inventory corrections at some major customers, and &quot;slowing growth of major end markets.&quot; In late September, it predicted U.S. semiconductor sales would grow only 10% in 1989 after a 38% spurt this year, and projected a 6.6% drop in domestic sales in 1990.    Most experts say they think the decline in orders is part of a &quot;saner&quot; industry cycle. They don't expect chipmakers will hit the kind of tailspin they did in early 1985, when a red-hot market suddenly soured and end-users, who had hoarded hard-to-get chips during the boom, slashed orders and used up their inventories. </TEXT></DOC>
