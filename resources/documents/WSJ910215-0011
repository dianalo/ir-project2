While building up the world's fifth-largest militaryduring its war with Iran, Iraq obtained $5 billion in exportcredit guarantees from Washington to buy U.S. rice, wheat andother commodities. And come purchase time, Iraqi officialswheedled and bullied millions of dollars in cash and freegoods from the U.S. exporters vying for Iraqi business.</LP><TEXT>   To what end?   That's what Comet Rice Inc. of Los Angeles wondered whenit received a cable from Iraq in late 1987. In the midst oftheir huge military buildup, the cash-short Iraqis had a lotof miscellaneous bills piling up -- for &quot;spare parts,&quot; thatsort of thing. Would Comet pay some of those bills for theIraqis?   The rice supplier, eager to please so large a customer,agreed to pick up one $17,587 tab. But the company expressedqualms about sending $32,000 to another European partssupplier.   &quot;How can Comet be sure that you are receiving spare parts,and they are not military parts?&quot; a Comet executive asked theIraqi Grain Board in a Dec. 30, 1987, telex.   The Iraqi board was insulted. Regarding military parts, ithuffed in a reply, &quot;We are extremely sorry for what you havementioned.&quot; What's more, the board said, Comet wasn't alone:Other grain suppliers had already been asked for specialpayments.   No one is suggesting that the rice trade financed SaddamHussein's war machine. But the series of Comet Rice telexes,along with numerous other documents now being reviewed byU.S. officials, tell a story of what Baghdad demanded fromU.S. suppliers -- and, in many cases, received -- as it wascommitting its precious foreign exchange to its defenseindustries.   Typically, the Iraqis put the arm on exporters byrequesting them to make straight payoffs, or pay Iraqibusiness debts or provide freebies ranging from sewingmachines to pickup trucks.   Payments to grease the wheels of trade aren't uncommon inThird World countries. But in the last several years, theIraqis were unusually demanding. Exporters leery of makingthe payments were threatened with blacklisting.   U.S. government investigators are beginning to uncover theextent of what Rep. Charles Rose calls &quot;extortion&quot; andcorruption in sales to Iraq -- most of it financed with U.S.Agriculture Department export credit programs. &quot;The Iraqishave clearly extorted money from exporters,&quot; asserts Rep.Rose (D., N.C.), chairman of a House Government Operationssubcommittee that is investigating exports to Iraq. &quot;Itappears every single American company dealing with them wasasked for extra sales services. What we don't know is howmany companies came across.&quot;   The tip of the iceberg is evident in a very limited U.S.audit of eight exporters that hasn't been released. Threecompanies were found to have provided a total of $380,000 inpayments, goods and services to Iraq from October 1986through September 1989, according to government officials.They are Erly Industries Inc.'s Comet Rice Inc. unit, thegrain-trading giant Louis Dreyfus Corp. and Mitsui andamp; Co. USAInc., the U.S. arm of the Japanese trading firm Mitsui andamp; Co.Tobacco companies alone have already been caught makingpayments of $1.5 million to the Iraqi tobacco monopoly andconcealing them from the government.   Spokesmen for Louis Dreyfus and Mitsui decline to commentpending the results of government probes. &quot;We are voluntarilycooperating with the investigation,&quot; says the Mitsuiofficial. In Los Angeles, Erly Industries Chairman GeraldMurphy says he can't verify any of the payments. The ricesales to Iraq, he adds, were &quot;some of the cleanest businessI've ever seen.&quot;   With Iraqi munitions pointed at U.S. servicemen in thePersian Gulf, the issue is bound to become politicallyvolatile. Some lawmakers are convinced that some cash andequipment, including trucks and trailers supplied by otherexporters, were put to military use. The type oftractor-trailer rigs specified in one Iraqi cable &quot;could be amobile Scud launcher today,&quot; asserts Rep. Rose.   But while lawmakers speculate on the military effects, afederal grand jury in Atlanta is looking into the legalramifications. Iraq needed commercial credit to buycommodities -- bankers to provide the cash whose repaymentwould be insured by the U.S. credit guarantee programs. Forthis role, the Iraqis looked to a tiny Italian-owned bank inAtlanta -- Banca Nazionale del Lavoro -- which is caught upin a messy scandal over loans made without the approval ofthe head office in Rome.   In fact, more than $3 billion in unauthorized loans toIraq were funneled through the BNL branch-loans logged on&quot;gray books,&quot; according to Paul Von Wedel, a former BNL vicepresident. Half the total involved government-guaranteedcommodity loans. The grand jury is also investigating leadsthat much of the credit was used to buy high-technologyequipment and weapons.   The House Banking Committee, meanwhile, is focusing on thelack of regulatory vigilance by banking officials.Agriculture Department officials, for their part, are lookingat whether special payments to Iraqi agencies, though notillegal per se, were concealed in the &quot;port value&quot; of salesbeing guaranteed by the Department. If so, it is a criminalviolation that puts the U.S. taxpayer on the hook forguaranteed transactions beyond farm exports.   Six tobacco companies recently pleaded guilty in federalcourt in Raleigh, N.C., to misleading the government on morethan $1 million in after-sales payments made on behalf ofIraq. The companies were fined and agreed to pay restitution.Much of the money was wired to corporate bank accounts inAustria, Bulgaria, Italy and several other countries,supposedly to pay for the Iraqi tobacco monopoly's purchasesof cigarette-making supplies and equipment.   &quot;To the best of my knowledge, there weren't any black holepayments,&quot; says Edward Wilson, a Washington attorney forCasalee America Corp., a tobacco exporter that the governmentsaid paid out $494,000 at the behest of the Iraqis. &quot;Myclient thought the money was going for mundane and routinethings like cigarette paper, filters, spare parts,forklifts.&quot;   The roots of all this were geopolitical and economic. Inthe early 1980s, the U.S. foreign policy establishment sawIraq as a counterweight to Iran. Trade soon began toflourish. American agriculture, mired in the worst depressionsince the 1930s, was eager to sell off price-depressing cropsurpluses, while the cash-poor regime of Saddam Hussein wasdesperate for foreign credit. Commodity sales to Iraq underthe Agriculture Department credit guarantee programs soaredto $1.1 billion in fiscal 1989 from $365 million in fiscal1983 as the Foreign Agricultural Service bent its programrules to maximize exports. Almost a third of the $5 billiontotal was funneled through the 15-person BNL Atlanta office.   Spearheading the export push was Melvin Sims, generalsales manager at the Foreign Agricultural Service until March1989. &quot;In hindsight, I can see how people could be verycritical,&quot; says Mr. Sims. &quot;But if you refuse to do businesswith people because you suspect they might do somethingimproper in the future, your market would be greatlyreduced.&quot;   U.S. exporters soon discovered that Baghdad was lookingfor more than just commodities. In late 1987, Comet Riceexpressed concerns to the Iraqi Grain Board about being theonly company hit up for special payments -- what the Iraqisreferred to as &quot;after-sales services.&quot;   &quot;How can Comet be sure that you are being fair by chargingand receiving from our competitors an equal amount?&quot; a Cometexecutive asked the board in a Sept. 30, 1987, cable. Theboard, in an answering cable, informed Comet: &quot;We alreadyasked the other grain suppliers for after-sales services.&quot;   It was evident to U.S. exporters that they were gettingthe squeeze because the Iraqis lacked foreign exchange to buyspare parts and other essential items. Iraqi tobaccoofficials told exporters that they couldn't obtain enoughoperating funds &quot;because the government needed all availablefunds to continue its war with Iran,&quot; according to an auditreport.   Many U.S. exporters complied with Iraq's demands.According to U.S. officials, Mitsui provided Fax and copyingmachines, chemical compounds and watches, among other things,totaling $251,000; Comet paid $50,000 in &quot;consulting fees,&quot;chipped in on the purchase of seven pickup trucks, one landcruiser, calculators and other items for a total of $95,000;and Louis Dreyfus provided $34,000 in fumigants andlaboratory equipment.   The Iraqis were exceptionally blunt in their demands. InAugust 1989, the Iraqi trading company for constructionmaterials sent cables to several U.S. wood exporters withthis order: &quot;Furnish our company (free of charge) repeat(free of charge) trucks or trailers.&quot;   Three pages of the cable were devoted to specifyingprecisely what type of trucks and trailers the Iraqisdesired. Their list of specs included Michelin tires,vibration-free mirrors, tropical batteries, leatherette seatcovers and a 25-ton jack. &quot;Any negative reply&quot; will lead to&quot;your company (being) blacklisted,&quot; the Iraqi companythreatened.   &quot;These telexes were sent to everybody who did businesswith Iraq,&quot; says Kalevi Turkia, head of Lincoln Kaltek, anAtlanta trading company. &quot;We were alarmed about this. Wedidn't want to be blackmailed.&quot; Mr. Turkia balked at shippingvehicles, but government investigators believe others didn't.   Furthermore, Agriculture Department auditors have evidencethat exporters of tobacco and other commodities inflatedtheir prices to the Iraqis in order to recoup the costs ofpayments, thus increasing U.S. government exposure on theguaranteed loans to Baghdad.   At least $1 million was wired by tobacco companies toforeign corporations in Korea and Europe -- including$333,000 to Bulgartabac Co. in Bulgaria -- purportedly forcigarette-making supplies and parts, according to the audit.   Government investigators and others don't rule out thepossibility that some of the money was diverted into weaponsand high-technology purchases. In trying to follow the moneytrail, they repeatedly were denied access to books andrecords of overseas companies.   &quot;Money could have been passed forward,&quot; says Mr. Wilson,an attorney for Casalee America, the tobacco exporter.</TEXT></DOC>
