 That'saccording to information managers at the Albany Medical Center (AMC) inAlbany, N.Y.andM;AMC has recently installed and interconnected several new systems that willaddress the problem of improving the integration of administrative andpatient-care information in the hospital and teaching complex that make upthe Center.andM;At the hub of AMC's Patient Information Network (PIN) is a Hewlett-PackardCo. 9000 UNIX-based minicomputer running software from Libra HealthTechnology, a subsidiary of Libra Systems Inc.andP;  HP's machine is linked viapoint-to-point connections with Digital Equipment Corp. and IBM Corp.andO;computers in AMC's medical records, laboratory, radiology and pharmacydepartments.andM;The hub computer is also wired to two other new systems.andP;  One, based on aDigital VAX 8810, transmits Centerwide patient identification data; andadmission, discharge and transfer (ADT) information to the departments.andP;  Thissystem uses IDX Corp. software.andM;The other, using software from Second Foundation Inc., enables doctors tosend orders to, and receive results from, various departments dealing withpatient care.andP;  This system connects HP 9000s and HP Vectra PCs over a localarea network wired to IEEE 802.3 standards.andP;  One of the 9000 machines, actingas a master node for this subsystem, is connected to the PIN.andM;A number of factors lay behind AMC's interest in improving its datacommunications capabilities.andM;&quot;Hospitals around the country face growing pressure from federal and stategovernments to increase the efficiency of their health care services,&quot; saysStanley Dziuban, M.D., AMC's director of medical informatics.andP;  &quot;That meansmore regulations and review by public bodies and, consequently, more reportswe have to make.&quot;andM;The medical information glutandM;At the same time, the variety and amount of medical data generated inhospitals are rising due, in part, to the complex and expensive medical needsof an increasingly elderly population.andP;  Adding to the data load at AMC is thefact that doctors at such teaching and research facilities tend to order moretests than at other hospitals.andM;Moreover, industry studies indicate that approximately one-third of a nurse'stime is spent in dealing with paperwork.andP;  &quot;There's a real need to use suchtime more efficiently than that, especially when the nation faces a seriousnursing shortage,&quot; says Dziuban.andM;Tracking the patientandM;Several specific problem areas at AMC, although not unique to thatinstitution, also impeded optimal use of Center resources and staff time.andM;For example, a patient could find himself giving the same demographic data(name, address and so forth) plus insurance information, first to theadmissions clerk and then to each department at AMC he might have to visit.andO;And, according to Bill Montgomery, vice president of information managementat the Center, if the patient returned six months later, he could have tostart from scratch.andM;It was also not easy to keep track of health-care services an individual mayhave received at different departments, or even to get test results to adoctor on a timely basis.andP;  All lab tests ordered one day were usuallycompleted by early the next morning.andP;  But printouts of the results would notreach the appropriate floors until later in the day, and it could take up toseveral days before a doctor was able to sort out his patient's test datafrom the pile.andM;Inefficient procedures were also present on the clinical side at AMC.andP;  TheCenter estimated, for instance, that 25 steps might be required to order anurgent laboratory test, including making phone calls, tracking down patientcharts and the like.andP;  AMC estimated that most of these steps could beeliminated by integrating health-care information.andM;What the Center needed was a system that captured isolated pockets ofinformation about patients for inclusion in their medical records.andP;  Suchdocuments would provide information about nursing care plans, ADT processes,test results and other factors.andP;  ADT data also had to be available towhatever sections of the Center the patient might be involved with at anygiven time.andM;No one vendor would doandM;AMC proceeded by forming a 40-member Clinical Information Advisory Committeein 1986.andP;  Over a two-year period, this group carried out a needs assessmentand issued a request for information that went to 62 medical-informationvendors.andM;During this time, the Center considered the possibility of putting in a new,comprehensive system that would address all its patient identification andclinical information needs.andP;  It was clear by the end of theinformation-gathering phase, however, that no one vendor could supply all thenecessary equipment and software.andM;&quot;We couldn't even agree among ourselves on a vendor who could handle both theadministrative and patient health-care functions we wanted, let alone tie inthe departments to these systems,&quot; says Montgomery.andP;  &quot;Moreover, strongvendors in this field tend to have niche markets.andP;  Thus, the best clinicalsystem we saw couldn't provide the patient administrative functions, such asappointment scheduling, at the scale we needed for the institutions.&quot;andM;In addition, each department feeding information into a patient-care systemwanted the computer system best at processing information related to itsspecialty.andP;  This is true even where these systems were not necessarily ableto share data easily or efficiently.andM;For instance, the pharmacy at AMC uses pharmacy-management system softwarefrom Baxter Healthcare Corp. running on an IBM AS/400.andP;  A Digital PDP 11/44with ADAC Laboratories software held the radiology department process datafrom X-rays.andP;  A third system consisting of a VAX 8350 and SunquestInformation Systems software handles information derived from blood tests andother procedures performed in ACM's laboratory.andM;As a result of these considerations, AMC decided to implement a decentralizednetwork design that allowed the departments to maintain their individualsystems, while the Center added components on a piecemeal basis required tomeet the needs of the institution as a whole.andP;  All these elements would, inturn, be interconnected in a simple manner to facilitate and managedata-sharing among the Center's constituents: physicians, nurses,administrators and technicians.andM;AMC also decided not to hire an outside systems integrator to obtain andinstall the equipment it needed.andP;  &quot;We felt that nobody had the experiencethat matched our desire to integrate Centerwide patient administrativeinformation with data derived from clinical tests,&quot; says Montgomery.andP;  &quot;So wedefined system needs ourselves and hired Libra to handle the interfacesbetween whatever disparate systems would be required.andP;  Other vendors willhave to provide links to those interfaces.&quot;andM;Testing a touch systemandM;The IDX system for registering and identifying patients was the first newcomponent put in place, because of its central importance.andP;  &quot;If patientsdon't get identified properly, we cannot systemize the rest of theinformation needed to build a consistent medical record,&quot; notes Montgomery.andM;With the IDX program, there is a clerk at whichever AMC unit a patient firstmakes contact, who automatically checks the patient-administrative system tosee if he's previously been involved with the Center.andP;  If not, the clerktakes down the necessary basic information and Health Information Servicesassigns a medical record number immediately.andM;Installing Second Foundation's ProTouch patient-care information system hasbeen a more intricate job for AMC because of the dramatic changes it portendsin the routine operations of the medical staff.andP;  This system is now beingevaluated in a 38-bed clinical unit specializing in blood disorders andcancer.andP;  If all goes well, AMC intends to implement the system over atwo-year period on a hospitalwide basis.andM;The ProTouch system enables care givers with the appropriate clearance toorganize and access patient information on a continuously updated electronicmedical chart by using touch-screen Vectra workstations.andP;  Such informationcan include diagnoses, health histories, nursing care plans and initialwork-up results.andM;In addition, by touching hospital-specified clinical phrases on the screen,physicians can &quot;write&quot; orders for transmission to the lab, pharmacy andradiology departments, view the results of these orders and generatepatient-management work lists.andM;Second Foundation anticipates a number of benefits from this sytem, besidesits basic convenience.andP;  For instance, industry studies indicate thatpaper-based patient charts are unavailable 25 percent to 50 percent of thetime when they are needed by the attending doctor or nurse.andP;  Thus, thecontinuing availability of an electronic medical record promises to freesubstantial time for direct patient care that care givers otherwise put intowaiting or searching for charts.andM;Unlike systems communicateandM;Libra's LIFENET software system makes the patient network possible by linkingtransactions flowing from the ADT and patient-care systems with informationgenerated by the laboratory, radiology and pharmacy departments.andP;  LIFENETdoes this through its Data-Distribution module, which includes a relationaldatabase and data-translation tables.andM;&quot;As a result of our data-mapping and translating capabilities, LIFENET allowsthe dissimilar systems to use their own standard ways of communicating witheach other,&quot; says Kathleen Hornung, vice president of sales and services atLibra.andP;  &quot;Thus, messages are sent to, say, Baxter's pharmacy system in theformat required by Baxter.andP;  This is significantly different from the formatsent to LIFENET by IDX'S ADT system.andP;  The data, however, is understandable toeach system, without the preparation of additional software interfacesbetween them.andP;  That, in turn, saves AMC time and money.&quot;andM;LIFENET supports asynchronous and bisynchronous devices, as well as TCP/IPand X.25 protocol.andP;  An external protocol converter is needed only when goingbetween IBM and asynchronous machines, such as the HP computer runningLIFENET.andM;The Second Foundation's patient-care system has a similar data-translationfeature between ProTouch and the clinical systems with which it communicates.andM;The physical network consists of hardwired, point-to-point connectionsbetween each PIN component, including the Libra hub, and a data PBX providedby Equinox Systems Inc.andP;  Transmissions can take place at either 9.6 kilobitsor 19.2 kilobits per second.andP;  &quot;This design was used simply because LIFENETsoftware was originally written to run on a Plexus box, and Plexus did notsupport a local area network such as Ethernet,&quot; says Montgomery.andP;  &quot;Ethernetdoes link most other computers at AMC, and our goal is to get PIN on thatsystem as well.&quot;andM;A typical transaction flow through PIN might go as follows.andP;  When anindividual checks into the hospital, the IDX system sends out a transactionsaying that he was admitted.andP;  Libra picks up that information and forwards itto other parts of the network, tailoring it to meet the needs of eachdepartment.andP;  For instance, says Libra's Hornung: &quot;The admissions system maycapture some 200 data elements, such as the patient's name, room location,doctor's name and so on.andP;  The pharmacy system needs only 20 such elements.andO;The relational database in LIFENET knows who is supposed to get what.&quot;andM;Similarly, the lab system wants to receive inpatient data in a differentformat and noted differently from outpatient data.andP;  But the admissions systemmakes no such discrimination.andP;  &quot;Libra can determine the patient's status fromthe information received from admissions and send it out in the appropriateformat,&quot; says Hornung.andM;Moreover, if the patient reaches a ward equipped with ProTouch, an electronicmedical chart will be open and waiting with the appropriate demographicinformation obtained at admissions.andP;  The nurse can then proceed with aninitial assessment, check of vital functions and care-plan formulation.andM;If the physician wishes to order a blood test, he presses the relevant phraseon the workstation.andP;  ProTouch codes the transmission and translates it into aformat suitable for the Sunquest laboratory system.andP;  Libra transports themessage to Sunquest.andP;  The order then goes into the lab computer tagged withthe patient's medical record number, and is included in the lab technician'swork order that is printed out every morning.andP;  The technician obtains theblood and logs in that fact on the computer, which passes this information toLibra.andP;  The attending doctor can thus see the status of his order at anytime.andM;When the test is completed, the results go on the same data path from the labcomputer back to ProTouch, where they are automatically inserted into themedical record for review by the doctor or nurse.andP;  Some lab instruments, suchas the Coulter Counter, which counts red and white blood cells, interfacedirectly to the lab computer and can flag abnormal test values for attentionwhen they are sent into the medical record.andM;When the patient is discharged, his medical record is retained in an archivenode of the ProTouch system for later retrieval upon any return visit.andM;Several limits to PIN's capabilities and reach point the way toward possibleevolution of this system and the technology on which it relies.andP;  Forinstance, writing progress notes on a patient's chart is a typical part ofthe caregiver's routine.andP;  However, this task has not yet been automated onthe patient-care system at AMC.andP;  &quot;It was a massive enough job to codifymedical test orders and health-care planning options in ProTouch menuchoices,&quot; says AMC's Dziuban.andP;  &quot;We were not yet ready to work up a phraselibrary of the textual descriptions used in progress notes, though that maybe done eventually.&quot;andM;In addition, specialized medical services at the Center are spread among some40 departments.andP;  The three included initially in PIN were chosen because theyperform a higher volume of tests and services than the others, which includenuclear medicine, respiratory therapy and pulmonary functions.andP;  Moreover,some medical equipment, such as EKG machines, produces biological waveformsthat can be analyzed by, but not yet directly transmitted between, computers.andM;Charges and notations of hospital activities are transferred tape-to-tape,rather than being sent directly from PIN to IBM computers in the financedepartment.andP;  AMC plans for conversion of the process to the network laterthis year.andM;Finally, data derived from sensors attached to the body do not go directlyinto electronic medical records, but must be entered manually.andP;  Hookingmonitoring instruments into the patient-care system and Libra is a major goalof AMC that depends, in part, on the evolution of medical data communicationsstandards.andM;Even so, &quot;AMC has been very forward-thinking in integrating the data it hasinto an electronic medical record, while protecting the investments thedepartments have made in existing computer systems,&quot; says Steve Koerper,manager of research and development at Hewlett-Packard's Health CareInformation Systems.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
