The microphysicalformulation follows the so-called bulk technique. With this procedurethe net production rates in the balance equations for water and potentialtemperature are given both for liquid and ice-phase. Convectively stableas well as convectively unstable mesoscale systems are considered. With2 figs..</TEXT></DOC>
