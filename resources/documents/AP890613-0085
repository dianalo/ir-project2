The meeting comes four weeks after Poland had its freest and mostcompetitive elections under communist rule.   The Hungarian talks are to set the stage for free elections thatwill be held by mid-1990 at the latest.   Communist Party leader Karoly Grosz told the evening daily EstiHirlap today that the talks mark ``an important step'' in theparty's development since a party conference in May 1988, when Groszreplaced longtime party leader Janos Kadar and avid reformers werebrought into the party leadership.   He led the Communist Party's delegation, which also includedPolitburo reformer Imre Pozsgay and Gyoergy Fejti, who has been incharge of preliminary exchanges with the opposition.   Peter Toelgyessy, a spokesman, was quoted by the paper as sayingthe opposition's aim at the talks was to lead the country to thefirst free elections.   ``We don't want to make final decisions above the people'sheads,'' he was quoted as saying. ``We want to use the negotiationsto decide the rules to be followed in the democratic transition.''   The talks were opened by parliament speaker Matyas Szueros, whopresided over the opening round in Budapest's ornate parliamentbuilding and briefly addressed the negotiators.   In an earlier statement, Szueroes said the talks would probablybe ``decisive for the direction and speed'' of transformation to amulti-party system, the state news agency MTI reported.   The government and opposition on Saturday agreed to hold thetalks.   Also participating are the official trade unions and theleft-wing Ferenc Muennich Society, which opposes a change in theone-party system. The nine opposition groups initially wanted theCommunist Party organizations left out of the meetings but lateragreed to their participation.   Budapest's party chief, Mihaly Jasso, in an interview publishedtoday warned of a possible split within the party brought on byreforms. He said in the case of a split, the party would likely``fall to pieces.''   Communist Party leader Grosz told a weekend meeting of communistsin the city of Gyoer that a ``real danger'' of a split exists.   Grosz said there were differences among party factions over thepace of reforms and Hungary's foreign policy orientation.</TEXT></DOC>
