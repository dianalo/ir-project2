The action represents a sharp turnaround for the FCC, which has strongly pursued telecommunications deregulation. &quot;It's virtually unprecedented,&quot; said Bruce Fein, a former FCC general counsel. He said the agency's &quot;theme has been, 'Let's remove government interference from the marketplace.'&quot;    Specifically, the commission voted 5-0 to seek comment on a proposal to reimpose its so-called syndicated exclusivity rule. The rule, eliminated in 1980, would give local broadcasters the exclusive right to show syndicated programs in their area.    Currently, cable systems, which carry television stations from different markets, may show several versions of the same syndicated show. WRIV-TV in Houston, for instance, airs the show &quot;Facts of Life&quot; at 5 p.m. daily, the same time as the local cable system shows &quot;Facts of Life&quot; from WGN in Chicago. Thomas Herwitz, vice president of Fox Television Stations Inc., which owns WRIV, said the overlap amounts to &quot;grand larceny.&quot;    The proposal would have the most effect on programs broadcast by WGN and a handful of other so-called superstations, whose signals are transmitted by satellite to cable systems nationwide, syndication executives said. Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s WTBS in Atlanta is the largest such superstation, reaching more than 35 million homes. Cable systems currently reach about half of the 87.4 million U.S. homes with televisions.    In Atlanta, Turner Broadcasting said it would have no comment on the FCC vote until its attorneys have reviewed the proposal.    In addition, the FCC voted 5-0 to seek comment on whether it should recommend that Congress eliminate the so-called compulsory license. This license allows cable operators to re-transmit programs from broadcast television by paying cut-rate fees to a federal copyright agency that distributes the money to copyright owners, usually Hollywood studios.    James Mooney, president of the National Cable Television Association, said compulsory licenses enable cable operators to carry programming they otherwise couldn't get. &quot;When the Red Sox are hot, people all over New England look to cable systems as a means of watching the Red Sox,&quot; he said.    But the Motion Picture Association of America, which represents copyright holders, plans to push for the repeal of compulsory licenses. It argues that cable operators aren't paying enough for programming. Instead, the association wants to be able to negotiate prices for programs with individual cable operators.    Rep. Robert Kastenmeier (D., Wis.), chairman of the House subcommittee that oversees copyright matters, said compulsory licenses protect small cable companies that aren't able to negotiate effectively with major studios. &quot;A compelling case would have to be made to run over the cable industry and take away its compulsory license,&quot; Mr. Kastenmeier said.    The FCC's proposals are outgrowths of its plan to require cable television operators to carry some local broadcast stations for five years. After those so-called must carry rules are eliminated, the agency believes, cable operators won't need special treatment.    FCC Chairman Mark Fowler said the rule changes are necessary to let broadcasters compete fairly with cable operators. Commissioner Dennis Patrick, who is slated to take over as chairman sometime this spring, added: &quot;Deregulation isn't a single, bottom-line issue. Sometimes it's necessary to impose a regulation to facilitate competition.&quot;    Separately, the FCC said it wouldn't intervene in the home satellite dish market. Dish owners have complained that they must pay high prices to get such services as HBO and the Movie Channel, which have begun scrambling their signals.    But the agency said decoder boxes now are readily available for about $400, and it added that competition should lead to price reductions for scrambled cable programs. The FCC said it would monitor the home-dish market quarterly for the next year. </TEXT></DOC>
