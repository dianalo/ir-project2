Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng set the new support price at $10.60 a hundredweight, the lowest level in a decade. The reduction amounts to roughly one penny a quart.    Mr. Lyng acted under the Food Security Act of 1985, which requires a reduction in the milk-support price on New Year's Day if dairy surpluses of five billion pounds or more are projected for 1988.    The department's economists said that retail prices for milk, cheese and butter in 1988 could decline or rise 1% to 2% from 1987. Overall food prices are expected to rise 2% to 4% next year.    The nation's dairy farms produced an estimated 142 billion pounds of milk in 1987, down about 1% from last year. However, despite the lower support price, economists expect milk production to increase to 145.5 billion pounds in 1988.    The government has been gradually lowering the support price since 1983, when it was $13.10 a hundredweight, to discourage overproduction in New York, Wisconsin, Minnesota and other dairy states.    As a result of the new price, the government will cut the prices it pays for surplus dairy products. Beginning tomorrow, butter will bring $1.32 a pound, a reduction of 3.75 cents. Block cheddar cheese will bring $1.1525 a pound, down 4.75 cents, while barrel cheese will bring $1.1125 a pound, down 4.5 cents. The government will pay 72.75 cents a pound for non-fat dry milk, down four cents.    Separately, Mr. Lyng outlined how the government plans to assess dairy farmers 2.5 cents for every hundred pounds of milk they market, as required by the budget-reconciliation law enacted last week. The so-called dairy assessment is designed to raise $57 million as part of the federal government's overall deficit-cutting effort. Generally, dairies and other bulk buyers will deduct the assessment from payments to farmers and send it to the government. </TEXT></DOC>
