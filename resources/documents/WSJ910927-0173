Even a battery of lawyers accompanied by two city policeofficers couldn't pull off a corporate ouster here last weekat Partners Oil Co.</LP><TEXT>   The company's downtown offices were &quot;occupied&quot; for fourhours by a shareholder group described by management as&quot;insurgents.&quot;   Although the bloodless coup has become stalemated in anexchange of lawsuits, at least the insurgents have gone homefor now. &quot;It was like having a massacre and they ran out ofbullets,&quot; said James E. Kirkland, an executive vice presidentand a director.   The opposition forces were demanding the removal of allboard members and a halt to the proposed sale of acontrolling interest in the oil concern.   The Partners Oil coup attempt began with a flourish at 11a.m. last Friday. Flinging open the doors to the company'sbrown, beige and green 12th floor conference room, ErrolKing, a California investor and coup ringleader, said tothree astonished company officers, &quot;I want you to meet someof my friends.&quot;   Moving quickly, Mr. King announced that his group heldmore than 50% of Partner's common shares. &quot;You are all firedas directors of the company, and we are electing a new boardof directors consisting of three,&quot; said Mr. King, accordingto Mr. Kirkland. Mr. King also fired the company's legalcounsel and five other directors in absentia.   The three Partners Oil officers, including E. RalphDaniel, chairman, president and chief executive officer, werespeechless. Mr. King's attendance was expected, but it wassupposed to be &quot;just a routine visit,&quot; said Mr. Kirkland, wholater offered a play-by-play account.   A discussion lasting several hours ensued as the threecompany officers, only two of whom are directors, stood theirground. One uniformed Houston policeman accompanied Mr. Kinginto the conference room to referee, while another officerstood guard just outside the door.   The police were off-duty mercenaries hired by the rebels.Although there were no television stations to commandeer, asin some coups, the dissidents wanted &quot;to secure the recordsand assets of the company,&quot; said a spokesman for the group.   Mr. King's group, which totaled 18, read from a decreeordering five new keys for the office, including onepresumably for Mr. King, and dictated that nothing be removedfrom the downtown corporate suite.   Finally, the embattled Partners Oil officers &quot;came to oursenses and asked to leave the room to make a phone call,&quot; Mr.Kirkland said. The call summoned the company's legal counsel.   Mr. King's opposition forces retreated about 3 p.m. Fridayafternoon. Claims to the conference room turf, board seatsand ability to depose current management are all in dispute,however, because Partners Oil's transfer agent calculates thedissidents hold less than half of the company's 2.4 millionshares outstanding.   Now, the company and the insurgents are suing each otherin state and federal courts. Mr. King couldn't be reached forcomment. A spokesman for Realty Alliance of Texas Ltd., amajor shareholder in Mr. King's brigade, said that &quot;theallegations are without merit, and they will be contestedvigorously.&quot;   At issue in the dispute is a plan by Partners Oil to raiseworking capital, in part by purchasing certain producingproperties in exchange for a 51% interest in the company.&quot;We're trying to keep an oil company alive,&quot; Mr. Kirklandsaid. Partners reported a $203,000 net loss on revenue of$4.4 million last year.   Earlier this week -- in a post-coup maneuver -- PartnersOil quietly signed a definitive agreement for thattransaction.</TEXT></DOC>
