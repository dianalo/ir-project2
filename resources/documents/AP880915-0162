The experiment is noteworthy because federal courts, unlike manyof their state counterparts, ban all electronic coverage ofcourtroom proceedings.   The Judicial Conference, a 28-judge board which sets policy forthe nation's federal courts, approved the two-year videotapingexperiment in a closed meeting Wednesday, spokesman David Sellerssaid.   The experiment, to be conducted in six trial courts and twoappeals courts, is patterned after a program already in place inKentucky state courts.   The conference wants to find out whether whether videotapesshould replace written documents as official records of trial andappellate court proceedings.   During the experiment, videotaping will supplement astenographic record.   Public access to the videotapes is ``something that has not beendetermined yet,'' Sellers said.   The experiment will be monitored by a committee led by U.S.District Judge Richard M. Bilby of Tucson, Ariz.   Sellers said no final decision had been made on which courtswill use the videotapes, but he said federal trial judges inPhiladelphia have expressed interest. Participation of a federaltrial court in Arizona was possible because of Judge Bilby's role,Sellers said.   The judicial conference also reported that it is asking Congressto create 73 new judgeships to eliminate backlogs and easeworkloads. But Sellers said, ``The realities are that nothing willhappen during an election year.''   The last increase in the judicial workforce was in 1984 whenCongress authorized creation of 86 judgeships.   The conference is seeking 14 new appeals court judges and 59trial judges, but 22 of the trial judgeships would last only fiveyears.   The conference in 1986 sought 56 additional trial court judgesand 13 appeals court judges _ a proposal that went nowhere inCongress.   There currently are 158 appeals court judges and 548 trialjudges.   Sellers said the Judicial Conference also approved spending$70,000 to $90,000 on closed-circuit television cameras to monitor``high risk'' trials.   He said stationary cameras capable of scanning a courtroom willbe installed in 10 or 12 major cities. The cameras will provide avideo monitor feed to a marshal's office.   The U.S. Marshals Service proposed the security measure.</TEXT></DOC>
