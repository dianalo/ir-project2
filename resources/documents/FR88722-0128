This is a demonstration program. The purpose of the programis to design and test a strategy that encourages and guides community comprehensiveprogram development and planning for missing and exploited children. Theprogram will provide specific guidance regarding programmatic, policy andprocedural approaches; and, community organization and planning activitiesthat assist local communities in responding to their missing and exploitedchildren problems and service needs. Through this program a variety ofactivities will be initiated, and numerous products will be prepared. Theseare explained in Section III, Program Strategy. Two of the primary productswill be: A <T3>program guide </T3>that describes effective programmatic responsesto parental and non-parental abduction and the exploitation of runaways;and, a <T3>community action guide </T3>that explains community organization andplanning processes. These processes include convening appropriate decisionmakers, assessing community problems and resources, reviewing recommendationscontained in the program guide, and designing, implementing and monitoringa systemwide strategy for providing services for missing and exploitedchildren.This announcement is cognizant of the fact that while resources alreadyexist within medium to large sized jurisdictions to provide services enumeratedin section 406(a), these services are often incomplete, nor do they necessarilyreflect the state-of-the-art with respect to required services. This programin part is designed to identify those programs which are among the mostpromising while encouraging a process for their systematic coordinationwithin communities to facilitate a comprehensive, coordinated, and effectivedelivery system. The suggested program strategies will emphasize strengtheningthe family unit, as appropriate, as well as, using volunteers in all aspectsof the juvenile justice service system's response to the problem. OJJDPdemonstration programs contain four discrete sequential stages. The initialthree stages will be implemented by the recipient during the first eighteenmonths of this program. The three states are: <T3>Assessment, </T3>a review and assessment of information on community-basedprograms and practices, and on planning and development processes, relatedto missing and exploited children; <T3>manual development, </T3>the design of detailed operational informationon selected effective programs and planning processes identified duringthe assessment process; and, <T3>training/technical assistance, </T3>the development of training andtechnical assistance materials to transfer the information contained inthe manuals to local demonstration sites. The final stage, <T3>replication, </T3>the provision of training, technical assistance andlimited financial assistance to demonstration sites, may be implementedin approximately eighteen months following the successful completion ofthe initial three stages.Public agencies and not-for-profit organizations are invited to submitapplications to enter into a cooperative agreement with OJJDP. OPJJDP willselect the applicant that presents the most cost-effective approach andbest demonstrates the organizational capability, knowledge, and experienceto conduct a multi-site demonstration program. The project period is threeyears. OJJDP has allocated up to $400,000 for the first 18 months and initialthree stages of this program. Based on successful completion of the firstbudget period, a non-competing continuation award is anticipated. Applicantsare encouraged to submit cost competitive proposals. The deadline for thereceipt of applications is August 22, 1988. The competition will be conductedaccording to the OJJDP Competition and Peer Review Policy, 28 CFR Part34, Subpart A published August 2, 1985 at 50 FR 31365-31367.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>For Further Information Contact:</T2> Robert O.

Introduction and Background</ITAG>Missing and exploited children suffer from varied forms of victimization.The importance of paying attention to a child absent from his or her homehas important consequences, no matter what reason may be attached to theabsence.Every child deserves protection from victimization particularly those involvedin parental and non-parental abduction or exploitation as a result of beinga runaway. Having a child missing from the security of the home or subjectedto the physical and mental anguish associated with exploitation is intolerable.In recent years, the public has demanded that greater attention be givento crimes against children, particularly those crimes related to abductionand exploitation. Coordination and cooperation among agencies and individualsat all levels in the child-serving system are critically needed to preventthese tragedies.The Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP) considersthe program approach outlined in this solicitation to be the most effectiveand timely way to provide, states and localities nationally, guidance inhow to respond effectively to the problems and needs of missing and exploitedchildren in their communities, particularly given the limited financialresources currently available.We are all becoming more aware that child exploitation can and will producemore than cuts and bruises. Research has documented a link between sexualassault victimization of pre-adolescent males and females and their consequentfuture involvement in assaultive (sexual and otherwise) violent and self-destructivebehavior. It becomes important, therefore, to establish and institutionalizean information linked, systems approach that coordinates the participationof police, schools, juvenile intake, prosecutors, judges, corrections andcommunity mental/medical health authorities into a timely, responsibleand resource effective response.The Attorney General's Advisory Board on Missing Children has identifieda number of recommendations to improve the safety and protection of childreninvolved in parental and non-parental abduction and the exploitation thatresults from being a runaway, as well as the systems that serve them andtheir families. These recommendations constitute elements of a plan toattack the nationwide problem of missing and exploited children. Selectedrecommendations are delineated below to guide the program development activitiesthat are the focus of this solicitation.andbullet; The crime of parental kidnapping demands greater attention fromthe criminal justice system. Prompt investigation and vigorous prosecutionof parental kidnapping cases should be encouraged.andbullet; To reduce the incidence of missing and exploited children andto ensure an effective response when incidents do occur, communities shoulddevelop juvenile service policies in a number of critical areas. Theseare:andbullet; Prompt law enforcement investigation of missing child reports.At least 27 states have eliminated the arbitrary waiting periods that delaypursuit of missing children investigation.andbullet; Training for law enforcement and child-serving professionals inthe investigation of child sexual abuse and exploitation in regard to missingchildren.andbullet; Community action policies should involve requirements for backgroundchecks for those working with children.andbullet; Juvenile service agencies, especially in the juvenile justicearea, should be adaptive to a coordinated and comprehensive case managementprocess with regard to child exploitation and cases going before the courts.andbullet; Community action groups should endeavor to continue their searchfor constitutionally valid ways to alleviate the trauma and intimidationthat many children experience in court when they must continually repeatthe details of the incident, face the assailant, and undergo cross-examination.andbullet; Local agencies should adopt practices that require parents, guardians,and schools to promptly report missing children. These procedures alsoshould require that law enforcement agencies report disappearances to theFBI's National Crime Information Center (NCIC).andbullet; Schools should be responsible for both transferring and receivingstudent records from old schools to new schools so that concealing missingchildren will be more difficult. In addition to school records, birth recordsshould be included in the transfer.andbullet; Privacy and confidentiality laws should be carefully examined.Family court judges or magistrates should be encouraged to allow appropriatepersons to access and exchange critical information in missing and exploitedchildren cases.andbullet; The police, courts, welfare departments, and schools need to cooperatein thoroughly investigating cases of missing children.andbullet; Crimes of parental and non parental abduction and the exploitationof runaways should be promptly investigated and vigorously prosecuted.andbullet; Judicial sentences should reflect a concern for the continuinghealth and safety of the child victim, his or her family, and other potentialvictims.andbullet; Public awareness programs should be reviewed both to ensure thatchildren, parents, teachers, and other adults receive a balanced perspectiveon the issue of missing children and to teach them ways to identify andprevent abuse, exploitation, and abduction.andbullet; Workable guidelines for dealing with cases of missing childrenshould be adopted in every community.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Program Goals and Objectives</ITAG>A. Goals1. To identify and assess promising and effective community organization,planning strategies and procedures for responding to the needs of missingand exploited children;2. To provide the capability to selected localities to implement programsin the context of effective community organization and planning strategiesfor responding to the needs of missing and exploited children; and,3. To disseminate promising and effective program and planning strategiesfor responding to needs of missing and exploited children.B. ObjectivesThe specific objectives enumerated below are offered pursuant to section406(a) of the Missing Children's Act. Specifically sections 1-4, and 6.1. Assess existing research and programs that: a. Educate parents, childrenand community agencies and organizations in ways to prevent the abductionand sexual exploitation of children;b. Provide information and activities that will be of assistance in locatingand returning missing and exploited children;c. Aid communities in collecting and providing information to parents andothers in the identification of missing children;d. Increase knowledge of treatment and support services and communicatethem to the families whose child has been abducted; both during the periodof disappearance and after the child is recovered.e. Address the particular needs of missing children by minimizing the negativeimpact of judicial and law enforcement procedures on children who are victimsof exploitation and by promoting the active participation of children andtheir families in cases involving the exploitation of children.2. Develop operational implementation manuals based on the assessmentsperformed under Objective 1. (a)-(e).3. Develop training and technical assistance materials to transfer theprogram technology identified under Objective 1. (a)-(e).4. Provide training and technical assistance to selected sites to demonstratethe program approaches and the planning strategies. (Applicants are advisedthat this stage of the demonstration program initiative will not be fundedduring the initial funding period. However, demonstration of the programis one of the primary objectives of this initiative).<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Program Strategy</ITAG>OJJDP planning and program development activities are guided by a frameworkwhich specifies four sequential phases of development: Research, development,demonstration and dissemination.The purpose of the demonstration phase is to identify promising or effectiveprogram activities and planning strategies and to implement the strategiesand program approaches in selected jurisdictions in order to demonstratetheir feasibility and effectiveness to the field.OJJDP demonstration programs are developed incrementally in four discretestages: (1) Assessment; (2) operational manual development; (3) trainingand technical assistance development; and, (4) training, financial andtechnical assistance to demonstration sites. This solicitation calls forcompletion of the <T3>demonstration </T3>phase of the development process in order to assistthe juvenile justice system in designing and implementing more effectivestrategies and programs for handling missing and exploited children. Thepurpose of this demonstration is to identify operational promising or effectivemulti-agency community organization and planning strategies, as well asspecific program approaches and procedures for handling missing and exploitedchildren, and demonstrate those strategies and program approaches in selectedsites.An advisory committee established specifically for this program will providecomments and recommendations to the recipient regarding the program strategyand activities. It may be necessary to change or supplement advisory committeemembers for different stages of the program. The advisory committee memberswill have combined expertise in missing and exploited children, communityorganization and planning, research and program evaluation, training andtechnical assistance delivery, and experience and knowledge of communityyouth services delivery systems. Each stage of the incremental demonstrationprocess is designed to result in a complete and publishable product (e.g.,final demonstration report) and a dissemination strategy to inform thefield of the development of the program, and the results and products ofeach stage. A decision will be made at the completion of each stage, basedon availability of funds and the quality and utility of the products, whetherto invest additional funds to complete the current stage or terminate theprogram.<ITAG tagnum="81">Stage 1_Assessment </ITAG>The first stage of the program consists of an assessment of programs andinformation related to the planning, development, implementation and operationof missing and exploited children programs (as defined in II, B).The recipient will develop criteria for identifying promising approachesto organizing appropriate community decision makers, and planning, developingand implementing programs for responding to the needs of missing and exploitedchildren. The criteria will be used to select programs for review and documentation.Information to be collected and assessed should include, at a minimum,the historical development of the program; conceptual framework/theoreticalassumptions; number and type of youth served; program costs per unit ofservice and per client; evaluation findings; sources of funding; staffingrequirements; and program approach to management and administration. The assessment should provide the basis for selecting the programs mostappropriate for demonstration. The assessment phase may reveal that manyprograms have very effective components, but there are none that meet themajority of the criteria at a sufficient level to justify nationwide demonstration.If this is the case, an additional developmental phase may be initiatedto design prototypical programs based on the best information availablethrough the assessment and other sources. Evaluation issues that shouldbe addressed through the demonstration program should also be identified.<T3>Activities</T3>_The major activities of this stage are: 1. Establishmentof the advisory committee;2. Development of the assessment plan;3. Review of the literature;4. Development of criteria for identifying promising programs;5. Identification and description of operational promising programs;6. Preparation of assessment report; and,7. Development and implementation of a dissemination strategy.<T3>Products</T3>_The products to be completed in this stage are: 1. Assessmentplan specifying each step of the assessment process in detail;2. Draft report that includes:<ITAG tagnum="15">_Literature review</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Criteria for identifying promising programs</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Recommendations for refining the goals and objectives of the program</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">_Descriptions of promising/effective programs</ITAG>3. Final report;4. Recommendations for developing program operation manuals; and,5. Dissemination strategy to inform the field of the development of theprogram, and the products and results of this stage.<ITAG tagnum="81">Stage 2_Development of Descriptive Program Operation Manuals</ITAG>Upon successful completion of Stage 1, and with the approval of OJJDP,the recipient will develop two descriptive program operation manuals: A<T3>community action guide</T3> containing community organization and planningstrategies; and, a <T3>program guide</T3> containing programs, policies and procedures forresponding to missing and exploited children.The activities and products of this stage will be based on the informationgenerated as a result of the assessment. Appropriate technical and subjectmatter expertise will be utilized to design the operation manuals whichdetail the promising programs and strategies.Both of the operation manuals will provide guidance as appropriate regarding:Identification and participation of the necessary community public andprivate organizations and decision makers; funding; program organizationand management; the philosophy and approach of the community organization,planning and development activities; resource development; program assessment,coordination, development implementation and monitoring; and evaluationof program effectiveness. This information will become part of a trainingand technical assistance package for dissemination to the appropriate Stateand local agencies. The recipient will also develop a strategy for demonstratingthe comprehensive community action program.<T3>Activities</T3>_The major activities of this stage are: 1. Preparationof a plan for developing the operation manuals;2. Development of the operation manuals;3. Participation and review by the advisory committee;4. Development of recommendations for a program announcement to selectdemonstration sites;5. Development of a demonstration strategy; and,6. Development and implementation of a dissemination strategy.<T3>Products</T3>_The products to be completed in this stage are: 1. Planfor operation manuals development;2. Draft and final operations manuals design(s);3. Demonstration strategy; and,4. Dissemination strategy to inform the field of the development of theprogram, and the products and results of this stage.<ITAG tagnum="81">Stage 3_Training and Technical Assistance Development Activities</ITAG>Upon successful completion of Stage 2, and with the approval of OJJDP,the recipient will prepare a plan for developing the training and technicalassistance packages. Based on the plan, the recipient will transfer theprogram operation manuals and related materials into a training and technicalassistance package. Comprehensive training manuals that detail the programactivities and planning strategies must be developed to encourage and faciliateimplementation of the promising programs in the final stage of the demonstrationphase.The training manual should be the focal point of the entire training andtechnical assistance package. The major audience will be policy makersand practitioners involved in resource allocation, program developmentand operation related to missing and exploited children programs. The manualshould be designed for presentation in formal training sessions and forindependent use in jurisdictions that do not participate in formal trainingsessions. Therefore, each manual should include a complete descriptionof both the promising programs and planning strategies. The manual shouldalso contain instructions and supplementary materials for trainers to facilitatepresentation, and to assure understanding and successful adaptation andimplementation of the promising programs.The recipient will recruit and prepare the training and technical assistancepersonnel to be involved in this demonstration effort. Following this,the training curricula will be tested by the recipient on a limited basisin at least one test site. It is anticipated that this site will laterserve as a training host site for other sites during the last stage ofthis initiative, the replication stage. The recipient will develop a setof recommendations for use by OJJDP in issuing a program announcement forthe selection of demonstration sites. Further, the recipient will developand implement a dissemination strategy to ensure broad distribution ofthe operations manual and related materials.The recipient will, as part of the demonstration strategy, develop a strategyto conduct a series of seminars or conferences, nationally, to inform thefield about the promising programs.<T3>Activities_</T3>The major activities of this stage are: 1. Preparationof a plan for developing the training and technical assistance package;2. Development of the training and technical assistance materials;3. Recruitment and preparation of the training and technical assistancepersonnel;4. Testing of training curriculum package;5. Participation and review by the advisory committee;6. Development of a dissemination strategy to inform the field of the developmentof the program, and the products and results of this stage.<T3>Products_</T3>The products to be completed during the stage are: 1.Plan for the development of the training and technical assistance package;2.
