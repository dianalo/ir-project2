The Hungarian Democratic Forum made the nomination at athree-day congress that opened Friday as parliament ended alandmark session in which it adopted laws to open the way for thefirst multiparty parliamentary elections in more than 40 years.   The elections are to be held next year but the presidentialballoting is to be held by the end of the year; no date has beenset. Subsequent presidents are to be appointed by the newparliament.   The ruling Socialist Party is backing Imre Pozsgay, a popularreformer, as its presidential candidate.   The parliament created the presidency in constitutionalamendments adopted at its last session.   After his nomination Sunday, Fuer acknowledged that Pozsgay hadbuilt up ``a media advantage,'' but he said he believed he stillhad a ``good chance of winning.''   The Democratic Forum claims 20,000 members.   In his acceptance speech to the 850 delegates, Fuer said: ``Wecan risk anything for democracy and for Hungary, but we cannot riskHungarian democracy for anything.''   Fuer said he was dedicated to ``European Christian values.''   He also praised Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, sayingthat without ``his courage and (reform) initiatives, what ishappening now here could not have taken place.''   The Democratic Forum is one of several prominent oppositiongroups that signed an agreement with the Communist Party to holddirect presidential elections before the end of the year.   The Communist Party dissolved itself two weeks ago to create athe new Socialist Party. That party professes democratic ideals butcontinues to hold power until the multiparty elections.   Delegates to the Democratic Forum's congress also elected JozsefAntall as their new chairman.   Antall told a news conference that former chairman Zoltan Birohad objected to the group nominating its own presidential candidate.   Biro was quoted by the independent daily Mai Nap as saying heconsidered Pozsgay a ``suitable'' presidential candidate.</TEXT></DOC>
