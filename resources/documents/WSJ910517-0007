With all ourpreoccupation with the Persian Gulf, we run the risk ofdeveloping a moral tunnel vision that blinds us to the tragicfate of another people -- the Afghans -- who have sufferedmore than the Kuwaitis and the Kurds combined.   More than 1.5 million Afghans have died trying to liberatetheir country from Moscow's occupation armies, and more than5 million remain exiled in fetid refugee camps in Iran andPakistan. Iraq fired 68 SCUD missiles at Saudi Arabia andIsrael; the Kabul regime has fired over 1,500 SCUDS at Afghanresistance positions over the past two years. Yet despiteevery hardship the Afghans continue to fight.</LP><TEXT>   Unfortunately, since President Gorbachev aligned himselfwith communist hardliners late last year, Moscow has frozenits position on the Afghan issue. On a recent trip to Moscow,I detected not a hint of flexibility. KGB chief VladimirKryuchkov told me that Afghan President Najibullah -- who hasordered atrocities that make Saddam Hussein's almost trivialby comparison -- was &quot;a great patriot.&quot; Mr. Gorbachev'ssecurity adviser Yevgeny Primakov argued that a coalitiongovernment of &quot;national reconciliation&quot; under Najibullah'sleadership should form the basis of a settlement.   Moscow is clearly betting that the U.S. will lose interestand that the Kremlin will win by default. To make that alosing bet, the Bush administration and Congress must agreeon a coherent military and political strategy to achieve thegoal of national self-determination for Afghanistan.   Three recent trends create new opportunities on which wecan capitalize:   First, Pakistani leaders are realizing the futility oftrying to control a postwar Afghanistan. For years,Inter-Services Intelligence, Pakistan's CIA, starvedmainstream resistance groups and provided a disproportionateamount of money and arms to the leader of one fundamentalistAfghan party, Hekmatyar Gulbiddin, in a gambit to put himinto power. While necessity forced Afghans to fight under theleadership of anyone who had sufficient supplies during theSoviet occupation, the ISI's bias has badly undercut theresistance effort since Moscow's withdrawal in 1989, becauserank-and-file forces refused to fight on behalf of Pakistan'sclient. In recent months, Pakistani officials have madepromising statements indicating that they are backing awayfrom that failed strategy.   Second, resistance forces are beginning to master the artof conventional warfare. The resistance operated inbattalion-size units and fielded more than 50 artillerypieces and 25 tanks in this month's successful assault on thekey eastern town of Khowst, which was defended by 10,000government troops deployed in multiple defensive rings andsupported by tanks, artillery and air cover. Combining adroitmilitary maneuvers and carefully prepared enemy defections,the attack prevailed in two weeks. Coming on the heels ofvictories at other provincial and district capitals,resistance forces have strong momentum as they enter thefighting season this summer.   Third, the resistance is beginning to unify politically.The membership of the National Commanders' Shura, anindigenous council of Afghan field commanders, started at 40in May 1990, rose to 300 in June 1990, and will likely exceed500 at its next meeting. In addition, Shura commanders havecoordinated their activities with tribal leaders and networksthroughout the country. As the Soviet military newspaper RedStar noted, the main reason for the fall of Khowst was that&quot;on this occasion the rebels were acting together as theyhave never done before, in accordance with a single plan.&quot;   To capitalize on these trends, the U.S. should take threesteps to increase military pressure in the field whilecreating diplomatic incentives for Moscow diplomatically toaccept a just political settlement:                                                                                                          -- Continue aid to the resistance. The administration mustresist the temptation to toss in a deal on the Afghan issueas a sweetener at the next U.S.-Soviet summit, and Congressmust demonstrate firm bipartisan support for a justresolution of the issue. If Congress backs off, the Sovietswill dig in.                                                                                                          -- At the same time, we must insist that Pakistan cut offall assistance to Hekmatyar Gulbiddin. The Gulbiddin forceshave regularly attacked other resistance units. He himselfeven backed Saddam Hussein in the Persian Gulf war. Instead,supplies for moderate groups and the National Commanders'Shura must be increased, and Islamabad must cease its effortsto control Afghanistan's political future.                                                                                                          -- Propose a transition regime and elections. The U.S.should press for a political settlement that replaces theNajibullah government with a transition regime, possiblyheaded by the former king, composed of Afghans who remainedneutral in the war. With full powers over security andmilitary forces, the transitional government would overseethe termination of outside arms supplies and conductelections or a traditional national assembly to determine thecountry's future government. Since Moscow has an interest instability in Afghanistan, we must drive home the point thatno stability is possible unless the Afghans are allowed tochoose their own leaders.                                                                                                          -- Link economic help to the Soviets to the Afghan issue.Since Moscow spent about $3.5 billion on military assistancefor and $700 million on economic aid to the Kabul regime lastyear, sending aid to Moscow subverts our own interests. Weshould link the provision of any technical assistance, loansand credits, or other forms of aid to a just resolution ofthe Afghan conflict. Given the official projection of a 15%drop in Soviet GNP this year, Mr. Gorbachev will have strongincentive to come to the bargaining table.   After 12 years of war, national self-determination iswithin the Afghans' grasp. Unlike the Kuwaitis or the Kurds,the Afghans seek no direct U.S. military involvement. And ifthe U.S. stands firm and adopts the right strategy, we canprevail sooner than many might think.   ---   Sen. Hatch (R., Utah) is a member of the Foreign RelationsCommittee.</TEXT></DOC>
