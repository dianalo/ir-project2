Stevens (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FREST JAPAN EUROP CANDA </CO><IN> MON FRX PCS CMD </IN><TEXT>   The Federal Reserve and seven other major central banks intervened in foreign exchange dealings to halt a plunging dollar after Thursday's U.S. merchandise trade report stunned the markets.    Despite the efforts of the central banks, the dollar still fell 2.3% to stand at 123.60 yen in late New York trading, and dropped nearly as sharply to 1.6620 West German marks.    The dollar fell 2.10 yen in the first 40 minutes of trading in Tokyo Friday. At midday, the unit was down 2.17 yen at 123.98 yen, compared with 126.15 yen at the close Thursday. Commercial bank traders reported that there was fairly large intervention by the Bank of Japan. The central bank and the finance ministry declined comment.    Although the intervention may have succeeded in averting a worse beating for the dollar yesterday, many market participants saw the beginnings of a new lower trend for the dollar.    &quot;The mood is going to be to sell dollars, no question,&quot; said Robert K. Ryan, vice president of foreign exchange at Irving Trust Co., New York. The dollar, he said, is &quot;definitely heading lower.&quot;    The dollar sell-off was triggered by news that the trade deficit widened to $13.83 billion in February from $12.44 billion in January. The report by the Commerce Department was widely expected to show a narrowing of the deficit to around $11 billion, in line with the recent trend in the monthly trade data.    &quot;The number caught the whole market by surprise,&quot; said Carmine J. Rotondo, vice president of foreign exchange at Security Pacific National Bank, New York.    On Wednesday the dollar was quoted at 126.48 yen and 1.6938 marks after picking up strength over most of the past week in anticipation of an improvement in the U.S. trade balance.    Most of the dollar's drop yesterday came within seconds of the trade report and reflected the sudden reversal of market positioning by currency dealers who were expecting a better trade figure. &quot;I got scuffed up pretty bad,&quot; said a dealer at a major New York bank who built up a dollar position ahead of the trade report, expecting the news to send the U.S. currency higher.    During a lull in trading, Fuji Bank Ltd.'s London office half-jokingly offered to sell dollars at any price on its page of the computerized dealing screen linking trading rooms around the world in what makes up the interbank foreign exchange market. &quot;People want to sell any dollars they have,&quot; a Fuji trader said.    Traders agree that the dollar's losses would've been much greater had central banks not intervened. &quot;The markets were ready to sprint toward 1.61 (marks), but they (the central banks) were able to hold&quot; the dollar up, said Mr. Ryan at Irving Trust.    Several traders in New York said the Fed repeatedly bought dollars from them in $10 million transactions, selling marks and yen. Dealers estimated that the Fed purchased $200 million during New York trading. Dealers estimated that foreign central banks may have bought between $400 million and $500 million more using their own currencies in their local markets.    Deutsche Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl, in Washington yesterday for scheduled meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, confirmed that the West German central bank intervened to support the dollar along with other major central banks. The Bank of France and Swiss National Bank also confirmed selling their currencies to buy dollars Thursday. Traders said the central banks of Britain, Italy, Canada and the Netherlands intervened as well, although these actions weren't confirmed.    Traders said their pessimism for the dollar reflects what they perceive as limited options available to monetary authorities to support the currency, especially in light of yesterday's plunge in stock prices. &quot;They can't hike up interest rates because they've got to help the stock market,&quot; said Mr. Rotondo at Security Pacific. Higher interest rates would enhance the appeal of holding dollars but would also undercut stock market stability.    &quot;I don't see anything out there near term or medium term that can turn the dollar around,&quot; Mr. Rotondo said.    But some traders said the dollar could bounce back from yesterday's sell-off. &quot;Is the trade figure really so terrible or just terrible in light of what we were expecting?&quot; asked Hanked Weiland, vice president of foreign exchange at National Westminster Bank USA, New York.    Monetary authorities sought to play down the trade report and the dollar's reaction to the news. U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker said the trade figures &quot;are by their nature erratic&quot; and should be seen in that context.    Mr. Poehl, the West German central bank chief, also told reporters that &quot;one should not overestimate the relevance of the monthly trade figure.&quot; Mr. Poehl also pooh-poohed the dollar's drop. &quot;It moved three pfennigs! My goodness, that's a normal movement,&quot; he said.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $7 an ounce to $454 in brisk trading. The estimated volume was four million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $453.20 an ounce in early trading Friday in Hong Kong.    ---   Terence Roth and Walter S.
