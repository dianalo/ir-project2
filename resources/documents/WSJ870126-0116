The closings of First National Bank of Marlborough, Marlborough, Mass., and First Sierra Bank, Bishop, Calif., bring to 11 the number of bank failures this year, the FDIC said.    Deposits of the Marlborough bank were transferred to Worcester County Institution for Savings, Worcester, Mass., and the failed bank's two branches reopened Saturday as offices of the Worcester bank. The failed bank's main office is due to reopen today, also as a Worcester County branch office.    First National of Marlborough, which was declared insolvent by the Comptroller of the Currency on Friday, had total assets of $55.6 million and held deposits of $47.2 million in 13,000 accounts. Worcester County paid a purchase premium of $7.7 million and agreed to purchase other assets for approximately $12 million.    Marlborough's deposits included approximately $1.5 million in 24 accounts that exceeded the FDIC's insurance limit. Uninsured depositors and other creditors will share proportionately with the FDIC in proceeds from liquidation of the bank's other assets, the FDIC said.    First Sierra was ordered closed Friday by California Superintendent of Banks Louis Carter. The bank's insured deposits were transferred to Security Pacific National Bank, Los Angeles, which will close First Sierra's two offices and service the accounts through existing Security Pacific branches in Bishop and Mammoth Lakes, Calif.    First Sierra had total assets of $23.3 million, with deposits of about $23 million in 4,400 accounts. Security Pacific will pay a nominal premium for the bank, estimated at about $1,000 the FDIC said, and the purchase of other assets is still being negotiated.    First Sierra's deposits included approximately $673,000 in 19 accounts that exceeded the federal insurance limit of $100,000. Uninsured depositors will share proportionately with the FDIC in proceeds from the sale of other assets. However, based on the estimated present value of assets to be liquidated, FDIC directors agreed to a cash advance for uninsured depositors of as much as 55% of the uninsured claim.    The failures were the first for both Massachusetts and California this year. </TEXT></DOC>
