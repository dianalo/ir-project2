But they said it is premature to conclude that recently negotiated controls on ozone-eroding chemicals need to be tightened.    In a news conference, government and industry scientists said an ambitious program of air sampling over Antarctica since mid-August has provided new support for the theory that man-made chemicals are contributing to the region's sharp, seasonal drop in high-altitude ozone.    But they said that weather also is a factor, and that the mechanism causing the region's ozone drop needs to be better understood before scientists can conclude whether it could foreshadow a global acceleration of ozone loss.    The research was sparked by concern for ozone levels about 10 to 25 miles above the earth, which shield the planet from cancer-causing ultraviolet rays.    Spokesmen for some environmental groups had speculated that the Antarctica study might show an urgent need to tighten the international protocol developed at last month's meeting on the ozone problem in Montreal. United Nations officials had expressed willingness to call a new, emergency meeting if scientists found ozone depletion accelerating. In the absence of an emergency, the protocol isn't due to be reviewed until 1990.    The agreement, which 24 nations signed Sept. 16, calls for a 50% reduction in chlorofluorocarbons and a freeze on halons by the mid-1990s. It hasn't yet been ratified.    Yesterday's unusual preliminary research report came from scientists for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the National Science Foundation and the Chemical Manufacturers Association. They have been using ground stations and aircraft to conduct the most detailed study ever performed of Antarctic air chemistry.    The most striking sign of ozone depletion comes in the atmosphere over Antarctica between August and October. This year, the scientists said, ozone readings over Antarctica dropped 50%, to 15% below the lowest level recorded since the ozone &quot;hole&quot; was first detected in 1979. Ozone problems are greatest in Antarctica because its air is colder than in the rest of the globe and it is more isolated from other weather patterns.    Robert Watson, a NASA project scientist, said the sampling disproved theories that the Antarctic ozone &quot;hole&quot; is caused by solar radiation or an upward surge of air from near the surface. While unique Antarctic weather patterns play a role in creating the &quot;hole,&quot; he said, more research is needed to determine the relative importance of chemicals and whether they promote ozone depletion at other locations.    Rafe Pomerance, an analyst for the World Resources Institute, an environmental think tank in Washington, said the study's results would increase pressure on nations to cut chlorofluorocarbon production, ratify the Montreal protocol and support research.    Kevin Fay, executive director of the Alliance for Responsible Chlorofluorocarbon Policy, which represents producers of the chemicals, said the findings buttress his group's support for the protocol. </TEXT></DOC>
