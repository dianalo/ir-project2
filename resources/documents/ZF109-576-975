 Now, two products make iteasy to do just that--dBx and Codebase.andM;Coupled with a C compiler, dBx will take any standard xBASE program andcompile the code into a C EXE file.andP;  This is a versatile program that workswith many xBASE dialects (dBASE III PLUS, FoxBASE+, Clipper, dBMan, anddBXL).andP;  Once the code has been translated, you can add even morefunctionality by using your C libraries of choice.andM;One such library is Codebase, which can provide full xBASE functionality forany C application, even those created by dBx.andP;  Now that C is wo widely used,Codebase can given programmers the ability to access xBASE records from avariety of computers and operating systems.andM;Porting xBASE code to alternate operating systems is just one of thehighlights offered by both dBx 4.7 and Codebase 4.2.andP;  While portability is aprimary benefit, there are other reasons to use them.andP;  Anyone who's worked inxBASE knows that many of the functions either operate at a snail's pace oraren't possible.andP;  dBx and Codebase can increase the speed of specific programmodules as well as create new ones.andP;  Modules that deal with hardwarecommunications, for example, could be removed from an xBASE program andtranslated and beefed up using C statements and functions.andP;  This programsegment could then be linked with the original code using an xBASE compilerand linker.andM;dBs is a very capable, slick program translator, but the manual thataccompanies it is a disappointment.andP;  The docs have a poor print job anduser-unfriendly text.andP;  The examples were elementary and provided little or nodirection in translating my first application.andM;Installing the C compiler is the first step in getting started with dBx.andP;  dBsin its standard version supports Microsoft C, Turbo C, and Quick C withspecial configurations possible for non-standard compilers.andP;  dBx comes withan automatic install process and set-up program.andP;  Installation isn'tcomplicated as long as you follow the instructions.andP;  In fact, it wasrelatively simple compared to their 4.0 version, which had differenttranslator disks for different compilers.andP;  One area, however, requires closeadherence to the instructions.andP;  The first statement in the path must point tothe subdirectory the compiler is in.andP;  Be alerted: failure to do so will causea problem compiling C source code.andM;During the installation process, dBs creates a tutor sub-directory, whichsimultaneously familiarizes you with the system and tests your set-up toverify that the system is working correctly.andM;dBx begins its translation by constructing a variable dictionary, based onthe variables in your xBASE source, along with details on type and use.andO;You're required to create the next translation file, labeled the DataBaseDefinition file (DBD).andP;  This file is a collection of xBASE-like statements,which provide data concerning variable types as well as database and indexesused.andP;  Actually, if you get the DBD file created correctly, everything elsefalls into place.andP;  During the first phase of translation, the system willcreate an SRC file (raw database description) to help create the DBD file.andO;dBx will process your xBASE program file using the variable dictionary anduse the DBD file to create the C source files.andP;  If dBx finds no conflicts orerrors, it'll compile and link (with the help of your compiler) the sourceinto an EXE.andP;  If errors do occur, the system will generate a series of ERRfiles, indicating where the errors occurred.andP;  If you aren't familiar with C,the generated C source files contain the original xBASE commands as comments.andM;Codebase, on the other hand, is a support program and not a programtranslator like dBx.andP;  It works as a library and provides xBASE functionalityto C applications, whether the program was originally written in C ortranslated by dBx.andM;Codebase doesn't require any real installation other than copying files.andO;There was one small hassle I had to get around.andP;  I was using Turbo C, notTurbo C++, which meant I had to run through a special library regeneration,but that was easy.andP;  One of the nice things about Codebase is that they giveyou all of their source code, helpful if you want to alter a function.andM;The manual was easy to follow and provided excellent examples for everyfunction.andP;  It consistently shows how easy it to use.andP;  They even offer sampleprograms and readme files on the disks.andP;  Each of the functions were easy touse and remember, because the naming conventions are similar to xBASE.andM;Codebase not only provides xBASE record and index access, it actually givesyou the ability to create a wide range of screen and menuing routines.andP;  Forexample, BROWSE and QUICK BROWSE are two functions that not only scan forrecords, but also provide APPEND and EDIT functionality in an attractivewindowing format.andP;  This can lead to a clearer image, giving users theillusion that you put in many hours of work.andP;  The windowing features permityou to REINDEX, CREATE, and ZAP a database.andP;  With Codebase, anything you cando in xBASE, you can do in C.andM;Codebase supports Turbo C, Turbo C++, Watcomm C, Microsoft C, Quick C andZortech C++.andM;dBx 4.7 (listed at $600) and Codebase 4.2 (listed at $295) can provide anydeveloper with an excellent environment to create professional, portablesoftware.andP;  While these programs lend flexibility and an optimum environmentfor software development, they aren't for &quot;Sunday drivers&quot; or &quot;armchairprogrammers.&quot;andP;  They're designed for serious use.andP;  They make every minutecount, which is really important when you're cranking out code with adeadline.andP;  The bottom line is that dBx 4.7 and Codebase 4.2 jump-start anotherwise sluggish process.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
