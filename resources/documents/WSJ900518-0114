Mr.Chatfield never gave the &quot;off-the-record&quot; approval attributedto him, and your reporter committed journalistic malpracticeby making no effort to verify that statement (or even verifythe identity of the person who said it).</LP><TEXT>   Summit Cement, whose waste is both &quot;toxic&quot; and&quot;hazardous,&quot; chose to build a plant in the Bahamas to escapethe community opposition that has become commonplace in theU.S. due to the poor track record of waste handlers. SummitCement's stated goal, according to papers filed with both theEPA and the Bahamian government, was to import up to 88,000tons of waste from the U.S.   The project was not killed by &quot;environmentalistroadblocks,&quot; but by the Bahamian government's denial ofpermission to import the waste. For his flacking for such anill-advised project, Kenny Rogers deserves his spot in theEnvironmental Hall of Shame. Your editorial page rates aneven higher ranking.
