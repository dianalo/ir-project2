Deferring salary, bonus, or commissions to benefit from 1987's lower tax rates is a good bet for many. But consider the drawbacks first, says Elaine Church of Price Waterhouse, CPAs: To avoid &quot;constructive receipt,&quot; or unrestricted right to the pay, you generally must elect to defer it irrevocably before doing services that earn it; you must be able to show that you weren't entitled to the money until 1987.    Some employers offer loans to employees until delayed income is paid, but the IRS is unlikely to accept that as true pay deferral. Other pitfalls: Deferring pay may reduce 1986 profit-sharing and pension contributions and life and disability insurance based on pay; it may trim &quot;golden-parachute&quot; protection based on pay for employees who later lose their jobs. Employers lose 1986 pay deductions if they don't pay deferred income by next March 15.    Many people pushing 1986 pay into 1987 will defer equal sums of 1987 pay to 1988, when rates are to fall again, says Richard Stanger of Price.    IRS AUDITORS should begin interviews by making taxpayers &quot;comfortable.&quot;    So says a new IRS directive; it follows return preparers' complaints that increased emphasis on interviews threatens clients. The IRS says talks often are needed because only the taxpayer has information on income and expenses. &quot;Remember, the taxpayer is being examined and not just the return,&quot; the IRS manual says. But the preparer isn't precluded from being present.    The initial interview is the most important part of an audit, the IRS says; auditors should start by making taxpayers comfortable, explaining obligations and rights, and inviting questions. Auditors must learn enough to make judgments about employment, finances, living standards, exempt income, property, asset transfers, dependents, and &quot;the potential for moonlighting,&quot; among other things, the manual says.    A LITTLE LEARNING doesn't go far enough to pass the IRS's exemption test.    An educational organization may advocate views and yet be exempt under IRS rules if it offers &quot;full and fair&quot; facts to allow &quot;independent&quot; conclusions -- but not if it emphasizes &quot;unsupported opinion.&quot; In 1980, the District of Columbia federal appeals court found the IRS rules &quot;unconstitutionally vague&quot; and reversed the IRS's denial of exemption to Big Mama Rag, a feminist magazine. But in 1983, the same court upheld a denial of exemption to the National Alliance, an advocate of white supremacy.    Now Revenue Procedure 86-43 lists IRS criteria for deciding if an advocacy group's &quot;methodology&quot; disqualifies it from exemption: A method fails if it lacks a factual foundation or a development from facts &quot;that would materially aid . . . in a learning process.&quot; The IRS looks for &quot;significant&quot; use of factually unsupported views, distorted facts, &quot;substantial use of inflammatory and disparaging terms,&quot; and conclusions based more on &quot;strong emotional feelings&quot; than on &quot;objective evaluations.&quot;    But in &quot;exceptional&quot; cases, advocacy may be exempt education even if such factors are present.    INTEREST on underpayments caused by retroactive law starts running right after a fiscal-year concern's 1986 return was due, IRS official Peter Scott insists; &quot;we would strongly resist&quot; claims that interest can't begin before the tax act became law Oct. 22, he says. That claim was made last week by Roy Harrill of Arthur Andersen andamp; Co.    SMALL-BUSINESS corporations that once lost &quot;S&quot; status may re-elect now to be S corporations (taxed like partnerships). IRS Revenue Ruling 86-141 waives the required five-year waiting period for re-elections that are filed by Dec. 31, notes Ted Stone of Ernst andamp; Whinney, CPAs.    REQUIRED PAYOUTS from pension plans and individual retirement accounts for 1985 and 1986 needn't be made until Dec. 31, 1987, IRS Notice 86-14 says, because guidelines still aren't ready. The IRS previously delayed the deadline for minimum 1985 distributions until Dec. 31, 1986.    THE IRS MUST REFINE its planning for new computers, the GAO advises.    In two reports to the House Ways and Means oversight panel, the General Accounting Office appraises IRS plans to replace its data-retrieval processors in 1987 and to revamp its main systems by 1992. Mindful of the return-processing fiasco of 1985 that followed the IRS's latest computer overhaul, the GAO advises the IRS to develop and analyze workload data and monitor computer performance to make more reliable forecasts of its computer needs.    If future workloads materialize as expected and if the IRS achieves plans to extend the life of its newest systems, those computers needn't be replaced before 1991, the GAO says; but if the IRS miscalculates, it could have some capacity problems by mid-1988. The GAO also notes that programming delays have set back installations of data-retrieval processors by a few months; it advises the IRS to set up specific contingency plans in case of major problems.    The GAO is concerned about IRS plans to install the data-retrieval units during the 1987 filing season.    BRIEFS: Democrats Riegle of Michigan, Rockefeller of West Virginia, and Daschle of South Dakota (a freshman) are expected to join the Senate Finance Committee; Republicans Grassley of Iowa and Symms of Idaho are expected to be dropped. . . . The District of Columbia says it would gain $10 million from a three-month tax amnesty proposed for 1987. </TEXT></DOC>
