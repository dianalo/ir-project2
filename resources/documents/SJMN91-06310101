I'm 27 years old and have awife and two daughters. I'm currently unemployed and my wife's job as anurse's aide is our only source of income. Needless to say, we're on a verytight budget.;   My problem concerns eczema, a skin disease that makes yourhands and feet very dry and red. Without medication, my hands develop opensores, which are painful. My scratching them makes the eczema spread. Since weare on such a tight budget, I can't afford to go to a doctor for aprescription. My wife has insurance through her work but only for herself andthe kids. I'm asking you to please step in and help get me some medicalattention for my problem.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LIFE TAKES ON A BETTER COMPLEXION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Ross is a Minneapolis millionaire known internationally for his philanthropicactivities.  </MEMO><TEXT>     -- Itching in misery. Fenton, Mo.;   DEAR MISERABLE -- I've heard thatstress makes eczema worse. I can only imagine that being unemployed andwithout medical insurance has got you ready to crawl out of your skin. Allowme to help you get a grip, by accepting my check, which should cover severaldoctor visits and medication. I have no long-term solutions, but thistemporary fix should get you pointed in the right direction.;   DEAR MR. ROSS-- I'm a 67-year-old retired woman who is recovering from Crohn's disease.Prior to this illness, I was quite active, enjoying retirement within thelimits of my Social Security income. Now, with the aid of a walking cane, I'mable to take several walks a day around the apartment complex where I live.Otherwise, I'm quite limited in my activities. With the loss of mobility, Iseem to have also lost quite a few friends. I'm desperately lonely.;   Smallpets are allowed by the management here. I can get a dog, free of charge,through the local Humane Society and the Purina Pets for Seniors Program.Although my funds will allow for pet food, I haven't been able to budget forthe $250 pet deposit required by management. I'm so lonely for something tolove me. Could you see your way clear to making a lonely woman very happyagain?;   -- Mrs. G. B. Tacoma, Wash.;   DEAR MRS. B. -- I'm happy to obligeyour request. Everyone needs to feel loved and give love in return. It's asessential as food and shelter, if you're interested in a quality of lifebeyond survival.;   And, contrary to the recent blunder my editor made whenshe sent a handsome check so someone could purchase a dog, yes, you can getdogs for a minimal fee through the Humane Society. In doing so, you're alsosaving a life. As for you, Mrs. B., make arrangements for your new roommate.My $250 pet deposit is on the way.;   DEAR PERCY ROSS -- Thank you for thelimo ride and the pizza party at Chuck E. Cheese. The limo driver, Howard, heis a great guy. He let me sit up front with him. We went to pick up my friendsthat have muscular dystrophy, like me, and take them to my birthday party.They never had a limo ride before, either. When we got to Chuck E. Cheese, wehad our pizza and cake and I shook Chuck E. Cheese's hand and played somegames. I got a lot of neat presents -- mostly turtle stuff and a radio. Thiswas my best birthday ever, thanks to you, Percy. You're a great guy.;   --Richard, Flint, Mich.;   DEAR READERS -- Remember the soon to turn 10-year-oldboy who had tons of moxie when it came to dealing with his muscular dystrophy?As you can see, Ricky had his dream come true. According to his mom, Howardthe limousine driver was one heck of a guy. He not only discounted theirlimousine rate, he also gave them extra time.;   You may remember Ricky's goalwas to become a limousine driver one day. After meeting Howard, he changed hismind. Now he'd like to own the limo company and have Howard work for him.Ricky, you're a lot like ol' Percy!  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Thanks a Million column; Percy Ross column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911105  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  November  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  691  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday, November 5, 199100310101,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
