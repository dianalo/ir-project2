 Acquisition strategy meetings can airand resolve problems early, avoiding delays later.andP;  Obtaining a commitment tomajor milestones from those involved is the best way to keep on schedule.andM;The book also advises that you limit the number of pages on bothsolicitations and proposals.andP;  The contracting portion of a solicition shouldnot exceed 150 pages.andP;  The technical portion should not exceed 200 pages.andM;Firm limits should be set for the number of pages in a proposal, with allpages in excess of the limit returned to the offerer and not considered inthe evaluation.andP;  Proposals should not exceed 500 pages, not including thecost porposal.andM;The agency should keep source selection official authority at the lowestreasonable level, according to the handbook.andP;  A shorter chain of command willexpedite communications with the source selection officer and will enhancethe decision-making process.andM;Using solicitation review board meetings to exedite the review and approvalprocess is another suggestion.andP;  In such a meeting all who have review andapproval responsibilities air their concerns.andP;  Meetings also can be used toplan the procurement and develop positions before negotiations begin.andM;NASA recommends using oral briefings by offerers to the source evaluationboard.andP;  The briefings would allow the source selection board to understandthe proposals.andM;The briefings should not be considered a discussion and should not be used aspart of the scoring process.andP;  The format, ground rules and time period shouldbe uniform for all briefings and should include time for questions andanswers.andM;Encourage MembershipandM;A major recommendation is that officials enhhance and reward membership onsource selection boards.andP;  Membership on a source selection board generally isconsidered detrimental to career advancement.andM;According to the handbook, such service will be encouraged by considering itin performance appraisals, by redistributing workloads, by making a yearlyspecial award for outstanding performance on a source evaluation board, andby a monetary award for extraordinary performance.andP;  All vacancy announcementsat GS/GM-15 level and above will consider source evaluation board experienceas an evaluation factor in the selection of candidates.andM;Other key procedures recommended in the handbook include requesting onlynecessary information, liminting evaluation subfactors and limiting the sizeof source evaluation boards.andP;  The combination of smaller requests forproposals, smaller proposals, fewer evaluation factors, and smaller supportcommittees and panels should make source selection faster and morecost-effective.andM;The handbook also recommends limiting field pricig and audit support toinformation specialty required, using &quot;subject to approval&quot; designations ondocuments that need to be worked on at lower levels while awaiting higherlevel approval, limiting consensus reviews at headquarters, and expanding theuse of NASA research announcements to obtain proposals and make multipleawards.andM;Other procedures include re-examining and revalidating delegations ofapproval, standardizing presentation formats to source evaluation boards,using the Program Approval Document to ensure agencywide agreement on majorprograms and providing formal training to members of source evaluationboards.andM;Frequently, I am asked question about late bids, Earlier this year, theGeneral Accounting Office ruled that a late bid was acceptable because ofgovernment mishandling, because the location of the bid box was statedincorrectly in the solicitation.andP;  Also, a government secretary delayed itsdelivery when the messenger was told incorrectly that the bid needed anenvelope.andM;See United Teleplex, GAO Comptroller General Decision B-237160.2, Feb. 2,1990.andM;The Federal Register of May 25, 1990, contains the final rule on theDrug-Free Workplace Act of 1988 (P.L.andP;  100-690).andP;  This statute requiresfederal contractors and gratees to certify that they will provide drug-freeworkplaces.andM;The certification is a precondition for receiving contracts or grants from afederal agency.andP;  This new rule, effective last week, amends the earlierinterim rule published in Federal Acquisition Circular 84-43.andM;In general, the differences between the interim rule and the final ruleappear to be more extensive for grant recipients than for contractors.andO;Breifly, contractors must certify that they will maintain a drug-freeworkplace through the following procedures:andM;* Prepare and post a policy statement notifying employees that drug abuse inthe workplace is strictly prohibited.andM;* Require that each employee directly involved in the performance of afederal government contract notify his employer of any criminal drugconviction for a violation occurring in the workplace.andM;* Require that the contractor notify the appropriate government office ofsuch a conviction.andM;* Maintain an employee drug-free awarenees program.andM;* Impose sanctions or take other remedial measures for any employee convictedof drug violations in the workplace.andM;William N. Hunter, Ph.D., is a 10-year veteran of the Office of Managementand Budget, where he was director of the Federal Acquisition Institute.andP;  Heis founder of W N Hunter andamp; Associates, a Vienna, Va., management consultingfirm specializing in federal procurement policy.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
