The Producer Price Index rose a moderate 0.4 percent in April,down from a 0.6 percent advance in March, the Labor Department saidFriday.   Analysts noted that if the volatile energy and food sectors wereremoved, the April price advance was a minuscule 0.1 percent.   ``It is hard to make a real scare story that inflation is takingoff based on these kinds of numbers,'' said David Wyss, aneconomist with Data Resources Inc.   For the first four months of the year, wholesale prices haverisen at an annual rate of 2.9 percent, not much changed from the2.2 percent increase for all of 1987.   The report sparked a rally in the bond markets as investorsconcluded there will be no additional pressure on the FederalReserve to drive interest rates higher to dampen demand.   Prices of long-term government bonds rose as much as $5 for each$1,000 in face value to yield 9.17 percent. On Thursday thebellwether 30-year issue's yield jumped to its highest point thisyear at 9.22 percent.   Other economists, however, insisted that the April price reportcontained some troubling signs that price increases will beaccelerating in the months ahead.   ``It would be a mistake to look at this report and sayinflationary pressures have abated,'' said Michael Evans, head of aWashington forecasting firm. ``I don't think this relief is goingto last.''   Energy prices, which had posted sharp declines from Septemberthrough February, accounted for half of the increase in the overallindex in April, rising 3.1 percent.   Gasoline costs advanced 0.7 percent, while home heating oil shotup 5.2 percent. Natural gas, which had declined in price in five ofthe last six months, rose 4.3 percent.   Food costs rose 0.4 percent in April as a sharp 16.3 percentdrop in the price of eggs and smaller declines in the price offruit, fish and beef offset price increases for pork, chicken,vegetables and coffee.   The financial markets took the economic news in stride. On WallStreet, the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 22.55 points toclose at 1,990.55.   Brokers noted that there were no unpleasant surprises in theproducer price index and instead drew inspiration from fallinginterest rates and a steady dollar.   In another economic report Friday, the government said totalbusiness sales surged 1.9 percent in March, the biggest advance inmore than a year, while business inventories were up a modest 0.3percent.   Analysts said the combination of rising sales and small declinesin inventories should translate into continued strong industrialproduction in the months ahead.</TEXT></DOC>
