Speaking here during a four-city U.S. tour, the AfricanNational Congress president invited U.S. investors to startscouting out opportunities in South Africa now. But he askedthem to hold onto their checkbooks until an interimgovernment takes over, which he hinted he would like to seeas early as February.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;I am here to say yes to American trade and investment assoon as that interim government is in place, even beforethere are free elections,&quot; Mr. Mandela said. Previously, hehad said foreign dollars wouldn't be welcome until blacks,who make up almost 75% of the population, get the right tovote.   But Mr. Mandela's invitation is unlikely to spur astampede back to South Africa, whose crippled economy is rifewith violent strikes and fears that private businesses willbe nationalized once the ANC gains a role in the interimgovernment. &quot;Contrary to what you may have heard or read,&quot;Mr. Mandela insisted, &quot;the ANC is not an enemy of privateenterprise or the market system.&quot;   He said private businesses will lead the new economy,while the interim government will decide which industries toput under government control. That government probably won'tinclude top leaders of the ANC, Mr. Mandela said in aninterview.   South African leaders are scheduled to meet in March tohammer out the country's new economic policy and addressissues including the unequal distribution of wealth andeducation.   Before his speech Friday, Mr. Mandela met with executivesfrom USX Corp., PPG Industries Inc., Aluminum Co. of Americaand H.J. Heinz Co., which sponsored his visit here. &quot;Theyshowed a great deal of interest&quot; in investing in SouthAfrica, he said.   Heinz Chairman J.F. O'Reilly confirmed that his interestin South African investments is &quot;high.&quot; Heinz's investmentsin Zimbabwe and Botswana are &quot;exceptionally successful,&quot; hesaid. &quot;That encourages us to go to an even more sophisticatedmarket like South Africa.&quot;   But others have cold feet. Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co.,which sold its South African operations in 1989, has &quot;noplans, regardless of {Mr.} Mandela's statement, to return toSouth Africa,&quot; a spokesman said.</TEXT></DOC>
