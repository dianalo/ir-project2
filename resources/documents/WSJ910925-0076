Helmick after his resignation overconflict-of-interest charges, tapped Mr. Helmick's specialassistant.   The committee's executive committee nominated William J.Hybl, 49 years old, and chairman of the El Pomar Foundation,a philanthropic organization in Colorado Springs, Colo., tosucceed Mr. Helmick, who quit after reports that he receivedconsulting fees from clients involved with the Olympic Games.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Hybl, whose nomination must be approved by the U.S.Olympic Committee's board, said in an interview he hopes topropose &quot;substantial changes in the requirements for{financial} disclosure.&quot; If elected to the interim post, Mr.Hybl would serve the remaining 15 months of Mr. Helmick'sfour-year term.   The controversy surrounding Mr. Helmick has put the U.S.Olympic Committee in the awkward position of defending itsofficials at a time when it is raising donations for the 1992Games. It has appointed a special counsel to investigate Mr.Helmick's dealings as well as charges that its executivedirector, Harvey Schiller, solicited equipment and a $3,000ski pass from U.S. Skiing, the national governing body foramateur skiing, in exchange for increased grants from theU.S. Olympic Committee. Mr. Schiller has denied the chargesby U.S. Skiing.   Mr. Helmick, a 54-year-old lawyer with Dorsey andamp; Whitney inDes Moines, Iowa, had served in the volunteer post of U.S.Olympic Committee president since June 1985. USA Todayreported that he was paid consulting fees of at least$127,000 in 1990 by such clients as Turner BroadcastingSystem Inc., which purchased TV rights to some events. USAToday also said Mr. Helmick was paid at least $150,000 in1990 and 1991 by FINA, the international governing body ofswimming and diving, for consulting to secure TV rightsagreements.   Mr. Helmick has denied any wrongdoing and has severed tieswith the clients in question. &quot;I resigned because of thecontinuing media attention,&quot; which was hurting theorganization, he said. &quot;I've given 30 years of my life tothis. {The resignation} was another thing to give.&quot;   After an ethics review, the 18-voting-member executivecommittee subsequently gave Mr. Helmick a vote of confidence,while also appointing a special counsel to investigatefurther. The International Olympic Committee has alsolaunched its own inquiry into the matter.   Mr. Helmick will continue to serve on the U.S. OlympicCommittee's executive committee and board. He will alsocontinue as one of the two U.S. members of the InternationalOlympic Committee, as well as a member of its executiveboard.   His replacement, Mr. Hybl, a White House counsel in theReagan Administration, said his main focus will be the 1992Olympic Games. The budget for the quadrennium, or four-yearterm, that ends in 1992 is $298 million. &quot;Our athletes arefocused on preparing for the Games,&quot; he said. &quot;It's our jobto see that they can.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
