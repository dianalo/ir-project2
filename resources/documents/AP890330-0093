Milken and two others in the largest criminal actionagainst a Wall Street trader.   The Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. executive was indicted by afederal grand jury Wednesday along with his 40-year-old brother,Lowell J. Milken, and Bruce Lee Newberg, a former trader forDrexel, the nation's fifth-largest securities firm.   The long-expected indictment charged the three with turningDrexel into a billion-dollar racketeering enterprise that usedDrexel's junk bond department for a series of securities fraudswith various unindicted co-conspirators. Among them are theimprisoned Ivan Boesky and members of the defunct investmentpartnership, Princeton-Newport Partners.   All three defendants face up to 20 years in prison on each oftwo racketeering charges, prosecutors said.   Among other things, the indictment accused Milken of usingillegal inside information about merger proposals to arrange dealsand manipulate stocks.   U.S. Attorney Benito Romano said the racketeering penalties werethe most ever sought against individuals under the 19-year-oldfederal Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act.   But defense lawyers attacked the 98-count indictment as an abuseof prosecutorial power and a tool to wrench cooperation from otherDrexel employees.   They called the charges a ``perversion'' of the racketeeringact, which was established principally to combat organized crimebut is used increasingly to prosecute white-collar criminals.   ``I think it is outrageous to use RICO in a circumstance likethis,'' said Michael Armstrong, an attorney for Lowell Milken.``They applied the statute to behavior which for the most part hasnot been considered even to be criminal, much less the subject of aracketeering indictment.''   The three defendants denied wrongdoing and said they would pleadinnocent.   ``After almost 2{ years of leaks and distortions I am now eagerto present all the facts in an open and unbiased forum,'' MichaelMilken said in a statement.   Milken, 42, has headed Drexel's junk bond department since themid-1970s and is credited with revolutionizing corporate takeoversby relying on the highly risky, high yielding securities, turningthem into a $175 billion annual market. The bonds also are oftenused to help small and medium-size companies grow.   The indictment described the Beverly Hills, Calif.-based junkbond department as ``the driving force behind Drexel's business''noting that between 1983 and 1987 it accounted for nearly half ofDrexel's profits.   If convicted on the racketeering counts alone, each defendantwould face maximum fines of $3.7 billion, roughly double theiralleged illicit profits.   In addition, the three are subject to forfeiture proceedings onvirtually all money they have made through their Drexel dealingssince 1984, an estimated $1.85 billion. That includes $1.2 billionin salaries, $112 million in Drexel stock, $205 million incorporate finance fees, $37 million in trading profits on allegedlytainted deals and $257 million in interest.   Michael Milken also was charged with all of the 96non-racketeering counts, which include numerous mail, wire andsecurities frauds. His brother was charged with 11 counts andNewberg with 20 counts.   If convicted of the non-racketeering charges, each would face amaximum penalty of five years in prison and at least $250,000 infines per count, making Michael Milken subject to $24 million infines and a total of 520 years imprisonment.   The indictment paralleled the Securities and ExchangeCommission's sweeping civil insider trading action against Drexel,Milken and others last September.   In December, Drexel struck a plea bargain with prosecutors thatcalled for the dismissal of Milken and the withholding of most ofhis 1988 compensation _ estimated at between $100 million and $200million.   As part of the agreement, which Drexel says it made to avoidcrippling racketeering charges, the firm agreed to plead guilty tosix federal felony charges and pay a record $650 million in finesand penalties.   Drexel has not yet pleaded to the charges and settlement of thecriminal case remained subject to SEC approval.   A Drexel statement said the Milkens had been placed on leave ofabsence.</TEXT></DOC>
