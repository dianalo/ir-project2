BOLT</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A castle door, a silver saddle, seven crystalchandeliers, a bronze Indian statue and other collectibles couldhelp bail out a few failed Texas thrifts.   The items, including 17th Century antiques, a Bacarach crystaleagle, sculptures and artwork, belonged to 16 insolvent savings andloans and will be auctioned by federal regulators Saturday to helppay the thrifts' bills.   Among those is Vernon Savings and Loan Association of Dallas,whose former president is on trial for allegedly using thrift fundsto buy influence.   In all, about 20,000 pieces are expected to bring in about$625,000 for regulators to use in bailing out the industry.   A similar auction in Houston last month netted the FederalSavings and Loan Insurance Corp. $795,000. Two more sales arescheduled, ``and then we'll be out of the furniture business,'' saidJohn Pace, who oversees receiverships in the central regulatorydivision.   While the bulk of the items are office furnishings and bankingequipment, attention has been focused on antiques and unusualpieces, many acquired by Vernon officials on European shoppingsprees.   Vernon, closed by regulators in a $1.3 billion bailout inSeptember 1987, is frequently cited as an example of the worstabuses in the industry, and some of its top executives have pleadedguilty to or face fraud charges.   Pat King, former president of Vernon, is on trial in U.S.District Court on charges he approved using deposits to pay forjunkets for state regulators and thrift officials.   The trial, which began Aug. 7, recessed this week because of thedeath of the father of one of the prosecutors. It is scheduled toresume Monday.   Vernon owner Don Dixon is the target of federal criminalinvestigators and already has been named in a $540 million federalcivil fraud lawsuit.   Some of the antiques for sale during the four-day auction were inDixon's and other Vernon offices, Pace said.   Among the items for sale are:   _Seven 17th Century carved oak chairs.   _A hand-carved castle door with brass bosses and strap work.   _A 47-inch-tall, bronze Indian sitting on a 40-inch-by-40-inchbase.   _Numerous smaller sculptures and statues, including several byFrederic Remington.   _A replica of a bald eagle, made from the feathers ofnon-endangered birds.   _Two rams horns and brass wall sconces.   _A longhorn skull.   _A hand-tooled, custom-made saddle with silver mounted candle,horn, skirt and stirrups and a silver bridle.</TEXT></DOC>
