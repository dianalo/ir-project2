In the year-earlier period, the Menlo Park, Calif., company had a loss of $814,000 on revenue of $6.1 million.    Silvar-Lisco said it will cut expenses and reduce staff &quot;at all levels of the company.&quot; The layoffs would follow the 5% reduction in its work force in February. The company currently has 200 employees and the additional layoffs probably will range from 5% to 10%, a spokesman for the company said.    The company blamed the anticipated loss on a summer slump in its European business, the delay in an expected new product release, and a misreading of its market. </TEXT></DOC>
