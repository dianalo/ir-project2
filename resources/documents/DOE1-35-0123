<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-35-0123 </DOCNO><TEXT>The corrosion of iron and steel in the form of storage tanks, pipelines,pumps, and other systems by sulfate-reducing bacteria is a serious problemfaced by the petroleum industry. These bacteria also cause decreasesin permeability of the fine pores of underground petroleum reservoirs,impeding the secondary recovery of petroleum by water injection. Recently,sulfate-reducing bacteria have been suspected of contributing to failureof certain enhanced (tertiary) oil-recovery operations, possibly by degradingpolymers used in situ as mobility control agents. Thus almost every aspectof oil recovery can be hindered by the ubiquitous sulfate-reducing bacteria.This review updates the earlier ones by presenting more recent informationon the newly discovered strains of sulfate-reducing bacteria, on methodsfor the cultivation of sulfate-reducing bacteria on agar surfaces, onthe bacterial dissimilatory sulfate reduction process, and on novel mechanismsof corrosion by these organisms.</TEXT></DOC>
