The primary source of polarization is due to electron scatteringin the disk's photosphere. It is shown that the degree of polarizationcan be used as a powerful probe of the structure and evolution of thedisk atmosphere. The degree of polarization is considerably higher inthe ultraviolet than at optical wavelengths, and the degree of polarizationmay be higher in an eclipsing system when the central region of the diskis eclipsed. The orbital phase dependence distinguishes intrinsic polarizationfrom the disk to that due to interstellar medium. 29 references.</TEXT></DOC>
