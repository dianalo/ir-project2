Bacterial gases such as landfill gases,marsh gases, and the gases typically found in soils and ground watercan be readily distinguished from pipeline gas or storage gas by carbonisotope analysis of methane. Petroleum related gases from different sourcescan also be differentiated through the use of chemical and isotopic analyses.Therefore, if pipeline gas is being stored in a producing area, geochemicalfingerprinting can be used to distinguish storage gas from native gasand to identify gas that has migrated from the storage reservoir. Insome cases, one can even distinguish old injection gas from recent injectiongas.</TEXT></DOC>
