The committee'sstudy addressed major issues in geothermal energy technology, made recommendationsfor research and development, and considered cooperative arrangementsamong government, industry, and universities to facilitate Randamp;D undercurrent severe budget constraints. The report addresses four types ofgeothermal energy: hydrothermal, geopressured, hot dry rock, and magmasystems. Hydrothermal systems are the only type that are now economicallycompetitive commercially. Further technology development by the Departmentof Energy could make the uneconomical hydrothermal resources commerciallyattractive to the industry. The economics are more uncertain for thelonger-term technologies for extracting energy from geopressured, hotdry rock, and magma systems. For some sites, the cost of energy derivedfrom geopressured and hot dry rock systems is projected within a commerciallycompetitive range. The use of magma energy is too far in the future tomake reasonable economic calculations.</TEXT></DOC>
