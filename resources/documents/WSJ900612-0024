Du Pont, which sold the fiber under the Orlon trade name,said it had been losing money on the business in recent yearsbecause of imports and the loss of customers to polyester andcotton. &quot;Each market, for its own set of reasons, has beenunder attack,&quot; said Paul G. Gillease, director of Du Pont'stextile division.</LP><TEXT>   He said annual sales of Orlon were about $200 million. In1989, total fiber sales by Du Pont, including those of nylon,were $5.97 billion.   Mr. Gillease said Du Pont will withdraw from the acrylicfiber business as soon as possible to concentrate on itsother apparel fabrics, Dacron polyester and Lycra spandex. Hesaid the company will probably be able to offer other jobs toa majority of the 775 people currently employed in the Orlonbusiness. Du Pont makes Orlon along with other fabrics atplants in Camden, S.C., and Waynesboro, Va.   The exit by Du Pont should give a boost to other acrylicfiber makers, who have been operating amid excess productioncapacity. Monsanto Co., which counts itself the largest U.S.producer, said there is more than enough domestic capacity toabsorb the closing of Du Pont's production lines.</TEXT></DOC>
