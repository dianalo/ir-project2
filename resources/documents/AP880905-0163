Webster's New World Dictionary is one of the nation'sbest-selling reference books and the dictionary of choice of manyof the nation's largest news-gathering organizations.   The Third College Edition goes on sale Tuesday at $17.95 forhard cover.   ``It is an absolutely excellent dictionary,'' said Ken Kister ofTampa, Fla., a librarian and the author of Dictionary Buying Guide.``Among all the good desk dictionaries, it is probably the best inthe coverage of Americanisms _ that is, words that originated inthis country.''   The dictionary defines a couch potato as ``a chronic televisionviewer.'' Fat city is ``a place or condition of prosperity,comfort, success, etc.'' And a junk bond is ``a high-yieldspeculative bond often issued to finance the takeover of acorporation.''   Those are some of the new terms among 11,000 American words andphrases and more than 170,000 entries in the dictionary.   Webster's New World Dictionaries, which has 16 employees inCleveland, is owned by Simon andamp; Schuster Inc. of New York.   Editor in chief Victoria Neufeldt, who joined the company 4{years ago, said planning for the Third College Edition began in themid '70s, and the staff began producing it in 1979.   The company's two full-time and one part-time readerscontinuously read books, newspapers, magazines and signs in searchof new words or new ways of using words.   References to new words are clipped and placed on index cardswith enough of the surrounding text for editors to be able todetermine how the words were used. Editors refer to the cards whentrying to decide whether a term is common enough to be included inthe dictionary. Words that are no longer used are deleted.   ``There's so little you can really delete,'' Ms. Neufeldt said.``There is just so much burgeoning of the vocabulary. And you haveto keep some of the old words'' because they are in books thatremain popular, she said.   Ms. Neufeldt said the Second College Edition was updated everytwo years, but some changes couldn't be made because it would haveinvolved altering too many pages.   She said, for example, the third edition uses the word``Muslim'' instead of ``Moslem'' to describe a follower of Islam.That change couldn't be made in the second edition updates becausereferences to ``Moslem'' throughout the dictionary would have hadto be altered, she said.   The third edition is the first produced by the company using acomputer database, Ms. Neufeldt said.   Kister said Webster's New World is one of two companies in theUnited States that can trace its heritage to Noah Webster, whowrote dictionaries around the year 1800. The other is MerriamWebster's of Springfield, Mass., which published the latest editionof its Collegiate Dictionary in 1983.   Although sales figures are not available, Kister said MerriamWebster's Collegiate Dictionary is the nation's best sellingdictionary. As many as 12 million dictionaries are sold each yearin the United States, and Merriam and New World both have soldmillions of copies.   New World is used by The New York Times, The Washington Post andThe Associated Press.   Other popular dictionaries in the United States are Random Houseand American Heritage.</TEXT></DOC>
