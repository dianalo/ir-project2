VanHaverbeke, ProjectManager, (202) 267-1181.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>In 1982 the Coast Guard received numerousrequests from owners and operators of small and uninspected passenger vesselsto reevaluate the prohibition of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and compressednatural gas (CNG) as cooking fuels on their vessels. As a result of itsreevaluation, the Coast Guard published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking(NPRM) in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on March 22, 1984 (49 FR 10685). This NPRM proposedto remove the prohibition of LPG and CNG as fuels for cooking applianceson vessels carrying passengers for hire, except ferries. This proposalalso promulgated standards governing the design, installation, and testingof cooking appliances using LPG and CNG, incorporating by reference theAmerican Boat and Yacht Council, Inc. (ABYC) and National Fire ProtectionAssociation (NFPA) standards for these systems. As a result of the comments received, substantive changes were made tothe original proposal. The most significant change was the acceptance ofthe National Fire Protection Association Standard 302, Pleasure and CommercialMotor Craft (1984 Edition), as an alternative to the ABYC standards. OnFebruary 6, 1986, a Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking (SNPRM)was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 4620) which reflected this change. Thecomment period for the SNPRM ended on May 7, 1986. NFPA 302 also provides guidance for the installation of heating and cookingsystems using wood or coal. This rulemaking provides for the use of thesefuels on uninspected vessels carrying passengers, and the Coast Guard hasdetermined that adopting the appropriate guidance in NFPA 302 will helpto minimize the fire risks associated with these systems. Therefore, theCoast Guard has included a provision in andSection; 25.45-1(d) to requirethat these systems, where installed after August 9, 1989, be in accordancewith NFPA 302. Since this provision was not included in the SNPRM, thisdocument is being published as an Interim Final Rule to provide for a commentperiod pertaining to andSection; 25.45-1(d). Following the comment perioda Final Rule will be published.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of Comments</ITAG> A total of 41 comment letters were received in response to the SNPRM,and they are discussed below. Since no issues were raised which had notbeen previously addressed in either the initial NPRM or SNPRM, only minorchanges to the proposal are being made. The final rule includes the Officeof Management and Budget (OMB) control number for the information collectionrequirements and a few minor administrative changes in the authority citationsfor the affected parts. Only one comment opposed allowing the use of LPG and CNG on vessels carryingpassengers for hire. One reason cited was that these gases are not alwayseffectively odorized, therefore a leak can go undetected. Another reasonwas that, although CNG is lighter than air at ambient temperature, a leakcould have a cooling effect on the gas causing it to become heavier thanair. This would result in the gas settling within the vessel rather thanrising. The comment espoused the attributes of liquid fuels including thefacts that they are visible, that combustible liquids are safer than flammablegases, that some flammable liquids can be easily diluted with water whenspilled and thus become noncombustible, and that liquid fuel in a puncturedtank can only leak down to the level of the hole while a compressed gaswill continue to leak until the supply is exhausted. The fact that combustible liquids are safer than flammable ones and thatflammable liquids are safer than flammable gases cannot be denied. It alsocannot be denied that any fuel used for cooking presents some degree ofrisk. What is important is that the degree of risk of any fuel be reducedto an acceptable level. The Coast Guard's position is that a flammablegas cooking installation meeting the requirements of this rulemaking willreduce the hazards of these gases to an acceptable level. The scenario of leaking CNG cooling itself sufficiently to become heavierthan air could only occur if the leak were either at the bottle or betweenthe bottle and the regulator. This is because the pressure of the gas downstreamof the regulator is too low to allow a sufficient cooling effect to occur.Since these regulations require the bottle and regulator to be containedin a locker vented to the atmosphere, it is not foreseeable that a significantamount of leaking CNG could enter the vessel, even if it cooled and wastemporarily denser than air.The only known odorization problem is with LPG. The reasons for this arethe fading of the odor over time, possibly caused by oxidation of the odorant;the settling of LPG because it is heavier than air, thus removing it fromnose level; and the undetectability of ethyl mercaptan, the odorant for95% of the LPG sold for residential use, by approximately 10% of the population.Both the LPG industry and the Consumer Product Safety Commission are awareof these shortcomings and are taking steps to remedy them. However, theCoast Guard does not consider these problems sufficient to disallow theuse of LPG on vessels.One comment suggested allowing CNG and LPG only on inspected vessels carryingpassengers for hire. One reason cited was the large number of uninspectedvessels carrying passengers for hire which are never boarded for an examinationto determine their compliance with applicable regulations. Other reasonswere the technical complexity of this rulemaking and the inexperience ofCoast Guard boarding officers with these systems, which would result ininadequate inspections of these installations.The Coast Guard considers these reasons unfounded. LPG and CNG cookingsystems are permitted on recreational vessels, and there is no evidenceto suggest that they present an unacceptable safety problem. Casualty statisticsfor recreational vessels do not indicate that LPG and CNG cooking appliancesaccount for a disproportionate number of vessel fires and explosions Sincerecreational vessels and uninspected passenger vessels are boarded andexamined similarly, there is no reason to believe that the uninspectedpassenger vessels will incur casualty losses in excess of those incurredby recreational vessels resulting from the use of flammable gases as cookingfuels. Therefore, this rulemaking does not prohibit the use of such fuelson uninspected passenger vessels.Two comments suggested that a specially designed container for LPG bottlestowage should be allowed to be installed within enclosed spaces. As statedin both the NPRM and SNPRM, for safety reasons, LPG bottles must be stowedin a locker or housing that is not located inside the vessel. Such stowagewill provide for the safe dispersal of the gas in the event of a leak fromthe bottle or its connections, even if the locker or housing is not properlyclosed or is opened while full of gas.One comment pointed out that NFPA Standard 302 is specifically writtento prevent fires and explosions and has been accepted by the American NationalStandards Institute (ANSI), while the ABYC standards are only intendedas guides. As part of this rulemaking project, both the NFPA and ABYC standardsfor LPG and CNG cooking appliance installations were compared and foundto be almost identical. All significant variances have been specificallyaddressed in this rulemaking and, where necessary, requirements in additionto the standards have been specified.One comment stated that the requirements that were in addition to thoseof the NFPA standard were unnecessary. These requirements include the odorizationof the flammable gas and that LPG cylinders be of the vapor withdrawaltype. The comment went on to say that this latter requirement is technicallycovered by section 6-5.8.1 of NFPA 302. Further, the comment recommendedthat a flame failure switch for the range burners should be installed inaddition to the one required for ovens by ABYC. The specific requirement in this rulemaking for the odorization of LPGand CNG is considered valid. This is a significant issue, especially whenone considers that LPG shipped by pipeline is not odorized because of enduser requirements. Since gasses are available which are not odorized, theCoast Guard wants to ensure that any flammable gas used on a vessel carryingpassengers for hire is odorized. Some means of vapor detection in the eventof a leak is considered essential. Most people can smell the odorants usedfor natural gas. Odorized gasses are readily available and the requirementthat odorized gasses be used is less expensive than requiring a mechanicalor electrical vapor detector system. Therefore, this requirement has beenretained. Regarding the flame failure switch, it is interesting to note that NFPA302 does not require one for either ovens or range burners while ABYC requiresit for ovens. The Coast Guard considers a flame failure switch to be essentialfor ovens since flame failure in an oven is not readily detectable. TheCoast Guard is not extending the requirement to include range burners becausethe failure of the range burner flame is more easily detectable visuallyand by the odor of gas. The requirement for LPG cylinders to be of the vapor withdrawal type isconsidered significant because it reduces the chance of a flareup occurringat a burner due to liquid LPG entering the supply line. NFPA 302 does notspecifically require that LPG cylinders be of the vapor withdrawal type,as ABYC A-1 does. Therefore this requirement has been retained. Two comments stated that referencing two industry standards plus imposingadditional requirements is too confusing to the boating public. They saidit would result in improper installations on uninspected passenger vesselsand recreational vessels. Further, they said obtaining copies of the regulationsand either the NFPA or ABYC standards will be too bothersome and boat ownersconsequently would not get them. They recommended that all the requirementscontained in the ABYC and NFPA standards be written into the regulations,and that the regulations include step by step instructions on installingCNG and LPG systems on any boat. Reducing the volume of regulations by incorporating existing industry standardsis consistent with the Freedom of Information Act (5 U.S.C. 552) and 1CFR Part 51. Since both the NFPA and ABYC standards are readily availableto the public and these organizations' addresses are given within the regulations,it is not considered necessary to restate these standards in the regulations.Those most likely to be involved with installing cooking systems on vessels,such as boat manufacturers and boat repair yards, already have these standards,as they are used extensively in the fabrication and repair of boats. Because of variances in the types and arrangements of vessels and owner'spersonal preferences, it would be impossible to include step-by-step instructionsfor all of the possible installation arrangements that could be used fora cooking appliance. Therefore, none have been included with this finalrule. As stated above, it is anticipated that most installations will bemade by boat repair yards or manufacturers who have the technical expertisenecessary to perform all work in a satisfactory manner. Neither the regulations,ABYC, nor NFPA standards are considered highly technical or confusing.However, any boat owner who wishes to personally install his own cookingappliance, but doesn't understand these requirements, should seek competentprofessional help. Nineteen comments stated that CNG cooking systems have been installed onmore than 15,000 boats in accordance with ABYC A-22 for over fifteen yearswithout any accidents; therefore, the ABYC standard should be acceptedwithout additional requirements. They said that the additional requirementsimpose a financial burden on these vessel owners without improving safetyand result in these vessels not being in compliance with the regulations.These regulations simply allow owners of vessels carrying passengers forhire to install CNG systems. It does not affect owners of recreationalvessels who are presently the primary users of these systems. Thus, theseregulations have no effect on existing installations on recreational vessels.The Coast Guard does not have data to support or refute the degree of useor the claimed safety record of CNG cooking systems. However, the CoastGuard's position is that stowage of CNG cylinders anywhere within enclosedspaces, particularly on a vessel carrying passengers for hire, presentsan unacceptable risk in the event of a leak at the cylinder, regulator,or associated fittings. Therefore, the additional requirement that theCNG cylinder and regulator be stowed in a vented housing located on theopen deck or open cockpit has been retained. Two comments stated that the NFPA committee that developed the 302 standardlacked expertise in the area of CNG. They also stated that two of the membersof the committee have a conflict of interest, because they are involvedwith firms that deal in the commercial LPG market which competes directlywith the CNG industry. The comments suggest that this bias resulted insimilar requirements in NFPA 302 for both LPG and CNG. To offset this biastowards LPG, it was recommended that persons from the American Gas Association(AGA) and International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) be on thecommittee. Although the membership of the committee included representatives fromthe LPG but not the CNG industry, the committee's expertise in the areaof CNG, whether there is a conflict of interest, and any bias towards theuse of LPG is not known by the Coast Guard. This is a moot point, however,because the Coast Guard would impose the same requirements regardless ofwhat was developed by the NFPA 302 committee. This is borne out by thefact that the Coast Guard is imposing certain requirements in additionto those established by NFPA 302. The Coast Guard regulations are basedon a careful analysis of the safety issues associated with LPG and CNGcooking installations. The final rule establishes the minimum level ofsafety necessary for cooking installations on vessels carrying passengersfor hire. One comment questioned the Coast Guard's concern about leaking CNG findingan ignition source before exiting the vessel. The comment suggested thaton a typical 55 foot boat having an interior volume of 1600 cubic feetit is impossible to reach the lower explosive limit, even if the entirecontents of a standard cylinder leaked out, since the gas rapidly diffuses.The Coast Guard disagrees. Any gas leak from a cylinder would result inthe potential for ignition of the gas. Even if only a partially filledcylinder were allowed to leak into the open atmosphere the gas could beignited. While it is true that certain locations in the compartment willbe above or below the explosive limits, at some distance from the cylinderthe gas concentration will be within the explosive range. One comment stated that increasing the pressure of the CNG supply by adjustingthe regulator to overcome the pressure drop through a remote controlledvalve would adversely affect the performance of the thermostats of stovesand prevent the fuel line from sealing itself if exposed to a fire. The Coast Guard disagrees. As an example, if the stove is meant to functionwith CNG at a pressure of five inches of water, and a valve in the supplyline results in a one inch pressure drop so that the pressure at the stoveis only four inches of water, then the installer may adjust the regulatorso that its discharge pressure is increased by one inch of water to raisethe pressure of the gas at the stove to five inches. This would make thepressure at the stove the same as if no remote control valve was installed.The problem of overpressurizing the tubing so that it would no longer beself-sealing could be eliminated by installing the remote shutdown valvenext to the regulator. This would result in all gas supply tubing beingsubjected only to the pressure allowed by the regulator setting.Six comments addressed the stowage of CNG in lockers. Three stated thatrequiring the lockers to be stowed above the waterline was subjective andarbitrary because leaking CNG will rise. Another comment said CNG shouldnot have to be in lockers at all for this same reason. Two other commentsstated that requiring CNG lockers to only open from the top and the coverto be gasketed to form a tight seal was inappropriate.The Coast Guard agrees that the stowage of CNG raises different concernsthan the stowage of LPG and has provided for different CNG stowage arrangements.Requiring CNG cylinders to be stowed in vented lockers which are vapor-tightto the hull or in lockers located on an open deck ensures that any leakinggas escapes in a controlled manner. Three comments said that the statement in the SNPRM that the economic impactof this rulemaking was minimal and required no further economic evaluationwas subjective and arbitrary. The reason cited was that CNG product manufacturers,distributors, and dealers, along with tens of thousands of CNG customers,will incur millions of dollars of expenses to bring their existing boatsinto compliance with these proposals without any increase in safety. Anadditional thirteen comments stated they had CNG cooking systems installedon their vessels in accordance with ABYC A-22, and it would cost them about$1,000 each to change their installations to comply with this rulemaking,while the safety of their boats would be decreased because any leakingCNG would not be able to escape.The concern about the economic impact reflected in the comments is unfounded.This regulation only applies to vessels carrying passengers for hire whichare not presently allowed to have LPG or CNG cooking appliances. Thus,there are no existing authorized cooking systems to be modified on vesselssubject to this final rule. The only individuals affected by this rulemakingare small and uninspected passenger vessel owners or operators who currentlydo not have a flammable gas cooking system installed and desire to installone and recreational vessel owners who have an installed gas cooking systemand now desire to carry passengers for hire. In both cases, either installinga new cooking system or modifying an existing installation is completelyvoluntary, and any expenses incurred are at the option of the owner. Therefore,there are no costs mandatorily imposed by this rulemaking. The safety of the boats with CNG systems will not be diminished by modifyingthem to comply with this rulemaking. Since each CNG cylinder must be stowedin a vented locker, any leaking gas will escape through the vented lockerto the atmosphere and not remain trapped in the vessel. One comment said that the requirements in this rulemaking that are in additionto ABYC A-22 were hastily conceived. Two others said these requirementswere biased towards the LPG industry as that industry will benefit financiallyfrom this final rule. The three comments recommended that the rulemakingbe dropped until it can be reviewed by an impartial panel. The Coast Guard's position is not biased towards the use of either fuel.It is anticipated that both the LPG and CNG industries will benefit financiallyby this rulemaking. Whether or not one will benefit more than the otheris a matter of conjecture. This rulemaking was not hastily conceived. During the past five years theCoast Guard has studied the problem, evaluated industry standards, developedneeded safety requirements, published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking anda Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking, and modified its proposalafter analyzing 91 comment letters.Five comments stated that it was understood that the Coast Guard was changingthe regulatory requirements for CNG cylinder stowage aboard charter vessels.They felt that this would be a mistake, because it would discourage theuse of CNG by increasing its installation costs. The extra cost would makeit cost prohibitive for the majority of the boating public.The requirements in addition to the current ABYC standard for CNG wouldbe limited to requiring that the fuel tanks be stowed outside of the hullinterior, segregated by a shut off valve which can be operated from a positionadjacent to the cooking appliance, and prohibiting the use of pilot lightsand glow plugs. These additional requirements were estimated to cost lessthan $100 per installation, a nominal cost far outweighed by the increasein safety. Further, these requirements are limited in application to vesselscarrying passengers for hire and would not have to be met by the generalboating public.One comment objected to the ABYC A-22 standard, because it allows the veryhigh pressure CNG cylinder to be stowed in accommodation spaces. This commentwent on to say that most fiber reinforced plastic boats have fairly ``tight''cabins, which would impede the flow of any leaking CNG to the atmosphere.This would result in the gas collecting at the overhead of a space andpresent an explosion hazard.The Coast Guard agrees with this hypothesis, and this is one reason whythe Coast Guard is imposing CNG cylinder stowage requirements in additionto ABYC A-22.One comment suggested ``grandfathering'' vessels that already have CNGinstallations.This is not considered necessary or desirable, because vessels carryingpassengers are not currently allowed to have these installations. Consequently,there is no one to ``grandfather''. For safety reasons, a vessel equippedwith a CNG installation not meeting this rulemaking and desiring to carrypassengers for hire must comply with the regulation.One boat builder stated that he would have to change his construction methodsto meet the requirements for CNG installations and that the additionalcost was not justified by any increase in safety.The Coast Guard recognizes that some existing designs for CNG installationson vessels built for recreational use would not meet the requirements ofthis final rule, largely due to tank placement. The cost of adapting thesedesigns to vessels carrying passengers for hire would be nominal, particularlyif done prior to construction. All builders who outfit for CNG will faceinstallation costs, regardless of their current design, and the Coast Guard'sposition is that these costs are reasonable and justified by the increasedlevel of safety.One comment said that the quantity of LPG allowed aboard a vessel shouldbe limited to an amount that would not exceed the lower explosive limit(LEL) if all the LPG were discharged within the volume of the hull.This idea appears fine on the surface, but it is an oversimplification.Aspreviously stated in a similar comment concerning CNG, any leaking gaswould not be evenly distributed throughout the hull's volume. Rather, therewould be a graduated concentration of LPG from the source of the leak tothe point of furthest spread of the LPG. This graduated concentration wouldspan the limits from above the upper explosive limit (UEL) to below theLEL. Somewhere along this gradient the concentration would be within theexplosive limits and present a genuine hazard, regardless of the quantityof LPG which may have been discharged. This recommendation has not beenadopted in the final rule.Two comments said that many boat operators carry excess amounts of LPGfuel, whereas this does not occur with CNG. The reason stated is that thereis a gauge on CNG cylinders so a person knows exactly how much fuel isavailable, but LPG cylinders are not so equipped and people consequentlycarry extra amounts to ensure they have an adequate supply. The commentsrecommended that LPG cylinders be equipped with a gauge so that the amountof LPG in the cylinder could be determined.Although a pressure gauge on a CNG cylinder will indicate how much gasremains, it will not work with LPG which is part liquid and part gas. AsLPG is used, the liquid evaporates and forms more gas to replace the lostLPG vapors. The result is that the pressure does not change until the liquidsupply is exhausted. Additionally, the amount of LPG can easily be determinedby weighing the bottle. Therefore there is no need to require a gauge.Knowing the amount of LPG or CNG remaining will not tell a person how muchcooking can be done with that amount. This is because the amount used overtime will depend on such things as the number of burners used and whetherhigh or low heat is used. Therefore knowing the amount of fuel left isonly of marginal use, and the recommendation has not been adopted.Three comments stated that the implementation of this rulemaking wouldhave disastrous consequences for boat owners. The reason given was thateven though the regulations are not applicable to recreational vessels,insurance companies may impose the standards on recreational vessels. Additionally,they feared that the Coast Guard may impose these regulations on recreationalvessels at some future date. Whether the requirements contained in this rulemaking are applied to recreationalvessels by insurance companies is a matter of speculation and beyond theCoast Guard's control. Since the NFPA and ABYC standards have been in placefor some time and are used as the industry standards for recreational vessels,it would seem logical that they would continue to be used and the additionalrequirements imposed by this rulemaking would not be applied to them. The Coast Guard has no intention, at this time, of applying these requirementsto recreational vessels. However, if the Coast Guard decides to expandthe applicability of the regulations to include recreational vessels, theregulatory process required by the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.553, must be followed. This includes giving the public the opportunityto comment on the proposal prior to it becoming a final rule. One comment recommended that LPG stove installations be capable of containingleaking gas and venting it overboard above the waterline. This is not concurred with, as such a requirement is not necessary or justifiable.As stated in the initial proposed rule, cooking appliances are normallyattended when in use and any leak occurring at the appliance should bereadily detected by the operator. The operator can activate the remotecontrol valve that is required by this rulemaking and stop the flow ofgas to the inside of the vessel. In the case of an unattended vessel, thewarning placard, required by the regulation, states that the cylinder valveshould be closed when the boat is unattended This would help to reducethe possibility of any gas leaking at the stove. One comment recommended that a mechanical leak detection system be installedon vessels using LPG, as this would eliminate the need for electrical powerin order for the system to operate. The installation of a leak detection system has not been adopted becauseit is not necessary. The Coast Guard agrees with the standards adoptedby both the ABYC and NFPA. If gas cooking systems are installed and maintainedin accordance with the requirements set forth in this rulemaking, thenthe installation of a leak detection system would not significantly increasethe level of safety so that its cost could be justified. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal persons involved in drafting this document are LieutenantCommander Mark G. VanHaverbeke, Project Manager, Office of Marine Safety,Security, and Environmental Protection, and Lieutenant Commander Don M.Wrye, Project Attorney, Office of the Chief Counsel. <ITAG tagnum="84">E.O. 12291 and DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures </ITAG>This rulemaking is considered to be non-major under Executive Order 12291and nonsignificant under the DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedurcs (44FR 11034; February 26, 1979). A final regulatory evaluation has been preparedand placed in the rulemaking docket. It may be inspected or copied at theMarine Safety Council, Room 3600, U.S. Coast Guard Headquarters, 2100 SecondStreet, SW., Washington, DC 20593-0001, from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Monday throughFriday. Copies may also be obtained by contacting the person listed under<T2>``FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT''. </T2>As explained in the final evaluation, these rules are deregulatory withthe exception of the installation standard for wood and coal burning stoves.They serve to expand the fuel choices available to vessel owners for cookingand provide simple guidance for the installation of wood or coal burningstoves. There are relatively minor differences between the cost of electric marinestoves and those with similar features that are fueled either by alcohol,LPG or CNG. Depending upon the individual features of an electric stove,its purchase price may range from less than $100 to over $400; typically,an equivalent alcohol stove would be priced $10 to $30 more, and an LPGor CNG stove priced $15 to $60 more. There would be little, if any, differencein installation costs. The differences in operating costs would be governedby the relative costs and availability of the fuels. This interim final rule includes installation requirements for wood andcoal burning stoves. The requirements are those of a generally acceptedindustry standard for boat construction and will help to minimize the firerisks associated with these systems. The cost of meeting this standardwill be minimal because it consists largely of requirements to locate,insulate, or shield the stove and its smoke stack from combustible materials.The standard will only apply to new installations so that there will beno burden placed on owners of vessels with existing stoves and owners orbuilders considering new installations will have the opportunity to considereven the minimal installation cost in their economic decision. Because the economic impact of this proposal is so minimal, we find thatno further economic evaluation is necessary. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Impact </ITAG>This rulemaking has been thoroughly reviewed by the Coast Guard and ithas been determined to be categorically excluded from further environmentaldocumentation in accordance with section 2.B.2.c and 2.B.2.1 of CommandantInstruction (COMDTINST) M16475.1B.
