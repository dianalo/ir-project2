L. 99-641, section 109, 100 Stat. 3556(1986). The substance of the current regulatory framework would be retained.Most of the proposed rule amendments and the few proposed new rules wouldbe of a procedural nature and would be designed to provide for a regulatorystructure of direct supervision by a registered futures association underCommission oversight. Such a structure would be consistent with the otherregulatory programs administered by the Commission under the CommodityExchange Act.Each leverage transaction merchant (``LTM'') would be required to be amember of a registered futures association, and the registered futuresassociation would be required to adopt rules establishing minimum financial,cover, segregation and sales practice requirements, and related reportingrequirements. With respect to each area, these rules would have to be atleast as stringent as the Commission's standards set forth in Part 31 ofthe rules promulgated under the Act. The registered futures associationalso would be required to have an arbitration procedure to settle leveragecustomer claims or grievances.The Commission would authorize the National Futures Association (``NFA'')to perform the function of processing the registration of an LTM and itsassociated persons (``APs''). The Commission has previously authorizedNFA by a series of delegation orders to perform the function of processingthe registration applications for all other persons that must registerunder the Act. LTMs would be required to file monthly reports of leveragecontract trading volume and pricing, and quarterly reports of closed-outleverage contracts, with the NFA instead of with the Commission. The NFAwould prepare summaries of those reports for the Commission. The specific exemption procedure currently set forth in Rule 31.24 wouldbe deleted, and the provisions of exemptions already granted under Rule31.24 to the existing LTMs which are of general applicability would beincorporated into the rules as appropriate. The only major function withrespect to leverage contracts for which the Commission would retain soleauthority would be the registration of leverage commodities.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Comments must be submitted on or before March 27, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments should be sent to the Commodity Futures TradingCommission, 2033 K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581, Attention: Officeof the Secretariat.

Of course, this burden will vary from firm tofirm based on the number of leverage contracts offered and sold, the numberof employees, the firm's financial condition and other factors.

Proposed Rule Amendments</ITAG>1. RegistrationThe principal rules governing the registration of LTMs and their APs areRules 3.17 and 3.18, respectively (17 CFR 3.17 and 3.18 (1988)). Most ofthe proposed amendments to those rules would change references from theCommission to the NFA because the Commission would authorize NFA to performthe function of processing the registration applications of LTMs and theirAPs.\1\<NOTE/> NFA would therefore assume the registration processing functionfor all persons who must register under the Act. Since NFA would be specificallyauthorized to perform the registration processing function, NFA would bespecifically named in Rules 3.17 and 3.18, as it is throughout the Part3 registration rules.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ The Commission is exploring the feasibility of authorizingNFA to perform the registration processing function for the existing threeLTMs and their APs, most of whom are also APs of affiliated futures commissionmerchants, without regard to whether the leverage moratoria are repealed.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Proposed amendments to Part 31 would generally refer toa registered futures association, rather than to NFA specifically, becauseit is possible that there could be another registered futures associationfor the futures industry as a whole, or for a segment thereof such as theleverage business. However, we would not anticipate another futures associationbeing registered in the foreseeable future (no applications are pending),so most of the direct regulatory responsibility will rest with NFA, underCommission oversight.The other proposed amendments to the Part 3 rules would eliminate the referencesto the Commission in those rules where there are currently references toboth the NFA and the Commission. The Commission proposes to amend Rules3.2 (notification of registration), 3.21 (fingerprinting exemption), 3.31(updates), 3.32 (new registration requirements), 3.33 (withdrawal), and3.40 and 3.43 (temporary licensing of APs). <T3>See also</T3> proposed amendments to Rule 31.6(b)(1) and the introductorytext of Rule 31.13(a). Deletions are proposed to Rule 3.3, since NFA wouldset registration fees for LTMs and their APs instead of the Commission,and Rule 3.20, since there are no more registration renewals. Recent changesto the rules provide for perpetual registration of firms and annual informationupdate filings. 53 FR 8428 (March 15, 1988).2. Part 31 Rules<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Moratoria Rules</ITAG>The Commission proposes to delete Rules 31.1 and 31.2 (17 CFR 31.1 and31.2 (1988)), which impose moratoria on the entry of new firms into theleverage business unless a firm was so engaged on June 1, 1978 (with respectto leverage contracts involving gold and silver bullion and bulk coins)or February 2, 1979 (with respect to leverage contracts involving all othercommodities upon which leverage contracts could have been offered at thattime, <T3>i.e., </T3>all but the agricultural commodities enumerated in the Act),respectively. Other provisions of the rules which relate to the moratoriaand their treatment of ``grandfathered'' firms, <T3>i.e., </T3>those firms which were engaged in a leverage business onthe dates specified in the moratoria rules, would also be deleted. Theseprovisions include paragraphs (c), (d) and (e) of Rule 31.5, and paragraphs(a)(1) and (b)(1) of Rule 31.6. <T3>See also </T3>proposed amendment to Rule 31.22. Accordingly, the regulatoryframework for an applicant for registration as an LTM or an AP of an LTMwould be comparable to the framework for any other applicant for registration.Such applicant would not be permitted to engage in business requiring registrationuntil registration had been granted.<ITAG tagnum="81">b. Status of Copper and Foreign Currency Leverage Contracts</ITAG>The amendments to section 19 of the Commodity Exchange Act enacted by Congressin 1986 made it unlawful for any person to offer to enter into, to enterinto, or to confirm the execution of, any leverage contract to or witha leverage customer involving any leverage commodity other than gold andsilver bullion, bulk gold and silver coins and platinum. These amendmentshad the effect of prohibiting new leverage contracts involving copper,which had been offered by International Precious Metals Corporation (``IPMC''),and our foreign currencies (British pound, Deutsche mark, Japanese yenand Swiss franc), which had been offered by Monex International, Ltd. (``Monex''),on and after the date of enactment of the Futures Trading Act of 1986,November 10, 1986. Congress also provided that its ban on new copper andforeign currency leverage contracts did not affect any rights or obligationsarising out of any leverage contract involving any of those commoditiesthat was entered into prior to November 10, 1986. The Commission sent lettersto IPMC and Monex in November 1986 to inform them of these amendments tothe law and to remind them of their obligations to service leverage contractsinvolving copper and foreign currencies, respectively, entered into priorto November 10, 1986, including providing cover for such open contracts.The Commission proposes to codify the statutory provision and its November1986 letter to IPMC and Monex in a new paragraph 31.5(c).Because of the reference to November 10, 1986 in that provision, the Commissionalso proposes to make technical amendments to the introductory text ofparagraph (a) and to paragraph (b) of Rule 31.5 to make clear that thecurrent reference to the``effective date of this section'' means the <T3>original </T3>effective date of the section, April 13, 1984. <T3>See also </T3>proposed technical amendments to Rules 31.13(b)(2) and31.21. Another proposed technical amendment to Rule 31.5 would be the deletionof paragraph (g), which relates to the denial, suspension or revocationof registration of an LTM or an AP of an LTM. The Commission adopted SubpartC of Part 3 of its rules, which applies to the denial, suspension of registrationfor all registrants, subsequent to the adoption of the leverage contractrules in 1984. Because of that and in light of the proposal to authorizeNFA to perform the registration processing function for LTMs and theirAPs, the Commission proposes to delete Rule 31.5(g).<ITAG tagnum="81">c. Definitions</ITAG>The Commission proposes to amend the definition of ``leverage commodity''in Rule 31.4(g), which currently includes references to copper and fourforeign currencies.\3\<NOTE/> IPMC closed out its last copper leverage contract in November1987, and Monex closed out its last foreign currency leverage contractin August 1988. The proposed amendment to the leverage commodity definitionreflects the amendment to Section 19 of the Act limiting the offer andsale of leverage contracts to those involving gold and silver bullion,bulk gold and silver coins and platinum. The Commission has reviewed allof the other definitions in Rule 31.4 and believes that changes theretoare neither necessary nor appropriate.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ The Commission also proposes to delete the reference toleverage contracts on foreign currencies in Rule 31.25(b), which governsthe treatment of carrying charges.<ITAG tagnum="81">d. Leverage Commodity Registration</ITAG>The Commission proposes to retain for itself the function of processingapplications for and granting leverage commodity registration under Rule31.6. This is the only function which the Commission would reserve completely;as experience is gained and leverage commodity registration becomes morestandardized, the Commission would consider amending the rules to authorizeNFA to register leverage commodities. The Commission also proposes to adda new paragraph (a)(6) to Rule 31.6 which would provide an additional conditionfor leverage commodity registration. This additional condition would bethat the leverage contracts based on the leverage commodity do not includesubstantial characteristics of other interests such as options, certificatesof deposits or other regulated instruments. The Commission required anextended period of time to resolve two leverage commodity registrationapplications, which were subsequently withdrawn, because the leverage contractscontained an option component. Such instruments may be extremely complexand may raise additional issues regarding customer protection. Moreover,such hybrid leverage instruments are not readily included under the presentregulatory program. Of course, the Commission may further consider inclusionof such instruments in its leverage rules as the Commission gains greaterexperience regulating an expanded leverage business.An noted above, the cross-references to current Rule 31.5(c) and ``grandfathered''LTMs are proposed to be deleted from paragraphs (a)(1) and (b)(1) of Rule31.6. No leverage commodity registration would be granted to a person thatwas not a registered LTM. The Commission would endeavor to coordinate withthe NFA so that the first leverage commodity registration would be grantedsimultaneously with the granting of registration as an LTM.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ The current fee for processing a leverage commodity registrationapplication is $4,500.<ITAG tagnum="81">e. Financial Early Warning System</ITAG>The Commission proposes to amend Rule 31.7(c) to delete the exception thatpersons who have applied for registration as LTMs are not required to sendearly warning notices to the NFA. Such applicants should be required tosend such notices to the NFA since the NFA, and not the Commission, willbe processing applications for registration as an LTM. However, an LTMor an applicant for registration as an LTM would still be required to filefinancial early warning notices with the Commission also. FCMs and IBs,and applicants for registration in either category, must do so under Rule1.12 (17 CFR 1.17 (1988)), the relevant provisions of which are incorporatedby reference in Rule 31.7(c). Paragraphs (a) and (b) of Rule 31.7 alreadycontain references to the capital, cover and segregation rules of a designatedself-regulatory organization (``DSRO''), and these provisions would becomeoperative under the Commission's proposed regulatory framework for an expandedleverage business.<ITAG tagnum="81">f. Cover and Segregation</ITAG>The basic cover requirements would remain the same. Under these requirements,at least 90 percent of the amount of physical commodities subject to openlong leverage contracts and, separately, at least 90 percent of the amountof physical commodities subject to open short leverage contracts, mustbe covered by the LTM. In addition, at least 25 percent of the amount ofphysical commodities subject to open long leverage contracts must be coveredwith physicals.\5\<NOTE/> Such physical cover may be subject to a loan not exceeding70 percent of current market value.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\The Commission granted an exemption to Monex with respectto cover of long foreign currency leverage contracts which permitted Monexto cover all of its commitments on such leverage contracts with futuresor option contracts traded on or subject to the rules of a contract market,rather than requiring 25 percent physical cover. A special net capitalhaircut applied to such cover in excess of 75 percent of Monex' leveragecontract obligations. This petition was granted because maintaining physicalforeign currency in United States depositories would prevent Monex fromearning interest thereon, and because the Commission did not want to permitsuch cover to be held in the country of origin where it could earn interest,but may be beyond the reach of United States jurisdiction and thus of littlebenefit to leverage customers. This exemption is now moot with respectto Monex, and it is unnecessary to codify this exemption in the rules becauseno new LTM could offer leverage contracts on foreign currencies.The Commission remains concerned about cover being held outside of theUnited States, and therefore it would retain the requirement that permissiblecover consisting of futures contracts or commodity options be limited tothose futures contracts or commodity options which are traded on or subjectto the rules of a contract market.\6\<NOTE/> Although the Commission has adopted rules to govern foreignfutures and option transactions (52 FR 28980 (August 5, 1987), most ofwhich are codified at 17 CFR Part 30 (1988)), foreign futures or foreignoptions to <T3>not</T3> constitute permissible cover for leverage contracts and theCommission does not propose to amend Rule 31.8 in that area.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\<T3>See also</T3> Rule 31.12(a)(2) (17 CFR 31.12(a)(2) (1988)), which requiresleverage customer funds to be kept in the United States.The Commission proposes three substantive amendments to its cover requirementsto incorporate the provisions of exemptions granted to the current LTMs.Rule 31.8(a)(2)(ii) would be amended to provide that permissible covercould also include one type of bulk gold coins for leverage contracts involvinganother type of bulk gold coins on an ounce-for-ounce basis if each typeof bulk gold coins used as cover is the subject of a leverage contractoffered by the LTM. Similar treatment also would be allowed for differenttypes of bulk silver coins. As noted, this is consistent with current Commissionpolicy. The Commission's cover rules currently permit bullion to be usedas cover for leverage contracts involving bulk coins and vice versa. Sincethe bulk coins are valued based upon their metallic content rather thantheir numismatic value, the Commission believes that it is appropriateto allow some fungibility between bullion and bulk coins for cover purposes.The Commission also proposes to codify two other exemptions which havebeen granted with respect to permissible physical cover for long leveragecontracts. These codifications would appear as new paragraphs (a)(2)(iii)and (a)(2)(iv) of Rule 31.8. The current paragraph (a)(2)(iii), which containsthe permissible futures cover for long leverage contracts, would be redesignatedas paragraph (a)(2)(v).One of the proposed additional forms of permissible physical cover of along leverage contract would be purchase of the leverage commodity subjectto the leverage contract under a two-day settlement procedure, which isthe normal cash market procedure. The LTM would be considered covered fromthe time the purchase order is confirmed, even though the LTM does notget possession or control of a warehouse receipt until settlement on thesecond following business day. Such a purchase could not be made from anaffiliated firm of the LTM.The other proposed additional form of permissible physical cover of a longleverage contract would be a long spot futures contact on the leveragecommodity subject to the leverage contract, if the LTM has stopped a non-transferabledelivery notice with respect to that futures contract and has otherwisecomplied with any procedures, including payment, necessary for taking delivery.If those conditions are met, the LTM would be considered to have coveredhis commitments to leverage customers with physical cover, even thoughthe LTM does not have possession or control of a warehouse receipt fortwo business days. The Commission notes that simply holding a spot futuresposition is considered to be futures cover rather than physical cover,since the futures position could be liquidated by an offsetting transactionprior to the beginning of the delivery process.In the cases referred to in the three preceding paragraphs, the alternativeforms of cover set forth in paragraph (a)(2)(ii) (bullion for coins andvice versa, as well as certain cross-coin cover) would be allowed, andthe LTM would be required to maintain records of the transactions subjectto inspection, copying and audit by the Commission and a DSRO. Also, theCommission would limit the amount of cover which could consist of purchasesunder a two-day settlement procedure or spot futures contracts on whicha delivery notice has been stopped to 10 percent of the LTM's obligationson long leverage contracts in each case. As noted, the Commission has grantedexemptions in these areas so these proposed new provisions of the coverrule, Rule 31.8, are consistent with existing Commission policy. The Commission is also proposing two technical amendments to the coverrule. Paragraph (b) would be amended to provide that a DSRO could takeaction against a member LTM for not maintaining adequate cover in accordancewith the DRSO's rules. Paragraph (e) would be amended to include a specificreference to Rule 31.28, which is proposed to be the new rule that wouldrequire any self-regulatory organization with member LTMs to adopt andenforce minimum cover requirements for its member LTMs at least as stringentas those of the Commission.\7\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ A similar amendment is proposed as a new Rule 31.12(h)regarding segregation rules of a self-regulatory organization. That isthe only amendment to Rule 31.12. <ITAG tagnum="81">g. Minimum Financial and Related Reporting Requirements</ITAG>The only amendments which the Commission proposes to Rule 31.9, the minimumcapital requirements for an LTM, are of a procedural nature. Paragraph(a)(2) of Rule 31.9 would be amended in a manner similar to the proposedamendment to Rule 31.8(e). The proposed amendment would include a specificreference to Rule 31.28, which is the proposed new rule that would requireany self-regulatory organization with member LTMs to adopt and enforceminimum financial requirements for its member LTMs that are at least asstringent as those of the Commission. Paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 31.9 wouldbe amended in a manner similar to the proposed amendment to Rule 31.8(b).The proposed amendment provides that a DSRO could take action against amember LTM for non-compliance with the DSRO's minimum financial requirements.The third proposed amendment to Rule 31.9 would make paragraph (d) thereofconform to Rule 1.18 (17 CFR 1.18 (1988)), the comparable provision forFCMs. Rule 31.9(d) requires an LTM or an applicant therefor to make a formalmonthly capital computation. That rule currently requires that the computationbe made available for inspection by any representative of the Commission,the DSRO of the United States Department of Justice. The proposed amendmentwould maintain that required availability of the monthly capital computationfor an LTM, but an applicant for registration as an LTM would only be requiredto make its monthly capital computation available to any representativeof the NFA, which will be processing LTM registration applications.The Commission has determined to maintain the current $2.5 million minimumadjusted net capital requirement for an LTM even if a regulatory structurewith direct supervision by a self-regulatory organization were adopted.As the Commission noted when it adopted the rules relating to leveragetransactions, ``if an LTM were to join the exisitng registered futuresassociation, the National Futures Association, or any other such associationwhich may be established, the LTM's minimum financial requirement or itsminimum cover requirement would not necessarily be lowered.'' 49 FR 5498,5512 (February 13, 1984).The Commission considered whether there should be an adjustment to theLTM capital requirement, but determined not to propose any such adjustmentbased on its regulatory experience and the off-exchange environment inwhich leverage contracts are traded. The Commission believes that any increasein supervision afforded by membership in a self-regulatory organizationdoes not affect the reasons why the Commission set financial requirementsfor an LTM substntially higher than those for an FCM, which were statedas follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">The leverage market is essentially a principals' market, and the purchaserof a leverage contract is solely dependent on the LTM for performance inthe contract. Because leverage contracts are not a traded on boards oftrade designated as contract markets by the Commission, there is no clearingorganization to take the other side of every trade, no FCM guarantee ofvariation margin to the clearing organization and no clearing organizationguaranty fund and assessment power, nor is there any established secondarymarket for leverage contracts.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Because the LTM takes the other side of every leverage contract enteredinto by a leverage customer and because the LTM is the sole guarantor ofperformance on the leverage contract, an LTM may properly be viewed ascomparable to the clearing organization of a contract market.\8\<NOTE/></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 49 FR 5498, 5512. Congress has also recognized the needfor a high net capital requirement for LTMs. Indeed, in proposing the 1982amendments to section 19 of the Act directing the Commission to promulgateregulations governing leverage transactions, which amendments were adoptedby Congress essentially as proposed, Congressman Glickman stated: ``I thinkthe CFTC has to set regulatory standards and high net capital requirementsto keep bad operators out of business.'' Excerpt from Unofficial Transcriptof Mark-Up Session, Subcommittee on Conservation, Credit and Rural Development,House Committee on Agriculture, at 59, April 1, 1982, with the permissionof Congressman Dan Glickman. <T3>Id.</T3> at n.32.The proposed amendments to the financial reporting requirements in Rule31.13 are also of a procedural and conforming nature. As noted above, thereference in the introductory text of paragraph (a) as to where to filean application for registration as an LTM would be changed from the Commissionto NFA. Paragraph (b)(2) would be amended to include a specific referenceto Rule 31.28, for the same reasons that a similar amendment is proposedto Rules 31.9(a)(2) and 31.8(e). Paragraph (c) would be amended to conformto a recent amendment to Rule 1.16, which is cross-referenced in Rule 31.13(c).<T3>See</T3> 53 FR 4606, 4612 (February 17, 1988).Paragraph (g)(2) would be amended to conform to a recent amendment to Rule1.10(d)(2)(ii) to accommodate the recently issued Financial AccountingStandards Board Statement No. 95 which requires companies to file a statementof cash flows as part of a full set of financial statements in place ofthe statement of changes in financial position. <T3>See </T3>53 FR 4606, 4609, 4611.\9\<NOTE/> Various amendments also are proposed to paragraphs (j), (k),(l) and (m) of Rule 31.13 to refer to the NFA or the DSRO, as appropriate,in lieu of the Commission. Those provisions relate to an LTM's choice offiscal year, extensions of time to file fianancial reports, and the availabilityof financial reports.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ There would also be conforming amendments proposed toForm 2-FR, the basic financial reporting form for LTMs, and to Rules 145.5(d)(1)(i)(H)and 147.3(b)(4)(i)(A)(<T3>8</T3>) so that the statement of cash flows would receive confidentialtreatment to the same extent as the statement of changes in financial position.Other minor, technical changes would be made to Form 2-FR to conform tocertain of the proposed rule changes discussed herein. Due to the natureof these changes, and the fact that Form 2-FR does not appear in the Codeof Federal Regulations, the proposed amendments in further informationon this aspect of the proposals should contact Mr. Patent at the telephonenumber listed above.<ITAG tagnum="81">h. Disclosure</ITAG>The Commission is proposing certain amendments to its disclosure requirementsfor an LTM, which are set forth in Rule 31.11, to take account of the factthat new leverage contracts are now limited to those involving gold andsilver bullion, bulk gold and silver coins, and platinum. The referenceto foreign currencies in the first paragraph of the bold-faced risk disclosurestatement would be deleted. The cross-reference to Rule 31.4(g) in Rule31.11(a)(2)(ii) would refer to the revised Rule 31.4(g) (1)-(4). Paragraph(a)(2)(viii) would also be amended to delete the specific reference tometal or coins in the provision referring to the possible need for an inspectionor assay at the customer's expense. The reference to metal or coins presumesthat there can be other types of leverage commodities, such as foreigncurrencies. Since new leverage contracts involving such other types ofleverage commodities are now prohibited, a specific reference to metalor coins in Rule 31.11(a)(2)(viii) is unnecessary.The Commission also proposes to amend Rule 31.11(e) to require LTMs tofile their Disclosure Documents with the NFA for review. A copy of theDisclosure Document would also need to be filed with the Commissoin, butNFA would be authorized to perform the review function.The other proposed amendments to Rule 31.11 would codify exemptions previouslygranted by the Commission. Rule 31.11(h) would be amended by adding a provisothat no notification to leverage customers is required if the LTM changesits carrying charge rate by less than one percent from the rate chargedat the prior month-end and the new rate is made available to leverage customersby means of a toll-free telephone call, and such availability is set forthin the LTM's Disclosure Document. However, a carrying charge rate changewhich amounts cumulatively to one percent or more as compared to the priormonth-end would continue to require an LTM to notify leverage customersof such a change within 24 hours of such a change by first class mail orother at least equivalent means of communication.The other proposed amendments to Rule 31.11 would be set forth in a newparagraph (1) and would codify another exemption granted by the Commission.Proposed Rule 31.11(1) would allow those LTMs which offer only long leveragecontracts to delete various specific references to short leverage contractsin their Disclosure Documents that are otherwise required by Rule 31.1\10\<NOTE/> Rule 31.11(1)(2) would provide that any LTM using a DisclosureDocument that deletes or disregards references to short leverage contractswould have to file a new Disclosure Document meeting all of the requirementsof Rule 31.11 at least 30 calendar days before it begins to offer any shortleverage contract.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Of the forty-six affirmative respondents to the surveywhich Congress directed the Commission to conduct with the assistance ofa registered futures association regarding interest in entering the leveragebusiness, two respondents indicated that they would offer long leveragecontracts only and ten others reported that they were undecided on thelong leverage/short leverage issue.<ITAG tagnum="81">i. Monthly Reports of LTMs</ITAG>Rule 31.16 requires each LTM to file a written report each month statingthe total number of open leverage contracts as of the end of the monthand the total number of leverage contracts entered into during the month.(These are to be shown separately for all customers and for commercialinterests, but to date no commercial interests have appeared in these reports.)The monthly report must also show the total number of leverage contractsrepurchased, resold, and liquidated by the LTM, as well as the number ofdeliveries and rescissions. The Commission proposes to amend Rule 31.16to require the LTM to file its monthly reports with the NFA instead ofwith the Commission, in accordance with the instructions and in the formatspecified. NFA would prepare summaries of these reports for the Commission.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ As in the case of the proposed amendments to Part 3 andother reference to applications for LTM or AP of an LTM registration, therewould be a specific reference to NFA in Rule 31.16. The Commission believesthat this is appropriate because the monthly report data should be centralizedand maintained with a single custodian, even if multiple self-disciplinaryorganizations for the leverage business are established.<ITAG tagnum="81">j. Separate LTM Entity</ITAG>The Commission proposes to retain the substance of Rule 31.22, which prohibitsan FCM from offering to enter into, entering into, or confirming the executionof, or soliciting or accepting orders for, any leverage contract. The Commissionwould retain this provision and proposes to extend it to include introducingbrokers (``IBs'') as well.\1\\2\<NOTE/> As noted above, the proviso to Rule 31.22 which applies whichapplies to ``grandfathered'' firms would be deleted since it is no longerrelevant.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\2\ One IB responded affirmatively to the leverage survey.Rule 31.22 therefore would require any FCM or IB seeking to enter the leveragebusiness to set up a separate firm to conduct LTM business.\1\\3\<NOTE/> The Commission believes that a separate entity requirementis appropriate based on the disparate nature of the financial requirementsapplicable to FCMs and IBs and LTMs. The Commission also believes thatthis structure is necessary to pervent financial difficulties of the LTMfrom having a direct impact on the adjusted net capital of the FCM or theIB.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\3\ Twenty-one FCMs responded affirmatively to the leveragesurvey.The Commission notes that Rules 3.12(f)(2) (ii) and (iii) and 3.18(f)(1)(ii) and (iii) prohibit an AP from being associated simultaneously withan FCM or IB and an LTM. The Commission further notes, however, that bothRules 3.12 and 3.18, in paragraphs (g) of each rule, contain a procedurewhereby any person adversely affected by the operation of each rule canfile a petition for exemption from the requirements of the rule.<ITAG tagnum="81">k. Petitions for Exemption</ITAG>The Commission proposes to delete the specific petition for exemption provisioncurrently set forth in Rule 31.24. The Commission adopted such a rule aspart of its original rules relating to leverage transactions because itwas establishing a major addition to the existing regulatory structureunder the Act, it was aware that in certain instances the new rules mightrequire an ongoing firm to alter or amend its current business practices,and the Commission believed it would be dealing with a small number offirms due to the moratoria rules. If the leverage business is allowed toexpand, there would be no ``grandfathered'' firms and there could be asignificant number of new firms.The Commission now has some experience with the rules relating to leveragetransactions and proposes to codify petitions for exemption already grantedwhich are of general applicability. The Commission therefore does not beleivethat it would be necessary or appropriate to maintain the extremely time-consumingspecial exemption procedure for an expanded leverage business. The Commissionwould expect to see greater uniformity if the leverage business is expandedthan has been the case with the ``grandfathered'' firms. However, any personinvolved in the leverage business would have whatever petition rights areafforded by the Administrative Procedure Act.<ITAG tagnum="81">l. Carrying Charges</ITAG>The Commission proposes to amend Rule 31.25(b) regarding carrying chargesto take into account another exemption granted by the Commission. The proposedamendment would permit the compounding of carrying charges on long leveragecontracts, <T3>i.e., </T3>including in the base upon which carrying charges are assessedpreviously assessed but unpaid carrying charges. If an LTM compounded carryingcharges on long leverage contracts, it would be compelled to pay compoundinterest on short leverage contracts. As noted above, the reference toleverage contracts on foreign currencies would be deleted.<ITAG tagnum="81">m. Quarterly Reporting Requirement</ITAG>Rule 31.26 provides that each LTM must file a quarterly report settingforth various information on each leverage contract which was either repurchased,resold or settled by delivery during the quarter, including, with respectto each contract repurchased or resold, the profit or loss incurred bythe leverage customer.\1\\4\<NOTE/> The Commission proposes to amend Rule 31.26 to require anLTM to file its quarterly report with the NFA, instead of with the Commission,in accordance with the instructions and in the format specified by theNFA. NFA would be delegated the function to review and analyze those reports.\1\\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\4\ The calculation of the profit or loss incurred on eachclosed-out leverage contract must include, among other things, the carryingcharges associated with each leverage contract. Monex and IPMC were grantedexemptions with respect to this rule so that they only are required toinclude contract-by-contract carrying charges in the profit and loss calculationsfor those contracts which were already open when Rule 31.26 because effectivefrom that point until the contract was closed out, since those firms hadnot previously calculated carrying charges in that manner. Since therewould be no similar problems for new LTMs, the Commission would not proposeto amend Rule 31.26 regarding the inclusion of contract-by-contract chargesin the profit and loss calculation. Monex and IMPC would, of course, bepermitted to continue to operate pursuant to the exemptions previouslygranted by the Commission with respect to Rule 31.26. However, Monex andIPMC will be required to be in full compliance with Rule 31.26 when theexemptions are no longer applicable, <T3>i.e., </T3>after all the pre-1986 leverage contracts are closed out.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\5\ As in the case of the proposed amendments to part 3and other references to applications for LTM or AP of an LTM registration,there would be a specific reference to NFA in Rule 31.26. The Commissionbelieves that this is appropriate because a computerized database wouldbe involved, as in the case of registration, and the data should be centralizedand maintained with a single custodian, even if multiple self-regulatoryorganizations for the leverage business are established.<ITAG tagnum="81">n. Mandatory Membership</ITAG>The Commission proposes a new Rule 31.27 to provide that each person requiredto register as an LTM must become and remain a member of a registered futuresassociation which provides for member LTMs, unless no such futures associationis so registered. This rule would be one of the key provisions necessaryto establish a regulatory structure for LTMs and their APs similar to thatfor other registrants under the Act, which is direct supervision by a DSROunder Commission oversight. Under current conditions, the Commission anticipatesthat NFA would have the direct supervisory responsibility for LTMs, althoughit is conceivable that another futures association could be registeredwith a broad self-regulatory mandate over the futures industry or one whichis limited only to the leverage business.<ITAG tagnum="81">o. DSRO Plan </ITAG>The Commission also proposes to add a new Rule 31.28, which would be acounterpart to Rule 1.52 (17 CFR 1.52 (1988)) that is applicable to FCMsand IBs. The most important provision of Rule 31.28 would require eachself-regulatory organization with member LTMs to adopt and enforce rulesprescribing minimum financial, cover, segregation and sales practice, andrelated reporting requirements for its member LTMs. These self-regulatoryorganization requirements would have to be the same as, or more stringentthan, the rules set forth in Part 31. This proposed rule, taken togetherwith proposed Rule 31.27, forms the basis for the self-regulatory structureof LTMs under Commission oversight. The sales practice requirements of the self-regulatory organization wouldbe required to encompass several of the Part 31 rules: 31.3 (general antifraud);31.10 (repurchase and resale of leverage contracts by LTMs); 31.11 (disclosureand confirmation statements); 31.14 (recordkeeping); 31.15 (purchase-and-saleand monthly statements to leverage customers); 31.17 (records of leveragetransactions); 31.18 (margin calls); 31.19 (unlawful representations);31.20 (prohibitions of guarantees against loss); and 31.23 (limited rightto rescind first leverage contract). All of those Part 31 rules would remainunchanged, except for rule 31.11, as noted above. The self-regulatory organizationwould be expected to assure that all LTM oral solicitations and promotionalmaterial adequately disclose the risks involved with respect to leveragecontracts. The self-regulatory organizations would be allowed to set their own feesfor conducting financial and sales practice audits, and the Commissionproposes to delete its schedule of fees for audits of LTMs set forth inAppendix B to Part 31. Rule 31.28 would provide for a situation where there is more than one self-regulatoryorganization for LTMs. If such a situation arises, which the Commissiondoes not presently foresee, the self-regulatory organizations could developa joint auditing arrangement to provide for a DSRO to conduct the auditingand monitoring for compliance with minimum financial, cover, segregationand sales practice, and related reporting requirements. These provisionsare also modelled on those in Rule 1.52 applicable to DSRO plans for FCMsand IBs. <ITAG tagnum="81">p. Arbitration </ITAG>The third new rule which the Commission is proposing would be Rule 31.29.The rule would require each self-regulatory organization with member LTMsto provide an arbitration or other dispute settlement procedure consistentwith the standards set forth in Part 180 of the Commisson's rules. <ITAG tagnum="84">III. Related Matters </ITAG>1. Paperwork Reduction Work The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (``PRA''), 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq. </T3>(1982), imposes certain requirements on federal agencies,including the Commission, in connection with their conducting or sponsoringany collection of information as defined by the PRA. In compliance withthe PRA, the Commission has submitted these proposed rule amendments, andtheir associated information collection requirements, to the Office ofManagement and Budget (``OMB''). This information collection contains anaverage response burden of 49 hours by 24 respondents for a total of 9,726.09burden hours. The frequency of response would be daily, weekly, quarterlyand annually. Persons wishing to comment on the information which would be required bythese proposed rule amendments should contact Gary Waxman, Office of Managementand Budget, Paperwork Reduction Project (3038-0029) Room 3228, NEOB, Washington,DC 20503, (202) 395-7340. Copies of the information collection submissionto OMB are available from Joseph G. Salazar, CFTC Clearance Officer, 2033K Street NW., Washington, DC 20581, (202) 254-9735. 2. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act (``RFA''), 5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq. </T3>(1982), requires that agencies, in proposing rules, considerthe impact of those rules on small businesses. The rule amendments beingproposed herein would affect LTMs. The Commission has previously determinedthat with respect to FCMs, based upon the fiduciary nature of FCM/customerrelationships, as well as the requirements that FCMs meet minimum financialrequirements, FCMs should be excluded from the definition of a small entity.\1\\6\<NOTE/> Since LTMs have a somewhat similar relationship with theircustomers as do FCMs, and since LTMs have a higher minimum financial requirementthan FCMs, LTMs should likewise be excluded from the definition of a smallentity. Therefore, pursuant to section 3(a) of the RFA, 5 U.S.C. 605(b),the Chairman certifies that these proposed rule amendments will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.Nonetheless, the Commission specifically requests comment on the impactthese proposed rule amendments may have on small entities. <ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\6\ <T3>See </T3>47 FR 18618, 18619 (April 30, 1982). <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>17 CFR Part 1 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements. 17 CFR Part 3 Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Registration. 17 CFR Part 31 Gold, Silver, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Leverage transactions.17 CFR Part 145 Freedom of information, Commission records. 17 CFR Part 147 Sunshine Act, Commission records.
