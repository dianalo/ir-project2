Testifying on the second day of hearings at a House Waysand Means subcommittee, Kenneth Gideon, assistant Treasurysecretary for tax policy, said &quot;it might be tempting toinfer&quot; from data that foreign-controlled firms are illegallyshifting income out of the U.S. by paying excessive prices intransactions with their overseas parents. But he said theremay be other explanations for the low tax bills, such as&quot;start-up expenses, acquisition indebtedness, the age of theinvestment.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Nevertheless, Mr. Gideon said, &quot;There's certainly datathere to indicate we should be looking carefully at thetransfer-pricing practices of foreign firms.&quot;   The hearings follow a nine-month investigation by thesubcommittee of 36 U.S. subsidiaries of foreign automobile,electronics and motorcycle companies. On Tuesday,subcommittee investigators testified that more than half ofthe companies paid little or no tax over a 10-year period,largely by inflating the prices they paid their parents forgoods, services and technology to reduce their U.S. incomes.U.S. tax law requires companies to charge market prices intransactions with related firms.</TEXT></DOC>
