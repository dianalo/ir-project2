The prosecutor said he would seek the death penalty against oneor more of the defendants at their upcoming trial.   Karen DeLayne ``Lanie'' Greenberger, who is accused of orderingRadin's killing in 1983, answered,``Not guilty,'' in a soft voiceand said she denied special circumstance allegations that thekilling was for financial gain and committed during a kidnapping.   Co-defendants William Molony Mentzer and Alex LaMota Martipleaded innocent in the Radin murder as well.   Deputy District Attorney David Conn said outside court: ``I cansay we will be seeking the death penalty on one or more defendants.As to which defendants has not been determined at this time.''   Radin, an obese, cocaine sniffing producer who was collaboratingwith Hollywood movie mogul Robert Evans on finances for ``TheCotton Club,'' disappeared on May 13, 1983. He was last seenstepping into a limousine with Mrs. Greenberger en route to a swankBeverly Hills restaurant for a meeting.   The case lay dormant nearly six years until Flynt'sbrother-in-law and former chief of security, William Rider, cameforward and gave damaging evidence.   He linked Mentzer and Marti, the former bodyguards, to theslaying and said he was told that Evans and Mrs. Greenberger paidfor ``the hit.''   Radin died of multiple gunshot wounds to the head. His body wasfound in a dry riverbed 60 miles north of Los Angeles where Ridersaid the Flynt bodyguards often held target practice.   Mrs. Greenberger, a reputed cocaine dealer who was once Evans'girlfriend, was ordered to stand trial along with Mentzer and Martiafter a four-month preliminary hearing which focused on Radin'sfast life in a drug infested circle of celebrities and shadycharacters.   Conn has alleged that Mrs. Greenberger hired Mentzer and Martias hit men because she saw Radin as an obstacle to her share of alucrative deal with Evans for money from ``The Cotton Club.''   Evans refused to testify at the preliminary hearing on FifthAmendment grounds, but his lawyer has said he had nothing to dowith the Radin murder.   Mentzer and Marti also pleaded innocent to charges in a secondmurder of a prostitute, June Mincher, which is unrelated to theRadin case.   Superior Court Judge Gary Klausner ordered the defendants toreturn to his court Aug. 11 for assignment to a trial judge. Thethree, who are being held without bail, waived their right to aspeedy trial until 60 days after that hearing at which Conn said hewould announce which defendants will be the subject of his effortsto gain death sentences.</TEXT></DOC>
