Time, too, to entertainclients. Golf outings, Outward Bound expeditions, tennistournaments, that sort of thing.   This year, though, a group of lawsuits may prompt somecompanies to take a second look at the outings -- andspecifically at their liability if something should gohorribly wrong.</LP><TEXT>   Next month marks the two-year anniversary of one of theworst tragedies the ad industry has seen. A white riverrafting trip on Canada's Chilko River, hosted by a DDBNeedham executive and attended by 10 other advertisingheavyweights, turned to disaster when the raft overturned,killing five people.   Now, three suits have been filed against DDB Needham andothers on behalf of victims' families. The first of the three-- brought by the family of James Fasules, who was a retiredDDB Needham executive -- is scheduled to come to trial Nov. 5in federal district court in Chicago.   In light of the cases, companies &quot;are looking at the workand play aspect of their business a little closer in terms ofresponsiblity,&quot; says John Kralovec, an attorney with theChicago law firm of William D. Maddux andamp; Associates, whichrepresents the widow of rafting victim Gene Yovetich, a DDBNeedham executive. &quot;The first {Fasules} verdict will have areal impact.&quot;   The Chilko case brings up the tricky question of when abusiness trip becomes a social outing, and vice versa -- adistinction that will probably become an issue in the trials.And the suits will almost certainly cause some chillingeffect on the most dangerous outings, such as rock climbingand wilderness expeditions, that some companies sponsor forclients.   The pending cases already paint a grim picture forcompanies sponsoring potentially dangerous outings.Typically, firms hosting trips that could be risky askparticipants to sign a waiver -- but the Chilko cases suggestthat isn't always enough.   Chilko participants did in fact sign waivers in aVancouver airport shortly before beginning their trip. But sofar, DDB Needham has been unsuccessful in trying to get thesuits dismissed based on the waivers. A federal judge inCincinnati -- where a suit on behalf of victim and formerProcter andamp; Gamble executive Robert Goldstein is pending --said the waiver was too broad and ambiguous. A judge in theFasules case came to a similar conclusion.   The lesson, says Stanley Chesley, the Cincinnati lawyerrepresenting Mr. Goldstein's family, is &quot;if it's dangerousenough to require a waiver, {companies} shouldn't be doingit. They're going to be held accountable.&quot;   Whether firms heed that advice remains to be seen. BobWolf, chief executive officer of ad agency Chiat/Day/Mojo,recalls a People magazine-sponsored trip he took a year and ahalf ago to Yosemite. &quot;It seemed like a tame exercise,&quot; hesays, &quot;until we went rock-climbing. I would think all thosecompanies will take a hard look at all those boondoggles andsay, `What if somebody killed themselves?'&quot; Yet, he adds, he&quot;probably would&quot; do it again: &quot;No one expects anything likethis to happen.&quot;   At Time Warner, which publishes People, a spokesman saysthe company still has outings, but &quot;we have been looking intothe whole phenomenon of outings and coverage even prior tothe rafting incident.&quot; He says Time Warner's legal andinsurance departments review suggested outings before theytake place.   The Chilko case also is prompting companies to think twiceabout the most mild-mannered outings, such as company picnicsand softball games. Felix Kent, a New York attorney whorepresents ad agencies, says that in light of the disaster,&quot;questions have come up about what happens on companypicnics, company outings, and to what extent does the companyhave liability.&quot; While &quot;I'm not sure any agency has changedits practices, there certainly have been questions. Companieshave examined their insurance policies to see to what extentthey're covered.&quot;   Several ad executives said they are indeed sponsoringfewer outings. Yet the impetus isn't the sobering events atChilko, they said. Instead, it's plain economics.   Jordan, McGrath, Case andamp; Taylor, for one, stopped hostingan annual golf tournament about three years ago, partlybecause of its high cost and partly because &quot;everybody'sworking hard, and clients value their free time more thanthey did 10 or 20 years ago when they had more of it,&quot; saysJack Taylor, vice chairman.   At D'Arcy Masius Benton andamp; Bowles, &quot;the accident, tragic asit was, hasn't influenced decision-making relative to cliententertainment,&quot; adds Roy Bostock, chairman and chiefexecutive. He, too, says that entertaining &quot;just isn't a partof the business anymore. People can't take five or six hoursduring the day and play golf. There are just more importantthings to do in helping clients.&quot;   Mr. Bostock says that a couple of years ago, some DMBandamp;Bexecutives tried to organize a golf outing at Shinnecock, aworld-class golf course on Long Island. &quot;It was canceled,&quot; hesays. &quot;As much as people would have liked to have done it,they couldn't find the time.&quot;   ---   Hidden Messages for Kids                                                                                                          American kids receive a barrage of hidden advertisingmessages from such powerful marketers as Coca-Cola, Disneyand Procter andamp; Gamble, according to a study released yesterdayby Consumers Union, publisher of Consumer Reports.   Topping the consumer group's list of gripes with corporatemarketers is the practice of distributing free teachingmaterials, which are actually thinly disguised ads, accordingto the report. The study also singles out licensingagreements, celebrity product endorsements, commerciallysponsored kids clubs, &quot;advertorials&quot; and the placement ofsuch products as cigarettes and alcohol in movies.   In the report, Grey Advertising Senior Vice PresidentCarol Herman is quoted as saying: &quot;You've got to reach kidsthroughout their day. . . . You've got to become part of thefabric of their lives.&quot; A Grey spokeswoman says that theagency wasn't asked to participate in the report, and thatMs. Herman's comments were taken out of context.   ---   Ad Notes. . . .                                                                                                          SNEAKER REP: Reebok's much-publicized contractnegotiations with pop singer Madonna, who was to star in anew ad campaign for the sneaker company, have been calledoff, Reebok said yesterday. In a brief statement, Reebok saidit couldn't come to an agreement with the singer on &quot;timingand schedules,&quot; in part because of her concert tour. Reebokdeclined to elaborate or to say if other issues, includingfinancial terms, were part of the problem.
