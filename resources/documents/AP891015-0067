It's just goingto cause people to become more cautious as they should have beenfrom the beginning,'' said Donald T. Senterfitt, vice chairman ofSun Trust Bank Inc. in Orlando, Fla.   It was a snag in bank financing for an employee buyout of UnitedAirlines that triggered the stock market drop. Worry among tradersthat banks had become more wary of buyouts caused stocks ofcompanies targeted for takeover to tumble and the weakness spreadgenerally through the market.   In the last 90 minutes of trading, the Dow Jones industrialaverage plummeted 190 points in the worst drop since the October1987 crash.   But Senterfitt and other bankers attending cocktail receptionsand seminars at the American Bankers Association, the industry'slargest trade group, were making no apologies Sunday.   ``What we were seeing was a house of cards, bound to cometumbling down. I hope the United Airlines thing marks a moreconservative approach by banking throughout,'' Senterfitt said.   In a leveraged buyout, or LBO, investors _ often managersseeking to thwart a hostile takeover _ borrow heavily in order totake over a company or a division of a company.   The new owners either cut costs or sell off parts of the companyto pay back the loans. The danger is that the restructuredcompany's debt burden is so heavy it will topple into bankruptcy inan economic downturn.   Large banks, as profits in their traditional business ofcommercial lending grew scarce, have turned increasingly toleveraged buyout financing as a source of lucrative fees.   In fact, according to analysts, some large banks are as heavilyinvolved in LBO lending as they are in Third World debt. If all ofthe LBO lending went sour at once, a number of large banks would beinsolvent.   As of June 30, according to Robert Litan of the BrookingsInstitution, five large banks had made leveraged loans exceedingtheir equity: Bank of Boston, 103 percent; Bank of New York, 127percent; Continental Bank, 123 percent; Manufacturers Hanover, 107percent, and Wells Fargo, 119 percent.   ``Aggregate LBO exposures, including related equity investments,exceed equity for most money-center banks,'' analyst James J.McDermott Jr. of Keefe Bruyette and Woods warned the Senate BankingCommittee earlier this month.   Regulators have noted the trend. Both the Federal Reserve, whichoversees bank holding companies, and the Office of the Comptrollerof the Currency, an arm of the Treasury Department which regulatesnationally-chartered banks, formally warned banks last fall toexercise caution in LBOs and ordered government examiners toclosely scrutinize such lending.   That's starting to have an effect, according to Thomas P.Rideout, outgoing ABA president and vice chairman of First UnionNational Bank, Charlotte, N.C.   ``It appears to me that regulators have a very good handle onthe bank exposure to LBOs. ... That kind of publicity would make acredit committee more cautious,'' he said.   Rideout said it's only natural that banks, with signs of asoftening economy emerging, would apply tougher lending standards.   ``When you've had an expansion as long as this one, you alwaysthink as a banker or businessman, `When am I going to have totighten my belt and hunker down a bit,'' he said. ``This would bethe wrong time to invest in an airline, or any other industry, ifyou think you have doubts about their bottom line.''   Robert Dugger, the banking association's chief economist, saidto a degree it is the buyout deals themselves that have changed,not bankers' attitudes.   ``What you saw in the events of last week was a transaction thatjust didn't meet the flinch test. It required more faith in thefuture than bankers are accustomed to affording,'' he said.   ``It doesn't mean bankers have become more conservative. Itreflects the fact that the leveraging in these deals has had to getprogressively deeper in order to remain profitable,'' Dugger said.   Banking analyst Alex Sheshunoff of Austin, Texas, who wasattending the convention, said, ``I think (the stock drop) is ahealthy end to a phenomena that longer term could be detrimental toboth the companies involved, the economy and the country. ...   ``I think it's important that the LBO thing is slowing down nowrather than reaching the proportions that it could have.''</TEXT></DOC>
