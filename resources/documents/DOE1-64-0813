Ifit does, under today's conditions, there is a high risk of the use ofnuclear weapons. They must act to reduce that risk. There is much thatthey can do. They should begin by accepting two overriding principles.First, they must recognize that each side must maintain a stable deterrent- a nuclear arsenal powerful enough to discourage anyone else from usingnuclear weapons. Neither the United States nor the Soviet Union shouldmove in a way to destabilize the other's deterrent or to provide an incentivefor a preemptive strike. That's absolutely imperative. Second, they mustrecognize that nuclear weapons have no military value whatsoever otherthan to deter one's opponent from their use. All arms negotiations, militarystrategies, war plans, weapons development and military-force structuresshould be based on that principle. If they accept those two premises,they are well on the way toward reducing the risk of nuclear war. Still,there is much more they can do. Some of these steps would require agreementwith the Soviet Union, but many could be taken unilaterally. The authordemonstrates this point by listing 18 actions which, if taken, wouldreduce the risk of use of nuclear weapons in the event of a militaryconfrontation between East and West.</TEXT></DOC>
