It is clear that because the Northern Pacific Gold Bonds had the enormous land grant as collateral, and because the indenture and mortgage stipulated payment be made in U.S. gold coin, investors were satisfied their loan was secure.    Clearly, the Northern Pacific Gold Bonds were not classified by contemporary investors as junk bonds since the offering price was 135 for the 4% Prior Lien Gold Bonds due 1997, and 118 1/2 for the 3% General Lien Gold Bonds due 2047.
