The People's Daily saod Burma extradited Li Danian and WangYueping to China in February after they sneaked across the border.   The paper said Li, Wang and another accomplice were running abusiness in Hunan province that went into debt. To pay back thedebt they decided to start robbing banks.   It said the trio began robbing banks in June 1987, strikingamong others the Agricultural Bank and the Industrial andCommercial Bank in the Hunan city of Yueyang. The paper said theyfailed to steal any money.   On July 7, 1987, the paper said, the trio broke into anotherYueyang bank and killed a bank guard and a clerk. Still, no moneywas stolen, it said.   Li and Wang then fled to Burma. Their accomplice, Yi Maohua,stayed behind and was captured.   The paper said the three were sentenced on Monday and would beexecuted soon. China executes people with a bullet to the back ofthe head.   Chinese papers have been devoting more space to reports on crimein recent years. In almost every case, when they report on bankheists, the papers say the robberies end in failure.   The apparent reason for this is that the state-run press doesn'twant to encourage copycat crimes.</TEXT></DOC>
