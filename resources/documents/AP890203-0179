Dumas is to spend Sunday and Monday in Tehran on the first visitby a French Cabinet minister since the Islamic revolution ousted thelate Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi a decade ago.   Nine Americans, three Britons, an Irishman, an Italian and aBelgian still are hostages in Lebanon, most in the hands of ShiiteMoslem extremists loyal to Iran. Held longest is Terry A. Anderson,chief Middle East correspondent of The Associated Press. He waskidnapped March 16, 1985.   Kauffmann, freed last May with two French diplomats after morethan three years in captivity, said on Radio Monte Carlo he andothers in a delegation from the French League of Human Rights metwith Dumas earlier this week.   He reviewed the conversation with Dumas, then said: ``A finalpoint close to my heart, the problem of foreign hostages in Lebanon.Mr. Dumas should intercede with the Iranians, who have shown theyhad total power to have us freed, and I still say they are 100percent masters of the situation.''   A Lebanese serving a life term in France for a failed attempt toassassinate a former Iranian prime minister urged Iran on Wednesdayto demand his freedom, which he said was promised in the deal forKauffmann's release.   ``I ask the Iranian government, which guaranteed the accordbetween France and the parties concerned during the liberation ofthe hostages, to remind France of its engagements,'' Anis Naccachesaid in a statement issued through his lawyer.   ``It is inadmissible to say that relations between the twocountries are good while five soldiers of Islam are still in Frenchprisons.''   President Francois Mitterrand had said he would be willing topardon Naccache if all French hostages were freed at once, but aftertheir release last May, French officials denied Naccache was part ofthe deal.   He led a five man team in the July 1980 attempt on ShapourBakhtiar, the shah's last prime minister.   A bystander and a policeman were killed and three police officerswounded. Bakhtiar, who still lives in the Paris area, was not hurt.</TEXT></DOC>
