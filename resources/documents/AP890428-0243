Why should I stab the dead?'' said John Baldwin, Utah'ssecurities director and president of the North American Associationof Securities Administrators.   State securities officials met here Friday to discuss punitiveaction against Drexel, which faces losing its state brokeragelicenses and fines for its role in the Wall Street insider tradingscandals.   State laws generally bar convicted or admitted felons fromoperating in the securities industry. Drexel has agreed to pleadguilty to six crimes and pay $650 million in penalties to resolve arange of fraud charges brought by the Justice Department.   But legal challenges in New York to the federal judge who mustapprove the criminal pact and a separate settlement with theSecurities and Exchange Commission are delaying resolution of thefederal case indefinitely.   Until Drexel formally enters a plea, the states are powerless topunish Drexel.   ``The states can't do anything until there is an order issued ofsome sort,'' Susan Bryant, Oklahoma's securities administrator, whoheads a panel of state regulators examining Drexel, said Thursday.   But, she added, ``It probably will mean states will startnegotiating a settlement with Drexel even though there is no orderyet.''   Anticipating a wave of punitive action, lawyers for Drexel havemet with regulators in all 50 states.   ``We're eager to come to a satisfactory resolution in thismatter,'' Drexel spokesman Steven Anreder said Friday in New York.``We understand (the states') concerns and interests.''   Regulators said they are studying punitive measures againstDrexel, including administrative fines, suspensions andsupervision, and concessions that would permit the firm to continuedoing business, such as selling municipal bonds, with towns andcities. State-by-state monetary settlements are another possibility.   California, home to Drexel's high-yield junk bond division thatdoes hundreds of millions of dollars in business, has aninsider-trading statute and could bar Drexel employees and restrainits business if it can trace back to the state part of the fraudsalleged by the federal government.   Delaware, where Drexel is a registered broker but has nooffices, could strip the firm's license and levy fines _ $10,000per violation, an amount dwarfed by the $650 million the firm hasagreed to pay the federal government.   Losing its license may not matter to Drexel because it isquitting the retail brokerage business, selling about half of its43-office network to Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. The rest ofthe department is still on the auction block.   Anreder said the decision was not motivated by the possibilityof losing its broker-dealer license, but by declining business dueto bad publicity and a weak Wall Street business environment.   ``We intend to retain our broker-dealer license in every state.We do transactions with people and you just may as well beregistered. It makes it much easier,'' he said.   While states don't have to prove any individual investors boughtstock in companies tied to the alleged frauds, it is widelybelieved that citizens in all states were affected. As such, statescould file civil lawsuits against the firm seeking restitution.   But regulators said they plan to let class-action suits coverclaims by investors who say they were defrauded by Drexel'sactions. About 12 such suits have been filed, in states includingCalifornia, New York and Pennsylvania.   In taking action they also said they would consider the broadnature of the SEC pact, which places Drexel under unprecedentedsupervision for three years and forces it to overhaul itsmanagement and compliance procedures.   ``To the extent that they cleaned up their overall act, we haveto take that into account,'' said G.W. McDonald, assistantenforcement commissioner in California's Department of Corrections.   ``It's fair to say the states will rely on the investigationsthat have taken place to date,'' he said.   McDonald said he expects some regulators to follow the SEC'slead; because the commission didn't strip Drexel's brokeragelicense, they feel the states shouldn't either.   Regulators also predict that Drexel bond financier MichaelMilken _ who is fighting sweeping fraud and racketeering charges _may try to block release of internal company documents that stateofficials may seek to obtain, further delaying investigation ofDrexel's activities.</TEXT></DOC>
