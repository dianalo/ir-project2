Letter from Brian M. McNamara,Managing Director, Market Surveillance, NYSE, to Mary N. Revell, BranchChief, Exchange Regulation, SEC, dated July 7, 1989.The proposed rule change was noticed in Securities Exchange Act ReleaseNo. 26969 (June 23, 1989), 54 FR 28139 (July 5, 1989).The proposed rule change would adopt new Exchange Rule 106, which requires(1) quarterly contacts by specialist units, at least one of which is anin-person meeting, with a senior official, of the rank of Corporate Secretaryor higher, of each of the specialist unit's listed companies, and (2) semi-annualcontacts by specialist units, off the Exchange floor, with the 15 largestNYSE member organizations, any other member organizations that are significantcustomers of the specialist unit, as well as any other member organizationsthat request such contact.

As describedabove, Rule 106 will require specialists to contact quarterly senior officialsof the issuers of each of their specialty stocks. The Exchange believesthat these quarterly contacts will help to foster an understanding of thespecialist function, the operations of the Exchange market, and the marketsthat are maintained in the listed companies' stocks. In addition, as describedabove, Rule 106 will require semi-annual contacts between specialist unitsand NYSE member organizations. The Exchange states that the purpose ofthese semi-annual contracts is to discuss the service, operational, andcompetitive requirements of the member firms.The Exchange also has proposed to adopt Form 106, which would be used byspecialist units to report to the Exchange, on a semi-annual basis, contactsmade with their listed companies and member firm customers pursuant toRule 106.The Commission finds that the proposed rule change is consistent with therequirements of the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicableto a national securities exchange, and, in particular, the requirementsof Section 6, and the rules and regulations thereunder.\5\<NOTE/> By promoting a better understanding of the needs of listedcompanies and member organizations and fostering communications among specialists,listed companies, and the NYSE member firms, proposed Rule 106 and Form106 are consistent with the requirements of Section 6(b)(5) of the Act,which requires that rules of an exchange be designed ``to prevent fraudulentand manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and equitable principlesof trade, to foster cooperation with persons engaged in regulating, clearing,settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating transactionsin securities, and, in general, to protect investors and the public interest. . .'' Moreover, the new requirements will help specialists to performtheir functions better by receiving input on performance by issuers andmember firms. In addition, proposed Rule 106 (and Form 106) implement aprovision of the Exchange's specialist job description that was approvedby the Commission in Release No. 34-26523.\6\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ 15 U.S.C. andSection; 78f (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ <T3>See </T3>note 4, <T3>supra</T3>.Rule 106 and Form 106 also are consistent with the requirements of Rule11b-1(a)(2)(iv) under the Act, which mandates that the rules of a nationalsecurities exchange include ``[p]rovisions stating the responsibilitiesof a specialist acting as a broker in securities in which he is registered.''\7\<NOTE/> By enumerating the contacts a specialist must make with listedcompanies and member firm customers, Rule 106 defined in detail for NYSEspecialists their obligations and responsibilities under Section 11 ofthe Act\8\<NOTE/> and Rule 11b-1 thereunder.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ 17 CFR 240.11b-1 (1989).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ 15 U.S.C. 78k (1982).It therefore is ordered, pursuant to Section 19(b)(2) of the Act,\9\<NOTE/> that the proposed rule change is approved.\1\\0\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ 15 U.S.C. 78s (b)(2) (1982).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\0\ The Commission also approves the Exchange's requestthat current NYSE Rule 106 be re-designated as Rule 106A so that the proposednew rule approved herein can be designated as Rule 106.For the Commission, by the Division of Market Regulation, pursuant to delegatedauthority.\1\\1\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\\1\ 17 CFR 200.30-3(a)(12) (1989).<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jonathan G.
