The Office of Personnel Management approved a ``demonstrationproject'' Thursday calling for the FAA to boost pay by as much as 20percent for some employees at hard-to-staff air traffic controlcenters in the New York, Los Angeles and Chicago areas.   The five-year experiment will determine whether incentives are aneffective tool in recruiting and retaining personnel, TransportationSecretary James Burnley said.   ``This project should make it possible for FAA to achieve fullstaffing at facilities where living costs, highly complex operationsor other factors have made them less attractive locations foremployees,'' he said.   More than 60 percent of the 2,000 employees eligible for thebonus pay will be controllers, Burnley said. The rest are safetyinspectors and the technicians who maintain air-traffic controlcomputers and other equipment.   Journeyman, or full-performance-level, controllers and someinspectors at the nation's busiest airports make up to $60,683annually in base pay, so a 20 percent salary differential wouldboost their pay to as much as $72,819, FAA spokesman Fred Farrarsaid today.   However, he said not all controllers and inspectors receive thatmuch, and Farrar was not certain of the pay scale for technicians.   The FAA said facilities chosen for the pay incentives include airroute traffic control centers at Chicago and New York, controltowers and terminal radar approach control centers at O'HareInternational and Los Angeles International Airport, terminal radarapproach centers at New York and Santa Anna, Calif., and flightstandards district offices at Los Angeles; Farmingdale, N.Y.; ValleyStream, N.Y.; and Teterboro, N.J.   The pay incentives are to begin next May.</TEXT></DOC>
