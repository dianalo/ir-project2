<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-0995 </DOCNO><TEXT>The Pittsburgh coal was sampled with three columns of oriented blocksin two adjacent surface mines in Harrison Co., WV and one column of 15-cmincrement samples from an outcrop 50 km to the northeast in MonongaliaCo., WV. Each of the oriented blocks was described as to lithotype. Lithotypebands continuous across the blocks were sampled and analyzed for maceraland mineral matter content. Each of the 15-cm increment samples was alsoanalyzed for maceral and mineral matter. The individual lithotypes werecompared as to maceral and mineral matter content between the two benchesof the Pittsburgh coal and between the three columns. The data were convertedto equal 10-cm intervals by stratified random sampling. Petrographiczones were established based upon stratigraphic variations in maceralgroup and mineral matter content. The lateral continuity of the zoneswere observed over short (75 m), intermediate (575 m) and long (50 km)distances. The geochemical environment of deposition of each zone observedin the column samples was interpreted based upon the maceral and mineralmatter content and the chemical coal model presented by Renton and Cecil(1979). 17 refs., 22 figs., 4 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
