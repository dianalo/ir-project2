His latest work, &quot;Joe Turner's Come and Gone,&quot; which opened here last week at the Arena Stage, follows on the heels of &quot;Ma Rainey's Black Bottom&quot; and &quot;Fences,&quot; which last year won both the Pulitzer Prize and the New York Drama Critics Circle Award.    It is not just that Mr. Wilson has written a series of powerful individual dramas, but that they have begun to add up to a significant body of work. Mr. Wilson has set himself the task of writing a play about the black experience in each decade of this century. &quot;Ma Rainey&quot; was concerned with the 1920s, when black musicians were beginning to find a voice in show business but were still faced with fearful discrimination both inside and outside the profession. &quot;Fences,&quot; the current Broadway hit, deals with a black family in the 1950s, in that transitional period on the threshold of the '60s when the younger generation was preparing to take steps against the frustrations their parents had suffered.    In &quot;Joe Turner's Come and Gone&quot; Mr. Wilson moves back to the second decade of the century. The time is 1911 and the scene is a black boarding house in Pittsburgh, where Mr. Wilson grew up amid poverty and prejudice. In the play, Seth Holly (Mel Winkler) and his wife, Bertha (L. Scott Caldwell), own a boarding house that had belonged to Seth's father before him. Their boarder of longest standing is Bynum Walker (Ed Hall), a &quot;voodoo&quot; or &quot;conjure&quot; man who helps people by incantation and by administering roots and herbs. It is largely from Bynum that the play gets its decidedly mystical quality.    Another boarder is a young worker recently arrived from the South, Jeremy Furlow (Bo Rucker). He worries Seth, who doesn't want migrants replacing black workers already in Pittsburgh or misbehaving and giving blacks a bad name. Jeremy lives with Mattie (Kimberleigh Aarn), a young woman who first came to the house to consult Bynum about a man who left her and ended up staying with Jeremy.    The most troubling and mysterious boarder is Herald Loomis (Delroy Lindo), a tall man in a black hat and long black coat, which he never removes. Herald arrives with his small daughter Zonia (Kippen Hay), looking for his wife, Martha (Angela Bassett), who has disappeared. Suspicious of Herald from the start, Seth soon develops an outright antipathy for the seemingly sinister intruder.    All of Seth's boarders are part of a pattern that Mr. Wilson has expertly developed. They have all been deserted by a partner and are looking desperately for a permanent home and for personal attachment. Bynum, the conjure man, claims that his chief mission is &quot;binding people.&quot;    The title of the play also refers to separation and deprivation. Joe Turner was a hated figure in the South in the early part of the century. Though slavery had long since officially ended, he was a bounty hunter who indentured black men for seven years and sold them to white plantation owners. The black women around Memphis sang a song about how Joe Turner came, took their men and then was gone. Herald Loomis had been one of these, and when he emerged from his seven years he went looking for his wife only to find that she had left their daughter with her mother and gone North.    In order to summarize the play and analyze its main theme, I may be distorting the work by making it sound starkly political. Yet Mr. Wilson's work is not overtly political. In &quot;Ma Rainey,&quot; &quot;Fences&quot; and &quot;Joe Turner,&quot; black people have unmistakably been mistreated by white society. But the focus is always on blacks themselves: how they react to white oppression and to each other. Just before the close of the second act of &quot;Joe Turner,&quot; the people in the boarding house hold a &quot;Juba&quot;: an ecstatic religious outpouring of song and dance. In the midst of it Herald falls to the floor in a paroxysm of tremors and is unable to rise. &quot;My legs won't stand up,&quot; he keeps repeating. &quot;My legs won't stand up.&quot;    Toward the end of the play Herald finally meets his wife, and in a harrowing, explosive scene, they reveal the wrongs they have suffered. Following a final, frightening exorcism, Herald discovers that he is able to stand. The play is thus a parable: Despite all the indignities, Herald has discovered his pride and identity. The Joe Turner who had enslaved him is &quot;gone.&quot;    Like Mr. Wilson's other major plays, &quot;Joe Turner&quot; is directed by Lloyd Richards, head of the Yale Repertory Theater, where the play was first produced. Mr. Richards has provided an authentic, energetic production. As in &quot;Fences,&quot; the first act of &quot;Joe Turner&quot; is overlong, with an excess of exposition. To compensate for this, Mr. Richards has directed the actors to perform in a forceful manner that at times undercuts the play's lyricism. What is needed is for Mr. Wilson to make judicious cuts so that the performances can be modulated to let the poetry shine through. The lead actors are impressive, especially Mr. Lindo, but the cast overall is not as strong as it might be to give the play its maximum impact.    Even in its present form, however, nothing can hold back the volcanic force of the second act. Like any natural-born dramatist, Mr. Wilson knows how to build to an inexorable climax in which deeply felt emotions, cutting insights and levels of meaning meet in one devastating, immensely moving moment. In this scene Mr. Richards and his actors have given him full measure. </TEXT></DOC>
