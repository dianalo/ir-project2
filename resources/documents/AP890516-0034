(A</HEAD><TEXT>   For far too long, a privileged class of violent and repeatoffenders have calculated that crime really does pay, that ourcriminal justice system is a crapshoot where the risks are worththe rewards.   Well, it's time we changed the odds and upped the stakesenormously.   And we will lead the way.   We'll do our part and then some.   But no federal effort can succeed without the full partnershipof the cities and the states that you so nobly represent.   Unfortunately, nowhere is your front line role more evident thanin the honor roll that will be read today of 161 officers killed inthe line of duty last year; 152 were state or local cops, and youare the first line of defense, and your respective governments havean obligation to adopt tough legislation and provide the resourcesin police, prosecutors and prisons to fully back you up.   At the trial of Eddie Byrne's executioners, there was testimonythat the hit was ordered from prison to send a message to thepeople behind the badge, and one witness said that they hoped tosee the attack on the television news at Rikers Island.   Well today, we have a message of our own.   We're going to take back the streets by taking criminals off thestreets.   And it's an attack _ (applause) _ it is an attack on all fourfronts: new laws to punish them, new agents to arrest them, newprosecutors to convict them, and new prisons to hold them.(Applause.)   I am announcing today, and there is no more fitting place thanright here, a comprehensive new offensive for combatting violentcrime _ for Eddie Byrne, for every officer we honor here today, andfor America.   The first front of this campaign, new laws, starts with thesemiautomatic and so-called assault weapons that criminals havetaken as their gun of choice, and again, common sense has to playan important part in this discussion.   The fact of the matter is nearly half the households in thiscountry have guns, and guns are already out there.   And the overwhelming majority are legitimately owned forlegitimate purposes.   But in contrast to legitimate gun ownership is the chilling factthat something like 80 percent of all firearms used by felons arestolen or otherwise unlawfully obtained.   Throughout our nation's history, the hard lesson we've learnedis that criminals will get guns.   And so let me be very clear about our response.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
