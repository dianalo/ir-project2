PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Dukakis, trying to add someMidwestern momentum to his win in New Hampshire, was pushed byDemocratic presidential rivals to defend his economic policies andcomplained during a debate that ``my name was taken in vain.''   Missouri Rep. Richard Gephardt, another Democratic front-runner,also found himself in the cross fire Friday during the latestdebate of Democratic presidential candidates, as Jesse Jacksonasked if the Missouri congressman was ``proud of your vote for theReagan tax cut in 1981.''   Gephardt and Dukakis, the governor of Massachusetts, were thebiggest targets in a debate that was freewheeling but less fiestythan a jangling exchange among the candidates in Texas the daybefore.   The St. Paul debate came as the focus of the presidentialcampaign shifted briefly away from the Super Tuesday battlefieldmainly in the South and returned to the Midwest, where Minnesotaand South Dakota hold contests on Tuesday.   Though the delegates at stake from those two contests pale nextto those to be allocated in the South, the closely bunchedcandidates are looking for a Midwestern edge to propel them towardthe March 8 Super Tuesday primaries and caucuses.   In the latest debates, the candidates tried to block Gephardtand Dukakis from gaining more momentum. Gephardt was hit on tradeand taxes, while Dukakis was forced to defend his budget plans.   Gephardt defended his overall tax voting record, saying most ofthe tax cut derided by Jackson ``went to ordinary people.''   ``That was the trigger of this whole deficit crisis,'' Jacksoncountered.   And Dukakis agreed: ``It wasn't just a bad vote as a matter oftax policy, it was the worst trade bill ever passed.''   The Minnesota debate drew five of the six Democratic contenders.Tennessee Sen. Albert Gore Jr. was absent.   Dukakis fired one of the most direct shots of the debate atGephardt's trade policies, warning that ``we've got to do more thanwave a fist at our foreign competitors.''   But Gephardt queried: ``Why is everyone defending unfair tradepractices?''   After the candidates' exchange was interrupted by a moderator,Gephardt predicted ``we'll never finish on trade.''   Dukakis complained that ``my name was taken in vain'' by GaryHart, who demanded to know why Dukakis had not followed his exampleand released a budget proposal.   ``The reason my colleagues have not put out budgets is becausethey don't want to tell the American people the facts,'' Hart said.   ``I'm the only person on this platform who has balanced abudget,'' retorted Dukakis.   Turning to Sen. Paul Simon, Hart asked, ``Why don't you put yourbudget out, Paul?''   When a moderator interrupted the exchange with a joke about``exchange your budgets tomorrow,'' Hart complained: ``I thoughtthat's what we were here to debate.''   The candidates paid homage to former Vice President Walter F.Mondale, one of the ceremonial sponsors of the debate, withGephardt saying that Mondale's call for a tax hike during hisfailed 1984 Democratic presidential bid was ``to his everlastingcredit.''   Jackson noted that this campaign is the first in 20 years thatMinnesotans don't have a favorite son candidate to vote for.   ``Don't despair, let me be your favorite son,'' Jackson said.   ``I want to be your other favorite son'' interjected Simon.   Friday's debate was sponsored by a series of groups, includingthe St. Paul Pioneer Press Dispatch and radio and televisionstation WCCO in Minneapolis.</TEXT></DOC>
