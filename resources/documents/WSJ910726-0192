So say Pennsylvania State University demographers DavidEggebeen and Daniel Lichter. Using Census Bureau data from1960 through 1988, they note that child poverty rates plungedin the 1960s, remained stable in the 1970s and then rose inthe 1980s. By 1988, one in five children was officiallyclassed as poor.   The two researchers then calculated what the situationwould have been if the 1988 children had been distributed inthe same proportions as the 1960 children amongmarried-couple families, female-headed single-parent familiesand male-headed single-parent families. Their finding: Thechild poverty rate for 1988 would have been one-third lower.And if the family arrangements of 1980 had persisted throughthe 1980s, the 1988 rate would have been 11% lower.   The study estimates that over half of the increase in thechild poverty rate from 1980 to 1988 -- a rise to 20.3% from15.8% -- was due to changes in living patterns. &quot;Our resultsclearly indicate that changes in family structure haveexacerbated the apparent decline in the economic status ofAmerican children,&quot; the authors say.                                                                                                          Juvenile Custody Rates   And Offenses Worsen                                                                                                          THE NUMBER of juveniles in custody has surged in recentyears, the government reports -- and they are being held formore serious offenses.   The average daily population of juveniles confined instate and local detention centers, group homes and otherpublic correctional or shelter facilities was 56,123 in 1989,according to the federal government's Office of JuvenileJustice. This was 5% higher than in 1987 and 14% higher thanin 1985. Taking into account the decline in the totaljuvenile population, custody rates actually rose 20% over thefour years. The figures don't include an additional 37,822juveniles held in private facilities.   Federal officials couldn't say whether the increase stemsfrom a rise in offenses or more vigorous law enforcement.State laws set the upper age limits for juvenile-courtjurisdiction; in most states, the limit is 17 or 18.   Nineteen out of 20 juveniles held in public custody in1989 were detained for offenses that would have been classedas crimes if committed by adults. The small remainder wereheld for so-called status offenses, such as truancy orrunning away.   The number detained for violent personal offenses such asmurder, rape or aggravated assault increased substantially,particularly for females; this was the first increase in theviolent-offense category since 1983. The number of juvenilesheld on drug or alcohol offenses jumped 58% from 1987,accounting for 12% of all those in custody.   Eight out of 10 juveniles in the public institutions weremales. Blacks, Hispanics and other minority youth accountedfor three-fifths of all those held. Western states had thehighest custody rates, the Northeast the lowest.   The number of young people held in privately runfacilities actually fell slightly from 1987 to 1989. Privatefacilities hold a higher proportion of females than publicfacilities do, and generally have a younger population. Twoout of three juveniles in private facilities are held fornondelinquent reasons, such as status offenses or for havingbeen neglected or abused.                                                                                                          Firefighters, Waiters   Have Stress in Common                                                                                                          COPS and inner-city school teachers rank as having themost stressful jobs.   Men's Health magazine asked three job-stress specialiststo rate stress levels, physical and psychological, of varioustypes of work. Points were assigned for the degree of danger,the number of deadlines or quotas to be met, the extent ofcompetitive pressures, and the amount of responsibility inthe job compared with the degree of control the job holdercan exercise over results.   The rankings, clearly not rigidly scientific, werenonetheless intriguing. Not too surprising, perhaps, was thetop rating for police and inner-city teachers; they got highscores on danger, having to meet quotas or deadlines, andlarge responsibility with limited control over the outcome.Bunched right behind them was a diverse group: air-trafficcontrollers, firefighters, medical interns, assembly-lineworkers and waiters. Waiting on tables, the experts say, is a&quot;classic high-demand/low-control job.&quot;   Customer-service representatives, securities traders,newspaper editors, advertising executives andpublic-relations specialists scored fairly high. Middlemanagers averaged just about the same score as salespeopleand lawyers. Least stressed among the top 20: bankers.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          CHILDREN get hurt or poisoned less often in child carearrangements than at home, the government's Centers forDisease Control says. It conducted a survey to see whetherthere were grounds for frequently expressed worries thatout-of-home care exposes children to greater risk of injury.. . . Military personnel are &quot;significantly less likely&quot; thancivilians to use drugs, but &quot;significantly more likely&quot; tosmoke and drink heavily, reports the Research TriangleInstitute, a nonprofit research group in North Carolina. . .. Women who spend several hours a day watching television areabout twice as likely to be obese as those viewing TV lessthan an hour a day, according to an analysis by Larry Tuckerof Brigham Young University and Marilyn Bagwell of ArizonaState.</TEXT></DOC>
