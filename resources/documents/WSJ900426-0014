Goldman, Sachs andamp; Co. and Morgan Stanley andamp; Co., theunderwriters, late yesterday priced the offering at $11.25 ashare, 22% below the midpoint of the recently estimated pricerange.</LP><TEXT>   The underwriters previously were forecasting that theSafeway shares would fetch $13 to $16 apiece. The offeringtotals 10 million shares.   Trading in the shares is expected to begin today on theNew York Stock Exchange under the symbol SWY. A spokesman forone of the underwriters wouldn't comment on the pricereduction.   Safeway, an Oakland, Calif., supermarket chain, was takenprivate by a KKR-sponsored corporation in 1986. Since then,Safeway has reduced debt and considerably improved itsoperating profit margins.   Underwriters had pitched Safeway on the basis of itsrising cash flow. But potential investors apparently havebalked at valuing Safeway only on the basis of cash flow, asdistinct from earnings.   Several said the initial price range was steep, given thatSafeway's 1990 net income has been forecast at 40 cents ashare. For 1991, net has been forecast at 85 cents a share.(As of February, Safeway's holdings included 13.6 millionshares of Vons Cos. common stock.)   Investors also cited the fact that, over the next fiveyears, cash from operations will be plowed into buildingstores and remodeling old ones -- and not into reducingSafeway's $3.1 billion in debt.   This past summer, Safeway had envisioned a bigger offeringpriced at perhaps $20 a share. However, the crash injunk-bond prices in September and investors' disenchantmentwith leveraged stocks reduced the market's appetite.   Neither KKR nor any members of Safeway's management areselling stock in the offering. KKR is an investment firm withoffices in New York and San Francisco.   Since the buy-out, Safeway has sold inefficient operationsand remodeled or built from scratch more than 100 stores.Labor costs have been cut, and warehouse and buying practiceshave been computerized.   Almost half of Safeway's 1,100 stores are so-calledsuperstores, with 45,000 items ranging from frozen yogurt topizza. Profit margins on specialty items such as Chinesefoods -- an increasingly important part of the business --are especially high.   Safeway's operating profit as a percentage of salesclimbed to 3.2% in 1989 from 2.3% in 1986. Sales last yearwere $14.32 billion.   Analysts generally think that more stock in Safeway may beoffered in future years, perhaps to finance acquisitions, andto enable KKR and affiliated investors to reduce their stake.   KKR was thought to be eager to have the current offeringcome to market in order to establish a track record in thepublic market for Safeway shares.</TEXT></DOC>
