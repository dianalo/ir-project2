The analyzer uses a PMD 85 microcomputer.The basic functions of the analyzer were tested such as the accuracyof sampling, the reproducibility of determinations and reliability inlong-term operation. In the uranium concentration range of 0.5 to 80mg/l U, free acid of 5 to 100 g/l H/sub 2/SO/sub 4/, nitrate ions of10 to 100 g/l NO/sub 3//sup -/, the coefficient of correlation for theindividual determinations was found to be better than 0.999. The reproducibilityof determinations was better than 3% rel. (E.S.). 1 ref., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
