KeithRenshaw Minneapolis, MinnesotaandM;There's no harm in trying, but I wouldn't count on it working the firsttime--at least not with a null modem cable.andP;  Check the printer'sdocumentation to determine how it communicates with the device on the otherend of the line and have a cable made up accordingly.andP;  For example, someolder serial printers send a DSR (Data Signal Ready) signal and expect the PCto reply with DTR (Data Terminal Ready).andP;  If the software doesn't send a DTR,the printer won't print.andP;  In that case, the solution is to create a cableconnection so that the DSR signal is looped back to the pin on the printerend that expects to receive the DTR.andP;  The printer, in effect, creates its oneof dozens of hand-shakingandM;This is only one of dozens of hand-shaking scenarios the printer mightemploy, so it's difficult to luck into the right cable configuration.andP;  In theabsence of printer documentation, a breakout box can help you analyze theserial inputs and build the correct cable.andM;Using Extended RAMandM;I purchased a copy of DOS 4.0 with the understanding that it would run inextended memory, freeing up some of the lower 640K.andP;  But no matter how Iinstall the new version, the MEM command reports that all extended memory isstill available.andP;  How can I get DOS 4.0 to run in extended memory?andP;  And howcan I get programs such as SideKick to load into extended memory? MarkGoldman Hilo, HawaiiandM;DOS 4.0 won't really run in extended memory.andP;  It will install selectedportions of itself, such as the buffers used by FASTOPEN and VDISK, into LIM4.0 expanded memory if instructed to do so.andP;  Even then, only a fraction ofthe lower 640K is freed up for use by application programs.andM;If you have a 386, you can utilize extended memory indirectly by using DOS4.0's XMAEM.SYS driver to make your extended memory emulate expanded memory.andO;This solution won't work on a 286.andP;  A number of commercial and public domainutilities, however, transform 286 extended memory into LIM 4.0 expanded.andP;  DOS4.0 may not work with some of them.andM;DOS 4.0 also doesn't help you load TSRs such as SideKick into high memory.andO;Again, if your machine is a 386, you can buy third-party programs that will.andO;Both 386-to-the-Max from Qualitas and QEMM-386 from Quarterdeck OfficeSystems let you load TSRs and device drivers into extended memory, makingmore room for conventional programs to run in the base 640K.andM;Revive a Hard DriveandM;After years of faithful service, my Seagate ST-225 hard disk seems to begiving out on me.andP;  I'm getting read errors from DOS, and certain files won'tload unless I try them several times.andP;  Is there any alternative to scrappingmy disk and buying a replacement? John Rice Fayetteville, North CarolinaandM;You may still have plenty of life left in your old ST-225.andM;It's possible that the drive surface has developed defects severe enough toinhibit the storage of data.andP;  Or mechanical wear in the read/write leadmechanism may have caused it to drift out of alignment with the sectors asthey were originally laid down when the drive was formatted.andM;The good news is that neither problem is anything that a new low-level formatwon't take care of.andP;  Don't give up on your drive until you've tried areformat.andP;  But for caution's sake, make a backup first.andM;Disabling Shadow RAMandM;How can I disable ROM shadowing on a 386 clone with 1Mb of memory and an AMIBIOS?andP;  I want to use the 384K of extended memory beyond the base 640K for avirtual disk under MS-DOS 3.3.andP;  But the extra RAM is now taken up by imagesof the ROM and EGA BIOS.andM;Also, if I add a second megabyte of memory, can I run OS/2? A.M.andP;  SauvandSevres, FranceandM;Some 386-based Pcs with ROM shadowing permit the shadowing to be toggled onand off; some don't.andP;  Check the CMOS setup options in your PC to see if yourBIOS has an option to disable ROM shadowing.andP;  If it does, select the optionfor turning it off.andP;  If it doesn't, then you may have to add more memory torun a RAMdisk in extended memory.andP;  A second megabyte is more than enough.andP;  Orsee if you can use a smaller RAMdisk, since disabling ROM shadowing will slowperformance.andM;Even if you can't turn shadowing off, you may be able to use the part ofextended memory for a RAMdisk anyway.andP;  Most ROM BIOSes are less than 128K inlength, and EGA BIOSes are typically much smaller.andP;  In a 1MB configuration,that leaves around 256K of extended memory for other purposes.andP;  Try it; youcan't hurt anything by attempting to load a program there.andM;MS-DOS 3.3 comes with a RAMdisk called RAMDRIVE.SYS.andP;  Install it in yourCONFIG.SYS file with the line DEVICE=RAMDRIVE.SYS 128 /E to create a 128Kvirtual disk in extended memory.andP;  Be sure to include a pathname ifRAMDRIVE.SYS is somewhere other than the root directory.andM;The bare minimum for running OS/2 Version 1.2 is 2MB.andP;  To run OS/2 in justthat much memory, you'll have to give up the DOS compatibility environment byediting the line PROTECTONLY=NO in the CONFIG.SYS file to readPROTECTONLY=YES.andP;  One caveat: being able to run OS/2 means more than simplyhaving enough memory.andP;  OS/2 is extremely sensitive to the hardware it'srunning on, and ideally you should have a version of OS/2 from the companythat made your PC.andP;  If no special version is available, try using othermanufacturers' brands.andM;Partition ProblemsandM;I run DOS 4.01 on an AT-compatible PC with a 40MB hard disk partitioned usingOnTrack's Disk Manager.andP;  I tried using PC Tools' Mirror utility with the/PARTN switch, which saves a copy of the drive's partition table in casedisaster strikes.andP;  It didn't work.andP;  Apparently PC Tools doesn't recognize aDisk Manager partition table.andM;Is it really necessary to save the partition table?andP;  If the hard diskcrashes, won't I end up having to repartition it anyway?andP;  And next timearound, would I be better off using FDISK instead of Disk Manager to do thepartitioning? Ella M. Hilton Philadelphia, PennsylvaniaandM;Mirror won't recognize nonstandard partitions, including those created byOnTracks Disk Manager and Storage Dimensions' SpeedStor utilities.andP;  It willrecognize partitions set up by FDISK.andM;The next time you reconfigure your hard disk, use FDISK.andP;  The primary benefitin using Disk Manager is that it allows you to set up multiple DOSpartitions, regardless of what version of DOS you're using, even though DOSitself didn't support multiple DOS partitions until Version 3.3.andP;  Sinceyou're already using DOS 4.0, you have no reason not to use FDISK.andP;  Butremember that before you run FDISK, you must first back up your hard disk.andO;FDISK will destroy all the files.andM;As far as backing up the partition table goes, hard disks can crash in a lotof different ways.andP;  If the partition table is inadvertenly overwritten or asurface defect prevents it from being read, DOS won't recognize the drive.andO;In this case, a backup copy will save you from having to repartition andreformat the drive.andP;  But if the drive fails for any other reason, chances arethe partition table will b e left intact.andP;  The most conservative approach isto back up the partition table using Mirror and back up the contents of eachpartition with PC Tools' hard disk backup utility.andP;  Then you're prepared forthe worst.andM;Are Faster CPU's OK?andM;I want to replace the Intel 8088 in my 4.77MHz XT clone with a 10MHz NEC V20I saw advertised in your magazine.andP;  Will the 10MHz CPU work in my system?andO;Peter Waldes Astoria, New YorkandM;It sure will.andP;  The 10MHz designation on the chip is the speed it is ratedfor, meaning that it will safely run at any clock speed up to but notexceeding 10MHz.andP;  It shoudn't even break a sweat in your 4.77MHz system.andM;Black-and-White BlahsandM;How can I configure my PC to work with a color scheme other than white onblack? Peter Mendiola Miami, FloridaandM;A simple way to set colors is to create your own utility that works like CLSbut clears the screen to something other than white on black.andP;  The followingDEBUG script will create a program named CL that sets the screen to white onblue.andP;  Run DEBUG, and when you see the hyphen prompt, type each line as shownhere, pressing Enter after each line:andM;N CL.COM E 0100 B4 12 B13 10 CD E 0105 10 B6 18 80 FB E 010A 10 74 08 33 C0 E010F 8E D8 8A 36 84 E 0114 04 B4 0F CD 10 E 0119 8A D4 FE CA 53 E 011E B8 0007 B7 1F E 0123 33 C9 CD 10 B4 E 0128 02 5B 33 D2 CD E 012D 10 C3 RCX 2F W QandM;CL.COM will work with any number of lines and columns displayed on thescreen.andP;  Place it in a directory in your PATH so that you can run it fromanywhere, and get in the habit of typing CL rather than CLS to clear thescreen.andP;  Add a CL command to your AUTOEXEC.BAT file to set the colors atstartup.andP;  You must not have DEVICE=ANSI.SYS in your CONFIG.SYS file for CL towork.andM;If you're not happy with CL's default white-on-blue color scheme, you canchange it with DEBUG.andP;  From the color table, pick a number from 0 to 7 forthe background color and a number from 0 to 9 or a letter from A to F (reallyhexadecimal numbers) for the foreground.andP;  Some combinations can causeheadache-inducing flashing letter.andP;  Experiment with different color schemes.andO;For the best results, use a color from 8 to F for the foregroung.andP;  The codefor yellow on a red background, for example, is 4E.andP;  To modify CL.COM for ayellow-on-red screen, type:andM;DEBUG CL.COM E 0122 4E W QandM;The code combinations for intense red on white is 7C, for intense cyan onblue, 1B, and so on.andM;CL.COM Screen ColorsandM;0  Black 1  Blue 2  Green 3  Cyan 4  Red 5  Magenta 6  Brown 7  White 8  Gray9  Intense blue A  Intense green B  Intense cyan C  Intense red D  Intensemagenta E  Yellow F  Intense whiteandM;Cut CompuServe CostsandM;I enjoy using CompuServe, but I find I'm running up more of a bill each monththan I can really afford.andP;  Do you have any recommendations for cutting mycosts? Ferry Katz Dayton, OhioandM;The best suggestion is to take advantage of CompuServe's free Practice Forum.andO;You're not charged for access time while you're in that forum, and a coupleof hours learning the ins and outs of CompuServe's commands and menus willpay off handsomely.andP;  It's also the best place to go if you need to make minoronline adjustments to your communications software.andM;You can save time by using CompuServe's command mode instead of menus, whicheat up time displaying themselves.andP;  If you have a hard time remembering thecommands, use communications software such as Crosstalk that allows you toprogram your function keys with the most common commands.andP;  And scripts, whichautomate responses to online prompts, can be created in many communicationsprograms to do all your responding for you.andM;Look for CompuServe shortcuts such as the command Receive, which retrievesand displays messages waiting in your EasyPlex mailbox, bypassing normal menunavigation.andP;  Be sure to capture all mail messages to files, read themoffline, and write your replies before you log back on.andP;  Finally, check outspecialized CompuServe communications programs, such as Tapcis.andM;Challenge SolvedandM;The October Challenge came from Brad Longshaw, who wanted to know why Lotus1-2-3 kept dropping him back to DOS.andP;  His 1-2-3 had worked on his Compaq foryears, and it continued to work when Brad transferred it to other PCs.andM;Several replies we got from readers with similar problems pointed to the samesolution: an incompatibility between 1-2-3 and the version of DOS Brad wasusing.andP;  At our suggestion, he upgraded from DOS 3.2 to 3.3.andP;  The problemdisappeared.andM;Brad's thanks and $50 from us go to William F. Linne of Vacaville,California, who was the first to suggest ths solution.andP;  Other readers whoalso came up with the same fix will get a PC/Computing T-shirt.andM;ChallengeandM;I have stumbled across some strange incompatbility between DOS 3.3 and a3-1/2-inch 720K B: drive on my Tandy 1000SX.andP;  Lately, when I format a disk,it is formatted to a capacity of only 360K, not 720K.andP;  Yet I had used thedrive for several months with DOS 3.2 and had experienced no problems.andP;  Infact, if I reboot the machine with DOS 3.2, it still formats 3-1/2-inch disksto 720K.andP;  Do you have any idea what could be wrong? Willie C. White Carson,CaliforniaandM;Normally, DOS determines the capacity of a drive during startup and formatsfloppies to the maximum capacity unless told to do otherwise.andP;  Positivelyidentifying a drive can be tricky business, so it's not hard to believe thatevery now and then DOS might slip up and mistake a low-density 3-1/2-inchdrive for a low-density 5-1/4-inch drive.andP;  But it sure doesn't seem as if DOS3.3 should fail when 3.2 doesn't.andP;  There must be more to it than the version.andM;If you can help Willie figure out what's happening with his drive, drop aletter to &quot;March Challenge&quot; describing the cure.andP;  If we publish yoursolution, we'll convey our thanks by sending you a check for $50 and aPC/Computing T-shirt.andP;  Be sure to include your shirt size: S, M, L, or XL.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
