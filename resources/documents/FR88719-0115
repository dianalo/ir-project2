L. 95-604, the ``Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation ControlAct of 1978,'' enacted on November 8, 1978.  </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUMMARY: </T2>The ``Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of1978'' (UMTRCA or the Act) authorized the Department of Energy (DOE orthe Department) to conduct, in cooperation with interested states, IndianTribes, and persons who own or control certain inactive mill tailings sites,a program of assessment and remedial action to stabilize and control thetailings in a safe and environmentally sound manner and to minimize oreliminate radiation health hazards at these sites and at nearby vicinityproperties. The DOE has been requested by the Hecla Mining Company (Hecla) to includeHecla's ``Durita'' property as a designated property for the purposes ofremedial action under the Act. The ``Durita'' property is located approximatelynine miles west of Naturita off Colorado Highway 90S. On April 28, 1988, DOE published a notice in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> in which it proposed not to include the ``Durita''property as either a production site or vicinity property for the purposesof remedial action under the Act. 53 FR 15273. The purpose of the noticewas to solicit comments on DOE's proposed decision. Accordingly, commentswere received from the State of Colorado (letter from the Office of theAttorney General, dated June 16, 1988, hereafter State Comments) and theHecla Mining Company (Comments and Objections of Hecla Mining Company byDavis, Graham andamp; Stubbs, Denver, Colorado, dated June 3, 1988, hereafterHecla Comments). As set forth below, after considering the comments, theDepartment has decided that the ``Durita'' property is not a proper candidatefor inclusion in the remedial action program under UMTRCA. <ITAG tagnum="84">Background </ITAG>The ``Uranium Mill Tailings Radiation Control Act of 1978,'' Pub. L. 95-604,42 U.S.C. 7901, <T3>et seq., </T3>establishes a program to provide for the stabilization,disposal, and control of uranium mill tailings in a safe and environmentallysound manner. Under Title I of the Act, the DOE is authorized to conductremedial actions at certain inactive processing sites. Section 101(6) of the Act defines two types of ``processing sites.'' Thefirst is an inactive ``production site'' defined as:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) any site, including the mill containing residual radiocative materialsat which all or substantially all of the uranium was produced for saleto any Federal agency prior to January 1, 1971 under a contract with anyFederal agency, * * * unless (i) such site was owned or controlled as ofJanuary 1, 1978, or is thereafter owned or controlled, by any Federal agency,or (ii) a license (issued by the [Nuclear Regulatory] Commission or itspredecessor agency under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 or by a State aspermitted under section 274 of such Act) for the production at such siteof any uranium or thorium product derived from ores is in effect on January1, 1978, or is issued or renewed after such date. The second type is a``vicinity property'' defined as: ``(B) any other real property or improvementthereon which_(i) is in the vicinity of such [production] site, and (ii)is determined by the Secretary, in consultation with the Commission, tobe contaminated with residual radioactive materials derived from such site.</ITAG>Section 101(7) of the Act defines the term ``residual radioactive material''to mean:<ITAG tagnum="21">(A) waste (which the Secretary determines to be radioactive) in theform of tailings resulting from the processing of ores for the extractionof uranium and other valuable constitutents of the ores, and (B) otherwaste (which the Secretary determines to be radioactive) at a processingsite which relate (sic) to such processing, including any residual stockof unprocessed ores or low-grade materials.</ITAG>Furthermore, section 101(8) of the Act defines ``tailings'' to mean:<ITAG tagnum="21">The remaining portion of a metal-bearing ore after some or all ofsuch metal, such as uranium, has been extracted. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion </ITAG>Before the passage of UMTRCA on November 8, 1978, Ranchers Explorationandamp; Development Corporation (Ranchers), the predecessor-in-interest tothe Hecla Mining Company, owned and controlled a quantity of uranium milltailings at a site known as ``Naturita,'' a previously active mill sitealso near Naturita, Colorado. Ranchers possessed the tailings under licenseColo. 317-01S, issued on November 12, 1976, by the State of Colorado. OnJune 9, 1977, a new state license, Colo. 317-02S, was issued supersedingthe previous license and permitting Ranchers to ``transport and process''uranium mill tailings. Amendments 1 (October 26, 1977), 2 (December 12,1977), and 3 (May 4, 1978) modify the license to authorize the excavationand transportation of uranium mill tailings from the old Naturita millsite to the new ``Durita'' processing site for the ``production of naturaluranium concentrate by leaching of uranium mill tailings.'' It is the Department's view that the ``Durita'' site was operating as anactive mill site under a valid state production license at the time UMTRCAwas enacted, and that the site does not fit within the definition of aninactive ``production site'' under section 101(6)(A) of the Act as a siteappropriate for remedial action because the uranium produced there wasnot produced for sale to any Federal agency prior to January 1, 1971.Furthermore, with respect to such ``[a]ctive operations'' at the time ofthe Act's passage, Congress in section 115(a) has prohibited expenditureswith respect to any site licensed by a state at which production of anyuranium product takes place. It was Congress' intent that remedial actionat licensed active mill sites be taken by the license holder pursuant tothe license requirements under the supervision of the regulating agency,and not be taken under UMTRCA at taxpayer expense. In addition, because ``Durita'' was a licensed active mill site, it doesnot fit within the definition of a vicinity property under section 101(6)(B).Any remaining materials at the ``Durita'' mill site are ``derived'' fromthe active production operation itself rather than from the inactive Naturitamill site. Once the uranium mill tailings were excavated and transportedfrom the Naturita mill site to ``Durita'' for processing, they lost theircharacteristic as ``residual radioactive materials.'' As set out above,that term means ``waste in the form of tailings.'' Although the materialstaken from the Naturita mill site to the ``Durita'' mill site were tailings,they were not ``waste,'' since they were transported as a valuable industrialproduct for use in a profit making venture, i.e., the production of uraniumfor sale as yellow cake to private industry. Indeed, in 1978 and 1979,Ranchers had revenues of $8,841,737 and $12,491,067, respectively, fromthe leaching of uranium mill tailings. The inclusion of ``Durita'' as avicinity property would thus seem contrary to Congress' intent that suchvicinity properties not have been active mill sites themselves at the timeof UMTRCA's passage. Even assuming that the materials at the ``Durita'' mill site qualify asresidual radioactive material derived from the Naturita site which Rancherswas processing under license Colo. 317-02S for sale to a Federal agency,the site would still not be appropriate for designation. Section 101(6)(A)(ii)precludes designation where a license, issued by a state for the productionof any uranium product from ores, is in effect on January 1, 1978. However,in the stipulation following section 101(6)(B)(ii) and pursuant to theprocedures established in section 108(b), an exemption is provided wherea license is issued for the reprocessing of residual radioactive materials(mill tailings) at a designated site. In this case, the uranium productionat the ``Durita'' mill site using mill tailings from the Naturita sitewas undertaken prior to the designation of Naturita as a ``processing site.''Moreover, since neither Ranchers nor Hecla took any action to meet therequirements of section 108(b) after Naturita's designation, in the Department'sview the exception would not apply. DOE has given full and deliberative consideration to comments and objectionsto its Proposed Decision, and our responses to specific comments are setout below. These comments were instrumental in DOE's formulation of a finaldecision regarding whether to include the ``Durita'' property in the UMTRCAremedial action program. Accordingly, DOE has determined that the ``Durita''property is neither a production site nor a vicinity property within thedefinition of a processing site under UMTRCA, and therefore is not appropriatefor remedial action under the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">Response To Comments </ITAG>In its comments and objections to DOE's proposed decision, Hecla responds:<ITAG tagnum="21">[DOE's] rationale miscontrues the basic intent of Congress in enactingUMTRCA. Congress clearly directed DOE to perform remedial action on ``residualradioactive material'' (i.e., uranium tailings) that had been generatedas a result of federally-induced uranium production programs in the periodbefore 1971.''</ITAG>Hecla Comments, page 4. Hecla asserts that relocating and reporcessing tailings from another site,one which qualifies for remedial action, should not change the government'sobligation to perform remedial action at the new site, i.e., the Duritasite.<T3> Id</T3>. at 5. These comments exemplify the value of the notice and comment procedureadopted by DOE in this instance, because they succinctly identify the sourceof Hecla's basic misunderstanding of the statute authorizing DOE to takeremedial action. Contrary to Hecla's belief, Congress did not direct DOEsimply to perform remedial action on ``residual radioactive material'',but to perform remedial action<T3> at qualified sites</T3>. Indeed, the Act instructs the Secretary todesignate ``processing sites within the United States which he determinesrequires (sic) remedial action to carry out the purposes of [Title I].''42 U.S.C. 7901(b)(1) and 7912(a)(1). This determination is to be made againstcertain criteria set out in the Act. In the present case, the Secretaryhas determined that the designation of the Durita site would not carryout the purposes of the Act. In general, it is the Department's positionthat UMTRCA's purpose is to cleanup<T3> sites </T3>contaminated as a result of the production of uranium soldto the government. Durita is not such a site. Contrary to what appearsto be Hecla's understanding, UMTRCA does not encompass the cleanup of allresidual radioactive material at any location irrespective of the reasonsthe material came to be present at such location. One of the criteria established in Title I for designating a site is thatthe candidate processing site be one ``at which all or substantially allof the uranium was produced for sale to any Federal agency prior to January1, 1971, under a contract with any Federal agency.'' 42 U.S.C. 7911(6)(A).The Durita property was not such a site since neither Hecla nor its predecessorproduced uranium there for sale to a Federal agency before 1971. Indeed,the Durita property was only utilized to produce uranium to private industryafter 1971. DOE's reading of the Act is consistent with the legislativehistory. For example, the House Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs,in discussing the characteristics of the sites deemed appropriate for remedialaction under UMTRCA, stated that ``[a]ll of them consist of tailings resultingfrom operations under Federal contracts,'' and that ``the Secretary ofEnergy need not designate any sites to be included in the authorized programwhich are currently under active license, or which contain tailings fromcommercial production, unless it can be shown that the tailings hazardcould in no way be remedied without such designation.'' H.R. Rep. No. 95-1480(I),August 11, 1978,<T3> reprinted in</T3> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Ad. News 7433, 7434-36.Based on this analysis, it is the Department's view that once Hecla relocatedand reprocessed the tailings from the Naturita site, it created a new site,one which does not meet the basic requirement of the Act, i.e., that asite qualified for remedial action under UMTRCA be one at which uraniumwas produced for sale to a federal agency prior to January 1, 1971.Hecla submitted a number of comments addressing the ``licensed site exemption.''Hecla Comments, pp. 5-9. This exemption is a proviso in section 101(6)(A)(ii).It forecloses designation of a site containing residual radioactive materialswhich is licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) or an agreementstate on or after January 1, 1978. Durita is such a site, and DOE set outthis exemption as an additional basis on which Durita would not qualifyfor remedial action.First, Hecla submits that section 115's prohibition on the expenditureof UMTRCA funds on licensed sites does not apply to uranium productionfrom residual radioactive materials. This miscontrues the statute. Whilesection 115, on its face, appears to provide an exception for residualradioactive materials, a reading of this section in light of section 101(6)and the purpose of the statute leads DOE to conclude that Congress' intentwas that the only active licensed sites containing residual radioactivematerial that are appropriate for remediation are ones complying with theprovisions of section 108(b). This conclusion follows from a reading ofthe last sentence of section 101(6): ``A license for the production ofany uranium product from residual radioactive materials shall not be treatedas a license for production from ores within the meaning of subparagraph(A)(ii) if such production is in accordance with section 108(b).'' Hecladid not comply with the stipulations contained in section 108(b) for itsDurita remilling operation.Hecla also states that ``Congress logically concluded that activities involvingreprocessing of uranium tailings should not trigger the `licensed site'exemption, because such reprocessing neither increases the government'scleanup burden nor alters the fact that the tailings meet Title I criteria.''Hecla Comments, p. 6. This view ignores that Hecla has created an entirelynew site at Durita which it has contaminated with radioactive materials,and which did not operate to produce uranium for any federal agency. Takento its logical end, Hecla would have DOE, at taxpayer expense, cleanupafter it in the wake of Hecla's industrial ventures at whatever sites itchooses to operate from. We do not believe the Act authorizes this.Hecla further argues that the Durita site does not meet the licensed siteexemption since its license was not issued pursuant to Section 274 of theAtomic Energy Act (AEA) because the NRC did not have authority to delegatelicensing of byproduct material to the States. Hecla Comments at p. 7.This argument fails to recognize the interrelation of the AEA and UMTRCA.Statutorily, a license within this particular exemption must be issuedby the appropriate federal agency or by a State ``<T3>as permitted</T3> under section 274 of the Act [42 USCS 2021].'' 42USCS 7911(6)(A)(1) (emphasis added). While the NRC did not have licensingauthority over byproduct material until 1981, a State may have enteredinto an agreement with respect to byproduct material prior to 1981 ``<T3>as permitted</T3> under section 274 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954''.42 USCS 2021(h)(1), (2) (emphasis added). <T3>See also, </T3>10 CFR 150.31(a). Thus, it is our position that Hecla'slicense with the State of Colorado was issued <T3>``as permitted''</T3> under section 274 of the AEA. In any event, Hecla'sargument here is specious. The licensed site exemption only applies withrespect to sites containing residual radioactive materials at which uraniumwas produced for sale to a federal agency prior to 1971. Durita, as notedearlier, is not such a site.Hecla also disagrees that the prohibition of section 101(6)(A)(ii) appliesto ``tailings'', since the word used in that exemption is ``ores''. <T3>Id</T3>., p. 7. The Department has determined that the word ores shouldbe read to encompass tailings which are reprocessed to extract their uraniumvalue. This is consistent with one definition of ores: ``a source fromwhich a valuable matter is extracted.'' Webster's Ninth New CollegiateDictionary at 831 (1983). This is also consistent with the stipulationfollowing section 101(6)(B)(ii) which, the Department believes, allowsthe Secretary to treat a license for the production of uranium from residualradioactive material, including tailings, as a license for the productionof uranium from ores.Finally, Hecla asserts that the final sentence of section 108(b) ``createsan uncertainty as to whether issuance of such a license to satisfy section108(b) would alter the Title I status of a given site,'' and that the finalsentence of section 101(6) clarifies that ``such licenses would not alterthat site's Title I status.'' <T3>Id.,</T3> p. 8. We agree that the final sentence of section 101(6)makes clear that remilling pursuant to section 108(b) would not fall withinthe licensed site exemption. But Hecla's private remilling operation wasnot conducted or licensed pursuant to section 108(b), and the Act is silentas to these other types of licensed operations. Hecla argues that thissilence does not imply that ``any post-UMTRCA reprocessing of residualradioactive material which is not in accordance with section 108(b) automaticallytriggers the definitional exception in section 101(6)(A)(ii).'' Hecla Comments,p. 8. No support for this statement is put forward, and the Departmentis aware of none. As discussed above, it is the Department's view thatthe licensed site exemption would apply to an operation such as Hecla'sremilling at Durita. However, the exemption could not arise in any eventsince it only applies to sites at which uranium was produced for sale toa federal agency. It is undisputed that this was not the case with Durita'suranium reprocessing operation.It is Hecla's position that its Durita site further qualifies as a vicinityproperty under UMTRCA. It states that ``reprocessing of the tailings didnot change their basic physical characteristic as Title I material.'' HeclaComments, p. 9. This again points up Hecla's basic misunderstanding ofthe Act. The residual radioactive material at Naturita derived its ``characteristicas Title I material'' because of its presence at a Title I designated productionsite, not simply because the material itself was ``Title I.'' Thus, itis a site qualified for designation under UMTRCA which defines the material,not vice versa. An otherwise non-qualifying and active licensed productionsite cannot qualify for remedial action under UMTRCA simply because itsuranium resource base is material from a Title I inactive production site.Hecla seeks to qualify its Durita production site as a vicinity propertyby asserting that its use of residual radioactive material for the extractionof uranium is no different than other private users of tailings in buildingmaterials, fill material and other profit-making ways. <T3>Id.,</T3> p. 10. But these other uses utilized the tailings as a wasteproduct suited to those particular activities, i.e., generally foundationmaterial. Hecla, on the other hand, utilized the tailings for their inherentcommercial value as a uranium resource for its remilling business. Theformer uses were unregulated and unlicensed because the material was generallythought to be harmless. Hecla's operation, on the other hand, was regulatedby the State, and it required a license under which Hecla is to take remedialaction, action which Congress said should not be taken under UMTRCA. H.R.Rep. 95-1480(I), <T3>supra.</T3> It is not tenable, in the view of DOE, to assert that thesesituations are the same. Indeed, Congress, in describing the characteristicsof vicinity properties, referred to ``structures and buildings locatedin the vicinity of such site which are contaminated with residual radioactivematerials derived from such site.'' House Report No. 95-1480 (II), September30, 1978, <T3>reprinted in</T3> 1978 U.S. Code Cong. andamp; Ad. News 7462. The Duritaproperty is not such a structure or building.The State of Colorado, after reviewing the Notice of Proposed Decision,states that ``we are in agreement with the proposed decision to excludethe Durita property from remedial action under UMTRCA for the reasons statedin the Notice.''
