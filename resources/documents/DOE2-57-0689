Besides, permittivity,static and dynamic nonlinearity have been investiagted at 0.5 GHz frequency(in the 4.2-300 K temperature range). Dielectric properties of K/sub1-x/Li/sub x/TaO/sub 3/ are simultaneously determined by the relaxationof impurity ions and a soft mode, and the contribution of the soft modeinto {epsilon} at helium temperatures dominates. Lithium addition leadsto decrease the {epsilon} values at 4.2 K and the reduction of {epsilon}(T)dependence slope. KTaO/sub 3/ crystals doped with lithium revealed exclusivelysmall losses in helium (at 4.2 K in the 12-14 GHz range tg{delta}=2x10/sub-5/ for all x=0.1). When temperatures increase, the losses increase similarlyto pure KTaO/sub 3/, although not so sharply. Measurements in crystalswith x=0.1 have shown the noticeable dispersion of nonlinearity: thecoefficient of static nonlinearity is by an order greater than the coefficientof dynamic nonlinearity {alpha}/sub 1//sup dyn/, which is determinedaccording to the efficiency of the second harmonics generation.</TEXT></DOC>
