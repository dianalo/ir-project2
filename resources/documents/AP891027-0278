ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Wall Street was stunned. Bond brokers froze.Doomsayers talked of financial disaster.   That was the scene a year ago, as the biggest takeover battle ofall time consumed RJR Nabisco Inc. When it was over, the investmentfirm Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co. had defeated the food andtobacco giant's top management, paid a record $24.53 billion inborrowed money and put the company heavily into debt.   Critics of the 1980s takeover era said RJR Nabisco would becrushed by the weight of its debt load and jeopardize the banksthat financed the deal. The bond market, already reeling from arash of high-priced takeovers, was traumatized because investorsthought the buyout binge had gone too far.   What a difference a year makes.   Despite a debt of $23 billion, RJR Nabisco now is seen as arelative rock of stability while the financial markets are buffetedwith uncertainty raised by smaller takeovers.   ``I think the company is doing tremendously well,'' said KurtFeuerman, a securities analayst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   Jack Maxwell of Wheat First Securities in Richmond, Va., said,``It's a good company and they've got a good team.''   Investors also praise the new RJR Nabisco. Confidence in thecompany was evident in the recent performance of the company'shigh-yield ``junk bonds'' that were used to finance the takeover.Prices skidded on the high-yield market after other big buyouts raninto trouble recently. RJR Nabisco's didn't.   There are two reasons why.   Because of the nature of RJR Nabisco's business, the company isconsidered inherently more stable than other companies. Investorsalso have confidence in its management.   The biggest worry for highly leveraged companies like RJRNabisco is cash flow _ without a strong, steady influx of money,they can't pay their interest bills.   Several buyouts have stumbled because cash flow hasn't matchedprojections. The most notorious case has been Campeau Corp.'s $6.6billion takeover of Federated Department Stores Inc., a wobblytransaction that jolted the stock and bond markets a few weeks agobecause Campeau couldn't pay its interest.   Kohlberg Kravis, the acknowledged leader of debt-financedtakeovers, played no role in the Campeau-Federated problem, butsome of its financial deals have faced difficulty. For example, its$360 million buyout of Seaman Furniture Co., had to be refinanced.   No one expects that to happen at RJR Nabisco, because thecompany's products are considered ``recession proof'' _ even inhard times, people would still eat Oreos and smoke Camels.   ``They have a predictable cash flow generating capability whichexceeds interest expense and capital expense,'' said MichaelDahood, a bond market analyst. ``The stability of the enterprise isnot threatened by debt expense.''   The company's R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. _ along with othertobacco firms _ has lost market share to industry leader PhilipMorris Cos. Inc. in recent years, but the analysts see little causefor concern.   ``Tobacco profits should grow 15 percent his year and another 20percent next year,'' said Drexel's Feuerman, noting that profitgrowth from overseas sales is also in the range of 20 percent.   Analysts and investors say they're satisfied with the way RJRNabisco Chairman Louis Gerstner has handled the company since hearrived there from American Express Co. eight months ago.   They particularly like the prices he's gotten for assets RJRNabisco has sold to help repay its debt load.   The company has sold five European food businesses for $2.5billion; its Chun King division for $52 million; its AssociatedBiscuits International Ltd. for $44 million; Del Monte fresh fruitoperations for $875 million; Del Monte's canned food business for$1.48 billion; and most recently, its Baby Ruth, Butterfinger andPearson candy businesses for $370 million.   The sold divisions won't cost RJR Nabisco that much business and``what they have left is very strongly positioned,'' Feuerman said.   RJR Nabisco must still dispose of some $230 million in assets toreach its goal of $5.5 billion in divestitures. ``There are somesmaller parts of the company that we're exploring at this point,''but the company does not plan to shed any major divisions, Gerstnersaid in an interview.   Individual product lines are the most likely to go.   Maxwell, the Wheat First analyst, said he was pleased by costand inventory reductions and by the company's plans for boostingtobacco sales. In recent years, R.J. Reynolds has turned around itsonce-lagging Camel brand, and is focusing on revitalizing Winstonand Salem sales, Maxwell said.   The battle for RJR Nabisco marked a quantum leap in the scope ofthe takeover trend reshaping American business. For the first time,it seemed to raise the possibility that any company could beacquired with borrowed money.   The company announced on Oct. 20 that its chief executive, F.Ross Johnson, was considering a bid of about $17 billion.   That kind of money was beyond comprehension on Wall Street. Butfour days later, Kohlberg Kravis announced a $20.25 billion offer,signaling the start of a bidding war that for a while included theinvestment firm First Boston Corp.   The RJR Nabisco fight not only dwarfed all records fortakeovers, it came against a background of brawls for two other bigfood companies.   Just days before, Philip Morris had launched an $11 billionoffer for Kraft Inc. and Pillsbury Co. had rejected a $5.23 billionbid from the British firm Grand Metropolitan PLC.   In both cases the suitors won. And late in the evening of Nov.29, RJR Nabisco announced that Kohlberg Kravis had emerged thewinner.   Johnson was vanquished but still rich from a severance packageand the sale of his own RJR Nabisco stock when he resigned in earlyFebruary. He took several top RJR Nabisco managers with him, butanalysts said they were satisfied with Gerstner's replacements.   Kohlberg Kravis is also said to be happy with RJR Nabisco'sperformance. The investment firm is smarting from Seaman's problemsand reports that it has been disappointed by other investments, andits reputation rests on the outcome of its biggest takeover.   For Gerstner, the outside world's obsession with the size of thetakeover is irrelevant. It's running the business that's mostimportant.   ``You've got to separate that financial transaction from thegreat marketing strength and production strength of this company,''he said.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday Oct. 29</NOTE></DOC>
