The drug, adenosine, was developed for use in diagnosingheart disease by Medco Research Inc., a pharmaceuticalresearch and development company based in Los Angeles.Following its usual practice Medco licensed a major drugcompany, Fujisawa of Japan, to market the drug.</LP><TEXT>   Fujisawa's U.S. subsidiary in Deerfield, Ill., is awaitingapproval of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to marketadenosine under the name, Adenoscan, John Wishnant, medicaldirector of the subsidiary, said. Fujisawa already sellsadenosine, as Adenocar, under a Medco license but only forthe treatment of a certain type of irregular heart beat.   Adenosine occurs naturally in heart muscle where it isreleased in tiny amounts to protect against overwork,explained Luiz Belardinelli, a University of Floridainternist and pharmacologist who began investigatingadenosine's effects on the heart several years ago. Wheneverthe heart muscle isn't getting enough oxygen, additionaladenosine is released. The adenosine has several protectiveeffects, one of which is to open the coronary arteries,increasing the supply of oxygen-rich blood, Dr. Belardinelliexplained at a Fujisawa-sponsored news conference. Dr.Belardinelli was co-chairman of a symposium on adenosine atthe AHA meeting.   The treadmill exercise test is aimed at doing the samething, that is, boosting the flow of blood through thecoronary arteries. When a physician suspects that a patienthas coronary arteries that are blocked by fatty deposits, heoften will have the patient undergo a &quot;thallium scan.&quot; Thepatient exercises on a treadmill for several minutes duringwhich he or she is given an injection of radioactivethallium. A detector or an imaging machine that traces thethallium through the arteries can pinpoint impeded bloodflow, indicating the existence of a fatty deposit.   But almost a third of the patients referred for suchdiagnostic testing are unable to run on a treadmill and manyothers tire before they reach the maximum heart rates,explained cardiologist Mario S. Verani of the Baylor Collegeof Medicine in Houston. In the latter group, the treadmilltest reveals clogged coronary arteries in only about 75% ofpatients who have such coronary heart disease, he said.   Dr. Verani said that for several years doctors have usedblood vessel dilating drugs in patients unable to run on thetreadmill. The most common is dipyridamole, which causesheart muscle cells to release adenosine, the researcherssaid.   Many heart diagnostic researchers are finding itpreferable to give adenosine directly instead ofdipyridamole, said Adbulmassih S. Iskandrian, director ofcardiac imaging at the Philadelphia Heart Institute. Thedrug, infused intravenously for about six minutes during thethallium scan, works faster and disappears from thebloodstream within seconds after the infusion stops, thusminimizing such side effects as headache, stomach pain andshortness of breath -- &quot;the same as the side effects ofexercise,&quot; he said.   Dr. Verani said adenosine enabled the thallium scan todetect 90% of clogged coronary arteries, about the same astreadmill tests reveal in patients who attain maximum heartrate during the exercise.   About 40% of the patients referred to his clinic forcardiac imaging are given adenosine as a substitute for thetreadmill, Dr. Iskandrian said. He cited, as examples of suchpatients, an 83-year-old grandmother who had two artificialhips, and a surgeon who had a ballooning -- or aneurysm -- ofhis major artery.   More than 5,000 people had taken the adenosine-aided testand &quot;no patient has died from the test,&quot; Dr. Iskandrian said.</TEXT></DOC>
