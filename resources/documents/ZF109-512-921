(AmEx TRS) is expected onOct. 15 to begin installing an automated purchasing system designed to cutbuying costs and change the way all 105 TRS buyers do business.andM;The buyers, who work for TRS, purchase necessary supplies, such as envelopes,business cards and stationery, from 4,000 to 5,000 vendors.andP;  The supplies areused for, among other things, charge-card customer mailings.andM;AmEx TRS's new Pc-based LAN purchasing system, called the PurchasingInformation Decision Support System, makes use of Windows 3.0's graphicaluser interface.andP;  It is projected to reduce overall yearly buying costs forAmEx's direct-mail business, said Michael Valentini, director of finance,systems and analysis for TRS's purchasing department.andP;  &quot;We will be cuttingone-half of 1 percent off our purchasing-dollar activity,&quot; said Valentini,&quot;and we think that's a conservative figure.&quot;andM;The system is designed to give buyers the tools not only for purchasing, butalso to do project tracking and analysis, which will, for example, allow AmExbuyers to look at past purchases for AmEx's direct-mail business online.andO;This will improve efficiency and reduce buying costs and errors, explainedGeorge Roukas, director of business-systems analysis for TRS's technologiesdepartment.andP;  AmEx would not disclose the cost of the new system.andM;What makes this system unique is that it is a purchasing system geared towardthe retail business, said Roukas.andP;  Most purchasing systems are designed formanufacturing operations, he added.andM;TRS does about $350 million in purchasing-dollar volume each year, saidValentini.andP;  TRS also annually processes some 20,000 purchase orders with50,000 requests for items, he said.andM;With more than 20 million cardmembers, AmEx processes more than 20 millionmonthly billing statements.andP;  To mail billing statements, AmEx must purchasemore than 20 million envelopes a month--a buying process with many layers,said Roukas.andM;The new Purchasing Information Decision Support System is designed to &quot;getinformation to the buyers to improve their purchasing process and givemanagement information to evaluate how individual buyers are doing theirpurchasing,&quot; said William Cornfield, president of the Windows Support Group(WSG) in New York and a consultant for AmEx on the project.andM;Before the PC-based system, the AmEx purchasing department used a Wangcentral data network.andP;  Buyers used a paper-based system, explained PaulScanlon, manager of finance, systems and analysis for TRS's purchasingdepartment.andP;  In fact, prior to January 1988, AmEx TRS had only one installedPC, Scanlon said.andP;  Then the firm installed two IBM ATs.andM;With the new system in place, AmEx's purchasing department will have 70Compaq Deskpro 386 workstations running DOS on an IBM Token-Ring networkrunning 3Com's 3+ version 2.0 in the New York headquarters, and five to 11workstations in six field locations.andM;&quot;We're looking at how to tie them together,&quot; said Roukas, with options thatinclude installing bridges and routers around a Systems Network Architecturebackbone, he added.andM;The new system also will run OS/2 1.21 on the network file server.andP;  That OS/2version runs well with Compaq machines, said Cornfield, though he would notcomment on whether the system will eventually move to OS/2.andM;Buying Windows was a key decision for AmEx, said WSG's Cornfield, because itwas important that the operating system have an open interface with othersystems.andM;According to Scanlon, AmEx chose Microsoft's SQL Server because it offers,among other things, tools to enforce referential integrity.andM;The referential-integrity feature was particularly important to AmEx, as itensures that relationships between tables are consistent, said Roukas, addingthat AmEx liked SQL Server because the server itself is programmable and canenforce referential integrity and data security.andM;&quot;Data security was most important,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;The server becomes thegatekeeper--it enforces all security.&quot;andM;All training and support will be done inhouse.andP;  WSG is now training AmExtrainers to use the system, said WSG's Cornfield.andM;The firm expects to see a return on its investment by 1992, said Valentini.andO;Future plans include possibly interfacing the new system with accountspayable, he said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
