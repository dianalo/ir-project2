While the Big Board is a long way from being open 24 hoursa day, exchange officials think that two electronicafter-hours trading sessions set to start June 13 will makebig customers want to bring their business back to the U.S.,luring more than 15 million shares that trade every dayoverseas and on regional exchanges.</LP><TEXT>   But what does it mean for the average investor? Here areanswers to some questions raised by the Big Board's expansionof trading hours.                                                                                                          Will I be able to trade stocks after 4 p.m.?   Yes. Individuals and institutional investors alike willhave access to all Big Board stocks through a computer thatmatches buyers and sellers. One trading session will acceptorders for 45 minutes starting at 4:15 p.m. Eastern time, 15minutes after the traditional closing bell. A second session,which will run from 4 p.m. to 5:15 p.m., will be reserved forbig program traders to execute trades involving baskets ofstocks.   As with any other trade, a small investor will placeorders through his broker. But there are several rules:First, the buy or sell order can't be executed unless anorder for the other side of the trade also is entered intothe system. Second, the investors must be willing to trade atthe exact 4 p.m. closing price -- no more, no less.   For example, if at 4:20 p.m. General Motors Corp. lookslike a bargain at its closing price of $37 a share, aninvestor can place an order to buy 500 shares with his brokerat that price. If there is a similar order from anotherinvestor to sell 500 GM shares, a match would occur. At 5p.m., the Big Board computer would execute all the pairedorders, and confirmation would come back to the brokers whoentered the transactions. Orders entered before 4 p.m., butnot executed during the regular trading session, can also bepart of the system.                                                                                                          What happens if my trade doesn't match up?   It won't be executed. The earliest entries will get thefirst priority to be matched up, so that if there are bids tobuy 10,000 shares of GM and offers to sell 1,000 shares, onlythe first 1,000 shares will be traded, and the offers for theother 9,000 shares will expire.   But brokers won't get commissions for unmatched orders, soWall Street firms are expected to pre-match client orders.That gives those orders priority, with any pre-matched orderautomatically executed at 5 p.m. by the stock exchange.                                                                                                          Can I do small trades of, say, 25 or 50 shares, aso-called odd lot? Is there a minimum or maximum number ofshares I must trade?   Odd lots will be executed only if they are part of apre-matched trade. Round lots, typically orders in incrementsof 100 shares, can come into the computer unmatched and lookfor partners. Unmatched orders must be round lots of at least100 shares, and the maximum size order is 99,900 shares.                                                                                                          Why is trading being done only at a fixed price?   The Big Board says that's where it saw the demand for itsservices. Most off-exchange &quot;crossing networks&quot; that competewith the Big Board don't allow prices to fluctuate, and theNew York exchange didn't want to create an after-hoursauction.   If two investors agree to a price that is above or belowthe closing price of the stock on the Big Board, they (ormore likely their broker) will have to take the tradeoverseas to complete it.                                                                                                          What's all this talk about basket trades after 4 p.m.? Andwhat does it mean to me?   Basket trades are a main reason the Big Board is gettinginto this after-hours game. The second trading session,between 4 p.m. and 5:15 p.m., will be exclusively the domainof large investors who want to buy or sell baskets of atleast 15 different NYSE-listed stocks with a market value of$1 million or more.   Large investors often take their trades to London, wherethey can trade cheaply and with more anonymity than in NewYork. But the Big Board wants their business back, so it hasset aside a session just for them -- and has convinced theSecurities and Exchange Commission that for a limited time itshould waive government trading fees for these programtrades.   Those basket trades shouldn't affect individual investorsmuch. They could change stock prices a bit (as they do now inLondon), but when the Big Board opens in the morning, theprevious day's closing prices will be the starting point.   However, in order to give program traders the anonymitythey have in Europe, the exchange will report only twoaggregate numbers for trading volume and dollar amount at theend of each session. Program traders won't have to providedetails of their trades, including prices, for three days.                                                                                                          Will other U.S. exchanges also have later hours?   Some already do, and others are planning them. The PacificStock Exchange in San Francisco, for example, is open fortrading until 4:30 p.m. Eastern time and may extend thatfurther. The National Association of Securities Dealers,which runs the Nasdaq over-the-counter market, is awaitingSEC approval to open trading at 3:30 a.m. Eastern time, whenthe London stock exchange opens. It would trade 400 to 500stocks until 9 a.m. that same morning. Also, the PhiladelphiaStock Exchange recently proposed two after-hours tradingsessions that replicate the Big Board's.   &quot;We don't see any great need for after-hours trading,&quot;says Roger Hendrick, an official at the Midwest StockExchange in Chicago. Nevertheless, the exchange is seekingthe right to do trades in any stock when it trades afterhours on the Big Board.   The American Stock Exchange says it has the grandest plansof all. It is working with the Chicago Board Options Exchangeand Reuters Holdings PLC on a plan to trade stocks andoptions continuously -- not just for an extra hour or two.&quot;We're going for the full 24-hour trading. We're not doingwhat the NYSE is, with step-by-step,&quot; says an Amexspokeswoman. But these exchanges haven't gotten to the stageof seeking SEC approval.                                                                                                          Will the Big Board's plans force brokers to work longer?   It's too early to tell, but probably not. Officials atMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. and Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., thetwo biggest U.S. brokerage firms, say the Big Board's newsessions probably will be a &quot;non-event&quot; as far as theirindividual-investor operations are concerned. These firmsalready accommodate large customers who want to trade offhours, and they have no plans to beef up after-hoursstaffing.                                                                                                          How much trading volume is anticipated in the Big Boardafter-hours sessions?   That's the multimillion-dollar question. The exchangehopes it will recapture most of the 15 million or more sharesin daily trading that have drifted overseas and to otherexchanges. But the Big Board's limited extension of tradinghours will certainly hold down volume. Some traders say theylike to buy or sell stocks in the morning before the BigBoard opens. Until the exchange expands its hours further, itwon't capture that business.                                                                                                          Will any of this change the closing stock prices I read inthe newspaper?   Sometimes. Currently, you see composite closing prices,which list the latest U.S. transaction for each Big Boardstock -- including any activity on a regional exchange ifthat trade takes place after the New York Stock Exchangeclose.   Under the new system, all after-hours trading volume wouldbe included in the volume figures printed in the paper.Prices are more complicated. If the Big Board's last tradesare prematched, the latest U.S. price, including regionalexchanges, will still be the one printed in the paper, justlike the current system. But if two onesided orders meet inthe computer, the after-hours price (which is the same as the4 p.m. Big Board closing price) would be used, since the BigBoard trade would be considered a fair last trade.   Take, for example, a day when Ford closes at $33 at 4 p.m.on the Big Board. If the stock then trades on the Pacificexchange at $33.25 and the last after-hours Big Board tradein the stock was prematched (at the Big Board close of $33),the composite price printed in the newspaper would be $33.25.But if the Big Board's last after-hours transaction wassingle orders matched by the computer, the composite pricewould revert to $33, the matched and closing price.                                                                                                          What will happen if a company has major news to report?   After years of being prodded by federal regulators to waituntil after the Big Board's 4 p.m. close to announcemarket-moving news, many companies will now probably waituntil after 5:15 p.m. In theory, that gives investors moretime to absorb and analyze the news before trading begins thenext morning. But it will also give newspapers and eveningnews programs less time to get the company story into printor on the air.</TEXT></DOC>
