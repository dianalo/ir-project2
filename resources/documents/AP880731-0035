Shultz, in an interview on CBS-TV's ``Face the Nation,''indicated direct U.S.-Iranian talks could include discussions aboutan end to the Iran-Iraq war, terrorism and hostage-taking but notthe return of Iranian assets, which is being handled by aninternational court.   Shultz said U.S. officials are trying to find ``an authoritativechannel'' for direct talks with Iran but he has not sought ameeting with Iranian Foreign Minister Ali Akbar Velayati during theIranian official's visit to the United Nations for peace talks.   ``We don't have to go running around after people,'' Shultzsaid. But he added, ``It's important to Iran to have a relationshipwith the United States and that will emerge in due time.''   Asked if he would meet with Velayati if such a meeting wererequested, Shultz replied, ``Sure,'' adding, ``I don't know thatit's necessarily the right way to start, to have the foreignministers meet, but at any rate we have stated our policy.''   He indicated the United States continues to make contacts withIran through third countries and said U.S. officials haverepeatedly expressed a willingness to hold direct talks on ``whatit takes for them to become part of the civilized community.''   He said if Iran will stop the war, stop being involved interrorism and stop promoting the taking of hostages, then ``thereis a prospect of more normal relations with us.''   Shultz said the issue of releasing nine Americans held bypro-Iranian groups in Lebanon would have to be separate fromfinancial and other considerations.   He noted that the issue of releasing Iranian assets held by theUnited States is being handled by a claims tribunal court in TheHague and ``there is no reason to disrupt it.'' Iranian officialshave suggested they might work for release of the hostages if theassets are returned, but Reagan administration officials have saidthey will make no such deal.   Shultz described the U.S. effort to sell arms to Iran inexchange for the hostages as ``an aberration'' and said the UnitedStates has a constant policy.</TEXT></DOC>
