In an unusual move, the exchange intends to raise the required margin payment fivefold for each August futures contract, to $15,000 from $3,000, starting at the end of trading tomorrow, the Merc said. A margin payment is a good faith deposit.    At yesterday's closing price, the contract was valued at $32,540.    The move is aimed at preventing a shortage of pork bellies deliverable against the August contract.    As of Monday's close, August contracts representing delivery of about 83.2 million pounds of frozen bellies, or uncured slabs of bacon, were outstanding. However, only about seven million pounds have been certified for delivery by the exchange against the August contract, which expires next Monday at noon in Chicago.    The exchange acted &quot;to protect the integrity of the belly contract,&quot; an official said.    Prices for the August contract peaked at 92.50 cents a pound Aug. 10, before falling to yesterday's close of 81.35 cents, down the daily limit of two cents a pound. The contract has closed down its daily limit five of the past six sessions, although its price remains much higher than cash, or fresh, belly prices, which closed at about 65 cents yesterday.    During the summer when there is peak demand for bellies, the cash price should exceed the futures price, said Thomas Morgan, president of Sterling Research Corp. in Arlington Heights, Ill.    In February, the exchange sharply reduced its limit on individual traders' holdings in pork belly contracts for delivery that month. That move occurred amid a general scarcity of frozen supplies, which has continued through the summer.    Some traders speculated that the run-up in prices this month may have been the result of a possible squeeze -- a trading maneuver in which big futures buyers try in times of shortage to force sellers to pay higher and higher prices to offset their &quot;short&quot; positions, or delivery obligations.    Exchange officials denied that their action had anything to do with rumors of a squeeze. They said they are only trying to encourage an orderly liquidation of the contract. </TEXT></DOC>
