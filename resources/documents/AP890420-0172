The sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said theshelling had caused many casualties, and the refugees had beendriven deeper into Thailand.   As many as 4,000 shells fired from inside Cambodia crashed intoa wide area along Thailand's eastern Trat province on Monday andTuesday, and more landed the following day, the military and othersources said on condition of anonymity. The area was reported quieton Thursday.   ``They just covered the whole area with shells,'' one sourcesaid.   They said the areas struck included the U.N.-aided camp of TaLuan, which housed about 6,000 refugees, and Kaiche, a nearby campwhere the Khmer Rouge have not allowed Western access but where10,000 or more civilians were believed held.   Thousands of the refugees sought shelter deeper inside Thailand,including about 2,000 who fled from Kaiche to Ta Luan, sourcessaid. Ta Luan is a few miles inside Thailand.   The sources quoted the fleeing Cambodians as saying theywitnessed others killed or wounded, but no overall count waspossible. In Ta Luan, at least several wounded people, someseriously hurt, were inside houses and underground shelters. Someevidently were moved there from a camp hospital because there wereno shelters near the hospital, sources said.   Thai military sources said more than 100 houses in Ta Luan weredestroyed. Other sources said the artillery and rocket roundscarved craters there and outside the camp.   A military source said many Thais were evacuated from villagesin the area but that a 56-year-old man was killed.   The Khmer Rouge have not sent any wounded to Thai hospitals orto the border hospital of the International Red Cross. Officialshave said the Khmer Rouge fear that these people will defect ifthey are allowed outside the camps.   Urs Boegli, head of the Red Cross delegation in Thailand, saidafter visiting the stricken area: ``The (Red Cross) is veryconcerned and is negotiating with the Thai government to find asolution for these people in danger, and in particular to be ableto evacuate the wounded to the hospital at Khao-I-Dang, which wasset up for exactly this kind of emergency.''   A military source said Thai authorities were consideringevacuating the Cambodians at Ta Luan to a safer site.   Widespread human rights abuses have been reported in refugeecamps in Thailand run by the communist Khmer Rouge, which killedhundreds of thousands of people when it ruled Cambodia in 1975-78and attempted to implement a radical agrarian revolution.   The Khmer Rouge now is the strongest of three guerrilla groupsfighting Vietnamese forces that invaded Cambodia in late 1978 andthe forces of the Vietnamese-installed Phnom Penh government.   A Thai military source speculated that either Vietnamese orallied Cambodian government forces forces shelled the Ta Luan areato hurt the Khmer Rouge as much as possible before Vietnam'spromised troop pullout, which is to be completed by Sept. 30.   The area of the shelling includes major guerrilla strongholds.   Other sources said the attack may have been aimed at detering arenewed Khmer Rouge scheme to relocate people from Ta Luan toKaiche and other areas closer to the Cambodia border for militarypurposes.   Vietnamese leader Nguyen Van Linh reportedly flew to MoscowThursday for talks with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev on Vietnam'splanned military pullout from Cambodia.   Accompanying Linh on the four-day visit was Foreign MinisterNguyen Co Thach, the country's main negotiator on the Cambodianissue, Japan's Kyodo News Service reported from Hanoi, theVietnamese capital.</TEXT></DOC>
