Phase analysis of DCS and the relation D=(DCS/sub A/-DC/subA+2/)(DCS/sub A/+DCS/sub A+2/), where A - atomic number, has been performed.The analysis was performed for five analytical forms of charge densitydistribution (CDD). Surface layer thicknesses t, extremum coordinatesr/sub m/, mean squaer radii andless;r/sup 2/andgt;/sup 1/2/ for considered isotopesand models obtained from the cross section analysis are given. Differencesin CDD surface thickness {Delta}t, {Delta}r/sub m/, {Delta}andless;r/sup 2/andgt;/sup1/2/ are presented for Se isotopes distinguished by two neutrons obtainedfrom the D relation analysis. Analysis of isotopic differences in CDDvelocity properties of /sup 76,78,80,82/Se isotopes shows that with 1g/sub9/2/ neutron shell filling, t parameters decrease.</TEXT></DOC>
