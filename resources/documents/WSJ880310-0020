Robert Dole pushed through the TV cameras and reporters and bolted into the refuge of a waiting hotel elevator. For a while, at least until he could absorb his Super Tuesday disaster, he could be alone.    To the east, on Chicago's lake-front, Michael Dukakis savored victory in the happy bedlam of an old theater. As a backdrop of 75 television monitors flickered and as supporters babbled in several languages, Jack Corrigan, the candidate's director of campaign operations, attempted to summarize the night's results. &quot;We're beyond momentum-building now,&quot; he said, &quot;and into mathematics.&quot;    Now, here in Illinois, a critical moment approaches for two presidential candidates heading in different directions: Sen. Dole on the way down and Gov. Dukakis on the way up.    For Mr. Dole, Vice President George Bush's stunning sweep of all but one of the 17 Super Tuesday states makes next Tuesday's Illinois primary a do-or-die showdown; if the Kansas Republican can't win here, his candidacy undoubtedly will end.    For Mr. Dukakis, who captured eight of 20 states where Democratic delegates were at stake, a win here will give him a clear break from the pack and perhaps provide him with an air of inevitability.    The outcome could have a critical impact on the general election. Even if Mr. Dole wins -- and his situation is so dire that he may drop out of the race even before Illinois -- Vice President Bush will remain a heavy favorite to win the GOP nomination. But the race then could develop like the 1980 Democratic struggle between Jimmy Carter and Edward Kennedy: a protracted and bitter battle that weakens the nominee for the fall election.    Even if Mr. Dukakis fails to prevail here, he will remain the Democratic front-runner. A poor showing, however, would demonstrate that his nomination is by no means certain and would signal a long struggle, probably culminating in difficult political negotiations with his rivals, including the Rev. Jesse Jackson.    Both Mr. Dole and Mr. Dukakis face tough challenges here. Mr. Bush is on a powerful political roll. He has the support of much of the Illinois Republican establishment, from Gov. James Thompson on down, a healthy lead in the polls and a far better organization than Mr. Dole.    &quot;Bob Dole is walking up a very steep hill,&quot; says Donald Devine, formerly a top Dole strategist.    In the two-part Illinois process -- a non-binding contest for the presidential candidates and a separate vote for delegates by congressional districts -- Mr. Dukakis faces two home state contenders. One is Mr. Jackson, whose delegates probably will win the three predominately black congressional districts and who also could do surprisingly well in the separate non-binding statewide preference poll. The other is Sen. Paul Simon, who pulled back from the race elsewhere but is popular here in his home state and has the backing of most prominent Illinois Democrats.    Sen. Albert Gore, who scored major victories in the South Tuesday, has almost no activity here. And Rep. Richard Gephardt's strength was clearly undercut by his disappointing showings this week.    &quot;It's still a muddle,&quot; says William Hamilton, a Democratic pollster. Peter Hart, a Democratic pollster who has done election surveying for the Chicago Tribune, speculates that Mr. Simon, who was ahead in Illinois, could slip to 20% of the Democratic vote and that Mr. Jackson probably could win more than 30%. That would mean Mr. Dukakis would need to capture two-thirds of the remaining vote to win the non-binding contest -- and, even with a strong showing, he still could come away with fewer delegates than Mr. Simon.    The Republican race has far sharper contours. Mr. Dole's strategists believe the Kansan's only hope lies in Mr. Bush's weakness in the Midwest. But the vice president has prevailed where President Reagan has high ratings, and the Dole advisers acknowledge that the president's popularity here makes their task even more difficult.    As Mr. Dole and Mr. Bush gird to fight for this state's 92 GOP convention delegates, the vice president has more than 700 of the 1,139 delegates required for nomination. He needs only to win slightly more than a third of the remaining delegates to clinch the nomination. Bush strategists here now talk about a Bush nomination as a kind of mechanical inevitability.    But some analysts believe that the voters in this state might not want the GOP race to end next week. &quot;There is a history in the process so far that when the voters read the papers and see on television that somebody almost assuredly is going to get nominated,&quot; says John Sears, a GOP political strategist, &quot;there seems to be some process of revulsion that assists whoever else is still fool enough to be in the race.&quot;    Illinois is one of Mr. Dole's best-organized states. His workers have been at it for months. They have piled up thousands of paid staff hours here, have sent direct mail to every GOP household in the state and have been working the phone banks for weeks. The Dole campaign will probably pump in more than the half-million dollars it tabbed for a television campaign. And Mr. Dole has the support of some prominent Illinois Republicans, such as former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and former Reagan Agriculture Secretary John Block.    Mr. Dole's strongest area is considered to be central Illinois farm country. But Mr. Bush is considered well ahead in the more populous Chicago suburban districts, and his organizational edge may prove decisive in other areas.    Even so, some experts believe that Mr. Bush's GOP establishment support may not help him as much as his strategists expect. &quot;There's nothing about downstate Illinois that should make it Bush territory,&quot; says John Deardourff, a Republican political consultant. &quot;It's much more akin to the places Dole is comfortable in.&quot;    Former Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson, who acknowledged that he failed to meet his own expectations on Super Tuesday, is considered to have some modest pockets of strength in Southern Illinois and the Rockford area, both with traditions of evangelism. With the anticipated withdrawal today of New York Rep. Jack Kemp, who isn't expected to make an endorsement, Mr. Robertson is the only candidate remaining from the party's conservative wing.    Bush aides already are attempting to paint his campaign as an uncontainable force, and they believe they will be able to lure Dole supporters who increasingly will view the Kansan as a lost cause. &quot;They'll begin to wonder if they're riding the wrong horse,&quot; says Ed Mauraine, a leading Bush strategist in Illinois.    For Gov. Dukakis, the question in Illinois is how much difference his money and momentum, plus a planned five-day campaign blitz here, will make in a state where Democratic politics often revolves around parochial concerns.    &quot;It's not so much we're looking at a particular segment of the vote,&quot; says Tad Devine, the national field director for the Dukakis campaign. &quot;This process moves very quickly, and we think that by succeeding -- by doing well, as we did on Super Tuesday -- we can attract attention and more support.&quot;    Mr. Jackson is given a shot at a plurality in the state's non-binding beauty contest. The key variable is how much erosion occurs now in the favorite-son candidacy of Sen. Simon. The cool-eyed pragmatists of the Cook County white organization have largely backed the senator's delegate slates thus far -- not because they expect him to be nominated but because they want to go to the Democratic convention as delegates themselves.    Yesterday, Alderman Edward M. Burke, who oversees a ward of Eastern European ethnic groups, in his office below a time-and-temperature sign emblazoned with his name, insisted that Super Tuesday results &quot;don't change anything.&quot;    &quot;Our guys will punch for Simon,&quot; he says, and predicts the Illinois senator will get the biggest bloc of this state's delegates -- to control at least until he drops out and fades away. That analysis is shared by the man who helped save Walter Mondale's Illinois bacon from Gary Hart in 1984 -- then Democrat but now Republican Edward R. Vrdolyak. &quot;Those fellas want to go to the convention,&quot; he says of his former compatriots in the Cook County Democratic organization. &quot;Voters will be voting for them, not the candidate.&quot;    Already the outlines of a stop-Dukakis movement are visible in Illinois. Aides to Mr. Simon and Mr. Gore have talked about how to stop the flow of support to the Massachusetts governor, and Mr. Gephardt may focus his energies on places where he could hurt Gov. Dukakis so Mr. Simon can reap more delegates.    Each of the Democrats has his own set of problems in this state.    Sen. Simon, already in debt, says he currently hasn't any plans to run a paid media campaign here. Sen. Gore hasn't even filed a full slate of Illinois delegates and, having skipped Iowa and gotten nowhere in New Hampshire, he has yet to prove he has a successful strategy for the Northern industrial states. Rep. Gephardt, who has some strength in Illinois farm country, smaller industrial cities such as Rock Island and parts of the state within the range of St. Louis television, is running out of money. He seems to be subtly downgrading Illinois and talking up Michigan, down the line.    Turnout is another unknown factor. To capitalize here, Gov. Dukakis would like to see a heavy turnout, especially in such pockets of strength as the Chicago lakefront and suburbs. But that may not happen: Illinois registration is below 1984, and no presidential candidate has yet caught fire.    ---                  The Delegate Count    Republicans      Bush                            705.00      Dole                            163.00      Kemp                             39.00      Robertson                        17.00      Uncommitted                      35.00      Needed to nominate            1,139.00    Democrats      Dukakis                         454.50      Jackson                         396.55      Gore                            345.50      Gephardt                        143.00      Simon                            35.50      Uncommitted                     259.65      Needed to nominate            2,082.00    Source: The Associated Press</TEXT></DOC>
