(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Nowadays, any computer maker seeking legitimacy and profits offers atop-of-the-line tower based on the fastest available microprocessor (a 33-MHz486) and a high-performance mass storage system.andM;Hewlett-Packard adds a new twist to its latest server-the Vectra 486/33T-withone of the first implementations of a SCSI-2 storage system.andP;  SCSI-2 givesthe Vectra the capability of handling up to 100 Unix terminals or 200 networknodes with the speed of a drive array but with none of the worries of aproprietary technology.andM;As with other servers from major vendors, the Vectra is built like aminicomputer-a sturdy steel chassis clothed in plastic that stands 24.5 by8.25 by 20.5 inches (HWD)-and priced to match.andP;  The base system equippedsolely with a floppy disk drive and 4MB of RAM costs $9,499.andP;  The minimalSCSI-2 system with a 440MB hard disk costs $14,499, the same range as asimilarly equipped Compaq Systempro or IBM PS/2 Model 95 486-based fileserver.andM;Despite its high-quality design and construction, the Vectra's microprocessorperformance scores only in the middle of the 33-MHz 486 pack.andP;  It keeps upwith the others but does not blaze ahead.andP;  On PC Magazine Labs' benchmarktests, even the Vectra's EISA-based SCSI-2 system is a disappointment-quickbut little improved over ordinary SCSI disk systems on the EISA bus.andM;The reasons are twofold: DOS and the benchmark tests don't test SCSI'smultitasking power, and Hewlett-Packard doesn't fully tap the capabilities ofSCSI-2.andP;  However, Headland Technology's 16-bit Super VGA adapter demonstratedexcellent VGA compatibility and performance on par with the fastest in theindustry.andM;The Vectra SCSI-2 system, based on an Adaptec 1740 SCSI-2 host adapter withspecial HP firmware, sticks with the 8-bit bus and slower transfer rate ofthe original SCSI spec.andP;  As far as performance is concerned, it advances toSCSI-2 only by using tagged command queuing (which is wasted onsingle-threaded DOS).andM;The stylish system holds eight full 32-bit EISA expansion slots and up to sixhalf-height 5.25-inch drives.andP;  Four proprietary expansion slots comeprefilled with a massive memory board capable of holding 64MB in 8MB SIMMs(IMB, 2MB, and 4MB SIMMs are also accommodated); a CPU board with 128K ofexternal cache; an 1/O board with one serial and one parallel port, and asecond 1/O board with a second serial port, plus mouse and keyboard ports.andO;Floppy disk control circuitry for up to four drives and an IDE hard diskinterface are built into the systemboard's circuitry.andP;  The 262.5-watt powersupply automatically adjusts to any standard supply voltage in the world.andM;The Vectra 486/33T has everything it needs to be a workhorse server.andP;  Whileit doesn't stand out, it will likely stand up to whatever job you give it.andO;Vectra 486/33T Hewlett-Packard Co., 19310 Pruneridge Ave., Cupertino, CA95014; 800-752-0900.andP;  List Price: With 4MB RAM, 170MB IDE hard disk, 1.2MB or1.44MB floppy disk, $11,249; with 440MB SCSI-2 hard disk, $14,499; with1,000MB SCSI-2 hard disk, $17,799.andP;  in Short: The Vectra 486/33T is in thesame price range as a similarly equipped Compaq Systempro or IBM PS/2 Model95, but the Vectra has one of the first implementations of a SCSI-2 storagesystem.andP;  The Vectra doesn't have blazing speed, but it should handle whateverjob you give it.andP;  SMALL COMPUTER SYSTEM INTERFACE: Take Two The SmallComputer System Interface (SCSI) is an interconnection scheme for connectingperipherals of nearly any sort to PCs.andP;  Not just a disk interface, it's morelike an extended expansion bus with its own control language and a parallelconnection.andM;While the original SCSI design has been warmly received since its 1986introduction, manufacturers have chosen to implement their own versions ofits features.andP;  As a result, the first iteration SCSI has become more a pointof departure than a standard, and matching SCSI components is more of achallenge than a certainty.andM;Enter SCSI-2.andP;  This revision to the spec should make the SCSI standard lessopen to interpretation by individual manufacturers.andP;  It defines a commonimplementation for SCSI so that different manufacturers' products are morelikely to work with one another.andP;  SCSI-2 also broadens the variety of devicesexplicitly supported by defining specific command sets for peripherals suchas tape drives, CD-ROM drives, and other optical drives.andM;Most intriguing is the new performance potential of SCSI-2.andP;  The originalSCSI specification specified an 8bit connection that operated at 2MB persecond asynchronously or 4MB per second synchronously.andM;SCSI-2 optionally extends the width of the SCSI bus to 16 or 32 bits andallows faster synchronous speeds across the bus to boost the maximumthroughput of the SCSI-2 bus to 40MB per second, even faster than the EISAbus (33MB per second).andM;SCSI-2 also supports tagged command queuing.andP;  This allows several commands tobe downloaded to a SCSI-2 device and carried out in turn without any furtherhost intervention.andP;  Drives no longer have to wait for the host computer totell them what to do next.andM;So far no commercial PC products take advantage of all of these SCSI-2innovations, but that gives the standard growing room and promises to makenew product introductions even more exciting.-W.L.R.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
