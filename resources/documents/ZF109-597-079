 The read/write heads in optical devicesnever make contact with the disk, which makes them less likely to sufferdamage from particles that penetrate the sealing of Winchester drives.andM;And because they are removable, optical devices can easily be stored away ina locked safe or taken off-site to a storage vault -- a major securitybenefit.andM;The estimated shelf life of an optical disk ranges from 10 to 50 years, whichmakes them ideal for long-term archiving with no risk of data degradation.andO;Magnetic tape, by contrast, has an average shelf life of two years.andM;Paul Anderson, overseer of computer support for DGR andamp; Associates, anengineering consulting firm in Rock Rapids, Iowa, said optical disks aresturdier than tapes.andM;&quot;Thinking in terms of shelf life, tape lasts only so long sitting in a safe,&quot;he said.andP;  &quot;The optical disk's shelf life is longer; optical media is morereliable.&quot;andM;Mike Pollitt, network administrator at Northern Trust Bank Corp. in Chicago,agreed: &quot;Optical disks are not as volatile as tapes,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Tapes can bedestroyed by a magnetic field.andP;  You'd have to put in a lot of effort todestroy an optical disk.&quot;andM;Dave Levenson, LAN consultant for Compuware Services Inc., a Needham, Mass.,andO;consulting firm, and a user of Mountain Network Solutions Inc.'s File Talk1.1, added that an optical disk's durability could prevent data loss.andP;  &quot;Tapestretches with time,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;With optical disks, you don't have to worryabout data loss.&quot;andM;Optical technology is still evolving in a variety of forms, including WORM,read-only and rewritable optical disks.andM;WORM disks, because they have large capacities and can be written to, areoriented toward archival storage.andP;  Since they cannot be erased and reused,though, they remain an intermediate step toward the goal of erasable,rewritable optical disks.andM;Erasable optical disks currently use standard-sized 5-1/4-inch disks housedin removable cartridges.andP;  Each erasable optical disk stores as much as 650Mbytes of data, but jukeboxes allow as much as 50G bytes of on-line storage,with an access time of 10 seconds or less.andM;&quot;There is a quicker transfer of information from an optical disk to the fileserver than from a tape to the file server,&quot; said Levenson.andP;  &quot;This is due tothe speed that the disk spins and its random-access feature, which allows youto get to the part of the sector where the data is stored.&quot;andM;Levenson added that optical disks also provide a higher storage capacity.andM;&quot;The optical disk will hold more information than any tape because theinformation on disk is more compact than it is on tape,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Withtape, you have to take into consideration that you fit less information persector than on a disk.&quot;andM;Optical disks cannot compare with Winchester hard disks when it comes tospeed and cost, however.andP;  They are only about one-quarter to one-half as fastas a quick Winchester drive, and, with prices starting at $3,500, can costtwice as much.andM;Erasable optical drives cost between $4,000 and $6,000, and access timesrange from 30 to 80 milliseconds.andM;Despite the cost, optical drives attract users because they accessinformation almost as quickly as magnetic media.andM;Scott Davis, systems manager for Seattle's Fred Hutchinson Cancer ResearchCenter, uses Palindrome Corp.'s Network Archivist data-management systemnightly to back up 2G bytes of data on the center's Novell NetWare 386network.andP;  Problems surface when Davis must restore information from tape,which he considers a time-consuming process.andM;&quot;The data sets are so large and we have so much data on the tape that ittakes a long time to get to a particular file to restore it,&quot; Davis said.andM;The lengthy restore process prevents Davis from archiving information.andP;  &quot;If Iset up the system to archive information not used for a month,&quot; Davisexplained, &quot;there would be a lot of information to archive.andP;  But I would needto restore a lot of files because other users need them.andP;  If the restore timecould be addressed, I could be more aggressive about archiving.&quot;andM;An optical backup system's random-access feature could reduce restorationtime, according to Davis.andP;  &quot;I would like to have an optical system with thePalindrome Network Archivist's intelligence and management features,&quot; hesaid.andM;Still, magnetic tape and disk subsystems are better bets with regard to costper megabyte of on-line storage.andP;  For a storage configuration that includes adrive, a controller and one piece of media with a 1.5G-byte storage capacity,an 8mm drive would average $4 per on-line megabyte, a magnetic disk wouldaverage about $8 per megabyte, and an erasable optical drive would top thelist at $20 per megabyte.andM;Optical systems carry high price tags, and this kept DGR andamp; Associates frominvesting in optical storage, said Anderson.andM;&quot;The optical system is nice, and we would have liked to have gone to that,but it is too expensive,&quot; Anderson said.andP;  &quot;To put 1.3G bytes on tape costs us$25, whereas to back up 600M bytes on an optical disk would cost $200.andM;&quot;The initial tape-drive investment is comparable to the investment in theoptical-disk technology,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;But in the long run, the optical disk isexpensive.&quot;andM;Although optical-disk technology might ultimately cost more than tape, itsflexibility could allow for wider applications.andM;&quot;The backup system is a good medium on which to mix graphics, voice andtext,&quot; Levenson said.andP;  &quot;It would be good for setting up tutorials for usersof different applications, such as Lotus 1-2-3 and ZSoft Corp.'s PCPaintbrush.andP;  The information would be on-screen, but the voice would instructthe user what to do.&quot;andM;&quot;Right now, I don't see much benefit from optical disks for the everydayuser,&quot; Levenson said.andP;  &quot;In the future, I see optical disks replacing floppydiskettes and hard drives.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
