Seib (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> MIAMI  </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan launched his first detailed attack on Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, labeling him a &quot;true liberal&quot; who would be sure to raise taxes and imperil economic recovery if elected president.    In a speech here that marked his full-scale entry into the presidential campaign, Mr. Reagan blasted the management record of Mr. Dukakis, who has clinched the Democratic presidential nomination largely by talking about his performance as governor.    The president charged that Mr. Dukakis has raised state taxes, increased spending at twice the federal government's rate and squandered &quot;every dime and more&quot; of revenue generated by &quot;the Reagan-Bush economic recovery.&quot;    But while lambasting Mr. Dukakis -- whom he referred to only as &quot;the Democrats' all but certain presidential candidate&quot; -- Mr. Reagan had little of substance to say about his own vice president, George Bush, who has clinched the Republican presidential nomination.    The Dukakis campaign dismissed Mr. Reagan's remarks, arguing that Mr. Dukakis has run a more fiscally disciplined government than has the president.    Mr. Reagan has signed four bills that increased taxes since he became president. Since returning to the Massachusetts governor's office in 1983, Mr. Dukakis has approved one tax increase -- this year's rise in the cigarette tax. But shortly after he was first elected in 1976, he imposed a surcharge on the state income tax to balance the state budget.    The Dukakis campaign doesn't dispute the statement that spending in Massachusetts has increased twice as rapidly as that of the federal government.    Mr. Reagan previously has taken some swipes at Gov. Dukakis in off-the-cuff remarks, but yesterday's speech, given at a fund-raiser for GOP Senate candidate Connie Mack, was more detailed. It was significant because it showed the lines of attack Mr. Reagan is likely to pursue as he campaigns this summer and fall for other Republicans. Though Mr. Reagan's reputation may be tarnished by the scandals that have plagued the last two years of his presidency, Republicans still consider him their most formidable fund-raiser and perhaps their most effective campaigner.    The speech suggested that in this year's campaign, the president will stress the U.S.'s current 66-month-old economic expansion, assert that Mr. Dukakis's &quot;liberal&quot; tendencies would endanger those gains and praise Mr. Bush without making a detailed pitch on the vice president's behalf. White House aides argue that Mr. Bush will be better off promoting his own attributes himself, rather than relying on Mr. Reagan to do it for him.    Judging from the speech, Mr. Reagan will work in concert with the Bush campaign to try to make taxes a central campaign issue. Mr. Bush has said flatly that he wouldn't raise any taxes to close the federal deficit, while Mr. Dukakis has said he would impose new taxes only as &quot;a last resort.&quot;    The president also is helping the Bush campaign attack what Mr. Dukakis regards as his principal asset: his claim that he presided over an economic &quot;miracle&quot; in Massachusetts.    Mr. Reagan criticized Mr. Dukakis in particular for his recent decision to close a Massachusetts revenue gap in part by raising some taxes. &quot;So, yes, the man expected to head up the Democratic ticket . . . is a true liberal who, instead of controlling government spending, raises taxes,&quot; Mr. Reagan said.    While raising taxes, Mr. Reagan contended, Mr. Dukakis &quot;has increased Massachusetts' state spending at double the rate of federal spending.&quot; Further, Mr. Reagan charged, &quot;He has spent every dime and more of the revenue generated in his state by the Reagan-Bush recovery. And since 1986, while the federal budget deficit has been cut sharply, his deficit in Massachusetts has ballooned.&quot;    In fact, Mr. Dukakis hasn't run up a deficit, because Massachusetts law requires a balanced budget. But he did have to scramble at the last minute this year to overcome the unexpected shortage of state revenue.    Mr. Reagan also criticized proposals by Mr. Dukakis and other Democrats that businesses be required to help finance health insurance plans, saying the plans would impose a &quot;gigantic tax&quot; on business. </TEXT></DOC>
