South Koreans were shocked by the killings of the officers, seton fire by radical students May 3, and angrily demanded an end todemonstrations. Government and opposition leaders all say theprotests have gone too far and the violence must end.   Some radical students have promised to stop violentdemonstrations and using firebombs. Several dissident groupsapologized to police for the deaths, and many observers predict alull in protests.   At the same time, most political leaders and other observersagree the basic causes of unrest have not changed and the strugglebetween the government and its opponents is far from over.   South Korea must overcome many problems to achieve stability,including ending a legacy of authoritarian rule, bitter rivalrybetween political parties and the impact of rapid economic andsocial change. Violent demonstrations are a symptom of these largerproblems.   Since violence is the radicals' most effective tool, it seemsunlikely they will renounce it for long, especially if thegovernment continues to crush dissent. Violence has been a part ofKorean politics and life for many years, and there is little chanceof it disappearing overnight.   Government statistics show there were 1,512 major protests inthe first four months of this year, in which students used morethan 300,000 firebombs and injured 3,800 police officers.   Korean politics are dominated by an acrimonious power struggle.Opposition parties have not accepted the government of Roh Tae-wooand constantly try to weaken or discredit it.   Roh, a former general who narrowly won 1987 presidentialelections after rival candidates split the opposition vote, insistshe is committed to bringing full democracy. But critics on the leftand the right charge Roh is indecisive and is not overcoming manyof the problems.   Bitter feuding between the government and opposition hasproduced constant political confusion and unrest. The oppositionparties' drive against the government has been blunted only bychronic feuding and attempts to wreck each other.   Opposition leaders are targets of growing public criticism forpursuing their own ambitions for power and failing to help buildstability. Many Koreans say they are tired of politics, but theregional loyalties and factionalism on which politics are basedhelp keep squabbling politicians in power.   South Korea still is dominated by a traditional ruling elitedrawn from the military, government bureaucracy and industrialists,despite democratic reforms since the authoritarian regime of ChunDoo-hwan was forced out after massive riots in 1987.   Some political observers and opposition leaders say realdemocracy won't be possible until the control of the elite isended. The opposition says the establishment will try to blockdemocracy if its hold on power is threatened.   The deepest changes in South Korea may come from rapidindustrialization and Westernizing of this once poor, backwardsociety. South Korea's meteoric rise as an industrial power hasbeen accompanied by the growing sophistication of many of itspeople, who expect to run their country and share in its new wealth.   Professionals, skilled workers and others who produce the cars,ships and other goods that have made South Korea an economic forceare not willing to accept unresponsive governments that try toorder people around.   A wave of labor strikes in recent months has been inspired bydemands for better pay and an end to the long hours and poorworking conditions many Koreans endure for little better thansubsistence wages.   Radical students and dissidents contend the Roh government is afront for military rule. Dissident leaders call for the overthrowof the government and creation of an ill-defined government of themasses.   The government says the radicals are leftist revolutionariestrying to destroy democracy. But the radicals have virtually nopublic support because of their extreme views and violent tactics.They are no major threat to the government.   Radical leaders say time is on their side because industrialworkers eveutally will join them and fight for their utopian dream.But most observers say the workers want a share of Korea's wealthand a democratic government controlled by the people.   The problem is overcoming the many obstacles that stand in theway.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Barry Renfrew, the AP bureau chief in Seoul, hascovered Asia for six years.</TEXT></DOC>
