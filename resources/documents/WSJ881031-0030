The department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration charged the meatpacker with willfully ignoring these injuries at its plant in Sioux Falls, S.D. Morrell is a subsidiary of United Brands Co., Cincinnati.    The occupational illness, called cumulative trauma disorder, involves injuries caused by repeated hand, wrist and arm motions during work. The problem is widespread in the meatpacking and some other industries, and OSHA wants the action against Morrell to help &quot;improve recognition and awareness&quot; of the problem among meatpackers, said John Pendergrass, the head of OSHA.    The incidence of the injuries involved in the citation for the Sioux Falls plant, covering the year ended April 30, 1988, was 41.7 per 100 full-time workers, or nine times the annual industry average, OSHA said. The company knew of the problem as early as 1984 but did little to correct it, the agency said.    Morrell released a lengthy statement calling the OSHA action &quot;grossly unfair and totally unjustified.&quot; The company said it may seek a court injunction to block the OSHA move. Otherwise, Morrell will have 15 days to appeal the charges to the separate federal Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission.    Morrell said OSHA has failed to acknowledge a &quot;major safety improvement&quot; program begun by the company over the past year, and a sharp reduction in the Sioux Falls plant's overall injury rate since July to half the industry average.    In the past few months, the cumulative-trauma injury rate at the plant has been cut to about 3.52 per 100 workers, or 83% from the first half of 1988, the Morrell figures showed.    &quot;I hope that's true, that the company is addressing the problem,&quot; said Terry Mikelson, an OSHA spokesman. But he said that as of two months ago, the last time OSHA inspectors visited the Sioux Falls plant, &quot;we found little evidence&quot; of any improvement.    Fully 880 of 2,000 employees at the Morrell plant sustained serious and sometimes disabling cumulative-trauma injuries between May 1987 and April 1988, OSHA said. According to the agency, the company forced affected workers to stay on the production line, even in some cases involving surgery.    OSHA said that in 63 of 180 cases requiring surgery, the average time off was 1.1 days, with 27 not getting any time off, although the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health regards 30 to 60 days as necessary recuperative time for such surgery. The institute is a unit of the Health and Human Services Department.    Sometimes, work restrictions recommended by doctors were ignored by the company, according to OSHA and the United Food andamp; Commercial Workers Union, which has complained for several years about unsafe conditions at the plant.    Milton Schloss, chairman of Morrell, said the company has followed the advice of safety experts it retained, to vary the daily work routine so workers use different muscle groups. But union work rules and the grievance process have often blocked Morrell's job-rotation efforts, he said.    OSHA recommended such actions as redesigning knives or work stations to make the work easier, slowing production lines, training workers to recognize early symptoms of the disorder, rotating them among different jobs, and assigning them to slower, easier work after injuries occur.    Mr. Schloss also said Morrell hired replacement workers at Sioux Falls in 1987 after its plant employees went on strike, and the new workers showed a much higher injury rate. OSHA's Mr. Mikelson said the fact that the replacements suffered so many injuries may indicate that the disorder develops quickly, at least under extreme conditions such as those at Sioux Falls.    Last May, OSHA proposed $3.1 million in fines against IBP Inc., the nation's largest meatpacker, charging violations involving cumulative trauma at its plant in Dakota City, Neb. IBP, 51%-owned by Occidental Petroleum Corp., is contesting the citation.    The largest fine previously proposed by OSHA was $4.1 million, for shipyard construction-safety charges against Bath Iron Works Corp., a unit of Gibbons, Green, van Amerongen Ltd., of New York. In a recent settlement, the company agreed to pay $650,000 in penalties and to help finance a state center for occupational health and safety training in Maine.    In a related matter, a review-commission administrative law judge on Oct. 18 threw out OSHA citations against Morrell. The citations, issued in April 1987, charged record-keeping violations. The official disallowed OSHA's instance-by-instance citation, which proposed a total fine of $690,000. The official also said OSHA didn't issue the citation within the six months, specified by law, from the time an official inspection begins.    OSHA will probably appeal the ruling to the full commission.    Last week, current and former workers at Morrell plants filed a suit seeking $35 million in unpaid wages, overtime and penalties, alleging that the meatpacker failed to pay about 5,000 workers for time spent putting on, taking off and cleaning safety equipment. </TEXT></DOC>
