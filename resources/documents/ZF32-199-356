(TheWeek in Review; 1991 Dyson PC Forum) (column)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Passarella, Ed.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>It's really all about communication, isn't it?andP;  Intel's Andy Grove believesit.andP;  He told the assembled luminaries at Esther Dyson's desert convocationthat enriched communication will be the next explosive application.andP;  Grove,whose chip-making leadership observers say will suffer little from AMD's 386(Pages 1 and 139), also spent a couple of hours getting a private Lotus Notesdemo from Jim Manzi.andM;Notes served as the communications medium of choice at the Dyson PC Forum(Page 140), giving Manzi an opportunity to show off the product and fire thefirst quip of the event with a reference to &quot;disinformation at yourfingertips.&quot;andM;Meanwhile, Lotus' new mail partner, cc:Mail, shows up this week both on thepresenters' list in Tucson and in our First Look at cc:Mail for the Mac.andP;  Wefind the upgrade a worthy companion to the DOS version (Page 43).andM;Adobe's John Warnock sees things differently, offering up PostScript as thekey to the &quot;ASCII jail&quot; currently imprisoning electronic communications.andO;Back at the ranch, we review five PostScript printers (Page 77) and take aFirst Look at Adobe's font-rendering competition: TrueType (Page 1).andP;  We alsoreport third-party support for the Apple implementation of TrueType (Page29).andM;To attain the &quot;richness&quot; of E-mail described by Grove, developers will drawon object orientation -- the second major Dyson topic.andP;  Patriot Partners,whose president, Dave Liddle, stresses the Constellation Project name overthe company name to inhibit confusion with the now famous missile, willupdate the industry on its operating-system plans at SPA (Page 5).andM;Patriot Partners, an IBM-Metaphor coalition, however, remains the last majorholdout to membership in the Object Management Group now that Microsoft hassigned on (Page 6).andM;Beyond the issues of network connections and objects, we're left with thethird leg of the communications tripod: portability.andP;  In Tucson and inGermany (Page 1), mobile pen-wielding users loom as a major marketopportunity.andP;  For the present, though, notebook news reigns.andP;  We take FirstLooks at Dell's 386SX (Page 1), at Microsoft's BallPoint trackball (Page 15)and at two totable printers (Page 19).andP;  IBM's laptop (Page 4) and others'plans for 386SL-based machines (Page 14) also make news this week.andM;Finally, as Spencer reports (Page 146), the unofficial fourth topic atDyson's forum turned out to be reports of an FTC probe into Microsoft and IBM(Page 1).andP;  Bill Gates' subtle shot at Lotus -- a reference to &quot;Iris Notes&quot;--quickly faded beside the flurry of questions (eagerly fueled by Microsoftfoes) about the FTC.andM;We suspect that before long we'll need what PenSoft President Michael Baumcalls a &quot;disambiguation dialogue.&quot;andM;-- Ed Passarella</TEXT></DOC>
