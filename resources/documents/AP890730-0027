District Attorney Lewis R. Slaton had been investigating whetherto charge Lowe in the videotaping of Jan Parsons, then 16, in a sexscene with a woman in an Atlanta hotel room when Lowe was attendingthe 1988 Democratic National Convention.   Lowe, 25, is one of 2,600 people to participate in Georgia'spretrial intervention program, which Slaton called an alternativeto prosecution for young, non-violent first offenders.   ``He fit the description of the program and the fact that hehappened to be famous didn't work against him,'' Slaton said. ``Ifhe completes the program in the two years' time and there are noother problems, he's cleared from prosecution.''   Lowe and his father met with Slaton on Friday, almost a yearafter the alleged incident.   He remains the subject of a civil suit brought by Miss Parsons'mother, Lena Arlene Wilson, who claims Lowe seduced her daughter.   Lowe's Atlanta attorney, Edgar A. Neely III, said his client'sagreement is not an admission of guilt in the civil suit.   ``This case is not the kind that you'd take to a grand juryanyway,'' he said, adding that Lowe made ``an error in judgment,not a criminal thing.''   Initial reports on the agreement referred to two years ofcommunity service and omitted the 20-hour requirment.   Slaton said exact terms of the program will be worked out in thenext few weeks, but that Lowe basically is expected to visit about20 schools in the Los Angeles area over the next two years to makespeeches on topics such as drugs and the law.   ``He also has expressed some interest in some schools outside ofLos Angeles, so that's one of the details they'll work out,''Slaton said. ``Then anytime he does something, makes a speech foran hour or something, it will be tabulated here until he's done.''   Slaton said Lowe is to be supervised by the Georgia Departmentof Labor, which runs the program.   The criminal charge of sexual exploitation of a minor, whichLowe might have faced, carries a maximum penalty of 20 years inprison and a $100,000 fine, Slaton said.   Lowe stared in such movies as ``About Last Night...,'' ``St.Elmo's Fire'' and ``Oxford Blues.''</TEXT></DOC>
