Residents of the Brooklyn neighborhood where the group - calledthe Gulleymen Posse - was headquartered greeted the raiders as aliberating army, authorities said.   James M. Fox, head of the FBI New York office, estimated thatthe gang took in more than $100 million in the last five years andcarried out at least 10 murders on orders of its leader, EricVassell.   The raids were conducted at several sites in Brooklyn, and inHempstead, Uniondale and Albany, and in Dallas.   Vassell escaped arrest and was believed to be in the New Yorkarea. Eighteen of 42 alleged posse members were arrested. Ifconvicted, all face life in prison on narcotics conspiracies andracketeering charges that include murder, said Andrew J. Maloney,the federal prosecutor in Brooklyn. They also are accused of moneylaundering and obtaining fraudulent passports and green cards.   Besides the suspects, the raiders seized more than $150,000 incash, six buildings and 15 guns.   The case was broken with information provided by several gangmembers now serving life sentences on guilty pleas to variouscrimes, including murder, Maloney said.   ``Among their own, they were vicious, absolutely vicious,'' Foxsaid. ``This guy Vassell would kill his own people for a seriousreason or for a trivial reason. He killed someone because thatperson said something nasty to his sister.''   Maloney described Vassell as a 31-year-old Jamaican who hasfathered 14 to 18 children by various women and has ties to theruling People's National Party in Jamaica.   Vassell ``used part of his money to contribute to the PNP andit's very likely he'll flee back to Jamaica hoping for some kind ofprotection there,'' Maloney said.   ``Every time Vassell returned to Jamaica, he took a lot oftelevision sets and he usually had three or four guns stashedinside of each set,'' Fox said.   In the complaint filed by Maloney's office, an informant isquoted as saying that guns shipped to Jamaica inside TV sets inFebruary were ``vote-getters'' to be used in a runoff on theisland.   ``Whenever there is a major event in Jamaica ... Vassell sends ashipment of guns,'' the complaint said.   Maloney told reporters he was not alleging that Jamaican PrimeMinister Michael Manley knew what was Vassell was doing.   Federal officials said the Gulleymen Posse got its name from theMcGregors Gully section of Kingston, where its members were from.   The posse was a heroin wholesaling and distributing operation inBrooklyn during the last decade and branched into crack in the late1980s, when it expanded to Dallas, officials said.   The posse spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in car rentalsto run crack from Brooklyn to Dallas and return with guns everyweek, the government said.   Fox said posse members offered virtually no resistance when theysaw the SWAT teams descend.   He said one of the arrested men said to an agent: ```You thinkwe are a posse? You 200 cops, that's a real posse.'''</TEXT></DOC>
