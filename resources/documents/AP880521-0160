(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Defrocked TV evangelist Jimmy Swaggartplans to return to the pulpit Sunday, three months after he made atearful confession of sin and was accused of hiring a prostitute topose for him in a motel room.   The ensuing fight in the Assemblies of God over the length ofSwaggart's punishment led to his dismissal from the Pentecostaldenomination April 8.   ``It has been nearly three months since I stepped down from theministry, and now we feel that it is in God's timing for us to comeback,'' Swaggart said in the May issue of The Evangelist, themagazine of Jimmy Swaggart World Ministries.   He said his return to his ministry's Family Worship Centersanctuary, which is not scheduled to be televised live, ``will be aglorious time as the choir starts to sing the beginning song andthe 7,000-strong congregation joins in.''   His return comes amid financial problems for his ministry, theresignations of several key administrators and a report thatseveral top-level officials will leave Jimmy Swaggart BibleCollege, part of the ministry's complex outside Baton Rouge.   Although Swaggart did not specify his sin when he stepped downFeb. 21, Assemblies of God officials have said he was photographedwith a woman outside a New Orleans motel.   Marvin Gorman, a defrocked minister who contends in a lawsuitthat Swaggart ruined his New Orleans ministry with false rumors ofadulterous affairs, reportedly hired private detectives to take thepictures.   A prostitute has said that Swaggart paid her to pose nude forhim. The woman, Debra Murphree, is scheduled to be the subject of aphoto spread and interview in Penthouse magazine next month.   Swaggart's hiatus is in accordance with a three-month suspensionordered by the Louisiana council of the Assemblies shortly afterhis confession.   National leaders of the denomination, however, overruled thestate council and ordered Swaggart out of the pulpit and offtelevision for at least a year. Swaggart refused and thedenomination dismissed him after he submitted his resignation.   Swaggart, who has avoided preaching on television during hisexile, recently appeared on a telethon in which he said theministry needs $6 million, much of it to pay stations that carryhis programs.   ``We are scraping the bottom,'' Swaggart said on the telecast.   Ministry officials refuse to say how much was raised. However,Swaggart's appearance led three cable television outlets _ the PTLnetwork, the Christian Broadcasting Network and Black EntertainmentTelevision _ to cancel his programs. The three networks reach atotal of about 70 million homes.   On Friday, the Baton Rouge State-Times reported that a number oftop-level administrators plan to leave the Bible college.   Several weeks ago, at least six high-ranking officials ofSwaggart's ministry left their posts, including two who startedtheir own churches in the Baton Rouge area.   Ministry officials have been silent about the reports, but theministry's magazine makes it clear there are financial problems. Anadvertisement boosting seven crusades scheduled by Swaggart for therest of the year notes that one in June in Toronto has beenpostponed.   In the back of the magazine, a four-page spread notes that suchitems as a videotape of ``The Best of Jimmy Swaggart'' and recordalbums of Swaggart's songs are available at cut-rate prices.``We've slashed prices on overstocked ministry items _ save up to50 percent!'' the advertisement proclaims.   Despite the problems, Swaggart said he is confident his ministrywill survive and prosper.   Speaking to about 300 people at a prayer meeting Wednesdaynight, Swaggart described himself as ``an unworthy vessel'' and a``crippled preacher,'' but said he still carries God's word.   ``He (God) does not abrogate calls. ... He does not call andchange his mind,'' Swaggart said. God ``will allow many things tohappen that will bring things to pass that he wants to come topass.''</TEXT></DOC>
