Creditors holding about $75 million face amount of unsecured debt would receive 85% of Care's equity; the rest would be retained by existing shareholders. Care said its secured creditors, who are owed about $40 million, would be repaid under &quot;terms and conditions to be decided prior to plan confirmation.&quot; Under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, a company is protected from creditors' lawsuits while it forms a plan to pay its debts.    As part of the pact, Robert Baldwin Jr., chief operating officer, was named interim chief executive officer, succeeding Lee Bangerter, who remains chairman. Dee Bangerter stepped down as chief financial officer, Care said. The Bangerters, twin brothers who helped found Care with their mother, remain directors.    Mr. Baldwin said he expects the plan to be presented to the Los Angeles bankruptcy court at a Sept. 15 hearing. </TEXT></DOC>
