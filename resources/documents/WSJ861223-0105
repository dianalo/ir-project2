Webb Corp. said that Thomas E. Arnold resigned as president, 11 months after he was elected to the position.    The company, which has interests in gambling, real estate and construction, said that Mr. Arnold, 42 years old, resigned to pursue other interests. It said that Robert K. Swanson, who is chairman and chief executive officer, will reassume the responsibilities of president. Mr. Swanson, 54, held all three titles prior to Mr. Arnold's election as president last January. Mr. Arnold also resigned as a director of the company.    Analysts said that Mr. Swanson's assumption of Mr. Arnold's responsibilities signals a new emphasis on the company's real estate operations, which had been reporting to Mr. Arnold.    Mr. Swanson said in an interview that there will be no change in corporate direction or emphasis. He said that his resumption of direct responsibility for real estate operations was the result of &quot;a failed experiment,&quot; but that the parting was amicable. For his part, Mr. Arnold said in an interview that he &quot;simply didn't like&quot; the position of president of a publicly traded company. Prior to being elected president, Mr. Arnold was an executive vice president with the company.    Mr. Arnold also resigned as chairman and as a director of Del E. Webb Investment Properties Inc., a separate real estate investment trust that was sponsored by Del E. Webb Corp. when Webb Investment Properties was established last year.    Del E. Webb said that Philip J. Dion, 42, executive vice president for administration and chief financial officer of the principal company, was named chairman of Webb Investment Properties. </TEXT></DOC>
