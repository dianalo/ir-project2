(local areanetworks)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Davis, Dwight B.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The cost of fiber optic LANs is considerably higher than that ofcoaxial or twisted-pair networks, therefore vendors are targetingniche applications for the technology and supporting the FiberDistributed Data Interface (FDDI) standard.andP;  Products at thelow-end segment of the fiber optic LAN market cannot use the fullbandwidth potential that fiber offers so vendors stress thesecurity advantages of fiber optics, which are appealing tofederal agencies and the banking community.andP;  The technology is tooexpensive for desktop applications, and it is estimated that onlyfive to 10 percent of the existing Ethernet LANs will convert tofiber.andP;  Most vendors of high-end fiber optic products areconcentrating on LAN-to-LAN connections via FDDI backbones, butthe price of such connections will have to fall to the $7,500 to$10,000 range before FDDI is fully implemented.andP;  Other marketfactors are discussed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Fiber opticsLocal Area NetworksMarket AnalysisFiber Distributed Data Interface StandardPrice.andO;Feature:   illustrationphotographgraph.andO;Caption:   U.S. LAN market.
