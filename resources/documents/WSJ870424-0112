If an insurer sometimes paid too much, that was simply the price of delivering the best possible treatment.    No more. Distressed by the escalating costs of medical care, businesses and the insurance companies that serve them are beginning to shuck the role of passive bill-payer. And as they do so, they are involving themselves ever more deeply in medical decisions, upsetting the traditional doctor-patient relationship and raising difficult questions about medical responsibility.    &quot;We are beginning to get in between the physician and the patient, the patient and the hospital. If you are going to do that, you better do that with the right results,&quot; says Linda Havlin, a benefits consultant with Hewitt Associates in Lincolnshire, Ill.    Many companies are using financial incentives and penalties to steer employees toward doctors and hospitals who agree to provide care for fixed or discounted rates. Southwestern Bell Corp., for example, is setting up a program under which employees will pay virtually nothing if they deal with doctors and hospitals chosen by the company but will have to foot 20% of their bills if they go elsewhere.    Employers and insurers also are trying to control employees who continue to see their own doctors under traditional reimbursement insurance plans. A new program at Sun Co. requires employees to get advance authorization for hospital stays in order to qualify for the maximum reimbursement.    Other companies are requiring employees to get second opinions before having some kinds of surgery, a trend that &quot;undermines the basic doctor-patient relationship,&quot; complains Lonnie Bristow, an internist and official of the American Medical Association.    &quot;There is bound to be some conflict of purpose between a physician whose interest is in the individual patient and the third-party payers whose interest is in the company and its bank account,&quot; Dr. Bristow adds.    Insurers, meanwhile, are dispatching &quot;case managers&quot; to discuss appropriate treatments with some patients and their doctors. And health maintenance organizations, which represent perhaps the best-known attempt to control medical costs, continue to thrive, even as critics contend that the HMO practice of guaranteeing a year's care for a single advance premium encourages member doctors to cut corners unnecessarily.    Sometimes, though, all this extra scrutiny produces happy results for everyone concerned, as it did in the case of David Zoll.    David, a five-year-old Indiana boy, spent the first three years of his life in a hospital. Born prematurely, he had numerous medical problems including a chronic lung condition that left him dependent on a machine to breathe.    Aetna Life andamp; Casualty Co., the Zoll family's insurer, sent a representative to the hospital as part of its case-management program. Having evaluated the case, Aetna arranged to send David home and to pay for equipment and around-the-clock nursing care that wouldn't ordinarily have been covered by the plan purchased by David's father's company.    Aetna estimates that the move home saves $7,000 a month. And while &quot;it's cost-effective for them, it's heart-effective for us,&quot; says Lois Zoll, David's mother. Surrounded by his family, his dog and ordinary household life, David quickly developed more normal sleeping habits and a more cheerful personality, his parents say.    Case management is reserved for the most severe cases; many more employees are being exposed to &quot;utilization review&quot; procedures.    In a typical review plan, the employee or the doctor is asked to call the insurer or a separate review company before a non-emergency hospital stay. The firm evaluates, among other things, the appropriateness of inpatient care and the length of stay the doctor expects.    The doctor is asked to call back if the situation changes and a longer stay is needed. If the patient stays in the hospital beyond the &quot;certified&quot; stay, part or all of the expense may not be paid by the insurance plan.    Utilization review is an area where the quality of service varies widely, providers and others say. Ms. Havlin of Hewitt, who helps businesses select utilization review firms, says the good firms can educate patients about their treatment options and negotiate with doctors to avoid unnecessary surgery or overly long stays in a germ-laden hospital environment.    But on the negative side, she says, &quot;There are firms in the business that are practicing what I call cookbook medicine. If you have an appendectomy, that is X days in the hospital, regardless of your age and your condition.&quot;    This kind of deadline pressure can have appalling results. Janice K. Albert, president of HealthCare Strategies Inc., a Columbia, Md.-based utilization review firm, recently was shocked at the performance of a competing firm. A woman who had had gall bladder surgery four days earlier was vomiting and having other post-operative problems. Nonetheless, her employer's utilization review firm told the doctor that benefits would cease that day. The doctor discharged her.    Ms. Albert's firm, which was working for the employer of the patient's husband, wasn't even planning to talk to the doctor yet about discharging the woman. &quot;To send a patient home like that is just beyond me,&quot; Ms. Albert says. &quot;The utilization review firm was very fortunate she didn't have a real bad complication. They would have ended up with some litigation -- appropriately so.&quot;    The new responsibilities of both bill payers and doctors in such situations was emphasized in a California appellate court ruling last year -- apparently the first litigation involving utilization review. The case, currently on appeal to the state Supreme Court, involved not a corporate plan but California's Medicaid program. Patient Lois J. Wickline sued the state for damages after she underwent surgery for clogged veins, was discharged early, had complications and had to have her right leg amputated.    The appeals court concluded that third-party payers such as businesses and insurers can be held liable &quot;when medically inappropriate decisions result from defects in the design or implementation of cost containment mechanisms.&quot;    But the court found the state of California not liable in this particular case, in part because Ms. Wickline's doctor was &quot;intimidated&quot; and concurred without protest in the early discharge. In such a case, the court ruled, the physician &quot;cannot point to the health care payor as the liability scapegoat when the consequences of his own determinative medical decisions go sour.&quot;    Doctors, while admitting they sometimes bow to pressure from outside reviewers, question whether it is appropriate for third parties to cast them in the role that the California Medical Association calls &quot;agents of rationing.&quot;    The American Medical Association wants all states to pass legislation specifying that payers are subject to legal action when patients suffer because of the unreasonable application of review procedures. Addressing the issue last year, the AMA's policy-making House of Delegates also said doctors are entitled to be paid when &quot;inordinate&quot; amounts of time or effort are required to comply with utilization review programs.    (Utilization review firms usually have physicians of their own on staff or on call, but a doctor's initial contact with a firm may be with a nurse or even a clerk.)    Criticism from doctors and legal risks suggested by the Wickline case are beginning to change the way some employers and insurers look at health-care programs.    &quot;The purchasers of health care are now beginning to ask the question 'Is your focus on cost containment resulting in a trade-off in the area of quality?'&quot; says David J. Ottensmeyer, a physician and a senior vice president of Equicor, an insurance and health care joint venture between Equitable Life Assurance Society of the U.S. and Hospital Corp. of America.    Partly in response to such questions, insurers and others are working to fill a yawning gap -- the lack of objective, statistical data on the quality of care individual doctors and hospitals actually provide. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., for instance, is trying to combine its large data base on medical costs and usage with information on actual patient results from its utilization review program.    Right now, as the next wave of cost-cutting measures hits the health care industry, doctors, patients and insurers have little but anecdotal evidence on which to base decisions about medical care. It may be possible to evaluate health care providers' reputations and credentials, but &quot;we don't know their real batting averages,&quot; says Walter McClure, president of the nonprofit Center for Policy Studies in Minneapolis.    ---   Ms. Slater is a staff reporter in The Wall Street Journal's New York bureau.    ---              Employers Crack Down on Health Costs   Techniques for controlling employee health benefitcosts,by percentage of companies using them    Outpatient surgery                            89%    Preadmission testing                          76    Home health care                              71    Alcohol abuse program                         67    Drug abuse program                            63    Extended care facilities                      58    Non-surgical outpatient care                  56    Hospice care                                  54    Mandatory second surgical opinion program     45    Voluntary second surgical opinion program     45    Monitoring medical services and care          36    Generic drug program                          27    Employee assistance program                   26    Birthing alternatives     (non-hospital maternity care)                25    Disability rehabilitation                     23   Source: Wyatt Co. 1986</TEXT></DOC>
