But as companies increasingly embrace tomorrow'stechnology, they ought to heed yesterday's horror stories aswell.   There's the company, for instance, that bought more bellsand whistles than it needed, or bought stuff that quicklybecame outdated, or never quite figured out how to use whatit bought. For every person who's a virtuoso at Lotus 1-2-3,there's a guy who miscoded an electronic mash note meant forhis sweetheart and sent it to the whole office instead.</LP><TEXT>   Consultants say most of the problems occur becausecorporate buyers don't think through all the issues. Mostcompanies buy systems primarily based on the price of thehardware, but that turns out to be only about 15% of thetotal cost. Training, which gets little attention in budgets,may actually be the biggest cost.   Gil Mann, chief executive officer of Learn-PC VideoSystems, a training company in Minneapolis, says a militaryclient that bought several dozen laptop computers initiallydidn't budget anything for training. More than half themachines, he says, never made it out of their boxes.   Amy Wohl, a consultant in Bala Cynwyd, Pa., says companiesoften try to cut corners on silly things and end up buyingsoftware that lacks crucial features -- such as the abilityto use Postscript typeface technology, which has becomeimportant in desktop publishing.   &quot;People say, `If I buy that other desktop publishingpackage, I'll save $50,'&quot; she says. &quot;I say, `That's thedumbest thing I ever heard. Would you please buy the standardpackage with all the standard features and people who cantrain you to use it, people who can answer your questions?'&quot;   Almost every big company has run into trouble because itbought its personal computers piecemeal; each department wasallowed to buy whatever it wanted. Now, the biggest trendamong users is to hook all the machines together and shareinformation, but many of the software packages can't talkwith each other.   With technology changing so fast, companies have also hadplenty of opportunities to head into blind alleys. TonyBurdick, manager of computer systems at William Blair andamp; Co.,a brokerage firm in Chicago, had everyone using MDBS Inc.'sKnowledgeMan data base. At one time KnowledgeMan was regardedas a powerful package that had a chance of becoming theindustry standard. It faded, however, because MDBS never didmuch to make it easier to use. So Mr. Burdick had to springfor new software and retrain everyone to use a new data base.He says it would take him eight weeks to write a program withKnowledgeMan that he can do in a week with BorlandInternational Ltd.'s Paradox, the software he now uses.   Such problems will get worse before they get better; thereis more confusion than at any other time in recent memoryabout what software will become the industry standard, andanyone who makes the wrong move risks becoming atechnological orphan.   &quot;This is the most confusing time I can remember in theindustry,&quot; Mr. Burdick says.   Even experts are confused or at least exasperated by thebewildering array of changes. Peter McWilliams, author of&quot;The Personal Computer Book,&quot; acknowledges that he oftencan't be bothered with the flood of new software he receives.   &quot;By the time I get around to opening a software package Iwant to use, I may realize there's a new version out,&quot; hesays. &quot;So I put it on the shelf. But by the time I get thenew version, I've lost interest. So I put that on the shelfnext to the old version. I've done this several times.&quot;   Consultants say that's a common problem. As companiesupgrade to the latest version of spreadsheets and collect theolder ones, they find that up to half the boxes thatemployees turn in may be unopened.   And it's not just the constant flow of new software; it'sthe difficulty of understanding it, many experts say. &quot;Ithink software is actually getting harder to use,&quot; saysDonald Norman, a professor of cognitive science at theUniversity of California, San Diego. &quot;Every new release getsmore and more features. And there still is very littleunderstanding in the software business about what it takes tomake a product usable.&quot;   Few people remember it, but Oliver North was tripped uppartly because he didn't understand a piece of software. Whenhe tried to wipe out all the messages he had sent about theIran-Contra affair, he didn't realize that InternationalBusiness Machines Corp.'s PROFs electronic-mail system madean automatic backup, so he left an easy trail forinvestigators to follow.   Even if companies buy all the right stuff, they couldstill blunder. That's because they haven't thought about thebiggest obstacle: people's resistance to change. Eric Vogt,president of MicroMentor, a computer training firm inCambridge, Mass., tells of an executive trying to learn howto use a spreadsheet. The executive initially impressed Mr.Vogt with a complicated spreadsheet that seemed to have everynumber in the right place. Then he realized that theexecutive had done all the work on a hand-held calculator andhad typed all the numbers into the boxes of the spreadsheet.   The problems can be compounded because mistakes happen soquickly and irrevocably with computers. Philippe Kahn, chiefexecutive of Borland, the software company, says he once hitthe wrong key while on a public electronic-mail network andmisaddressed a note that was supposed to go to Borland's headof product development. As a result, he sent a total strangerhis product plans for the following year and a half.   Many issues that seem to be simple technological matterscan also end up causing unintended cultural changes.Electronic mail, for instance, seems to provide a simple wayof improving communication by letting people send notes anddocuments to private computer &quot;mailboxes&quot; instantaneously.One advantage is that people can easily send copies of memosto anyone who might be interested. The problem is that peopledo send copies to everyone who might be interested.   Mr. Norman, the California professor, says he gets 40,000to 50,000 pieces of electronic mail a year, far more than hecan handle. Just sorting through it can easily take more thanan hour a day.   Mr. Kahn says he's always found it intriguing that theJapanese use far fewer personal computers per person thanAmericans and Europeans do -- yet the Japanese economy isconsidered to be much more efficient.   Prof. Norman says that &quot;the good news is that the personalcomputer is catching on in Japan, so maybe they'll finallyslow down.&quot;   ---   Mr. Carroll reports on computers from The Wall StreetJournal's New York bureau.</TEXT></DOC>
