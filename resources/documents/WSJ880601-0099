In federal court here yesterday, Mr. Hunt stressed how &quot;very bullish&quot; he was about silver in the 1970s. Contrary to Minpeco S.A.'s charge of a conspiracy to corner the market, Mr. Hunt, in his cool Texas drawl, said his huge silver investment was a hedge against inflation. And the wild fluctuations in price in late 1979 and early 1980 were caused partly by world events, such as the hostage crisis in Iran and the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.    Mr. Hunt said he began buying in 1973, when silver was $3 an ounce. Seeing what was happening to oil, Mr. Hunt said he wanted &quot;to invest in something I could get my hands on.&quot; By October 1979, the Hunts controlled 100 million ounces of silver, close to 100% of the Commodity Exchange and Chicago Board of Trade warehouse stocks. And by January 1980 the price of silver reached a record $50 an ounce.    &quot;As far as the silver market goes, it was very bullish, almost euphoric, you could say,&quot; said Mr. Hunt, looking at the courtroom spectators, who included his brothers, Lamar and William Herbert, and his wife.    In the next week or so, each of the brothers is expected to testify for the first time since the court battle with Minpeco, the leading Peruvian mineral company, began more than three months ago. Claiming it lost about $200 million in the rise and collapse of silver prices, Minpeco contends that the Hunts committed fraud and violated commodities and antitrust laws as well as federal racketeering laws. Minpeco, which is owned by the Peruvian government, is seeking $148 million in damages from the Hunts and other individuals named in the suit.    The brothers -- Nelson Bunker, 62 years old, William Herbert, 59, and Lamar, 55 -- are among the heirs of H.L. Hunt, the eccentric billionaire who died in 1974, leaving trust funds and oil properties. But in recent years, they have been struggling to retain the remnants of their fortunes, depleted largely by the 1980 silver crisis. In March 1980, when the silver market tumbled, the Hunt brothers had losses in the billions of dollars.    Among their holdings is Placid Oil Co., long considered the corporate jewel, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection in 1986. The brothers' trusts are also in Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings. Through their trusts, the brothers control Penrod Drilling Co., which owns one of the largest offshore drilling fleets in the world.    During the trial, an attorney for Minpeco disclosed that the Hunts had offered to settle. But the terms of the $20 million offer were unacceptable to Minpeco. Paul J. Curran, the lead attorney for the Hunts, said he had no comment about any settlement talks.    Minpeco already has obtained $64.7 million in pretrial settlements from six other defendants, including E.F. Hutton andamp; Co., Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., and AML Futures Inc., a now defunct unit of Donaldson, Lufkin andamp; Jenrette Inc. </TEXT></DOC>
