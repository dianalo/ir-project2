Radiation therapy has come to have a major role in themanagement of patients with squamous carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, and largecell carcinoma. Resectable patients who have regional lymph node metastasesbenefit from postoperative irradiation. For those with unresectable tumors,radiation therapy is the only definitive, potentially curative treatment.Control of the intrathoracic tumor is a major determinant of survivalin these patients, so all efforts to achieve maximum control of the localregional tumor are justified. The most important determinant of controlof the intrathoracic tumor is the biologic dose of radiations. In patientswith small cell carcinoma, chemotherapy employing at least three effectivedrugs is an essential part of the management. Prophylactic cranial irradiationreduces the frequency of brain metastasis although extracranial CNS metastasesmay still occur. Thoracic irradiation increases the probability of controllingthe tumor that is usually most bulky and it increases long-term survival.Patients with cancer of the lung of any histopathologic type benefitfrom palliative irradiation of metastases that produce pain or compromisevital structures. Initial performance status is the single most importantprognostic factor in patients with carcinoma of the lung. Prognosis hasimproved during the last decade for patients with inoperable tumors asa result of improvement in radiotherapeutic technique and the use ofsystemic chemotherapy for small cell carcinoma.</TEXT></DOC>
