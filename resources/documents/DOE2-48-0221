The modular approach aimsto maximize the use of ``off-the-shelf'' and readily available components.A key feature is the replacement of the conventional purpose-designedhydroelectric turbine by a pump used in reverse as a turbine with fixedblades and vanes. Other features are the use of siphon penstocks, inductiongenerators, prefabricated structures, and automated control equipment.The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority contractedwith Acres International Corporation to study two small hydro projectsdesigned and built using the modular approach, and compare each one withan equivalent conventional design. Equipment procurement and installationcosts, general construction costs, and energy production were estimated.Economic analyses were prepared. Preliminary data on operation and maintenancewas recorded. The methodology and results of the study are containedin this report. 18 figs., 20 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
