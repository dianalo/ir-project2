Someanalysts fear that tighter credit will inhibit Japanesebuying at this week's big U.S. Treasury refunding auctions.   To ward off the inflationary effects of higher oil prices,economists say, the Bank of Japan is likely to boost itsdiscount rate, which it charges on loans to financialinstitutions. Most economists expect the increase to come asearly as this week, in light of the jump in world oil pricesfollowing Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;This is the last nail in the coffin of the currentinterest-rate structure,&quot; said Kermit L. Schoenholtz, aneconomist at Salomon Brothers Inc. here. Added anotheranalyst at a U.S. securities firm: &quot;This is probably just theexcuse {Bank of Japan Governor Yasushi} Mieno has beenlooking for.&quot;   If rates in Japan rise, economists worry that thecountry's big institutional investors, who normally are majorbuyers at U.S. Treasury auctions, may decide to keep theirmoney at home, where it will earn more in interest and won'tbe exposed to foreign-exchange market gyrations.   Even before the invasion, Japan's financial markets werewarily anticipating tighter credit. Last week, commercialbanks effectively raised their prime lending rates, andgovernment bond yields crept higher.   Then came the Iraqi invasion. The ensuing volatility inoil's price whipsawed Japan's already-jittery markets. OnFriday, the Nikkei average of 225 stocks plummeted 729.42points to 29515.76, its first time below the 30000 mark inmore than three months. The No. 119 10-year government bonddropped 0.54 to 84.76 to yield 7.15%, up 0.1 percentagepoint.   Late Sunday, Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu overrode theopposition of the powerful Ministry of International Tradeand Industry to join ranks with the U.S. and the EuropeanCommunity in imposing an international trade embargo againstIraq.   By joining the trade embargo, Japan risks 700 billion yen($4.67 billion) of commercial and other loans outstanding toBaghdad, but the overall economic effects would hardly becrippling. Unlike the two previous oil crises, the countrywouldn't face a shortage of supply by cutting off Iraq, evenif it also loses supplies from occupied Kuwait. In the firstsix months of the year, Japan imported about 220,000 barrelsa day from each country, or a total of about 12% of its oilimports. Although Japan imports 99% of its oil, 70% of itfrom the Middle East, the country has a strategic reservethat could supply the nation at full capacity for nearly fivemonths.   In the 1973 oil crisis, a sudden embargo on oil by theOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries resulted in aquadrupling of world oil prices and severe inflation inJapan. At the time, Japan was importing five million barrelsa day, and the cost of crude was the equivalent of almost 5%of gross national product. In 1979, when oil prices suddenlydoubled, oil dependency was only marginally less.   Today, however, although Japan still consumes one in 10barrels of the world's oil, its oil bill accounts for lessthan 1% of GNP, about the same as in the U.S. and less thanother industrialized countries, including West Germany. Itsdependence on oil for energy has dropped to 58% in 1989 from78% in 1973. Even a long-term increase in crude prices to $21a barrel, about $5 more than prices a month ago, would raiseconsumer prices in Japan only about 0.08 percentage point,according to Nomura Research Institute, an arm of NomuraSecurities Co.   Some analysts argue that a higher import bill couldbenefit Japan by trimming its persistent trade surpluses andcooling industrial expansion. UBS-Phillips andamp; DrewInternational Ltd. predicted that a $5-a-barrel increase inoil prices would shave Japan's trade surplus by 10% a year.   The risk to Japan's economy, analysts say, really lies inthe credit policy of the Bank of Japan. Mr. Mieno is knownfor his anxiety about repeating the mistakes that allowedinflation to rage at 25% after the first oil crisis in 1973.   It would be the fifth official tightening of credit sinceMay 1989, when the discount rate stood at a historic low of2.5%. The rate now is 5.25%.   In Japan, higher rates would tend to damp consumerspending and capital investment by big companies. Buteconomists say the economy appears healthy enough towithstand another rate rise.   The greater threat of higher Japanese rates may lieabroad. As rates on Japanese government bonds trend higher,rates in the U.S., where the economy is showing signs ofslowing fast, are likely to weaken, making U.S. bonds lookless attractive to big Japanese investors, economists say.   That could create problems for the U.S. Treasury, whichplans to try to raise $32.25 billion this week at auctionsTuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. If Japanese investors, whonormally take up about a third of the total, aren'taggressive bidders, interest rates in the U.S. may creep up.&quot;What will determine the auction is exchange rates,&quot; saidHirohiko Okumura, chief economist at Nomura ResearchInstitute. He believes that if the dollar is strong againstthe yen, investors will steer clear of dollar-denominatedinvestments such as U.S. Treasurys out of a long-term viewthat the currency will weaken.</TEXT></DOC>
