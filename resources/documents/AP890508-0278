The contract for June delivery of West Texas Intermediate, thebenchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, fell 58 cents to $19.44 a barrelon the New York Mercantile Exchange.   That was the lowest close for a near-month contract since March14, when the contract for April delivery settled at $19.29 a barrel.   Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesboosted their production last month to 20.9 million barrels a day,the authoritative Petroleum Intelligence Weekly reported Monday.   OPEC's self-imposed quota is 18.5 million barrels a day.   The oil futures market was hit by the overproduction report andby technicians who concluded from price charts that the market wasin a downtrend, said Mary Haskins of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.   Traders who bought contracts in hopes of a price rise sold them,while others sold borrowed contracts in the expectation of a freshdecline, she said.   The selling in the crude market spread to the market for refinedproducts.   The June contract for unleaded gasoline dropped 2.52 cents to64.98 cents a gallon, a decline of close to 4 percent, even steeperthan the less than 3 percent drop in crude oil.   Heavy selling of unleaded gasoline futures had taken holdFriday, when the June contract had fallen 2.12 cents. Ms. Haskinssaid technical traders led the charge. ``The bloom is off the rosefor gasoline,'' she said.   The contract for No.2 heating oil fell .68 cent to 46.69 cents agallon.   The downward moves of Friday and Monday were a sharp reversalfrom the previous two sessions, when prices surged after anannouncement that repairs on a North Sea oil platform would takelonger than expected.   Brent crude production in the North Sea may be disrupted untilthe end of May, officials said last week.</TEXT></DOC>
