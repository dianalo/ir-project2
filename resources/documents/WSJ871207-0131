A year earlier, the company earned $599,000, or 11 cents a share, on sales of $7.9 million.    Galileo said soft demand for the fiber-optic products may continue in its fiscal second quarter. It didn't elaborate.    Galileo makes fiber-optic systems used in military night-vision applications, and scientific and commercial products.    In national over-the-counter trading Friday, Galileo shares closed at $7.50, down 25 cents.    (Revised WSJ Dec. 9, 1987)</TEXT></DOC>
