But even deeper cuts are expected later this year afterconsultant Deloitte andamp; Touche completes a study comparing thehuge Sears headquarters bureaucracy -- more than 10,000employees, including some in regional offices -- to those ofits competitors. &quot;Clearly there won't be enough jobs foreveryone,&quot; Chairman Edward A. Brennan told employees in avideotape.</LP><TEXT>   The latest move brings to 40,500 the number of jobs Searshas eliminated since August 1990, when Mr. Brennan reassumedthe top retail post and vowed to revive sales and profit. Theearlier reductions, however, focused primarily on hourlyworkers and part-timers.   Sears is now eliminating an entire layer of management --roughly 70 middle managers in all -- who supervise districtmanagers and who each earn about $150,000 annually. Theirstaffs also will disappear by mid-April, as will the jobs ofsome district managers who currently oversee operations atsmall groups of stores and report to the regional managers.In addition, Sears is shrinking its inventory managementstaff and consolidating operations in Chicago by early nextyear.   By closing all 10 regional offices and 26 of 72 districtoffices, Sears estimated it will save $50 million annually,beginning next year. That's the same level of savings Searsforecast in January, when it announced the elimination of6,900 store-level jobs, many of them part-time posts.   &quot;Our cost reduction programs to date have improved ourbottom line by reducing our ratio of selling, general andadministrative expenses to revenues,&quot; Mr. Brennan said in anews release. &quot;But we need to do much more to be successfulin this highly competitive environment.&quot;   Expenses consumed 29 cents of every dollar of Sears U.S.retail sales in 1991 -- down from 30 cents in 1990. But itsoverhead is still higher than that of many competitors.Expenses consume less than 16 cents of every revenue dollarat Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the discounter that recentlyunseated Sears as the nation's largest retailer.   In late composite trading on the New York Stock Exchange,Sears shares slipped 25 cents and were quoted at $44.25 ashare.   Analysts generally praised the further cost cutting. &quot;Iapplaud their efforts to make their structure lower cost andmore efficient,&quot; said Edward Weller, an analyst at MontgomerySecurities. But Margo McGlade of PaineWebber Inc. said thatshe is &quot;still waiting for Sears stores to be competitive inthe marketplace in appearance, product selection, pricing andservice.&quot;   Sears didn't provide details of the sales staffcompensation changes that will go into effect March 1. Thecompany said only that in an attempt to cut costs it willstandardize commissions and align them with those paid bycompetitors. A spokesman said the company expects additionalsavings from the compensation changes, but declined toquantify them.</TEXT></DOC>
