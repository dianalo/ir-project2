<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-19-1164 </DOCNO><TEXT>In 1985, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) sought toregulate rail shipments of spent nuclear fuel through the state, becausefederal regulations did not adequately protect the environmentally sensitivecorridor along the route of the shipments. A state interagency workinggroup identified five serious deficiencies in the overall federal regulatoryscheme: 1) failure to consider the safety or environmental risks associatedwith selected routes; 2) absence of route-specific emergency responseplanning; 3) failure of the NRC to regulate the carrier of spent nuclearfuel or consider its safety record; 4) absence of requirements for determinationof need for, or the propriety of, specific shipments of spent nuclearfuel; and 5) the lack of any opportunity for meaningful public participationwith respect to the decision to transport spent nuclear fuel. The stateis now proposing federal legislation which would require: 1) NRC determinationof need prior to approval of offsite shipment of spent fuel by licensees;2) NRC assessment of the potential environmental impacts of shipmentsalong the proposed route, and a comparative evaluation of alternativemodes and routes; and 3) NRC approval of a route-specific emergency responseand mitigation plan, including local training and periodic exercises.Additionally, the proposed legislation would authorize States and IndianTribes to establish regulatory programs providing for permits, inspection,contingency plans for monitoring, containment, cleanup and decontamination,surveillance, enforcement and reasonable fees.</TEXT></DOC>
