Dane, Chief, Officeof Scientific Authority, at the above address (phone 703-358-1708 or FTS921-1708).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>The argali sheep (<T3>Ovis ammon</T3>) is a relative of the North American bighorn sheep(<T3>Ovis canadensis</T3>). It is found in mountainous parts of CentralAsia, including Kazakhstan, southern Siberia, northern and western China,Tibet, Nepal, and northern India. As many as 17 subspecies have been recognized(Nadler <T3>et al. </T3>1973).In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of June 14, 1976 (41 FR 24064), the U.S. Fishand Wildlife Service (Service) classified the subspecies <T3>Ovis ammon hodgsoni </T3>as endangered. This listing was in responseto a petition requesting endangered classification for all taxa that werealready on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in EndangeredSpecies of Wild Fauna and Flora, but that then were not on the U.S. Listsof Endangered and Threatened Wildlife and Plants.According to some authorities, such as Ellerman and Morrison-Scott (1966)and Nadler <T3>et al. </T3>(1973), the subspecies <T3>O. a. hodgsoni </T3>is found in the Himalayan region and parts of theChinese province of Xizang (Tibet), while another subspecies, <T3>O. a. dalailamae, </T3>occurs farther north and east in the Chineseprovinces of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, and Sichuan. Other authorities,including Pfeffer (1967) and Valdez (1982) consider <T3>O. a. dalailamae </T3>to be only a synonym of <T3>O.a. hodgsoni, </T3>and thus the range of the latter actually includesthat of the former. In the U.S. List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife,the range of <T3>hodgsoni </T3>is given as ``China (Tibet, Himalayas).''As pointed out in the notice by the Service's Division of Law Enforcement,in this same issue of the <T4>Federal Register, </T4>a recent legal action involved the importationof trophies of argali sheep killed in Gansu Province. In the course ofthis action, a dispute arose as to whether the trophies represented <T3>O. a. hodgsoni. </T3>The Service eventually concluded that the trophieswere properly identified as <T3>hodgsoni.</T3>The Service now is considering changes to the List of Endangered and ThreatenedWildlife, so that the range of <T3>O. a. hodgsoni </T3>is fully and accurately delineated, and that anyappropriate synonyms are taken into account. The Service also has receivedinformation suggesting that additional subspecies of <T3>O. ammon, </T3>including both possible synonyms of <T3>hodgsoni </T3>and other subspecies, are of serious bioconservationconcern and may warrant U.S. classification as endangered or threatened.The International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resourcescurrently classifies the entire species <T3>O. ammon </T3>as ``indeterminate,'' meaning that it is known to qualifyfor one of that organization's categories of ``endangered'', ``vulnerable,''or ``rare,'' but that information is not yet sufficient to determine whichdesignation is most appropriate. In order to help clarify the situationand resolve its own listing questions, the Service now solicits relevantdata, comments, and publications dealing with the taxonomy, distribution,and bioconservation status of all subspecies of <T3>O. ammon.</T3><ITAG tagnum="74">Literature Cited</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">Ellerman, J.R., and T.C.S.
