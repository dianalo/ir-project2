The public reporting burden for each of these collectionsof information is estimated to include the time for reviewing the instructions,searching existing data sources, gathering and maintaining the data needed,and completing and reviewing the collection of information. Informationon the estimated public reporting burden is provided under the heading<T3>Other Matters.</T3> Send comments regarding this burden estimate orany other aspect of this collection of information, including suggestionsfor reducing this burden, to the Department of Housing and Urban Development,Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC20410; and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503.<ITAG tagnum="84">I. Background and Procedural Matters</ITAG>The McKinney Act authorized the SAFAH program to provide two categoriesof assistance: (1) Assistance to cover the costs in excess of assistanceprovided under the Emergency Shelter Grants and the Supportive HousingDemonstration programs that are required to meet the special needs of certainhomeless populations or to facilitate the transfer and use of public buildingsto assist the homeless; or (2) comprehensive assistance for particularlyinnovative programs for, or alternative methods of, meeting the immediateand long-term needs of the homeless. Section 433 of the McKinney Act requiredHUD to establish by <T4>Federal Register</T4> notice the guidelines for governing SAFAH. HUDpublished the guidelines on October 19, 1987 (52 FR 38880) (the SAFAH guidelines).Section 485 of the 1988 Amendments Act requires that HUD publish, within60 days of its enactment, a notice for immediate effect describing thechanges to the SAFAH guidelines made by the Act. In addition to the changesfor immediate effect necessitated by the 1988 Amendments Act, HUD is proposingin this notice two changes to the guidelines, which will not be effectiveuntil public comment has been received and considered.The 1988 Amendments Act also requires HUD to issue a final rule not laterthan 12 months after enactment based on the guidelines and the changesto the guidelines established in this notice. HUD invites the public tocomment on the guidelines, the changes for immediate effect, and the proposedchanges announced in this notice for consideration in the final rulemaking.Interested persons should refer to the October 19, 1987 guidelines (52FR 38880) in order to understand the changes described in this notice withinthe context of those guidelines.No funds are available for obligation for SAFAH for FY 1989 as of the dateof this notice. When funds become available in the future, HUD will publisha Notice of Funds Availability and will invite eligible applicants to applyfor assistance under the program.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan</ITAG>SAFAH assistance may not be provided to or within the jurisdiction of aState or an ESG formula city or county (defined in section A of the SAFAHguidelines), unless the jurisdiction (or jurisdictions, where necessary)has a HUD-approved Comprehensive Homeless Assistance Plan (CHAP). On December28, 1988, HUD published a notice announcing the current requirements forHUD approval of a CHAP as a result of the 1988 Amendments Act (53 FR 52600).Readers should familiarize themselves with the CHAP requirements.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. 1988 Amendments Act Changes to SAFAH Guidelines</ITAG>1. <T3>Assistance provided. </T3>Section 461(1) of the 1988 Amendments Actis a technical amendment to clarify that assistance is available to providesupportive services to the homeless in the category of assistance in excessof ESG and SHD program funding (see section B.1.(ii) of the SAFAH guidelines).The term ``supportive services'' is defined in section A of the SAFAH guidelines.In the category of comprehensive assistance (section B.1.(i) of the SAFAHguidelines), section 461(2) of the 1988 Amendments Act authorizes assistancefor the operation of facilities to assist the homeless, in addition toassistance for the purchase, lease, rehabilitation, or conversion of thefacilities. Operating expenses are those that a recipient incurs for administration,maintenance, minor or routine repair, security, utilities, fuel, furnishings,equipment, and rental of the housing. The term does not include expensesthat a recipient incurs for debt service in connection with a loan usedto finance acquisition or rehabilitation costs under the program.2. <T3>Site control. </T3>Section 463 of the 1988 Amendments Act providesthat an application for assistance must furnish reasonable assurances thatthe applicant will own or have control of a site for the proposed projectnot later than six months after notification of an award for assistance.Under the SAFAH guidelines (sections E.2.(i)(b)(3)(<T3>c</T3>) and E.3.(i)(b)(4)(<T3>c</T3>)), applicants were required to demonstrate control of a siteat the time of the application for assistance. This amendment will permitapplications to be made for projects that are not able to gain controlof a site until they have been notified of an award for assistance. ``Reasonableassurances'' must be satisfied by identification of a suitable site (asuitable site is one that meets the threshold requirements applicable tosites in sections E.2.(i) and E.3.(i) of the guidelines) and:(a) Certification that the applicant is engaged in negotiations or in otherefforts for the purpose of gaining control of the identified site; or(b) Other evidence satisfactory to HUD showing that the applicant willgain control of the identified site.Section 463 also provides that an applicant may obtain ownership or controlof a suitable site different from the one specified in its application.Retention of an assistance award is subject to the new site's meeting allrequirements for suitable sites. If the acquisition or rehabilitation costsfor the substitute site are more than the amount of the advance or grant,the recipient must furnish all additional costs. If the recipient is unableto demonstrate to HUD that it has the ability to furnish the differencein costs, HUD may recapture the obligated funds and reallocate the fundsto other projects.If a recipient does not have control of the site within one year afternotification of an award for assistance, section 463 requires HUD to recapturethe obligated funds and reallocate the funds to other projects.This provision applies to all future applicants for SAFAH assistance, aswell as to any recipients that were notified of awards on or after November1, 1987 and whose funds were later deobligated by HUD upon learning therecipient no longer had ownership or control of the site specified in itsapplication or that the recipient wanted to change to a site differentfrom the site specified in its application.3. <T3>Environmental review. </T3>Section 443 provides that the provisionsof, and regulators and procedures applicable under, section 104(g) of theHousing and Community Development Act of 1974 (42 U.S.C. 5304(g)) shallapply to assistance and projects under Title IV of the McKinney Act. Section104(g) provides that, in lieu of the environmental protection proceduresotherwise applicable, the Secretary may provide for the release of fundsfor particular projects to grantees who assume all the responsibilitiesfor environmental review, decisionmaking, and action under the NationalEnvironmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4321) (NEPA) and the otherprovisions of law that would apply to the Secretary were the Secretaryto undertake such projects as Federal projects. HUD regulations implementingsection 104(g) are found in 24 CFR Part 58, and the Secretary has specifiedthe other provisions of law under which environmental responsibilitiesare to be assumed by grantees in 24 CFR 58.5. (These authorities includethe floodplain restrictions discussed in III.4.) As applied to SAFAH, the Department views section 443 as authorizing theSecretary to require States, metropolitan cities, urban counties, tribes,or other governmental entities with general purpose governmental powersto assume the responsibility for assessing the environmetal effects ofeach application for assistance in accordance with the procedural provisionsof NEPA, the related environmental laws and authorities, and HUD's implementingregulations in 24 CFR Part 58. In accordance with the new statutory authorization,HUD will, in connection with future SAFAH grants, provide for assumptionof these responsibilities by jurisdictions with general governmental powersthat are deemed to have the legal capacity to assume the responsibilities.This policy will <T3>not </T3>be applied to advances or grants made to governmental entitieswith <T3>special </T3>or <T3>limited purpose </T3>powers or to <T3>provide nonprofit organizations. </T3>HUD will continue to performthe environmental review for these entities in accordance with 24 CFR Part50, to the extent required. Relevant reviews completed for purposes ofanother McKinney Act program or other HUD programs may suffice for purposesof SAFAH, where permitted under Part 58. An applicant with general purpose governmental powers that believes thatit does not have the legal capacity to carry out the environmental responsibilitiesrequired by 25 CFR Part 58 should contact the appropriate HUD Field Officefor further instructions. Determinations of legal capacity will be madeon a case-by-case basis. With respect to applications for which the applicant will be responsiblefor performing the environmental review under section 104(g) and 24 CFRPart 58, the environmental review process will be independent of the thresholdrequirements and selection process, and the applicant may complete theenvironmental review after those processes and after selection for funding.Therefore, the provisions of sections E.2(i)(b)(3)(<T3>c</T3>) and E.3(i)(b)(4)(<T3>c</T3>) of the SAFAH guidelines that concern historic preservationrequirements, as well as sections E.2(iii) and E.3(iii) of the SAFAH guidelines,will not apply to those applications, and HUD will not consider environmentalimpacts or time delays associated with mitigation measures for such proposalsin selecting such applications. Similarly, since under sections E.2(iii)and E.3(iii) of the SAFAH guidelines, an application that requires an EnvironmentalImpact Statement (EIS) will not be eligible for funding, this provisionwill be applied only to the applications for which HUD performs the environmentalreview. HUD will not enforce this provision where the applicant performsthe environmental review, and after finding that an EIS is necessary, choosesto prepare the EIS. On August 10, 1988, HUD amended its environmental regulations at 24 CFRParts 50 and 58 to exclude certain activities under HUD homeless assistanceprograms from the NEPA requirements of Parts 50 and 58 (53 FR 30186). (Theamendments were published in conjunction with HUD's final rule governingthe Emergency Shelter Grants Program.) These ``categorical exclusions''from NEPA review are for activities that HUD believes lack potential significanteffect on the human environment. Specifically, the activities consist ofsuch services as health, substance abuse and counseling services, the provisionof meals and payment of rent, utility and maintenance costs, and similaractivities that do not involve physical change to buildings or sites. Environmentalreview focuses on new site selection and physical development activitiessuch as construction, property rehabilitation, renovation, and conversion.Although the activities described above and certain other activities maybe categorically excluded from the NEPA requirements, they are not excludedfrom the individual compliance requirements of other environmental statutes,executive orders, and HUD standards listed in andSection;andSection; 50.4 and58.5, where applicable. However, activities consisting solely of supportiveservices and software normally do not require environemtal review underNEPA <T3>or </T3>the related authorities if they do not directly require physicaldevelopment or site selection (<T3>i.e., </T3>use of a building not previously used for purposes of thisprogram). Activities that trigger neither NEPA nor the related authoritiesare defined as ``exempt'' under Part 58. Where applicants exercise environmentalreview under section 104(g) and Part 58, procedures for applicant submissionof environmental certifications and Requests for Release of Funds applyto new site selection and to the funding of physical development activities.These procedures do not apply to activities that are determined and documentedto be ``exempt.'' Applicants and grantees are cautioned that under section 104(g), HUD maynot release SAFAH funds for a project if the grantee, a subgrantee, oranother party commits SAFAH funds (<T3>i.e., </T3>incurs any costs or expenditures to be paid for or reimbursedwith such funds) before the grantee submits its request for release ofSAFAH funds to HUD. 4. <T3>Floodplain restrictions. </T3>Section 451 of the 1988 Amendments Actrequires that the flood protection standards for housing acquired, rehabilitated,or assisted with Supportive Housing Demonstration funds may be no morerestrictive than those applicable under Executive Order 11988, FloodplainManagement (May 24, 1977) to the other programs under Title IV of the McKinneyAct. HUD has determined that this provision should be applied to the SAFAHprogram as well. Therefore, the restrictions with respect to location ofprojects in floodplains contained in sections E.2(i)(b)(3)(<T3>c</T3>) and E.3(i)(b)(4)(<T3>c</T3>) of the SAFAH guidelines will no longer apply to projects assistedunder SAFAH. HUD interprets Section 451 to mean that, for projects locatedin floodplains, the eight-step process of public notification and decisionmakingoutlined in the U.S. Water Resources Council Floodplain Management Guidelines(43 FR 6030, February 10, 1978) must be undertaken before any decisionis made on the environmental acceptability of the project site for homelessassistance. Grantees will perform the eight-step process whenever theyassume other environmental review responsibilities (see section III.3),doing so during the environmental review process. The eight-step process applies to all applications for projects withinthe 100-year floodplain and, for critical actions, the 500-year floodplain.Critical actions are defined as those projects intended to serve developmentallydisabled, chronically mentally ill, or mobility imparied residents. Applicantswith proposed projects located in a floodplain should be aware that thepublic notification and decisionmaking period takes a minimum of 30 daysfrom the time the first published notice in the process appears. WhereHUD will carry out the process, applicants may be required to provide engineeringand structural information (<T3>e.g., </T3>elevations and data) in order to permit HUD to undertakeits analysis. If HUD is unable to make a floodplains determination within60 days from the date it publishes the first notice (where HUD has theresponsibility for carrying out the eight-step process), and the applicanthas not provided the HUD-requested information in a timely manner, theapplication will be rejected.Executive Order 11988 requires HUD or the applicant (where it assumes environmentalreview responsibilities) to consider alternatives to avoid adverse impactsassociated with the occupancy and modification of floodplains. The alternativesmay include actions resulting in less risk to human life or property. Thereview process may result in specific mitigation requirements or rejectionof the site or application for assistance. As part of the eight-step process,HUD or the applicant must reevaluate alternatives to projects/sites locatedin floodplains and, where HUD performs the process, HUD will assign a higherenvironmental rating to applications with less hazardous sites. If, afterinitial approval, an applicant changes the site, any new site will be subjectto a complete environmental review, including, as applicable, the eight-steppublic notification and decisionmaking procedure for sites located in floodplains.The Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973 (42 U.S.C. 4128) and HUD regulationsprohibit the approval of applications for projects/sites located in anarea identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as havingspecial flood hazards, unless: (1) The community in which the area is situatedis participating in the National Flood Insurance Program (not suspendedor withdrawn) (see 44 (CFR Parts 59-79) or less than a year has passedsince FEMA notification regarding such hazards; and (2) flood insuranceis obtained as a condition of approval of the application.Applicants with projects/sites (determined through the eight-step processto be environmentally acceptable) that are located in an area that hasbeen identified by FEMA as having special flood hazards will be requiredto obtain and maintain flood insurance under the National Flood InsuranceProgram. This is a separate requirement from the Executive Order 11988procedures, and the availability of flood insurance does not satisfy theeight-step public notification and decisionmaking procedure of the FloodplainManagement Guidelines.5. <T3>Drug- and alcohol-free facilities. </T3>Section 402 of the 1988 AmendmentsAct requires grantees, recipients, and project sponsors under each of thehomeless housing programs authorized by Title IV of the McKinney Act toadminister, in good faith, a policy designed to ensure that the homelessfacility is free from the illegal use, possession, or distribution of drugsor alcohol by its beneficiaries. For more information concerning this requirement,potential applicants are encouraged to read the notice on ComprehensiveHomeless Assistance Plans, published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>on December 28, 1988 (53 FR 52600).IV. Proposed Changes to SAFAH Guidelines1. <T3>Outpatient health services. </T3>The definition of ``outpatient healthservices'' in section A of the SAFAH guidelines would be changed to excludeoutpatient substance abuse services. HUD believes these services are adequatelycovered under the definition of ``supportive services.''2. <T3>Ranking criteria for comprehensive assistance. </T3>An additional rankingfactor on cost-effectiveness would be included for applications for comprehensiveassistance (see section E.2.(ii) of the SAFAH guidelines). (This rankingfactor is already included for applications for excess assistance (seesection E.3.(ii)(c).) Under the cost-effectiveness factor for comprehensiveassistance, HUD would consider the extent to which the applicant's proposedcosts under the proposal are reasonable in relation to the work done andthe goods and services purchased, and are effective in accomplishing thepurposes of the proposal.V. Other MattersThe collection of information requirements contained in this Notice andin the SAFAH guidelines were submitted to OMB for review under section3504(h) of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. Section III of this noticehas been determined by the Department to contain new collection of informationrequirements not included in the Department's assessment of the burdenof these requirements when it was originally approved by OMB. Informationon the reporting burden is provided as follows:<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>5,L2,b2,tp0,p6,6/7,i1,s10,6,6,6,6</C> <H1> </H1><H1>Number of respondents</H1><H1>Frequency of response</H1><H1>Hours per response</H1><H1>Burden hours</H1>Applications:<ITAG tagnum="2">Comprehensive<D>250</D><D>1</D><D>100</D><D>25,000</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="2">Supplemental<D>30</D><D>1</D><D>52</D><D>1,560</D><R>n,sandCx.3;</R></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="3">Total annual burden</ITAG><D/><D/><D/><D>26,560</D></ITAG>A Finding of No Significant Impact with respect to the environment hasbeen made in accordance with HUD regulations in 24 CFR Part 50, which implementsection 102(2)(C) of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969, 42U.S.C. 4332. The Finding is available for public inspection during regularbusiness hours at the Office of Rules Docket Clerk, Room 10276, Departmentof Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh Street SW., Washington, DC20410.The General Counsel, as the designated official under Executive Order 12606,<T3>The Family, </T3>has determined that the changes to the SAFAH programannounced in this Notice will not have a potential significant impact onthe formation, maintenance, and general well-being of participating homelessfamilies. The changes are either procedural or of little substantial significance.In addition, the Notice announces statutorily imposed requirements overwhich HUD has little or no implementing discretion.The General Counsel has also determined, as the Designated Official forHUD under section 6(a) of Executive Order 12612, <T3>Federalism, </T3>that the amendment made by section 443 of the 1988Amendments Act will have federalism implications. That section providesthat HUD shall apply the provisions of, and regulations and proceduresapplicable under, section 104(g) of the Housing and Community DevelopmentAct of 1974 to assistance and projects under Title IV of the McKinney Act.Section 104(g) provides that the Secretary may require applicants withthe legal capacity to do so to assume the responsibilities for environmentalreview, decisionmaking, and action under the National Environmental PolicyAct of 1969 and the other provisions of law specified by the Secretarythat would apply to HUD were HUD to undertake such projects as Federalprojects. HUD is announcing in this notice that it will require Statesand other governmental entities with general governmental powers to assumethose responsibilities. While the delegation of these responsibilitiesunder section 104(g) is discretionary with HUD, it is authorized by, andclearly the intent of, section 443 of the 1988 Amendments Act. Therefore,the policy is not subject to further review under Executive Order 12612.This document was not listed on the Department's Semiannual Agenda of Regulationspublished on October 24, 1988 (53 FR 41974).<ITAG tagnum="21">The Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number is 14.510.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: January 4, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Kenneth J.
