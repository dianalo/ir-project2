'</NOTE><BYLINE>By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government charged today that cash, jewelry,fine wines and fruits were given to the nation's former chief lawenforcement officer by defendants in the influence-peddling trialof Leonid I. Brezhnev's son-in-law.   As the trial before a three-member military tribunal entered itssecond day, prosecutors alleged defendants gave former InteriorMinister Nikolai Shchelokov, then the Soviet Union's top policeofficer and a protege of Brezhnev, gifts ranging from neckties tothree pearls valued at $5,300 each.   The indictment, which is being read in court, said Shchelokovwas picky about the gifts he accepted and often refused things thatdidn't suit him.   The charges provided the most detailed account yet of officialcorruption at the top levels of the Brezhnev regime.   Recent newspaper reports say Shchelokov took $1.1 million instate funds, gave foreign luxury cars to his children and boughtfurs and crystal chandeliers for himself and his family.   He was fired by Brezhnev's successor, Yuri Andropov, and died inDecember 1984 at age 73. Shchelokov and his wife are said to havecommitted suicide, and the indictment read today confirmed theformer interior minister did indeed kill himself.   The court documents said boxes of money were left onShchelekov's desk and that one of the nine defendants gave him105,000 rubles ($170,000).   ``He wanted good, dry wines,'' the indictment said, adding thatthe defendants obliged him. Six times a year, shipments from theCentral Asian republic of Uzbekistan would arrive at a Moscowairport and be taken to Shchelekov's country home outside thecapital.   The indictment said the shipments contained cognac, tomatoes aswell as melons, apricots and other fruits unobtainable in Moscowmost of the year.   When he received gifts he liked, the account said, the interiorminister would politely accept them by saying, ``I thank you.''   Sometimes, however, he refused to take things he didn't want.   According to the indictment, Shchelekov once was taken to afactory in Uzbekistan and offered clothes and other products madethere. He reportedly declined and asked instead for a piece ofjewelry for his wife.   The central figure among the nine defendants, 51-year-old YuriChurbanov, was Shchelokov's deputy and could face the death penaltyif convicted on charges he accepted bribes and gifts such as wine,cognac and grapes flown to him via the Soviet airline Aeroflot fromUzbekistan.   One defendant was out sick today, and two others were treated bya doctor in the courtroom.   A judge at the military tribunal announced that KhushvanNorbutaev would not attend today's session, and the defendant'slawyer, Olga Rakitina, said the former regional police chief fromUzbekistan was suffering from angina pectoris, a painful but notnecessarily dangerous heart condition.   She sought a recess, saying her client was entitled to heareverything that goes on in court, but the judge rejected therequest and a clerk then continued reading the indictment.   A physician later gave heart medicine to another defendant,Tashtimir Kakhramanov, and administered stomach pills to D.Dzhamalov.   The trial is considered part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's effort toseparate his leadership from the corruption of Brezhnev's rule,which began in 1964 and ended with the Communist Party chief's 1982death.   Churbanov married Galina Brezhnev in 1971. He had worked as amechanic before taking a low-level Interior Ministry job in 1961.   Official media have reported extensively on the trial, which isexpected to last about two months. Some foreign reporters also arebeing allowed to attend.   During Monday's reading of the charges, it was repeatedlyalleged that Churbanov received the bribes from provincialofficials due to his connection with Brezhnev.   It said the co-defendants were among those who bribed Churbanov.   Churbanov also requested and received government constructionmaterials for a summer house, the indictment said.   He was quoted as saying gift-giving was merely a sign offriendship in Uzbekistan, a republic in Soviet Central Asia.   His co-defendants, accused taking bribes as well as giving them,are former Interior Minister Khaidar Yakhyaev, 61, of Uzbekistan;his former deputies Pyotr Begelman and Kakhramanov, and formerregional police chiefs identified as Norbutaev, S. Sabirov,Dzhamalov, M. Norov and Y. Makhamadzhanov.   According to Pravda, beginning in the 1970s cotton harvests inUzbekistan were padded by almost 1 million tons annually, with thegovernment made to pay for the non-existent crop by corruptofficials.   ``Today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole morethan 4 billion rubles ($6.34 billion) from the state, half of whichthey stuffed into their own pockets,'' the official Communist Partydaily reported earlier this year.</TEXT></DOC>
