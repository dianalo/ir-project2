GalanteStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 03/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> EUROP E FREST CNGNATURAL GAS, PIPELINES (LNG) </IN><TEXT>   WHEN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT decided to decontrol the natural-gas industry a few years ago, it sounded like a manufacturer's dream. A user would no longer be forced to buy its gas from the same pipeline that transmits it. Instead, a customer could shop around to buy the lowest-price gas directly from producers in the Southwest and then hire a pipeline just to transport it.    But decontrol has failed to live up to expectations, especially for small manufacturers. &quot;There always seems to be some knot in the hose,&quot; says Relle Moore, plant manager at E.J. Snyder Inc., a textile-finishing company in Albemarle, N.C. Mr. Moore figures Snyder would save $100,000 annually if it could buy &quot;transportation&quot; gas, as the industry calls gas purchased directly from a producer. But Snyder has been unable to persuade Transco Energy Co., the only interstate pipeline operator serving North Carolina, to provide it with transportation service.    Moreover, some manufacturers that have obtained transportation gas have run into unexpected risks. Kopp Glass Inc. in Swissvale, Pa., began getting such shipments last year. But one pipeline, Consolidated Gas Transmission Corp., reduced the delivery of gas destined for Kopp in each of the past two months.    CONSOLIDATED MADE UP the shortfall with supplies from another source. But if it hadn't, Kopp would have had to buy gas from a local utility. Had the weather turned cold enough to create what the utility considers a peak-demand period, Kopp would have had to pay a penalty of up to 30 times what it pays for transmission gas. &quot;We were sitting on the edge of our seats,&quot; says James G. Kroner, Kopp's plant manager.    A Consolidated spokesman says the company curtailed Kopp's supplies because of problems at a point where Consolidated's line connects with another pipeline. But Mr. Kroner suspects Consolidated is creating obstacles to discourage customers from buying gas from independent sources.    A spokeswoman for Transco acknowledges that some pipelines are, indeed, reluctant to become &quot;open-access&quot; carriers. She notes that the federal government is pushing pipelines to give customers like Kopp access to low-priced gas, while making it difficult for the pipelines themselves to get out of high-priced purchase agreements they signed during the energy crisis. &quot;It just doesn't make business sense&quot; to become an open-access carrier, she says.    ---   Europe Beckoning to Small Businesses    Small-business owners have been wooed for years by state development agencies. Now a new group is joining the courting: European development authorities. Most big U.S. companies have already established the overseas operations they need, European officials note. As a result, &quot;we're spending much more time with small companies,&quot; says Pascal Bonne, deputy director of the French Industrial Development Agency in New York.    Small companies are attractive candidates because they have &quot;lots of prospects for growth,&quot; says Donald Harrison, North American director for the Scottish Development Agency. &quot;If a company reaches around $20 million in sales and a portion of that is in Europe, they'll have to start thinking about a factory in Europe.&quot;    Some small companies are going to Europe to be close to big American customers. For instance, JMK Inc., an Amherst, N.H., maker of electronic components, recently set up a plant in Scotland to supply the European factories of Wang Laboratories Inc. and Digital Equipment Corp.    Others are availing themselves of European technology and cost savings. Survival Technology Inc., a maker of medical products in Bethesda, Md., is forming a biotechnology joint venture in Northern Ireland after discovering a wealth of genetic engineering expertise at Belfast universities.    Moreover, says Douglas Greenwold, a company vice president, in Northern Ireland &quot;a Ph.D. in electrical engineering earns only about $17,000. You can reduce ideas to products for a fraction of the cost and time that you could do it in the U.S.&quot; He notes that European government incentive grants reduce costs even more.    Finding qualified managers is the biggest concern of small U.S. companies, which usually can't spare managers from the home office. &quot;Most of them will look for local management,&quot; says Pierre F. Dobbelmann, executive director of the Netherlands Foreign Investment Agency. &quot;We can help with that.&quot;    ---   VENTURE-CAPITAL CLUBS have caught on in the U.S. as a way to match entrepreneurs and investors. Now the idea is being exported. Venture clubs have been established in Canada, West Germany, Sweden and South Africa, and one is to be formed this month in the Philippines. &quot;Most of the networking that is happening now -- between people with ideas and those that have funds -- is informal,&quot; says Antonio Basilio, an official at the Philippine Embassy in Washington. &quot;We hope the club will change that.&quot;    ---   VANITY VOCALS: Center Stage Inc. of Houston has a tuneful idea. It opens recording booths at retail centers that allow shoppers to make cassettes of themselves singing popular songs to a background of pre-recorded music. The top choices: &quot;The Greatest Love of All,&quot; &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; and &quot;Walk Like an Egyptian.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
