Guarino, resigned amidnews reports of defense-procurement fraud allegedly involvinghim, a now deceased Long Island businessman, and formerGrumman Chairman John O'Brien, who resigned in July.   Mr. Guarino's resignation came one day after a Newsdaycover story titled &quot;The Favored&quot; detailed Messrs. Gaurino'sand O'Brien's alleged involvement with the late James T.Kane, a Long Island businessman who helped run anow-disgraced political lobbying group representing areadefense firms. Among other things, the article alleged thatMr. Kane &quot;showered gifts and favors worth hundreds ofthousands of dollars&quot; on Messrs. Guarino and O'Brien while hedid business with Grumman.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Although I am innocent of any wrongdoing, suggestionscreated by Newsday articles may undermine the confidencepeople must feel in me as president of the systems group,&quot;Mr. Guarino, 52 years old, said in a company-issuedstatement. &quot;I reached this painful decision out of therespect that I feel for the people of Grumman and others, ingovernment and industry, with whom I have worked. I havealways sought the constructive solution; in this case, Ibelieve that requires my resignation.&quot;   An attorney said to be representing Mr. O'Brien declinedto comment.   Grumman systems group, established in April, 1989,comprises the electronics systems division in Great River,N.Y, Melbourne systems in Melbourne, Fla., and space systemsin Bethpage. Presidents of those divisions will now report toGrumman Chairman and Chief Executive Renso L.Caporali, whosucceeded Mr. O'Brien in July.   Mr. Guarino's stated reason for resigning was in contrastto that of Mr. O'Brien's, who said only that he was leavingfor personal reasons. As previously reported, before hisresignation, Mr. O'Brien became embroiled in the federalcriminal investigation of Pentagon procurement fraud andcorruption involving Long Island companies, as investigatorsstepped up their interest in his ties to Mr. Kane, who diedin February. Federal investigators are trying to determinewhether Grumman officials or their families received loans orother benefits from Mr. Kane or his firms, according to lawenforcement officials.   In May, a former shipping manager at Grumman's aerospaceunit pleaded guilty to charges of conspiring to defraud thegovernment by submitting to the Pentagon $300,000 of bogusbills submitted by a subcontractor controlled by Mr. Kane.The former Grumman manager is cooperating with prosecutors.</TEXT></DOC>
