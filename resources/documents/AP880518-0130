Alejandro Trouchine said the blast damaged his vehicle and thedoor of the house and broke windows, but no one was injured.Windows also shattered in neighboring homes, he said.   Trouchine, who opened the Tass office here in January, has hisoffice at his home.   Trouchine said he and his wife Elena were at home when theblast, heard in a large part of the southern part of the city,occurred at 2:20 a.m.   Their 12-year-old son Eugenio left two weeks ago for Moscow, hesaid.   He said that on May 9 he had received in the mail a communiquefrom ``Mano Blanca,'' Spanish for White Hand, which said in part:   ``The Mano Blanca rises again in the combative life ofGuatemala, raises its flags of western Christian civilizationagainst the new Marxist avalanche that keeps company with twoCommunist espionage agencies, Tass and Prensa Latina, for whom wehave a surprise at the right oportunity,'' the communique said.   Prensa Latina is the Cuban government news agency.   The communique, dated April 14, also threatened representativesof an exile opposition organization who visited the country a fewdays later. Parts of it were published in local newspapers at thetime.   In a dispatch from Moscow, Tass said the explosion gutted theTass office but said it happened Tuesday night. Violent attacks onSoviets and their facilities were seldom reported by the state-runmedia in the past, but the current ``glasnost'' campaign, whichencourages openness, has resulted in quicker acknowledgement ofsome such incidents.   The attack came a week after a failed coup attempt that thegovernment of President Vinicio Cerezo blamed on civilians, formermilitary officials and dissident officers.   Cerezo took office Jan. 14, 1986, as the first civilianpresident since 1970. He was the second civilian to take office inmore than 30 years of military and military-dominated rule.   Mano Blanca was most active from the mid-1960s until about 1980,claiming responsibility for bombing and assassinations of people itclaimed were communists.</TEXT></DOC>
