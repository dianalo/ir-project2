Add the time spent by assorted campaign aides, reporters and hangers-on, and it is clear that the equivalent of several lifetimes will have been spent by next February in two states with only 12 electoral votes and just 2% of the nation's population.    And it's only a harbinger of the rigors to come. &quot;The process demands the stamina of a mountain goat,&quot; says GOP strategist Eddie Mahe, a campaign veteran. Democratic Rep. Patricia Schroeder of Colorado, before she decided against seeking the presidential nomination, complained that she had been living on airplane food and hadn't the faintest idea what she had eaten for weeks.    &quot;I got to the point where I'd take half of it home at night to see if the dog would eat it,&quot; she said.    Because these early races will be the first real political fodder that pundits and strategists have chewed on in nearly four years, the Savery Hotel in Des Moines, Iowa, and the Center of New Hampshire Holiday Inn in Manchester, N.H., are loaded with out-of-town politicos, swapping lies and complaining about the weather.    Other tribal rites have begun. At the farms closest to the Des Moines airport, presidential candidates in full agricultural combat gear try, with mixed success, to get their pictures taken with the local pigs. &quot;There have been so many candidates I can't even list them,&quot; says farmer Woody Diehl. Carolyn McKee bars the press from her house, but she doesn't object if visitors such as Vice President and Mrs. Bush want to pose with her animals. &quot;Mrs. Bush petted the calves, but that wasn't his thing,&quot; she says. &quot;He stood there and wasn't too interested.&quot;    At nightfall, the candidates, strategists, reporters and others find one another at established watering holes to gossip about their day trips into the political wilderness. &quot;There are certain places you can walk into, and if you're a political columnist, you're going to fall over a story whether you like it or not,&quot; says Baltimore Evening Sun columnist Jack Germond.    In Des Moines, for example, there's Babe's, a restaurant run by a former wrestler, where politics is clearly the main fare. &quot;The drinks are fine, but you'd better not eat anything that's cooked,&quot; says ABC television correspondent Sander Vanocur. In Manchester, N.H., the Carpenter Hotel where John F. Kennedy started his presidential campaign has become an old folks' home, so a lot of the crowd has switched to the new Center of New Hampshire Holiday Inn or to the Highway Hotel in Concord, a favored GOP hang-out.    Then there is the Wayfarer, just outside Manchester, which is probably the most famous political hotel. This season, it is booked almost entirely by CBS, a fact that is alienating much of its old clientele. In years past, political junkies have lived and even died at the Wayfarer. Former New York Timesman Bill Lawrence, who became a reporter for ABC, didn't show up for dinner one night because he had died of a heart attack in his room. Another political pundit fell off his barstool there in 1972 and ended up in the hospital.    The political rituals include calling David Yepsen, the 36-year-old political reporter for the Des Moines Register. While campaign strategists try to gain his confidence, out-of-state reporters rely on his insights. Also quoted, if not widely respected, is the Manchester (N.H.) Union Leader, which is so full of screeds that Washington Post columnist Mary McGrory says reading it is like taking whiskey before breakfast.    There may be a metaphor in the fact that these early political tests take place in cold climates. After Iowa and New Hampshire, politicians and camp followers will find themselves in such locations as Maine and South Dakota in late Feburary. The focus will shift to sunnier weather, however, in preparation for Super Tuesday, March 8, when 20 primaries and caucuses will be held across much of the South, including Florida and Texas.    If New Hampshire is the veterans' favorite primary -- because you can get almost anywhere in the state and back in one day -- Florida and Texas are despised as logistical nightmares of 18-hour days and endless airports. &quot;You might as well call it Tarmac Tuesday,&quot; says Democratic pollster Harrison Hickman.    After Super Tuesday, reporters will be gathering at the Drake Hotel in Chicago, anticipating the big Illinois and Ohio primaries March 15. By then, half of all primary and caucus votes will have been cast, and strong front-runners may well have emerged. But if the races are still undecided, a handful of late-primary states will become critical: New York April 5, Pennsylvania April 26, California and New Jersey June 7.    But the biggest confabulations of political hangers-on, organ-grinders and mumbo-jumbo artists will be the two party conventions, the success of which depends largely on their location. Those political veterans unfortunate enough to have covered past conventions in Atlantic City &quot;Appalachia on the Sea&quot; -- or Miami or Dallas recall most of all the heat and the logistical agonies.    Dallas &quot;is the worst place I've ever been as a civilian,&quot; says Bob Shogun, political writer for the Los Angeles Times. At the 1984 GOP convention there, the temperature averaged 75 degrees -- around 100 outside in the fierce August sun and about 50 in the excessively air-conditioned convention hall. On the other hand, the weather in San Francisco for the Democrats was terrific -- but holding a convention there isn't necessarily a plus, as the Democrats learned.    Expectations are riding high for the GOP convention this year because it's in New Orleans, a city where the food is infallible and the atmosphere colorful enough for the most jaded campaign veteran. Politicos and reporters will hang out at Mosca's, Antoine's, Le Ruth's and for breakfast, at Brennan's. In Atlanta, Democrats with big expense accounts will stay at the Ritz Carlton; political junkies will gather at Gene and Gabe's restaurant and at Manuel's Tavern on Highland Avenue.    Once the nominees are chosen, the process will start all over again -- as reporters, pollsters and strategists fan out to the big states for the general election. They'll spend an inordinate amount of time in Philadelphia at the Latham Hotel and the Garden Restaurant; the city's a quick train ride from Washington. Ohio, a swing state since time immemorial, will also command an inordinate share of attention, though perhaps less than it deserves: It has fewer favored hang-outs.    Mostly, though, these travelers will see airports. For if the early primaries focus on retail politics -- shaking hands with a candidate and looking him in the eye -- the general election hinges on the wholesale politics of getting onto the nightly news. Campaign days are structured around how many media markets a modern jet plane can visit in 24 hours. For those on the plane, Portland, Ore., begins to look an awful lot like Portland, Maine. Some of them may end up visiting both on the same day.    But wherever they go, the veterans will try to follow columnist Germond's &quot;no ballroom rule&quot; -- finding hotels with no ballrooms, because that means you can use the elevators, hot water and phones, since there won't be some rowdy convention going on.    ---   Ms. Hume covers the White House from The Wall Street Journal's Washington bureau.    ---         Key Events of the 1988 Presidential Election    December  18               Filing deadline, New Hampshire                               primary    January    8               Des Moines Register's Iowa                               caucus debate (GOP)              15               Des Moines Register's Iowa                               caucus debate (Democrats)              16               State Republican party debate                               at Dartmouth College,                               Hanover, N.H.              24               State Democratic party debate                               at University of New                               Hampshire, Durham, N.H.              29, 30           Michigan state convention                               (GOP)    February   8               Iowa caucus              13               League of Women Voters                               debate, Manchester, N.H.
