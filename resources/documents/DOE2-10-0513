Based on numerical data and facts explaining thesecalibration errors diagrams and test point tables give access to therequirements of temperatur sensor pairs. Reference is made to the measurementconditions the testing of calibration error limit observation is basedon. After informing about the distribution of measuring incertaintiesin the case of test both temperature measurements as well as about testbath temperatures and test methods the paper deals with the problemsof temperature sensor pair selection and pair selection methods. Theauthor differentiates between small and large sensor quantities (errorcalculation) and points out possible ways of optimizing the differentpair selection methods. The conclusion is dedicated to numerical dataand equations exemplifying possible temperature sensor pairs (deviationfor forward/back flow temperature differences, admissible deviations).(HWJ).</TEXT></DOC>
