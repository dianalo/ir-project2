L.P. said its unit holders approved the sale of some non-producing oil and gas interests to Apache Corp., its general partner.    Apache Corp.'s chairman and chief executive officer, Raymond Plank, said the sale will enable Apache Petroleum to reduce debt and improve its balance sheet. The Denver-based company also said the sale would enable the limited partnership to maintain cash distributions to holders at least through 1988.    In the initial stages of the transaction, the limited partnership will receive about $20 million in cash and $8 million of Apache Corp. common for certain leasehold acreage and related assets. In addition, Apache is obligated to acquire additional properties over the next five years at market value.    Apache Petroleum is an oil and gas limited partnership. Apache Corp. is an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. </TEXT></DOC>
