 Do you really need multitasking and, if so, is it enough to haveseveral programs running on a single computer, or should several users haveaccess to those programs?andM;OS/2 provides expensive but useful facilities for single users, but to havegood multiuser capabilities do you need to move to UNIX with all the expensethat entails?andM;If you stick with single-user operation, does your budget have room for thepurchase of up to six or more megabytes of memory for every user?andP;  You needthat much with OS/2 or you miss the advantages it brings to micros.andM;Although OS/2 is a solid operating system, there are other less-expensiveways to move into single-user multitasking.andM;DESQview from QuarterDeck Office Systems Inc., Santa Monica, Calif., will runMS-DOS application software with no modifications and will run several of thesoftware packages simultaneously in only a 640K 8088 system.andP;  It needs justthe 640K for small programs, and the user can swap disks or use enhancedexpanded memory for larger programs.andM;With 2M RAM in my IBM PS/2 Model 80 I can run several of DESQview's DOSutilities, two copies of WordPerfect 4.1, SideKick Plus and a copy of Reflexsimultaneously, even without swapping any programs to disk.andM;A Powerful ToolandM;DESQview's cut-and-paste feature lets me copy text or data between any twonon-graphics screens.andP;  Since my foreground work is mostly keyboarding, Iseldom pay any performance penalty.andM;Running HyperAccess from Hilgraeve Inc., Monroe, Mich., lets me runcommunications sessions in the background, and I even can format diskettes orcopy files while word processing.andM;If all you need is the ability to load or run several DOS applicationssimultaneously on your PCs, then DESQview is a powerful and inexpensive tool.andM;Microsoft Windows run regular DOS programs as well as those specificallydesigned for it, but it is notoriously slow and memory-hungry.andP;  It also lacksmacros and easy access to programs, requiring a mouse to be really friendly.andM;DESQview and Windows are shells that reside over the regular MS-DOS operatingsystem, but Digital Research's Concurrent DOS is a replacement operatingsystem.andP;  It runs multiple DOS-compatible programs and lets you create asimple multiuser system.andP;  Digital Research Inc. of Monterey, Calif., is, ofcourse, the company that created the CP/M operating system that predates DOS,and its Concurrent software is a solid, reliable product.andM;How does OS/2 stack up against DESQview?andM;OS/2 is a massive single-user operating system, but it requires totally newsoftware for any multitasking and gobs of RAM.andP;  It also opens access to muchmore memory but, again, only for special software.andM;The Extended Edition includes a Structured Query Language database enginethat is every bit as powerful as MS-DOS programs costing as much as theentire OS/2 Extended Edition package.andM;Extended Edition also comes with 9370 terminal communications capabilitiesthat let users tie into mainframes.andM;To run OS/2 you need an 80286 or 80386, but unlike the DESQview 386, Windows386 and Concurrent DOS 386 operating environments, OS/2 doesn't let youaccess any special 386 features.andP;  It is strictly a 286 operating system thatalso runs on the 386.andM;Unlike OS/2, all of these other programs generally let you multitask standardMS-DOS applications software, eliminating the wait for and expense of newprograms.andP;  Also unlike OS/2, the others come in different versions that letthem run on different levels of computer.andM;How about performance?andM;DESQview slows down some operations even when the background windows areinactive.andP;  For example, on my 16-MHz Model 80 PS/2 it takes 0.35 second toload a 40K file into WordPerfect under MS-DOS, and 0.76 second when operatingin a DESQview window.andM;Scrolling times are similar under MS-DOS or DESQview with background programsinactive, but WordPerfect operation times with BASIC loops running in fourbackground windows are slower in direct relation to the proportion of timeallocated to the background operations.andM;Slower to RunandM;Generally DESQview doesn't extract much performance penalty for providingmultitasking except when background programs are actually running, not justloaded.andP;  Then the penalty isn't really due to extraneous overhead; it is justthat the processor is doing a lot more.andM;It's impossible to say if OS/2 programs are running slower under OS/2 -- theydon't run anywhere else -- but WordPerfect runs in the compatibility windowwith no noticeable difference.andM;OS/2 allocates CPU time to various programs and is about as fast as DESQviewwhen properly set up.andP;  No precise comparison is possible because theapplications software is different.andM;Where OS/2 really shines is with new programs such as Paradox OS/2, whichlets you do sorting, indexing and editing simultaneously on the same file.andP;  Iwas not able to measure any difference in speed between running a Paradoxoperation alone and with a Paradox database sort running simultaneously inthe background.andM;DESQview running two or more Paradox operations simultaneously would havebeen much slower, no matter how you set the background and foreground timing.andM;Two long tasks running in Paradox under DESQview would take a bit more timethan if run sequentially under MS-DOS.andP;  Both would take very little more timethan the longer of the two running under OS/2.andM;One last point to remember: OS/2 is still the premier operating system if youneed SQL or mainframe communications, and it is true Big Blue.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
