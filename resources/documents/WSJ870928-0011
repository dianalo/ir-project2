Tariffs on the products, including machine tools, computers, televisions and cosmetics, will be lowered to between 15% and 25%, effective Jan. 1.    Ministry officials said the cuts marked the fourth round of tariff reductions this year. They said the three previous actions involved a total of 157 items. The U.S. has presented the Seoul government with a list of 738 items on which it wants tariffs reduced.    Washington has pressured Korea to lower its tariff and nontariff barriers in an effort to reduce its trade surplus with the U.S., which stood at $7.3 billion last year. The U.S. also wants Korea to allow its currency, the won, to rise. The won has increased 6.9% against the dollar this year, but Korean officials said they want it to remain stable for the rest of 1987.    Separately, the ministry said Korea will reduce tariffs on 39 other items by between three and 15 points. These cuts, however, are aimed at curbing inflation; the government said it was concerned that prices for the goods would rise because the products are in short supply. The affected items include soybeans, cottonseed oil, industrial diamonds and cold-rolled steel plate. </TEXT></DOC>
