These gasesand others can be separated out from stream gases using permeable membranesin a reverse osmosis process. The membranes are really strands of hollow,plastic-like threads, extruded from cellulose acetates. Use of membranesto separate gas has one prime advantage over present day technology;it requires no moving parts, and membranes have a very long lifespan.When Alberta was pursuing diversification within the natural gas industryin the late 1960s, the Alberta Research Council with TransCanada PipeLinesand Alberta Natural Gas Co. initiated a pilot plant to use membrane technologyfrom Japan to extract helium from natural gas streams destined for export.With greater emphasis now being placed on enhanced oil recovery projectsusing carbon oxides, gas separation using membranes may well have foundits market niche. The principal of gas separation by membranes workson the dynamics of partial pressures where gases will separate out naturallyaccording to their molecular weight and its accompanying PVT (pressure,volume, temperature) characteristics. With cellular membranes, the mostdependent and changable variable is pressure. Pressure is normally suppliedby a compressor, or off an appropriate steam of pressure within the existingprocess. The membranes are packaged in bundles, which vary in lengthand diameter according to the volumes of gases to be separated. Currentlythe best market for membrane separation of gases in the oil industry,is for producing CO/sub 2/, where most of the major companies have existingmiscible floods, or have them on the drawing boards.</TEXT></DOC>
