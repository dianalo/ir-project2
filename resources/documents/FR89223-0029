Authorization to share the frequencies will permit the transmissionof diagnostic telemetry data during the flights of fully operational commerciallaunch vehicles. Such data will be used to determine whether the componentsof fully operational launch vehicles must be modified to improve theirperformance or prevent a catastrophic failure during flight.<ITAG tagnum="84">Ordering Clauses</ITAG>This is a non-restricted notice and comment rule making proceeding. <T3>See </T3>andSection; 1.1231 of the Commission's Rules, 47 CFR 1.1231,for rules governing permissible <T3>ex parte</T3> contacts.The Commission hereby certifies pursuant to section 605(b) of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96-354), that these rules, if promulgated,will not have a signficant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. Although these proposed changes allow the aerospace communitygreater flexibility in the operation of launch vehicles and result in someexpenditures for equipment, these additional, optional expenditures shouldbe minimal.The proposal contained herein has been analyzed with respect to the PaperworkReduction Act of 1980 and found to contain no new or modified form, informationcollection and/or record keeping, labeling, disclosure, or record retentionrequirements; and will not increase or decrease burden hours imposed onthe public.Authority for issuance of this <T3>Notice </T3>is contained in section 4(i) and 303(r) of the CommunicationsAct of 1934, as amended, 47 U.S.C. 154(i) and 303(r). Pursuant to applicableprocedures set forth in andSection;andSection; 1.415 and 1.419 of the Commission'sRules, 47 CFR 1.415 and 1.419, interested parties may file comments andreply comments as indicated in the <T2>``DATES''</T2> paragraph of this document. All relevant and timelycomments will be considered by the Commission before final action is takenin this proceeding.A copy of the Notice of Proposed Rule Making will be served on the ChiefCounsel for Advocacy of the Small Business Administration.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects </ITAG>47 CFR Part 2Frequency Allocations, Treaties.47 CFR Part 87Aviation Services, Aeronautical stations.<ITAG tagnum="20">Federal Communications Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Donna R.
