OttenStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/27/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LABORLABOR DEPARTMENT (LBR) </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>    It's a variant on therising-tide-lifts-all-boats theme: Worker shortages helpeveryone in the job market.   So the coming years -- when the labor force will grow more slowly as the relatively fewer offspring of the &quot;baby bust&quot; generation succeed the more numerous baby boom generation -- should provide underclass blacks and Hispanics with an unparalleled chance to get jobs and rise out of poverty. And there are experts who see just such a &quot;window of opportunity.&quot;    Unfortunately, however, a classic mismatch of opportunity and people is the more likely outcome. Most new jobs in the large urban areas, where so many of these &quot;at risk&quot; people live, will demand far higher literacy, work skills and work habits than many possess. And most new entry-level jobs they might be able to fill will be in distant suburbs, exurbs and small towns.    &quot;The demographics create an opportunity but don't guarantee it,&quot; says William Johnston, a Hudson Institute researcher studying the situation for the Labor Department. &quot;The shift to higher-skill jobs creates a huge counter-trend. For black men and Hispanics, the evolving job market is a real problem.&quot;    Says Assistant Labor Secretary Roger Semerad: &quot;The demographics suggest we are not going to have sufficient workers in the coming years. We're going to need these school dropouts, the functional illiterates, the welfare dependent, the pregnant teen-agers, the drug abusers -- but they have to be qualified to take the jobs coming down the road.&quot; Mr. Semerad heads the Labor Department's &quot;Workforce 2000&quot; project, which pushes a variety of literacy and job-training programs, both government and private.    The numbers creating the opportunity are clear. Because of falling birth rates from 1965 through the mid-1970s, the pool of new workers is growing more slowly than at any time since the 1930s. &quot;Between now and the year 2000,&quot; a Labor Department analysis declares, &quot;labor markets may be tighter than at any time in recent history.&quot;    That should mean a break for young people entering the labor force, and particularly minorities. Since the white birth rate dropped far more precipitously during the baby bust than did black or Hispanic rates, young whites will be a smaller than ever percentage of new entrants. The Hudson Institute estimates that blacks, Hispanics and other minorities will supply 29% of the net work force addition between 1985 and 2000, as against 18.4% between 1970 and 1985.    Southern metropolitan areas &quot;are entering a period of very slow growth in the white labor force,&quot; Louisiana State University sociologist Kenneth Hinze notes. &quot;Communities like ours will need black people in a way we have never needed black people before.&quot;    But even the optimists concede that unless minority men and women greatly increase their language, math and reading skills, they'll still be out in the cold.    Between 1985 and 2000, says a Hudson Institute study, jobs will decline in manufacturing, mining and other industries where unskilled men have traditionally found entry-level employment as laborers, helpers, hand workers and the like. The big job growth, the study finds, will be in information processing, services and other fields where most work will require not only ability to read and write but considerably more. It forecasts that by 2000, people with less than a high school education will be able to fill only 14% of all jobs, compared with 18% today.    True, the Labor Department's Mr. Semerad adds, much is being done to &quot;de-skill&quot; jobs -- using pictures instead of words to tell how to perform certain tasks, for example -- but &quot;de-skilling can only be carried so far.&quot;    Entry-level jobs in fast-food and a number of other service enterprises will, of course, increase substantially, but many will be in suburban shopping malls and rural districts too remote or expensive for many inner-city workers to reach. &quot;There is a huge deficit in entry-level jobs in the cities where the labor pool is, and a huge deficit of entry-level workers in the areas where the jobs are,&quot; says John Kasarda, head of the University of North Carolina's sociology department. &quot;So the rising tide doesn't lift all the boats. Jobs in outlying areas don't do the inner-city high school dropout much good.&quot;    But won't the need for workers oblige employers to hire these people, even though they lack skills and work habits? No way, say the manpower experts. The employers will use retirees part time -- as fast-food chains are already doing -- or create more job-sharing arrangements for women who don't want to work full time. Employers will automate and substitute machines for manpower; until now, the abundance of relatively cheap labor has served to delay automation of many low-skill service jobs. And the pull of opportunity and the urge to escape war and dictators will continue to attract large numbers of immigrants -- legal or illegal -- into the U.S. labor force.    Many liberals believe that to bring about a better fit between new jobs and young &quot;at risk&quot; blacks and Hispanics, there must be far greater dollar investment in these areas than the Reagan administration proposes. And some also see a need for housing subsidies, enforcement of fair-housing laws and other measures to enable minority families to move to outlying areas where entry-level jobs are multiplying.    Most conservatives counter, however, that much of the problem arises from a too-generous welfare system and an easy-on-crime approach that encourage minority youths to spurn low-wage jobs. These conservatives contend that if education and training programs are ever to have much effect, there must also be work requirements for welfare, tougher law-enforcement and other changes that might breed a sense of values and family and personal responsibility.    Furthermore, the gloomy predictions for the less-skilled blacks and Hispanics are being made under expectations of fairly steady overall U.S. economic growth. &quot;If there isn't good economic growth, these minority groups will suffer even more,&quot; warns the Hudson Institute's Mr. Johnston.    ---          Job Growth Rate            1984-1985 High Skill Jobs ............... 23% All Jobs ...................... 15% Low Skill Jobs ................ 12% Source: Labor Department</TEXT></DOC>
