I saw it with my own eyes,'' ArchbishopTorkom Manoogian of the Diocese of the Armenian Church of Americasaid during a divine liturgy at St. Vartan Cathedral in Manhattan.   The church observes Christmas on Jan. 6.   ``Even though we are mourning, we can still say `MerryChristmas,''' he said in Armenian. ``We ask God for the grace to beable to celebrate Christmas through these hard times.''   The pain of the earthquake that devastated Soviet Armenia on Dec.7 was felt by those who had gathered. Hundreds of thousands wereleft homeless and 25,000 people were killed.   Relief poured in from around the world, including $3 million adiocesan spokeswoman said was collected locally. A hangar at KennedyInternational Airport was donated for collecting and transportingrelief supplies, she said.   The archbishop designated a 40-day period of mourning that endsJan. 15; the money for Christmas gifts went to relief efforts;festivities, including New Year's celebrations, were put off.   The church's usual children's Christmas party on Saturday will bereplaced by a requiem for the children who died, followed by amadagh, or memorial meal.   ``We can't believe the earthquake happened. We may ask where isGod because such a tragedy happened,'' Manogian continued inArmenian, as translated by the church spokeswoman, Aileen Krikoryan.   ``God is there in the face of the earthquake.''   And, the archbishop continued in English, ``people tell us weshould not (celebrate) because something terrible has happened toour people in Armenia.''   ``Who can refuse it? Who can say, `Not today, we don't want it.'Even in our sorrow, we need that grace to carry our heavy sorrowwhich is almost unbearable,'' he said, as incense swirled above.   The archbishop later said he hoped Armenians did not ``fall intoa state of hopelessness.''   ``We celebrate our Christmas with doleful, sorrowful eyes,''Manoogian said in an impromtu homily in the church's hall.``However, those looks are not looks of despair. They are looks ofcompassion, and steadfast faith.''   Among the 100 people or so scattered about the cavernouscathedral were those who had lost relatives. But Armenians quicklytell visitors that all Armenians are related.   ``I'm not particularly religious, but I feel compelled to come inlight of the tragedy. The Armenian church helps us grievetogether,'' said Mendor Ozcelik, a 21-year-old New York resident whoattends the University of Connecticut at Storrs.   ``The church is more than religion to Armenians _ it's unifyingus in a nationalistic way,'' he said, adding that he attendedservices on the first Sunday after the earthquake for the first timein years.</TEXT></DOC>
