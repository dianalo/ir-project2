(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Bush, marking Earth Day on abeach at sunrise, assured environmentalists Sunday they won't be``too disappointed'' with his upcoming decision on offshore oildrilling.   Bush, vacationing at a favorite fishing haunt, also unveiled apresent for the Florida Keys: a proposal to bar big ships andvessels carrying oil or hazardous materials from the sea lanesaround its fragile coral reef.   He announced the United States is petitioning the InternationalMaritime Organization in London to designate the waters within 10miles of these islads stretching along the Florida coast as an``area to be avoided'' by the big ships.   Bush, an avid outdoorsman and angler, went fishing for a secondday, with Curt Gowdy along to film a presidential episode of ``TheAmerican Sportsman.''   Before flying home to the White House, Bush also made atelephone call to Nepal to cheer on an international team scalingMount Everest on a clean-up mission. He also addressed by telephonethousands of people at an Earth Day rally in the Columbia RiverGorge in Washington state.   The climbers included representatives of the United States,China and Soviet Union. ``Reaching the top of Mount Everest in thename of peace and understanding reminds all of us on this specialday that there is no task that's too great for the human spirit,''the president told them.   He told an Earth Day rally in the Columbia River Gorge thatenvironmental efforts must be balanced with sound businesspractices.   While saying that much remains to be done to protect the Earth,Bush said ``We've got to integrate the goal of a strong economywith that of an improved environment. And we don't have to tradeoff a lot of jobs in order to protect and preserve.''   ``I really am confident that when we celebrate Earth Day's 30thanniversary, we will have a cleaner, a safer and a healthierworld,'' Bush said.   The flurry of activities was timed to coincide with the 20thanniversary of the original Earth Day, which first bredenvironmentalism into the national conscience.   The White House staged a photo opportunity at dawn for Bush andfounders of a Key West group, Reef Relief, which on Friday wasnamed one of Bush's daily ``points of light'' for its efforts toprotect the coral reefs.   Its volunteers install buoys that sightseeing and fishing boatscan tie up to instead of dropping anchor and damaging the reef.   Craig Quirolo, who founded the group with his wife DeeVon, urgedthe president in private not to lift a moratorium on drilling inthree environmentally sensitive tracts, two off the Californiacoast and one here off the Keys and Everglades.   The moratorium has prevented oil companies that paid $109million for 73 leases on these tracts in the early 1980s fromdrilling exploratory wells.   Bush has postponed for months his decision on whether to allowor ban drilling in pristine areas. While defending the safetyrecord of the oil industry on offshore drilling, he has hintedbefore that he may be unwilling to subject the Keys and theEverglades to the risks of a spill.   Bush, a former oilman, said Quirolo ``raised with me the verysensitive question of offshore drilling. ... I told him there wouldbe an answer very, very soon. And I didn't think he'd be toodisappointed.''   Florida Gov. Bob Martinez and the small crowd of spectatorsapplauded.   Outlining the plan to close the sea lanes around the Keys toships longer than 50 meters and oil or hazardous materialfreighters, Bush said:   ``The Exxon Valdez disaster has made us all painfully aware ofthe ecological devastation which can result from a major oilspill.''   He called Florida's multi-hued coral reefs ``one of the mostdiverse ecosystems in the world and a unique national treasure.''   Three ships have run aground and damaged reefs in the past sixmonths in the sea lanes Bush wants closed.</TEXT></DOC>
