Bloch immunity to get him to reveal what secrets hedivulged rather than try to arrest him, a former prosecutor says.   Former U.S. Attorney Joseph diGenova said Sunday, ``Even in thebest of circumstances, espionage cases are very difficult to makein the area of what has been referred to as the `wilderness ofmirrors.'''   ``You try to get them to disgorge enough information to confirmwhat you already have and then use that for leads,'' diGenova, whoprosecuted the Jonathan Pollard spy case several years ago, said onABC's ``This Week With David Brinkley.''   But most accounts indicate that Bloch, a 30-year StateDepartment veteran, has been reluctant to reveal why he reportedlywas seen passing a briefcase to a Soviet KGB agent a few months agoin Paris.   Bloch, 54, has not been charged with any crime but has beenunder 24-hour surveillance by the FBI.   Sources have said Bloch was recruited by the Soviets when heserved at the newly opened U.S. Embassy in East Berlin in 1974. Helater served at the U.S. Embassy in Austria, long a hotbed forEast-West espionage activities, from 1980 to 1987.   Bloch, whose State Department access has been suspended,reportedly admitted to having taken money from the KGB.   French newspapers this weekend reported that Bloch was filmed byFrench agents at the beginning of this year passing a briefcase toa KGB agent involved in circumventing a ban on the sale of hightechnology to the Soviets.   The weekly Journal du Dimanche reported Sunday that the man withBloch in the film was a member of the Soviet diplomatic mission toUNESCO. But, the newspaper said, the Soviet diplomat actually was aspy working for a new KGB service known as Agency 4, charged withstealing sensitive technology secrets.   DiGenova said the United States should offer Bloch immunity,bring him before a grand jury and threaten him with an 18-monthprison term for contempt of court if he fails to answer thequestions.   Several administration sources have suggested that anyadmissions made by Bloch to the FBI or State Departmentinvestigators fell well short of the legal requirements for arrest.The focus now, according to diGenova, must center on learning whathas been revealed to Soviet agents.   One of the pressing questions to which diGenova said a responseis needed is how word of the U.S. investigation of Bloch was leakedand whether there are Soviet ``moles'' inside the government.According to sources, the Soviets contacted the diplomat and toldhim he was under investigation.   ``That is a very dangerous and concerning revelation, that hewas warned by his KGB handler after the United States governmenthad begun its investigation,'' diGenova said.   Stanislav Levchenko, a former KGB officer, said: ``It is notimpossible at all that at some level there can be one, two, threeother assets of the Soviets who one way or another learned aboutthis investigation and tipped him off.''   Sen. David L. Boren, chairman of the Senate's intelligencecommittee, said lessons should be learned from the Bloch casebecause such incidents are inevitable.   ``Most people think that we have glasnost, we have arms controlnegotiations going on, the problem is over. We're having a muchbetter relationship with the Soviet Union,'' the Oklahoma Democratsaid on ABC. ``It's ironic, ... as Star Wars winds down, spy warsare heating up.   ``And it makes sense. As military budgets are being cut, forexample, in the Soviet Union, they are desperate to gettechnology.''</TEXT></DOC>
