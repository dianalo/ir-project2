LaRouche on charges of obstructing the government's three-year investigation into alleged credit-card fraud by some of his organizations and associates.    Yesterday's move was the first time Mr. LaRouche has been accused of criminal activity stemming from the Justice Department's probe, but a number of his political organizations and supporters previously were indicted on charges of collecting more than $1 million in unauthorized charges on the credit cards of contributors.    The grand jury in Boston accused Mr. LaRouche, the controversial leader of an ultraconservative political group and a three-time presidential candidate, of conspiring to &quot;stymie&quot; and &quot;block&quot; the investigation into his financial affairs and the affairs of his organizations.    The indictment charges that Mr. LaRouche reassigned certain fund-raisers in an effort to impede the grand jury's investigation, and that he knew about alleged efforts by some associates to burn potentially incriminating records dealing with the financing of his self-styled presidential campaign in 1984.    Mr. LaRouche flew to West Germany after his appearance before the grand jury on Monday, but his lawyer, Odin T. Anderson, said yesterday that his client intends to return voluntarily as part of an agreement with federal prosecutors. The Justice Department, however, in its news release, went out of its way to note that the U.S. extradition treaty with West Germany covers the charges filed against Mr. LaRouche.    Mr. Anderson said Mr. LaRouche &quot;will surrender himself and stand trial and obviously expects to be acquitted by an unbiased jury.&quot; Mr. LaRouche provided &quot;testimony which he believes to have been full, candid and exculpatory,&quot; Mr. Anderson asserted during a news conference in Boston.    The indictment was returned on Tuesday but kept under seal until yesterday. If convicted, Mr. La Rouche faces a maximum of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.    In addition to Mr. LaRouche, the indictment charges two related corporations, three organizations and a total of 13 associates with fraud, conspiracy and other criminal acts.    Most of the defendants were named in a previous indictment returned by the same grand jury last October, which charged that the credit-card scheme involved more than $1 million in unauthorized charges in 2,000 separate transactions.    Frank McNamara, the U.S. attorney in Boston, said the latest indictment concludes his office's investigation of Mr. LaRouche and his organizations. But a related grand jury investigation in Alexandria, Va., is continuing, according to Justice Department officials.    According to the indictment, the effort to obstruct the federal investigation included burning and shredding of documents subpoenaed by a grand jury, refusing to produce witnesses before a grand jury and making false statements to investigators. The indictment includes excerpts of memos between top LaRouche associates discussing ways to deny investigators &quot;access to documents and people.&quot;    The indictment also alleges that in November 1984, two of Mr. LaRouche's associates discussed contacting a &quot;former deputy director of the Central Intelligence Agency&quot; with a request to &quot;fix or quash&quot; the Boston grand jury investigation. The former CIA official wasn't identified in the court papers, and it isn't clear whether such contact was ever made.    In February 1985, according to the indictment, Mr. LaRouche and one of his associates discussed trying to impede the grand jury investigation by making a &quot;vicious personal attack&quot; on William Weld, who was then the U.S. attorney in Boston and is currently the assistant attorney general in charge of the criminal division.    In addition to the federal charges, Virginia and New York state authorities have filed charges against more than two dozen of Mr. LaRouche's associates in connection with an alleged scheme to fraudulently solicit millions of dollars in loans from people around the country. </TEXT></DOC>
