At a recent computer trade show in Dallas, one of Sun's biggest suppliers of chips, Motorola Inc., prevented Sun employees from attending a public press conference even though several of Sun's competitors were sharing the stage with Motorola.    It has been open season on Sun ever since company officials outlined a bold strategy last summer to spearhead a revolution in the computer industry. Sun's plan is to orchestrate for the entire industry the same kind of explosive growth that International Business Machines Corp. unwittingly unleashed for the personal-computer segment when it decided to use standard hardware designs and software for its ubiquitous and oft-copied PC.    What Sun is doing is inviting other manufacturers to build so-called clones that employ a hot new hardware design from Sun and an older, powerful operating-software system owned by Sun's chief ally, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Sun's hardware design is so versatile that it could be the basis of machines that run the gamut -- in size, price and performance -- from desktop models to mainframes.    Major government and corporate customers and even small businesses could pick and choose products from a multitude of manufacturers to build seamless, compatible computer systems to manage their information. They currently either rely on one manufacturer or, more commonly, piece together, from a number of manufacturers, systems that too often resemble a modern-day Tower of Babel.    &quot;We're talking about the PC-ization of the entire computer industry,&quot; says William Joy, a Sun co-founder and vice president for technology, who is one of the scheme's masterminds.    Sun's strategy taps powerful but simple ideas whose time may have come. Computer users are clamoring for more industrywide standards than currently exist for hardware and software. Meanwhile, many computer makers also are embracing standards as a means to reduce manufacturing and research costs while broadening markets for their products. But standards also portend a dangerous, cutthroat world for many companies that fear having to compete on some other basis than proprietary technology -- namely, by constantly innovating, shortening product cycles and improving price-performance, as personal-computer companies do.    &quot;Sun is taking the idea of standards to a wild and crazy extreme, and that upsets some of our competitors,&quot; says Mr. McNealy, who asserts that &quot;the customers are on our side on this one.&quot;    Sun came up with its new strategy not only because customers wanted it, of course, but also because it gives Sun the maximum chance to expand rapidly and become a leader in the computer industry. Until now, Sun has focused entirely on making its powerful computers for engineers -- and for scientists and other technical users.    To many of its competitors, Sun is a presumptuous youngster trying to impose a self-serving vision of the business on its elders. And some who like that vision suspect that Sun may end up being clobbered by its allies even if the industry embraces its standards, just as IBM was battered by PC clone makers. Some analysts feel that the cockiness -- some say arrogance -- of Sun's youthful, hard-driving top executives is more likely to alienate potential allies than win them over.    Even so, ATandamp;T, Xerox Corp. and Unisys Corp. have braved the criticism of their peers by announcing plans to follow Sun's blueprint. Based on that support and other endorsements expected soon, plus Sun's blazing growth to date building computers around existing industry standards, many think Sun's new, broader strategy will make it the next computer giant. The six-year-old company is already generating sales at an annual rate exceeding $1 billion.    &quot;Where there were once only three truly influential computer companies in the world -- IBM, Digital and Apple -- now there is a fourth emerging, and that is Sun,&quot; says Stewart Alsop, a computer-industry analyst who publishes PC Letter. &quot;I don't think Sun is tilting at windmills, either, because their ideas make so much sense.&quot;    The key to Sun's strategy is the marriage of its powerful and flexible new hardware design with ATandamp;T's Unix, an operating system that has been experiencing a revival. The hardware is based on a Sun-developed microprocessor chip called the Sparc, a high-powered device that employs so-called RISC -- or reduced instruction set computer -- techniques, which make it easier and cheaper to manufacture than a conventional microprocessor. A microprocessor is the brain of a computer, manipulating data and performing calculations at the behest of the operating system.    Sun has already started selling Sparc-based machines that reflect the price-performance advantages of its new design. Its most costly model, priced at $40,000, provides the horsepower of comparable conventional machines costing 10 times as much. And Sun officials claim that the $300 Sparc chip is cheap enough to be used as the heart of a new genre of extremely powerful personal computers, unofficially dubbed &quot;Sparcintoshes,&quot; that could be priced under $5,000.    The Sparc chip is unusual in another way: Sun, which doesn't make chips, turned to a Japanese concern -- Fujitsu Ltd. -- to be the first to make and market it. (Three smaller American companies, LSI Logic Inc. of Milpitas, Calif., Cypress Semiconductor Corp. of San Jose, Calif., and Bipolar Integrated Technologies of Beaverton, Ore., also have signed up to make and market the Sparc.) Sun called on Fujitsu in 1983 after being turned down by several big American chip makers, including Motorola and Intel Corp., which said they preferred making chips of their own design.    &quot;We were impressed with their self-confidence and the common sense of their design,&quot; says Kenichi Katashiba, vice president of Fujitsu Microelectronics Inc., based in Santa Clara, Calif. He recalls that parent-company officials made up their minds to back the Sparc the same day that Sun's Mr. Joy made an impromptu presentation at Fujitsu's headquarters in Japan. &quot;I only wish I had negotiated harder to get some stock warrants in return for making the Sparc,&quot; Mr. Katashiba says.    Some believe that as a result of Sun's alliance with Fujitsu, companies like Intel and Motorola will lose their historical hammerlock on markets for industry-standard microprocessors. &quot;The real significance of Sparc and of RISC technology is that you no longer have to be a huge semiconductor company, with $100 million to spare for research and development, to come up with a state-of-the-art microprocessor,&quot; says Steven Blank, vice president of marketing for Ardent Computer Corp., who notes that Sun's Sparc cost only $25 million to develop.    All the publicity surrounding the Sparc has jarred other U.S. chip makers, some of whom accuse Sun of overstating its potential performance. Motorola has stepped up the development and promotion of its own RISC-based chip in an attempt to short-circuit the Sparc as a standard-setter. Advanced Micro Devices Inc., another Silicon Valley chip maker, has announced its own RISC chip as well, and Intel, which previously dismissed RISC as a temporary phenomenon, will use similar techniques in some of its future microprocessors.    The other main ingredient in Sun's vision, the Unix operating system, has long been used in Sun's previous computers -- lower-performance machines that it still makes. Sun officials decided last summer that if they could persuade ATandamp;T to help them fine-tune a special version of Unix to run on the Sparc, the chip would stand a better chance of being adopted by other manufacturers. Meanwhile, ATandamp;T, which had lost billions of dollars trying to make it big in the computer business, was casting about for a new strategy for one last attempt. ATandamp;T also wanted to refine Unix, which had evolved into dozens of slightly different dialects, into a more universal operating system.    Sensing their complementary needs, the two companies started talking. &quot;When I first met Scott (McNealy), it was if we had both been briefed by the same adviser,&quot; recalls Vittorio Cassoni, president of ATandamp;T's data-systems division. &quot;We both had the same vision for the future of the industry.&quot;    Finally, on Oct. 19, in an announcement all but overlooked in the hubbub surrounding the stock-market crash that day, the two companies disclosed an alliance under which ATandamp;T agreed to adopt the Sparc design for a new family of business computers while Sun agreed to help ATandamp;T refine and improve Unix. ATandamp;T cemented the relationship in January, when it agreed to purchase a 20% stake in Sun.    That agreement riled Sun's competitors, who already felt that Sun's role in reworking Unix smacked of favoritism by ATandamp;T and unfair competitive advantages for Sun. &quot;Sun is already polarizing the industry&quot; with its Sparc design, says Mark Hatch, manager of software-product marketing for Apollo Computer. &quot;But by joining with ATandamp;T to unify Unix, they're trying to control the whole game.&quot;    Adds John Mashey, director of operating-system software for MIPS Computer Inc., which also designed a RISC microprocessor that uses Unix: &quot;Sun turned from being a friendly goldfish, offering graphics or communications standards for the industry to take or leave, into a shark trying to force its whole architecture down our throats.&quot;    Companies like Apollo, Digital and Hewlett-Packard have benefited greatly from their proprietary designs, and they fear that endorsing Sun's idea will make Sun the industry's leader by default. The last thing they want, however, is to be caught at a competitive disadvantage at a time when sales of Unix-based computers are taking off. Many industry analysts believe that Unix will be the fastest-growing operating system between now and the early 1990s.    Despite the apparent rosy future for Unix, Sun faces some pitfalls. For one thing, Sun is trying to impose its vision on a robust industry with many customers who, while they may be all in favor of more industrywide standards, might not want to junk their current systems.    What's more, existing personal computers, especially Apple Computer Inc.'s Macintosh II and new, IBM-compatible models that use Microsoft Corp.'s advanced OS/2 operating system, could compete directly with the Unix personal computers. &quot;Moving Unix machines into the realm of desktop enters a territory that companies like Sun aren't familiar with at all,&quot; says a Microsoft official.    Then there is Sun's penchant for operating at breakneck pace. &quot;They move fast and never look back, and drop companies that can't keep up. Sometimes I wonder how long they can move this fast,&quot; marvels Mr. Katashiba of Fujitsu Microelectronics. Fujitsu wasn't aware, for example, that Sun also intended to license LSI Logic, Cypress and Bipolar to make the Sparc until after the deals were set. &quot;That makes Sun an intriguing and challenging partner,&quot; Mr. Katashiba says, &quot;but it requires us to reconfirm our partnership every time we meet.&quot;    Others just plain don't believe that Sun's particular strategy will play out because advances in communications between computers and the increasing attention to industry standards have already begun to make it easier to mix equipment from various manufacturers. &quot;There will be a multivendor world in the late 1980s and 1990s,&quot; says John Sculley, president and chairman of Apple, &quot;but I believe Sun has grossly overestimated the impact their approach is going to have on it.&quot;    Sun's Mr. McNealy is confident that a standard computer architecture and operating system is inevitable. &quot;The wave is coming, and it doesn't even have to be Sparc,&quot; he says. &quot;But the minute a standard does emerge, you can bet we'll jump on it and ride.&quot;    ---                   Sun's Fundamentals    Stock's 52-week range                  $ 44.38 $24.00    Most recent close                      $ 33.38    Latest annual revenue (June 30, 1987) $537.5 million    Latest annual earnings (June 30, 1987) $ 36.3 million    Employees    6,000                                               ALL FIRMS IN                                        SUN    SAME CATEGORY    1988 Stock price change             -1.9%      4.3%    1987 stock price change             16.4%    -14.0%    R/E ratio                           24.7      18.0    Revenue growth (latest 12 months)  104.8      71.3%    Earnings growth (latest 12 months)  62.2%     14.8%    Profit margin                        6.3%      5.6%    Return on equity                    15.1%     20.8%   Source: Media General Financial Services</TEXT></DOC>
