When she was born 11 weeks premature Nov. 5, Hannah weighed inat 14 ounces, just one ounce more than the nation's smallestsurviving infant. When she left the hospital Saturday, she was arelatively hefty 6 pounds.   During most of her five-month hospital stay, Hannah has beenattached to a respirator, but doctors say her lungs sustainedlittle damage and they have detected no signs of brain damage orother major problems.   ``She has avoided any major complications,'' said neonatologistDr. Dan Hall. ``We have no evidence of any significant lifetimehandicap.''   ``I knew she was a fighter,'' Hannah's mother, Kathy Kotlen, 35,said. ``She's kind of got that inner strength.''   Hannah's father, Morgan Tyler, 42, a professional contractbridge player, said his daughter is alive only because ``thephysicians and staff chose to put out the effort.''   Hannah will continue to receive a small amount of oxygen at homethrough a tube to help aid her growth. A pediatrician will see heronce a week, and a physical therapist will help Hannah's motherdevelop exercises for the child.</TEXT><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sean Connery says he considers himself aHollywood outsider despite his Oscar nomination for best supportingactor in ``The Untouchables.''   ``Well, first of all I am British,'' the actor, who firstachieved fame as the dashing spy James Bond, said in an interviewin the Chicago Tribune.   ``Second, I haven't done mainstream Hollywood pictures; Ihaven't socialized with the `in' crowd. And even with the Bondfilms, I was completely cut out of any involvement in them by theproducers.''   Connery, 57, who plays veteran Irish street cop Jimmy Malone inthe big screen adaptation of federal agent Eliot Ness' pursuit ofgangster Al Capone, said his penchant for suing when he feels hehas been denied a fair share of a movie's profits also hasn'tendeared him to the industry.   Connery has his mind very much on Monday's Oscar ceremony.   ``But the closer it gets, the more you begin to realize thatthere is going to be only one winner,'' he said. ``And that is abit sobering. And so I don't expect ... to jump up and down if myname is called. I'm not going to react as if I had just won thegrand lottery in Spain.''</TEXT><DATELINE>OWENSBORO, Ky.
