But the Kuomintang government's uncharacteristic silence about the student unrest that precipitated Mr. Hu's downfall highlights its fears that a tiny protest movement on Taiwan's own campuses might spread out of control.    The chief spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said publicly that the leadership shakeup in Peking shows that China's political and economic modernization drive is a farce. And privately, many Kuomintang officials also gloated over the repercussions of the pro-democracy demonstrations on the mainland. But they have refrained from openly declaring support for the protesters.    Likewise, the major national dailies have given the demonstrations front-page coverage but have largely ignored them in editorials.    &quot;We have a heavy heart,&quot; says Chang King-yuk, director-general of the Government Information Office, alluding to concern over the persecution of the students. &quot;But we are careful in making our comments and moves.&quot;    Such a low profile may seem out of character for a government that regards developments on the mainland as domestic affairs. But the attitude is based on practical political considerations: If Taipei had backed China's protesters, it would have risked sending the wrong signals to its own restive students.    &quot;(Kuomintang) officials would have a difficult time justifying their suppression of the student protests here if they sided with the mainland students,&quot; says Chang Chung-tung, a history lecturer at National Taiwan University, where the recent Taiwan student protests began.    Like their mainland counterparts, the students here are pushing for greater press freedom and democracy. Although only a few hundred students have become involved, mostly in disputes over campus politics, a comparison of how the Kuomintang and Chinese Communist Party handle student movements reveals remarkable similarities.    Analysts say the protests on both sides of the Taiwan Strait spring from an appetite for democracy -- whetted, in the case of Taiwan, by President Chiang Ching-kuo's promise of political liberalization, and on the mainland by Deng Xiaoping's economic program.    Mr. Chang, the government spokesman, says the mainland student movement was spurred partly by rising expectations as a result of the changes in economic policy. The demonstrations, he says, are part of a continuing process. &quot;You can't put the jinni back into the bottle,&quot; he says.    The same is largely true of the Taipei movement, observers say. Taiwan indisputably enjoys a greater measure of political freedom than China -- yet it was only in October that the door was opened for organized political challenges to one-party rule. Mr. Chang, the university lecturer, says, &quot;If the ban on new parties can be lifted, nothing can prevent the students from demanding the removal of other obstacles to democracy.&quot;    A decision last October by National Taiwan University to ban University News, the campus weekly newspaper, for a year led to a spate of illegal campus protest rallies.    In recent weeks, the students have broadened their demands to include a major reform of the school's administration that aims at removing Kuomintang influence over faculty decisions and the party's scrutiny of students' extracurricular activities. College authorities have promised to review those demands.    &quot;The party wants the students to concentrate on their studies and distance themselves from politics or social movements,&quot; says Mr. Chang, the lecturer. Commenting on the party's efforts to control students' political life, another lecturer says the Kuomintang and China's Communist Party &quot;resemble each other in that regard; the difference is the (Nationalist party) exerts its influence in a less blatant and visible manner.&quot;    That may explain the party's annoyance at such highly visible actions as student protests, analysts say. Like the Peking media's non-coverage of the initial Chinese student demonstrations, Taiwan's two biggest national dailies have for months all but ignored the domestic student unrest. &quot;There is an understanding here that the Kuomintang doesn't want the student movement to attract public attention or sympathy,&quot; says a senior journalist. The papers, China Times and United Daily News, are privately owned by executives who also serve as members of the party's Central Standing Committee.    Taiwan officials have also tried to use fatherly advice to contain the movement. Mr. Chang, the lecturer, says college administrators telephoned parents of leading protesters to try to make them quit the movement. &quot;It made the students angrier,&quot; says Mr. Chang.    Student protests have played a pivotal role in power struggles in China's recent history, a phenomenon that partly explains why both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party are nervous about such agitation, analysts say.    Many years back, nationwide student strikes and demonstrations protesting inflation and charging corruption in the ruling Nationalist government contributed to its eventual defeat on the mainland in 1949. Kuomintang old-timers, who contend that those strikes were instigated by the Communist Party, still fear that the communists will use student movements as a front for China's campaign to reclaim Taiwan. &quot;The lesson was a bitter one for the Kuomintang,&quot; says David Chou, deputy director of the Institute of International Relations.    Even today, says Mr. Chang, the university lecturer, officials frequently provide student activists with the following history lesson: &quot;We lost the mainland because of student movements; you don't want us to lose Taiwan as well.&quot;    The government disputes such a connection. &quot;You absolutely can't link the two events,&quot; an official says. Mr. Chang, the spokesman, says Taipei's cautious response is prompted by concern for the Chinese students' personal safety. An outright declaration of support would present the communists with an excuse to persecute them, he says.    The soft line also highlights the Kuomintang government's inability to influence events in China, despite Taipei's claim of sovereignty over the mainland. &quot;There is little the Kuomintang can say about the student movement because, honestly, there is very little they can do about it,&quot; says Mr. Chou of the Institute of International Relations. </TEXT></DOC>
