The carrier said the pact is valued at more than $1.2 billion (U.S.), including spare parts, training and options on eight more aircraft. The planes will be financed through operating leases, Canadian Airlines said. Boeing Commercial is a unit of Seattle-based Boeing Co.    Delivery will occur between April 1988 and April 1989, the company said. The aircraft will be powered by General Electric Co. engines, will have a range of 6,600 miles and will seat about 210 passengers in a three-class layout.    Last month, Canadian Airlines said it was considering the purchase of additional wide-bodied jets. The company hadn't yet decided between Boeing and European Airbus Industrie. </TEXT></DOC>
