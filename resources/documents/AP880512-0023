While the study dealt with hospitalized patients, the sideeffects are so unpleasant that they could make patients stop takingthe medications once they are discharged, he said.   Doctors must be better trained to spot and treat side effects,while patients and their families must be taught to recognize theproblems and point them out to doctors, Weiden said.   Weiden presented his study Wednesday at the annual meeting ofthe American Psychiatric Association. Similar findings have emergedfrom studies at several psychiatric hospitals, he said.   ``It's cause for concern. It's a good reason for education'' ofdoctors, patients, families and health systems, said John Talbott,chairman of the psychiatry department at the University of MarylandSchool of Medicine and a former president of the association.   The study dealt with side effects of drugs called neuroleptics,which are used to treat hospitalized patients for schizophrenia,manic-depression and severe depression.   The same drugs are used in lower doses for outpatients withschizophrenia and related conditions, and some other illnesses.   Serious side effects are fairly common. One recent study foundthem in about 62 percent of patients on the drugs.   If recognized, the side effects can be treated with othermedications or by reducing dosages of the neuroleptic.   Weiden and colleagues looked for side effects in 48 patientsadmitted to a private psychiatric hospital. They then comparedtheir assessments with those of the doctors treating the patients.   They found that the doctors overlooked side effects in:   _ 20 of 27 patients with akathisia, a physical or mentalrestlessness that can include pacing, leg motion, agitation and theurge to move or flee.   _ 12 of 29 patients with parkinsonism, which includes tremor,rigidity and slowing of movements.   _ two of three patients with acute dystonia, an oftenfrightening attack of muscle contraction that can last severalseconds.   _ nine of 23 patients with akinesia, a decrease in spontaneousmovements and gestures or a zombie-like feeling.   Some unrecognized cases of akinesia were so severe that ``thepatients could hardly move,'' Weiden said.   In rare cases, side effects can be fatal, he said in aninterview.   Doctors overlook side effects for several reasons, Weiden said.   They are not extensively trained in spotting side effects, someof which mimic symptoms of a patient's illness. Working in apsychiatric hospital ward, they also tend to get used to seeing theside effects, he said, and ``you kind of forget how distressing itis.''   In addition, the acutely psychotic patients often cannotcommunicate about the problem effectively, he said.   To improve diagnosis of the side effects, doctors in psychiatricwards should ask specifically about the symptoms, carefully recordthe patient's physical and pharmacological history, and do physicalexminations apart from therapy sessions, Weiden said.   Nurses and doctors should get early training in spotting theproblem, he said.   Jeffrey Lieberman of the Long Island Jewish Medical Center inGlen Oaks, N.Y., said part of the discrepancy Weiden's study foundmight result from different opinions on when symptoms are seriousenough for a diagnosis.   But he agreed that many physicians are not adequately trained onspotting side effects.</TEXT></DOC>
