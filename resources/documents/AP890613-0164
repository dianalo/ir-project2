Theydisrupt the family units, other whales are injured and some arekilled,'' said Edward Morlan, director of the Midwest WhaleProtection Federation.   The federation is one of eight animal rights and environmentalgroups that filed a lawsuit Monday in U.S. District Court inWashington to block the aquarium from importing from Japan threePacific black whales, also known as false killer whales.   The lawsuit comes a week after Canada's government refused theaquarium's request for permission to buy three beluga whales fromHudson Bay-area Eskimos.   Neither species is considered endangered.   Despite the objections, there will be whales in the complex whenit opens in fall 1990, said aquarium Associate Director DavidLonsdale.   ``We were surprised over the controversy,'' Lonsdale said. ``Wefeel we are conservationists. We preach conservation in all of ourmessages.''   He said the Canadians were concerned more about where the whaleswould be kept before the exhibit opened, and not the exhibit spaceitself. The aquarium has said the whales will be housed at anaquarium outside Chicago while its Oceanarium is completed.   The Shedd will reapply for a Canadian permit next year, Lonsdalesaid.   As envisioned, the Oceanarium will be a 170,000-square-footexhibit with a 2 million-gallon pool for the false killer whales anda 400,000-gallon pool for the belugas. The $43 million constructioncost is coming from a variety of sources, including state aid.   The lawsuit said the federal permit Shedd received for importingthe animals from Japan should be revoked until that country bans itsfishermen from killing whales.   The Japanese annually drive false killer whales to shore andslaughter them with harpoons or knives, sparing a few for sale toaquariums, said Sandy Goldberg, an attorney for the Sierra ClubLegal Defense Fund, one of the plaintiffs in the lawsuit.   Ms. Goldberg said the Department of Commerce permit violates aU.S. law banning the importation of marine mammals from countriesthat don't give the animals the same protection they have in theUnited States.   ``We want to protect the wild populations and stop the killingsin Japan,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ``This is no way to do it _ by payingthem to save a few.''   The other plaintiffs are Greenpeace USA, the Humane Society ofthe United States, the American Humane Association, theInternational Wildlife Coalition, the Cetacean Society Internationaland the Animal Protection Institute of America.   Aquarium officials deny any laws were broken. They contend thatif they didn't import the whales, the animals would be slaughtered,and that the exhibits benefit people who have no other place tolearn about the creatures.   ``We're serving an important function,'' Lonsdale said. ``Theeducational value of the exhibits is they help people understandconservationist concerns.''   While the plaintiffs acknowledge the exhibits help increaseawareness of the whales' plight, many say they oppose confiningcreatures that normally range thousands of miles.   Education ``can't take priority over protecting the animals inthe wild,'' Ms. Goldberg said. ``We don't want to protect the whalesby putting them all in aquariums.''   Lonsdale countered that the aquarium handles marine animals withutmost care.   ``We feel we do the best job we can of keeping'' the animals, hesaid. ``Their life here is very good. They have a very pleasantexistence.''</TEXT></DOC>
