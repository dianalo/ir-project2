Birnbaum (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> MANHESTER, Iowa  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Presidential candidate Jack Kemp is brimming with excitement as he promotes his favorite subject: moving U.S. currency toward a gold standard.    &quot;It would make the world economy more efficient, more productive,&quot; he says, his voice rising with every phrase. &quot;It's the seedcorn, it's the future of jobs, it's the future for education. It will expand the economy of the world!&quot;    The torrent of words is met with a puzzled silence by the sparse audience here in the West Delaware County Middle School. &quot;I know this is a lot to absorb,&quot; Mr. Kemp says, apologetically. Later, he explains, &quot;What do you do when you don't get a big crowd? Every once in a while you get inspired.&quot;    The impassioned congressman from the Buffalo, N.Y., suburbs is inspired a lot these days, as he carries his upbeat message through the early caucus and primary states of Iowa and New Hampshire. Mr. Kemp is the Happy Warrior of the Republican Party -- a rebel with a cause who is fighting to find a following.    Rep. Kemp once was considered a leading contender to win the GOP nomination, and his advisers urged him to become more mainstream by eschewing such controversial issues as tying the dollar's value to a fixed quantity of gold or other commodities. But over the past year, Vice President George Bush and Sen. Robert Dole have dominated the race, and Mr. Kemp has slipped into the second tier of candidates.    The adversity seems to be liberating Mr. Kemp to speak his mind, and some see him positioned to be this year's surprise success story. Polls show him climbing in popularity in New Hampshire, a state with a penchant for backing underdogs. But he needs to either win or make a very strong showing in the early contests to survive against his better-financed opponents, and he faces an uphill struggle here in Iowa.    Mr. Kemp is undeterred and now, in the closing days before the first political tests of 1988, he is moving with an almost frantic sense of urgency. &quot;This is not a campaign,&quot; he implores a roomful of volunteers in Cedar Rapids, Iowa. &quot;This is a cause.&quot; Later, in an interview, he adds: &quot;I'm not as well known. I'm not as well financed. But I believe this stuff. I really do.&quot;    Rep. Kemp's pitch is pure optimism that combines supply-side economics -- a low-tax-rate creed that he helped create -- with stiff anti-communism. He preaches a gospel of growth and unshackled capitalism as the panacea for most economic ills. And, unlike the GOP front-runners, he espouses a populism that seeks to reach out to nontraditional Republicans.    He tends to speak in hyperbole, lumping any number of complex ideas into a rapidfire blur. &quot;I want to emphasize the fact that there are answers to our problems. There are no limits to what we can accomplish,&quot; he tells a group gathered in the Ritz Steak House in Dyersville, Iowa. &quot;No one in this campaign is more optimistic.&quot;    Mr. Kemp asserts that his policies can lure virtually everyone into the Republican fold, including blacks who currently vote overwhelmingly Democratic. &quot;I am the kind of Republican,&quot; he says, &quot;who can speak at union halls and factory gates and on farms and in senior-citizen homes and in churches and synagogues.&quot;    On foreign affairs, Mr. Kemp describes himself as a &quot;heavily armed dove,&quot; and in fact is one of the Pentagon's staunchest defenders. He preaches the need to support the world's democratic regimes against communism, and is a vigorous advocate for the Strategic Defense Initiative, the anti-missile system also known as Star Wars. He also opposes the recent intermediate-range nuclear arms treaty until the Soviets comply with previous treaties.    The cornerstone of his dream for international economic growth, besides lower marginal tax rates, is the need to tie the U.S. exchange rate to a stable benchmark level. &quot;The single most overriding issue in America,&quot; he tells his audience at the Ritz Steak House, &quot;is the need for systemic change in the way we value our money.&quot;    Mr. Kemp sees his message as the raw meat for a brand of conservatism that is the rightful successor to Ronald Reagan's. Mr. Kemp's chief opponents deride it as a placebo, as nothing more than the former quarterback's political &quot;end-around&quot; on the most pressing problems of the day, such as the budget and trade deficits.    Perhaps Sen. Dole captures the anti-Kemp argument best when he calls him the candidate of the &quot;free lunch.&quot; In response, Mr. Kemp says he doesn't worship at the altar of deficit reduction and austerity, and instead believes that the budget deficit can be tamed by limiting some spending and by using tax incentives and a stable dollar to encourage economic growth.    What's more, Rep. Kemp's open-armed populist style is anathema to some right-wing leaders who exclude certain types of people and beliefs from their world. Mr. Kemp isn't a hater, and he concedes that his refusal to target his message to more conventional conservative groups has gotten him into &quot;trouble.&quot;    So far it's difficult to see that Mr. Kemp's platform is striking a responsive chord in Iowa. Light crowds meet him during a recent visit here, and those who do show up greet him with many quizzical glances. People go away from his speeches convinced that he believes deeply in what he says, but aren't exactly sure what that is.    &quot;He was mentioning all these nice things real fast -- way too fast,&quot; says David Kollins, a freshman at the Des Moines Area Community College. Adds another bewildered freshman, Daniel Reed: &quot;It would be pretty good . . . I guess . . . sort of.&quot;    The issue that is getting the most blank stares from audiences is his call to make money &quot;as good as gold.&quot; After a luncheon speech in Dubuque, real estate broker Eric Schulz concludes. &quot;It's hard for the average person to grasp. It's a little over my head.&quot;    Mr. Kemp is also on the attack on less esoteric issues. For example, he has stung Messrs. Bush and Dole with accusations (which they deny) that they are bent on reducing Social Security benefits. Mr. Bush became so angry with one Kemp assault on his anti-abortion record that he publicly tore up a Kemp flier on the subject and proclaimed, &quot;Finis.&quot;    But Mr. Kemp appears distinctly uncomfortable as the negativist. He is at full stride when he is sounding the clarion call for his own version of economic revolution. In Dyersville, his eyes light up when he importunes the audience: &quot;Help us change the world!&quot;    Back in Washington, Mr. Kemp's aides possess the same fervor. Waving a leaflet advocating the gold standard, Jeffrey Bell, national campaign coordinator, says proudly, &quot;That's really coming out of the closet isn't it?&quot; He adds: &quot;They're going to call us nuts anyway, so we might as well get the up-side.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
