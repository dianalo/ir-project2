The finding was made using a strain of mutant mice that lose their hair beginning soon after birth. The researchers employed DNA probes, small pieces of genetic material that stick to and help identify the locations of genes, to pinpoint the position within mouse DNA of genetic material that is always present in the hairless mice but not in normal ones.    Thus, the researchers believe they have located a gene crucial for hair growth. That gene apparently is disabled by the presence of the genetic material -- which causes the hairless mutation -- that was pinpointed by the scientists. More research will be needed to clarify the structure and metabolic function of the suspected hair-growth gene, the researchers said.    The finding, by researchers at Tufts University and at the University of Sydney, Australia, was reported in the July 29 issue of the journal Cell.    The implications of the finding for human research aren't yet known. But there are many similarities between human and animal DNA, and the researchers said finding the hair-growth gene in mice may help in the search for genes associated with human hair growth and baldness.    &quot;I would be amazed if there wasn't&quot; a similar human gene associated with hair growth in humans, said John Coffin, one of the researchers. &quot;Whether it will also be associated with hair loss in humans remains to be seen.&quot;    The finding doesn't mean scientists are close to a treatment for hair loss that would involve replacing a defective gene; techniques to do that are still many years ahead. But it could lead to a better understanding of the metabolic processes controlled by the hair-growth gene. And that might suggest new drugs that would alter such processes that cause baldness.    Besides its implications for research on human hair growth and loss, the finding showed the power of a new technique for locating particular genes within the maze of genetic material.    To pinpoint the hairless gene, the scientists used DNA probes derived from &quot;proviruses,&quot; copies of genetic material that have been inserted within animal DNA by certain viruses, called retroviruses, that have infected the animals. Their work suggests that the genetic defect that causes the hair loss in mice originally was caused by viral infection. </TEXT></DOC>
