The Social Democratic Party is one of nearly two dozen new orreformed parties preparing for the contested elections, which willbe the first since the Communists consolidated power in 1948.   Leaders of the new faction, calling itself the IndependentSocial Democratic Party, accused their rivals of bourgeoistendencies. The accusations came on the second day of a congresscalled to plan election strategies.   Spokeswoman Anna Petrasovits of the mainstream factioncriticized the breakaway group, saying it seeks alliances with``the East European left.''   ``We represent the (West) European left,'' she told Hungariantelevision.   One of the issues that split the Social Democratic Party waswhether or not to cooperate with the Socialist Party, whichreplaced the Communist Party when it was disbanded last month.   The Socialist Party professed democratic ideals but is stillheaded by leaders of the defunct Communist Party.</TEXT></DOC>
