Judge Richard A. Niehaus of Hamilton County Common Pleas Courtsaid he would accept objections to the proposed settlement and makea final ruling on May 6.   The state blamed the firm for negligence in auditing HomeState's books, which Ohio officials said contributed to the March1985 collapse of the Cincinnati-based thrift. Arthur Andersendenied the state's allegations and admitted no wrongdoing inreaching the settlement.   The settlement was reached April 15, after the case already hadgone to trial in the Ohio Court of Claims in Columbus. The case isbefore Niehaus because he has jurisdiction over the state'sliquidation of Home State.   The case is one of numerous civil suits the state filed in itsefforts to recover costs of guaranteeing all the deposits of HomeState after its collapsed. Home State was closed for three monthsuntil another company bought and reopened it in June 1985, allowingdepositors to get their money back.   Home State collapsed three days after the U.S. Securities andExchange Commission had ESM Government Securities Inc., asecurities trader in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., closed for bankruptcywith more than $300 million in debts. Home State was ESM's biggestinvestor through securities transactions, and lost $144 millionbecause of ESM's closing.   Home State's failure caused a statewide crisis for 69 other Ohiosavings and loans insured by the private Ohio Deposit GuaranteeFund of Cincinnati, which was weakened when Home State drainedbackup money to cope with losses and withdrawals by panickeddepositors.   A number of Home State and ESM have since been convicted ofcrimes in connection with the failure of the two institutions.</TEXT></DOC>
