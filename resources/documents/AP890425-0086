Cheney, making his first appearance as defense secretary beforehis former colleagues in the House, told the Armed ServicesCommittee that only the Marine Corps had been spared manpower cuts.   ``No program was excluded from consideration during the budgetadjustment process,'' Cheney told the House panel at the start ofwhat was expected to be a day-long hearing.   ``But my top priorities are quality people, forward strategy,readiness and sustainability, efficient procurement and strategicmodernization. The adjustments we made to the budget wereimplemented within this context.''   Under the budget agreement reached earlier this spring betweenthe Bush administration and Congress, the Pentagon is required tocut future spending plans by $10 billion for the next fiscal year.   Cheney said that in making the budget changes, ``not only did wehave to make hard choices, but we also had to make sure that theywere the right choices.''   Funding for Star Wars research has been cut by $1 billion to anew total of $4.6 billion for fiscal 1990, Cheney said.   He said the Navy would retire or transfer to the reserves oneaircraft carrier, seven destroyers and 10 frigates, and that theAir Force would lose its new F-15E ground-attack jet and delayproduction of the new B-2 stealth bomber.   The Army has been told to cancel production of AH-64 Apachehelicopters after fiscal 1991. The Marine Corps has been told toscrap development of its new V-22 transport aircraft. The Navy hasbeen ordered to defer some purchases of the F-A-18 jet fighter andto cancel its planned last purchase of an SSN-688 nuclear attacksubmarine.   Cheney, who took office a month ago, said he had ordered a cutin active military strength totaling 16,800 positions, down to atotal of 2,121,500. Of those cuts, 8,000 will come from the Army,5,600 from the Navy, and 3,200 from the Air Force, the defensechief said.   A request for a 3.6 percent pay raise in fiscal 1990 for armedservices personnel has been left intact, Cheney said, and trainingfunds would not be cut.   On the nuclear-missile question, Cheney said President Bush haddecided to move ahead with two kinds of mobile, strategic missiles_ the larger, 10-warhead MX missile and the single-warheadMidgetman.   Cheney had recommended moving the nation's 50 MX missiles fromsilos to deployment on railroad cars rather than developing theMidgetman. But Bush opted for quick deployment of the MX andresearch-and-development funding for the Midgetman.   ``Further development of the Midgetman wastes funds that aresorely needed for other defense programs,'' Sen. Pete Wilson,R-Calif., a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said ofthe compromise decision.   But Rep. Bill Dickinson of Alabama, ranking Republican on theHouse Armed Services Committee, said he had no problem with theplan. ``The main thing is to preserve and protect the assets we'vegot, which is MX in silos, and then go forward and make themmobile.''   Congressional Republicans over the years have favored the MXwhile many Democrats prefer the Midgetman.   Warner, a backer of the compromise proposal, said it was hisopinion that the plan ``will move through the Hill reasonablysmoothly,'' because of its bipartisan support.   The Virginia Republican said the MX-Midgetman plan has thesupport of Democrat Sam Nunn of Georgia, chairman of the SenateArmed Services Committee, and Rep. Les Aspin, D-Wis., chairman ofthe House Armed Services Committee.   Cheney's recommendation for Star Wars spending of $4.6 billioncompares to a total of $5.9 billion proposed by former PresidentReagan. In total, spending for Star Wars, formally known as theStrategic Defense Initiative, would be $33 billion over five years,compared to the $40 billion proposed by Reagan.   ``The Star Wars funding level is keeping pace with thetechnology that's moving now in several directions,'' said Sen.John Warner of Virginia, ranking Republican on the Senate ArmedServices Committee.   Dickinson said the spending proposal for Star Wars ``is notgoing to be such a cut that it will permanently wreck the program.It still gives a viable, reasonable program, particularly if theydon't press for early deployment.''   Cheney said the focus of Star Wars will shift from deploymentsometime in the 1990s to research on ``Brilliant Pebbles,'' a moreadvanced system consisting of thousands of orbiting satellites.   The defense secretary also said the Pentagon would delay workfor one year on the B-2 stealth bomber, which at recent estimatesof $500 million per plane makes it the most expensive aircraft inhistory. Original plans called for purchasing 132.   ``The stretch-out on the B-2 is not that bad in that it wasgoing to slip some anyway for technical reasons,'' said Dickinson.</TEXT></DOC>
