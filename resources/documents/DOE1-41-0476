Strength and porosity data indicated that the cementing actionof the mixtures was, in all cases, inferior to portland cement. For eachmixture the strength loss resulting from imperfect curing, i.e. sealedor exposed to 50% relative humidity, was greater than for portland cement.In the case of concrete drying from one surface, strength differenceswere found, but there were not as clearly defined as those obtained inthe paste specimens.</TEXT></DOC>
