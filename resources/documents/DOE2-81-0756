The existence of nine borides known before is confirmed (TbCo/sub4/B, Tb/sub 3/Co/sub 11/B/sub 4/, Tb/sub 2/Co/sub 7/B/sub 3/, TbCo/sub12/B/sub 6/, TbCo/sub 3/B/sub 2/, TbCo/sub 2/B/sub 2/, TbCo/sub 4/B/sub4/, Tb/sub 5-x/Co/sub 2+x/B/sub 6/ and TbCoB/sub 4/) and two new boridesare found (Tb/sub 2/Co/sub 5/B/sub 2/, Tb/sub 4/CoB/sub 13/). The structuresimilar to Er/sub 4/NiB/sub 13/ is diffractometrically established forTb/sub 4/CoB/sub 13/ (sp. gr. P4/mnc, a=0.7235(2), c=0.7535(2)). Thediffraction pattern of Tb/sub 2/Co/sub 5/B/sub 2/ is indexed in rhombohedralsyngony (a=0.5106(2), c=3.0122(13)), however, the structure is not fullydetermined.</TEXT></DOC>
