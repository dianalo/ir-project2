(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>The December 1989 issue (Vol.andP;  8, No.andP;  5) of The outlook contained an articlewhich examined standardization activities that will eventually make Unix moreattractive by reducing the confusion caused by the rapid proliferation ofgraphical user interfaces (GUIs) for Unix.andP;  As usual, the computing industryis not in a holding pattern waiting for these standards to materialize.andP;  Inthis article we will report on two interesting and complementary developmentswhich are likely to accelerate the introduction of Unix into PC professionalcomputing environments.andM;Over the last four months, practically every PC vendor has licensed one ofthe two leading Motif- compliant Unix GUI desktop products (i.e., X.desktopor Looking Glass).andP;  During this period we have also seen a new trend emergingfor PC vendors to address the Unix installation morass by offering completeturnkey PC-Unix hardware/software packages.andP;  Now let's take a closer look ata plug-and-play PC-Unix implementation which claims to offer first time Unixusers a safe and enjoyable experience.andM;The IXI X.desktop SoftwareandM;IXI Limited, a developer and supplier of X Window System-related softwareproducts, headquartered in Cambridge, England, had its flagship productX.desktop demonstrated by 18 vendors at UniForum '90 in Washington in January(including biggies like IBM, NCR and SCO).andP;  IXI was founded in 1987 andX.desktop 2.0 was first licensed in June, 1988.andP;  The latest generationproduct, X.desktop 2.0, announced in November, 1989, is an OSF/Motifcompliant desktop manager that incorporates object-oriented managementfacilities similar to those found in Hewlett-Packard's New Wave graphicaluser interface for DOS.andP;  X.desktop 2.0 provides these features for Unixusers.andM;X.desktop is an X/Open POSIX conforming program, written in ANSI C, whichuses MIT's X Window System library and toolkit to control the user's screen.andO;You may choose one of the popular XWindow managers (e.g., Motif WindowManager or Open Look Window Manager), or run the X.desktop Window Manager.andO;The X Window manager sits between the operating system and the applicationprogram and defines how application programs can communicate with the user ina graphical and visual way.andP;  The system requirements for running X.desktopare as follows:andM;4Mb total RAM  minimum)- 4Mb available disk space; Xlib X11.3 or later; XServer Xl 1.2 or later; 1 to 5 button mouse; 64Ox320 or higher screen.andM;X.desktop 2.0 retail versions are available for the major Unix workstationplatforms, including Mac II, and Intel 80386-based PCs, directly fromUniPress Software in the U.S.andP;  for $495 per single user.andM;The DELL Station 325andM;In March, IXI Limited announced a new licensing agreement with Dell ComputerCorporation (9505 Arboretum Blvd, Austin, TX 78759-9969;800-284-7766) wherebyX.desktop 2.0 will be included with the DELL Station 325 and DELL Station426E, two Unix/ DOS workstations based on Dell's high performance 80386 or80486-based personal computers.andP;  Dell adopted INA's X.desktop to provide aGUI (Macintosh-like) working environment for the non-technical user.andP;  TheDELL Station is targeted for general business use.andP;  It combines a Dell Systemwith a preloaded suite of software packages that includes the Dell UnixOperating System, the X Window System, X.desktop 2.0, the Uniplex suite ofoffice automation software, and software to concurrently access MS-DOSapplications.andM;The Dell Unix Operating System is based on a version of unix developed byATandamp;T known as Unix System V/386, Release 3.2.andP;  Interactive SystemsCorporation enhanced UnixSystem V/386 to produce the 386/ix operating system,which Dell further enhanced in a number of ways including (1) adding supportfor the OSF/Motif user interface, (2) adding and tuning display devicedrivers to maximize performance on Dell designed video adapters, and (3)adding utilities to allow users to customize various display and keyboardparameters.andM;The Dell Station used for our evaluation consisted of a Decll System 325which is based on the Intel 80386 running at 25MHz.andP;  With an all inclusivesingle user price of $8999, a basic DELL Station configuration (shown inFigure 1) is competitively priced.andP;  The 486 version with a 150 MB tape driveis priced at $11,999.andP;  While our use of the DELL Station was limited to thatof a single-user Unix PC, the DELL Station can be configured as an X Windowhost computer, a multi-user microcomputer, or a PC network server.andM;In a future report we intend to take a closer look at the Unix-based businesssoftware running on the DELL Station, including the bundled Uniplex officesoftware as well as popular packages such as Word Perfect which have beenported to run under Unix.andP;  We also hope to use the DELL Station to explorethe DOS/Unix connection in a future review of Visionware's PC-Connectsoftware.andP;  However, this review focuses on Dell's implementation of X.desktopfrom the perspective of a standalone PC user who has no knowledge of Unix,and no desire to perform the unnatural act of learning the cryptic Unixcommand language.andM;InstallationandM;DELL Station hardware and software options are factory installed andcustom-configured at the time of order.andM;According to the installation literature, the first time you use the DELLStation, a special setup routine guides you through the initializationprocedure.andP;  On a single user DELL Station, the end user is responsible foradministrative tasks.andP;  The only mandatory administrative task during setupinvolves (1) defining login names and associated passwords, (2) sayingwhether or not you want to use VP/ix which allows you to run MS-DOS programsfrom within Unix, and (3) activating the Uniplex software.andP;  A flaw in thefactory setup of our machine caused the login administrative step to beskipped.andP;  Our first exposure to Unix consisted of a &quot;Weleome to the X WindowsSystem&quot; message and a prompt to enter a login and a password.andP;  Everycombination of logins and passwords which we could think of was greeted with&quot;Login failed, please try again.&quot; The technical support people at Dell werevery helpful, and after playing &quot;Super User&quot; and issuing a few Unix commandsfrom the root directory, we were back in sync with the &quot;Getting Started withthe DELL Station&quot; guide.andP;  The guide contains all you should normally need toknow to set up the DELL Station as quickly as possible.andP;  It also does a goodjob of explaining the structure of the DELL Station software and providesbasic Unix system terminology.andP;  In addition, Dell offers systemadministration via both a 1-800 number and modem.andM;Once a successful installation is completed, you are automatically presentedwith the X Windows login screen.andP;  However, at two and one- half minutes, theboot process will seem excessively long to DOS users.andM;The Dell X.desktop User interfaceandM;Once you have successfully logged onto the system, the cursor changes from anX to an hourglass and the Motif Root Window, with nothing but a clock in theupper right-hand corner, appears.andP;  A few seconds later, the IXI X.desktopappears.andP;  The initial Dell X.desktop is a window with a title bar, threebuttons, and 10 icons representing entry points to your filing system (Homeand Root), Unix utilities (Supplies and Unix SysAdm), Uniplex applicationsand online Help, Printer, and Trash facilities.andP;  While the &quot;feel&quot; or behaviorof the X.desktop user interface closely resembles Microsoft Windows and PM,the three-dimensional Motif widgets pioneered by Hewlett Packard provide itwith a distinctive &quot;look.&quot;andM;Incidentally, the DELL Station X.desktop implementation is designed to workwith a two-button mouse.andM;The Motif Root Menu gives you access to current DELL Station features.andP;  Toaccess the Motif Root Menu, you move the mouse pointer to any currentlyexposed gray desktop background area and press the left mouse button.andP;  Anattractively designed pop-up menu appears allowing access to the following:Uniplex Windows; DOS Windows; Calculator; Clock; VI Editor; Refresh; Restart;and Quit/Logout.andP;  You must keep the mouse button held down to keep the RootMenu on the screen, and we did not find anyway to select options by means ofthe keyboard.andP;  A new user must be able to come to grips with this &quot;slippery&quot;mousy window very quickly since it contains the only graceful way forperforming a proper shutdown required by Unix.andP;  It seems more appropriate tohave this important menu always present and visible, instead of as a windowcontaining a clock.andM;The Dell version of X.desktop runs under the standard Motif Window Manager,which displays and controls the windows on the desktop, and provides theoperations of moving, resizing, reordering, and closing windows.andP;  The windowcontrol boxes (Control Menu, Iconize  Maximize) at the top of each windowprovide essentially the same functions as their counterparts on a MicrosoftWindows desktop.andP;  For example, mouse selecting the left-most icon (givingpositive feedback in the form of a 3-D indentation effect) presents you witha drop down menu containing all the window control options buttons in thesame sequence as its Microsoft Windows counterpart.andP;  The Motif Window Managerdoes provide an additional option called &quot;Lower&quot; which pops the window to thebottom of the stack of open windows.andP;  The minimize and maximize boxes on theright side of the window also mimic the Microsoft Windows implementation.andO;The Control Menu can also be called by pressing the right mouse buttonanywhere within the window title bar.andP;  Keyboard equivalents are provided foreach of the items on the Control Menu box.andP;  For example, you can close awindow by pressing the &quot;c&quot; key or holding down the Alt-key while pressing theF4 key (the menu docs not need to be visible-a shortcut key).andP;  Although theoption label is shown as Close to indicate that a press of the  C&quot; key willclose the window, only a lower-case &quot;c&quot; will work.andP;  This is an example of aUnix world peculiarity regarding case sensitivity.andP;  This is likely to causeseemingly unexplainable difficulties for DOS users in many yet to be seensituations.andM;A favorable first impression of the Dell X.desktop's &quot;look&quot; is facilitated bywell-designed and interesting graphic icons.andP;  The use of professionallycrafted icons that help users to quickly grasp the meaning of, and todifferentiate between informational objects is a strength which is exploitedthroughout the X.desktop implementation.andP;  For example, a special icon showinga pair of reading glasses next to a file folder indicates that it is a&quot;read-only&quot; file (see illustration).andP;  An icon immediately recognizable as anoffice supply cabinet provides direct access to frequently used &quot;objects.&quot;andO;The supply cabinet initially comes stocked with a large collection of popularUnix utilities, but it can be easily modified to fit individual work stylesand preferences.andM;Unlike most of the popular GUI desktops, including the Macintosh, GEM,Microsoft Windows and PM, which make use of pull-down menu bars to accessdesktop functions, Dell's version of X.desktop provides a single pop-upDesktop Menu with two slideout submenus to access functions such as viewingdetailed information about a selected file, selecting groups of files,tidying up the desktop, and on-line help.andP;  One of the submenus providesaccess to applications including the Unix shell, clock, calculator and theUnix vi editor.andP;  The Desktop Menu is summoned at the current cursor positionby pressing the right mouse button while the main desktop is the activewindow.andP;  If you have more than one window open on the screen, the activewindow is the one with the green title bar, and you can make any windowactive with a single click of the left mouse button anywhere in the window.andO;A click of the right mouse button in an active file directory window bringsup the Directory Menu.andP;  As seen in the very middle of the X.desktopillustration, the Directory Menu provides a full range of file managementfunctions including creating directories, copying, moving, viewing (iconic ortext), sorting and deleting files.andM;X.desktop provides a nice direct-manipulation technique which they call the&quot;drop action metaphor.&quot; A user selects an icon with a mouse and simply movesit over to another icon to manipulate it.andP;  While this is not a new technique(i.e., many GUIs handle the &quot;trashing&quot; function by dragging objects to bedeleted to a trash can icon), X.desktop makes extensive and effective use ofthis relatively intuitive metaphor.andP;  To edit a report, you can drag a datafile icon over to the WP icon.andP;  To print, move, COPY, archive, delete,compress, convert, or transmit files, you drag them to the appropriateprogram icon.andM;The file search implementation is a good example of the effective use of thedrop action metaphor.andP;  To perform a search for a particular file, you candrag any icon representing one or more files over to a clearly labeled andgraphically meaningful icon.andP;  One of these is an icon labelled &quot;Find&quot; showinga hand flipping through a stack of pages (as seen high-lighted in theX.desktop illustration).andP;  Dropping the file onto the Find icon brings up aMotif Prompt box which prompts you for a filename.andP;  Here we see an example ofhow the Motif 3-D effects go beyond pizazz by adding useful visual cues.andP;  Itis easy to identify user input fields in a Motif screen, since they areconsistently represented by an indented box (as seen on the right side of theX.desktop illustration).andM;The Dell X.desktop implementation which we evaluated did not implement all ofthe features in the standard distribution version of X.desktop.andP;  For example,the useful Focus Lock Button, which is used to lock keyboard input into aparticular window, is missing.andP;  The Bitmap editor, which allows you to createyour own icons for files, is missing from the Applications submenu.andP;  Alsomissing is the animation of icons to indicate that the desired action istaking place, such as a trash can which bulges as the file is dropped ontothe trash icon.andP;  Finally, selection of the Help option from the Desktop Menuproduced a message saying, &quot;There is no on-line help on this system.&quot;andM;The most serious problem which we experienced with the DELL Station userinterface design was the potential for eye strain associated with readingtextual information on the screen first supplied with our evaluation system.andO;Basically, the default text fonts used most often for the DELL Stationimplementation (including the X.desktop menu nomenclature) are just too smalland delicate (whimpy) for comfortable reading at a normal viewing distance.andO;Things get a lot worse when the normal black-on-white presentation isdeserted for lower contrast text-background combinations, such as theblack-on-blue menu option nomenclature employed on all the X.desktop pop-upmenus, and the black-on-green window titles.andP;  This was not a problem with theevaluated Dell display hardware, which consisted of a very high quality16-inch monitor and Super VGA controller capable of displaying a 1024 x 768image with 256 colors.andP;  It was more a problem of trying to display too manylines and rows of text on a color CRT.andM;More than twice as many rows and columns of text are displayed than arenormally seen in an equivalent screen area for a typical DOS-based wordprocessor text presentation.andP;  This is typical of the misuse of highresolution color screens we so often see in the Unix workstation world.andP;  Itis not uncommon to see a programmer straining to read listings displayed in6-point fonts on a high-powered graphics workstation.andP;  As for the DELLStation, the bolder 10-pitch fonts used for the Motif Window Manager menuoption labels provide acceptable legibility and should be used as thestandard text type.andP;  In addition, a user should be able to easily select froma range of text sizes and fonts via simple menu selections without coming indirect contact with Unix.andM;Considering the various software products encompassed by the DELL Stationuser interface implementation, it is not surprising that the first offeringhas some look and feel inconsistencies which detract from its overallusability.andP;  As an example, scrolling is not implemented in a consistentfashion.andP;  First, the Motif window containing the main desktop has no built-inscrolling feature at all.andP;  If there are more items on the desktop thanvisible in the window (you are given no indication that this is the case) youcan only make them visible by growing the window.andP;  Windows activated from theroot X.desktop have the nicest scrolling implementation.andP;  They come with bothhorizontal and vertical full function Motif scroll bars, complete with theuseful keyboard assisted jumpto-end and jump-to-beginning by using the Shiftkey in conjunction with the left-mouse button.andP;  On the other hand, a MotifUnix shell window has a bar down the left side instead of the right, andscrolling can only be accomplished by use of the right-mouse button, andscrolling via the keyboard and horizontal scrolling are missing.andM;Finally, X.desktop makes use of Alert Windows to keep the user informed aboutwhat it is doing, and to present messages explaining what you should do whenthings go wrong.andP;  In general, the information is helpful and polite in tone.andO;However, its &quot;nerdish&quot; Unix heritage sometimes surfaces.andP;  How about an alertwindow titled &quot;Fatal&quot; and containing the message &quot;Stopping X.desktop.andO;X.desktop has been killed by a signal&quot;? You are not likely to see this typeof message in today's kinder and more gentle world's shrink-wrapped DOSsoftware.andM;Customizing X.desktopandM;A potentially nice feature of X.desktop is that its behavior and appearanceare not fixed, but are determined by configuration files which can be editedto suit individual requirements, or specific applications not catered to bythe default configuration.andP;  The default behavior of X.desktop is determinedby a system rule file which determines most aspects of X.desktop behaviorincluding:-Icon appearance and title, icon activation, what happens when anicon is mouse selected, and what happens when another icon is dropped ontoit.andP;  - Directory appearance, what picture is used to create the backgroundpattern for the directory window.-Drop behavior, what happens when one ormore icons are dragged into a directory window.andP;  - Menu appearance andbehavior, what happens when a menu item is selected.-Desktop layout, whichfiles are on the desktop, and their desktop positions.-Locked files, whichdesktop files are permanently locked.andM;While it is nice to know that it is possible to modify just about any aspectof the X.desktop behavior to fit your preferences and the way you like towork, it is unfortunate that IXI has not been able to provide the sort ofhigher level interface customization tools which we are accustomed to seeingin the DOS and Macintosh environments.andP;  Modification of the X.desktop defaultsettings assumes that you are familiar with using the Unix shell language.andM;A quick browse though the X.desktop 2.0 Configuration Guide will convince youto make friends with a computer science graduate if you have any desire tomake even the simplest change to the standard X.desktop user interface.andO;According to Anil Malhotra, IXI's VP of Sales andamp; Marketing, IXI will be makingsome improvements in this area very shortly.andP;  Until then, the interfacecustomization can be viewed as a programming environment for the corporateprogramming staff and VARs to adapt it to their respective users' needs.andM;ConclusionsandM;First, the Dell people are to be commended on their strategy for introducingUnix to a wider spectrum of business users by providing a plug-and-playimplementation designed to keep first-time users from dropping into thatfour-letter word.andP;  Unix.andP;  Only Joe Isuzu, or a programmer who is not wise inthe ways of the real world, might suggest that contact with raw Unix is goodfor you.andP;  Since we were a pre-release user of the full DELL Station package,we had a close brush with Unix and now know how Indiana Jones felt with thatgigantic boulder bearing down on him.andM;The DELL Station is well positioned to meet the requirements that manybusinesses have for improved departmental office workgroup computing andcommunications.andP;  Most of the shortcomings we observed with the DELL Stationimplementation can be overcome by more attention to detail in the design ofuser interfaces.andP;  The main problem at the moment is a lack of X Windows/Motifcompliant-based business applications.andP;  While it may be useful and relativelyeasy to make some of the better Unix- based business applications to rununder X Windows, what is really needed to maximize the current investment inDOS applications and training are Unix/Motif ports of the most popular DOSbusiness packages.andM;The IXA X.desktop software plays a critical role in shielding the DELLStation user from the dreaded Unix prompt.andP;  Additionally, we believe thatIXI's Motif-based X.desktop will play a more general role in stimulating Unixmarket growth within the business computing sector.andP;  An appearance andbehavior consistent with that of Microsoft Windows and OS/2 PresentationManager is making it one of the main X Window GUIs of choice among developersof both PC and workstation systems.andP;  As such, X.desktop is serving as abridge between the PC and workstation environment, making it more attractivefor organizations to network their high performance workstations and PCs.andM;Finally, we were very impressed with Dell's System 325 personal computer.andO;Its microprocessor capability, combined with an advanced cache memorycontroller and high performance disk drives make the System 325 a good choiceas a platform for bringing the power of Unix into the PC world.andP;  Consideringthe computing demands of a Unix environ ment with X Windows and GUIoverheads, use of a less capable PC could easily doom an initial expeditioninto the world of Unix.andM;Figure 1.andM;DELL Station 325andM;Specifications:andM;*Intel 80386 CPU @ 25MHzandM;*Intel 82385 cache memoryandM;*ISA BussandM;*8 MB memoryandM;*5.25 &quot;
