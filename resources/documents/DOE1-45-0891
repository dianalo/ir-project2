Over halfof all workers (about 70) reported watery itchy eyes, sneezing, or runnystuff noses. Symptoms of skin rashes, cough, chest tightness, and shortnessof breath were also reported throughout the facility. Dust concentrationswere highest in the composition area, where all workers experienced irritationof eyes, nose, and throat, and a few developed occupational asthma confirmedby company physicians. Workers were exposed to several vitamin productswhich were irritating to eyes and nasal and respiratory mucosa becauseof acidity. Some workers became hypersensitive to dusts due to proteinand polysaccharide contents. Most samples showed total and respirabledust measurements well below Occupational Safety and Health Administrationpermissible exposure limits for nuisance dusts. However, these are notcommon nuisance dust components. The authors suggest that the limitsprovide little protection for average workers exposed to such dusts.Asbestos sampling revealed potential hazard from falling insulation.Recommendations pertaining to local exhaust hoods, amended work practices,use of personal dust respirators, avoidance of skin contact, and properceiling insulation are offered.</TEXT></DOC>
