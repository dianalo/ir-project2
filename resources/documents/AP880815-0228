The man actually enjoys the job.   Everything about Reagan shows his pleasure with the best role ofhis actor's life. It's in his body language. He bounds onstage forspeeches; he looks interested in the other guy's speech; he laughsat every punch line. His wave to crowds is never forced. Amiabilityis his strong suit.   Used to taking orders from directors in his earlier career,Reagan has surrounded himself with aides to whom he delegates muchauthority. That enables him to be what he said he would be, a9-to-5 executive who does not take work home.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sometime in the next 48 hours, perhaps asthis newspaper is being delivered to your doorstep, George Bushwill announce with a perfectly straight face that the fog hascleared and he has lit upon a running mate.   And then we will wait for an annoucement.   Mercifully, we will not have to wait long. The tease has to endthis week because the television show ends this week.   Bush wants the ratings not for his ego, but to increase hischances of overtaking Michael Dukakis. The Republicans are hopingfor audiences of 20-odd million people each night and they plan touse the forum to launch a broad attack on the Democratic nominee.Of course, this contrived drama has some of the supporting playersjumping through hoops.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   While conservative leaders agitate for arunning mate of their persuasion, delegates to the RepublicanNational Convention are content to leave the choice to George Bush_ be it man, woman, or ``800-pound gorilla.''   ``Do you think George Bush is out there looking for anabortionist liberal who wants to raise taxes?'' asked formerNebraska state Sen. John DeCamp. He called the thought of limitingBush's choices ``the profoundly dumbest'' he'd heard.   It was Sen. Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H., who ignited the issue bysuggesting an ideological test for the vice presidential nominee.Without it, he warned, political conservatives could withhold theirsupport from the GOP ticket.   But dozens of delegates interviewed by The Associated Press onSunday and Monday broadly rejected that suggestion. While manyexpressed their personal favorites, nearly all said they wouldsupport Bush's choice regardless.</TEXT><DATELINE>NEW ORLEANS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It wasn't too long ago that they were a packof bickering rivals, six would-be presidents sniping and squabblingin public over who could best lead the Republicans to victory inNovember.   George Bush was most often the target of the other five, whonever hesitated to list his shortcomings.   But all that is forgotten now, as Bob Dole, Jack Kemp, AlexanderHaig Jr., Pete du Pont and Pat Robertson join the Republicanconvention this week in singing Bush's praises.   While Bush is the undisputed star of the GOP unity fest, theother five are by no means shrinking violets during the week'sactivities.   Two are busily keeping themselves at the front of the vicepresidential sweepstakes; three will be prominently featured inprime-time slots at the convention; and all five are making therounds with delegate speeches, media interviews and receptions intheir honor.   Each of the former candidates was given a spot to address theconvention hall, du Pont and Haig shortly after the opening gavelon Monday morning, and Robertson, Kemp and Dole in the prizedprime-time slots at evening sessions.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Americans had more babies in 1987 than in anyyear in nearly a quarter-century, but at the same time the nationrecorded more deaths than any year in history.   Last year also saw the lowest marriage and divorce rates in overa decade, according to figures compiled by the government'sNational Center for Health Statistics.   A slight increase in fertility, coupled with the huge number ofwomen in their prime childbearing years, resulted in an estimated3,829,000 new arrivals last year, the most since 1964, the centerreported Monday in its preliminary statistical summery for 1987.   Millions of people born in the post-World War II Baby Boom arenow in their 20s and 30s and, after completing school and launchingcareers, have begun families.   That has led to a sharp increase in the total number of birthsin recent years, although the nation's rate of 66.1 births per1,000 women aged 15 to 44 remains at about half that of the late1950s, when the Baby Boom was at its peak.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   U.S. industrial production shot up 0.8 percentin July, the biggest increase in nine months, the government saidMonday in a report which intensified economists' worries aboutrising inflationary pressures.   The Federal Reserve said the large July advance was widespreadthroughout U.S. manufacturing industries and also reflected heavydemand for electricity during the summer heat wave.   The 0.8 percent July advance was double the 0.4 percent Juneincrease and marked the 10th consecutive month that industrialproduction has risen. It was the largest increase since a 1.1percent rise last October.   Many economists had been expecting a strong July increase, giventhe fact the Labor Department already had reported thatmanufacturing employment rose by 68,000 jobs in July, the largestincrease this year.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Reserve, one week after itsdramatic move to boost a key interest rate, is likely to continuepushing rates higher, many economists predicted Monday on the eveof a policy-making meeting.   These analysts believe that the Fed has decided that higherrates are necessary to slow an economy where demand pressures arebumping up against tight labor markets and capacity restraints inthe manufacturing sector.   ``We are facing the danger of a new wage-price inflationaryspiral and I am looking for further tightening steps based on aperception by Fed policy-makers that the economy is growing toostrongly,'' said David Jones, senior economist at Aubrey G. Lanstonandamp; Co., a government securities dealer.   Fed policy-makers will convene behind closed doors on Tuesday toreview the economy's prospects and chart monetary policy for thenext 1{ months.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff islikely to concur with the minor disciplinary recommendationscontained in an investigative report on the shootdown of an Iranianairliner by the USS Vincennes, defense officials said Monday.   The report, in its current form, recommends the light penalty ofa ``non-punitive letter of censure'' for the guided-missilecruiser's operations officer, said the officials, who insisted onanonymity.   That officer, so far not identified, would be reprimanded forhis role in misinterpreting radar data and leading the Vincennes'skipper, Capt. Will C. Rogers, that the ship was about to beattacked by an Iranian fighter.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Soviet Red Army is beating an orderlyretreat from Afghanistan but has left millions of deployed anddangerous mines behind, the State Department said Monday.   Many of the devices are disguised as toys, others are so-called``butterfly'' explosives that cause limited damage. But the overalltotal, which spokesman Charles E. Redman placed at 10 million to 30million, amounts to one to three for every Afghan.   ``These mines are strewn throughout the countryside and so it'sdifficult to come up with a precise figure,'' Redman said at thedepartment's daily news briefing.   He said they were placed there by the Soviet Army and by theAfghan forces engaged in an 8{-year war with U.S.-backed guerrillas.</TEXT><DATELINE>BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rangoon was quiet Monday and Burmesecrowded in front of a hospital to search for names of friends andrelatives on a list of the casualties in last week's violence, aWestern tourist reported.   There were calls for more protest, and Thai officials saidBurmese authorities closed a crossing between Thailand's Ranongprovince and the market town of Victoria Point in Burma'ssouthernmost province of Megui.   Last week, security forces in Victoria Point were said to haveturned against the authoritarian military government and allowedthousands of protesters to march unhindered.</TEXT><TEXT>   NEAR THE HONDURAN-NICARAGUAN BORDER (AP) _ Most Nicaraguanrebels have retreated to bases in the Honduran mountains, alongwith civilian supporters, and their leaders blame the U.S. Congressfor not providing enough supplies.   The exodus began four months ago and leaves no more than 2,000Contras, as the rebels are called, in Nicaragua to fight theleftist Sandinista government, according to rebels in the camps.That's the smallest number since the Contras began their war in1981.   Contra officials said more than 8,000 fighters and up to 5,000civilians were in the tent camps spread over mountain terrain about220 miles east of Tegucigalpa, capital of Honduras.   More than 1,000 fighters and civilians arrived Sunday. Thelargest single group to date, more than 2,500, was said to beapproaching the winding Coco River frontier.</TEXT><DATELINE>TUSCALOOSA, Ala. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The founding chapter of the nation'slargest college fraternity is fighting for its life because of thearrests of four members on cocaine charges.   University of Alabama officials have ordered the fraternity _Sigma Alpha Epsilon _ shut down for two years because of the drugarrests.   Fraternity leaders are hoping for a favorable ruling in anappeal which is expected to be decided this month.

In the last week, the government's election worries have beencompounded by an exchange of accusations with the secret police ofmischief-making and political spying.   The feud between the government and its counterintelligence arm,known as SAPO, goes back decades.   But the tension resurfaced after book publisher and formerjournalist Ebbe Carlsson launched his own investigation into the1986 assassination of Prime Minister Olof Palme.   It became clear the amateur detective, an insider in thegoverning party, was investigating SAPO as much as looking for theelusive killer.</TEXT><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The electromagnetic roar of modern America isthwarting scientists' efforts to monitor the faint whispers of theuniverse, a radio astronomer complained Monday.   With each start of a car, hum of a computer or clatter of anautomatic garage door, another signal is added to the electronicgarbage polluting the airways and obscuring the heavens from radiotelescopes, noted Marcus Price of the University of New Mexico.   ``The radio spectrum is a natural resource and as with anynatural resource, it can get polluted,'' Price said in aninterview. ``It's not like air or water pollution because you can'tsee it, but it's there.''   For that reason, he said, astronomers are anxious thatunneccessary uses of radio signals be eliminated. In many cases,gross radio interference sources could be controlled with the useof filters or shields that would add only a dollar or two tomanufacturing costs, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
