The emerging accord extends the principle of verificationestablished in a 1987 U.S.-Soviet treaty to scrap all nuclearmissiles with a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.   But the United States must first gain the cooperation of WestGermany, on whose territory some U.S. chemical weapons are stored,U.S. officials said Wednesday.   Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Soviet Foreign MinisterEduard A. Shevardnadze would sign the agreement at their Sept. 22-23meeting in Jackson Hole, Wyo., while making preparations for asuperpower summit.   President Bush will see Shevardnadze in Washington on Sept. 21,White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said.   ``The president would want to reassure him on support for thereforms in the Soviet Union and make sure there's nomisunderstanding about our intention to move as fast as we can onarms control,'' Fitzwater said.   He said it was uncertain whether the Baker-Shevardnadze meetingwould produce a date for a summit between Bush and Soviet PresidentMikhail Gorbachev.   U.S. officials, who disclosed the latest arms control moves, saidfinal details first must be ironed out by U.S. and Soviet experts.   They will meet here next Monday and Tuesday and try to determineexactly how much information is to be exchanged under the agreement.   ``We are close,'' one official said.   The other key provision calls for short-notice inspection of eachother's stockpiles and plants. It is designed as a model for aninternational treaty now under negotiation by 40 nations in Geneva.   The major sticking point in completing that accord is that theUnited States believes the Soviet Union has more chemical weaponsthan it is willing to acknowledge.   ``We don't believe the Soviets, but we don't know how to find outhow many more they have,'' an official said. ``It's very difficult.''   But he said the U.S.-Soviet memorandum is designed to serve as a``confidence-building'' measure that could improve prospects for a40-nation treaty.   The two superpowers, the only countries to admit possessingchemical weapons, began their negotiations four years ago and havehad 12 rounds of talks in Geneva.   Besides the imminent accord, they recently agreed on twoprovisions that could be part of the 40-nation treaty, the officialsaid.   One sets the procedures for destroying chemical weapons and theother for conducting inspections at suspect sites.   The two sides would reduce their arsenals to equal levels overeight years, with the aim of eliminating the remaining weapons lateron.   Only this week Shevardnadze accused the Bush administration of``timidity'' and failing to take full advantage of arms controlchannels opened by former President Ronald Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail S. Gorbachev.   Administration spokesmen rejected the allegations and citedBush's proposal in the spring for wholesale reductions in NATO andWarsaw Pact troops and non-nuclear armories in Europe.   Some 20 nations are believed to either possess chemical weaponsor the capability to manufacture them. The danger they might be usedis considered by many analysts to at least equal the threat ofnuclear war.   One of the main worries is that chemical weapons smaller eventhan a pack of cigarettes could be concealed by a terrorist and usedfor political extortion or set off in a violent rampage.   Describing verification of chemical weapons as even moredifficult than keeping track of nuclear arms, an official said``many of these weapons are small and can be produced in a smallroom, but the agreement would help us along'' the path to a treaty.   Also on Baker and Shevardnadze's agenda is preparing forPresident Bush's first summit meeting with Soviet President MikhailS. Gorbachev.   The two superpowers in 1987 signed an unprecedented treaty toeliminate all their intermediate-range nuclear missiles. It featuredthe first-ever program for reciprocal inspection of bases where themissiles are deployed as well as manufacturing plants.   It apparently has worked without a hitch and set the two sides ona path for cooperating on the chemical weapons treaty.</TEXT></DOC>
