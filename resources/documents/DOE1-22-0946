Due to formation of the compound3SrO.Al/sub 2/O/sub 3/, the metal yield is 50-55 per cent. Scaling upthe process will require increase in the dia/height ratio of the reductionretort and the time of reduction. Strontium is purified by vacuum distillationthat gives metal of 97.5 per cent purity. Chemical and X-ray analysisof the slags established the course of aluminothermic reduction process.SrO associated in the slag can be recovered with sodium carbonate treatment.16 refs., 6 tables.</TEXT></DOC>
