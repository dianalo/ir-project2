Hundreds of documents found in the files of the KGB andinterviews with officials, including the 15 charged plotters,have disclosed a scheme to take power from Mr. Gorbachev andturn the country back to the Stalin era, said Yevgeny Lisov,who heads the investigation. The bulk of the work was carriedout by six organizers and Mr. Gorbachev played no rolewhatsoever in supporting them, Mr. Lisov said.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Gorbachev survived the coup attempt, but it soweakened his government that he was out of a job anywaywithin months as the Soviet Union crumbled and was replacedby a commonwealth of 11 former Soviet republics.   The report by Mr. Lisov and Russian prosecutor ValentinStepankov didn't offer many new details about the coup,despite four and a half months of work by a team ofinvestigators. The trials will begin after the defendantshave had a chance to review the volumes of material compiledagainst them and Mr. Lisov indicated he was reluctant to bemore specific about who did what and when, because he didn'twant to prejudice the trial.   Mr. Lisov emphasized that the plot hadn't been spontaneousand the idea of taking power from Mr. Gorbachev had beenbuilding as the country became more democratic. As manyobservers have already surmised, the final &quot;danger signal&quot;that swung the plotters into action was the decision to signa new union treaty among the Soviet republics on Aug. 19. Theplotters began meeting two days before and worked out a coupplan, though not on paper, Mr. Lisov said.   Mr. Lisov said credit for defeating the coup belongs toRussian President Boris Yeltsin and the Russian people whostood outside the republic's parliament in Moscow. While manypeople, including Mr. Gorbachev and President Yeltsin, havebeen interviewed by the investigators, charges were lodgedonly against those who actually planned the coup and notthose who supported it politically, Mr. Stepankov said. Theplotters are charged with conspiring to seize power and couldreceive the death penalty.   The 15 were originally charged with high treason, but Mr.Lisov said their actions didn't fit that charge because itwasn't clear which country they were betraying as the SovietUnion no longer exists. A separate investigation is beingconducted on the disappearance of party funds, Mr. Lisovsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
