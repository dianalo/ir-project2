Speaking in Santa Barbara, Calif., where President Reagan is on vacation, Mr. Fitzwater added that the administration expects to send the package to Congress within the next few months. But administration spokesmen stressed that the White House hasn't made any final decisions on the proposed sale.    Congressional and other sources said that in recent briefings for lawmakers, senior administration officials said the U.S. wants to sell the Saudis 1,600 Maverick air-to-ground missiles, which are valued at about $360 million; as many as 14 F-15 jet fighters to replace damaged or destroyed F-15s; and certain ground equipment, including upgrading for M-60 tanks.    In the congressional briefings, the administration linked the sale to tensions in the Persian Gulf. Administration officials noted, for example, that Saudi F-15s are used to protect Saudi Awacs early-warning radar planes, which, in turn, are assisting the U.S. operation to escort oil tankers in the gulf.    Despite tension in the Persian Gulf, some legislators say Congress will block the administration's arms sale to Saudi Arabia, which was disclosed in yesterday's Washington Post. Critics charge that the White House is trying to use deepening U.S. involvement in the gulf as a lever to push the sale through Congress. Such sales are permitted if Congress doesn't block them within a 50-day period that begins when lawmakers receive informal notification from the administration.    Noting that the administration, in the face of fierce congressional opposition, in June withdrew an earlier proposal to sell the Maverick missiles to the Saudis, Rep. Lawrence Smith (D., Fla.) predicted that Congress wouldn't permit the Saudi sale. &quot;I don't see what has changed all that much. There hasn't been any act or series of acts that you could point to that would change our attitude,&quot; said Rep. Smith, who as a strong supporter of Israel often leads the charge against such arms sales.    Meanwhile, the Navy appears to be preparing for the start of another gulf convoy that involves escorting three tankers. The Guadalcanal, a large assault ship, arrived in the gulf last Friday, the Pentagon said, carrying eight RH-53D Sea Stallion mine-sweeping helicopters that will be used to clear away underwater explosives that have endangered U.S. convoy operations. The Guadalcanal was dispatched to the gulf when mines threatened to disrupt the U.S. plan for protecting 11 Kuwaiti oil tankers under the American flag.    What would be the second U.S.-escorted convoy was moored yesterday off Kuwait's Al Ahmadi terminal. The Pentagon, citing security concerns, has refused to say in advance when such convoys depart. </TEXT></DOC>
