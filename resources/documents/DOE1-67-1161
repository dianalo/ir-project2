The workshop sought to identify broad technicalissues that required further study as a contribution to determining,in a safety context, the long-term integrity and hence service life ofwater reactor pressurized components and their important fittings. Theworkshop identified no specific technical limitations which would ruleout on structural integrity grounds the extension of service lives forpressurized components and associated fittings beyond current expectations.Rather, there are a number of areas in which more understanding and,in particular, better and more realistic property and performance datawill be required for assessment purposes if the necessary confidencein maintaining adequate safety margins is to be obtained. The PrincipalWorking Group will be taking actions on a number of these matters.</TEXT></DOC>
