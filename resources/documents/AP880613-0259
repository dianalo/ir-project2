Deposits on the artery walls contribute to heart attacks, highblood pressure and other circulatory problems. These deposits,known as plaque, are made of fat as well as overgrowth of smoothmuscle cells.   The new research shows that muscle cells taken from plaquesproduce a powerful hormone, platelet-derived growth factor, thatstimulates the muscle cells to grow. If so, arteries may becomeclogged because their cells are both producing this hormone andresponding to it by growing. Why is still unclear.   Platelet-derived growth factor was first isolated fromplatelets, blood cells that help to form clots. However, researchhas shown that other cells can also make this hormone.   The study, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, wasconducted on cells in test tubes. Researchers say cells in the bodymay act differently.</TEXT><HEAD>Mountain Lions Are Surrogate Moms For 10 Wildcat Embryos</HEAD><DATELINE>GAINESVILLE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Experts hope surrogate mothers willhelp save the endangered Florida panther.   The implantation of 10 embryos _ one of them half panther _ intwo Texas mountain lions, marks the second use of in vitrofertilization in cats, says Tom Logan of the state Game andFreshwater Fish Commission. ``The success rate for the procedure inhumans is about 17 percent. Since it's only been done to one othercat, and since that was only a month ago, there's no way of tellingwhat the odds are for our two surrogate mothers.''   Researchers mixed 50 eggs from three Texas mountain lions withsperm from a Florida panther and two mountain lions to get theembryos, which were implanted June 3 by Dr. Melody Roelke at theUniversity of Florida veterinary school.   ``We should be happy if even one embryo is carried to full termand is born,'' said Roelke, of the Florida Panther ReintroductionProject. Pregnancies in the cats are 93 days long.   Mountain lions are used because they are nearly identicalbiologically to panthers and because wildlife laws forbid the useof endangered animals in any experimental program. Experts believeno more than 30 panthers remain.   The first in vitro attempt was last month at the National Zoo,Logan said. That involved a leopard cat, said Roelke.</TEXT><HEAD>Fetal Cell Implants May Help Fight Parkinson's</HEAD><DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Fetal brain tissue implanted in two SwedishParkinson's disease patients appears healthy six months aftersurgery, and a University of Colorado researcher says that maysignal new hope for sufferers of the disease.   The two transplants are believed to be the first monitoredclosely enough to produce scientifically reliable results, said Dr.Barry J. Hoffer, professor of pharmacology at the University ofColorado Health Sciences Center and part of an international teamresponsible for the clinical trials.   Hoffer said it's too soon to tell if the tissue transplantedlate last year will produce noticeable improvement in therecipients, two middle-aged women in advanced stages of theneurological disorder that affects 500,000 Americans.   Parkinson's is a progressive destruction of nerve cells. Victimssuffer tremors and increasing muscle stiffness until they cannotmove normally.   In the experimental therapy, a small cluster of brain tissue isremoved from an aborted fetus and injected into the patient nearthe base of the brain. In animals, the fetal cells develop intonerve cells that produce dopamine, a central nervous systemtransmitter that Parkinson's disease patients lack.   The use of fetal tissue has sparked controversy in anti-abortioncircles.</TEXT><HEAD>Researchers Closing In On Alcoholism Gene</HEAD><DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Researchers say they're on the trail of a genethat could lead to a blood test to identify people vulnerable toalcoholism.   A study of 30 families, each with at least two alcoholic malesiblings, showed a possible link between alcoholism and the MNSblood group, a genetic marker determining blood type, says ShirleyY. Hill of the University of Pittsburgh's Western PsychiatricInstitute andamp; Clinic.   ``Eventually, we may be able to screen people and tell them howgreat their risk is of being an alcoholic,'' Ms. Hill says.   Among members of any one family, the alcoholics' MNS blood grouphad similarities not apparent among the blood group in thenon-alcoholics, she says. ``We don't know what the gene is. Itcould be a gene that affects the way people react to alcohol, theway the brain reacts. It could be a gene that's important indeveloping a compulsive personality.''   Research points to the existence of such a gene, but not itslocation. Studies show that children of alcoholics face four timesthe risk of becoming alcoholics themselves, even when separatedfrom the alcoholic parents at birth and adopted by a non-alcoholicmother and father, Ms. Hill says.   The findings are to be published in the journal Alcoholism:Clinical and Experimental Research.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for June 16</NOTE></DOC>
