Witnesses testifying before the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee portrayed an agency at odds with its own investigators and seeking to gain control over their work. Chairman John Glenn (D., Ohio) said he was &quot;deeply disturbed&quot; by the findings. He called for legislation guaranteeing independence to NRC investigators.    The hearing disclosed that in 1983, executives of Louisiana Power andamp; Light Co., a unit of New Orleans-based Middle South Utilities Inc., obtained a sensitive internal NRC memo citing alleged deficiencies in the utility's Waterford nuclear plant and in its oversight by NRC inspectors.    Ben Hayes, director of the NRC's Office of Investigations, which investigates NRC-licensed utilities, said the leak constituted &quot;tipping a licensee of a potential investigation.&quot; Utility paperwork showed the memo was received within four days of its first distribution within the commission, he said.    Mr. Hayes said the memo's markings make clear that it came from the files of Commissioner Thomas Roberts, one of the NRC's most unwavering supporters of the nuclear industry. Mr. Roberts denied that he leaked the memo, and said he doesn't believe his staff did either.    But Mr. Roberts conceded he demanded that Mr. Hayes turn over all copies of the memo and all notes concerning the incident, and that Mr. Roberts destroyed them. Mr. Hayes said the commission ignored his suggestion that internal investigators probe the source of the leak.    Two NRC witnesses said that NRC employees have little confidence in the agency's internal investigators. And they charged that managers in the agency's Arlington, Texas, regional office harassed and intimidated NRC investigators who aggressively pursued utility mismanagement.    They charged that the commission's most powerful staff member, Executive Director of Operations Victor Stello, interfered with investigations on more than one occasion by talking with the targets of the probes.    The Senate committee was told that in January 1986, Mr. Stello advised Steven White, the Tennessee Valley Authority's manager of nuclear power, not to give a specific answer to an NRC query on whether the TVA's Watts Bar nuclear plant met NRC specifications.    Julian Greenspun, a former Justice Department prosecutor, suggested that Mr. Stello &quot;actively misled us&quot; during a department probe.    The department was looking into reports that that reactor leak-rate tests had been falsified at the Three Mile Island Unit 2 nuclear plant for the six months before the accident there in March 1979. The plant is operated by a unit of General Public Utilities Corp., Parsippany, N.J.    In another instance, Mr. Greenspun charged that Mr. Stello's conversations with an NRC licensee ruined the government's chance to make a criminal case against the licensee. He said grand jury secrecy barred him from discussing the matter in detail.    Mr. Stello, in a brief reply, didn't deny meeting with officials in the case. But he explained that &quot;our regulatory activities don't stop&quot; when a criminal probe is launched. He said he saw nothing wrong with his advice to Mr. White of TVA, and he defended his handling of the Three Mile Island probes.    Mr. Greenspun, who supervised Justice Department investigations of criminal violations by regulated industries from 1979 through 1986, testified angrily: &quot;I know of no other regulatory or investigative agency where senior agency officials have taken as many bizarre and seemingly deliberate actions intended to hamper the investigation and prosecution of individuals and companies in the industry the agency is supposed to regulate.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
