Two boilers of the five unit, coal-fired, 1050 MW Philip Sporn powerplant will be replaced by a 330 MW PFBC unit at an estimated cost of579 million US dollars. The USDOE is expected to decide by October 1988whether to fund to project under the Clean Coal Technology Program. 53other clean coal proposals are competing for funding, sixteen of themsponsored by electric utilities. Clean coal technologies such as PFBCare threatened by proposed acid rain legislation since funds would thenhave to be spent fitting pollution control equipment (scrubbers) to existingpower plants. At present, US utilities run 147 scrubbers with many moreplanned or under construction. Power plant operators also use a varietyof other approaches to comply with the Clean Air Act. The overall costof air pollution control in the US now exceeds 29 billion US dollars/yr,with pollution control equipment accounting for one third of a new coal-firedpower plants cost. Still stricter legislation is proposed. Funds wouldthus be directed away from new technology.</TEXT></DOC>
