The impact, if any, that the decision would have on worldoil supplies wasn't immediately clear, however. AlthoughRussia accounts for 90% of the oil produced in the formerSoviet Union, oil exports already are down by nearlyone-third from last year. And some oil analysts questionedwhether there would be any lasting effects on oil markets,which already have discounted big drops in Soviet exportsthis winter.</LP><TEXT>   But oil supplies and demand are in fragile balanceworld-wide. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesis producing flat out as the peak use period of winter nears.&quot;There is zero spare capacity in the world,&quot; said PaulMlotok, an oil economist with Morgan Stanley andamp; Co.   As a result, oil markets were shaken by Russia'sannouncement Friday that petroleum export licenses are beingsuspended pending review. Cash prices of crude oil jumped byas much as 85 cents a barrel in European markets, which wouldbe affected the most by further drops in oil exports byRussia. Gas oil, or heating oil, rose as much as $8.25 ametric ton on London's International Petroleum Exchange.   Reaction in the U.S. oil market was more subdued, butprices jumped, nevertheless. In futures trading, crude oilfor December delivery settled 27 cents a barrel higher at$22.78. December heating oil surged 1.78 cents a gallon to67.58 cents on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Evengasoline futures rose, with the December contract up 0.93cent a gallon to 64.02 cents.   &quot;It isn't necessarily a {further} cutback in {Soviet} oilexports but could be, and the markets are very nervous,&quot; saidJohn Lichtblau, chairman of the Petroleum Industry ResearchFoundation.   The Russian president, Boris Yeltsin, pledged to takecontrol of all natural resources in his territory, and therepublic issued various decrees to that effect over theweekend. Effective Dec. 1, according to one resolution,exports of petroleum will be limited to make sure therepublic's own fuel requirements are met. It calls for quotasfor crude oil and fuel shipments, including those to otherSoviet republics that are heavily dependent on Russian oil.   By most industry estimates, Soviet oil exports to the Westcurrently are around two million barrels a day, with the bulkof them coming out of Russia. Whether these volumes, alreadyhalf the peak of several years ago, will be further reducedby Russia's latest move remained a question in the oilindustry. But the unpredictability of Russian oil supplies,which had kept a floor under oil prices for much of thisyear, was again underscored.   J. Robinson West, president of Petroleum Finance Co., aWashington-based consulting firm, said Russia's action couldhave a &quot;chilling effect&quot; on foreign capital going into it,particularly from the oil companies. &quot;This is not a situationlikely to give foreign investors a great deal of confidence,if their ability to export oil is essentially in doubt,&quot; hesaid.   Mr. West and others said oil markets could be seriouslyaffected if Russia's moves resulted in significant furthercuts in its oil exports. Some suggested that major pricerun-ups, similar to those during the Persian Gulf crisis,would occur again.   But some oil analysts expressed doubt that the Russianswould take any steps that would affect oil's hard-currencyearnings. &quot;They need foreign currencies as well as heat,&quot;said Shahrokh Nikkhah, executive vice president of Refco Inc.   World oil inventories are ample at the moment. Still,petroleum prices now are likely to remain firm through thewinter, many analysts suggested. Also, the Russiandevelopments support Saudi Arabia's position in OPEC.   The Saudis maintain OPEC should not return to quotasbecause of the possibility of further supply disruptions. Theoil ministers meet Nov. 26 to set their production level forthe first quarter.   Any pressures on oil prices should lift once demand beginsto slacken seasonally after the heavy demand of winter ends,several analysts said. &quot;After the turn of the year, themarket should start to fade again,&quot; said William H. BrownIII, international oil analyst at Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co.</TEXT></DOC>
