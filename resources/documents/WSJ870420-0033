How, the professor asked, could he and other anti-smoking activists put more pressure on tobacco companies?    One suggestion: product-liability suits.    The students would give their teacher an &quot;A&quot; for following the advice.    The class's idea prompted Mr. Daynard to co-found the Tobacco Products Liability Project in late 1984. Working with a shoestring budget of less than $40,000 a year, the group has helped orchestrate a relentless legal barrage at the tobacco industry -- which has increased the number of liability suits to more than 125 currently from about a dozen when the group was started.    And Mr. Daynard, who is chairman of the group, hopes that's only the beginning. The bearded 43-year-old, who occasionally sports an anti-smoking tie (like the Ghostbusters symbol, only with a cigarette), is a leading advocate of using lawsuits as a weapon against the tobacco industry. &quot;Education is a limiting strategy,&quot; he says. &quot;The tobacco industry does $2.7 billion worth of education (through advertising) that says smoking isn't all that bad . . . and legislation isn't enough.&quot;    Anti-smoking forces have yet to win any major legal battles, but Mr. Daynard is undeterred. Indeed, he's crusading for a wave of suits against retailers and tobacco companies for participating in illegal sales of cigarettes to minors. The first such suit, filed recently in Massachusetts by a 17-year-old girl, charges that she has suffered lung damage and nicotine addiction because a store chain has sold cigarettes to her since she was 12.    Winning the suit, Mr. Daynard says, could be a major blow to tobacco companies because most smokers start before age 21. &quot;Their whole strategy depends on getting new users,&quot; he adds.    Next, Mr. Daynard hopes, will come suits charging tobacco company executives with criminal liability for deaths and diseases caused by smoking. Likening them to &quot;mini-Adolf Eichmanns,&quot; he contends, &quot;they are taking actions that contribute to 350,000 deaths a year. . . . This is homicide on a very broad scale.&quot;    The tobacco industry is, understandably, upset by such harsh words. &quot;It sounds to me like it's slanderous,&quot; says Thomas Ricke, a spokesman for Philip Morris Cos., the giant New York-based cigarette and beverage holding company. As for the Liability Project's legal strategy, &quot;I can't think of a darn thing I'd care to say,&quot; says Walker Merryman, vice president of the Tobacco Institute, an industry lobbying group. But in 1986, the lobbying group says, an estimated 584 billion cigarettes were consumed in the U.S.    Although an advocate of nonsmokers, Mr. Daynard insists he isn't a zealot. A sign outside one of his offices at Northeastern politely asks, &quot;Please don't smoke.&quot; In public, he says, &quot;I'm not the perfect role model who tells people to stop smoking. There's a high chance of things becoming unpleasant.&quot;    He confesses to having smoked five cigarettes during his youth (so as &quot;not to be a prude&quot;). As he recalls, he hated it. &quot;I coughed a lot and turned green&quot;.    Before starting the Liability Project, Mr. Daynard served as president of the Massachusetts Group Against Smoking Pollutions, or GASP, as the group is called. At its urging, Newton, Mass., became the first eastern city to limit smoking in the work place. &quot;Having done that, I thought, do we do this for the next 350 towns and cities in Massachusetts? That wasn't my style. It was too slow,&quot; Mr. Daynard says.    That's when he helped start the Liability Project. The group itself doesn't file product-liability suits. But it played a major role in the increase in the number of such suits by bringing together attorneys and referring potential plaintiffs.    &quot;Dick's group has been a motivating force. . . . It has acted as a vehicle to provide lawyers not involved in litigation with materials to play catch-up and make easier their task,&quot; says Marc Edell, a Morristown, N.J., attorney who was one of the few who brought such cases before the group was organized.    A keen sense for generating attention has helped the group's cause. To publicize the 17-year-old girl's lawsuit charging illegal sales of cigarettes to minors, the group held a news conference featuring Bob Keeshan (a.k.a. Captain Kangaroo). &quot;It was a way of getting people to come,&quot; Mr. Daynard notes. GASP is financing the suit.    After Philip Morris sponsored an essay contest last year on commercial free speech and cigarette advertising, the Liability Project countered this year with an essay contest for law students. The topic: criminal liability of tobacco executives. The idea, Mr. Daynard says, is to get a new generation of lawyers interested in filing suits against tobacco companies.    So far, anti-smoking forces have had little luck in court. Judges generally have ruled that the warning printed on cigarette packages is adequate to protect the industry from claims that it has failed to caution smokers that cigarettes are dangerous.    But Mr. Daynard believes plaintiffs eventually will win cases as anti-smoking attitudes become more common. &quot;The judicial system doesn't exist in a vacuum. . . . Judges are products of their times, as are juries,&quot; he notes. </TEXT></DOC>
