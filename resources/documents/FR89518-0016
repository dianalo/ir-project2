The airway realignment enhances safety by providing bypassroutes in the Charlotte, NC, and Greensboro areas, thereby avoiding themix of en route and terminal traffic. This action improves traffic flowand reduces delays and controller workload. Interested parties were invitedto participate in this rulemaking proceeding by submitting written commentson the proposal to the FAA. No comments objecting to the proposal werereceived. Except for editorial changes, this amendment is the same as thatproposed in the notice. Section 71.123 of Part 71 of the Federal AviationRegulations was republished in Handbook 7400.6E dated January 3, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule</ITAG>This amendment to Part 71 of the Federal Aviation Regulations alters thedescriptions of VOR Federal Airways V-20, V-266, and V-409 located in thevicinity of Greensboro, NC. The airway realignment enhances safety by providingbypass routes in the Charlotte, NC, and Greensboro areas, thereby avoidingthe mix of en route and terminal traffic. This action improves trafficflow and reduces delays and controller workload.The FAA has determined that this regulation only involves an establishedbody of technical regulations for which frequent and routine amendmentsare necessary to keep them operationally current. It, therefore_(1) Isnot a ``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; (2) is not a ``significantrule'' under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February26, 1979); and (3) does not warrant preparation of a regulatory evaluationas the anticipated impact is so minimal. Since this is a routine matterthat will only affect air traffic procedures and air navigation, it iscertified that this rule will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 71</ITAG>Aviation safety, VOR Federal airways. <ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, Part 71 of theFederal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR Part 71) is amended, as follows: <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 71_DESIGNATION OF FEDERAL AIRWAYS, AREA LOW ROUTES, CONTROLLEDAIRSPACE, AND REPORTING POINTS </ITAG>1.
