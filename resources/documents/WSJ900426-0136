The bill is the administration's response to aninvestigation of the generic drug industry by a congressionalsubcommittee headed by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.). Theinvestigation revealed alleged industry fraud against theFood and Drug Administration and bribery of FDA officials,and resulted in several criminal convictions of drug-companyexecutives and FDA officials.</LP><TEXT>   Rep. Henry Waxman (D., Calif.), who heads a Housesubcommittee that will consider the bill, said it &quot;appears tooffer a constructive approach in giving the FDA new and muchneeded enforcement tools.&quot; William Haddad, chairman of theGeneric Pharmaceutical Industry Association, a trade group,said he took a &quot;generally favorable&quot; view of the proposedlegislation.   Under the administration plan, which would apply to bothgeneric and brand-name drug companies, individuals whodefraud the FDA would be subject to fines of as much as$100,000 for each incident. They also would be barred fromapplying for approval on new drug products for at least threeyears. Currently, the FDA lacks the legal authority to barsuch individuals from the drug-approval process.   Drug companies that have been found guilty of defraudingthe FDA could be fined as much as $5 million for eachincident. The companies would be barred from marketing in theU.S. for a period of two years any drugs approved while thecriminal activity occurred. This provision could be overruledby HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan.   Rep. Dingell also plans to introduce a bill that wouldinclude more mandatory penalties and would apply only togeneric drug companies, according to a congressional source.The bill also would propose that the FDA inspector general'soffice investigate wrongdoing in the generic drug industry.Currently, the inspector general is permitted to investigatecorruption only in the government.   Rep. Dingell said the administration proposal was&quot;well-intentioned, but we're going to continue working on ourown legislation.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
