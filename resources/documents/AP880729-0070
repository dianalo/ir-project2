Barco's decision Thursday dashed hopes for a quick settlement toa guerrilla war that killed 75,000 people in 25 years. Barco actedafter military leaders criticized the proposed talks.   But Barco, in a communique, said his government planned to studyrecommendations by the conference. The meeting was to includechurch leaders, former presidents, 20 congressmen and a formerpresidential candidate who was kidnapped and later freed by theguerrillas.   The leader of the April 19 Movement, Carlos Pizarro Leongomez,planned to send a tape-recorded message to the gathering, a Pizarrospokesman, Carlos Ramiro Lucio Escobar, said at a news conferenceThursday.   The spokesman said the government decision not to participatecould be a mistake. An estimated 10,000 to 20,000 guerrillasoperate in Colombia.   The guerrilla group, also known as M-19, demanded peace talks asa condition for the release earlier this month of the formerpresidential candidate it kidnapped.   The government refused to meet the demand for the release ofAlvaro Gomez Hurtado, who was abducted May 29 in a hail ofsubmachine-gun fire in Bogota.   The guerrilla group released Gomez anyway and the governmentsaid it would think about negotating with the insurgents.   Church leaders and members of the country's two leadingpolitical groups, the Conservative and Liberal parties, met inPanama with M-19 guerrillas to win Gomez's release.   Those who met with the guerrillas said that regardless of thegovernment's decision they would organize a peace conference inBogota after Gomez was freed. Gomez, the son of former PresidentLaureano Gomez, said he would attend.   The M-19 also took over the Palace of Justice Nov. 7, 1985 in anattack that left 115 dead, including 11 Supreme Court justices.   Bishop Dario Castrillon Hoyos has been the driving force behindorganizing the peace conference.   After meeting Thursday with Barco at the presidential palace, herevealed the government's refusal to attend the peace conferenceand said he could understand the difficult position Barco is in.   Castrillon did not elaborate, but he undoubtedly was referringto the military's opposition to peace talks. ``The nation wants tostop the war,'' the bishop said. ``It has to be stopped.''   The country's two most powerful generals, the minister ofdefense, Rafael Samudio, and the head of the chiefs of staff, JaimeGuerrero, have said they oppose any peace talks with the rebels.   But the two generals, in an apparent attempt to calm fears of amilitary coup attempt, also said they would abide by any governmentdecision to negotiate with the insurgents.   Barco's communique said his government might offer pardons toguerrillas for political crimes. But even that position left littlehope of any reconciliation between the government and theguerrillas.   Political crimes, by the government's definition, do not includethe majority of guerrilla activities _ kidnappings, ambushes onarmy patrols and bloody raids on dozens of towns in the last 25years.</TEXT></DOC>
