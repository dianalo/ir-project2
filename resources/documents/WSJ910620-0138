The British Treasury's confirmation that a G-7 meetingwill be convened Sunday in London sent traders scrambling forprotection amid uncertainty over how the G-7 will react tothe dollar's recent surge. German and Japanese monetaryauthorities have escalated their rhetoric at each step of thedollar's climb against the mark and yen, while officials ofother G-7 countries either have been neutral or silent.</LP><TEXT>   Traders said they're preparing for the worst-casescenerio: that the finance ministers and central bankers ofthe U.S., France, Canada, Italy and the U.K. will go alongwith their German and Japanese counterparts in deciding todrive the dollar down. But they hastened to add that if theG-7 failed to issue a clear statement of its intentions onexchange rates, the dollar will quickly resume its rise.   In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.7904marks, down from 1.8167 marks late Tuesday in New York. TheU.S. currency was changing hands at 140.08 yen, down from141.10 yen. Sterling was trading at $1.6355, up from $1.6097.   In Tokyo early Thursday, the dollar was trading at 139.95yen, down from Wednesday's Tokyo close of 141.10 yen.Meanwhile, the U.S. currency was trading at 1.7896 marks,down from 1.8174 marks at Tokyo's close Wednesday.   &quot;I think the market is being prudent right now by paringoff short mark and short {non-U.S.} currency positions&quot; aheadof the G-7 meeting, said Albert Soria, first vice presidentand foreign exchange manager at Kansallis Osake Pankki in NewYork. To be short a currency means, in effect, to bet thatthe currency will fall.   Aggravating the dollar sales was a report fromWashington-based consultants Johnson Smick InternationalInc., which told clients to &quot;basically protect yourself,particularly if you are long dollars&quot; ahead of the G-7meeting, said a person familiar with the report, which wasn'twidely available. Johnson Smick, which declined comment, isinfluential in the markets because former Federal ReserveVice Chairman Manuel Johnson is a principal in the concern.   Mr. Soria said that if the G-7 issues a statement that is&quot;anything short of a concrete agreement of a cap {for thedollar}, it's going to create some serious dollar buying&quot;next week. The dollar may then have &quot;a clear-cut path to1.8500 {marks} to 1.9000&quot; marks, Mr. Soria said.   Joanne Peterson, a vice president at Bank of America inLos Angeles, also said she expects the dollar &quot;to fly higher&quot;if there is no statement on the currency. &quot;The market hasbeen very careful in taking the dollar up because they areafraid of G-7 intervention,&quot; she added.   Dealers also reported rumors that Germany may be planningto raise its interest rates. In a regular monthly report, theDeutsche Bundesbank said inflationary pressures in westernGermany have worsened. &quot;In light of the soured priceperspectives, monetary policy must do everything in its powerto preserve currency stability,&quot; the June report concluded.At the same time, the report said western Germany's economicgrowth appears to have peaked.   Because of the G-7 jitters, and disappointment when theU.S. Commerce Department said the April trade deficit was awider-than-expected $4.78 billion, dealers looked for theexits. The U.S. currency stopped falling during NorthAmerican trading at 1.7865 marks, but some participants saidit could fall to 1.7500 marks before the week ends.   Corporate demand was sparse despite the fact that thedollar's intraday low was a full 2% below the intraday peak,a 19month high, of 1.8230 marks. Dealers in Asia, ignoringreports of the G-7 gathering, rushed into the dollar ahead ofthe release of the U.S. trade data. The last time the dollartraded so high was Nov. 21, 1989, when it hit 1.8385 marks.   &quot;My feeling is there was anticipation of an exceptionallygood trade number&quot; and the overseas markets were &quot;aggressivebuying&quot; dollars ahead of the data's release, said DavidJaques, a senior corporate trader at Barclays Bank in NewYork.   Mr. Soria said that without the G-7 news, the dollar wouldhave moved &quot;marginally higher&quot; yesterday. He added that theU.S. Federal Reserve's &quot;Beige Book&quot; report showed that therecession is bottoming out. The Fed's policy-making FederalOpen Market Committee will use the report at its July 2-3meeting to help determine whether changes are necessary inU.S. monetary policy.   When the trade data were released, the market solddollars. Bill Bertha, vice president and manager of foreignexchange at Mellon Bank in Pittsburgh, said the market was&quot;astonishingly&quot; long on dollars going into yesterday and&quot;something was going to correct it at some point.&quot; To be longon a currency means to bet that it will rise.   On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for currentdelivery settled at $368.60 an ounce, up 30 cents. Estimatedvolume was a light two million ounces.   In Hong Kong early Thursday, gold was trading at $368.30an ounce.</TEXT></DOC>
