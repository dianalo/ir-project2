The severity of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's defeat in Sunday's upperhouse parliamentary election and the resignation of Prime Minister Sosuke Uno have created a level of uncertainty unknown since the LDP took power 34 years ago.    Will the LDP be able to retain control of the government, or will the opposition parties unite and claim leadership? Will the LDP reform itself without changing its basic structure, or will it splinter? Will politicians abandon the traditional back-room maneuvering that has ignited public anger, or will the public slip back into apathetic acceptance of business-as-usual?    Both the battered ruling party and the resurgent opposition already have set out to shape the answers to those questions. LDP leaders held emergency meetings to start deciding who will replace Mr. Uno, who held the premiership for only two months. And the opposition -- led by the Japan Socialist Party, which won more of the seats contested Sunday than any other party -- aimed at forcing early elections for the more-powerful lower house of parliament. The LDP lost its majority in the upper house Sunday but still holds a majority in the lower house.    But both sides will encounter potential pitfalls. For the LDP, the way in which it selects a replacement for Mr. Uno may prove crucial to improving the party's image: If the leaders of various LDP factions select the next party president and de facto prime minister through their usual behind-the-scenes deal-making, it will only aggravate the party's image of arrogant disregard for the public. Within hours of Mr. Uno's resignation announcement, party elders and concerned junior members were calling for an open election in the name of democracy.    The list of candidates looks painfully familiar. It includes former Prime Minister Takeo Fukuda; former chief cabinet secretary Masaharu Gotoda; the LDP's &quot;Mr. Clean,&quot; Masayoshi Ito; the current party secretary general, Ryutaro Hashimoto; and faction leader Toshio Komoto. Many of them were approached by party leaders before Mr. Uno accepted the job. They rejected the offer then, or were passed over, and the outlook is similarly bleak today.    Meanwhile, most political analysts expect the opposition to succeed in forcing elections for the lower house before year end, thereby denying the LDP more time to recoup some of its lost popularity. The opposition parties plan to make good on a key campaign pledge by jointly introducing a bill to abolish the wildly unpopular consumption tax sponsored by the LDP and imposed in April. That kind of bill is sure to entangle the lower house in endless wrangling, building immense pressure for an election.    If the opposition succeeds with this ploy, however, it will face much deeper challenges. The four non-Communist opposition parties agree on several short-term issues but are bitterly opposed in their underlying policies. The Socialists, strained between hardline and moderate elements, would have to move toward the middle of the road to win the cooperation of the centrist Democratic Socialist Party and Komeito (Clean Government Party).    The power the opposition might be able to command if it can unify was demonstrated Sunday by the startling success of a new party -- Rengo, an organization created by the main labor organization and backed by all four opposition parties. In direct battles against incumbent LDP politicians in the ruling party's traditional rural strongholds, Rengo captured 11 of the 12 seats it sought.    Rengo members plan to encourage a coalition. And the Socialists proved Sunday to have broadened their base beyond the solid support of unions, a growth that should give them more flexibility. Thanks largely to the charisma and drive of Takako Doi, the only woman to lead a political party, the Socialists galvanized support from citizens' action groups. Even some of the business mainstream, while worried about the LDP's fate, now thinks it would be worthwhile to make friends with the Socialists. Eishiro Saito, the head of Japan's largest business organization, Keidanren, said his organization would like to engage in policy dialogue with the opposition.    But the LDP will provide a stiff challenge to Socialist attempts to form a coalition. The ruling party will woo the centrist parties, whose policies are largely in tune with the LDP's, enticing them with a virtually guaranteed access to power.    The centrist parties -- the Democratic Socialists and Komeito -- probably won't side with the LDP before a lower-house election, because it would lose them votes, party members and political analysts say. Afterwards, however, most analysts expect them to eagerly climb aboard.    The Socialists also are hampered by what has long seemed to be an innate lack of will to take power. And it isn't certain that the sudden political awakening of voters that led to Sunday's reversal of fortunes is sustainable.    Polls suggest people want more balance in government; much of the opposition support came from anti-LDP, not pro-opposition, votes. But Japan's population is intrinsically cautious and polls also show an overwhelming preference for an LDP-led coalition government.    &quot;People are consoled by the fact that they consider the LDP won't be so easily toppled,&quot; said Nobuo Tomita, a professor of politics at Meiji University. &quot;People consider the LDP needs a good spanking.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
