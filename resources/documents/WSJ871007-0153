But the vagueness of Japanese law in defining such trading has been blamed for a lack of prosecution of suspected insider-trading cases.    The ministry's announcement was prompted by an Osaka Stock Exchange investigation that found what it called suspicious buying and selling of Tateho Chemical Industries Co. shares. The chemical company reported losses totaling 28 billion yen ($191.6 million) in Japanese government bond futures trading Sept. 2.
