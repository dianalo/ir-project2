Under an accord signed last year in Geneva, all Soviet troops aredue to be out of Afghanistan by Feb. 15. Vorontsov's remarksindicated the Kremlin wanted the pullout completed ahead of thedeadline.   The radio said Vorontsov would discuss with Iranian officials andAfghan resistance leaders the future of Afghanistan after the RedArmy's evacuation.

It is necessarythat its neighbors exchange views on the future of Afghanistan.''   ``But of course the future of Afghanistan concerns only theAfghan people,'' he stressed.
