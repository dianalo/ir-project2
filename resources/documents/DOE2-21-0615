Autophosphorylation of concentrated {alpha}{beta}receptor halves can be stimulated by insulin an average of 4.0-fold,whereas nonreduced holoreceptor can be stimulated 5.4-fold. If {alpha}{beta}half-receptors are immobilized on wheat germ agglutinin-agarose, no insulin-stimulatedautophosphorylation is observed, whereas immobilized holoreceptor retainsinsulin responsiveness. Treatment of {alpha}{beta} half-receptors withglutathione in the presence of insulin results in reoxidation to theholoreceptor form ({alpha}{sub 2}{beta}{sub 2}) with an efficiency of60-70% as visualized by immunoblotting, thus providing evidence thattwo {alpha}{beta} halves are in close physical proximity. This reoxidationreaction, which is evident prior to autophosphorylation, is rapid andstrictly dependent on the presence of insulin, consistent with the hypothesisthat insulin promotes the association of two {alpha}{beta} halves. Furthermore,the insulin-induced reoxidation reaction and the insulin-induced autophosphorylationshow the same dose dependence suggesting that the noncovalent associationof {alpha}{beta} half-receptors upon insulin binding is a prerequisitefor insulin-stimulated autophosphorylation in concentrated {gamma}{beta}half-receptor preparations. If the {alpha}{beta} half-receptor formsare phosphorylated in the presence of an anti-phosphotyrosine antibodyand separated from nonphosphorylated {alpha}{beta} receptors, we observethat the phosphorylated {alpha}{beta} receptor halves contain bound insulin.</TEXT></DOC>
