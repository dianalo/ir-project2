Baker III said Tuesday.   Baker said he hoped the disagreement could be settled beforeMonday's opening of a 16-member NATO summit in Brussels but saidthere's no assurance that will happen.   He said the ``stumbling block'' was how to draft a compromiseplan that would take into account the new mood in Western Europefor greater disarmament while preserving an ``adequate deterrence.''   ``The alliance has survived many greater threats to itsexistence than this and we remain ... quite hopeful that we'll gethis resolved and that we'll get it resolved before the summit,''Baker said. ``We may not get it resolved before the summit.''   At a news conference at the White House, Baker also announcedJune 19 as the date for resuming U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reducelong-range nuclear weapons.   The talks were suspended last November with about 90 percent ofthe work completed on a treaty to curb strategic missiles, bombersand nuclear submarines.   Rep. Les Aspin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee,said he was pleased with the return to negotiations but expressedconcerns about unresolved problems. He mentioned the debate overStar Wars and the absence of a consensus in Congress and even theBush administration over modernization of land-based nuclearmissiles.   The Wisconsin Democrat said Bush still is ``on trial'' withconservatives and it will be difficult for him to make a deal onSTART.   The dispute in NATO was triggered by West German demands forEast-West negotiations to begin soon to reduce nuclear missileswith a range of less than 300 miles.   The United States and Britain opposed such talks on grounds theWest needs nuclear weapons in Europe to offset a big advantage inground forces, tanks and other conventional forces by theSoviet-led Warsaw Pact nations.   Last week, the United States agreed to accept the principle ofeventual negotiations but only under stringent conditions.   Baker said it would have to be made clear that ``if there wereever to be negotiations in this area, we would not be talking aboutin any event about a third zero'' _ arms control jargon forcomplete elimination of the missiles.   He said that nuclear deterrence has been the cornerstone ofNATO's ``flexible response'' strategy under which military threatsto the West would be countered by a range of options, from tanksand combat troops to nuclear weapons.   ``The flexible response strategy has kept the peace for 40years,'' Baker said. ``We should be very, very reluctant to takeany steps that would be seen to be moving away from that.''   For days, Bonn and Washington have been trading proposals andcounterproposals to produce a compromise. The latest offer fromBonn was received Monday night.   Baker said it did not go far enough.   ``It is not resolved. There is still a gap to bridge. And we'llcontinue to work to try to bridge that gap,'' he said.   Trying to play down the discord, Baker said, ``I just don'tthink that it will totally dominate the summit.'' On the otherhand, he said, ``It will be a very, very important issue.''   A major dispute centers on the timing of any talks onshort-range weapons. While Bonn wants talks to begin soon, theUnited States is insisting on a formula that would put offnegotiations for years, according to an administration official whospoke only on condition of anonymity.   The official said the United States wants the negotiations to bedelayed pending an East-West agreement to reduce the levels ofconventional forces, where the West says the East has a largeadvantage.   Explaining why it would be years before talks could begin onshort-range nuclear missiles, the official said, ``It takes thatlong to negotiate an agreement (on conventional forces) andactually pull out troops and tanks.''</TEXT></DOC>
