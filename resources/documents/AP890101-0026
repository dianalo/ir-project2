(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two men investigating a house burglary ontheir own used a gun to deliver a teen-age ``suspect'' to police,but it was the two men who ended up charged in the incident, policesaid Sunday.   ``You can't be your own vigilante,'' said Police Lt. JamesGabriel.   Allen Lane Calvey, 57, and Nikita J. Vambaketes, 36, were chargedby the Madison County state's attorney with aggravated unlawfulrestraint, a felony, following the incident Wednesday, said policein this southern Illinois city.   Calvey, whose home was burglarized in late November, also wascharged with compelling a confession by force or threat, anotherfelony, Gabriel said.   Police said Calvey had apparently been investigating the burglaryon his own when he and Vambaketes went Wednesday to the home of18-year-old Dennis L. Teague.   Calvey brandished a gun in the confrontation, and forced Teagueto go to the Alton police station, Gabriel said. Calvey took Teagueinside while Vambaketes, who then took the gun, stayed in the car,according to Gabriel.   Gabriel said police had no evidence that Teague was involved inthe burglary, so he was not charged in the incident. But Teague wasarrested on a warrant for a past misdemeanor charge of failure toappear in court on a retail theft charge, police said.   Calvey was freed on a $25,000 bond soon after his arrest, policesaid. Vambaketes remained in the Madison County Jail in lieu of$13,000 bond Sunday awaiting a court appearance, said a jailemployee who did not give his name.   The teen-ager, meanwhile, pleaded guilty Thursday to failure toappear in court, and was released after being ordered to pay a $100fine and court costs, Gabriel said.   Gabriel said he was not sure if anything was taken in theburglary of Calvey's home.   Lt. Robert Lahlein, chief of detectives, said the two menexceeded their authority.   ``Illinois statute gives certain arrest powers to citizens, butnot under these circumstances,'' he said. ``That's why we havepolice.''</TEXT></DOC>
