But asSouth Africa moves further into uncharted political waters,many skilled South Africans are leaving. And their exodus ishelping Stephan Botes build a thriving computer-consultingbusiness in New Jersey.   Mr. Botes, the great great grandson of South Africanstatesman Paul Kruger, came to the U.S. a decade ago armedwith a suitcase, $600 in cash and a $22,000 one-year contractas systems analyst for a software project in Pennsylvania.</LP><TEXT>   Today, he runs a fast-growing computer business with atechnical staff that is 90% imported. As he found, one way tosolve staffing problems is to tap the world, not just theU.S.   Mr. Botes built his company by capitalizing on politicalinstability in his homeland and on the America-or-bustmentality that still prevails among millions in othercountries. He also benefited from the rapid proliferation ofadvanced computer skills throughout the world, creating avast talent pool for U.S. companies.   While many American companies have long filled specializedposts with foreigners, few have gone as far as Mr. Botes inskimming the cream of the immigrants and making them a coreof his business.   Early on, he spotted a business opportunity in the hugeU.S. software market. He identified a successful foreigntechnology beginning to make inroads in the U.S., and thenimported software specialists familiar with it to work onprojects here.   Mr. Botes sold his home and belongings in 1986 to acquirea moribund, four-year-old Montvale, N.J., company calledComputer Consulting Services Corp. Then he began recruitingsoftware engineers in other English-speaking countries,primarily South Africa, who were versed in a database calledAdabas, produced by Germany's Software AG. He says Adabasefficiently handles large volumes of data.   Since then, he says, CCS has grown from a cramped,127-square-foot office with eight employees and first-yearrevenue of $277,000, to 5,000 square feet of space with 55employees and $5.1 million in revenue last year. Of thecompany's 47 computer consultants, 60% come from South Africaand 30% from Britain, Australia and the Philippines. Only 10%are native Americans.   Why South Africa? First, Adabas technology has taken deephold there, and many analysts and programmers know how to useit. Second, Mr. Botes says, the political changes sweepinghis homeland are fueling a flight of professionals andskilled workers. Fearful of the future and disquieted byunending violence, they are looking for opportunities abroad.   &quot;The easiest sell is in South Africa -- everybody wants tocome to the States,&quot; he says. &quot;We were inundated withapplications when {last week's} referendum was announced&quot; onwhether President F.W. de Klerck should continue talks to endminority rule. Mr. Botes adds that for every opening, hiscompany interviews 30 to 40 South Africans. Though gettingvisas can be tricky, the company is able to get them in mostcases, he says. And by paying prevailing U.S. wages, he says,it is in a good position to get exceptional talent.   Employee Neville Saunders acknowledges that nervousnessabout South Africa's future prompted him to take the plunge.The 31-year-old computer consultant, now working on a projectin Hartford, Conn., says he began planning his departurethree years ago, selling his house and building up hissavings. Worsening street crime and the birth of a daughtermade him all the more determined, and he took a job with CCSin January 1991. &quot;I fully agree with the changes happening&quot;in South Africa, Mr. Saunders says. But he predicts a&quot;violent struggle for power&quot; that could devastate thecountry. He is seeking permanent-resident status here.   David Jackson, another South African working for CCS, sayshe is here for the adventure and plans to return to SouthAfrica eventually. But, he adds, &quot;Maybe now's a good time tobe traveling.&quot;   Other U.S. computer concerns are also enlisting foreigntalent. Favorite recruiting grounds for U.S. companiesinclude India, Taiwan and the Soviet Union.   John McIlwain, president of fledgling Software ServicesInternational in New York, notes that India graduates morethan 400,000 engineers a year, a higher number than any otherEnglish-speaking country. While many computer specialistsleave India for the U.S., he says, he taps that high-talent,low-wage market by exporting software work there.   He thinks he has found the right formula: For every U.S.software consultant serving U.S. clients, there are three&quot;programmers in India who work at low cost.&quot;   But a company like CCS -- owned and staffed primarily bynatives of a foreign country and specializing in a technologywith a limited installation base -- is unusual, Mr. McIlwainsays. He says CCS's structure certainly avoids his maindisadvantage, the difficultiy of communicating to a foreignwork force thousands of miles away &quot;exactly what needs to bedone.&quot;   But doing business in America has been far from smoothsailing for CCS. The bureaucrats in Washington have thrown acouple of curves. For example, filing requirements under the1990 immigration law took effect Oct. 1, but the formsweren't available until January, Mr. Botes says. As a result,CCS had to delay putting some new consultants to work andlost several hundred thousand dollars in business. Anothertime, several years ago, a hastily passed federal lawreclassified much of CCS's staff as employees instead ofindependent contractors. &quot;That completely stripped ourprofits for a year and a half,&quot; Mr. Botes says.   With those setbacks behind him, Mr. Botes is lookingforward to continuing strong growth. He says he hopes tonearly double his staff this year. While he warns SouthAfrican job candidates that they will have to sacrifice aluxurious life style of big houses, expensive cars andservants for a while, he touts America to them as theultimate land of opportunity. &quot;We tell them to take two stepsbackward so they can take 10 steps forward,&quot; he says.</TEXT></DOC>
