Restriction enzyme and Southern blot analyses witha murine reductase cDNA probe indicate that the highly resistant isolatescontain amplifications of the dihydrofolate reductase gene number. Dependingupon the parental line used to select these resistant cells, they overproduceeither a wild-type enzyme or a structurally altered enzyme. Karyotypeanalysis shows that some of these isolates contain chromosomes with homogeneouslystaining regions whereas others do not contain such chromosomes.</TEXT></DOC>
