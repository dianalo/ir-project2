Garcia</HL><DD> 04/14/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Stock prices collapsed in the final hour of trading yesterday on rising fears of higher interest rates and a weak dollar.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged nearly 45 points in the last hour, closing down 51.71 at 2287.07. It was the fourth-largest point decline in the history of the industrial average.    The final-hour sell-off was accelerated by a variety of sell programs tied to stock-index futures. The programs were triggered by a slide in the bond market. Treasury bonds maturing in 30 years fell about a point in the last hour and were off 1 3/4 points from Friday's close.    Stock prices showed only small losses and were rather stable until the final-hour rout. Yet, declining issues had a 3-to-1 lead over gainers on the New York Stock Exchange for much of the day, indicating there was more weakness in the market than was registered by the major market barometers.    A gain in International Business Machines had helped offset some of the weakness in the industial average caused by Texaco, which filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy-law protection, citing the burden of its $10.3 billion legal battle with Pennzoil. IBM reported better-than-expected first-quarter earnings.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.87 to 285.62, and the Big Board's composite index dropped 3.58 to 162.14.    Volume on the Big Board rose to 181 million shares from 169.5 million Friday.    John Connolly, a portfolio strategist at Dean Witter Reynolds in New York, believes that yesterday's rapid decline in stock prices was a reaction to the declines in bond prices and the accompanying rise in interest rates that have already taken place over the past 2 1/2 weeks.    Jon Groveman, head of equity trading at Ladenburg Thalmann in New York, said the stock market was able to shrug off a lot of bearish news in recent months, such as the Democrats regaining control of Congress, the widening insider trading scandal and the Iran-Contra affair. But he believes higher rates present a greater problem for investors by throwing into question current stock values.    Today's report on the U.S. merchandise trade deficit for February will be a key one for the stock and bond markets, traders said. Many economists expect that the trade deficit narrowed somewhat in February. If there's no meaningful improvement, economists and traders believe the dollar could decline further and the Federal Reserve might be compelled to tighten its monetary policy to support the dollar.    The good news for some stock investors was that IBM earned $1.30 a share in the first quarter. Although lower than the $1.65 a share IBM earned a year earlier, the results were better than many Wall Street analysts had anticipated. Most were expecting IBM to report earnings of between $1 and $1.20 a share.    First Boston's Steven Milunovich said strong growth in revenue in March pushed up the quarterly results for IBM. He raised his recommendation on the stock to a &quot;buy&quot; from a &quot;hold&quot; and raised his 1987 earnings projection for the company. Several other analysts also raised their opinion on the stock.    IBM closed up 2 5/8 at 147 5/8 on heavy volume after trading as high as 150 1/8. Following IBM, some technology stocks posted early gains, but they were wiped out in the final hour sell-off.    NCR rose 1/4 to 65 1/2. The company reported higher first-quarter earnings, citing strong U.S. orders and the decline in the dollar. NCR added that it expects record revenue and earnings growth for all of 1987.    Texaco's bankruptcy-law filing turned out to be worse news for holders of Pennzoil stock, which plummeted 15 1/4 to 77 on trading of more than 1.4 million shares. The stock had been carrying a hefty premium above its appraised value because investors were assuming that Texaco would have to pay Pennzoil between $3 billion and $5 billion to settle their legal dispute. The bankruptcy filing puts Pennzoil in a less-favorable position to collect damages from Texaco.    Texaco fell 3 3/8 to 28 1/2 on more than 12.6 million shares, making it the Big Board's most active issue. Many portfolio managers were forced to sell the stock because it won't be paying a dividend while the company is undergoing reorganization.    Although Texaco's future may seem bleak now that it has filed for Chapter 11 protection, some Wall Street analysts were recommending the stock.    Interest-rate sensitive stocks such as banks, thrifts and utilities were weak. But insurance issues were the hardest hit. First Boston reportedly cut its opinion on most insurance issues, citing a brewing price war in the commercial insurance business.    Among insurance stocks, Aetna fell 3 to 58 7/8, Chubb declined 4 1/2 to 55 1/2, Fireman's Fund dropped 1 3/8 to 35 3/4, Continental Corp. lost 2 7/8 to 44, Cigna slid 1 3/8 to 61 and Travelers fell 1 3/4 to 44 5/8.    Borg-Warner rose 1 3/8 to 49 5/8. Over the weekend, the company approved a $48.50-a-share tender offer from a Merrill Lynch-backed investor group. The tender offer is designed to thwart a takeover by GAF at $46 a share for the 80.1% of Borg-Warner it doesn't already own. GAF fell 3/4 to 49 5/8.    Dome Petroleum inched up 1/8 to 1 on the American Stock Exchange. TransCanada PipeLines offered to acquire Dome in a cash and stock transaction valued at $4.3 billion (Canadian). Dome, angry because TransCanada violated a confidentiality agreement, broke off talks with the company and said it would hold discussions with other bidders.    Reebok lost 3 5/8 to 41 3/4. The athletic shoemaker announced a gain in first-quarter earnings but also filed an offering of six million common shares with the Securities and Exchange Commission.    Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber eased 1/4 to 59. The company said it expects first-quarter profit from continuing operations of more than $71.2 million, or a $1 a share, compared with a net loss of $60 million a year earlier.    Chemical New York fell 2 to 42 and Irving Bank declined 1 3/4 to 43. Both banks reported a decline in first-quarter earnings.    ---                     Largest Drops of DJIA    Date               Close        Decline       % Chg.
