Under this research effort, conceptswere developed and a software architecture was designed to address thecomplexities of onboard monitoring and diagnosis. This paper describesthe implementation of these concepts in a computer program called FaultFinder.The implementation of the monitoring, diagnosis, and interface functionsas separate modules is discussed, as well as the blackboard designedfor the communication of these modules. Some related issues concerningthe future installation of FaultFinder in an aircraft are also discussed.9 references.</TEXT></DOC>
