While millions sat down to turkey dinners at home, many otherscelebrated the holiday by sharing with the less fortunate: thethousands trying to get back on their feet after natural disasters,the homeless in the cities, and the destitute overseas.   In New York City, the Macy's Thanksgiving Day parade stepped offthis morning despite the first significant Thanksgiving snowfall in51 years and high winds that grounded the Snoopy and Bugs Bunnyballoons.   ``It's a white Thanksgiving!'' cheered parade watcher NoraDeledansky, 12.   Around Charleston, S.C., where shattered homes still bearwitness to the hurricane that killed 29 people Sept. 21 and 22,volunteers will serve up 5,000 turkey dinners at 13 sites forhurricane victims.   ``We got a lot to be thankful for,'' said Charleston CityCouncilman Robert Ford, who represents many of the city's poorerareas. ``Everything we lost in Charleston was mostly materialanyway. People should be grateful for the fact that they have theirlives and health and well-being.''   Besides the dinners sponsored by the Red Cross and the NationalAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People, churches plannedto deliver turkeys and hams to hurricane victims.   On the Isle of Palms, where nearly every house was leveled ordamaged by Hugo's 135 mph wind, officials invited about three dozenresidents, police officers and firefighters for a Thanksgivingdinner.   In San Francisco, the annual Thanksgiving meal for 6,000homeless people at Glide Memorial Church took on new significance.The earthquake that killed 67 and did $7 billion in damage Oct. 17deepened the plight of the homeless by toppling or damaging thecheap hotels where many take shelter.   The Rev. Cecil Williams, pastor of the church in the city'srun-down Tenderloin district, recalled that hundreds volunteered tohelp the homeless after the quake.   ``We have all been through a major earthquake and we havesurvived. We have much to be thankful for,'' Williams said. ``Mostof all, we have a community of people who have been helping eachother and we are going to celebrate that spirit of giving andvolunteering.''   Across the country, the homeless were invited to Thanksgivingmeals at churches and shelters.   Members of Indiana Lions clubs chose Thanksgiving to shareAmerica's plenty with the poor of Guatemala. About 50 Lions set outtoday in a caravan of 16 used ambulances they will donate to theCentral American country, along with 12,000 pairs of usedeyeglasses, 15,000 articles of clothing and assorted medicalsupplies and toys.   At home, families settled down to their turkeys _ 45 millionbirds, according to the National Turkey Federation _ and atelevision diet of parades and football, including two NationalFootball League games.   Snow was falling today in the Northeast, while a storm wasdeveloping over the central Gulf Coast states. Snow fell Wednesdayin the Great Lakes region and parts of the upper Midwest and thePlains.   The wintry cold and snow weren't expected to deter huge crowdsdrawn to New York City's annual parade, also seen on television byan estimated 55 million people. Macy's extravaganza of marchingbands and helium-filled characters is one of many parades aroundthe country that inaugurate the Christmas shopping season.   President Bush, who used the holiday to rejoice at the changessweeping Eastern Europe, planned Thanksgiving dinner at Camp David,Md. On the menu: roast turkey with stuffing, cranberry sauce, sweetpotatoes with marshmallows, green beans, salad and pumpkin andpecan pies.   For long-haul truckers forced to spend the holiday on thehighways, truck stops across the country were cooking up home-stylemeals to serve free. The 39-outlet Truckstops of America chaindoesn't charge for Thanksgiving meals, said Gary Ryan, restaurantmanager at the company's Cleveland headquarters.   In Newark, N.J., hundreds of families offered holiday shelterfor 200 people left homeless by fires that destroyed an apartmentbuilding and two dozen houses on Tuesday.   All of the homeless have found temporary quarters, either inprivate homes or in motels arranged by the Red Cross, and they allare invited to Thanksgiving dinner at the Lighthouse CommunityCenter, said Mayor Sharpe James.   In Hammond, Ind., one judge wants to make sure holiday drinkingdoesn't add to weather hazards on the road.
