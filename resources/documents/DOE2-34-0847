<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-34-0847 </DOCNO><TEXT>Laboratory experiments were carried out on illuminated TiO/sub 2/-electrodesto examine the possibility of conversion and storage of solar radiationin a chemical system especially as hydrogen from the photolysis of water.Methods of preparation of new photosensitive semiconducting electrodeswere studied. For the preparation of the electrodes various techniqueof vapour deposition and surface treatment including ion implantationwere employed. The thin-layered electrodes were characterized by absorptionspectroscopy and by electrochemical methods. The results of the investigationsare published in 29 original contributions quoted as references and in3 PhD thesis of co-workers. Using solar radiation only small yields ofhydrogen were obtained in the photolysis of water on TiO/sub 2/ electrodes.Nevertheless it is concluded that photoelectrochemistry possesses a highpotential in photocatalysis and in investigations of photooxidation processesoccurring in the atmosphere.
