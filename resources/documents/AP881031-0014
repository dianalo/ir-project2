It lasts until sunrise, to be followed intermittently throughthe day by the more distant boom of rockets aimed at the city.   Herat, Afghanistan's third-largest city with a population of106,000, is one of the cities the Moscow-backed governmentconsiders ``safe'' because Soviet troops are still present.   The government professes to be able to defend the city againstU.S.-supported Moslem guerrillas known as mujahedeen, or Islamicholy warriors, even after the Soviet pullout scheduled this winter.   The designation ``safe'' appears to be a delusion, if not anoutright fraud.   The guerrillas are about 12 to 13 miles from the city, accordingto Juma Mohammad, provincial commander of the Sarandoy, aparamilitary armored force considered more loyal and better-trainedthan the Afghan army's rank and file.   But the outgoing fire at night in Herat seems aimed at an enemymuch closer.   Most of what can be heard from the balcony of a governmentbuilding on the northern edge of the city sounds no bigger than.50-caliber _ whose range is about 1{ miles.   The mortars used by Sarandoy troops in Herat's 14th centurycitadel show signs of recent firing and are of the type that has amaximum range of about five miles.   In the Afghan capital of Kabul, non-Soviet bloc diplomatspredict Herat will fall quickly to the mujahedeen after Soviettroops pull out in accordance with a U.N.-mediated accord. Thewithdrawal must be completed by Feb. 15.   But Soviet troops left Kandahar this past summer and themujahedeen still have not dislodged the Afghan garrison and takenthat city, the largest in the country after Kabul, the capital.   Rockets also land in Kabul several times a week, sometimes bythe scores. Most of the time the damage is insignificant.   But the cities are vulnerable, more to siege tactics than to anydirect military attack the mujahedeen can mount with their poorlytargeted rockets.   The capture of Kandahar or Herat would deal a majorpsychological blow to Afghanistan's Soviet-style government.   Afghanistan's mountains afford sanctuary to the mujahedeen butit is the cities they must capture.   Whether they can achieve victory through direct militaryattacks, the mujahedeen are in a good position to isolate thecities from their supplies of food, fuel and militaryreinforcements.   Kabul gets a periodic taste of this when the mujahedeen cut theroads leading to the capital, causing sugar to disappear from themarkets and doubling the prices of dwindling stocks of flour.   Herat is even more vulnerable. Fuel comes from the Soviet Union,a two-hour drive up the 95-mile highway to the Afghan border townof Torghundi when the road is not blocked by winter snows oryear-round guerrillas.   The fuel is needed not only for automobiles, which areoutnumbered in Herat by horse-drawn vehicles and bicycles, but forheating, cooking and running the city's power plant.   The plan provides electricity only from sundown to sunrise andonly for the few relatively prosperous neighborhoods, governmentinstitutions and hospitals.   Herat has never had around-the-clock electricity, not evenbefore the war That began a decade ago when a coup-installedcommunist government took power and quickly required Sovietassistance to survive.   The guerrillas surrounding Herat are led by one of themujahedeen's ablest commanders, Ismail Khan of Jamiat-e-Islami, thelargest of the seven Pakistani-based guerrilla groups.   Main roads and bridges around the city are now guarded by Soviettroops.   Sarandoy commander Mohammad said he has 4,000 men in Heratprovince, 600 of them in Herat city. In addition, he said, thereare 2,000 government-paid village militiamen and 4,000 ``Defendersof the Revolution,'' gun-toting civilians the government pays $4.75to $7.15 a month.   Mohammad said he had no idea how many mujahedeen were outsidethe city.   ``Their activity is too secret. It is difficult to say,'' hesaid in an interview in his office where the second-story windowswere bricked up and sandbagged.     </TEXT></DOC>
