 And, over the years, word processors haveincreased in functionality and friendliness.andP;  But no WP is undergoing aprofound transformation--the move to compound documents.andM;For the first time, word processing is not primarily concerned with theprinting of documents.andP;  The purpose of compound documents is not to create anattractive page layout with error-free text, but to present live data in acontext where it can be easily understood.andM;Compound documents may not be printed at all.andP;  Living documents can existonline, continually being updated as new information is received or existingdata is modified.andM;In our vision of computing in the 1990s, we see a model where a multitude ofworldwide data sources are accessed through communication links, mostlyfront-ended by various sorts of electronic mail systems.andP;  The accessed datais massaged and manipulated through customized applications--agents, filters,automated procedures--and is displayed in a multimedia window intoinformation that puts all the information into the appropriate context forour specific job (see Vol.andP;  13, No.andP;  1).andP;  Today's multimedia window is thecompound document.andM;In this article, we will take a look at what a new-generation word processingsystem will include.andP;  At each step, we will use Microsoft Word for Windows asa case in point, stacking it up against our model for a word processor of the'90s to see how well it fares.andM;Components of a CompoundandM;Document EditorandM;The term compound document tends to bring to mind only the ability to includein a text document different data objects that maintain links to their sourcefiles.andP;  And, indeed, this is the primary advantage to a compound documentenvironment.andP;  But, to be considered a word processor for the '90s, a producthas to offer much more.andM;OBJECT ORIENTATION.andP;  A new-generation word processor must understand objects.andO;An obvious instance of this is linking live data.andM;Live Links.andP;  Many word processors can include data linked to a source filefrom a different application, though, at this time, most are limited tograpics links.andP;  Several allow links from spreadsheets (both WordPerfect andWord, the leading PC word processing packages, offer this capability).andP;  Andit's true that when the source file is changed, the referenced material alsoupdates.andP;  But a word processor must do more than display referenced data; itmust also be able to include referenced data objects.andP;  An object includesboth the data and the program required to process that data.andP;  This means thatyou can manipulate the source data from within the compound document.andO;DECwrite, for example, supports this capability.andP;  When you select, say, asection of spreadsheet data linked to a source file, the original file andits application open in a window.andP;  You can manipulate the spreadsheet, and,when you save the file, the updated data displays in the document.andM;With an object-oriented model for importing live data, new data types, suchas voice or video, can be added more easily.andP;  Objects are self-definingcontainers for program functions and data.andP;  The word processor doesn't needto know how to manipulate the data, just how to contain the object.andM;Structured Documents.andP;  Another area where object orientation belongs innew-generation word processing is in the structure of a document.andP;  Structureddocuments break down a document into different named objects.andP;  A documentobject could be an imported image, a linked spreadsheet, a text paragraph,etc.andP;  Every character in the document can, itself, be an object.andP;  Theparadigm usually associated with text objects are paragraph styles orcomponents.andP;  Most word processors today provide style sheets, where you candefine the formatting properties of a paragraph, and every paragraph (orsection of text--the term &quot;paragraph&quot; is used only for convenience) assignedthat name will assume those properties.andP;  Structured paragraphs go one stepfarther.andP;  Instead of just modifying formatting by style name, you canactually manipulate a paragraph by its name.andP;  The Interleaf publishing systemis a good example of this.andM;Interleaf's Component Manipulation.andP;  On the Interleaf screen (seeIllustration 3), the black area at the left displays the names of thecomponents within the document.andP;  By selecting just the component name, youcan prove, copy, or delete the entire block of data.andP;  You can also change theformatting by renaming the component.andP;  Interleaf provides even furtherfunctionality based on component name.andP;  The feature is called EffectivityControl, and it is one of the more powerful abilities we've run across.andP;  WithEffectivity Control, you can select which components should be in effect forviewing or printing.andP;  For example, if you have a single document whichcontains instructions for both the PC and Macintosh versions of a softwareproduct, you can label all components that apply only to the PC withappropriate component names.andP;  Similarly, all Mac sections have appropriatecomponent names.andP;  Any section that applies to both products has anotherconvention for component-naming.andP;  When you want to view or print only the Macinstructions, you can put the common components and the Mac components ineffect, hiding the PC components.andP;  The result will paginate correctly as ifthe PC material did not exist.andP;  But you haven't lost that material.andP;  You canput those sections into effect anytime you wish.andM;Interleaf can control effectivity because it has made each component into anobject that can be manipulated by name.andM;Hierarchical Structure.andP;  But there is even more to document structure thannamed components.andP;  Structure can also be hierarchical, allowing the user tospecify the hierarchy of components in a document.andP;  For example, a chapterhead component must alway be followed by a section head component.andP;  And,conversely, a section head may never immediately precede a chapter head.andO;Applix's Alis integrated office product supports hierarchical styles in itscompound document editor.andP;  The hierarchical understands, for example, thatlevel 1 of an outline will be followed by level 1.1, or that a bulleted itemwill be followed by another bulleted item.andP;  Of course, the hierarchy in theseexamples can be manually (and easily) bypassed if the hierarchical structuredoesn't fit the situation--sometimes you just need one bullet.andM;Dynamic Outlining.andP;  With structure and hierarchies in a document, you cancreate dynamic outlines.andP;  Most self-respecting word processing packages offeroutline numbering with the ability to promote and demote the numbering ofentries at each level (e.g., move a heading labeled 1.1 down one level to1.1.1, etc.).andP;  However, too few offer the ability to create a dynamicoutline, where subordinate levels and body text can be hidden, and wheremoving a head moves all the subheads and body text associated with it.andM;Why does this excite us?andP;  Reducing a document to its outline form allows youto reorganize and move data around quickly and simply without losingrelationships.andP;  Say, for example, the headings in my document are as follows:andM;I.andP;  SEASONSandM;A.andP;  Summer 1.andP;  Water Sports 2.andP;  Fruits and Vegetables B. Winter 1.andP;  Snow Gear2.andP;  Driving Conditions C. Spring 1.andP;  Flowers 2.andP;  April Showers D. Autumn 1.andO;Indian Summer 2.andP;  Falling LeavesandM;Each heading has body text related to it.andP;  If I decide to rearrange myseasons, instead of having to highlight all the text (and or graphics,tables, etc.) associated with Autumn and move it before Spring, I can reducemy outline to display only up to the second level:andM;I.andP;  SEASONSandM;A.andP;  Summer B. Winter C. Spring D. AutumnandM;Now I only have to move one line up.andP;  All hidden text moves with theappropriate header.andM;WORKGROUP CONSIDERATIONS.andP;  Object orientation provides the means of combiningvarious types of data into a single container, the compound document, and forproviding structure so that you easily manipulate this data to make it moremeaningful.andP;  Now we have to consider the workgroup when looking atnew-generation word processing offerings.andM;Security.andP;  Because of the nature of compound documents, a mixture of datafrom various sources, no individual user can claim ownership of the document.andO;Thus, there needs to be adequate security to preserve the integrity of thedocument, yet allow a variety of users to work with ease on the containingdocument and on the source files.andP;  The implications surrounding security areenormous.andP;  If someone clobbers a source spreadsheet, he or she could becorrupting dozens of documents which contain that spreadsheet object.andP;  Theissue of who provides the security is also of primary concern.andP;  Is it aplatform issue?andP;  A networking issue?andP;  An applications issue?andP;  If theapplication is responsible, which one?andP;  The compound document editor?andP;  Eachapplication that contributes objects to the documents?andP;  This bed of thorns isstill to be worked out.andM;Mailing Compound Documents.andP;  Compound documents are meant to be shared, and,in the '90s, that means that documents are mailed transparently worldwide.andO;Before compound documents, the paramount issue was format conversin: Can myword processor read a document created in another?andP;  But a whole new can ofworms is opened up when you consider the live links within a compounddocument.andP;  Now we have to consdier whether mailing a document breaks thoselinks, sending just the current version of the data, or whether the pointersto the source files are maintained.andM;A related issue is considering what happens when a source file is moved.andO;Does the change in location ripple through to all documents that referencethis file?andP;  Is a pointer placed at the old location indicating where the filewent?andP;  Again, whose problem is this?andM;One solution is to mail all referenced documents with the compound document.andO;And this works, but it isn't ideal because you are duplicating files all overthe system and taking up valuable storage space.andP;  As it becomes more commonto mail files with a multitude of links, the system can get mucked up in ahurry.andM;Tools for Collaboration.andP;  The larger issues of sharing compound documentsaren't necessarily the province of the word processing vendor.andP;  But certaintools that support the collaborative process are.andM;There are many functions that are considered group tools--project management,electronic mail, computer conferencing, to name a few--but the functions thatfall into the word processing arena are features for collaborative editing.andM;Group Editors.andP;  Ideally, a group editor would allow any number ofindividuals, with the proper permission, to work on different sections of asingle document simultaneously.andP;  So while you are working on the introductionparagraph, I may be working on the description of the first chapter.andP;  Inorder for this model to work, sections of a document must becomeobjects--objects that can be locked, much as records are locked in a databasefile.andP;  More than one person may access a datafile simultaneously, but onlyone user may modify a record at a single point in time.andM;As yet, no word processor offers this capability.andP;  That's not surprising,because the security required to ensure the integrity of such a document,especially a compound document, is very difficult to implement.andP;  But thereare many product that offer some sort of first steps on the road to thisobject-editable document model.andM;Most word processing packages allow you to group a number of separatedocuments together, consecutively numbering the pages, illustrations,footnotes, etc., and creating a single table of contents and index.andP;  Theadvantage to this model is that each document can be edited by a differentperson while the integrity of the complete work is maintained.andP;  Thedisadvantage is that, in most cases, the new document begins on a new page,which means that you have to divide the master work at a section or chapterbeginning.andP;  Also, you often have more than one person editing data just aparagraph apart, not a chapter apart.andP;  Breaking down the master work intodozens of tiny pieces may allow a lot of paragraphs to be edited at one time,but it destroys the context in which the editing is done.andM;Redlining is one of the more familiar group editing features.andP;  When we talkabout redlining, we mean automatic redlining, where you insert and deletetext (or graphics, etc.) in a Redline mode.andP;  The inserted text appears in onefont, and the deleted text in another font.andP;  (Some systems insist theyprovide redlining, but what they really offer is the ability to insert textin a specific mode an to mark text for deleting by changing the mode tostrikethrough.)andP;  On most of these systems, you can either restore thedocument to its original condition or accept all the redlining.andP;  If you wantto make only selected changes, you must do them manually.andP;  Some more advancedproducts allow you to automatically select redlined items to include orexclude.andP;  A few systems also indicate who has made the suggested edit byincluding each editor's initials alongside the redlined section.andM;Another feature that includes the editors' initials is Annotation.andO;Annotations are comments about the content of a document rather than actualediting changes.andP;  Annotations indicate who has made them so you can get moreclarification if necessary or decide if you really want to make the change atall--there are some colleagues whose advice you may want to avoid.andO;Annotations do not need to be typed in.andP;  Systems such as Wang's FreeStyleallow you to use voice annotation--you record a voice message (object), andan icon in the text indicates that a message is there.andP;  Selecting the iconplays the tape.andP;  FreeStyle also allows you to handwrite--or scribble--amessage using a stylus and pad.andP;  The annotation is an image.andM;The FreeStyle multimedia methods are indicators of the directions inannotation.andP;  The best systems will combine all of these features--groupediting on an object level, automatic redlining with selective use of edits,and multimedia methods of annotation, indicating who is making thesuggestion.andM;STANDARD FEATURES.andP;  We can't forget the standard editing features that madeword processing great.andP;  From move-and-copy to word wrap to automatic indents,word processors have made our lives easier since the mid 1970s.andP;  Just becausewe have added entire new concepts not even conceived of in the mid '70s, thatdoesn't eliminate the need for good, old-fashioned functionality.andM;Editing Features.andP;  The new generation of word processors will continue tooffer standard editing features, such as move-and-copy andsearch-and-replace.andP;  In the past few years, greater focus has been placed onauthoring aids, such as spelling correctors and thesauruses.andP;  Grammarcorrection is the next area to become common.andP;  Currently, there are severalpopular PC-based products, such as Grammatik and RightWriter, that canoperate with most word processing packages.andP;  We will see more tightintegration with the word processors over the next few years.andM;Formatting Features.andP;  Besides the standard tabs, margins, and indenting,formatting has taken on a new life with the advances in WYSIWYG displays,style sheets, and desktop publishing features such as font control.andP;  Over thenext few years, many of these publishing features, such as side bar flow(when text flows from a box on one page to a box on a different,nonconsecutive page), will be enhanced.andP;  The use of style sheets will be derigueur, and the capabilities of these styles will become object oriented.andO;Table generation, including basic spreadsheet-like calculations, is becomingan important capability.andP;  Several word processing packages, includingWordPerfect 5.1, offer the ability to automatically create and dynamicallymodify (using the mouse or keyboard) cellular tables.andM;DOCUMENT MANAGEMENT.andP;  The complexity of our filing systems increasessignificantly with the advances in compound documents.andP;  Keeping track of alldocument objects becomes a monumental task.andP;  Full-text search and retrievalsystems, which are just now becoming really useful (i.e., sufficiently fast)will grow into full-object search and retrieval.andM;File directories will continue to move in the direction of objectorientation.andP;  In most graphical windowing environments, clicking on a filename will access both the file and the application needed to process thefile.andP;  And directories will also become more iconized.andP;  Windows 3.0 willfeature fully iconized directories.andP;  Most of the other environments on themarket already do.andM;But directories will start to offer even more functionality.andP;  In someenvironments, you can move files from one directory to another by draggingthe icon.andP;  And triggers will begin to be added.andP;  A trigger, such as thosefound in Applix's Alis office system, is an action that occurs when a file ismanipulated from the director.andP;  For example, a trigger can be set up to sendan E-mail message to a specified distribution list whenever a certain file isaccessed.andM;STANDARD ENVIRONMENTS AND PLATFORMS.andP;  We have moved into the era ofstandardization in a big way.andP;  Proprietary platforms are becoming taboo.andP;  Thenew generation of word processors will operate on standardplatforms--Macintosh, DOS, OS/2, and Unix (though they may also run onproprietary operating systems, most likely MVS and/or VM and MVS).andP;  Theproducts will also run under one or more of the standard graphical windowingenvironments--the Macintosh environment, MS Windows for DOS, PresentationManager for OS/2, and one of the many implementations of X-Windows (mostlikely Motif and possibly Open Look) for Unix.andM;Interoperability.andP;  No matter which platform(s) a specific product runs on,the software must interoperate, both with versions of the same productsrunning on different platforms and with different products running on thesame or different platforms.andP;  For example, a document created in Word for theMac must be able to be mailed to a user on a Unix system and converted intoWordPerfect Unix format.andP;  The conversion should be transparent to the user,based on the E-mail profile that will indicate the user's standard wordprocessing package.andM;Similarly, users on different word processing software on different platformsshould be able to access and modify any file (to which they have accesspermission) regardless of the originating software.andP;  Again, these conversionswill eventually be transparent.andP;  Looking back at our group editing model,this will mean that each editor can open up a section object within themaster document in a different editor.andM;Cross-Application Macros.andP;  We haven't mentioned macros in our discussion ofword processing in the '90s.andP;  And that is because macros should not be boundby a single application, even an application as far reaching as a compounddocument editor.andP;  Cross-application macros will become part of the graphicalwindowing environment.andP;  A good model for this is the HP NewWave Agentfacility.andP;  Commands and keystrokes (mouse clicks) can be stored while movingfrom application to application.andP;  This creates a script which can then beedited.andP;  An agent can also be scripted from scratch.andM;Presently, these scripting languages are more complex and syntax intensivethan we'd like.andP;  Though they are not really more complicated than, say, aLotus macro, there is a whole world of perfectly intelligent users who findLotus macros beyond them.andP;  We anticipate that macro languages will becomemore natural language-based and, thus, much easier to use.andM;The Next GenerationandM;In this article, we have discussed the major components of a compounddocument editor as well as the implications of these components.andP;  The biggestbarrier to compound documents is not technology, however, but a lack ofmarket acceptance.andP;  Compound document editors have been around for manyyears--I saw my first one at Comdex 1982.andP;  But none has been reallysuccessful.andP;  When DECwrite was announced, we rejoiced.andP;  We figured that, atlast, there was a vendor with sufficient clout to educate the market.andP;  But,the last we heard, Digital sales representatives were selling DECwrite as anoffice publishing system.andP;  We were told that this was the only way peoplewould buy it, but we suspect that the sales force doesn't fully understandthe concept of living compound documents and is more comfortable selling intoan established market with a product that has superior features to manydesktop publishers.andM;Our hunch is that the user community, as well as the vendor sales forces,will reach a collective &quot;I got it!&quot; within a year.andP;  The market focus onobject orientation will help; one of the easiest ways to explain objects isin the context of a compound document.andP;  So we see these two prevailingtechnologies explaining each other.andM;Once the value of compound documents is perceived--the containers which putlive data from various sources into understandable context--the next step isto figure out the thorny issues of security and object management.andP;  Then it'son to multimedia objects...shared libraries of objects...a vast array ofworldwide data objects just waiting to be accessed and put into a documentformat where they can be useful to all of us.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
