MaclinkPlus.andP;  MacLinkPlusnot only provides the mechanism to transmit data between the two computers,but it also offers &quot;translators&quot; for more than 45 applications, ranging fromspreadsheets to database programs.andP;  These translators convert incompatibleDOS files to the Mac format, while preserving the original file's formattingcommands.andM;MacLinkPlus allows two ways to exchange files: via a connection directlythrough the two computers' serial ports or via a modem hookup (see Figure 1).andM;Another easy-to-implement solution comes from Dayna Communications' (SaltLake City) DaynaFile external disk drive.andP;  DaynaFile allows a Mac to readfiles from or write files to an MS-DOS diskette; it supports the MAc filesystem, so DOS files and disks appear on the Mac screen as standard Macicons.andP;  Like MacLinkPlus, DaynaFile also offers a translation function toconvert DOS files to the Mac format.andM;On to NetworksandM;These products are inadequate for exchanging files between groups of Macs andMS-DOS computers; that's where networking applications such as Apple'sAppleShare and AppleShare/PC, 3Com's 3+ and 3+ for Mac, Sitka's TOPS, andNovell's NetWare begin to make sense.andM;Naturally, networks require more complicated hardware and softwarearrangements.andP;  Networks need cabling to connect the various computers,network interface cards (NICs) inside each networked computer, a networkoperating system (NOS), and a file server.andP;  For Mac-PC connectivity, the fileserver must be capable of communicating with both Macs and PCs.andM;Figure 2 illustrates a typical mixed Mac-PC network environment.andP;  In thisLAN, a LocalTalk network (right) comprised of Macs is linked to an Ethernetvia a dedicated file server.andP;  Because LocalTalk connections are built intoevery Macintosh, the Macs on this segment do not require add-in NICs.andM;That's not the case for the server (a Compaq in this example) and thecomputers on the Ethernet segment.andP;  Because the server requires connection toeach type of cabling, it must contain two NICs--one for Ethernet, one forLocalTalk.andP;  These adapters provide the physical connection to the twoworkgroups.andP;  In the case of Ethernet, the connection could be via coax cable,twisted-pair wiring, or fiber-optic cable; in LocalTalk, the connection couldbe over Farallon's unshielded twisted-pair (TP) wiring scheme or Apple'sproprietary shielded TP.andP;  The other computers, including the Macs, on theEthernet workgroup must also contain an Ethernet NIC.andM;Each nonserver computer on the network must also be operating under &quot;client&quot;software, which provides the PC or Mac with the commands it needs to &quot;look&quot;to the network and exchange files with the server.andM;The File Server's RoleandM;In addition to providing the physical interface between the two differentcabling schemes, the file server in this network also would perform a varietyof other tasks.andP;  First of all, it must provide all the common file-serverservices, particularly data-and-application storage and retrieval.andP;  Thesecapabilities are controlled and manipulated by a NOS.andM;Because this is a mixed PC-Mac environment, this NOS must be extra &quot;smart&quot;:It must &quot;understand&quot; both the Mac and MS-DOS file systems.andP;  It must also beable to provide data-translation functions that permit users of Macintoshesto access files created and stored by the user of an IBM PC or compatible,and vice versa.andM;Without these capabilities, Mac-PC connectivity would be severely limited.andO;Networked Macintoshes and PCs could share server disk space and perhaps mighteven be able to read some data files created by the other.andM;But the level of functionality available would not be the true transparentMacintosh-PC connectivity required by users of today's increasingly complexheterogenous networks.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
