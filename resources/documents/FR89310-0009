The effect of this action is to approve a source-specificRACT determination made by the State in accordance with commitments specifiedin its Ozone Attainment Plan approved by EPA on July 6, 1983 (48 FR 31026).This action is being taken in accordance with Section 110 of the CleanAir Act.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>This rule will become effective on April 10, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Copies of the documents relevant to this action areavailable for public inspection during normal business hours at the EnvironmentalProtection Agency, Region I, JFK Federal Building, Rm. 2311, Boston, MA02203; Division of Air and Hazardous Materials, 211 Promenade Street, Providence,RI 02908; Public Information Reference Unit, Environmental Protection Agency,401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and the office of the FederalRegister, 1100 L Street, NW., Room 8301, Washington, DC.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Robert C.

The consent agreement establishesand imposes RACT to control VOC emissions from Tech. RACT must be definedfor Tech under Rhode Island SIP Regulation No. 15, subsection 15.5, ``MiscellaneousFacilities Emitting 100 tons/year or more.''On May 25, 1988, EPA called for revisions to the Rhode Island Ozone AttainmentPlan because of persistent violations of the ozone National Ambient AirQuality Standard (NAAQS) in Rhode Island. As such, the State is requiredto begin the planning process and revise its demonstration of attainment.However, this revision will not affect Rhode Island's ability to demonstrateattainment in the future since the revision strengthens the State's federally-approvedSIP. This revision simply makes an emission limit for an unregulated VOCemitting source part of Rhode Island's federally enforceable SIP, as requiredby the State's 1982 Ozone Attainment Plan.The version of the consent agreement originally submitted to EPA on May6, 1987, contained language which could have allowed Tech to bubble tomeet the RACT emission limit. As discussed in the NPR, the DEM's requestfor parallel processing stated that language which could allow Tech tobubble would not be included in the final consent agreement submitted asa formal SIP revision request. On January 4, 1988, the DEM submitted anaddendum to the consent agreement which removed the language which couldhave been used by Tech to meet RACT on a facility-wide daily basis. Theconsent agreement we are approving requires that Tech meet its RACT emissionlimit on each line on a continuous basis.The revision and the rationale for EPA's action were explained in the NPRand will not be restated here. No public comments were received on theNPR.<ITAG tagnum="84">Final Action</ITAG>EPA is approving the consent agreement submitted by the DEM as a SIP revisionrequest for Tech in Woonsocket, RI. The consent agreement requires Techto meet a RACT emission limit of 3.5 pounds VOC/gallon of coating (minuswater) on a solids applied basis.The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit by May 9, 1989. This action may not be challenged later in proceedingsto enforce requirements.
