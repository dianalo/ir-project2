He owns a car, attends De Anza College and is spending this winterbreak with the family he avoided all through his disastrous slide intohomelessness.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Local  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  REACHING THOSE ON THE EDGE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     His recovery is thanks in part to a new program run by Outreach, a San Josenon-profit agency providing transportation and other services to the disabledand the frail elderly in Santa Clara County.;   It mediated between the41-year-old Hassel and the Social Security Administration, which could notrelease his disability benefits because of a past drug and alcohol problem.Instead, the administration ordered Hassel to find a third party, known as a&quot;representative payee,&quot; to take over his finances.;   Outreach began itsprogram last year with a 10-month grant from the Social SecurityAdministration, which recognized the need to find representative payees forpeople whose family members could not help them. The agency now meets theprogram's $90,000-a-year budget with client fees -- $25 a month per person --about $25,000 in county funds and some private donations.;   Each month, theprogram serves about 160 people, young and old, male and female. Most are onestep from being institutionalized -- in a jail, hospital or mental healthfacility. Public agencies also perform the function, but usually only in themost extreme cases. Outreach serves people before they go over the edge.;  &quot;If (the client) had gone totally off the wall and fit (the bureaucracy's)duly diagnosed criteria, there is a program for him,&quot; said Colleen Hudgen, anadministrator with Outreach. &quot;Or if he had become a danger to others, there isa program for him. But for people who fall between the cracks, there are noprograms.&quot;;   Unlike Hassel, most of those served by Outreach are nothomeless. But they easily could become so if no one paid their bills.;   Oneexample is a disabled woman with a drug problem, who was living with hermother.;   The mother assumed responsibility for her daughter's bills, butthey fought each month. Finally, the mother decided she couldn't live with herdaughter and handle her finances.;   &quot;The mother said, 'I just can't fightwith her anymore,' &quot; Hudgen said. &quot;So we send the mother a check with her nameon it for rent and send the daughter money for food and personal needs money.It works to alleviate that big fight every month. And they can livetogether.&quot;;   In John's case, much of the problem was anger at thebureaucracy. It took him more than four years to convince Social Securityofficials he was disabled, due to a combination of physical injury,schizophrenia and drug and alcohol abuse.;   When he finally did, and theagency awarded him $630 a month in benefits, along with $25,000 in back payfor the years he spent destitute in the streets, he was doubly furious that itwould not allow him to control the money.;   Hassel also resisted Outreach atfirst. His caseworker had to coax him out from under the bridge in Palo Altoby refusing to give him money for vacations or major purchases until he agreedto find housing.;   At first, he would stay only in motels that charged himabout $35 a night. But soon, he moved into a single-room occupancy hotel inMountain View, where he paid $480 a month in rent.;   Then he got his reward:a 1977 metallic blue Sedan de Ville that he bought in mint condition for themodest sum of $3,000, followed by his first trip home in a decade. He went tothe Chicago area, where he visited his brothers and two grown daughters hehadn't seen since they were about 5 and 6 years old.;   Now he has just over asemester to go before graduating. His drinking is under control and Hudgenthinks Hassel will be able to persuade Social Security officials to let himtake over his finances by spring.;   Most important, Hassel, once anelectronics technician, may soon be ready to re-enter the labor force and getoff public assistance.;   &quot;I'm determined enough to keep going and I don'tthink I'll fail,&quot; he said. It is a long way from where he started.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LAURA KURTZMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911218  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  December  </MONTH><PG.COL>  1B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  753  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, December 18, 199100353108,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
