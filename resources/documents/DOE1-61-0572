<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-61-0572 </DOCNO><TEXT>In recent years ultrasound imaging and Doppler blood flow measurementshave become important tools for use in diagnostic medicine. Commercialpulse-echo imaging equipment was first introduced into commerce in 1963.The first commercial continuous wave Doppler unit was introduced to themarketplace in 1966. As equipment improved and applications developed,the industry experienced rapid growth in the 1970s. One of the more recentgrowth areas in the application of diagnostic ultrasound has been theuse of pulsed Doppler equipment for cardiac applications. Prior to 1976,some continuous wave Doppler ultrasound was used for cardiovascular diagnosis.However, only a single manufacturer marketed a pulsed Doppler clinicalinstrument for cardiac or peripheral vascular diagnosis. Currently, manycontinuous wave and pulsed Doppler instruments are commercially availablefor both peripheral vascular and cardiac diagnosis. This chapter (1)briefly reviews current safety guidelines, regulations, and recommendationsfor diagnostic ultrasound; (2) discusses the patient-exposure intensitiesassociated with Doppler ultrasound medical equipment and compare theselevels of exposure with intensities from other medical ultrasound devices;and (3) considers some of the current information as it relates to thesafety of diagnostic ultrasound.</TEXT></DOC>
