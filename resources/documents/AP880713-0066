The chairman of the research organization, U.R. Rao, was quotedas saying the exact cause of the launch failure had not beendetermined.   The rocket carried a 330-pound satellite designed to photographEarth and conduct experiments. The satellite was to enter an orbitabout 240 miles above Earth, scientists said.
