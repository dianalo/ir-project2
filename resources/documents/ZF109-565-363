Bryant concluded in his decision.andO;Nevertheless, he added, Inslaw has cited no substantive laws to support itsrequest or give the court jurisdiction to act on the company's behalf.andM;Despite the recent ruling, Hamilton vowed to continue pushing forinvestigations into Justice's activities involving Promis.andP;  He said he iswaiting eagerly for the results of a re view begun by the House JudiciaryCommittee.andM;But with the coming holidays, the budget crunch and November elections, acommittee investigator said the likelihood of any action by this year isslim.andP;  Hamilton says he can wait.andM;Meanwhile, Inslaw and Justice have been holding mediation discussions.andO;Neither Justice officials nor Hamilton would discuss these meetings.andP;  Butafter so many years of struggle, it seems unlikely that Hamilton would walkaway pleased with a settlement agreement unless Justice agreed to acknowledgeat least some of the improprieties he has alleged.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
