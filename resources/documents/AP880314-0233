It was her last sight of her troubled homeland.   With her husband, Elie, and their two sons, she was getting awayfrom Lebanon's violence and economic chaos of 13 years of civil warfor a new life in Canada.   For Lebanon's 900,000 Christians, penned up in a enclave northof Beirut by the war, the 8,187-ton Empress and its sister ship,the Sunny Boat, are their only way out of Lebanon.   Beirut's airport is in Moslem-controlled territory on the otherside of the capital's dividing Green Line and is unsafe forChristians. Jounieh, 13 miles north of Beirut, is the Christians'only passenger port.   Mrs. Akiki spent the entire voyage staring out of a porthole,sometimes weeping as she sailed into an unknown future in a strangeland.   The white-painted Empress and the Sunny Boat shuttle betweenJounieh and Larnaca on the south coast of Cyprus every day withbizarre cargoes of humanity, dispirited Lebanese, commutingbusinessmen, security agents, gamblers, and sometimes hashishrunners.   During the nine-hour night-time voyage across the easternMediterranean, the Empress becomes Lebanon in microcosm, mirroringthe despair and hopelessness of its feuding people.   In the lounge, a band pounds out pop tunes. In the all-nightcasino, Lebanese high-rollers crowd around the roulette andblackjack tables and the bank of a dozen slot machines.   The action never stops. But few are few winners, said one of thecroupiers, identifying himself only as Tanious.   ``These people drop thousands of dollars every night. It'samazing. Some of them are regulars on the boat and they rarely getoff ahead of the game.''   Before he joined the Empress last summer, Tanious said, he was afighter with the Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia.   So was Elias, 24, one of the crewmen. He said he took the$100-a-month job ``because I don't want to fight any more.''   Elias said he has been wounded three times fighting Moslems andleftists in the war.   ``I want to get out for good, but no one will give me a visa.One of these days maybe I'll meet an American lady, or an Englishlady, on the boat and I'll marry her and get myself a newpassport.''   Elias and one of his friends among the 200-member crew admittedthat part of their job is to gather information for the LebaneseForces about travelers heading for Lebanon.   With Cyprus increasingly used by the Middle East's undergroundorganizations, foreign intelligence agencies, gunrunners and drugsmugglers, the Empress and the Sunny Boat attract the attention ofLebanese and Cypriot authorities as well.   Passengers are checked and closely questioned by the Lebanesesecurity officials and Cypriot police during the voyage.   Cypriot customs officers regularly arrest Lebanese fordrug-smuggling after the ferryboats dock, although they admit thebig rings use high-speed boats to ship their hashish and heroingrown in Lebanon's Bekaa Valley.   The Empress is well known in the eastern Mediterranean. Itevacuated Palestinian guerrillas from Beirut after Israel's 1982invasion of Lebanon.   The following year, it carried Yasser Arafat and his PLOguerrillas when they were pushed out of their last Lebanesestronghold in the northern port of Tripoli by Syrian-backeddissidents.   In December, Israeli gunboats intercepted it and forced it toturn back to Larnaca because they suspected it was carryingPalestinian guerrillas to Lebanon as part of Arafat's effort torebuild his onetime power base.   Lebanese Foreign Ministry officials estimate that as many as 1million Lebanese have been granted emigration visas in the lastthree years.   Businessman Jean Mubarak was heading for Larnaca aboard theEmpress to catch a plane for Montreal after receiving initialacceptance as an immigrant from Canadian authorities.   Two of his brothers have lived in Montreal for three years andhe was going to take a look at the country where he and his familywill make their new home.   ``What's it like in Montreal?'' he asked Akiki, also bound forMontreal with his family. ``I hear it's really cold in winter andI'm worried if my children will able to bear it there.''   ``Anything's better than the gunbattles and shelling, the powercuts,'' Akiki replied. ``I want a better life for myself and myfamily.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Wed PMs March 23</NOTE></DOC>
