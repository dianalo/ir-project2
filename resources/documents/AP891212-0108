LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Britain on Tuesday defended its first forcedrepatriation of 51 Vietnamese from Hong Kong and challengedcountries that protested to open their doors instead.   The United States urged Britain to halt mandatory repatriation.Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said it was ``unacceptableuntil conditions improve in Vietnam.''   Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said there would be no moreforced repatriations until a House of Commons debate on Dec. 19,although he said Britain still plans to deport 44,000 Vietnamesefrom its colony.   ``Unless it is clear to people in Vietnam that those who do notqualify as refugees will be returned to Vietnam, Hong Kong facesthe prospect of tens of thousands more arrivals in 1990. This issimply not an acceptable prospect,'' he said.   The United States, Canada and the international human rightsorganization Amnesty International had appealed to Britain to haltthe repatriation.   But Hong Kong security forces went ahead, rousting 51 Vietnamesemen, women and children from their beds before dawn Tuesday andputting them on a chartered jet to Hanoi. Vietnam accepted them butcriticized the action.   ``This conjures up every picture I have in my mind of World WarII concentration camps,'' said Rep. Chet Atkins, D-Mass., inWashington. ``How can the British forget history's most agonizinglesson and repeat so many of its horrors?''   Hong Kong houses about 57,000 Vietnamese boat people, more than90 percent from North Vietnam, in squalid camps rife with violenceand malnutrition. There were fears that the first forcedrepatriations might touch off protests but a Hong Kong governmentspokesman said Tuesday night that the camps were quiet.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said it was more humane torepatriate Vietnamese who cannot prove they face politicalpersecution than to keep them indefinitely in overcrowded camps.   ``Those countries who are protesting at their return would dofar better if they offered to take some of them,'' she told theHouse of Commons, amid taunts and jeers from the opposition.   ``Those countries which have shown anger about it have not evenagreed to take any of the 13,000 genuine refugees (in Hong Kong)for whom we are still seeking a home,'' she said. Britishgovernment sources noted that the United States was reluctant totake refugees from North Vietnam.   U.S. State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said the UnitedStates believed Britain should ``grant asylum to all those personsfrom Vietnam who seek it.''   ``While we may have differences with the British on this action,we both agree that conditions inside Vietnam are the root cause ofthe problem,'' Boucher added. ``We hope we can work together todeal with this.''   British opposition leader Neil Kinnock accused Mrs. Thatcher ofacting ``tyranically'' and demanded: ``What excuse have you got forgiving instructions that in the middle of the night, armed riotpolice raid children, women and men, shove them into caged lorries(trucks) and forcibly deport them to the country from which theyfled?''   Mrs. Thatcher denied the police were armed. She said theinternational conference on Indochinese refugees in June agreed toresettle genuine refugees and return those not at risk frompolitical persecution to Vietnam.   Britain said the expelled Vietnamese were ``economic migrants.''Hurd stressed that the criteria for qualifying as a refugee wasdecided by Britain in agreement with the United Nations HighCommissioner for Refugees, and that every Vietnamese had a right ofappeal.   The U.N. group said Tuesday it regards the forced repatriationof the 51 Vietnamese as premature, but said it was satisfied thatnone of them were genuine refugees.   The group has refused to take part in any mandatory return. Itis coordinating a voluntary repatriation plan, strongly backed bythe United States, under which 637 Vietnamese have returned sinceMarch. More than 1,000 are registered to go back.   Japan's Kyodo News Service quoted a Vietnamese Foreign Ministrystatement in Hanoi as saying Vietnam in principle has acceptedvoluntary returnees but ``will refuse flatly forced repatriation.''   Hong Kong's action this time ``violates humanitarianism,'' theForeign Ministry was quoted as saying, but that the 51 Vietnamesewould be accepted.   Hurd said voluntary repatriation ``will not match the scale ofthe problem,'' and said Britain hoped to get Vietnam's agreement toaccept returnees, voluntary and involuntary, at a faster rate.   Vietnam had told Britain that those repatriated would not bepunished for leaving, he said. Government sources said there hadbeen no problems with those who previously returned homevoluntarily.   The British Embassy in Hanoi will monitor conditions of thoseforcibly repatriated, Hurd said. Britain also wants the U.N. groupto participate in the monitoring, although it has so far refused,government sources said.   Hurd said two former ministers, Conservative Timothy RaisonLaborite Lord Ennals, will visit Vietnam next month to report onthe condition of the 51 boat people sent back Tuesday.</TEXT></DOC>
