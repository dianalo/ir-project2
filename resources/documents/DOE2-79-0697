The cost of the projectthat came in under budget was $2.1 billion. Some $600 million was equitymoney the partners put in, and $1.5 billion was financed with a loanissued by the Federal Financing Bank and guaranteed by the Departmentof Energy. The plant is located near Beulah, North Dakota, and is thenation's first and only commercial coal gasification plant, built purposelyto produce synthetic natural gas (SNG) of pipeline quality. In 1974,12,000 tons of lignite (at today's production rate this is approximatelyone day's feed stock of coal) was sent to South Africa and test ran inSASOL's plant. This was eventually followed by preliminary engineeringand detailed plant design in 1979. In 1981, funding finally took shapeand construction began in August of that year. In the fall of 1983, start-upactivities began, and on July 28, 1984, SNG went to the interstate pipelinesystem. In 1985, the plant was essentially fully operational, makingSNG at rates up to design capacity (137.5 MMSCFD). On August 1, 1985,the partnership defaulted on the project due to the declining economicsof SNG. At this point the Department of Energy (DOE) assumed controlof the project. ANG has continued to operate the project for the DOEsince then. Currently the DOE is actively pursuing private ownershipof the facility.</TEXT></DOC>
