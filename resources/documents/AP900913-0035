He wants cash to get farmers to stop growingcoca and for highway construction so alternate crops can make it tomarket.   Because the aid package ``is destined only for the fight againstdrug trafficking, we are not going to sign this agreement,''President Alberto Fujimori said Wednesday night.   His statement appeared to torpedo any hope his 6-week-oldgovernment will accept the $35.9 million in military aid Washingtonis offering this year to fight the cocaine trade.   Peru could use the money. The country is reeling from theeffects of tough austerity measures aimed at curbing 3,000 percentannual inflation.   The government is also battling a 10-year-old insurgency byMaoist-inspired rebels, who have allied themselves with cocainetraffickers in return for money and arms.   Fujimori has warned on several occasions that he would not signthe military aid agreement with the United States unless itincluded economic aid to wean farmers away from growing coca, fromwhich cocaine is produced.   He has also said Peru needs help in developing alternative cropsand in building a paved highway from regions where coca is now kingso the produce can reach coastal markets.   The rejected U.S. aid package was to finance the construction ofa training base near the coca-rich Upper Huallaga Valley. It alsoincluded $20 million to build a training camp and provide weaponsand equipment for Peruvian soldiers.   The Upper Huallaga is the world's main supplier of coca leaf,the raw material for cocaine. More than 1,000 Shining Pathguerrillas are estimated to operate in the valley, a jungle region250 miles northeast of Lima.   Many Peruvian politicians had expressed fear that the aidpackage could lead to direct U.S. participation in a guerrilla warthat has claimed nearly 20,000 lives.   The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration already operates ananti-drug base in the Huallaga Valley with Peruvian police. TheShining Path attacked the base in April and engaged U.S. pilots ina shootout. No casualties were reported.   On Wednesday, U.S. Ambassador Anthony Quaynton did sign twoagreements for $400,000 with the interior minister, Gen. AdolfoAlvarado.   The agreements will provide vehicles and motorcycles for thepolice to help combat drug trafficking and they appear to representthe continuation of U.S. anti-drug aid to the police.   However, Washington has as yet been unable to get the armyinvolved in the drug war, and through it, assume an increased rolein the guerrilla war.   The larger aid package would have involved the army, which ismore worried about defeating the Shining Path than with controllingPeru's annual $1 billion cocaine trade.   The military was interested in the aid to fight guerrillas butdid not wish to tie it to the anti-drug fight. It questioned thewording of the proposed agreement, which directly linked any aid tocontrolling the cocaine trade.   Washington's aid package was originally presented to Fujimori'spredecessor, Alan Garcia, who insisted it be accompanied byeconomic aid.   The Bush administration had planned the aid package for the 1990fiscal year, which concludes at the end of September. AmbassadorQuaynton said in an interview with newsmagazine Caretas this weekthat if Peru ``does not sign the agreement, the aid would go toother countries.''   Fujimori, who was sworn in on July 28, inherited a moribundeconomy and a massive government deficit generated by thefree-spending government of Garcia.   He has called off plans to travel to the United States at theend of September for talks with U.N. Secretary General Javier Perezde Cuellar, according to the state news agency Andina.   Fujimori said his ``presence is important at this time, whilethe economic stabilization program is in full flow.''   Andina had previously quoted Quaynton as hinting that Fujimorimight also meet with President Bush.</TEXT></DOC>
