Fraser, as part of an agreement with dissident shareholders.    The appointments increase the size of the board to 14 members from 11. The new directors, besides Mr. Fraser, are J. Montieth Estes, 45, and James Geater, 55, both of Rochester, N.Y. Energy Conversion makes solar cells and other products.    The appointments were part of a settlement reached in February between the struggling technology concern and dissident holders led by Rochester investor William Manning, who opposed the company's plan to authorize additional shares. Energy Conversion hasn't shown an annual profit in 25 years as a public company.    Stanford R. Ovshinsky, president and chief executive officer, said in a telephone interview that he and Mr. Fraser are longtime associates who share concerns about the environment and developing new energy sources. &quot;My primary thought isn't whether (the company) is profitable,&quot; Mr. Fraser said, adding that he is interested in products that have potential for developing alternative sources of energy.    None of the new board members are allied with the dissident faction, which owns 6.8% of the company's common stock.    Under the settlement, the Manning group is forbidden from intervening in the company's affairs, and Mr. Ovshinsky may ask the court to dismiss the new board members if the dissident group liquidates its holdings in Energy Conversion. However, Mr. Ovshinsky said, &quot;We aren't entering this with the idea that we're going to get rid of any of the directors.&quot;    Mr. Ovshinsky said the company has signed several business agreements in recent months that are expected to generate $17.1 million in revenue. The company also is in &quot;very serious negotiations&quot; concerning the sale of its Ovonic Imaging Systems Inc. unit, officials said.    Energy Conversion reported a net loss of $31.3 million for its fiscal year ended June 30, on revenue of $10.2 million. The results included a charge of $5.3 million to settle litigation. </TEXT></DOC>
