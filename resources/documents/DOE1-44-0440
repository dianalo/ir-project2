In eachcase, the average of the potential parallel to the surface is reproducedwell by a simple model barrier with three adjustable parameters, withrelatively small variations between different metals and surfaces. FLAPWcalculations have also been used to examine the effects of chemisorptionon the surface barrier. The results of this work provide a basis forthe analysis of low-energy-electron-diffraction fine-structure and inverse-photoemissionspectra.</TEXT></DOC>
