In the North Bay, city and county officialswant nothing to do with it. In the South Bay, some small-city officials wantto avoid it, while those from San Jose and county government are arguing aboutwho's going to control it.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Editorial  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  REGIONAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROGRESSED ENOUGH THAT ATLEAST ELECTED OFFICIALS ARE ARGUING ABOUT ITONE BIG, UNHAPPY FAMILY  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Commentary; Rob Elder is editor of the Mercury News.  </MEMO><TEXT>     As she and others maneuvered last week over how many representatives eachwould have on a proposed regional commission, San Jose Mayor Susan Hammer wasmoved to exclaim, &quot;Why in hell should Rod (Diridon) and his conveners group goaround telling cities and counties what to do?&quot;;   Her reference was to aSanta Clara County supervisor and to other city and county elected officialsfrom around the region who call themselves the conveners of the regionalgovernment movement. They've argued that city and county governments shouldevenly divide the seats on the new body, with one bonus appointment to eachbig city mayor.;   Hammer argues that in Santa Clara County, San Jose andother cities have sufficient population to justify more votes. Diridoncounters that because the county runs the public transit system, it deservessome of the votes Hammer wants.;   Throughout the region, individuals andorganizations disagree about how to settle the dispute. The board of theAssociation of Bay Area Governments (ABAG) would impose Diridon's 50-50city-county split on all nine counties in the region. But another key group,the Bay Vision Action Coalition (BVAC), in effect has taken Hammer's view thatthis should be fought out separately within each county.;   &quot;We're likely tocome up with a system that lets each jurisdiction decide. Maybe we'll need amediator,&quot; says Angelo Siracusa, a founder of BVAC and president of the BayArea Council, which represents regional big business.;   EnvironmentalistLarry Orman, director of the Greenbelt Alliance and another major advocate ofregional government, describes the representation struggle as &quot;a snake pit,&quot;but agrees that politicians will have to slug it out among themselves.;   Topeople who believe or hope that regional government will become a reality, theissue of who will run it is no academic question. This is about power.;  Under most formulas, one-third of the seats on the original regional bodywould go to members of the public, appointed by public officials. Buttwo-thirds would go to politicians now holding city or county elected office.This formula would apply to an interim commission which would hold office onlyuntil a regional plan was written. It remains to be decided whether apermanent regional government would be elected, appointed, or both.;   Butelected or appointed, it is clear that the same folks who run city and countygovernment now will make a strong bid to control any new regional body,especially since some will have to leave their present offices because of termlimits. Diridon, for example, is seen by some insiders as a candidate to chairthe regional commission, if it ever comes about.;   It won't, if officials inthe North Bay have their way. City council members, mayors and countysupervisors from Napa, Solano and Sonoma counties recently attended a meetingcalled by Diridon's conveners group to promote regional government. &quot;But mostof these people just said, 'How do we get out of this? It's a bad idea,' &quot;says one who attended. &quot;Some thought it was a South Bay plot, to force theconstruction of housing here.&quot;;   One goal of BV 2020 is to spur more housingconstruction throughout the region, but new housing in the North Bay is farmore likely to serve people employed in San Francisco than in Silicon Valley.;  Still, the vast gap between North and South Bay notions about regionalgovernment points up what may be the plan's most serious flaw: There's nocohesive, clearly identified region.;   The plan is designed to serve thetraditionally defined Bay Area -- the nine counties bordering San FranciscoBay (see map). For purposes of cleaning up the Bay or the air basin, this maymake sense. But increasingly, people involved in this effort are concludingthat for transportation, urban growth and economic purposes, the area is notone region but two -- one with San Francisco as its hub, another with SanJose.;   Asked last week whether San Jose needs to be in the same region withSonoma, Solano and Napa counties, Mayor Hammer responded with a question ofher own: &quot;What in God's name do we have in common with them?&quot; And evenSiracusa, who as head of the San Francisco-based Bay Area Council has arguedfor a single, nine-county region, last week conceded that in the threenorthernmost counties, &quot;instead of fighting for seats they're saying we wantno part of it.&quot;;   At a bare minimum, the regional plan proposes to mergethree existing agencies serving the nine-county area -- the Bay Area AirQuality Management District, the Metropolitan Transportation Commission, andABAG, which makes regional housing plans but has little ability to enforcethem.;   If a consensus is forming on anything, it is that the three should bemerged and directed by the proposed regional commission. But while mostparticipants are content for the merged agency to exercise no new powers inthe first three years, the Greenbelt Alliance argues that the interim periodcould last up to seven years, and that this would allow cities to annex anddevelop inappropriate areas before regional planning takes effect. &quot;There willbe huge annexations,&quot; says the GBA's Orman. &quot;By the time the region getsaround to adopting a plan, the horse will be out of the barn.&quot;;   When theregional agency should begin to exercise land-use powers is not the onlyquestion. There's also widespread disagreement about whether it should beempowered only to stop unwanted development, or also to force developmentdeemed good for the region -- housing, for example -- in a given city orcounty.;   Some small-city officials maintain that the regional body should beonly advisory. In a meeting of the local cities association last week,officials from Gilroy, Morgan Hill, Santa Clara, Milpitas, Saratoga and LosAltos Hills seemed particularly upset about sharing their authority over howland will or won't be developed.;   Even the bare bones regional proposal, thethree-agency merger, is questioned by MTC, one of the bodies involved. MTC isimportant because its plans determine the allocation of state and federalfunds for road-building and public transit. A committee of its board isexpected to take a definitive position this week.;   And so there iscontroversy at every turn, but at least people are talking about regionalgovernment, and in Santa Clara County, they're actually getting worked upabout it. All of which leaves the plan's principal promoters with a sort ofbittersweet, qualified optimism.;   &quot;There's a lot of opposition, but it's notfatal,&quot; says Orman of the Greenbelt Alliance.;   &quot;I'd say we have less than a50-50 chance,&quot; says the business council's Siracusa. &quot;But it's a better chancethan we've ever had before.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Rob Elder column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910922  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  September  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  MAP  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  1,209  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday, September 22, 199100266031,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  0  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
