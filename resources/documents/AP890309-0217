It's tough being an author thesedays, especially if one's work reflects political or religiousbeliefs.   It seems that writers are under siege throughout the world:Novelist Salman Rushdie hides in London faced with a death threat;Czech playwright Vaclav Havel sits in a Prague jail for hisleadership in a dissident movement; and Nobel Prize-winner WoleSoyinka's life is threatened in Nigeria.   But while these authors have received worldwide attention, theyrepresent just a fraction of the writers who have recently beenjailed or harassed. The ``Writers in Prison'' committee of theLondon-based P.E.N. International, lists 238 cases of writerscurrently imprisoned, detained or forced into internal exile.   Iranian leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini has called for thedeath of Rushdie, a 41-year-old Bombay native of Islamic parents,because of his novel, ``The Satanic Verses,'' which offers ascathing portrayal of the prophet Mohammed and the founding of theIslamic religion, and has been banned in several countries. Khomeinisaid that anyone performing the act will be granted passage toheaven.   ``The Rushdie thing is certainly unprecedented,'' said authorSusan Sontag, president of the P.E.N. American Center, a majorexponent of writers' freedom. ``Even when the Nazis burned books,there was no call for the death of the writers.''   But the threat to Rushdie has now drawn in Soyinka, a novelistand poet awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1986. Soyinka'soutspoken defense of Rushdie and condemnation of Khomeini as a``sick and dangerous man'' have infuriated Nigerian Moslems, who areestimated to constitute nearly half of the country's population of100 million.   Moslems marched in the city of Lagos, some carrying placards thatread ``Wole Soyinka Must Die,'' and handed a letter of protestagainst Rushdie to the British consul. In the late 1960s, Soyinkawas jailed during the civil war in Nigeria for attempting tonegotiate with the Ibo rebels.   Havel, one of Czechoslovakia's most prominent playwrights andwhose works are banned there, was jailed for nine months in lateFebruary for allegedly inciting a protest in January to commemoratethe death in 1968 of Jan Palach, a student who set fire to himselfin protest of the Soviet-led invasion.   He was sentenced to four years in 1979 for sedition and has beenconsistently harassed by government officials for his efforts toform a political opposition.   Also in Czechoslovakia, Ivan Jirous, an editor and publisher, hasbeen jailed four times since 1976 for anti-government activities.His most recent arrest came in October 1988 for his role inorganizing an open letter to protest the death of a prisoner ofconscience, Pavel Wonka, while he was being held in detention.   Jirous, who faces a prison term of up to five years, is chargedunder the Czech penal code with ``assaulting state officials andofficials of a public organization'' and ``damaging the interests ofthe state abroad.'' His trial began March 9.   A more unusual case of a writer having trouble with theauthorities involves Joseph Wambaugh, author of such best sellers as``The Onion Field'' and ``The New Centurions.''   Wambaugh, a former Los Angeles police officer, based his newbook, ``The Blooding,'' on the rape and murder of two 15-year oldgirls in Leicester, England. The killer was eventually tracked downthrough the process of genetic fingerprinting, which means that anindividual's blood or semen has a distinctive genetic code such as afingerprint.   Wambaugh conducted extensive interviews with police and thevictims' families and ``The Blooding'' gives a detailed account ofthe case. But Leicester police, responding to protests against theauthor's description of the crimes, have launched an investigationinto how information was obtained for the book. The police furthersaid the closely detailed descriptions of the rapes and murderscaused distress to the families involved.   In South Africa, among the many people in jail for theiropposition to apartheid _ the government's policy of racialseparation and discrimination _ is Jaki Seroke, the editorialdirector of Skotaville Publishers, a non-profit organization thatconcentrates on the works of black writers.   In September 1987, Seroke was arrested and confined under Section29 of the Internal Security Act, which allows ``indefiniteincommunicado detention without charge or trial for the purposes ofsecurity police interrogation.''   He was eventually charged with ``possession of bannedliterature'' and ``furthering the aims of a banned organization''and recently was sentenced to 10 years in jail. Seroke is believedto be at a police station in Soweto.   Although released from prison in December 1988, Zwelakhe Sisulu,who has written for several newspapers, is confined evenings to hishome in Johannesburg and is required to report twice a day toauthorities.   He was first arrested in 1986 for ``anti-government activities,''rearrested later that year and also confined under Section 29.Officials later admitted that his detention was based on hisinvolvement with ``The New Nation,'' an anti-apartheid newspaperwhich Sisulu founded.   Ironically, these various arrests come at a time when otherwriters have managed to win increased freedom in such countries asthe Soviet Union and South Korea that had long stifled artisticexpression.   According to the ``Writers in Prison'' committee, under Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev's policy of liberalization or``perestroika,'' the number of jailed writers and journalists in theSoviet Union had dropped from 93 in 1983 to 20 in 1988. Improvementsin the treatment of writers were also noted in Chile and Argentina.   South Korea released 281 political prisoners last Dec. 21 as partof an overall amnesty program. Journalist Kim Hyon-jang and poet KimNam-ju were among those granted freedom, although Hyon-jang hassince been rearrested for holding a sit-in to protest the continueddetention of other political prisoners   Czechoslovakia has also loosened some restrictions, returning thenovels of Franz Kafka to the stores of his home country for thefirst time since 1968 and allowing the films of director MilosForman (``Amadeus,'' ``Hair'') to be shown in theaters.   ``The positive side is what's going on in the Soviet empire whichis, with some notable exceptions such as Romania, improvingvastly,'' Sontag said. ``The other positive thing is never hasconsciousness been so alerted to the problem. There really is muchmore awareness and greater ability to publicize these cases andexert pressure on governments.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 12</NOTE></DOC>
