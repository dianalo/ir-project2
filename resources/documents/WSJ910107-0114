In &quot;steam explosion&quot; systems, waste paper is put underhigh pressure in a chamber. Then the paper is suddenlyreleased from pressure, causing an explosion that makes iteasier to process cellulose and other paper constituents intopulp for new paper.   The technology has been used since the 1970s by StakeTech,Toronto, to process wood chips, straw and other &quot;biomass&quot;materials into virgin paper and livestock feed, among otherthings. Now StakeTech and Chesapeake Corp., a Richmond, Va.,paper maker, have formed a $2.5 million venture to market itfor paper recycling. The venture, Recoupe RecyclingTechnologies, plans to sell the systems to papermanufacturers and to states and counties with mountinglandfill problems, says James D. Nagy, Recoupe's president.   The technology produces more uniform pulp than alternativeprocesses, doesn't require prior removal of ink from wastepaper and can handle hard-to-recycle paper, such aswater-resistant kinds, says Jeremy Kendall, StakeTech'spresident. It also cuts costly production steps and saveswater and energy, he says.   A typical version of the system would cost about $40million, compared with $65 million or so for a conventionalalternative, says Mr. Nagy. It would produce tissue paper, alikely application, for about $203 a ton, compared with $322a ton for processes now widely used, he adds. And Recoupe'ssystems can be set up in six to eight months, compared withtwo years or more for competing technologies, he says.   Richard Schrader, a recycling expert at the Center forPolicy Alternatives in Washington, says states might buy thenew systems to speed development of the used-paper market.Gregg Fales, editor of the Fiber andamp; Board Report, a newsletterin Oradell, N.J., adds that the systems may be especiallygood for mixed office waste paper, for which recycling demandis expected to burgeon as more businesses establishcollection systems.                                                                                                          `Green' Bazaars Thrive   During a Gray Holiday                                                                                                          DEFYING the recession, stores specializing inenvironmentally oriented wares are opening nationwide.   &quot;We've far exceeded our business plan in our first fiveweeks,&quot; says Leslie Barclay, owner of How on Earth, one ofthe new stores in Santa Fe, N.M. &quot;We've already had 10 peoplewanting to do franchises with us.&quot; Despite being open only ashort time, she adds, the store had strong Christmas sales.Popular gift items included candy made with Amazonrain-forest nuts, dolphin puzzles and T-shirts withecological messages.   At Terra Verde Trading Co., which opened a month ago inNew York's Soho district, composters quickly sold out. Itemssuch as linens made without toxic bleaches and stationeryfrom recycled paper have moved fast, says owner KatherineTiddens.   Ozone Brothers, launched in 1989 in Rochester, N.Y.,claims to be the first of the new specialty retailers.Business has boomed all year, says co-founder Jim Aroneseno,and Christmas sales &quot;far exceeded&quot; expectations. &quot;Quirky&quot;purchases spurred holiday sales, he adds, such as &quot;Holy Cow,&quot;odorless plant food made from liquified cow manure.                                                                                                          Solar Cells That Hum   After the Sun's Gone                                                                                                          WITHIN a few years, solar cells may be available that workin the dark.   The photoelectrochemical cells resemble a cross betweenthe familiar solid-state solar cells that convert light toelectricity and old-fashioned, wet-cell batteries. Theycombine semiconductors, which make electricity when hit bylight rays, with electrodes bathed in electrolytes, whichenable the cells to be charged up like car batteries.   In bright light, the cells both make electricity andrecharge. In low-light conditions, their stored energy can betapped. The combination promises a leap forward fornonpolluting solar power, which has been hindered by itsintermittent nature.   Researchers have faced formidable problems making PECcells practical, though. Their semiconductors have tended tocorrode quickly. And the cells' efficiencies -- theproportion of light energy converted to the electrical kind-- have been relatively low compared with solid-statealternatives, which have reached 25% efficiency in laboratorytests.   Recently, a team led by chemist Stuart Licht at ClarkUniversity in Worcester, Mass., has made steady progress inovercoming the problems. By fine-tuning levels of electrolyteconstituents, the team has achieved efficiencies of about 17%in PEC cells that work for weeks. &quot;The exciting thing now,&quot;says Mr. Licht, &quot;is that there are theoretical indicationsliquid solar cells can access more of the sun's energy thansolid-state cells can.&quot;   Several companies have expressed interest in thetechnology, which may lead to commercial cells in a fewyears, he adds.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE NEW Consumer Institute, Vernon Hills, Ill., haslaunched a newsletter, the Conscious Consumer, aimed athelping consumers assess environmental claims made forvarious products. The institute also has a corporate editionto help companies evaluate their own &quot;green&quot; advertisingcampaigns, says editor John F. Wasik. . . . Some 1,300substances can cause indoor air pollution, according toexperts at a recent Yale University conference on&quot;sick-building syndrome.&quot; One researcher added that as manyas 300 such compounds have been detected in one room of asick building.</TEXT></DOC>
