The official Iraqi News Agency said Iraq fired three missilesinto Tehran, a city of 6 million.   Iran's Islamic Republic News Agency said Revolutionary Guardsfired five missiles at ``military centers'' in Baghdad inretaliation for ``these inhuman acts,'' and hit the northern cityof Mosul with a missile for the first time.   Both sides reported their border towns pounded by sustainedartillery fire and air raids that killed scores of people.   It was the eighth day of missile exchanges between the PersianGulf neighbors, which have been at war since September 1980.   Iraq confirmed that two missiles fell on residential sections ofBaghdad, whose population is 5 million, killing or wounding ``manycivilians, including women and children.''   It said a missile hit a residential district of Mosul, killingor wounding civilians and damaging several houses, shops and cars.Mosul also was reported bombed.   IRNA, the Iranian agency, said 30 civilians were killed and morethan 100 wounded in Tehran, most of them women and children. Itsaid one missile demolished a clinic, a school and several homes.   Iraq says it has fired 41 missiles into the Iranian capitalsince the exchanges began Feb. 29. The Iranians have reportedfiring 23 missiles on Baghdad in that period, but the haveacknowledged only 18 hits.   In Baghdad, Labor Minister Baker Mahmoud Rasoul said Iran beganthe latest round in the ``war of the cities to pave the way for itsnew (ground) offensive.''   Vice President Taha Muhieddin Maarouf, also addressing thegathering of Arab labor ministers, said ``Our armed forces arefully ready to rout any Iranian offensive.''   They apparently referred to threats Saturday by HashemiRafsanjani, speaker of the Iranian Parliament, to answer the Iraqimissile barrage with action along the 730-mile border war front.
