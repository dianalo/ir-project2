The software developed simplifies the interfacebetween the parallel computer and the applications developer by providinga library of functions in the C programming language. These functionsare used to control image processor programs that run independently inthe parallel computer and perform the image-processing operations. Thecomplexities of the parallel processor are hidden and replaced with aflexible structure specifically designed for image processing. This structureprovides a simplified interface, but also acts as a framework to whichadditional image-processing operations can be added.</TEXT></DOC>
