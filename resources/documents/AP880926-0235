The law ``could lead to greater recourse to unilateral measuresby the United States which would be inconsistent with the Punta delEste declaration and with our common commitment to the multilateraltrading system,'' the 12 EEC foreign ministers said in a statement.   The 1986 declaration in Punta del Este, Uruguay, launched a newround of world trade talks designed to combat protectionism.   The EEC ministers said they will monitor implementation of theU.S. law ``very closely'' and will take ``prompt action'' if EECinterests are threatened.   EEC External Relations Commissioner Willy de Clercq told theministers that the new U.S. trade law, by increasing trade powersfor the U.S. Congress, would ``diminish the scope for discretion bythe administration.''   He said it would ``open the door'' to lobbyists trying toinfluence the U.S. administration to renege on its obligationsunder the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), the set ofregulations governing world trade.   The United States and the EEC are locked in several tradedisputes at the moment.   These include EEC objections to the use of hormones in Americanbeef and U.S. objections to government subsidies for Airbus, theEuropean aircraft consortium.   The ministers also repeated their objections to another U.S.trade initiative, a bill offering protection to manufacturers oftextiles, clothing and footwear.   ``Such a development would seriously affect trade in this sectorand jeopardize the Uruguay round negotiations,'' the EEC ministerssaid in their statement.   The bill would limit increases in textile and apparel imports to1 percent a year over their 1987 levels and freeze non-rubber shoeimports at their 1987 level.   Both the U.S. House and the Senate have passed the bill, but bymajorities insufficient to override a promised veto by PresidentReagan. He has 10 days to sign it into law or, failing that, vetoit.</TEXT></DOC>
