His face was swollen, his body still, strangled inthe first hours of life and dumped by three people who sped off ina late-model Chevy Nova.   ``It's such a waste of life,'' said Gardena police DetectiveBill Moreno, who is trying to trace the mother by a serial numberon the video-game box into which the infant was stuffed. ``Whowould do something like that?''   The mother who abandons her child is often unwed, perhaps haslost a job, is addicted to drugs or has mental or physicalproblems, experts say. ``Baby blues'' _ postpartum depression _also can play a part.   ``I was isolated. I felt very alone. I didn't feel there wasanybody out there in the world that could possibly understand whatI was going through,'' explained Gayle Marcuerquiaga, who left anewborn girl in a neighbor's trash.   An estimated 20,860 children were abandoned in 1986 in theUnited States, ranging from babies dumped in the trash to toddlersleft in foster homes and not reclaimed, according to the AmericanHumane Association.   ``This is just the tip of the iceberg because nobody keeps anyhard figures,'' said AHA spokeswoman Katie Bond. It's hard to tellif abandonment is increasing, she said, because it represents only1 percent of child abuse and neglect _ and those reports haveclimbed 212 percent since 1976.   But Alex Morales of the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles, aprivate, non-profit agency which places some forsaken babies infoster homes, said, ``There is an increase and a change in theflavor of what's behind it. It seems to be very related tosubstance abuse problems that the adults are having.''   ``It's an act of desperation,'' said Thomas Hicklin, assistantprofessor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at University ofSouthern California.   Mrs. Marcuerquiaga, 28, who is appealing her attempted murderconviction and three-year prison term, calls her Sparks, Nev.,family typically American. She was a young mother juggling work,family, children, and financial ruin.   She believes abandoning her baby last April culminated a seriesof events that included her father's death and a back injury thatput her husband Jim out of work. Her job as a manicurist didn'tbring in enough to support their sons, ages 8{ and 4. The coupleseparated for six months, and she got pregnant during a one-nightstand. Yet she refused to believe she was pregnant until the childwas born as she sat over the toilet, and even then the child wasnot real.   ``If it were a child to me, that would not have happened,'' shesaid of the abandonment. The infant was put up for adoption becauseMrs. Marcuerquiaga did not want her to grow up with knowledge ofher first few hours. ``I felt if we brought her home, she wouldhave to live with this, and she deserves better.''   In some cases, children have been left where there is apossibility someone will rescue them, such as doorsteps, churches,hospitals.   A newborn boy was found in March 1988 outside a Mission Viejourgent care center with a bag of diapers, a $20 bill and a notesaying: ``Hi, my name is Brett. Please find me a good home.''   Last November, a woman pinned a note to the yellow sleeper ofher infant son and left him on the steps of a Roman Catholic churchhere. The note, in Spanish, said: ``I have no job. I have no money.I am from El Salvador.''   In January, a newborn boy dressed in a T-shirt and diaper wasleft on the doorstep of a home in the upscale Los Angeles suburb ofSimi Valley. ``We were just thankful that we were home,'' saidValerie Carrillo. ``It was a shock to open up and see something sospecial on the doorstep.''   The Rev. Alberto Villalobos, who answered a bell at the door ofSt. John of God Catholic Church in Norwalk, Calif., in March 1988to find a week-old boy, said the 22-year-old unwed mother wasdriven by fear. ``Nobody knew she was pregnant.''   The baby had been left with the note: ``Please take care of mychild. Give him a good home. I can't, because I don't have one.''   ``From what I know, she was a young person down on her luck whodid what she thought was best for the child,'' sheriff's Sgt.Douglas Dickinson said of the decision not to file charges. Themother was not identified.   An abandoned child becomes a ward of the county or, in someareas, the state. While authorities search for the parents, thechild is put in a foster home, where it might live for up to 1{years before it can legally be adopted.   Psychologists and social workers say most abandoned children whoare permanently adopted into good homes will not suffer any specialproblems. But Hicklin said ``some children think maybe they're toblame or something's wrong with them _ they must not be right orworthy of their mother's love.''   Finding parents willing to love a throwaway child is notdifficult. Most waiting lines are years long for couples who wantto adopt an infant. Each case of abandonment lights up switchboardsnationwide with would-be parents.   ``People are clamoring for babies,'' said Ray LaMotte,spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County Department of Children'sServices. ``They can walk in and hand the baby to us. No one needsto know their name.''   All the newborns abandoned in the Los Angeles area in the lastyear were unclaimed by parents. With older children, motherssometimes do return.   A woman who abandoned her 3-month-old daughter at a Visaliahospital in January, saying she couldn't pay her medical bills,later returned for the baby and was offered help by county mentalhealth workers.   One of the more publicized cases is that of Christina LoCasto,who gave birth to a daughter, Alyssa, July 13 on a United Airlinesjet bound from New York to San Francisco. An airline worker laterfound the child stuffed into a bathroom waste bin, suffering fromhypothermia and cuts on her back.   Mrs. LoCasto, 24, of Staten Island, N.Y., pleaded innocent inJuly to one felony count of child endangerment. Custody of thechild has been given to her paternal grandparents, and Mrs. LoCastoand her husband Louis, who apparently was unaware of the pregnancy,visit six hours weekly under supervision.   Mrs. LoCasto is in therapy while awaiting an April 13preliminary hearing, said her attorney, Richard Bennett. If shechanges her plea to guilty, she will face no more than a year incounty jail.   ``She doesn't want to go to jail,'' said Assistant DistrictAttorney Steve Wagstaff. ``But we're not going to agree to thatuntil we find the answer to the question: Why did she do this?''   Sharon Elliott survived an undetermined amount of time beforebeing found Christmas Eve 1931 along an Arizona desert highway by acouple changing a flat tire. Tucked inside a black pasteboardhatbox, the tiny red-haired waif drew nationwide attention andbecame known as the ``hatbox baby.''   Ms. Elliott, 57, theorizes she was born to an unwed womanfearful of a disapproving society, or perhaps the couple who foundher had known the mother and made up the story of finding the childin the desert.   She is happy to have been adopted, but there is a hard edge inher voice when she considers throwaway kids. ``There's so manyplaces you can take a child. Don't just dump them like a load oftrash.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon AMs, April 3</NOTE></DOC>
