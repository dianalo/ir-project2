Not only will it provide &quot;the finest programming on this planet,&quot; he says, it will do so as part of cable systems' basic offerings rather than as a premium service like Home Box Office and Showtime.    But it may be years before TNT can realize that starry-eyed vision. In the meantime, skeptics say, Mr. Turner's much ballyhooed new cable network is liable to look more like a round-the-clock &quot;Late Show&quot; than a paragon of cable programming.    If all goes according to plan, TNT will premiere Oct. 3 with a showing of &quot;Gone With the Wind&quot; and follow with a steady stream of old movies from Turner Broadcasting System Inc.'s 3,300-title MetroGoldwyn-Mayer library. Over the next three years, Mr. Turner aims to add to this menu a nightly smorgasbord of high-profile miniseries, big-league sports and Academy Awards-type extravaganzas.    The ambitious plan is already generating controversy. Cable executives are sharply divided over whether there is really room for another major cable network -- and whether Turner Broadcasting can deliver it. TNT, which is likely to make its debut in seven million to 10 million households, &quot;will need to move into the 30-to-35 million range quickly to compete and bid effectively for programming,&quot; says Larry Gerbrandt, an analyst at Paul Kagan Associates, a Carmel, Calif., investment concern.    Cable operators have long touted the idea of a network that would produce must-see, high-quality fare for which subscribers wouldn't have to pay extra. John Malone, president of the giant cable operator Tele-Communications Inc. and leader of the group of operators that owns 37% of Turner Broadcasting, contends that the industry needs such &quot;punch-through&quot; programming to compete with slick broadcast-network shows and lure more subscribers. Although about half of U.S. homes now get cable, that proportion must climb much higher to increase ratings and fetch more advertising revenues.    The industry has already invested heavily to launch such niche networks as the Discovery Channel, the Fashion Channel and the Learning Channel, which run much original programming. But executives feel that alongside the three major broadcast networks, cable still has the image of an also-ran. &quot;We need more of the kind of sports programming, major movies and miniseries that heavy TV viewers love,&quot; says John Hendricks, president and chief executive officer of the Discovery Channel. &quot;To do that, cable has to focus its energy, and TNT may be it.&quot;    Mr. Turner, who created both Cable News Network and, in WTBS, the modern, satellite &quot;superstation,&quot; must trade heavily on his reputation in launching TNT. &quot;He might be the only one who would have a chance of doing this,&quot; says Charles F. Dolan, chairman and chief executive officer of Cablevision Systems Corp., a Long Island, N.Y.-based operator.    Paul Isaacson, an executive vice president with the advertising concern Young andamp; Rubicam Inc., agrees. While he questions whether TNT can buy enough time with old movies, he's open to committing his clients to a Turner project. &quot;Turner's got a good track record and the support of the operators,&quot; Mr. Isaacson says. &quot;In a business where the cost of advertising is skyrocketing and the market is fragmenting, it's important to look at these things as future investments.&quot;    However, some in the industry worry that TNT could further fragment the cable audience at a time when such networks as USA, ESPN and Lifetime are finally healthy enough to start spending to upgrade programming. Kay Koplovitz, president of USA Network Inc., sees another network -- especially one like TNT -- as &quot;a barrier to any of us catapulting into a higher level of viewership.&quot; Even the biggest cable networks, including USA, have only a fraction of the total viewing audience. Winning a 2 to 4 share (or percentage of all television sets tuned in) is the best most cable shows can hope for.    Ad spending may be splintered, too. &quot;There's a pool of advertising dollars for cable, but it only goes so far,&quot; notes Marc Goldstein, a senior vice president at the advertising concern Ogilvy Group Inc. &quot;Can all these different entities continue to grow and prosper and generate the type of revenues necessary to provide programming?&quot; (Cable is projected to draw $1.5 billion in advertising in 1988, up from $1.1 billion in 1987, according to Cabletelevision Advertising Bureau Inc.)    Other networks also see TNT as a bludgeon that would keep them from raising prices. Mr. Turner plans to offer TNT free to operators until the end of 1988, then gradually increase fees to 25 cents a month per subscriber by 1991. USA, ESPN and others now charge about 20 cents monthly per subscriber and are eager to raise fees so they can spend more on programming. Such increases would be more difficult were another major network to appear.    Beyond such objections, TNT faces some problems. For one thing, many cable systems, particularly older ones, have a shortage of available channels. There are already more than 60 cable networks of various sizes competing for space on systems that often have only 35 to 40 channels. Many of those networks, such as the Discovery Channel and the Fashion Channel, are partly owned by cable operators, who have an interest in their success.    Moreover, operators are naturally hesitant to remove a popular network in favor of one that's a mere promise. And David MacDonald, president of New York Times Co.'s NYT Cable unit, worries that TNT would drain resources from Turner Broadcasting's own WTBS, which is currently one of his system's two most popular channels. He argues that &quot;anybody would have to say: 'I've got a winner with WTBS; why do anything that would hurt it?'&quot;    Mr. Turner recognizes these obstacles. &quot;We have to convince cable operators that TNT belongs on their system, when in many instances something else has to go,&quot; he says. Still, he thinks they'll be eager for what he promises.    In prime time, Mr. Turner envisions original situation comedies and game shows, as well as dramatic series and miniseries. (Meeting yesterday with dozens of Hollywood production executives, Mr. Turner told them he was interested in programming of an &quot;uplifting nature.&quot;) He'd also like to get some splashy special events, such as the Academy Awards and the Miss America Pageant, as well as some high-minded, high-budget documentaries.    TNT plans to bid on National Football League games and other sports, though Mr. Turner says, &quot;I don't see us as a head-to-head competitor in any way with ESPN.&quot; Nevertheless, all-sports ESPN, which currently has the rights to a Sunday-night NFL package, &quot;is prepared for TNT,&quot; says J. William Grimes, president and chief executive officer of the network, which is 80% owned by Capital Cities/ABC Inc. &quot;We aren't going to sit by idly while TNT takes over.&quot;    Others may be equally prepared. Mr. Turner himself concedes that many of the 40 to 50 special-event extravaganzas on its wish list &quot;have long-standing relationships with the networks. Some of them will be virtually impossible to get.&quot; TNT could commit to a big miniseries today, but it would take at least two years and several million dollars to produce. Two years is also the soonest it could get pro football and baseball on the air.    As even Mr. Turner acknowledges, &quot;It's not going to be easy.&quot;    ---                   Largest Cable Networks    Advertiser supported                                              Subscribers    Network               Owner             (In Millions)    ESPN                  Capital Cities/                          ABC                        46.1    Cable News            Turner    Network               Broadcasting               42.5    USA                   Gulf andamp;    Network               Western/MCA                41.0 -    MTV                   Viacom                     39.4    Nickelodeon           Viacom                     37.9    CBN Cable             Christian    Network               Broadcasting               37.2    Nashville             Opryland USA/    Network               Gaylord                    37.0    Lifetime              Hearst/                          Viacom/ABC                 35.4    C-Span                Nonprofit                          Cooperative                33.0    The Weather           Landmark    Channel               Communications             31.6    Source: Cablevision magazine</TEXT></DOC>
