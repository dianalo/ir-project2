The larger of the two measures allocates $42.6 billion toPentagon accounts related to the crisis, while the second,$4.46 billion bill is a composite of military, foreign aid,and domestic expenditures to supplement appropriations forfiscal 1991.</LP><TEXT>   Foreign donations will ultimately play a part in financingboth measures, although the Israel aid package will take theform of cash grants directly from the Treasury. PresidentBush backed yesterday's action, but the agreement came onlyafter days of sometimes tense negotiations in which Secretaryof State James Baker effectively bargained with both theIsraeli government and the pro-Israel lobby in Washington.   Within the administration, Budget Director Richard Darmansought to blunt the pressure for added funds, and Israelsurprised some officials Monday by balking at Mr. Baker'soffer of a $500 million cash package. By the same token, thesecretary used the talks to pursue his own agenda, as hepared back Israel's initial $1 billion request and alsostalled future legislation authorizing new U.S. loanguarantees for the Mideast nation.   Israel is expected to still seek credit to finance housingand employment programs, but the compromise would essentiallytether the pro-Israel lobby from pursuing these funds untilLabor Day or the last month of the current fiscal year.   The sensitivity of the talks is owed to the secretary'sMideast trip this week and Republican politics closer tohome. The victory over Iraq has enhanced Washington'sstanding with Arab allies in the region, and theadministration wants to avoid the impression that the U.S. isreturning to what one official described as a &quot;business asusual&quot; posture of financing Israel.   At the same time, Mr. Baker's own political party hopes tocapitalize on the chill between pro-Israel supporters andDemocratic allies who opposed the January war resolution.Some of the most fiscally conservative Republicans in theSenate joined in the bidding, for fear of losing ground backto Democrats who have thrown their support to new aid.   Left unresolved is how the U.S. will dispose of fourPatriot missile batteries deployed to Israel during the war,but it is expected that at least some of these may be turnedover to the Israeli government. Under provisions previouslyapproved by Congress, Israel may draw on hundreds of millionsof dollars in U.S. military stocks. And as much as $288million in munition stockpiles and equipment has already beenmade available since August, according to State Departmentestimates.   Though the foreign aid package has received the mostattention, the underlying spending bills are a magnet forspecial interests at home seeking money and a legislativevehicle to advance their own proposals. Fearful of futurecutbacks, defense contractors fought for a share of theMideast funds, and union lobbyists inserted a provisionblocking new Labor Department rules affecting apprenticeshipprograms and weakening wage protections for semi-skilled&quot;helpers&quot; under the Davis Bacon Act.   Among the major domestic appropriations is $1.5 billionfor the food-stamp program and $200 million -- or double theadministration's request -- for unemployment insurance. Thenew city administration in the District of Columbia secured$100 million in additional federal aid, and another $55million is divided between a new national infant mortalityprogram and Bureau of Land Management initiatives to assistwildlife in drought-striken California.   About $151 million, including law enforcement, VeteransAdministration and U.S Information Agency accounts, would bedubbed &quot;emergency expenditures&quot; related to the war. Thisclassification exempts the money from budget ceilings set inlast October's deficit-reduction agreement, and much the samerationale will be used to justify the new Israel funds.   Even more discretion is allowed for Pentagon costs, andthe committee bill exceeds the administration in severalcases and only vaguely defines how $6.3 billion related tothe war itself will be spent. Procurement funds are at least$333.6 million over the Pentagon's revised request of $2.9billion, for example, and $470 million is added to operationsand maintenance accounts.   Raytheon Co., which has a major ally in Rules CommitteeChairman Joseph Moakley, was among the chief beneficiaries.And by a 37-12 margin, the Appropriations panel approvedlanguage sought by Grumman Corp. to force the Pentagon toobligate $987.9 million for work on the Navy F-14 fighter.The influential Pennsylvania delegation added language tobenefit munitions producers and the Philadelphia shipyard inthat state, and the panel approved a $237 million transfer tohelp finance reported cost overruns on a National Steel andamp;Shipbuilding Co. contract in San Diego.   Foreign contributions to help cover the cost of the warare expected to exceed $50 billion, but current Pentagonestimates list only $14.2 billion in cash on hand fromallies. Language demanding that all donations be made byApril 15 was rejected 24-17, and the legislation appropriates$15 billion as a bridge loan, or down payment of sorts tocarry the military until the money is collected.</TEXT></DOC>
