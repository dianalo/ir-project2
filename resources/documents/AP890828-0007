The war between the Marxistgovernment and the U.S.-backedguerrillas is reflected in almost every turn.   A recent trip along a section of the road showed that guerrillashaven't yet carried out their pledge to cut the strategic linkbetween the Soviet Union and the Afghan capital.   Heavily laden trucks of every vintage were rumbling south fromHairatan, just across the Oxus River from the Soviet Union, carryingammunition, fuel, wheat and other goods to Kabul.   Vehicles loaded with food, supplies and even a yellow-and-whiteKabul taxi were heading north on the 260-mile journey back to theSoviet border.   Every day, almost 800 trucks travel along the Salang in bothdirections and sometimes as many as 1,000, said Col. Barakat Ullah,deputy regional commander south of the Salang pass.   He said guerrillas tried unsuccessfully to cut the Salang afterthe last Soviet troops rolled up the highway on Feb. 15, endingtheir near decade-long involvement in the war.   But for the last five months, there has been only sporadicshelling around this post, which is 16 miles south of the SalangTunnel and about 60 miles north of Kabul, he said.   During the trip, there were no sounds of hostile gunfire in thisstrategically important area overlooking the Hindu Kush Mountains,which is heavily infiltrated with guerrillas.   A vanload of local Afghans provided the only real noise, firingtheir rifles into the air in a traditional welcome for thejournalists as they rode on top of three armored personnel carriersthrough the town of Jabalassaraj, about 50 miles north of Kabul.   Barakat said the guerrillas were feuding among themselves andwere too weak to attack. The government has made deals with mostlocal guerrilla commanders not to attack the convoys and in the pasttwo months, 600 guerrillas in the area have switched their supportto the government, he said.   Professor Burhanuddin Rabbani, head of the fundamentalistJamiat-E-Islami guerrilla group, said late last month thatPakistan-based rebels were trying to develop a coordinated strategyto cut all major roads in Afghanistan.   Right now, the Salang, the most hotly contested road of the war,is the only major highway operating with a semblance of normalcy.   The two other major roads out of Kabul have more seriousproblems: The Jalalabad road running southeast from Kabul to thePakistani border is open, but mainly to military traffic and alimited amount of civilian vehicles which travel under militaryescort.   The Logar and Ghazni roads running south to Pakistan have beenclosed for more than a month, cutting off supplies of wheat andproduce to the open market in Kabul and sending prices soaring.   The guerrillas, who call themselves mujahedeen or Islamic HolyWarriors, said they want even higher prices to force Kabul residentsto evacuate so they can attack the city.   But as long as the Salang stays open, a total blockade isimpossible.   In the past three weeks, the government's stockpile of wheat inthe Kabul silo has grown from 8,000 metric tons to 27,000 metrictons, well-informed sources said.   Most was shipped down the Salang by truck from Hairatan, but somewas flown to Kabul by Soviet transport planes, which arrive on anaverage of about 30 per day. The wheat is crucial to avoiding arepetition of last winter's shortages.   Even though the military appeared relatively confident, soldiersalong the highway were reinforcing posts and building new securityareas where sheep once roamed and wild grass grew.   Dozens of tanks were poised to fire and soldiers stood oncommanding hilltop positions along the mountainous road whichBarakat said the government established after the Soviet withdrawal.   During the war, dozens of once thriving hillside villages werecaught in crossfire. In the final stages of the Soviet withdrawal,they were finally reduced to rubble in a combined Afghan-Sovietsweep to ensure that guerrillas would not use them to fire on thedeparting convoys.   Like the blackened of tankers and trucks littering the sides ofthe road and the banks of the Salang River running alongside, theyare reminders that the scars of war will last long after thefighting ends.</TEXT></DOC>
