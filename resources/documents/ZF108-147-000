 During this time, SNA corporate network environments havequickly shifted from a centralized, single-host, single-vendor environment toa decentralized, multiprocessor, multivendor data processing environment [30,34].andP;  The increased importance of distributed communications through thedevelopment of generalized protocol standards has led IBM to retool itsfuture plans for SNA [6, 33].andM;SNA has met some of its user needs with the advent of Systems ApplicationsArchitecture (SAA), but SNA's future may hinge on its ability to conformproducts to the Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model (OSI)specifications [35].andP;  The rise of the OSI model in international markets andnow in the United States is proof that users are driving vendors (such asIBM) to offer connectivity solutions.andP;  IBM, initially slow in responding tothe OSI model, is now making the adjustments and product announcements thatnetwork integrators and managers have been waiting for [4].andM;This article will examine the areas where SNA and OSI connectivity have andwill possibly occur.andP;  The first part of the article will discuss the conceptand components of both SNA and OSI.andP;  The second part will explain commoninterconnection devices such as:andM;(1) repeatersandM;(2) bridgesandM;(3) routersandM;(4) broutersandM;(5) gatewaysandM;(6) device emulationandM;(7) internet transmission (X.25 packet-switching), andandM;(8) interstation transmission.andM;The third part will discuss the major characteristics, pros andamp; cons, and somespecialized equipment necessary for three SNA/OSI integration techniques,direct (SNA-OSI), indirect (SNA-non-SNA-OSI), and mixed (portions of directand indirect).andP;  The fourth part will discuss the success of the threeintegration techniques in both local area network (LAN) and wide area network(WAN) environments, in relation to cost, transmission speeds, flexibility,and connectivity features.andP;  The fifth part will discuss current,OSI-complaint IBM product announcements and assess possible areas for futureSNA/OSI connectivity.andM;SNA AND OSIandM;SNAandM;Systems network Architecture entered the market in 1974 as a hierarchical,single-host network structure [28].andP;  Since then, SNA has developed steadilyin two directions.andP;  The first direction involved tying together mainframesand unintelligent terminals in a master-to-slave relationship [34].andP;  Thesecond direction transformed the SNA architecture to support acooperative-processing environment, whereby remote terminals link up withmainframes as well as each other in a peer-to-peer relationship (termed LowEntry Networking (LEN) by IBM) [21].andP;  LEN depends on the implementation oftwo protocols: Logical Unit 6.2, also known as APPC, and Physical Unit 2.1which affords point-to-point connectivity between peer nodes withoutrequiring host computer control [21].andM;The SNA model is concerned with both logical and physical units.andP;  Logicalunits (LUs) serve as points of access by which users can utilize the network.andO;LUs can be viewed as terminals that provide users access to applicationprograms and other services on the network [23].andP;  Physical units (PUs) likeLUs are not defined within SNA architecture, but instead, are representationsof the devices and communication links of the network [23].andP;  Physical unitsare comprised of four main hardware types:andM;* terminal devicesandM;* cluster controllersandM;* Front-End Processors (FEP), andandM;* host computer(s).andM;Terminal devices and cluster controllers generally are considered peripheralnodes in an SNA network.andP;  A peripheral node directly communicates with thesubarea node to which it is attached [23].andP;  Therefore, peripheral nodes mustcommunicate and exchange data through the subarea node if they wish to speakwith one another.andP;  Peripheral nodes are found in a variety of IBM systemsincluding the 3270 family, the 5250 workstation, and the 3730 distributedoffice systems [23].andM;FEPs and host computers are generally considered two different types ofsubarea nodes.andP;  Subarea nodes can communicate with their own peripheralnodes, as well as with other subarea nodes in the network [23].andP;  Hostcomputers (also known as type 5 nodes) are generally found within generalpurposes systems, such as IBM 30XX, 4300, System/36 or 38 [23].andP;  FEPs (alsoknown as type 4 nodes) are generally communications controllers such as anIBM 3705, 3725, or 3745 [23].andP;  Figure 1 shows the various nodes of an SNAnetwork.andM;The SNA model is composed of seven architectural layers.andP;  The lowest layer,the physical control layer, addresses the transmission of bit streams over aphysical connection or circuit [20, 23].andP;  The next layer, the data linkcontrol layer, is responsible for the transmission of data between two ormore network components (nodes) via specific physical linkages.andP;  The datalink control layer detects errors that occur in data transmission and mapsout a recovery strategy for the network [20, 23].andM;The third layer is the path control layer which is concerned with the routingof data through the network [23].andP;  The fourth layer is the transmissioncontrol layer, which monitors the status of factors associated with currentsession messages such as data flow, exchange, sequence, size, andencryption/decryption [31].andP;  The fifth layer is termed the data flow controllayer and is concerned with the collective integrity of the data flow duringa session [23].andP;  The data flow control layer correlates data exchange andsynchronized data flow, ensures the use of chaining and brackets protocols,assembles chaining responses, and assigns session sequence numbers [23, 31].andO;The sixth layer, or presentation services layer, serves to format data forend user representation and is responsible for network services such asmaintenance, management, measurement, and configuration [23, 31].andP;  Theseventh layer is the transactions services layer which provides end userinterfaces to IBM's distributed transaction architectures (Systems NetworkArchitecture Distribution Services, SNADS, Document Interchange Architecture,DIA, and Distributed Data Management, DDM) [21, 31].andM;OSIandM;The Open Systems Interconnection Reference Model was formally initiated bythe International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in March, 1977, inresponse to the international need for an open set of communicationsstandards [31].andP;  OSI's objectives are:andM;(1) to provide an architectural reference point for developing standardizedprocedures;andM;(2) to allow internetworking between networks of the same type;andM;(3) to serve as a common framework for the development of services andprotocols consistent with the OSI model;andM;(4) to expedite the offering of interoperable, multi-vendor products andservices [9, 23].andM;The model is similar in structure to that of SNA.andP;  It consists of sevenarchitectural layers: the physical layer; the data link layer, the networklayer; the transport layer; the session layer; the presentation layer; theapplication layer.andM;The physical and data link layers provide the same functions as their SNAcounterparts (physical control and data link control layers) [31].andP;  Thenetwork layer selects routing services, segments blocks and messages, andprovides error detection, recovery, and notification.andP;  The transport layercontrols point-to-point information interchange, data packet sizedetermination and transfer, and the connection/disconnection of sessionentities.andP;  The session layer serves to organize and synchronize theapplication process dialog between presentation entities, manage the exchangeof data (normal and expedited) during the session, and monitor theestablishment/release of transport connections as requested by sessionentities [23, 31].andP;  The presentation layer is responsible for the meaningfuldisplay of information to application entities.andM;More specifically, the presentation layer identifies and negotiates thechoice of communications transfer syntax and the subsequent data conversionor transormation as required [23, 31].andP;  The application layer affords theinterfacing of application processes to system interconnection facilities toassist with information exchange.andP;  The application layer is also responsiblefor the management of application processes including initialization,maintenance and termination of communications, allocation of costs andresources, prevention of deadlocks, and transmission security [31].andM;ComparisonandM;The SNA architectural layers (starting with the top layer) and their OSIfunctional counterparts are compared in Figure 2, and theadvantages/disadvantages of each protocol suite are described in Table I.andP;  AsFigure 2 shows, SNA's transaction services and presentation services layerscorrespond with the OSI application and presentation layers.andP;  SNA's data flowcontrol layer correlates with the OSI session layer, and the SNA transmissioncontrol layer corresponds to the OSI transport layer [23, 31].andP;  SNA's pathcontrol and data link layers relate to the OSI network and data link layers.andO;The OSI physical layer does not have a direct SNA counterpart and is definedoutside the SNA architecture [23].andM;Generally, for both architectures, the top three layers are largelyresponsible for the processing of information, and the middle layer ensuresthat the information sent is delivered to the proper receiving system [9].andO;The bottom three layers are concerned with basic communication--providing avehicle for the transfer of information from one system to another [9].andM;INTERCONNECTION DEVICESandM;There are eight common interconnection devices/methods used by systemsintegrators to connect OSI and SNA.andP;  These methods are:andM;(1) repeatersandM;(2) bridgesandM;(3) routersandM;(4) broutersandM;(5) gatewaysandM;(6) device emulationandM;(7) internet transmission (X.25 packet-switching), andandM;(8) intersection transmission.andM;RepeatersandM;Repeaters are transparent devices used to interconnect segments of anextended network with identical protocols and speeds at the physical layer(OSI layer 1) [31].andP;  An example of a repeater connection would be the linkageof two carrier sense multiple access/collision detection (CSMA/CD) segmentswithin a network [31].andM;BridgesandM;Bridges are devices that connect similar and dissimilar LANs at the data linklayer (layer 2), regardless of the physical layer protocols or media beingused [14, 20].andP;  Bridges require that the networks have consistent addressingschemes and packet frame sizes [31].andP;  Current introductions have been termedlearning bridges since they are capable of updating node address (tracking)tables as well as overseeing the transmission of data between two EthernetLANs [22].andM;Trying to connect an Ethernet LAN with a TokenRing LAN, however, is not aneasy task.andP;  This is mainly due to the incompatible bridge architecture thatexists between the aforementioned two types of LANs.andP;  These incompatibilitiesinclude: different frame format, different protocol design (Byte-counted vs.andO;Bit-counted), and even different operating concepts (e.g., token-passing vs.andO;CSMA/CD).andM;Currently, an IEEE 802.1 document incorporating spanning tree (e.g., analgorithm with a frame-forwarding mechanism that will avoid thesource-routing situation) tries to provide some new solution, yet it stillfails to define a way to link an Ethernet and a token-ring [20, 22, 31].andM;RoutersandM;Routers connect networks at layer 3.andP;  Routers interpret packet contentsaccording to specified protocol sets, serving to connect networks with thesame protocols (DECnet to DECnet, TCP/IP (Transmission ControlProtocol/Internet Protocol) to TCP/IP) [14, 20].andP;  Routers areprotocol-dependent; therefore, one router is needed for each protocol used bythe network.andP;  Routers are also responsible for the determination of the bestpath for data packets by routing them around failed segments of the network[1].andM;BroutersandM;Brouters are bridge/router hybrid devices that offer the best capabilities ofboth devices in one unit [22].andP;  Brouters are actually bridges capable ofintelligent routing and therefore are used as generic components to integrateworkgroup networks [20, 22].andP;  The bridge function filters information thatremains internal to the network and is capable of supporting multiplehigher-level protocols at once [20].andP;  The router component maps out theoptimal paths for the movement of datafrom one point on the network toanother [20].andP;  Since the brouter can handle the functions of both bridges androuters, as well as bypass the need for the translation across applicationprotocols with gateways, the device offers significant cost reductions innetwork development and integration [20, 22].andM;GatewaysandM;Gateways provide functional bridges between networks by receiving protocoltransactions on a layer-by-layer basis from one protocol (SNA) andtransforming them into comparable functions for the other protocol (OSI) [2].andO;In short, the gateway provides a connection with protocol translation betweennetworks that use different protocols.andP;  Interestingly enough, gateways,unlike the bridge, do not require that the networks have consistentaddressing schemes and packet frame sizes.andP;  Most proprietary gateways (suchas IBM SNA gateways) provide protocol converter functions up through layersix of the OSI, while OSI gateways perform protocol translations up throughOSI layer seven [14].andM;In addition, several PBXs can offer gateways to public data networks such asTymnet and Telenet.andP;  These gateways are usually implemented with an X.25interface.andP;  Further, current CCITT recommendation X.75 discusses the way tointerconnect different X.25 packet switching networks by implementinggateways.andM;Device EmulationandM;Device emulation is a simple method for allowing devices, specific to onenetwork, to talk with devices on a foreign network.andP;  Most micro-to-mainframecommunications are dominated by PCs emulating IBM 327X (synchronous) and DECVT-100-type (asynchronous) devices, affording connection across leased,switched, and X.25 lines [1, 2, 18].andP;  The linkage occurs by the transmissionof protocols through a gateway server which sends the message via a linkageprotocol to the mainframe [2].andM;Internet TransmissionandM;Internet transmission occurs when one protocol acts as a transmission service(layers 1 and 2) for the other, such as in the case when SNA operates acrossX.25 packet-switched networks [1, 2].andP;  In other words, the routing functionwill be handled by the client network (SNA), and X.25, in this case, onlyacts as a transmission agent.andP;  Consequently, packet switching offerssignificant cost reductions by the efficient use of bandwidths and theconcentration of multiple user transmissions over the same line [1, 16].andM;Interstation TransmissionandM;Interstation transmission occurs when network segments with differingprotocols reside together on the same local are network [2].andP;  Interstationtransmission focuses more on rendering services between LANs while theinternet transmission concentrates on the services between networks [2, 16].andO;An example would be a common lawyer 3 client residing on any of the IEEE 802protocol standards, such as CSMA/CD (802.3), token bus (802.4), andtoken-ring (802.5) [2].andP;  With full blending of layers 1 and 2, SNA and OSIupper layers can be mixed with all IEEE 802 standards [2].andM;SNA/OSI INTEGRATION STRATEGIESandM;IBM has predominantly used three SNA/OSI integration strategies:andM;(1) direct (proprietary)andM;(2) indirect (open systems), andandM;(3) mixed (selective layering).andM;IBM has approached conformance to OSI standards in a fashion similar to thatuse dby Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) with its networking solution,DECnet.andP;  DEC sought conformance to the OSI model directly on a layer-by-layerbasis while retaining DECnet's proprietary architectural nature [2].andP;  IBM hasused a layer-by-layer (direct integration) approach too, but has also usedits interconnectability with other networks (indirect integration) to providelinks to OSI.andP;  IBM's third integration technique (mixed integration) has beento use the lower layers of OSI as transmission service for SNA sessions.andO;This approach (also termed selective layering) has predominantly occurredwith X.25 packet-switched networks and OSI-based IEEE 802 data link standardssuch as Boeing's technical and office protocol (TOP) which is based on802.3--CSMA/CD, GM's manufacturing automation protocl (MAP) which is based onIEEE 802.4--Token-passing bus standard and IBM's token-ring technology(802.5) [1, 2, 27].andM;Direct IntegrationandM;The direct strategy is a layer-to-layer approach of connecting SNA to OSI asFigure 3 shows.andP;  The direct integration of SNA products to OSI standards hasbeen handled for the most part from the OSI-to-SNA perspective.andP;  As of late1987, IBM held 85 percent of the installed base of the SNA front-endprocessor (FEP) market [36].andP;  Its FEP dominance combined with its largeinstalled base for SNA networks, overall, made IBM a strategic choice by ISOmembers for integration with OSI standards.andP;  Therefore, in the first years ofOSI-SNA integration, IBM kept its architecture separate, insisting that OSImeet SNA on its own ground.andM;Direct integration greatly depends on on-site protocol converters or gatewayprocessors to provide the protocol transformations necessary between SNA andOSI suites.andP;  Protocol converters are generally FEPs outfitted withspecialized protocol translation applications.andP;  Two approaches are possiblewith gateway processors.andP;  One approach uses the gateway to perform alayer-by-layer transformation of one protocol into the comparable functionson the other [2].andM;The second approach utilizes an application process resident on both SNA andOSI protocol stacks to conduct layer-by-layer transformations [2].andP;  Gatewayprocessors provide transparent linkages between the two protocols but requirethe use of dedicated hardware and are limited by the compatibility of thefeatures for each layer.andP;  Terminal emulation is another technique used by OSInetworks to access IBM host-based applications.andP;  In most microcomputer tomainframe hookups, personal computers are emulating 327X terminals tocommunicate with IBM mainframes.andM;Advantages of Direct IntegrationandM;The relative advantages of this integration strategy are:andM;(1) transparency of the linkages--end users are not aware of the physicalconnections and data transformations occurring in the transfer of informationbetween SNA and OSI, since the gateway acts as a functional bridge performingall necessary data conversions [2];andM;(2) the capability of end-to-end connections--this strategy allows forhost-to-host connections, which is important for long-distancecommunications.andM;Disadvantages of Direct IntegrationandM;The relative disadvantages of the direct integration approach are:andM;(1) high cost--due to the need for supporting hardware and software such asPC synchronous boards, host-based software, and on-site protocol converters[32];andM;(2) limited interoperability of layers--the bottom three layers of SNA andOSI are far more compatible with one another than the upper layers of SNA andOSI (responsible for user services such as presentation and transactionservices) which have little interoperability [31];andM;(3) separation of architectures--direct integration of SNA to OSI impliesthat the two architectures are kept separate on their proprietary protocolstacks, duplicating hardware needs and providing a non-coherent view of thenetwork [2].andM;Indirect IntegrationandM;Indirect integration is an SNA-to-OSI interconnection strategy whereby anon-SNA, OSI-compliant node serves to connect the two protocols as shown inFigure 4.andP;  For example, Intermediate nodes could be vendor-provided gatewayproducts connecting an SNA network with that vendor's proprietary network.andM;DEC is one vendor committed to full compatibility with OSI standards.andP;  Thefifth generation (Phase V) of DEC's Digital Network Architecture (DNA) isintended to bring about total OSI compliance of all DECnet products [9].andO;Currently, Phase V products use OSI protocols up through the transport layer(layer 4) while maintaining prior proprietary protocols for compatibilitywith DNA phases I through IV [9].andM;Digital's goal with DECnet has been to afford the sharing of resourcesthrough a generalized interconnection of multi-vendor equipment inpoint-to-point, multipoint, and switched networks [9].andP;  One aspect of thisgoal has been realized with the DEC net/SNA gateway, which is a dedicatedcommunications processor with supporting software to link IBM and DECoperating environments [9, 16].andP;  The gateway allows users of either DEC orIBM workstations to utilize the capabilities of both systems.andP;  Yet this doesnot necessitate a technical understanding of the differences between the twoarchitectures [9].andM;Advantages of Indirect IntegrationandM;The relative advantages of this integration strategy are:andM;(1) wide range of connectivity--a wide variety of vendors (IBM, DEC, DataGeneral, Tymnet, Maxess) are offering proprietary or third-party products inconformation with OSI standards.andP;  This provides system integrations a varietyof interconnectin solutions [10, 15-17, 32];andM;(2) law development costs--it is usually less expensive to conform productsto existing proprietary networks than to start from scratch with OSI.andP;  Someof the development costs associated with these interfaces can be shared byvendors (DEC/IBM) [10];andM;(3) transparency to users--to the user the sessions with other proprietarynetworks appears as if a point-to-point link exists by having a dedicatedrouter or gateway handle the protocol conversions [5, 9].andM;Disadvantages of Indirect IntegrationandM;The disadvantages of this approach are:andM;(1) higher processing time--the interconnection to existing OSI compliantnetworks requires dedicated hardware (usually a router or gateway) whichcombined with hardware and software modifications for the new network, couldresult in performance slipage in the host computer [5, 27];andM;(2) loss of network management control--proprietary network managementcontrol is lost when interconnecting with other proprietary networks thathave their own network management systems;andM;(3) reliability--overall network reliablity will decrease due to theincreased overhead in software and hardware in the development of theSNA-non-SNA-OSI interconnections.andP;  That is, greater numbers of componentsinvolved in interconnection increase the probability of a failure occurringsomewhere in the network [5].andM;Mixed IntegrationandM;A mixed integration strategy incorporates both direct layer-to-layer andindirect via intermediate, non-SNA node interoperability.andP;  Mixed integrationoccurs when a few lower layers are fully compatible.andP;  The SNA-to-OSIcrossover occurs at an interface between the compatible lower layers and theupper layers which remain in client networks as shown in Figure 5 [5].andP;  Oneexample of the mixed approach is selective layering, when OSI networks andSNA networks run their upper level protocols independently while sharing anX.25 packet-switched network [14].andM;Since 1976, SNA and X.25 have coexisted as separate network architectures:X.25 recognized as the international standard for packet transmission and SNAacknowledged as the de facto standard for domestic data communication [1].andO;Systems intergrators can bridge the two networks by using: X.25 PADs tobridge at the link level [1, 5]; IBM XI (X.25 SNA Interconnect)--enablingdevices with X.25 interfaces to use SNA as a transport mechanism for X.25packets [9]; and IBM's Network Packet Switch Interface--a protocol converterwhich resides in the 3745 communications processor (an FEP) to expedite thetransmission of X.25 packets between the two networks at the transport layer[1, 9].andM;Advantages of Mixed IntegrationandM;The advantages of this integration strategy are:andM;(1) high interoperability between layers--by adhering to its logical linkcontrol (LLC) interface of the token-ring network typology, IBM caninterconnect with OSI layers three through seven, and SNA protocols canreside on both token-bus or Ethernet networks [2, 14];andM;(2) SNA retains network control--it maintains network control by treatingX.25 packet-switched networks as mere transmission linkages, thereforecontrolling all routing to subarea nodes [2];andM;(3) uniform treatment of any two devices on each end of the transmission--theuse of IBM's Advanced Program-to-Program Communications (APPC) affordspeer-to-peer transmissions between a wide variety of network devices (frommainframes to PCs), where the host (usually a 370 mainframe) is not requiredto manage the conservation [2, 35].andM;Disadvantages of Mixed IntegrationandM;The relative disadvantages of this integration strategy are:andM;(1) Cost--compatibility is attained by installing OSI lower-layer protocolson all nodes of the SNA network, or (as with most X.25 envinronment) bypurchasing and fitting a front-end processor with the appropriate protocolsto serve as the communications controller [27];andM;(2) Low availability--only a few of the layers for the OSI model have beenfully defined, leaving systems integrators limited options for SNA/OSIblending [3, 13];andM;(3) Security--the use of public packet-switching services often makes ittougher to limit access to the network and to ensure the safe passage finformation along the network [5].andM;SNA/OSI NETWORK ENVIRONMENTSandM;We now will evaluate the suitability of the three integration techniques inlocal area network (LAN) and wide area network (WAN) environments, inrelation to their cost effectiveness, transmission speed, flexibility, andconnectivity features (network management, security, errorprotection/detection).andP;  The advantages/disadvantages for each integrationstrategy in the LAN and WAN environments are summarized in Table II and TableIII respectively.andM;Direct Integration in the LAN EnvironmentandM;Direct integration of OSI-to-SNA protocols works well in the LAN environment.andO;The high use of the bridge and router, as opposed to the more costly andcomputationally intensive gateway, has afforded a good cost/performancetrade-off, high transmission speeds, high flexibility, and adequateconnectivity features in the LAN environment.andP;  Bridges do their connecting atthe Data Link Layer (layer 2) and are capable of linking similar anddissimilar LANs such as Ethernet (baseband or broadband) to token-ring LANsand token bus LANs to token-ring LANs [20].andP;  Bridges also provide networkmanagement functions such as traffic filtering and LAN segmentation whichhelp to avoid overloading the network with too much traffic and possiblycause a session failure [19].andP;  Routers connect networks at layer three andunlike bridges are protocol dependent.andP;  Routers assist in the integrity ofLAN to WAN connections by matching higher LAN transmission speeds with lowerWAN speeds, minimizing accidental data packet loss [20].andM;Indirect Integration in the LAN EnvironmentandM;Indirect integration offers excellent flexibility, good cost effectiveness,but mixed reviews in terms of transmission speeds and connectivity features.andO;Due to the multiplicity of vendors offering OSI compatible products, SNAnetwork managers have a variety of inter-connection routes with OSI.andP;  Sincesome of the development costs can be shared by vendors participating in jointefforts, the costs associated with this form of integration are low [9, 10].andO;Due to the high use of gateways in this integration technique, processing andtransmission speeds are slower than with direct integration [2].andO;Connectivity features such as security and network management are moredifficult due to the varying operating systems between differing proprietarynetworks.andM;Mixed Integration in the LAN EnvironmentandM;Mixed integration in LANs has great potential.andP;  Already SNA/OSI integrationhas occurred by the use of X.25 packet assembler/disassembler (PAD) bridgesat the OSI link level [1].andP;  Several vendors offer PADs that support IBM'ssynchronous data link control protocol (SDLC), offering both virtual andswitched-virtual circuits for more flexible network connections [1, 2, 7].andO;SNA and non-SNA terminals attached to an X.25 network can hook-up with an SNAhost computer via IBM's Network Packet Switch Interface (NPSI), a protocolconverter illustrated in Figure 6.andP;  Mixed integration via X.25/SNAconnections offers efficient network management, effective resourceutilization, and overall lower costs [1].andM;Direct Integration in the WAN EnvironmentandM;The WAN environment is not as promising as the LAN environment for directintegration.andP;  Because of their complex topologies and long communicationdistances, WAN transmission speeds are slower [19].andP;  The WAN environmentrequires the use of dedicated machines such as gateways and FEPs whichsignificantly add to the network's hardware and software overhead.andP;  Networksecurity, management, and error detection all pose a problem in the WANenvironment.andP;  The flexibility of linkages between WANs is provided mainly byX.25 packet switching.andP;  Some peer-to-peer connectivity is provided throughthe use of IBM's midrange Application System/400 (AS/400) computer andsupporting software [1, 5, 11, 13, 24, 25].andM;Indirect Integration in the WAN EnvironmentandM;Indirect integration in the WAN environment offers more promise than directintegration does, due to the high-installed base of proprietary networks.andO;DEC, HP, and others all have products in the marketplace that connect SNAhosts to OSI-based networks [9, 19].andP;  Indirect integration shares the sameproblems of low transmission speeds and low connectivity features as directin the WAN environment, but offers more flexible migration paths.andM;Mixed Integration in the WAN EnvironmentandM;Mixed integration offers many wide area networking solutions, largely due tothe large-installed base of packet-switching technology.andP;  The CSI-X.25multi-protocol controller (Microtronix Systems Ltd.) connects X.25 public andprivate networks to IBM 370 host computers, as well as asynchronous terminalsand IBM SNA/SDLC controllers [7].andP;  Figure 7 shows the connection amongdifferent components.andP;  X.25 multi-protocol converters offer excellent networkthroughout rates and access speeds for the WAN environment [7].andM;CONCLUSIONandM;The three SNA/OSI integration strategies have assisted IBM in its quest forfull OSI compliance and support of open system networks.andP;  The directstrategy, although requiring increased dependence on IBM for productannouncements and significant use of processing intensive technologies,affords SNA network managers a viable and sustained migration path towardOSI.andP;  The direct approach is better adapted for the LAN rather than the WANenvironment where cost-effective bridges, routers, and brouters can beutilized to connect similar and dissimilar nodes on the network.andM;The indirect strategy provides excellent flexibility due to multi-vendor andthird-party networking solutions and good cost effectiveness through the useof existing systems equipment and software.andP;  The indirect strategy works wellin both LAN and WAN environments but offers more flexible migration paths inthe WAN environment due to the high-installed base of proprietary networks.andM;The mixed approach to SNA/OSI interconnection offers great promise for futurecommunications between SNA and OSI networks, despite the limited operabilityof SNA and OSI model upper layers.andP;  The WAN environment is ideally suited forthis integration technique due to the proliferation of X.25 packet-switchingnetworks and the use of multi-protocol controllers.andP;  The future use of packetswitching by IBM looks secure since IBM has forged strong links domesticallywith central office switch manufacturers and regional Bell operatingcompanies and internationally with siemens (IBM's partner in Rolm) in aneffort to push SNA into the intelligent public network arena [8, 29].andM;Future developmentsandM;Originally, IBM took a look-and-see posture toward OSI, resulting in only afew directly integrative products being developed in Europe.andP;  Currently IBMhas committed itself to OSI, conducting OSI development work on layers threethrough six in Palo Alto, CA., on layer seven in Rome, Italy, and on most ofthe upper-level layers in Heidelberg, West Germany [9].andM;Recent product announcement which will assist in the future of direct-,indirect-, and mixed-integration strategies are:andM;(1) IBM Open Systems Message Exchange (OSI/OSME) (9/88)--an OSI applicationfor exchaning X.400 electronic message applications [1, 4];andM;(2) IBM OSI Communications Subsystem (OSI/CS) (9/88)--which permits theconnection of IBM and non-IBM nodes over an OSI protocol, as well as theinterconnection SAA applications, equipment, and networks [1, 4];andM;(3) IBM OSI/File Services (9/88)--a licensed program overseeing the transferand management of data over IBM and non-IBM systems [4].andM;OSI/CS and OSI/File Services will not be widely available until 1990, butOSME message-exchange products were already in service by the end of 1988.andM;In the immediate future, SNA and OSI interconnection will be a more prominentissue.andP;
