Britain's U.N. ambassador, Sir Crispin Tickell, met Lucio Garciadel Solar, director-general of Argentina's Foreign Ministry, to``seek to establish the conditions and agenda for direct talksbetween the United Kingdom and Argentina,'' according to Britain'sU.N. mission.   The mission said the meetings ``will be without prejudice to thesovereignty positions of either side regarding the FalklandIslands.''   The talks opened Wednesday but no details on the times andlocations were disclosed. An official communique is expected afterthey conclude Thursday.   Although the dialogue is not taking place under U.N. auspices,``it is an encouraging development that Secretary-General JavierPerez de Cuellar welcomes,'' said his spokesman, Francois Giuliani.   Argentina's new president, Carlos Saul Menem, made the dialoguepossible when he dropped his country's insistence that Argentina'sclaim to the islands it calls the Malvinas be the first step in anytalks.   A meeting between British and Argentine government officials inBern, Switzerland, in July 1984 broke down when Argentina raised thesovereignty issue as a precondition.   In April 1982, Argentina invaded the islands, where 2,000 peopleof British descent live. Britain counterattacked and defeatedArgentina in a six-week war that cost nearly 1,000 lives.   Britain cut ties with Argentina and has said it will nevernegotiate sovereignty of the islands, where the population hasexpressed almost unanimous preference for continuing their colonialrelationship with Britain.   Argentina and Britain have held indirect talks through the UnitedStates on such issues as fish conservation.   Menem's government would like to recover fishing rights in thearea around the Falklands. Britain currently enforces a 150-mileexclusion zone, steering Argentine vessels away from the area.   Many nations fish in the areas just outside the exclusion zone,largely unregulated, and Britain and Argentina would like to reachan accord on regulating fishing in the south Atlantic.   Both countries have lifted bans on importing each others'products, with Buenos Aires taking the step this month. Britainlifted its ban in 1985.   Diplomats said Argentina is also looking ahead to the unifiedEuropean Community in 1992 and realizes it must mend fences withBritain, which will be one of the major members of the newEuromarket, the largest trade bloc in the world.   The Falkland Islands are 300 miles east of the Strait of Magellan.   A British explorer sighted them in 1592, and Britons landed onthem in 1690. They have been under British rule since 1833, butArgentina claims it inherited the land when it declared independencefrom Spain in 1810.</TEXT></DOC>
