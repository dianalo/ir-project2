The costof trading some stocks is getting fatter, not leaner, andcould eat into some of your gains.   Small issues have been this year's hottest stock-marketperformers, and many investors are flocking to join thesmall-stock rally. But as over-the-counter tradingdepartments enjoy record profits, big and little clientsalike are griping that Wall Street companies have reaped someof their windfall at their customers' expense. Even thoughcompetition for small shares is hot, brokers' trading chargesfor some stocks are growing, not shrinking.</LP><TEXT>   The reasons? Traders blame the widespread zigzags in stockprices and say they are forced to charge more to protectthemselves from possible losses. They say that new federalrules aimed at curbing abuses by some OTC professionalsshould lead to more fluid trading and reduce the costs oftrading small issues.   Some big investors, however, suspect that trading desksare under intense pressure by their parent companies toharvest handsome gains. &quot;Pressures are mounting on the desksto be profitable,&quot; particularly at publicly traded brokeragefirms, says Michael L. Murphy, senior vice president ofMorgan Grenfell Capital Management.   As small-stock yardsticks hit record highs, brokeragefirms' OTC trading revenues are expected to exceed $2 billionthis year -- 53% ahead of last year and 14% higher than1987's record level, according to the Securities IndustryAssociation, a trade group.   The individual investor, everyone agrees, pays the highestprice.   &quot;The retail guy is getting hurt,&quot; says Alan Radlo, managerof the $810 million Fidelity OTC Fund. Brokers giveinstitutions, such as Fidelity, discounts on trading costs inreturn for their big business, but charge individuals more tocompensate for the smaller return they get on their trades.   Buyers and sellers in the OTC market meet and negotiateprices through brokerage companies' &quot;market makers.&quot; Thesemiddlemen trade by telephone and electronically on Nasdaq,the electronic OTC trading system run by the NationalAssociation of Securities Dealers.   Market makers earn their revenue not only through thecommissions that investors pay when they trade, but also on astock's &quot;spread,&quot; or the difference between the highestprice, or &quot;bid,&quot; at which someone is willing to buy a stock,and the lowest price, or &quot;ask,&quot; at which the same or anotherperson is willing to sell. When there is lots of competitionfor big OTC stocks with dozens of market makers, such asMicrosoft or MCI Communications, the spreads are narrow --1/8, or 12.5 cents a share, to 1/4, or 25 cents a share --similar to those on the exchanges where hundreds of investorsalso compete for big stocks.   Yet in the past year, spreads have widened even on largerOTC stocks -- despite fierce competition for them during thisyear's rally in small stocks. Medco Containment Services, forexample, a fast-growing provider of prescription drugs bymail, closed Friday at $65 a share with a 75-cent spread.Some bid and ask prices for Medco were as far apart as $1.50.Yet Medco has 55.2 million shares outstanding, or slightlymore than average for the stocks listed on the New York StockExchange, and a market value of $3.6 billion.   &quot;We've noticed in the past year that some individualmarket makers were widening their spreads,&quot; says NASDPresident Joseph Hardiman.   When an investor buys a small stock, the spread may be asmall -- or major -- part of the trading costs. It alldepends on the stock he or she is buying.   For example, the highest closing bid Friday on Microsoftwas $89.50 a share and the lowest ask was $89.75. A marketmaker could charge 25 cents a share to a customer who bought100 shares of Microsoft at the bid, or a total of $25. Thenhe adds on an average 4% commission, or $358, on the $8,950worth of Microsoft stock. The average commission from afull-service brokerage firm commission for a &quot;round trip,&quot; orbuy and sell order, by an individual is 4%, according to theAmerican Association of Individual Investors in Chicago.   The total charge by the broker would be $383 on $8,950worth of stock, or 4.3%. Microsoft would have to climb atleast $3.875 a share, slightly more than 4.3%, before youcould begin to profit from selling your stock -- not a bigjump for the software powerhouse.   However, the stocks of smaller companies with littleinvestor demand can have huge spreads of $2 a share or moreand require much bigger gains, on a percentage basis, beforeyou can profit.   Consider Badger Paper Mills Inc. of Peshtigo, Wis., whichtrades just an average of 480 shares a day, compared withMicrosoft's average of 1.1 million shares a day. Friday, thebid price for Badger Paper Mills was $24.50 a share and theask $26.50; the $2 spread is 8% of the purchaser's price.With an average 4% commission, the stock would have to climbmore than 12% -- or $3 a share -- before you could begin toprofit. That's a big and rare move for a small company suchas Badger.   For many individual investors, &quot;the realization of largespreads doesn't hit home until they see their transactioncosts,&quot; says John Markese of American Association ofIndividual Investors. &quot;It particularly can be a killer onshort-term transactions,&quot; he adds -- one reason he advisesagainst short-term trading of smaller stocks. &quot;If you turnaround in these in a short period of time, you're going toeat a lot of costs.&quot;   NASD's Mr. Hardiman pictures the widening of spreads byOTC market makers as a defensive move: a reaction toprofessional traders who flood NASD's Small Order ExecutionSystem, which automatically executes orders of 1,000 sharesor less, with simultaneous orders. The wave of instant ordersdrives prices up or down before market makers can adjusttheir own prices. They in turn drop or raise their pricesunder pressure from the multiple SOES orders.   OTC traders expect smoother trading and smaller spreadswhen new rules limiting the SOES professionals becomeeffective. The rules, recently passed by the Securities andExchange Commission, are on temporary hold.   Small investors, in the meantime, should take severalprecautions to avoid paying more than necessary when they buyand sell small stocks, Mr. Markese advises.   -- Stay clear of the &quot;pink sheets,&quot; where thinly tradedstocks that don't meet Nasdaq's trading requirements arelisted. It's difficult to find out what the spreads for thesestocks are.   -- Determine the average daily volume in a stock you areinterested in. A big order can have a big impact on a thinlytraded stock and drive the spread sharply wider.   -- Find a broker who will negotiate spreads for you. Askwhat the spread is. Calculate it as a percentage of the bidprice. Work with your broker to establish a realistic pricerelative to the spread, rather than simply putting in amarket order to buy or sell at the prevailing -- butundetermined -- price.   &quot;A market order may end in financial shock,&quot; says Mr.Markese, particularly if your order is big, the stock'svolume is small and the spread is wide.   ---   Friday's Market Activity                                                                                                          Over-the-counter stocks continued to sink amid persistentworries about the economy.   The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 3.62 to 525.13, a 0.68%loss, as volume slipped to more than 173.9 million sharesfrom 199.4 million shares Thursday. Decliners outweighedadvancers, 1,056 to 880, but 80 stocks reached new highs as41 fell to new lows.   For the week, the Nasdaq Composite slipped 2.6%, comparedwith a slightly smaller 2.4% drop in the larger shares of theDow Jones Industrial Average. However, Nasdaq volumeoutstripped New York Stock Exchange volume for the seventhconsecutive week.   Several new issues grabbed the spotlight. IMRS Inc., theday's most active OTC stock, closed at 15 3/4, compared withan initial offering of 3.2 million shares at of $12.50 each.The Stamford, Conn., maker of business software originallyhad planned to sell just 2.9 million shares at $9 to $11each.   Goody's Family Clothing, the second most active issue,rose to 16 1/2 from an offering price of $15 a share. MitekSurgical Products jumped to 24 3/4 from an offering price of$16 each.   Tyco Toys climbed 7/8 to 28 3/4, breaking the 52-week highit set Thursday. The company reported that third-quarterearnings from operations rose to $1.57 a share from $1.09 ashare a year earlier. Tyco said that it expectsfourth-quarter sales to rise sharply from their year-earlierlevel and lift full-year sales to more than $520 million.   T. Rowe Price Associates jumped 1 1/2 to 37. The Baltimoremutual-fund company's third-quarter net income climbed to 58cents a share from 45 cents a share a year earlier. Revenuerose to $52.6 million from $44.6 million.   Cable television shares sank after the FederalCommunications Commission said that it will encouragetelephone companies to compete with cable television byintroducing new video technology that would deliver videoprogramming to homes through telephone wires. AmericanTelevision andamp; Communications lost 1 1/4 to 50 1/4,Tele-Communications Class A dropped 5/8 to 14 7/8 and TCACable TV slipped 1 3/4 to 17.</TEXT></DOC>
