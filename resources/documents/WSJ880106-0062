Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> BT LATAM </CO><IN> BNK MON </IN><TEXT>   In early 1984, some officers at New York's Bankers Trust Co. devised a way for Mexico to shed some of its huge U.S. bank debt -- a plan remarkably similar to one embraced last week by Morgan Guaranty Trust Co. and Mexico -- but it didn't fly.    The Bankers Trust plan was privately circulated within the bank and shown to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. But it was never publicized. And it eventually was shot down by Bankers Trust's senior management.    &quot;It was an idea whose time had not yet come,&quot; says Raymond D. Smith Jr., a managing director at Bankers Trust in London. &quot;The problem was the time wasn't right; there hadn't been enough pain.&quot; Mr. Smith adds: &quot;Maybe we didn't push it far enough or hard enough.&quot;    A copy of the now-defunct Bankers Trust plan shows that its executives proposed a sweeping Mexican debt-relief scheme. The plan would have reduced by at least 38% -- and possibly entirely -- the $70 billion that the Mexican government and private Mexican companies owed commercial banks.    Mexico would have purchased 15-year, zero-coupon securities issued by the U.S., foreign governments and the World Bank sufficient to cover the principal and interest it owed -- which together totaled an estimated $284.6 billion over 15 years. The securities would then be placed in a trust, which in turn would issue its own bonds to be swapped for Mexico's commercial bank debt outstanding. The trust's securities would be backed by the zero-coupon bonds.    A similar zero-coupon bond transaction is at the heart of the Mexican debt arrangement announced late last month. Mexico plans to let the banks exchange, at a discount, some Mexican debt they hold for as much as $10 billion in new 20-year bonds Mexico will issue. The principal on the new bonds will be backed by U.S. Treasury 20-year, zero-coupon bonds.    The Morgan plan could save Mexico an estimated $18 billion in interest payments over 20 years. The Bankers Trust plan aimed even higher, saving between $75.7 billion and $102.9 billion over 15 years. &quot;After 15 years, Mexico wouldn't owe any principal,&quot; says Arvind Rajkumar, the plan's chief architect, now chief financial officer of ADS Associates Inc., a Calabasas, Calif.-based software company.    An earlier, even more lofty version of the scheme was shown to the New York Fed. It called for a fund to rescue all heavily indebted developing countries under the International Monetary Fund.    But neither the Fed nor Bankers Trust top management bought the idea. &quot;The reaction coming down the ladder was 'why have a solution to a problem that doesn't exist,'&quot; says Mr. Rajkumar.    &quot;At the time, there was a total inability within the system to take write-offs; that's the difference between 1984 and 1988,&quot; says Peter Rona, president of IBJ-Schroder Bank andamp; Trust Co. &quot;What makes (the Morgan-Mexican proposal) fly is that it forces write-offs and gives the benefit to the lesser-developed countries, which is where it belongs.&quot;    Mr. Rajkumar became so frustrated he even sent a copy of his proposals to magazine publisher Malcolm Forbes. &quot;He never bothered to reply,&quot; says Mr. Rajkumar. </TEXT></DOC>
