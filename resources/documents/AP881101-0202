Despite the potential for astronomic financial returns on theirinvestment, several fund managers said Monday they would have toreconsider their commitment to the New York-based firm if Nabisco'stop management ultimately failed to embrace the deal.   Last week, Kohlberg Kravis launched a $90-a-share tender offerfor Atlanta-based Nabisco that is contingent upon approval by thecompany's board.   Nabisco's top managers, who put their company in play byannouncing they were considering taking the company private for $75a share, or about $17 billion, are not expected to be able to matchKohlberg Kravis's offer, but they still are resisting the KohlbergKravis bid.   Either of those offers would produce the biggest U.S. takeoverever, and Kohlberg Kravis was widely viewed as ready to fight tomaintain its position as the premier buyout firm, raising thequestion of whether it might be willing to make its first hostiletakeover bid. Negotiations collapsed last week in an attempt toshare the deal between Kohlberg Kravis and Shearson Lehman HuttonInc., Nabisco's primary financial partner.   With a $5.6 billion warchest that can be ``leveraged'' tenfoldby borrowing, Kohlberg Kravis is backed by roughly 70 investorsthat range from the Salvation Army to the endowment funds ofHarvard and Yale to the pension funds of New York, Wisconsin,Minnesota and other states. Among the corporations whose pensionfunds have pledged some assets are Coca-Cola, Georgia-Pacific andUnited Technologies.   Minnesota's Board of Investment, which invests state employees'pension money, committed about $200 million to Kohlberg Kravis onthe basis that the firm would participate only in ``friendly''deals _ those supported by the target's board.   ``If they change their procedures, we'd have to review'' thestate's commitment, said Howard Bicker, the board's executivedirector.   ``KKR has always said they are going to do friendly deals, andfrom what we understand, although this has been painted differentlyin some of the press, this deal still is basically on friendlybasis,'' he said.   In the brief span of years that Kohlberg Kravis has beeninvesting in risky leveraged buyout deals, Bicker said, returnshave averaged 30 percent to 40 percent annually, enough to gladdenany pension manager.   But industry observers note that these buyout funds have been inexistence too few years to establish a definitive trend. ``Thereisn't a long track record _ you can't look at 60 years of data''like you can with the stock market, said Richard Brody, aninvestment consultant in the Atlanta office of Hewitt Associates, apension consulting firm.   In the five years that the leveraged buyout has blossomed, thebusiness environment has been particularly favorable to this typeof transaction, Brody said.   In a leveraged buyout, roughly 90 percent of an acquisition ispaid for with debt, which is then reduced by selling off parts ofthe company or by dramatic cost-cutting that boosts cash flow.Kohlberg Kravis is expected to provide only about $2 billion incash _ most from its leveraged buyout fund _ to finance the Nabiscodeal.   Pension fund managers note that investments in buyout funds orin the buyouts themselves are extremely risky. Most pension fundsallocate between 5 percent to 10 percent of their total assets towhat Brody described as ``riskier and more esoteric forms ofinvestment,'' including real estate, venture capital, oil and gasexploration and leveraged buyouts.   A further problem is that there is little liquidity withleveraged buyouts. It is not easy to get money out while the buyoutwizards still are trying to sell a company's assets.   John Donaldson, controller at Avon Products Inc., said hiscompany's pension fund has about $10 million invested with KohlbergKravis. While the firm's ``historic pattern of returns makes itworth looking at, the volatility is much greater than with generalequities,'' he said.   ``We would rather they not do hostile deals as a matter of (our)corporate conscience, but we do believe KKR does not do hostiledeals,'' he said.   But given that premise, Donaldson said that any time a moneymanager such as Kohlberg Kravis does ``something out of theordinary, something that departs from their historic activity, wewould review'' the investment.   Some corporations that consider themselves potential takeovertargets might shy from investing in leveraged buyout funds simplybecause they would not want to support an industry that one daymight threaten them, some experts speculated.</TEXT></DOC>
