Usually, higher demand for a commodity means higher prices. But not so lately in the crude oil market. In fact, stronger demand is a principal reason for the recent plunge in crude prices -- which may not have run its course.    This unusual development begins with motorists in the U.S. and Europe. A summer surge in gasoline use is causing motor fuel prices to remain firm. Nothing unusual in that, to be sure.    Strong product prices mean that refiners are reaping huge profits on every barrel they process. That, in turn, has sent them on an oil-buying binge, even though there's a glut of crude.    Enter the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. With its members struggling to make every sale possible in the oversupplied world market, OPEC has been obliging the refiners' heavy demand. Thus, in the seasonally weak third quarter, OPEC is pumping more oil into a market that was weak to begin with. &quot;Voila.&quot; Prices have plunged.    Market reaction to this week's news that Iran would accept a U.N. resolution for a cease-fire in its eight-year war with Iraq briefly reversed the trend. But Monday's strong rally fizzled yesterday as world crude prices settled lower. West Texas Intermediate crude closed at $15.23 a barrel, down 47 cents, on U.S futures markets. North Sea Brent was quoted late in the day at $15.05 a barrel, down five cents, on European spot markets.    Whatever the outlook for crude and product prices, it's clear a new dynamic is at work in the oil market. &quot;There has been a kind of decoupling of crude and product prices,&quot; says Cyrus H. Tahmassebi, chief economist of Ashland Oil Inc.    That helps explain the puzzle of the recent surge in OPEC production. But it may also have trapped OPEC in an oil market merry-go-round.    The 13 revenue-hungry members of OPEC are every bit as eager to sell their crude as the refiners are to buy it. But the more crude that OPEC produces, the cheaper it gets. That's due in part to their pricing formulas, which generally are linked to spot prices.    Except for occasional runups, spot prices have been declining since June because of perceptions that the world is awash with crude and that OPEC won't cut back output to trim the surplus. These spot-price declines have been quickly reflected in OPEC pricing formulas.    Generally, the OPEC members are receiving less than $13.50 barrel for their crudes, compared with an official benchmark of $18. To maintain revenue as per-barrel prices drop, OPEC must produce even more. The producers have to run faster, in effect, to stay even.    If the recent buying waves from refiners hadn't developed, oil prices probably still would have fallen although perhaps not as much. But reports about the additional production by OPEC -- to meet the increased demand from refiners -- served as a psychological trigger to oil traders already wary of the world-wide glut. And even though refiners were buying, speculators and others sold.    Since late June, OPEC production has surged by more than 500,000 barrels a day to more than 19 million barrels a day. That's at least 1.5 million barrels a day over OPEC's implied production ceiling.    Many oil analysts draw a parallel between today's environment and the one that led to the 1986 price crash. Then, as now, OPEC battled for market share and refiners' profits surged as crude prices declined. But in 1986 prices of petroleum products fell but trailed the decline in crude prices. In recent weeks, product prices have been rising even as crude prices fell.    In calculations for the Oil Buyers Guide, Marshall Thomas of PetroMar Associates determined that since the end of May refining values for a barrel of fuels processed on the U.S. Gulf Coast have increased to more than $19 from $18.60, based on cash-market product prices. Spot prices of West Texas Intermediate crude have declined, meanwhile, by at least $2 a barrel from $17.50 in the same period.    As a result, refining margins -- which were &quot;good&quot; at the end of May at around $1 a barrel -- &quot;have gone up anywhere from a doubling to as much as four times, depending on the crude,&quot; says Mr. Thomas. &quot;All this could end next week,&quot; he says, &quot;but there is an incentive for refiners to buy crude if OPEC has oil available.&quot;    Much the same is happening in Europe where refiners' margins have climbed to between $2 and $4.50 a barrel, London oil analysts say. Several analysts in the U.S., including William Randol of First Boston Corp., have reiterated &quot;buy&quot; recommendations on shares of refining companies such as Ashland.    Mr. Randol says the sharp upward trend in refiner margins is unusual for the middle of the driving season. &quot;Margins historically have peaked by mid-year,&quot; he says. But U.S. gasoline stocks are close to an eight-year low while demand has outstripped the industry's physical ability to manufacture unleaded fuel, he says.    The indicated tightness in U.S. gasoline ought to prevent the refiners' flat-out production from leading to a product price war. The decline in crude prices eventually will end, however. Or product prices could again become linked to those for crude. And gasoline demand usually drops after Labor Day. But Mr. Randol suggests that a trend &quot;toward permanently improved refiner margins is sustainable.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
