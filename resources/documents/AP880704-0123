George Bush expressed his regretsabout the tragedy, but said the incident should not change U.S.policy in the Persian Gulf.   Jesse Jackson, meanwhile, urged President Reagan to offerreparations to the families of victims of the downed Iranian jet,saying an immediate goodwill gesture was needed to save the livesof U.S. hostages held in Lebanon.   Both Dukakis and Jackson later focused their attention on theDemocratic ticket, meeting for dinner at the Massachusettsgovernor's Brookline home and later attending Boston's IndependenceDay celebrations.   Aides to the likely Democratic nominee described the evening asa social gathering, but said Dukakis' search for a running matewould likely be discussed.   Jackson has said he has decided whether he would accept a vicepresidential offer, but refuses to disclose his decision. Hecontends that he deserves to be offered the No. 2 spot on theticket.   Dukakis has said Jackson is being considered but says he owes nocandidate an offer.   At the Charlestown Navy Yard, Dukakis departed from the preparedtext of a Fourth of July speech to appeal to Iran not to try toseek revenge through terrorism. He renewed his call for aninternational effort to end the nearly 8-year-old Iran-Iraq war.   ``While we all deeply regret the tragedy, this is no time foracts of terror or revenge in response to the incident,'' Dukakissaid at the berth of the USS Constitution. ``So I urge thegovernment of Iran to reconsider its threats and to join us and theentire international community to ending a war that already hastaken the lives of more than one million people.''   Mohammad Ja-Afar Mahallati, Iranian ambassador to the UnitedNations, said the downing of the Iran Air Airbus was premeditatedand he called it ``cold-blooded murder.''   ``By definition, it was an act of terrorism that ... should beseverely punished,'' he said.   The USS Vincennes shot down the commercial jetliner on Sundaywhile engaged in battle with Iranian gunboats. The Pentagon saidthe Vincennes crew believed the wide-bodied Airbus was a smallerF-14 fighter about to attack the ship.   ``Clearly, we have the right to defend our forces againstimminent threat, and apparently the shooting down of the airlineroccurred over what appears to have been an unprovoked attackagainst our forces,'' Dukakis said.   Vice President Bush, campaigning in the Midwest, spoke out forthe first time on the incident, expressing deep regret.   ``Obviously, as we celebrate our great national holiday ourhearts go out to the loved ones and families of those who were lostand also (hearts) go out to those kids, those young Americans whoare defending freedom halfway around the world,'' he said.   The all-but-certain Republican nominee said he believed U.S.policy in the gulf will remain the same. ``Life goes on, ourmission goes on and the world keeps turning,'' Bush said.   The vice president continued his campaign schedule, saying``there is nothing I can be doing about this matter in WashingtonD.C.''   However, Bush planned to attend a White House briefing on thegulf incident on Tuesday, according to aides.   Prior to leaving Chicago for his meeting with Dukakis, Jacksonsaid the shooting incident complicates the situation in the gulfregion at a time when there were indications that forces in Iranfavoring negotiations were gaining strength.   ``I am sincerely concerned that we make a gesture of goodwillimmediately so as to protect the lives of Americans who are in theregion, specifically the Americans who are held hostage there,'' hesaid.   Jackson urged Reagan to go on television to express ``genuineregrets'' about the plane's downing and ``offer reparations to thefamilies to ease some of the pain.'' The president has already saidhe deeply regrets the loss of life.   Jackson also called on the Reagan administration to re-evaluateits Middle East policy but said the United States should maintain apresence in the war-torn gulf.   ``We should not move out unilaterally. The fact is they areinternational waters. We do have a right to be there,'' Jacksonsaid.</TEXT><HEAD>___</HEAD><HEAD>Material Embargoed for 8:01 p.m. EDT Release</HEAD><TEXT>   On a lighter note, a blueblood directory in London said Bush isa distant cousin of Queen Elizabeth II and has blood ties withevery other European royal family on or off the throne.
