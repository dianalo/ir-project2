Case studiesbased on interviews, questionnaires and systematic observations havebeen undertaken to identify critical factors in human computer design,in operator competence and attitudes and in work organization. It isshown that certain features of the humancomputer interaction become criticalwhen serious disturbances are encountered. Likewise focusing on requirementsduring disturbances in particular has highlighted some new aspects ofoperator competence and of the work organization. The results are consideredto be useful input to safety management in petroleum process plants,in formation of design specifications and in identifying need for furtherresearch regarding safety in offshore production.</TEXT></DOC>
