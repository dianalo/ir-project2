The high court, by a 6-3 vote, said such &quot;fetalprotection&quot; policies, currently used by more than a dozenmajor corporations with tens of thousands of workers, are aform of sex bias that is prohibited by federal civil rightslaw.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Women as capable of doing their jobs as their malecounterparts may not be forced to choose between having acchild and having a job,&quot; the high court said in an opinionwritten by Justice Harry Blackmun.   Women's rights groups hailed the decision as an importantvictory, one that averted the threat that the Supreme Courtwould make it easier for employers to justify practices thatdiscriminate against women. &quot;It is a great relief for womenthat these policies are all illegal,&quot; said AlisonWetherfield, legal director of NOW Legal Defense andEducation Fund.   Business groups, however, were disappointed. &quot;Obviously,any fetal-protection policies are out the window,&quot; saidStephen Bokat, vice president and general counsel of the U.S.Chamber of Commerce. &quot;But there's a difficult quandary forbusiness here,&quot; he added. &quot;What are they going to do toprotect these people?&quot;   The only issue on which organized labor, business andwomen's groups agree is that employers must warn all workersof the risks of exposure to harmful substances in theworkplace. The groups disagree on how well business has donethat job.   Business groups say employers have been warning workers ofjob health and safety risks for years. But Ms. Wetherfieldargued that &quot;most employers don't adequately inform employeesof the degree of the risk.&quot;   Employers worry that if they don't adopt policies toprotect workers who may become pregnant, they could facepersonal injury lawsuits under state laws when infants areborn with birth defects. Yesterday, Justice Blackmun tried toreassure business that if an &quot;employer fully informs thewoman of the risk and the employer has not acted negligently,the basis for holding an employer liable seems remote atbest.&quot;   But Justice Byron White, joined in dissent by ChiefJustice William Rehnquist and Justice Anthony Kennedy, saidthis was little more than speculation on Justice Blackmun'spart. &quot;Such speculation will be small comfort to employers,&quot;they said.   The case involved interpretation of Title VII of the 1964Civil Rights Act, which prohibits discrimination inemployment. The law contains an exception for policies that-- although they obviously discriminate on the basis of sex,religion or national origin -- are nevertheless a &quot;bona fideoccupational qualification reasonably necessary to the normaloperation of that particular business.&quot;   The high court said yesterday that this so-called &quot;BFOQ&quot;exception is a narrow one, limited to policies that aredirectly related to a worker's ability to do the job.   At issue was the policy of Johnson Controls Inc., a carbattery manufacturer that excluded women of childbearing agefrom jobs involving exposure to lead. The company argued thatthe policy falls within the &quot;BFOQ&quot; exception because it isessential to a safe workplace.   But the high court said the exception applies only topolicies that involve the &quot;essence of the business,&quot; such asworker or customer safety, not the safety of an unborn fetus.&quot;No one can disregard the possibility of injury to futurechildren,&quot; wrote Justice Blackmun. But he added that theexception &quot;is not so broad that it transforms this deepsocial concern into an essential aspect of battery making.&quot;   Marsha Berzon, a San Francisco lawyer who handled theUnited Auto Workers' lawsuit against the Johnson Controlspolicy, said the high court's interpretation of the &quot;BFOQ&quot;exception was consistent with what federal district andappeals courts have said in numerous cases. &quot;Had the courtsaid something else, it would really have opened up anenormous can of worms,&quot; she said.   The dissenters also disagreed with this part of thecourt's decision. They said that the court interpreted theexception in the law too narrowly and that there might becircumstances in which a fetal protection policy could bejustified as a bona fide occupational qualification. The Bushadministration filed a friend-of-the-court brief that tookmuch the same view as the dissenters.   Taking up the dissenters' concern, the Chamber's Mr. Bokatsaid, &quot;We knew this was a narrow exception, but the court issaying it's really narrow.&quot;   The case was the first in which the court's newest member,Justice David Souter, had to take a position on a sexdiscrimination issue. Women's rights groups, several of whichopposed his nomination, said they were pleased that he agreedwith all of Justice Blackmun's opinion.   Women's groups said the decision should cause employers toincrease job safety. &quot;This is a resounding victory for womenworkers, for all workers, because it places theresponsibility to ensure workplace safety on employers,&quot;asserted Joan Bertin of the American Civil Liberties UnionWomen's Rights Project.   Some anti-abortion organizations criticized the ruling.The American Life League said in a statement that the courthad ruled &quot;that motherhood is nothing more than second-classcitizenship.&quot;   Business has often expressed concern about the high costof providing a safer workplace. That concern found anaudience in the three dissenting justices and in JusticeAntonin Scalia's separate opinion. These justices suggestedthat the high cost of making a workplace safe for women ofchildbearing age could sometimes be a legitimatejustification for a discriminatory policy.   Johnson Controls said it may return to a voluntary fetalpolicy that was in place until 1982, when it adopted amandatory policy. The company said that it was &quot;disappointed&quot;by the ruling but that the &quot;economic impact&quot; on the company&quot;is not expected to be material.&quot;   The justices reversed the September 1989 ruling of afederal appeals court in Chicago that upheld JohnsonControls' policy of barring women of childbearing age fromjobs where the lead concentration in their blood could beabove safe levels, unless they could prove with medicalrecords that they were infertile. The policy was challengedby individual employees and by the UAW on the basis that itdeprived women of job opportunities that were available tomen. (UAW vs. Johnson Controls Inc.)</TEXT></DOC>
