Magistrate P.H. Bredenkamp imposed the maximum penalty on DavidBruce for his refusal to undergo the military training required ofall white males in South Africa.   ``The consequences of your imprisonment are in you own hands,''Bredenkamp told Bruce, 25. ``You have had the opportunity ... toprovide a useful service to the public.''   The training involves two years of initial service. Afterward,men are subject to annual military call-ups that can last as longas three months.   ``My view of the South African Defense Force is that it is not apeace-keeping force but that its basic function is that ofupholding and defending racism,'' Bruce said last week at his trial.   Bruce declined to request a non-combat posting, which sometimesis granted to men who object to military training on religiousgrounds. Bruce refused to serve for moral and political reasons,saying he strongly opposed the government's apartheid policies ofracial segregation.   The government does not release statistics on how many white menrefuse to serve in the military.</TEXT></DOC>
