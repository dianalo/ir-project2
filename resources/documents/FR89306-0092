These proposed amendments are intended to expand Agency guidance on theanalysis of developmental toxicity data in accordance with appropriatescientific standards and with the policies and procedures established inthe statutes administered by the EPA. The proposed amendments were developedas part of an interoffice guidelines development program under the auspicesof the Agency's Risk Assessment Forum. The proposed amendments are based,in part, on recommendations developed in scientific workshops. The public is invited to comment and public comments will be consideredin final Agency decisions on amending the current guidelines. Commentorsare asked to focus on several special issues, particularly, (1) a proposednew weight-of-evidence scheme and its use, and (2) the advantages and disadvantagesof using this scheme only for hazard identification versus using it inconjunction with dose-response and exposure assessment information. Also,comments are invited on the use of the special term ``reference dose fordevelopmental toxicity (RfD<T2>DT</T2>).'' The term RfD<T2>DT</T2> is used to distinguish the time-limited reference dose forexposure during development from the reference dose (RfD), which generallyrefers to chronic exposure situations. The proposed amendments are individually identified and explained in theSupplementary Information section of this notice, The full text of theproposed guidelines is published in the following section. As used in thisnotice, the term ``proposed guidelines'' refers to the current guidelinesas modified by the proposed amendments. The request for comment appliesonly to the proposed amendments, but EPA will also consider any importantnew scientific information bearing on the proposed guidelines as a whole.EPA's Science Advisory Board (SAB) also will review the proposed amendmentsat a meeting to be announced in a future FEDERAL REGISTER. Agency staffwill prepare summaries of the public and SAB comments, analyses of majorissues presented by commentors, and Agency responses to those comments.Appropriate comments will be incorporated, and the amended guidelines willbe submitted to the Risk Assessment Forum and the Risk Assessment Councilfor review. The Risk Assessment Council will consider comments from thepublic, the SAB, and the Risk Assessment Forum in its recommendations tothe EPA Administrator.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE: </T2>Public comments must be postmarked by June 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Comments may be mailed or delivered to: Dr. Carole A.Kimmel, Reproductive and Developmental Toxicology Branch, Human HealthAssessment Group, Office of Health and Environmental Assessment (RD-689),U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, 401 M Street SW., Washington, DC20460.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Dr. Carole A.

Following extensive scientific and public review, final guidelineswere issued on September 24, 1986 (51 FR 33992-34054). Each of the guidelinesset forth principles and procedures to guide EPA scientists in the conductof Agency risk assessments, to help promote high scientific quality andAgency-wide consistency, and to inform Agency decision makers and the publicabout these scientific procedures. In publishing this guidance, EPA emphasized that one purpose of its riskassessment guidelines was to ``encourage research and analysis that willlead to new risk assessment methods and data,'' which in turn would beused to revise and improve the guidelines, and better guide Agency riskassessors. Thus, each of the 1986 risk assessment guidelines was developedand published with the understanding that risk assessment is an evolvingscience and that continued study could lead to changes. As expected, Agency experience with the current Guidelines for the HealthAssessment of Suspect Developmental Toxicants suggests that additionalor alternate approaches should be considered for certain aspects of theseguidelines. Proposals to amend the current guidelines were considered soonafter their publication in September 1986 because of new reviews or re-evaluationsthat focused on some of the issues identified for research in the guidelines.These included several workshops and symposia cited in the Introductionto the current guidelines. In addition, much experience has been gainedin using these guidelines and in instructing others in their use. Basedon this experience, the proposed amendments are designed to clarify certainaspects of the current guidelines, and the terminology has been updatedto be consistent with that used in other Agency guidance.As outlined below, some of the changes involve substantive revisions tothe current guidelines, while others simply clarify or reorganize currentprovisions. The remainder of the notice publishes the full text of theproposed guidelines, that is, the current guidelines as modified by theproposed amendments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Overview of Proposed Amendments</ITAG>The major proposed amendments include stronger statements concerning guidanceon evaluating maternal and developmental toxicity based on EPA's 1987 workshopon this topic, particularly about the inter-relationship between theseend points (see Reference 3 in Section VII of the proposed guidelines).A major innovation for the proposed guidelines is a weight-of-evidencescheme for developmental toxicants (Section III.D) which was developedin a 1987 EPA workshop by experts from within and outside the Agency.Lesser changes in the proposed guidelines include a change in the titlefrom ``Guidelines for the Health Assessment of Suspect Developmental Toxicants''to ``Proposed Guidelines for Developmental Toxicity Risk Assessment.''In addition, three other sections have been revised: the Human Studiessection (Section III.B) was reoriented more towards risk assessment thanstudy design; and the Dose-Response and Risk Characterization sections(Sections IV and VI) were reorganized so that information on the NOAEL/uncertaintyfactor approach and low-dose extrapolation are contained in the Dose-Responsesection (Section IV), and the margin of exposure (MOE) approach is containedin the Risk Characterization section (Section VI).One other proposed change is the introduction of the term RfD<T2>DT</T2> for the reference dose for developmental toxicity derived fromdividing the NOAEL by an uncertainty factor. This is to distinguish thedevelopmental toxicity reference dose (RfD<T2>DT</T2>), which is based on a short-term exposure as occurs in mostdevelopmental toxicity studies, from the RfD, which the Agency derivesbased on a chronic or sometimes a subchronic exposure scenario. These andother proposed changes are discussed further by section.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section I. Introduction</ITAG>This section gives the general background information on developmentaltoxicity risk assessment and the magnitude of the potential for developmentaltoxicity problems in the general population. In the current guidelines,EPA provides the general basis for the use of data from animal studiesin estimating human risk, but does not describe the assumptions generallymade in this process.The primary proposed amendment in this section is a statement of the basicassumptions made in the risk assessment process for developmental toxicity,e.g., an agent that produces an adverse developmental effect in experimentalanimal studies is assumed to pose a potential hazard to humans, and allfour possible manifestations of developmental toxicity (i.e., death, structuralabnormality, growth alteration, functional deficit) are of concern forrisk assessment. The assumption of a threshold is stated, although thisassumption is currently being discussed in the literature, as indicatedin the proposed amendments. These assumptions help to more clearly identifythe basis for the Agency's approach to risk assessment described in theproposed guidelines. In addition, some background information and referenceshave been revised. <ITAG tagnum="84">Section II. Definitions and Terminology</ITAG>This section sets forth the definitions of particular terms that are widelyused in the field of developmental toxicology. These include special termssuch as ``developmental toxicity,'' ``altered growth,'' ``malformations,''and ``variations.''The only proposed amendment in this section is the deletion of the terms``embryotoxicity'' and ``fetotoxicity.'' Because ambiguities in these termshave led to confusion and misuse, they are not used in the proposed guidelines.Thus, use of the term ``developmental toxicity,'' which is a broader term,is encouraged and ambiguities are eliminated.<ITAG tagnum="84">Section III. Hazard Identification of Developmental Toxicants</ITAG>This section describes the study designs used in animal studies and theevaluation and interpretation of end points. In the current guidelinesthe title of this section includes the term ``qualitative assessment.''Also, this section recommends that other EPA risk assessment guidelinesbe used when carcinogenic or mutagenic effects from developmental exposuresare of concern.The proposed heading for this section no longer includes the term ``qualitativeassessment,'' since hazard identification for developmental toxicity alsoincludes some evaluation of the dose-response nature of an effect. Thischange is proposed because the distinction in the current guidelines betweenqualitative and quantitative assessment has proved to be unsatisfactoryand is not made in actual practice when using the guidelines to assessdevelopmental toxicity data.The discussion of potential carcinogenic effects following developmentexposure is proposed to be expanded somewhat, as are the statements onpotential mutational events. These changes would emphasize the importanceof considering potential carcinogenic and mutagenic effects resulting fromdevelopmental exposures. More extensive information on conducting riskassessments for these types of effects is provided in the Guidelines forCarcinogen Risk Assessment (51 FR 33992) or the Guidelines for MutagenicityRisk Assessment (51 FR 34006). A. Laboratory Animal Studies of Developmental Toxicity: End Points andTheir Interpretation This section provides general information on the protocols typically usedto assess developmental toxicity. There are no proposed amendments to this section. A.l. End Points of Maternal Toxicity.This section describes the types of maternal end points evaluated in developmentaltoxicity studies and provides guidance for the hazard assessment. The proposed amendments to this section include the addition of supportfrom adverse histopathology findings to the use of alterations in organweights as a sign of maternal toxicity. This change would indicate moreclearly the basis fof the use of maternal organ changes as signs of maternaltoxicity. A.2. End Points of Developmental Toxicity. This section describes the types of developmental end points evaluatedin developmental toxicity studies and provides guidance for the hazardassessment. There are no proposed amendments to this section. A.3. Functional Developmental Toxicology. This section provides information on the state-of-the-art in the evaluationof functional effects resulting from developmental exposures. Developmentalneurotoxicity is briefly reviewed, along with other areas of functionalevaluation. Since the publication of the current guidelines in 1986, specifictesting in this area has been proposed or required by the Agency for certainagents. The proposed amendments to this section reflect the current regulatorystatus for developmental neurotoxicity testing in the Agency. The Officeof Toxic Substances (OTS) recently proposed developmental neurotoxicitytesting guidelines and finalized at least one test rule requiring suchtesting (see Reference 28 in Section VII of the proposed guidelines). Inaddition, the Science Advisory Panel for the Office of Pesticide Programs(OPP) has approved the development of testing guidelines for developmentalneurotoxicity. The proposed amendments note these activities and identifythe proposed bases for OPP and OTS requirements for such testing. A.4. Overall Evaluation of Maternal and Developmental Toxicity. This section discusses the relationship of maternal and developmental toxicityand the evaluation of developmental toxicity data in the presence of maternaltoxicity. In the current guidelines, the statement is made that developmentaleffects at maternally toxic doses should not be discounted as being secondaryto maternal toxicity. A stronger statement is proposed in this section concerning the findingof developmental toxicity in the presence of maternal toxicity, i.e., whenadverse developmental effects are produced only at maternally toxic doses,they are still considered to represent developmental toxicity and shouldnot be discounted as being secondary to maternal toxicity. Also, it isproposed that information be added on the importance of evaluating bothmaternal and developmental toxicity for the final characterization of riskas suggested by participants at the EPA-sponsored workshop on ``The Evaluationof Maternal and Developmental Toxicity.'' This would indicate that maternaltoxicity (even in the absence of developmental toxicity) is an importantend point to evaluate in the context of all available toxicity data. A.5. Short-Term Testing in Developmental Toxicity.This section summarizes in vivo and in vitro approaches to short-term testingfor developmental toxicity. In the current guidelines, the Chernoff/Kavlockassay is described, but more recent work, including a NIOSH-sponsored conferenceon this testing procedure, has appeared in the literature.The proposed amendment would update the section to include recent informationon the Chernoff/Kavlock assay, in particular, that from the NIOSH-sponsoredworkshop on ``Evaluation of the Chernoff/Kavlock Test for DevelopmentalToxicity.'' A.6. Statistical Considerations. This section describes approaches to the statistical evaluation of datafrom animal developmental toxicity studies and includes important issuesof study design that affect interpretation of data. There are no proposed amendments to this section. B. Human Studies This section describes the evaluation of human data for developmental toxiceffects. In the current guidelines, this section discusses important considerationsof study design and evaluation, but does not provide much guidance to therisk assessor on the relative importance of various types of human data.The proposed amendments would reorganize and modify this section to givemore specific information concerning the use of human data in risk assessment(e.g., greatest weight should be given to carefully designed epidemiologicstudies with more precise measures of exposure; studies with a low probabilityof biased data should carry more weight in a risk assessment). These revisionswould make this section consistent with similar sections in the ProposedGuidelines for Assessing Male Reproductive Risk and Female ReproductiveRisk. C. Other ConsiderationsThis section discusses the importance of pharmacokinetic data and structure-activityconsiderations, if available, in the risk assessment of developmental toxicants.There are no proposed amendments to this section.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Weight-of-Evidence Determination   </ITAG>This section describes the important considerations in determining therelative weight of various kinds of experimental and/or human evidencein estimating the risk of development toxicity in humans. In the currentguidelines, various factors are listed as being important, but there isno systematic procedure for categorizing the level of confidence in theavailable data.   A weight-of-evidence scheme is proposed that defines three levels of confidencefor data used to identify developmental hazards and to assess the riskof human developmental toxicity. The language used in the scheme is intentionallybroad to allow for scientific judgment in classifying data using this scheme,and classification of agents using this scheme would require experiencewith developmental toxicity data. The intent of the discussion is thatthe scheme would not be used in isolation, but would be the first stepthat must be combined with information on dose-response and exposure forthe final characterization of risk.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Dose-Response Assessment   </ITAG>This section describes the evaluation of the dose-response data from developmentaltoxicity studies. In the current guidelines, certain terminology (e.g.,NOEL, LOEL) is used in a way that is no longer consistent with its usagein other Agency guidance. In addition, certain topics (e.g., the marginof safety, now termed the margin of exposure) that are discussed as dose-responseissues in the current guidelines are treated as risk characterization issuesin other Agency guidance.   The proposed heading for this section no longer includes the term ``quantitativeassessment,'' since a sharp separation between qualitative and quantitativeassessment in the current guidelines is not made in practice. Dose-ResponseAssessment is Section IV.A. in the current guidelines.   The proposed amendments to this section incorporate terminology (e.g.,NOAEL, LOAEL, RfD) that would make the proposed guidelines consistent withother Agency guidance. The section discusses the identification of theNOAEL/LOAEL, the factors used in establishing the appropriate uncertaintyfactor, and the calculation of the RfD<T2>DT</T2>. These proposed changes would also be consistent with the wayin which chronic RfDs are calculated. However, in the proposed guidelines,the term RfD<T2>DT</T2>, based on short-term exposure, is introduced to distinguishit from the general RfD. An updated discussion of the status of mathematicalapproaches for dose-response modeling and low-dose extrapolation for developmentaltoxicity is also included.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Exposure Assessment   </ITAG>This section describes the issues of concern for developmental toxicityin the estimation of the human exposure levels. In the current guidelines,this section includes information related to human exposure-effect relationshipsthat is actually more closely related to determining dose-effect relationshipin humans.   The proposed amendments to this section, Section IV.B. in the current guidelines,include transferring some guidance from the section on determining humanexposure-effect relationships to Section IV (Dose-Response Assessment)since this discussion is more involved with dose-response assessment inhumans. The remaining information in this section focuses primarily onthe special considerations concerning exposure assessment for developmentaltoxicity. Another proposed change in this section would more clearly indicatethat since a single exposure at the critical time in development is sufficientto produce an adverse developmental effect, the human exposure estimateused to calculate the margin of exposure is usually based on a single dosethat is not adjusted for duration of exposure, and the number of exposuresis not considered important unless there is evidence for a cumulative effect.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Risk Characterization   </ITAG>This section describes the summarization of all the toxicology and exposuredata in the final stage of the risk assessment process. In the currentguidelines, this section also includes a discussion of mathematical approachesto quantitative risk assessment.   The proposed amendments to the risk characterization section, Section IV.C.in the current guidelines, include a discussion of the Margin of Exposureapproach. The discussion of dose-response models and risk extrapolationprocedures has been moved to Section IV, Dose-Response Assessment in theproposed guidelines.<ITAG tagnum="84">VII. References   </ITAG>This section includes a full list of references for the proposed guidelinesand is Section V in the current guidelines. Appropriate reference changesand additions have been made to conform to the proposed amendments.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: February 23, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John A.

References </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Proposed Guidelines for Developmental Toxicity Risk Assessment </ITAG>I. Introduction <ITAG tagnum="81">A. General </ITAG>These Proposed Guidelines for Developmental Toxicity Risk Assessment (hereafterGuidelines) describe the procedures that the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency (EPA) will follow in evaluating potential developmental toxicityassociated with human exposure to environmental toxicants. The Agency hassponsored or participated in several conferences that addressed issuesrelated to such evaluations and that provided some of the scientific basisfor these risk assessment Guidelines (1-6). The Agency's authority to regulatesubstances that have the potential to interfere adversely with human developmentis derived from a number of statutes that are implemented through multipleoffices within the EPA. The procedures described herein are intended topromote consistency across program offices within the Agency in the assessmentof developmental toxic effects. The developmental toxicity assessments prepared pursuant to these Guidelineswill be used with the requirements and constraints of the applicable statutesto arrive at regulatory decisions concerning developmental toxicity. TheseGuidelines provide a general format for analyzing and organizing the availabledata for conducting risk assessments. The Agency previously has issuedtesting guidelines (7, 8) that provide protocols designed to determinethe potential of a test substance to induce structural and/or other adverseeffects in the developing conceptus. These risk assessment Guidelines donot change any statutory or regulatory prescribed standards for the typeof data necessary for regulatory action, but rather provide guidance forthe interpretation of studies that follow the testing guidelines, and inaddition, provide limited information for the interpretation of other studies(e.g., epidemiologic data, functional developmental toxicity studies, andshort-term tests) that are not routinely required, but may be encounteredwhen reviewing data on particular agents. The National Research Council (9) has defined risk assessment as beingcomprised of some or all of the following components: hazard identification,dose-response assessment, exposure assessment, and risk characterization.In general, the process of assessing the risk of human developmental toxicitymay be adapted to this format. However, the components of this format shouldnot be considered in isolation. Instead, an appreciation of the potentialfor risk and the consequences of exposure can come only from considerationof the integration of all four components. Each component contributes tothe final assessment of risk.Hazard identification involves the evaluation of all available experimentalanimal and human data to determine if an agent is likely to cause developmentaltoxicity. In considering developmental toxicity, these Guidelines willaddress not only structural abnormalities, but also fetal and neonataldeath, growth alteration, and functional abnormalities that may resultfrom developmental exposure to environmental agents.The dose-response assessment defines the relationship of the dose of anagent to the occurrence of developmentally toxic effects. According tothe National Research Council (9), this component would usually includeextrapolation from high to low doses and from experimental animals to humans.Since at present there are no mathematical extrapolation models that aregenerally accepted for developmental toxicity, uncertainty factors areapplied to the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) to derive a referencedose for developmental toxicity (RfD<T2>DT</T2>). The RfD<T2>DT</T2> is based on a short duration of exposure as is typically usedin developmental toxicity studies in experimental animals. The use of theterm RfD<T2>DT</T2> distinguishes it from the reference dose (RfD) which refersto chronic exposure situations (10). This approach is discussed furtherin these Guidelines (Section IV). Potential mathematical models are beingevaluated by the Agency for application to data in this area (5).The exposure assessment identifies populations exposed to an agent, describestheir composition and size, and presents the types, magnitudes, frequencies,and durations of exposure to the agent. The exposure assessment providesan estimate of human exposure levels from all potential sources.In risk characterization, the exposure assessment and the hazard identificationand dose-response assessment are combined to estimate some measure of therisk of developmental toxicity. Here the NOAEL and the estimated humanexposure levels may be compared to provide a margin of exposure (MOE).As part of risk characterization, a summary of the strengths and weaknessesin each component of the risk assessment are presented along with majorassumptions, scientific judgments, and, to the extent possible, qualitativeand quantitative estimates of the uncertainties. The weight-of-evidencedetermination should always be presented in conjunction with informationon dose-response and, if available, the human exposure estimate.Risk assessment is just one component of the regulatory process and definesthe adverse health consequences of exposure to a toxic agent. The othercomponent, risk management, combines the risk assessment with the directivesof the enabling regulatory legislation, together with socioeconomic, technical,political, and other considerations, to reach a decision as to whetherto control future exposure to the suspected toxic agent and, if so, thelevel of control. The acceptability of the uncertainty factor or the marginof exposure and risk management decisions, but the scientific bases forestablishing these values are discussed here.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Background</ITAG>The background incidence of developmental defects in the human populationis quite large. For example, Hertig (11) estimated that approximately 50%of human conceptuses fail to reach term; Wilcox (12), using biochemicaltechniques for detecting pregnancy as early as 9 days postconception, observedthat 35% of pregnancies ended in an embryonic or fetal loss. Approximately3% of newborn children are found to have one or more significant congenitalmalformations at birth, and by the end of the first postnatal year, about3% more are found to have serious developmental defects (13). Of these,it is estimated that 20% are of known genetic transmission, 10% are attributableto known environmental factors, and the remainder result from unknown causes(14). Also, approximately 7.4% of children are reduced in weight at birth(i.e., below 2500 g) (15).Close to one-half of the children in hospital wards are there because ofprenatally acquired malformations (16). The Centers for Disease Controlrecently evaluated the enormity of the problem of developmental disabilitiesin the United States. Among all races, congenital anomalies, sudden infantdeath syndrome, and prematurity combined account for more than 50% of infantmortality in the United States (17). In addition, among the leading causesof estimated years of potential life lost (YPLL) before the age of 65,congenital anomalies ranks fifth, prematurity ranks sixth, and sudden infantdeath syndrome ranks seventh (18). The YPLL estimates may actually underestimatethe public health impact of congenital anomalies because statistics onthe following may not be represented (19): (1) Anomalies in infants whodie shortly after birth may not be diagnosed and death may not be attributedto congenital anomalies; (2) YPLL estimates are based only on live birthsand therefore do not take into account the number of fetuses with anomaliesthat were spontaneously aborted or infants that were stillborn; (3) withprenatal diagnoses of chromosomal abnormalities and neural tube defects,pregnancies may be terminated and thus these statistics are not representedin the YPLL estimates.Exposure to agents affecting development can result in any one or moreof four possible manifestations (death, structural abnormality, growthalteration, and/or functional deficit). Therefore, assessment efforts shouldencompass a wide array of adverse developmental end points, such as spontaneousabortions, stillbirths, malformations, early postnatal mortality, reducedbirth weight, and other adverse functional or physical changes that aremanifested postnatally.Numerous agents have been shown to be developmental toxicants in animaltest systems (16). Several of them have also been shown to be the causeof adverse developmental effects in humans, including alcohol, aminopterin,busulfan, chlorobiphenyls, diethylstilbestrol, isotretinoin, lead, organicmercury, thalidomide, and valproic acid (13, 20, 21). Although a numberof agents found to be developmental toxicants in experimental animal studieshave not shown clear evidence of hazard in humans, the available humandata are inadequate to determine a cause and effect relationship. Comparisonsof human and experimental animal data have been made for a limited numberof agents that are human developmental toxicants (22-24). In these comparisons,there was almost always qualitative concordance of effects between humansand at least one species tested; also, the minimally effective dose (MED)for the most sensitive animal species was approximately 0.5 to 100 timesthe human MED, not accounting for differences in the incidence of effectat the MED. Thus, there is some basis for estimating the risk of exposureto human development based on data from animal studies.However, there are a number of unknowns in the extrapolation of data fromanimal studies to humans. Therefore, a number of assumptions must be madewhich are generally applied. These assumptions are the bases for the approachestaken to risk assessment in these Guidelines.First, an agent that produces an adverse developmental effect in experimentalanimal studies is assumed to pose a potential hazard to humans followingexposure during development. This assumption is based on the comparisonsof data for known human developmental toxicants (22-24). In almost allcases, the experimental animal data would have predicted a developmentaleffect in humans.It is assumed that all of the four manifestations of developmental toxicity(death, structural abnormalities, growth alterations, and functional deficits)are of concern. In the past, there has been a tendency to consider onlymalformations or malformations and death as end points of concern. Fromthe data on agents that are known human developmental toxicants (22-24),there is usually at least one experimental species that mimics the typesof effects seen in humans, but in other species tested, the type of developmentalperturbation may be different. Thus, the appearance of any of the fourmanifestations is considered indicative of an agent's potential for disruptingdevelopment and producing a developmental hazard.It is assumed that the types of developmental effects seen in animal studiesare not necessarily the same as those that may be produced in humans. Thisassumption is made because it is impossible to determine which will bethe most appropriate species in terms of predicting the specific typesof effects seen in humans. The fact that every species may not react inthe same way is probably due to species_specific differences in criticalperiods, metabolism, developmental patterns, or mechanisms of action.It is assumed that the most sensitive species should be used to estimatehuman risk. When data are available (e.g., pharmacokinetic, metabolic)to suggest the most appropriate species, that species will be used forextrapolation. In the absence of such data, the most sensitive speciesis used, based on the fact that for the majority of known human developmentaltoxicants, humans are as sensitive or more so than the most sensitive animalspecies (22-24).In general, a threshold is assumed for the dose-response curve for mostdevelopmental toxicants. This is based on the known capacity of the developingorganism to compensate for or to repair a certain amount of damage at thecellular, tissue, or organ level. In addition, because of the multipotencyof cells at certain stages of development, multiple insults at the molecularor cellular level may be required to produce an effect on the whole organism.There are uncertainties concerning this assumption that are being discussedcurrently in the literature (25, 26).II. Definitions and TerminologyThe Agency recognizes that there are differences in the use of terms inthe field of developmental toxicology. For the purposes of these Guidelinesthe following definitions and terminology will be used.Developmental toxicology. The study of adverse effects on the developingorganism that may result from exposure prior to conception (either parent),during prenatal development, or postnatally to the time of sexual maturation.Adverse developmental effects may be detected at any point in the lifespan of the organism. The major manifestations of developmental toxicityinclude: (1) Death of the developing organism, (2) structural abnormality,(3) altered growth, and (4) functional deficiency.Altered Growth. An alteration in offspring organ or body weight or size.Changes in one end point may or may not be accompanied by other signs ofaltered growth (e.g., changes in body weight may or may not be accompaniedby changes in crown-rump length and/or skeletal ossification). Alteredgrowth can be induced at any stage of development, may be reversible, ormay result in a permanent change.Functional Developmental Toxicology. The study of alterations or delaysin functional competence of the organism or organ system following exposureto an agent during critical periods of development pre- and/or postnatally.Malformations and Variations. A malformation is usually defined as a permanentstructural change that may adversely affect survival, development, or function.The term teratogenicity, which is used to describe these types of structuralabnormalities, will be used in these Guidelines to refer only to structuraldefects. A variation is used to indicate a divergence beyond the usualrange of structural constitution that may not adversely affect survivalor health. Distinguishing between variations and malformations is difficultsince there exists a continuum of responses from the normal to the extremedeviant. There is no generally accepted classification of malformationsand variations. Other terminology that is often used, but no better defined,includes anomalies, deformations, and aberrations.III. Hazard Identification of Developmental ToxicantsDevelopmental toxicity is expressed as one or more of a number of possibleend points that may be used for evaluating the potential of an agent tocause abnormal development. The four types of effects on the conceptusthat may be produced by developmental exposure to toxicants include death,structural abnormality, altered growth, and functional deficits. Of these,all four types of effects have been evaluated in human studies, but onlythe first three are traditionally measured in laboratory animals usingthe conventional developmental toxicity (also called teratogenicity orSegment II) testing protocol as well as in other study protocols, suchas the multigeneration study. Although functional deficits have been shownto occur subsequent to developmental exposures in humans, such effectsseldom have been evaluated in routine testing studies in experimental animals.However, functional evaluations are beginning to be examined under certainregulatory situations (27, 28).Carcinogenic effects of developmental exposures have occurred in humansresulting from the use of diethylstilbestrol for the maintenance of pregnancy(29). Several agents have been shown to cause cancer following developmentalexposures in experimental animals, and it appears from the data collectedthus far that agents which are capable of causing cancer in adults mayalso cause transplacental or neonatal carcinogenesis (30). There is noway to predict whether adults or developing animals will be more sensitiveto the carcinogenic effects of an agent. At present, testing for carcinogenesisfollowing developmental exposure is not routinely required. However, ifthis type of effect is reported for an agent, it is considered appropriateto use the Guidelines for Carcinogen Risk Assessment (31) for assessinghuman risk. Mutational events also may occur as a result of exposure todevelopmental toxicants but may be difficult to discriminate from otherpossible mechanisms in standard studies of developmental toxicity. Whenmutational events are suspected from further experiments, the Guidelinesfor Mutagenicity Risk Assessment (32) should be consulted; however, theseguidelines specifically address heritable and not somatic mutational risk.<ITAG tagnum="81">A. Laboratory Animal Studies of Developmental Toxicity: End Pointsand Their Interpretation</ITAG>This section will discuss the end points examined in routinely-used protocolsas well as the use of other types of studies, including functional studiesand short-term tests.The most commonly used protocol for assessing developmental toxicity inlaboratory animals involves the administration of a test substance to pregnantanimals (usually mice, rats, or rabbits) during the period of major organogenesis,evaluation of maternal responses throughout pregnancy, and examinationof the dam and the uterine contents just prior to term (7, 8, 33-35). Otherprotocols may use exposures of one to a few days to investigate periodsof particular sensitivity for induction of anomalies in specific organsor organ systems (36). In addition, developmental toxicity may be evaluatedin studies involving exposure of one or both parents prior to conception,of the conceptus during pregnancy and over several generations, or of offspringduring the late prenatal and early postnatal periods (7, 8, 27, 28, 33-35,37). These Guidelines are intended to provide information for interpretingdevelopmental effects related to any of these types of exposure. Sincemany of the end points evaluated also are related to effects on the parentalreproductive systems, these Guidelines should be used in conjunction withthose published on assessing male and female reproductive risk (38, 39).Study designs should include, at a minimum, a high dose, a low dose, andone intermediate dose. The high dose should produce some maternal or adulttoxicity (i.e., a level which at the least produces marginal but significantlyreduced body weight, weight gain, or specific organ toxicity, and at themost produces no more than 10% mortality). The low dose should demonstratea NOAEL for adult and offspring effects. A concurrent control group treatedwith the vehicle used for agent administration should be included. Theroute of exposure is usually oral, although data from other routes maysometimes be useful, especially if supported by pharmacokinetic information.Test animals should be selected based on considerations of species, strain,age, weight, and health status, and should be randomized to dose groupsin order to reduce bias and provide a basis for performing valid statisticaltests.The next three sections discuss individual end points of maternal and developmentaltoxicity as measured in the conventional developmental toxicity study andthe multigeneration study, and, on occasion, in postnatal studies. Otherend points specifically related to reproductive toxicity are covered inthe relevant risk assessment guidelines (38, 39). The fourth section dealswith the integrated evaluation of all data, including the relative effectsof exposure on maternal animals and their offspring, which is importantin assessing the level of concern about a particular agent. It should benoted that appropriate historical control data can be helpful in the interpretationof end points of maternal and developmental toxicity.1. <T3>End Points of Maternal Toxicity. </T3>A number of end points that maybe observed as possible indicators of maternal toxicity are listed in Table1. Maternal mortality is an obvious end point of toxicity; however, a numberof other end points can be observed which may give an indication of thesubtle effects of an agent. For example, in well-conducted studies, thefertility and gestation indices provide information on the general fertilityrate of the animal stock used and are important indicators of toxic effectsto adults if treatment begins prior to mating or implantation. Changesin gestation length may indicate effects on the process of parturition.<ITAG tagnum="81">Table 1.

Body weight changesmay provide more information than a daily body weight measured during treatmentor during gestation. Changes in weight gain during treatment could occurthat would not be reflected in the total weight change throughout gestation,because of compensatory weight gain that may occur following treatmentbut before sacrifice. For this reason, changes in weight gain during treatmentcan be examined as another indicator or maternal toxicity. Changes in maternal body weight corrected for gravid uterine weight atsacrifice may indicate whether the effect is primarily maternal or fetal.For example, there may be a significant reduction in weight gain throughoutgestation and in gravid uterine weight, but no change in corrected maternalweight gain which would generally indicate an intrauterine effect. Conversely,a change in corrected weight gain and no change in gravid uterine weightgenerally suggests maternal toxicity and little or not intrauterine effect.An alternate estimate of maternal weight change during gestation can beobtained by subtracting the sum of the weights of the fetuses. However,this weight does not include the uterine tissue, placental tissue, or theamniotic fluid. Changes in other end points may also be important. For example, changesin relative and absolute organ weights may be signs of a maternal effectwhen an agent is suspected or causing specific organ toxicity and whensuch findings are supported by adverse histopathologic findings in thoseorgans. Food and water consumption data are useful, especially if the agentis administered in the diet or drinking water. The amount ingested (totaland relative to body weight) and the dose of the agent (relative to bodyweight) can then be calculated, and changes in food and water consumptionrelated to treatment can be evaluated along with changes in body weightand body weight gain. Data on food and water consumption are also usefulwhen an agent is suspected of affecting appetite, water intake, or excretoryfunction. Clinical evaluations of toxicity may also be used as indicatorsof maternal toxicity. Daily clinical observations may be useful describingthe profile or maternal toxicity. Enzyme markers and clinical chemistriesmay be useful indicators of exposure but must be interpreted carefullyas to whether or not a change constitutes toxicity. Gross necropsy andhistopathology data (when specified in the protocol) may aid in determiningtoxic dose levels. The minimum amount of information/data considered usefulfor evaluating maternal toxicity [as noted in the Proceedings of the Workshopon the Evaluation of Maternal and Developmental Toxicity (3)], includes:morbidity or mortality; maternal body weight and body weight gain; clinicalsigns of toxicity; food (and water, if dosing is via drinking water) consumption;and necropsy for gross evidence of organ toxicity. Maternal toxicity shouldbe determined in the pregnant and/or lactating animal over an appropriatepart of gestation and/or the neonatal period, and should not be assumedor extrapolated from other adult toxicity studies. 2. <T3>End Points of Developmental Toxicity. </T3>Because the maternal animal,and not the conceptus, is the individual treated during gestation, datagenerally should be calculated as incidence per litter or as number andpercent of litters with particular end points. Table 2 indicates the wayin which offspring and litter end points may be expressed. <ITAG tagnum="81">Table 2.

The end points examined depend on the protocol used foreach study.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">c Measured at selected intervals until termination of the study.</ITAG>When treatment begins prior to implantation, an increase in preimplantationloss could indicate an adverse effect on the fertilization process, ovumtransport, uterine toxicity, the developing blastocyst, or on the processof implantation itself. If treatment begins around the time of implantation(i.e., day 6 of gestation in the mouse, rat, or rabbit), an increase inpreimplantation loss probably reflects normal variability in the animalsbeing used, but the data should be examined carefully to determine whetheror not the effect is dose related. If preimplantation loss is related todose in either case, further studies would be necessary to determine themechanism and extent of such effects.The number and percent of live offspring per litter, based on all litters,may include litters that have no live implants. Resorptions and late fetaldeaths give some indication of when the conceptus died, and the numberand percent nonlive implants per litter (post-implantation loss) is a combinationof resorptions and late fetal deaths. The number and percent of littersshowing an increased incidence for these end points is generally usefulbut may be less useful than incidence per litter because, in the formercase, a litter is counted whether it has one or all resorbed, dead, ornonlive implants.If a significant increase in postimplantation loss is found after exposureto an agent, the data may be compared not only with concurrent controls,but also with recent historical control data, since there is considerableinterlitter variability in the incidence of post-implantation loss (40).If a given study control group exhibits an unusually high or low incidenceof postimplantation loss compared to historical controls, then scientificjudgment must be used to determine the adequacy of the study for risk assessmentpurposes.The end point for affected implants (i.e., the combination of nonlive andmalformed conceptuses) gives an indication of the total intrauterine responseto an agent and sometimes reflects a better dose-response relationshipthan does the incidence of nonlive or malformed offspring taken individually.This is especially true at the high end of the dose-response curve in caseswhen the incidence of nonlive implants per litter is greatly increased.In such cases, the malformation rate may appear to decrease because onlyunaffected offspring have survived. If the incidence of prenatal deathor malformation is unchanged, then the incidence of affected implants willnot provide any additional dose-response information. In studies wherematernal animals are allowed to deliver pups normally, the number of stillbirthsper litter should also be noted.The number of live offspring per litter, based on those litters that haveone or more live offspring, may be unchanged even though the incidenceof nonlive in all litters is increased. This could occur either becauseof an increase in the number of litters with no live offspring, or an increasein the number of implants per litter. A decrease in the number of liveoffspring per litter should be accompanied by an increase in the incidenceof nonlive implants per litter unless the implant numbers differ amongdose groups. In postnatal studies, the viability of live born offspringshould be determined at selected intervals until termination of the study.The sex ratio per litter, as well as the body weights of males and females,can be examined to determine whether or not one sex is preferentially affectedby the agent. However, this is an annual occurrence.A change in offspring body weight is a sensitive indicator of developmentaltoxicity, in part because it is a continuous variable. In some cases, offspringweight reduction may be the only indicator of developmental toxicity. Whilethere is always a question remaining as to whether weight reduction isa permanent or transitory effect, little is known about the long-term consequencesof short-term fetal or neonatal weight changes. Therefore, weight reductionshould be used to establish the NOAEL. There are other factors that shouldbe considered in the evaluation of fetal or neonatal weight changes. Forexample, in polytocous animals, fetal and neonatal weights are usuallyinversely correlated with litter size, and the upper end of the dose-responsecurve may be confounded by smaller litters and increased fetal or neonatalweight. Additionally, the average body weight of males is greater thanthat of females in the more commonly used laboratory animals.Live offspring should be examined for external, visceral, and skeletalmalformations. If only a portion of the litter is examined, then it ispreferable that those examined be randomly selected from each litter. Anincrease in the incidence of malformed offspring may be indicated by achange in one or more of the following end points: the incidence of malformedoffspring per litter, the number and percent of litters with malformedoffspring, or the number of offspring or litters with a particular malformationthat appears to increase with dose (as indicated by the incidence of individualtypes of malformations).Other ways of examining the data include the incidence of external, visceral,and skeletal malformations which may indicate the general systems affected.A listing of individual offspring with their malformations and variationsmay give an indication of the pattern of developmental deviations. Allof these methods of expressing and examining the data are valid for determiningthe effects of an agent on structural development. However, care must betaken to avoid counting offspring more than once in evaluating any singleend point based on number or percent of offspring or litters. The incidenceof individual types of malformations and variations should be examinedfor significant changes which may be masked if the data on all malformationsand variations are pooled. Appropriate historical control data are helpfulin the interpretation of malformations and variations, especially thosethat normally occur at a low incidence and may or may not be related todose in an individual study. Although a dose-related increase in malformationsis interpreted as an adverse developmental effect of exposure to an agent,the significance of anatomical variations is more difficult to determine,and must take into account what is known about developmental stage (e.g.,with skeletal ossification), background incidence of certain variations(e.g., 12 or 13 pairs of ribs in rabbits), or other strain- or species-specificfactors. However, if variations are significantly increased in a dose-relatedmanner, these should also be evaluated as a possible indication of developmentaltoxicity. The Interagency Regulatory Liaison Group noted that dose-relatedincreases in defects that may occur spontaneously are as relevant as dose-relatedincreases in any other developmental toxicity end points (41).3. <T3>Functional Developmental Toxicology.</T3> Developmental effects thatare induced by exogenous agents are not limited to death, structural abnormalities,and altered growth. Rather, it has been demonstrated in a number of instancesthat subtle alterations in the functional competence of an organ or a varietyof organ systems may result from exposure during critical developmentalperiods that may occur between conception and sexual maturation. Often,these functional defects are observed at dose levels below those at whichgross malformations are evident (42). Such testing has not been routinelyrequired in the United States, but studies are beginning to be requiredwhen other information indicates the potential for adverse functional effects(27, 28). Data from postnatal studies, when available, are considered veryuseful for the assessment of the relative importance and severity of findingsin the fetus and neonate. Often, the long-term consequences of adversedevelopmental outcomes noted at birth are unknown, and further data onpostnatal development and function are needed to determine the full spectrumof potential developmental effects. In some cases, useful data can be derivedfrom well-executed multigeneration studies.Much of the early work in functional developmental toxicology was relatedto behavioral evaluations, and the term ``behavioral teratology'' becameprominent in the mid 1970s. Recent advances in this area have been reviewedin several publications (43, 44). Several expert groups have focused onthe functions that should be included in a behavioral testing battery (45-47),and these include: sensory systems, neuromotor development, locomotor activity,learning and memory, reactivity and/or habituation, and reproductive behavior.No testing battery has adequately addressed all of these functions, butit is important to include as many as possible. Several testing batterieshave been developed and evaluated (46, 48, 49). The U.S. EPA Office ofToxic Substances (OTS) has developed a guideline for developmental neurotoxicitytesting (28) that includes some evaluation of all the categories listedabove except for reproductive behavior, and also includes requirementsfor brain weights and neuropathology. Several criteria for selecting agentsfor developmental neurotoxicity testing have been suggested (46), including:agents that cause central nervous system malformations, pyschoactive drugsand chemicals, adult neurotoxicants, hormonally-active agents, and chemicalsthat are structurally related to other developmental neurotoxicants. Datafrom developmental neurotoxicity studies should be evaluated in light ofthe data that may have triggered such testing as well as all other toxicitydata available.Less work has been done on other developing functional systems, but datahave accumulated to indicate that the cardiopulmonary, immune, endocrine,digestive, and urinary systems, as well as the central nervous system aresubject to alterations in functional competence (50, 51) following exposureduring development. Currently, there are no standard testing proceduresfor these functional systems. However, when data are encountered on a chemicalunder review, they are considered and evaluated in the risk assessmentprocess.Extrapolation of functional developmental effects to humans is limitedby the lack of knowledge about underlying toxicological mechanisms andtheir significance as is true for other end points of developmental toxicity.In comparisons made on a limited number of agents known to cause developmentalneurotoxic effects in humans (52), these agents also have been shown toproduce developmental neurotoxic effects in animal species. As for otherend points of developmental toxicity, the assumption is made that functionaleffects in animal studies indicate the potential for altered developmentin humans. When data from functional developmental toxicity studies areencountered for particular agents, they should be evaluated and includedin the risk assessment process.Some guidance is provided here concerning important general concepts ofstudy design and evaluation for functional developmental toxicity studies.andbullet; Several aspects of study design are similar to those importantin standard developmental toxicity studies (e.g., a dose-response approachwith the highest dose producing minimal overt maternal or perinatal toxicity,number of litters large enough for adequate statistical power, randomizationof animals to dose groups and test groups, litter generally consideredthe statistical unit, etc.).andbullet; A replicate study design provides added confidence in the interpretationof data.andbullet; Use of a pharmacological challenge may be valuable in evaluatingfunction and ``unmasking'' effects not othewise detectable, particularlyin the case of organ systems that are endowed with a reasonable degreeof functional reserve capacity.andbullet; Use of functional tests with a moderate degree of background variabilitymay be more sensitive to the effects of an agent than are tests with lowvariability that may be impossible to disrupt without being life-threatening.Butcher et al. (53) discussed this with relation to behavioral end points.andbullet; A battery of functional tests, in contrast to a single test, usuallyprovides a more thorough evaluation of the functioanl competence of ananimal; tests conducted at several ages may provide more information aboutmaturational changes and their persistence.andbullet; Critical periods for the disruption of functional competence includeboth the prenatal and the postnatal periods to the time of sexual maturation,and the effect is likely to vary depending on the time and degree of exposure.Although interpretation of functional data may be limited at present, itis clear that functional effects must be evaluated in light of other toxicitydata, including other forms of developmental toxicity (e.g., structuralabnormalities, perinatal death, and growth retardation). The level of confidencein an adverse effect may be more important than the type of change seen,and confidence may be increased by such factors as replicability of theeffect either in another study of the same function or by convergence ofdata from tests that purport to measure similar functions. A dose-responserelationship is considered an important measure of chemical effect; inthe case of functional effects, both monotonic and biphasic dose-responsecurves are likely, and both may be appropriate depending on the functionbeing tested. Finally, there are at least three general ways in which thedata from these studies may be useful for risk assessment purposes: (1)To help elucidate the long-term consequences of fetal and neonatal findings;(2) to indicate the potential for an agent to cause functional alterationsand the effective doses relative to those that produce other forms of toxicity;and (3) for existing environmental agents, to suggest organ systems tobe evaluated in exposed human populations.4. <T3>Overall Evaluation of Maternal and Developmental Toxicity.</T3> As discussed previously, individual end points of maternal and developmentaltoxicity are evaluated in developmental toxicity studies. In order to interpretthe data fully, an integrated evaluation must be performed consideringall maternal and developmental end points.Those agents that produce developmental toxicity at a dose that is nottoxic to the maternal animal are of greatest concern because the developingorganism appears to be more sensitive than the adult. However, when adversedevelopmental effects are produced only at minimal maternally toxic doses,they are still considered to represent developmental toxicity and shouldnot be discounted as being secondary to maternal toxicity. Current informationis inadequate to assume that developmental effects at maternally toxicdoses result only from maternal toxicity; rather, when the lowest observedadverse effect level (LOAEL) is the same for the adult and developing organisms,it may simply indicate that both are sensitive to that dose level. Moreover,the maternal effects may be reversible while effects on the offspring maybe permanent. These are important considerations for agents to which humansmay be exposed at minimally toxic levels either voluntarily or in the workplace,since several agents are known to produce adverse developmental effectsat minimally toxic doses in adult humans (e.g., smoking, alcohol).Since the final risk assessment not only takes into account the potentialhazard of an agent, but also the nature of the dose-response relationship,it is important that the relationship of maternal and developmental toxicitybe evaluated and described. Then, information from the exposure assessmentis used to determine the likelihood of exposure to levels near the maternallytoxic dose for each agent and the risk for developmental toxicity in humans.If, on the other hand, maternal toxicity is seen in the absence of or atdose levels lower than those producing developmental toxicity, and if theeffect level is lower than that in evaluations of other types of adulttoxicity, this implies that the pregnant female is likely to be more sensitivethan the nonpregnant female and the data from the pregnant female shouldbe used to assess risk. Although the evaluation of developmental toxicityis the primary objective of standard studies within this area, maternaleffects seen within the context of developmental toxicity studies shouldbe evaluated as part of the overall toxicity profile for a given chemical.Approaches for ranking agents according to their relative maternal anddevelopmental toxicity have been proposed; Schardein (20) has reviewedseveral of these. Several approaches involve the calculation of ratiosrelating an adult toxic dose to a developmentally toxic dose (54-57). Suchratios may describe in a qualitative and roughly quantitative fashion therelationship of maternal (adult) and developmental toxicity. However, atthe U.S. EPA Sponsored Workshop on the Evaluation of Maternal and DevelopmentalToxicity (3), there was no agreement as to the validity or utility of theseapproaches in other aspects of the risk assessment process. This is inpart due to uncertainty about factors that can affect the ratios. For example,the number and spacing of dose levels, differences in study design (e.g.,route an/or timing of exposure), and species differences in response (3,58), can influence the maternal and developmental effects and the resultingratios. Also, the end points used in the ratios need to be better definedto permit cross-species comparison. Until such information is available,the applicability of these approaches in risk assessment is not justified.5. <T3>Short-term Testing in Developmental Toxicity</T3>. The need for short-termtests for developmental toxicity has arisen from the need to establishtesting priorities for the large number of agents in or entering the environment,the interest in reducing the number of animals used for routine testing,and the expense of testing. Two approaches are considered here in termsof their contribution to the overall testing process: 1) an in vivo mammalianscreen, and 2) a variety of in vitro systems. Currently, neither approachis considered as a replacement for routine in vivo development toxicitytesting in experimental animals, and should not be used to make the finaldecision as to an agent's developmental toxicity. Rather, such tests maybe useful in making preliminary evaluations of developmental toxicity,for evaluating structure-activity relationships, and for assigning prioritiesfor further, more extensive testing. Although such short-term tests arenot routinely required, data sometimes are encountered in the review ofchemicals; the comments are provided here for guidance in the evaluationof such data.<T3>a. In vivo mamalian developmental toxicity screen. </T3>The most widelystudied in vivo short-term approach is that developed by Chernoff and Kavlock(59). This approach is based on the hypothesis that a prenatal injury,which results in altered development, will be manifested postnatally asreduced viability and/or impaired growth. When originally proposed, thetest substance was administered to mice over the period of major organogenesisat a single dose level that would elicit some degree of maternal toxicity.At the NIOSH Workshop on the Evaluation of the Chernoff/Kavlock Test forDevelopmental Toxicity (4), use of a second lower dose level was encouragedto potentially reduce the chances of false positive results, and the recordingof implantation sites was recommended to provide a more precise estimateof postimplantation loss (60).In this approach, the pups are counted and weighed shortly after birth,and again after 3-4 days. End points that are considered in the evaluationinclude: general maternal toxicity (including survival and weight gain),litter size, and viability, weight, and gross malformations in the offspring.Basic priority-setting categories for more extensive testing have beensuggested: 1) agents that induce perinatal death should receive highestpriority, 2) agents that induce perinatal weight changes should be rankedlower in priority, and 3) agents that induce no effect should receive thelowest priority (59). Another scheme that has been proposed applies a numericalranking to the results as a means of prioritizing agents for further testing(61, 62).The mouse was chosen originally for this test because of its low cost,but the procedure has been applied to the rat as well (63). The test willpredict the potential for developmental toxicity of an agent in the speciesused while extrapolation of risk to other species, including humans, hasthe same limitations as for other testing protocols. The EPA Office ofToxic Substances has developed testing guidelines for this procedure (64).Although the testing guidelines are available, such procedures are requiredon a case-by-case basis. Application of this procedure in the risk assessmentprocess within the Office of Toxic Substances has been described (65),and the experiences of a number of laboratories are detailed in the proceedingsof the NIOSH workshop (4).<T3>b. In vitro developmental toxicity screens. </T3>Test systems thatfall under the general heading of ``in vitro'' developmental toxicity screensinclude any system that employs a test subject other than the intact pregnantmammal. Examples of such systems include: Isolated whole mammalian embryosin culture, tissue/organ culture, cell culture, and developing nonmammalianorganisms. These systems have long been used to assess events associatedwith normal and abnormal development, but only recently have they beenconsidered for this potential as screens in testing (66-68). Many of thesesystems are now being evaluated for their ability to predict the developmentaltoxicity of various agents in intact mammalian systems. This validationprocess requires certain considerations in study design, including definedend points for toxicity and an understanding of the system's ability tohandle various test agents (67, 69-71).6. <T3>Statistical Considerations</T3>. In the assessment of developmentaltoxicity data, statistical considerations require special attention. Sincethe litter is generally considered the experimental unit in most developmentaltoxicity studies, the statistical analyses should be designed to analyzethe relevant data based on incidence per litter or on the number of litterswith a particular end point. The analytical procedures used and the results,as well as an indication of the variance in each end point, should be clearlyindicated in the presentation of data. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) techniques,with litter nested within dose in the model, take the litter variable intoaccount while allowing use of individual offspring data and an evaluationof both within and between litter variance as well as dose effects. Nonparametricand categorical procedures have also been widely used for binomial or incidencedata. In addition, tests for dose-response trends can be applied. Althougha single statistical approach has not been agreed upon, a number of factorsimportant in the analysis of developmental toxicity data have been discussed(41, 72).Studies that employ a replicate experimental design (e.g., two or threereplicates with 10 litters per dose per replicate rather than a singleexperiment with 20 to 30 litters per dose group) allow for broader interpretationof study results since the variability between replicates can be accountedfor using ANOVA techniques. Replication of effects due to a given agentwithin a study, as well as among studies or laboratories, provides addedstrength in the use of data for the estimation of risk.An important factor to determine in evaluating data is the power of a study(i.e., the probability that a study will demonstrate a true effect), whichis limited by the sample size used in the study, the background incidenceof the end point observed, the variability in the incidence of the endpoint, and the analysis method. As an example, Nelson and Holson (73) haveshown that the number of litters needed to detect a 5% or 10% change wasdramatically lower for fetal weight (a continuous variable with low variability)than for resorptions (a binomial response with high variability). Withthe current recommendation in testing protocols being 20 rodents per dosegroup (7, 8), it is possible to detect an increased incidence of malformationsin the range of 5 to 12 times above control levels, an increase of 3 to6 times the in utero death rate, and a decrease of 0.15 to 0.25 times thefetal weight. Thus, even within the same study, the ability to detect achange in fetal weight is much greater than for the other end points measured.Consequently, for statistical reasons only, changes in fetal weight areoften observable at doses below those producing other signs of developmentaltoxicity. Any risk assessment should present the detection sensitivityfor the study design used and for the end point(s) evaluated.Although statistical analyses are important in determining the effectsof a particular agent, the biological significance of data should not beoverlooked. For example, with the number of end points that can be observedin developmental toxicity studies, a few statistically significant differencesmay occur by chance. On the other hand, apparent trends with dose may bebiologically relevant even though statistical analyses do not indicatea significant effect. This may be true especially for the incidence ofmalformations or in utero death where a relatively large difference isrequired to be statistically significant. It should be apparent from thisdiscussion that a great deal of scientific judgment, based on experiencewith developmental toxicity data and with principles of experimental designand statistical analysis, may be required to adequately evaluate such data.<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Human Studies</ITAG>The category of ``human studies'' includes both epidemiologic studies andother reports of individual cases or clusters of events. Reports of individualcases or clusters of events may generate hypotheses of exposure-outcomeassociations, but require further confirmation with well-designed epidemiologicor laboratory studies. These reports of cases or clusters may give addedsupport to associations suggested by other human or animal data, but cannotstand by themselves in risk assessments. Greatest weight should be givento carefully-designed epidemiologic studies with more precise measuresof exposure, since they can best evaluate exposure-response relationships(see section IV). Epidemiologic studies in which exposure is presumed basedon occupational title or residence (e.g., some case-control and all ecologicstudies) may contribute data to qualitative risk assessments, but are oflimited use for quantitative risk assessments because of the generallybroad categorical groupings. Risk assessors should seek the assistanceof professionals trained in epidemiology when conducting a detailed analysis.1. <T3>Examination of Clusters, Case Reports, or Case Series</T3>. The identificationof cases or clusters of adverse developmental effects is generally limitedto those identified by the women involved, or clinically by their physicians.Examples of outcomes more easily identified include fetal loss in mid tolate pregnancy or congenital malformations. Identification of other effects,such as embryonic loss may be difficult to separate from subfertility/infertility.Identification of such ``non-events'' (e.g., lack of pregnancies or children)are much harder to recognize than are developmental effects such as malformationsresulting from in utero exposure. While case reports may have importancein the recognition of developmental toxicants, they may be of greatestuse in suggesting topics for further investigation (74).2. <T3>Epidemiologic Studies</T3>. Good epidemiologic studies provide themost relevant information for assessing human risk. As there are many differentdesigns for epidemiologic studies, simple rules for their evalution donot exist. The following is a discussion of factors that affect the relativeweight assigned a particular study in a risk assessment.a. General design considerations. Factors that affect a study's usefulnessfor risk assessment include the power of the study, potential bias in datacollection, control of potential risk factors, effect modifiers and confounders,and statistical factors (41, 75-80):(1) The power of the study: The power, or ability of a study to detecta true effect, is dependent on the size of the study group, the frequencyof the outcome in the general population, and the level of excess riskto be identified. In a cohort study, common outcomes, such as recognizedembryo/fetal loss, require hundreds of pregnancies in order to have a highprobability of detecting a modest increase in risk (e.g., 133 in both exposedand unexposed groups to detect a twofold increase; alpha andCx.190;0.05,power = 80%), while less common outcomes, such as the total of all malformationsrecognized at birth, require thousands of pregnancies to have the sameprobability (e.g., more than 1200 in both exposed and unexposed groups)(15, 75, 76, 81, 82). In case-control studies, study sizes are dependentupon the frequency of exposure within the source population.<T3>A posteriori</T3> determination of power of the actual study is usefulin evaluating negative findings. Negative findings in a study of low powerwould be given considerably less weight than either a positive study, ora negative study with high power.(2) Potential bias in data collection: Sources of bias may include selectionbias and information bias (83). Selection bias may occur when an individual'swillingness to participate varies with certain characteristics relatingto the exposure status or health status of that individual. In addition,selection bias may operate in the identification of subjects for study.For example, for studies of very early loss, use of hospital records toidentify embryonic or early fetal loss will underascertain events, becausewomen are not always hospitalized for these outcomes. More weight wouldbe given in a risk assessment to a study in which a more complete listof pregnancies is obtained by, for example, either interviewing the womenin the study or, in a prospective study, collecting biological data (e.g.,human chorionic gonadotropin measurements) of pregnancy status from studymembers. A second example of different levels of ascertainment of eventsis the use of hospital records to study congenital malformations. Hospitalrecords contain more complete data on malformations than do birth certificates.Thus, a study using hospital records to identify congenital malformationswould be given more weight in a risk assessment.Information bias may result from misclassification of characteristics ofindividuals or events identified for study. Recall bias, one type of informationbias, may occur when respondents with specific exposures or outcomes recallinformation differently than those without the exposures or outcomes. Interviewbias may result when the interviewer knows a <T3>priori</T3> the category of exposure (for cohort studies) or outcome(for case-control studies) in which the respondent belongs. Use of highlystructured questionnaires and/or ``blinding'' of the interviewer will reducethe likelihood of such bias. Studies with lower likelihood of such typesof bias should carry more weight in a risk assessment.When data are collected by interview or questionnaire, the appropriaterespondent depends upon the type of data or study. For example, a comparisonof husband-wife interviews on reproduction found the wives' responses toquestions on pregnancy-related events to be considerably more completeand valid than those of the husbands (78). Studies based on interview datafrom the appropriate respondent (e.g., the woman when examining her pregnancyhistory) would carry more weight than those from proxy respondents (e.g.,the man when examining his partner's pregnancy history).Data from any source may be prone to errors or bias. Validation with anindependent data source (e.g., vital or hospital records), or use of biomarkersof exposure or outcome, where possible, may indicate the presence or absenceof bias and increase confidence in the results of the study. Those studieswith a low probability of biased data should carry more weight (81, 84).(3) Control of potential risk factors, effect modifiers, and confounders:Potential risk factors may include smoking, alcohol consumption, drug use,past reproductive history, and environmental and occupational exposure.Such characteristics should be examined, where appropriate, for the outcomeunder study, and should be controlled for in the study design and/or analysis.The potential for characteristics of the subjects to be effect modifiersand/or confounders should also be considered. An effect modifier is a factorthat produces different exposure-response relationships at different levelsof the effect modifier. For example, maternal age would be an effect modifierif the risk associated with a given exposure increased with the mother'sage. A confounder is associated with both the exposure and outcome, andthese interrelationships could distort both the magnitude and directionof the measure of association between the exposure of interest and theoutcome. For example, smoking might be a confounder in a study of the associationof socioeconomic status and low birth weight, since smoking has been associatedwith both.Both effect modifiers and confounders need to be controlled in the analysisto improve the estimate of the effects of exposure (85). A more in-depthdiscussion may be found elsewhere (83, 86). The statistical techniquesused to control for these factors require careful consideration in theirapplication and interpretation (83, 85). Studies that fail to account forthese important factors should be given less weight in a risk assessment.(4) Statistical factors: As in animal studies, pregnancies experiencedby the same woman are not independent events. In animal studies, the litteris generally used as the unit of measure to deal with nonindependence ofevents. This approach is difficult in humans since the pregnancies aresequential, with the risk factors changing for different pregnancies (15,41, 81, 86). If more than one pregnancy per woman is included, as is oftennecessary due to small study groups, the use of nonindependent observationsoverestimates the true size of the population at risk and artificiallyincreases the significance level (87). Some approaches to deal with theseissues have been suggested (81, 88). At this point in time, a generallyaccepted solution to this problem has not been developed.b. Selection of outcomes for study. As already discussed, a number of endpoints can be considered in the evaluation of adverse developmental effects.However, some of the outcomes are not easily observed in humans. Theseinclude early embryonic loss and reproductive capacity of the offspring.Currently, the most feasible end points for epidemiologic studies are reproductivehistory studies of some pregnancy outcomes (e.g., embryo/fetal loss, birthweight, sex ratio, congenital malformations, postnatal function, and neonatalgrowth and survival) and measures of subfertility/infertility which insome cases might be evidence of very early embryonic loss. Factors requiringcontrol in the design or analysis (such as other risk factors, effect modifiers,and confounders) may vary depending on the specific outcomes selected forstudy.The developmental outcomes available for epidemiologic examination arelimited by a number of factors, including the relative magnitude of theexposure since differing spectra of outcomes may occur at different exposurelevels, the size and demographic characteristics of the population, andthe ability to observe the reproductive outcome in humans. Improved methodsfor identifying some outcomes such as embryonic or very early fetal lossusing new human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) assays may change the spectrumof outcomes available for study (12).Demographic characteristics of the population, such as marital stutus,age distribution, education, and prior reproductive history are associatedwith the probability of whether couples will attempt to have children.There may also be differences in the use of birth control, which wouldaffect the number of outcomes available for study. Additionally, workersmay move in and out of areas with differing levels and types of exposures,affecting the number of exposed and comparison pregnancies for study. Largerpopulations are usually necessary in environmental settings, since theexposures in environmental settings are generally much lower than in occupationalsettings.c. Reproductive history studies.(1) Pregnancy outcomes: Pregnancy outcomes examined in human studies ofparental exposures may include embryo/fetal loss, congenital malformations,birth weight, sex ratio at birth, and possibly postnatal survival, growth,and function. Epidemiologic studies that focus on only one type of pregnancyoutcome may miss a true effect of exposure. As mentioned above, some reproductiveend points can be thought of as a continuum of adverse effects; for example,a malformed stillbirth would not be included in a study of defects observedat live birth, even though the etiology could be identical (75, 89). Studiesthat examine multiple end points could yield more information, but theresults may be difficult to interpret. Evidence of a dose-response relationshipis usually an inportant criterion in the assessment of a toxic exposure.However, traditional dose-response relationships may not always be observedfor some end points. For example, with increasing dose, a pregnancy mightend in an embryo/fetal loss, rather than a live birth with malformations.A shift in the patterns of outcomes could result from differences eitherin level of exposure or in timing (90, 91). Therefore, a risk assessmentshould, when possible, attempt to look at the interrelationship of differentreproductive end points and patterns of exposure.(2) Measures of fertility: Normally, studies of subfertility/infertilitywould not be included in an evaluation of developmental effects. However,in humans it is difficult to identify very early embryonic loss, and todistinguish it from subfertility/infertility. Thus, studies that examinesubfertility or infertility indirectly examine loss very early in the gestationalperiod. Studies of subfertility may be thought of as the study of non-events:a couple is unable to have children within a specific time frame. Therefore,the epidemiologic measurement of reduced fertility is typically indirect,and is accomplished by comparing birth rates or time intervals betweenbirths or pregnancies. In these evaluations, the couple's joint abilityto procreate is estimated. One method, the Standardized Birth Ratio (SBR;also referred to as the Standardized Fertility Ratio), compares the numberof births observed to those expected based on the person-years of observationstratified by factors such as time period, age, race, marital status, parity,contraceptive use, etc. (92-94). The SBR is analogous to the StandardizedMortality Ratio (SMR), a measure frequently used in studies of occupationalcohorts, and has similar limitations in interpretation (87, 95) and inusefulness for risk assessment.Analysis of the time period between recognized pregnancies or live birthshas been suggested as another indirect measure of fertility (96). Becausethe time interval between births increases with increasing parity (97),comparisons within birth order (parity) are more appropriate. A statisticalmethod (Cox regression) can stratify by birth or pregnancy order to helpcontrol for nonindependence of these events in the same woman.Fertility may also be affected by alterations in sexual behavior. However,limited data are available linking toxic exposures to these alterationsin humans. Moreover, such data are not easily obtained in epidemiologystudies. More information on this subject is available in the ProposedGuidelines for Assessing Male Reproductive Risk (38) and the Proposed Guidelinesfor Assessing Female Reproductive Risk (39).d. Community studies/surveillance programs. Epidemiologic studies may alsobe based upon broad populations such as a community, a nationwide probabilitysample, or surveillance programs (such as birth defects registries). Anumber of case-control studies have examined the relationship between broadclasses of parental occupation in certain communities or countries, andembryo/fetal loss (98), birth defects (99-101), and childhood cancer (100,102-104). In these reports, jobs are typically classified into broad categoriesbased on the probability of exposure to certain classes or levels of exposure(e.g., 100). Such studies are most helpful in the identification of topicsfor additional study. However, because of the broad groupings of typesof levels of exposure, such studies are not typically useful for risk assessmentof a particular agent.Surveillance programs may also exist in occupational settings. In thiscase, reproductive histories and/or clinical evaluation could monitor forreproductive effects of exposures. Both could yield very useful data forrisk assessment; however, a clinical evaluation program would be costlyto maintain.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. Other Considerations</ITAG>1.<T3> Pharmacokinetics. </T3>Extrapolation of toxicity data between speciescan be aided considerably by the availability of data on the pharmacokineticsof a particular agent in the species tested and, when available, in humans.Information on absorption, half-life, placental metabolism and transfer,comparative metabolism, and concentrations of the parent compound and metabolitesin the maternal animal and conceptus may be useful in predicting risk fordevelopmental toxicity. Such data may also be helpful in defining the dose-responsecurve, developing a more accurate comparison of species sensitivity, includingthat of humans (105, 106), determining dosimetry at target sites, and comparingpharmacokinetic profiles for various dosing regimens or routes of exposure.Pharmacokinetic studies in developmental toxicology are most useful ifconducted in pregnant animals at the stage when developmental insults occur.The correlation of pharmacokinetic parameters and developmental toxicitydata may be useful in determining the contribution of specific pharmacokineticparameters to the effects observed (107).2. <T3>Comparisons of Molecular Structure. </T3>Comparisons of the chemicalor physical properties of an agent with those of known developmental toxicantsmay provide some indication of a potential for developmental toxicity.Such information may be helpful in setting priorities for testing of agentsor for evaluation of potential toxicity when only minimal data are available.Structure/activity relationships have not been well studied in developmentaltoxicology, although data are available that suggest structure-activityrelationships for certain classes of chemicals (e.g., glycol ethers, steroids,retinoids). Under certain circumstances (e.g., in the case of new chemicals),this is one of several procedures used to evaluate the potential for toxicitywhen little or no data are available. <ITAG tagnum="81">D. Weight-of-Evidence Determination </ITAG>Information from all available studies, whether indicative of potentialconcern or not, must be evaluated and factored into a weight-of-evidencejudgment as to the likelihood that an agent may pose a risk for developmentaltoxicity in humans. The primary considerations are the human data (whichare seldom available) and the experimental animal data. The qualitativeassessment for developmental toxicity should consider quality of the data,resolving power of the studies, number and types of end points examined,relevance of route and timing of exposure, appropriateness of the doseselection, replication of effects, number of species examined, and availabilityof human case reports or series, and/or epidemiologic study data. In addition,pharmacokinetic data and structure-activity considerations, as well asother factors that may affect the strength of the evidence, should be takeninto account. Therefore, all data pertinent to developmental toxicity shouldbe examined in the evaluation of a chemical's potential to cause developmentaltoxicity in humans, and sound scientific judgment should be exercised ininterpreting the data in terms of the risk for adverse human developmentalhealth effects. A categorization scheme for the weight of evidence has been developed.It contains several broad categories that reflect the accumulated database on agents and serves as an indicator of whether exposure to the substancemay cause developmental toxicity in humans. It represents one importantstep in the evaluation of agents. However, the risk of any given exposureto an agent can only be derived from an appreciation of its intrinsic biologicalactivity and the nature of the anticipated exposure conditions. These importantaspects are developed in subsequent sections of this Guideline. Placing an agent in a particular weight-of-evidence category such as ``adequateevidence for human developmental toxicity'' does not mean that it willbe a developmental toxicant at every dose (because of the assumption ofa threshold) or in every situation (e.g., hazard may vary significantlydepending on route and timing of exposure). Thus, in the final characterizationof risk, the weight-of-evidence determination should always be presentedin conjunction with information on dose-response (NOAEL and/or LOAEL),and, if available, with the human exposure estimate. The weight-of-evidence scheme (outlined in Table 3) defines three levelsof confidence for data used to identify developmental hazards and to assessthe risk of human developmental toxicity: definitive evidence, adequateevidence, and inadequate evidence. Within the definitive evidence and adequateevidence categories, there are subcategories for evidence indicating adverseeffects and for evidence indicating no apparent effects. In both categories,the evidence required to classify an agent as demonstrating no adverseeffects is greater than that required to demonstrate an adverse effectand must include evaluations of a variety of potential manifestations ofdevelopmental toxicity. Greater evidence is required because it is muchmore difficult both biologically and statistically to support a findingof no apparent adverse effect than one of an adverse effect. Most agentsmeeting current testing requirements would be expected to fall within theadequate evidence category, while many for which little or no informationis available would be classified in the inadequate category. Few agentswould be expected to fall into the definitive evidence category becausethe human data necessary to meet the criteria for this category would bedifficult to obtain. <ITAG tagnum="84">TABLE 3.

To allow for this, the languageused in the scheme is intentionally broad. Definitive Evidence for _Human Developmental Toxicity This category includes agents for which there is sufficient evidence fromepidemiologic studies for the scientific community to judge that a causeand effect relationship exists. Case reports in conjunction with othersupporting evidence may also be used. _No Apparent Human Developmental Toxicity Agents in this category have not been associated with developmental toxicityin well-executed epidemiologic studies (e.g., case control and cohort)with adequate power. A variety of potential manifestations of developmentaltoxicity have been studied. Supporting animal data may or may not be available.Adequate Evidence for _Potential Human Developmental Toxicity This category includes agents for which sufficient evidence exists forthem to be considered potential human developmental toxicants. The minimumevidence necessary for considering an agent a potential human developmentaltoxicant would include data from an appropriate, well-executed study ina single experimental animal species that demonstrates developmental toxicity,and/or strong suggestive evidence from adequate clinical/epidemiologicstudies. Evidence may be modified by further data, such as studies in additionalspecies or by other routes of exposure, and replication of the findings.Development of pharmacokinetic or mechanistic information may reduce uncertaintiesin extrapolation to the human. The strength of the evidence increases asit approaches the definition for definitive human developmental toxicity._No Apparent Potential Human Developmental Toxicity This category includes agents with data from appropriate well-executedstudies in several species (at least two) which evaluated a variety ofthe potential manifestations of developmental toxicity and showed no developmentaleffects at doses that were minimally toxic to the adult animal. In addition,there may be human data from adequate studies supportive of no adverseeffects. Inadequate Evidence for Determining Potential Human Developmental ToxicityThis category includes agents for which there is less than the minimumsufficient evidence necessary for assessing human risk. However, data onagents that fall into this category may be used to determine the need foradditional testing or information that would then, if adequate, move theagent into the adequate evidence category. This category includes a variety of types of information such as the lackof any data on the developmental toxicity potential of an agent, data froman appropriate well-executed study in a single species showing no developmentaltoxicity, data from poorly-conducted studies in animals (e.g., small numbersof animals, inappropriate dose selection, other confounding factors) orinadequate data in humans. Additionally, data on structure/activity relationships,short-term test data, pharmacokinetic data, or data on metabolic precursorsof the agent of interest could be used to call for further testing butwould be considered insufficient by themselves to assess human risk. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Dose-Response Assessment </ITAG>When quantitative human dose-effect data are available and with sufficientrange of exposure, dose-response relationships may be examined. Data onexposure from human studies are usually qualitative, such as employmentor residence histories; quantitative or dose data are frequently not available.In human studies, especially retrospective ones, linking of specific timeperiods and specific exposures, even on a qualitative level, may be difficultdue to errors of recall or recordkeeping (where records are available).The appropriate exposure depends on the outcome(s) studied, the biologicmechanism affected by exposure, and the half-life of the exposure. Theprobability of misclassification of exposure status may affect the abilityof a study to recognize a true effect (15, 41, 76, 108, 109). Since data on human dose-effect relationships are rarely available, thedose-response assessment is usually based on the evaluation of tests performedin laboratory animals. Evidence for a dose-response relationship is animportant criterion in the assessment of developmental toxicity, althoughthis may be based on limited data from standard studies using three dosegroups and a control group. Most human developmental toxicants that havebeen studied alter development at doses within a narrow range near thelowest maternally toxic dose (22). Therefore, for most chemicals, the exposuresituations of concern will be those that are potentially within this range.For those few chemicals where developmental effects occur at much lowerlevels than maternal effects, the potential for exposing the conceptusto damaging doses is much greater. As mentioned previously (section III.A.2.),however, traditional dose-response relationships may not always be observedfor some end points. For example, as the exposure level rises, embryo/fetolethallevels may be reached, resulting in an observed decrease in malformationswith increasing dose (81, 90). The potential for this response patternindicates that dose-response relationships of individual end points aswell as combinations of end points (e.g., dead and malformed combined)must be carefully examined and interpreted. Identification of a NOAEL and/or LOAEL is based on the lowest dose at whichan adverse effect is detected from any adequate developmental toxicitystudy. Adequacy of the data to be used for determination must be judgedusing the weight-of-evidence approach discussed in section III.D. NOAELsand applied uncertainty factors may be used to determine a reference dosefor developmental toxicity (RfD<T2>DT</T2>) that is assumed to be below the threshold for an increasein adverse developmental effects. The RfD<T2>DT</T2> is based on a short duration of exposure as is typically usedin developmental toxicity studies. The term RfD<T2>DT</T2> is used to distinguish from the RfD which refers to chronicexposure situations (10). Uncertainty factors for developmental toxicitygenerally include a 10-fold factor for interspecies variation and a 10-foldfactor for intraspecies variation. In general, an additional uncertaintyfactor is not applied to account for duration of exposure. Additional factorsmay be applied due to a variety of uncertainties that exist in the database. For example, the standard study design for a developmental toxicitystudy calls for a low dose that demonstrates a NOAEL, but there may becircumstances where a risk assessment must be based on the results of astudy in which a NOAEL for developmental toxicity was not identified. Rather,the lowest dose administered caused significant effect(s) and was identifiedas the LOAEL. In circumstances where only a LOAEL is available, questionsrelative to the sensitivity of end points reported, adequacy of dose levelstested, or confidence in the LOAEL reported may require the use of an additionaluncertainty factor of 10 (10). The total uncertainty factor selected isthen divided into the NOAEL/LOAEL for the most sensitive end point fromthe most appropriate and/or sensitive mammalian species to determine theRfD<T2>DT</T2>. Although the Agency currently uses the NOAEL/uncertainty factor approachto establish an RfD<T2>DT</T2>, discussions of risk extrapolation procedures have noted thatimproved mathematical tools are needed for developing estimates of potentialhuman developmental risk (45, 110). Gaylor (111) suggested an approachfor estimating risk that combines the use of mathematical models for low-doseestimation of risk with the application of an uncertainty factor basedon a preselected level of risk. This approach is similar to approachesproposed for carcinogenesis, but does not preclude the possibility of athreshold, and may provide a more quantitative approach to estimating risk.Another approach proposed by Rai and Van Ryzin (112) and recently appliedby Faustman et al. (113), uses a simple two-component developmental modelin which the first component represents a dose-related risk to the litterenvironment and the second component expresses the risk to an individualoffspring conditional upon a predisposing risk to the litter. These approachesand others have been summarized recently (5). In addition, other methodsfor expressing risk are being sought and will be applied, if consideredappropriate.The development of biologically-based dose-response models in developmentaltoxicology is limited by a number of factors, including a lack of understandingof the biological mechanisms underlying developmental toxicity, intra/interspeciesdifferences in the types of developmental events, and the influence ofmaternal effects on the dose-response curve. A biological threshold isassumed for most developmental effects based on known homeostatic, compensatory,or adaptive mechanisms that must be overcome before a toxic end point ismanifested, and on the rationale that the embryo is known to have somecapacity for repair of damage or insult (90). In addition, most developmentaldeviations are probably multifactorial in nature (114). Although a thresholdis assumed for developmental effects, the existence of a NOAEL in an animalstudy does not prove or disprove the existence or level of a true threshold;it only defines the highest level of exposure under the conditions of thestudy that is not associated with a significant increase in effect. Theuncertainties concerning this assumption are being discussed currentlyin the literature (25, 26). In conclusion, dose-response findings in developmental toxicity studiesare used as part of the risk characterization. This use is dependent uponscientific judgment as to the accuracy and adequacy of the data. In addition,the slope of the dose-response curve should be considered in conjunctionwith a determination as to the adequacy of the exposure levels tested,the sensitivity of the end points reported, and the appropriateness ofthe experimental design to determine a level of confidence in the dataand the resultant confidence in the LOAEL, NOAEL, and the uncertainty factorsapplied to obtain the RfD<T2>DT</T2>.<ITAG tagnum="84">V. Exposure Assessment </ITAG>In order to obtain a quantitative estimate of risk for the human population,an estimate of human exposure is required. The Guidelines for EstimatingExposures have been published separately (115) and will not be discussedin detail here. In general, the exposure assessment describes the magnitude,duration, schedule, and route of exposure. This information is developedfrom monitoring data and from estimates based on modeling of environmentalexposures. Unique considerations for developmental toxicity are durationand period of exposure as related to stage of development (i.e., criticalperiods), and the possibility that a single exposure may be sufficientto produce adverse developmental effects (i.e., repeated exposure is nota necessary prerequisite for developmental toxicity to be manifested).For these reasons, it is assumed that a single exposure at the criticaltime in development is sufficient to produce an adverse developmental effect.Therefore, the human exposure estimate used to calculate the margin ofexposure is usually based on a single dose that is not adjusted for durationof exposure, and the number of exposures is not considered important unlessthere is evidence for a cumulative effect. It should be recognized alsothat exposure of almost any segment of the human population (i.e., fertilemen and women, the conceptus, and the child up to the age of sexual maturation)may lead to risk to the developing organism.<ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Risk Characterization </ITAG>Many uncertainties described in these Guidelines are associated with thetoxicological and exposure components of risk assessments in developmentaltoxicology. In the past, these uncertainties have often not been readilyapparent or consistently presented. The presentation of any risk assessmentfor developmental toxicity should be accompanied by statements concerningthe weight of the evidence, dose-response relationships and assumptionsunderlying the estimation of the RfD<T2>DT</T2>, estimates of human exposure, and any factors that affect thequality and precision of the assessment. The risk characterization of anagent should be based on data from the most appropriate species, or, ifsuch information is not available, on the most sensitive species tested.It should also be based on the most sensitive indicator of toxicity, whethermaternal, paternal, or developmental, and should be considered in relationshipto other forms of toxicity. In the risk characterization, the dose-response and the human exposureestimate may be combined either by comparing the RfD<T2>DT</T2> and the human exposure estimate or by calculating the marginof exposure (MOE). The MOE is the ratio of the NOAEL from the most appropriateor sensitive species to the estimated human exposure level from all potentialsources (53). If a NOAEL is not available, a LOAEL may be used in the calculationof the MOE. In this case, the NOAEL may be estimated from the LOAEL byapplying an uncertainty factor (10-fold) to assess the impact on the MOE(53). The MOE is presented along with a discussion of the weight of evidence,including the nature and quality of the hazard and exposure data, the numberof species affected, and the dose-response information. The RfD<T2>DT</T2> comparison with the human exposure estimate and the calculationof the MOE are conceptually similar but are used in different regulatorysituations. The choice of approach is dependent upon several factors, includingthe statute involved, the situation being addressed, the data base used,and the needs of the decision maker. The RfD<T2>DT</T2> and/or the MOE are considered along with other risk assessmentand risk management issues in making risk management decisions, but thescientific issues that must be taken into account in establishing themhave been addressed here. These Guidelines summarize the procedures that the U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency will follow in evaluating the potential for agents to cause developmentaltoxicity. While these are the first amendments to the developmental toxicityguidelines issued in 1986, further revisions and updates will be made asadvances occur in the field. Further studies that: (1) Delineate the mechanismsof developmental toxicity and pathogenesis, (2) provide comparative pharmacokineticdata, and (3) elucidate the functional modalities that may be altered byexposure to toxic agents, will aid in the interpretation of data and interspeciesextrapolation. These types of studies, along with further evaluation ofthe relationship between maternal and developmental toxicity and the conceptof a threshold, will provide for the development of improved mathematicalmodels to more precisely assess risk.<ITAG tagnum="74">VII.
