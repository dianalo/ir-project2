On June 10, 1987, the ERA fileda Petition for the Implementation of Special Refund Procedures in connectionwith a Consent Order that it entered into with Murphy Oil Corporation (Murphy).I. BackgroundMurphy is a major integrated refiner which produced and sold crude oiland full range of refined petroleum products during the period of federalprice controls. The firm was therefore subject to the Mandatory PetroleumPrice Regulations set forth at 6 CFR Part 150 and 10 CFR Parts 210, 211,and 212. During the period of federal controls, the ERA conducted an extensiveaudit of Murphy's operations and, as a result of the audit, alleged thatMurphy had violated certain applicable DOE price and allocation regulationsin its sales of crude oil and refined petroleum products. Settlement discussionswere held, and on February 9, 1987, the ERA and Murphy finalized a ConsentOrder (Consent Order No. RMUH01983Z) that resolved disputes regarding Murphy'srefined petroleum product operations during the period January 1, 1973through January 27, 1981 (consent order period). Pursuant to the termsof the Consent Order, Murphy remitted a total of $7,104,217.29 (the consentorder fund) \1\<NOTE/> into an interest-bearing escrow account, for ultimate distributionby the DOE through Subpart V.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\1\ This amount consists of the principal consent order amountof $7,000,000, plus $104,217.29 in interest which accrued prior to Murphy'spayment to the DOE. For accounting purposes, the interest remitted by Murphyshall be considered as additional principal.On Janaury 26, 1988, the OHA issued a Proposed Decision and Order (PDandamp;O)setting forth a tentative plan for the distribution of the Murphy consentorder funds. In order to give notice to all potentially affected parties,a copy of the PDandamp;O was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> and comments regarding the proposed refund procedureswere solicited. 53 FR 3440 (February 5, 1988). Two interested parties,the Petroleum Marketers Association of America (PMAA) and the ``MurphyJobbers Group'', jointly submitted comments concerning the proposed proceduresfor the distribution of the Murphy consent order funds. In this Decisionand Order, we will address those comments and adopt final procedures forthe distribution of the Murphy funds.II. Final Refund ProceduresThe procedural regulations of the DOE set forth general guidelines to beused by OHA in formulating and implementing a plan of distribution forfunds received as a result of an enforcement proceeding. 10 CFR Part 205,Subpart V. The Subpart V process may be used in situations in which theDOE is unable to identify readily those persons who may have been injuredby the alleged regulatory violations or to determine the amount of suchinjuries. A more detailed discussion of Subpart V and the authority ofOHA to fashion procedures to distribute refunds is set forth in the casesof <T3>Office of Enforcement</T3>, 9 DOE andpara; 82.508 (1981): and <T3>Office of Enforcement, </T3>8 DOE andpara; 82,597 (1981) (<T3>Vickers</T3>).Pursuant to the goals of the Subpart V regulations, we will attempt toprovide refunds to claimants who demonstrates that they were injured byMurphy's alleged regulatory violations during the January 1, 1973 throughJanuary 27, 1981 consent order period.\2\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ We recognize that we may receive claims based upon Murphy'salleged violation of the DOE allocation regulations. <T3>See </T3>10 CFR Part 211. We will evaluate such claims by referringto the standards set forth in Decisions such as Office of Special Counsel,10 DOE andpara; 85,048 at 88,220 (1982) (Amoco), and OKC Corp./Town andamp;Country Markets, Inc., 12 DOE andpara; 85,094 (1984). Under those standardsan allocation claimant must: (1) demonstrate the existence of a supplier/purchaserrelationship with the consent order firm and the likelihood that the consentorder firm failed to furnish petroleum products that it was obligated tosupply to the claimant under 10 CFR Part 211; (2) provide evidence thatit had contemporaneously notified the DOE or otherwise sought redress forthe alleged allocation violation and (3) establish that it was injuredand document the extent of the injury. The remainder of this Decsion concernsonly the filing of claims involving Murphy's alleged pricing violations.Residual funds in the Murphy escrow account will be distributed in accordancewith the provisions of the Petroleum Overcharge Distribution and RestitutionAct of 1986 (PODRA), Pub. L. No. 99-509, Fed. Energy Guidelines (PetroleumRegulations 1974-1981) andpara; 11,702 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="81">A. Calculation of Refund Amounts</ITAG>The first step in the refund process is the calculation of an applicant'spotential refund. To accomplish this, we will presume that the allegedovercharges were spread evenly over all of Murphy's sales of refined petroleumproducts during the consent order period. Under this volumetric presumption,a claimant's potential refund generally will be computed by multiplyingthe number of gallons of covered products that it purchased from Murphyby a volumetric factor of $0.000817 per gallon.\3\<NOTE/> We derived this fugure by dividng the $7,104,217.29 receivedfrom Murphy by the 8,695,987,648 gallons of refined products subject toprice and allocation controls that Murphy sold during the consent orderperiod. In addition, successful claimants will receive proportionate sharesof the interest that has accrued on the Murphy escrow account.\4\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\ Although the Murphy consent order covers the period January1, 1973 through January 28, 1981, applicants may file claims for volumespurchased only while the particular product was subject to federal pricecontrols. Therefore, claimants may apply for refunds based on purchasesmade from Murphy between March 6, 1973 and the date of decontrol for eachparticular product. Below is a list of regulated petroleum products andthe dates on which they were decontrolled:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\4\ Because we realize that the impact on an individual claimantmay have been greater than its potential refund calculated using the volumetricmethodology, a claimant may submit evidence detailing the specific allegedovercharge that it sustained in order to be eligible for a larger refund.<T3>See </T3>Standard Oil Co. (Indiana)/Army and Air Force Exchange Service,12 DOE andpara; 85,015 (1984).<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L2,tp0,i1,s25,xs60</C> <H1>Product</H1><H1>Decontrol date</H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Motor gasoline, propand <D>Jan. 28, 1981.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Butane and natural gasoline <D>Jan. 1, 1980</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Aviation gas and jet fuel <D>FEb. 26, 1979</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Naptha-based jet fuel <D>Oct. 1, 1976</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Napthas <D>Sept. 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Diesel fuel, kerosene <D>July 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">No. 1 and No. 2 hearing oil <D>Do</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Residual fuel <D>June 1, 1976.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Ethane and asphalt <D>Apr. 1, 1974.</D></ITAG></ITAG>We generally require claimants to submit monthly purchase schedules inorder to establish their total purchase volumes from a consent order firm.In their comments, the PMAA and the Murphy Jobbers Group urge that, instead,we allow all refund applicants to submit yearly schedules of their purchasevolumes of Murphy covered products. We are not persuaded that this wouldbe appropriate. An annual schedule can mask certain factors, such as seasonalpurchase patterns, which help us to ascertain the accuracy of an applicant'ssubmission. Therefore, we will accept annual purchase volume data onlyif it is accompanied by adequte supporting documentation, such as a computerprintout of purchases provided by Murphy.As in previous cases, only claims for at least $15 in principal will beprocessed. This minimum has been adopted in refined product refund proceedingsbecause the cost of processing claims for refunds of less than $15 outweighsthe beneifts of restitution in those instances. <T3>See, e.g., Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,339 (1985).<ITAG tagnum="81">B. Determination of Injury</ITAG>Once a claimant's potential refund has been calculated, we must determinewhether the claimant was injured by its purchases from Murphy, <T3>i.e., </T3>whether it was forced to absorb the alleged overcharges.Based on our experience in numerous Subpart V proceedings, we will adoptcertain presumptions concerning injury in this case. The use of presumptionsin refund cases is specifically authorized by DOE procedural regulations.10 C.F.R. andSection; 205.282(e). An applicant that is not covered by oneof these presumptions must demonstrate injury in accordance with the non-presumptionprocedures outlined in the latter part of this Decision.<T3>1. Presumptions Concerning Injury: </T3>The presumptions we will adoptin this case are designed to allow claimants to participate in the refundprocess without incurring inordinate expense, and to enable OHA to considerthe refund applications in the most efficient way possible. We will presumethat end-users of Murphy covered products, certain types of regulated firms,and cooperatives were injured by their purchases from Murphy. In addition,we will adopt presumptions regarding small and mid-level claims submittedby refiners, resellers and retailers. Finally, we will presume that refiners,resellers and retailers that made spot purchases of Murphy products, aswell as those who sold Murphy products on consignment, were not injuredby their purchases. Each of these presumptions is listed below, along withthe rationale underlying its use.<T3>a. End-Users: </T3>First, in accordance with prior Subpart V proceedings,we will presume that end-users of Murphy products were injured by the firm'salleged overcharges. Unlike regulated firms in the petroleum industry,members of this group generally were not subject to price controls duringthe consent order period, and were not required to keep records which justifiedselling price increases by reference to cost increases. Consequently, analysisof the impact of the alleged overcharges on the final prices of goods andservices produced by members of this group would be beyond the scope ofa special refund proceeding. <T3>See Marion Corporation, </T3>12 DOE andpara; 85,014 (1984) and casescited therein. Therefore, end-users need only document their purchase volumesof Murphy covered products to demonstrate that they were injured by thealleged overcharges.<T3>b. Regulated Firms and Cooperatives: </T3>Second, public utilities,agricultural cooperatives, and other firms whose prices are regulated bygovernment agencies or cooperative agreements do not have to submit detailedproof of injury. Such firms would have routinely passed through price increases,including overcharges, to their customers. Likewise, their customers wouldshare the benefits of cost decreases resulting from refunds. <T3>See, e.g., Office of Special Counsel, </T3>9 DOE andpara; 82,538 (1982)<T3>(Tenneco); Office of Special Counsel, </T3>9 DOE andpara; 82,545 at 85,244(1982) <T3>(Pennzoil). </T3>Such firms applying for refunds should certify thatthey will pass through any refund received to their customers and shouldexplain how they will alert the appropriate regulatory body or membershipgroup to monies received. Purchases that cooperatives subsequently resoldto nonmembers will generally not be covered by this presumption.<T3>c. Refiner, Reseller and Retailer Small Claims: </T3>Third, we willpresume that a firm that resold Murphy products and requests a refund of$5,000 or less, excluding accrued interest, was injured by Murphy's allegedovercharges. A refiner, reseller, or retailer seeking a refund under thissmall claims presumption will not be required to submit evidence of injurybeyond documentation of its purchase volumes of covered products from Murphyduring the consent order period. <T3>See Texas Oil andamp; Gas Corp., </T3>12 DOE andpara; 85,069 at 88,210(1984). As we have noted in numerous prior proceedings, there may be considerableexpense involved in gathering the types of data necessary to support adetailed claim of injury; in some cases, that expense might possibly exceedthe expected refund. Consequently, failure to allow simplified applicationprocedures for small claims could deprive injured parties of their opportunityto obtain a refund. Furthermore, use of the small claims presumption isdesirable in that it allows the OHA to process efficiently the large numberof routine refund claims expected. Refiners, resellers and retailers ofMurphy products that are seeking full volumetric refunds in excess of $5,000must follow the injury demonstration procedures that are outlined belowin section 2.\5\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\5\ If an applicant with a claim greater than $5,000 attemptsto make a detailed showing of injury in support of a full volumetric refundbut, instead, demonstrates that it was injured by less than $5,000, itcannot elect to limit its claim to the $5,000 small claims threshold. <T3>See, e.g., </T3>Union Texas Petroleum Corp./Arrow Enterprises, Inc.,15 DOE andpara; 85,087 (1986).<T3>d. Refiner, Reseller and Retailer Mid-Level Claims: </T3>Fourth, wewill adopt a mid-level presumption of injury under which a refiner, reseller,or retailer who purchased more than 15,298,347 gallons of Murphy coveredproducts may elect to receive 40 percent of its full volumetric share upto $50,000, in lieu of making a detailed showing of injury.\6\<NOTE/> The use of this presumption is based on detailed marketinganalyses that we conducted in prior special refund proceedings, which indicatedthat mid-level claimants likely absorbed 40 percent of any overchargesthat they allegedly incurred. <T3>See Gulf Oil Corp., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,381 (1987) <T3>(Gulf II).</T3>\7\<NOTE/> As with the small claims presumption, an applicant that choosesto rely on the mid-level presumption will be required only to documentits purchase volumes of Murphy covered products in order to demonstratethat it was injured by Murphy's alleged overcharges.\8\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\6\ A claimant with purchases of 15,298,347 gallons or lessthat wishes to rely on an injury presumption can receive a larger refundby limiting its claim to the $5,000 small claims threshold than by utilizingthe mid-level presumption. If 40 percent of a claimant's volumetric shareexceeds $50,000, <T3>i.e., </T3>if the claimant purchased more than 152,998,776 gallonsof Murphy covered products, the claimant may choose to limit its claimto $50,000.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\7\ The PMAA and the Murphy Jobbers Group have suggested thatwe adopt higher presumptive levels of injury for middle distillates andnatural gas liquids as we did in Getty Oil Co., 15 DOE andpara; 85,064 (1986)(Getty). The different absorption fractions that we adopted in Getty, however,were based strictly on Getty's pricing data. Getty at 88,117. They arenot relevant to the present proceeding. Furthermore, the use of a singleaverage absorption fraction simplifies the refund procedures for the benefitof both the claimants and the DOE. Therefore, we will not adopt the PMAAand Murphy Jobbers Group's suggestion. <T3>See </T3>Gulf II at 88,737.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\8\ A mid-level claimant may elect not to receive a refundbased upon this presumption and may instead attempt to show that it iseligible for a refund equal to its full volumetric share by making a detailedshowing of injury using the criteria set forth later in this Decision.The 40 percent presumption, however, will not be available to claimantswho submit a detailed injury showing which leads us to conclude that theyare eligible for a refund of less than 40 percent of their volumetric share.<T3>e. Spot Purchasers: </T3>We will also presume that refiners, resellersand retailers that were spot purchasers of a Murphy covered product, <T3>i.e., </T3>made only sporadic, discretionary purchases, were not injuredby their purchases. Consequently, they generally will be ineligible forrefunds. The basis for this presumption is that a spot purchaser tendedto have considerable discretion as to where and when to make a purchase,and therefore would not have made a purchase unless it was able to recoverthe full amount of its purchase price, including any alleged overcharges,from its customers. <T3>See Vickers </T3>at 85,396-97. In past proceedings, however, a spotpurchaser has been able to rebut this presumption by demonstrating thatits base period supply obligation limited its discretion in making thepurchases and that it resold the product at a loss that was not subsequentlyrecouped. <T3>See, e.g., Saber Energy, Inc./Mobil Oil Corp., </T3>14 DOE andpara; 85,170(1986).<T3>f. Consignees: </T3>Finally, we will presume that consignees of Murphycovered products were not injured by the firm's alleged pricing violations.<T3>See, e.g., Jay Oil Co., </T3>16 DOE andpara; 85,147 (1987). A consigneeagent generally sold products pursuant to an agreement whereby its supplierestablished the prices to be charged by the consignee and compensated theconsignee with a fixed commission based upon the volume of products thatit sold. A consignee may rebut the presumption of non-injury by demonstratingthat its sales volumes and corresponding commission revenues declined dueto the alleged uncompetitiveness of Murphy's pricing practices. <T3>See Gulf Oil Corp./C.F. Canter Oil Co., </T3>13 DOE andpara; 85,388 at88,962 (1986).<T3>2. Non-Presumption Demonstration of Injury: </T3>A refiner, reselleror retailer with a full volumetric refund in excess of $5,000 that doesnot elect to receive a refund under either the small claims or 40 percentmid-level presumptions will be required to demonstrate its injury. Thereare two aspects to such a demonstration. First, a firm generally is requiredto provide a monthly schedule of its banks of unrecouped increased productcosts for each covered product that it purchased from Murphy during theconsent order period.\9\<NOTE/> Cost banks for a product should cover the period November1, 1973 through the product's price decontrol date.\10\<NOTE/> If a firm no longer has records of contemporaneously calculatedcost banks for a particular product, it may approximate those banks bysubmitting the following information regarding its purchases of that productfrom all of its suppliers:<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\9\ Claimants who have relied upon their banked costs in orderto be eligible to receive refunds in other special refund proceedings shouldsubtract those refunds from the cumulative banked costs submitted in thisproceeding. <T3>See </T3>Husky Oil Co./Metro Oil Products, Inc., 16 DOE andpara; 85,090at 88,179 (1987).<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\10\ Retailers and resellers of motor gasoline were requiredto maintain cost bank data only until July 15, 1979 and April 30, 1980,respectively. Therefore, in showing injury with respect to their purchasesof motor gasoline, such claimants will not be required to submit cost bankmaterial up to the January 28, 1981 decontrol data of motor gasoline.(1) The weighted average gross profit margin that the firm received forthe product on May 15, 1973;(2) A monthly schedule of the weighted average gross profit margins thatit received for the product during the period, November 1, 1973 throughthe product's price decontrol date; and(3) A monthly schedule of the firm's sales of the product during the periodNovember 1, 1973 through the product's price decontrol date.\11\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\11\ For motor gasoline, retailers and resellers have to submitthe information detailed in Parts (2) and (3) only through July 15, 1979,and April 30, 1980, respectively. <T3>See supra </T3>note 10.The existence of banks of unrecouped increased product costs that exceedan applicant's potential refund is only the first part of an injury demonstration.A firm must also show that market conditions forced it to absorb the allegedovercharges. We will infer this to be true if the prices the applicantpaid Murphy were higher than average market prices for the same level ofdistribution.\12\<NOTE/> Accordingly, a claimant attempting to demonstrate injuryshould submit a monthly schedule of the weighted average prices that itpaid Murphy for each covered product that it purchased between March 6,1973 and the product's price decontrol date.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\12\ We generally obtain average market price informationfrom Platt's Oil Price Handbook and Oilmanac (Platt's). If price data fora particular product is not available in Platt's, the burden of supplyingalternative information will be on the claimant.<ITAG tagnum="81">C. General Refund Application Requirements</ITAG>Pursuant to 10 CFR 205.283, we will now accept Applications for Refundfrom individuals and firms that purchased refined petroleum products soldby Murphy between March 6, 1973 and the date of decontrol for the products.There is no specific application form that must be used. However, a suggestedformat for filing a Murphy Refund Application is set forth in the Appendixto this Decision. All Applications for Refund should include the followinginformation:(1) A conspicuous reference to Case Number KEF-0095 and the name and addressof the applicant during the period for which the claim is filed, as wellas the name to whom the refund check should be made out and the addressto which the check should be sent;(2) The name, title, address and telephone number of a person who may becontacted by OHA for additional information concerning the Application;(3) The manner in which the applicant used the Murphy products, <T3>i.e., </T3>whether it was a reseller, retailer, consignee, end user,etc.;(4) For each covered product, a monthly schedule of purchases from Murphyduring the period March 6, 1973 through the product's decontrol date. <T3>See supra </T3>note 3. If an applicant received a computer printoutof its purchases from Murphy, it may submit that printout in lieu of monthlypurchase volume schedules. If the applicant was an indirect purchaser itmust also submit the name of its immediate supplier and indicate why itbelieves the covered product was originally sold by Murphy;(5) All relevant material necessary to support its claim in accordancewith the injury presumptions and requirements outlined above;(6) If the applicant was or is in any way affiliated with Murphy, an explanationof the nature of the affiliation;(7) A statement as to whether there has been a change in ownership of theentity that purchased the Murphy refined petroleum products during or sincethe consent order period. If there was such a change, the applicant mustsubmit a copy of the sales agreement, as well as provide the names andaddresses of the previous or subsequent owners;(8) A statement as to whether the applicant is or has been involved inany DOE enforcement proceedings or private actions filed under Section210 of the Economic Stabilization Act. If these actions have been concluded,the applicant should furnish a copy of any final order issued in the matter.If the action is still in progress, the applicant should briefly describethe action and its current status. The applicant must inform OHA of anychange in status while its Application for Refund is pending. <T3>See</T3> 10 CFR 205.9(d);(9) A statement as to whether the applicant has received a refund, fromany source, for the alleged overcharges identified in the ERA audits underlyingthis proceeding;(10) A statement as to whether the applicant or a related firm has filedany other Applications for Refund in this proceeding;(11) A statement as to whether the claimant or a related firm has authorizedany other individual(s) to file an Application for Refund on the claimant'sbehalf in the Murphy proceeding; and(12) The following statement signed by the applicant or a responsible officialof the business or organization claiming the refund: ``I swear [or affirm]that the information submitted is true and accurate to the best of my knowledgeand belief.'' <T3>See</T3> 10 CFR 205.283(c).Applications for Refund should be sent to: Murphy Refund Proceeding, CaseNo. KEF-0095, Office of Hearings and Appeals, Department of Energy, 1000Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20585.All applications must be filed in duplicate and must be postmarked by March31, 1989. A copy of each application will be available for public inspectionin the Public Reference Room of the Office of Hearings and Appeals. Anyapplicant that believes that its application contains confidential informationmust submit two additional copies of its application from which the confidentialinformation has been deleted, together with a statement specifying whythe information is confidential.It Is Therefore Ordered That:(1) Applications for refund from the funds remitted to the Department ofEnergy by Murphy Oil Corporation pursuant to the Consent Order finalizedon February 9, 1987 may now be filed.(2) All applications must be postmarked by March 31, 1989.<ITAG tagnum="6">George B.
