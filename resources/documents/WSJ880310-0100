Perry (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> EXE </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Vice President George Bush, a non-charismatic politician, is almost certainly going to be the Republican presidential nominee. And there's a good chance his Democratic opponent will be Michael Dukakis, the non-electric governor of Massachusetts.    It isn't the kind of match-up to stir the hearts and minds of voters, four political sages reviewing the progress of the campaign all agree.    &quot;It's hard to see an aggressive dynamic about the vice president,&quot; says Kevin Phillips, the GOP theoretician. &quot;There's nothing that's terrifically affirmative or charismatic.&quot; What's working for Mr. Bush, says Mr. Phillips, is &quot;the prospect of drawing Mike Dukakis as an opponent, because there's nothing very affirmative or charismatic about him either.&quot;    Yet the four sages were reluctant to give the Democratic nomination to Mr. Dukakis. Sen. Albert Gore of Tennessee &quot;needs to be watched,&quot; says Peter Hart, the Democratic poll taker. &quot;He could be terribly formidable.&quot;    &quot;He's the new guy on the block,&quot; says John Sears, the GOP strategist. &quot;There's a lot of looseness of support (for the Democratic candidates) so I'd like to be Gore today.&quot;    The four sages -- also attending was Kirk O'Donnell, a Democratic strategist -- joined Wall Street Journal reporters and editors for the second in an occasional series of lunch meetings to discuss how the presidential campaign is going.    The first time, Jan. 13, they all agreed Mr. Bush was running well, but they said he was a weak candidate. Yesterday, after Mr. Bush's extraordinary sweep of Super Tuesday primaries, they saw no reason to change their minds.    &quot;Bush has always been known as a less-than-perfect candidate,&quot; says Mr. Sears, one-time campaign manager for Ronald Reagan.    &quot;There's a tendency now to say the vice president swept everything on Super Tuesday,&quot; says Mr. Hart, the Democratic poll taker, &quot;so that all his problems are behind him. But he has not been tested.&quot;    Even if Mr. Bush wins in Illinois next Tuesday, and Sen. Robert Dole, his last major rival, drops out of the race, Mr. Sears thinks the vice president's work is far from done. &quot;His first political test,&quot; Mr. Sears notes, &quot;will be how effectively he -- not Ronald Reagan -- can draw the party together. How he is able to get everyone to feel comfortable with his leadership. A little thing, too, how he relates to Dole in this situation in another 10 days will be instructive. This is something both men need to get cured.&quot;    Mr. Phillips, the other Republican strategist, isn't so sure he wants Mr. Bush to be successful. &quot;There's a lot of talk 1988 might not be a year to win,&quot; given all the problems -- most of them economic -- the next president will be forced to deal with. &quot;It's not a bad election to lose,&quot; he says. Mr. Bush's challenge, says Mr. Phillips, may be &quot;convincing Republicans he can provide a presidency they can live with.&quot;    Mr. O'Donnell, the Democratic strategist, figures some voters might vote for Mr. Dole just to keep the GOP contest going, particularly if Mr. Bush backs off and begins to take things for granted.    Still another problem is Pat Robertson, the Christian broadcaster, who will come to the GOP convention with his loyal and conservative followers and who will surely try to write a platform in his own image.    &quot;Why,&quot; says Mr. O'Donnell, &quot;Robertson has endorsed the 1984 Republican platform,&quot; a very conservative document with strong planks on social issues that never was given a great deal of scrutiny during the general-election campaign. &quot;It could cause enormous problems&quot; for a new and more moderate candidate, says Mr. Phillips.    Can Mr. Bush hide for the next eight months? &quot;Some guys do it for years,&quot; says Mr. Sears, a ranking authority on President Reagan.    The political experts agree Gov. Dukakis came out of Super Tuesday at the head of the pack. But they say he has problems. Mr. Phillips thinks he may be too boring. Mr. Hart says he lacks &quot;oomph&quot; and doesn't seem able to appeal to blue-collar, working-class voters, a notion Mr. O'Donnell protests.    Mr. O'Donnell, who admires the governor, says that problem is no longer so pressing because Rep. Richard Gephardt of Missouri did so poorly Tuesday. Mr. Gephardt, Mr. O'Donnell notes, is &quot;a proven vote-getter&quot; with blue-collar workers, and now he is no longer a major factor in the nomination race.    The political seers all agree Mr. Gephardt ran into Super Tuesday trouble because he ran out of money to trumpet his trade message at the same time Gov. Dukakis and Sen. Gore were attacking him in negative TV ads for his get-tough position on U.S. trading partners that discriminate against U.S. exports. They also agree that the nightly reports on network TV about Rep. Gephardt were universally negative, and that, they say, played a large part in his downfall.    But it would be a mistake, they agree, to conclude that the trade message itself is a loser. It wasn't given a fair test, they say.    Mr. O'Donnell admits &quot;there's a nagging question about message and whether he (Mr. Dukakis) is reaching people as effectively as he might be able to do.&quot; But he has a great deal going for him. First of all, he's got ready cash &quot;and if there's one thing that can be said about this campaign it's that money matters, and media matters,&quot; says Mr. O'Donnell. Second, &quot;he can identify very strongly with the fact most Americans think this is a very exceptional country with an exceptional role in the world, and he should identify with the future in a hopeful, confident way.&quot;    Mr. O'Donnell believes the big decision for Sen. Gore is deciding &quot;how negative he goes&quot; in trying to draw a distinction between himself as the politician of the future and Gov. Dukakis as the flawed politician of the past.    The other strategists all agree with Mr. Hart when he says the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who also had a good day on Super Tuesday, will be &quot;terribly formidable&quot; in the contests that will take place later this month and in April.    What the Democrats need to fear, says Mr. Phillips, &quot;is the Jacksonization of Democratic economic policy -- his populism, his anti-corporate line, Third World stuff, tax hikes for the rich and famous. In moderation, some of that might actually help the Democrats, but drawing the line is going to be very tricky.&quot;    Mr. Sears says the Republicans' &quot;wildest scenario is that Jackson winds up with more delegates than anyone else,&quot; even though his chances of winning the nomination are one in a million. &quot;That's fraught with real difficulties for the Democrats.&quot;    Is it time the Democratic leadership began criticizing Mr. Jackson for some of his more-radical positions?    Mr. Hart and Mr. O'Donnell, the two Democratic sages, say they would rather pass on that one. </TEXT></DOC>
