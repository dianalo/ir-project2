John Dingell, chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, wants to tighten the rule that investors disclose stock holdings of 5% or more and to lengthen the tender offer period.    The proposals will be part of legislation the Michigan Democrat plans to introduce in the wake of Wall Street's insider-trading scandal. Speaking at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce yesterday, Rep. Dingell said he will soon introduce separate bills addressing insider-trading problems and the general issue of mergers and acquisitions. Similar legislation is being drafted in the Senate.    &quot;Clearly the amount of stock that triggers disclosure is far too high,&quot; Rep. Dingell said. He didn't specify the threshold that will be in his legislative package. Currently, an investor is required to report holdings to the Securities and Exchange Commission after acquiring 5% or more of a company's stock.    The powerful committee chairman also plans to include a provision to extend the tender offer period from the current 20 business days, but he didn't specify how long a period he would seek. &quot;My intention is to increase the time a company has to defend itself,&quot; he said.    Rep. Dingell expressed concern about the &quot;Chinese walls&quot; that are supposed to separate investment banking firms' risk-arbitrage and mergers-and-acquisitions departments. &quot;One of the things we'll look at is to see that the Chinese wall works or those on either side will go their separate ways,&quot; he said.    But Dingell aides said the lawmaker probably wouldn't consider legislation on the matter until his committee's oversight panel completes its probe of insider-trading abuses, including apparent cracks in the &quot;Chinese walls&quot; of some investment banking firms.    Rep. Dingell reiterated his intention to shorten the period before investors must disclose to the SEC stakes of 5% or more. The current 10-day period often allows raiders to make sneak attacks, and it allows unfounded rumors about hostile bids to build. SEC Chairman John Shad also has said he favors shortening the 10-day period.    On separate legislation directed at insider trading rather than acquisitions generally, Rep. Dingell said his goal is &quot;to require more careful and attentive supervision&quot; of employees at securities firms. And he said he supported giving the SEC greater resources. </TEXT></DOC>
