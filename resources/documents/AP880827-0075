Stimsonvisited Phillips Andover Academy and delivered a message to itsblue-blood students.   Stimson, himself an alumnus of the Massachusetts prep school,told the graduating seniors they shouldn't rush into uniform. Thewar would be long, he said, and they should continue theireducation and then fight.   But one of the graduates wasn't persuaded. George Herbert WalkerBush had already made up his mind _ he wanted to fly and he wasgoing into the Navy.   The Republican presidential candidate began his military careeron June 12, 1942, when he enlisted on his 18th birthday.   After 10 months of flight training, Bush became the Navy'syoungest pilot and was sent to the Pacific, where the Navy waswaging a huge war with aircraft carriers to roll back the Japanese.   Based on the carrier San Jacinto, Bush and his two crew membersflew a TBM Avenger, a slow, single-engine bomber. They took part inmissions at Wake Island, Palau, Guam, and Saipan.   On one occasion, the crew had to ditch when the plane _ carryingfour 500-pound bombs _ began leaking oil shortly after taking off.Bush put the plane down tail first and the three men scrambled intoa life raft and paddled away as the bombs detonated.   His closest call came Sept. 2, 1944, when Bush was ordered tobomb a Japanese radio station on Chichi Jima, one of the BoninIslands in the western Pacific. Bush took off shortly after dawnwith his crew members, radioman Jack Delaney and turret gunnerWilliam G. White, a family friend.   ``The flak was the heaviest I'd ever flown into,'' Bush wrotelater in his autobiography. ``The Japanese were ready and waiting;their anti-aircraft guns were set up to nail us as we pushed intoour dives.''   As Bush began his dive, the plane was hit by gunfire. ``Smokepoured into the cockpit and I could see flames rippling across thecrease of the wing, edging toward the fuel tanks.''   Bush kept the plane on target, dropped his bombs, and turnedback to the ocean. With the plane about to explode, he said he toldDelaney and White to bail out and then jumped himself.   Bush probably pulled the rip cord too soon, he admits. His head,and then his parachute, smashed into the plane's tail. When he hitthe water, the only thing he saw was a life raft that was part ofhis shoulder harness. There was no sign of the plane, Delaney, orWhite.   Blood running down his face, his arms aching from jellyfishbites, Bush paddled with his hands away from the Japanese-heldisland, he recounted later. The Japanese sent gunboats after him,but another Avenger chased them off.   Finally, his prayers were answered, Bush said. A submarinesurfaced and it turned out to be American _ the U.S.S. Finback.Bush was rescued.   Bush spent a month on the sub, accompanying it on the rest ofits mission. When he got back to land, he was given theDistinguished Flying Cross.   By the time he returned to the San Jacinto, Bush was in time totake part in the landing on the Philippines.   On Aug, 6, 1945, Bush and his bride of six months, Barbara, wereat Ocean Naval Air Station, Va., preparing for the invasion ofJapan, when word came that the atomic bomb had been dropped onHiroshima.   The war was over for George Bush and millions of otherAmericans. As Bush recounted later, ``We were still young, life layahead of us, and the world was at peace. It was the best of times.''</TEXT></DOC>
