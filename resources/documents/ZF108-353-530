Feed GeoQuery your data and it places eachrecord on the map by ZIP code.andM;Using ZIP codes as map locators has many advantages over using the latitudeand longitude designations that other programs require.andP;  It's easy to lookthem up, there are relatively few of them, and most every corporate databaseis already using them.andM;Without any recoding, your data is ready for GeoQuery, although in most casesyou will have to save it in tab-delimited format for GeoQuery to read it.andO;Version 2.0 has added CL/1 compatibility, which allows GeoQuery to read SQLdatabases directly from a DEC VAX or IBM mainframe.andP;  Surprisingly, GeoQuerycontains no direct link to Helix, Odesta's relational-database program.andM;Odesta claims that 80 percent of all addresses in the United States can beplaced within two miles of their actual location by using the five-digit ZIPcode.andM;The first version of GeoQuery could only plot data as discrete points(&quot;pushpin&quot; plotting).andP;  This capability is useful when specific locations areimportant, such as when finding all the oil wells within a 100-mile radius ofDallas.andP;  But the first version didn't work with aggregate data.andM;Version 2.0 of GeoQuery is able to summarize data in shaded plots thatillustrate such information as which county in Texas has the most oil wells.andO;To see how close refineries are to the most oil-prolific counties, you canview pushpin and shaded views together.andM;If you are using only aggregate data, GeoQuery 2.0 can read files without ZIPcodes, but state or county names are required.andM;Adjusting the map.andP;  To get the underlying map, you choose a GeoQuery atlas.andO;Odesta sells 50 state atlases, six regional U.S.andP;  atlases and threespecialized marketing atlases -- ADI (area of dominant influence), DMA(designated marketing area) and MSA (metropolitan statistical area).andP;  Odestasays that about 50 percent of all GeoQuery owners buy additional atlases.andO;The U.S.andP;  atlas shipped with the program includes census data from 1988, andall atlases will be updated with 1990 census data as soon as it becomesavailable.andM;Information in the state and regional atlases is the same -- countyboundaries and locations of cities over 25,000 in population -- but theboundaries show more detail in the state versions.andP;  The detail level becomesmore important as your custom regions get smaller.andP;  Within GeoQuery, the mapcan be arranged on the page, scaled to any size by miles per inch ordisplayed as a subset of regions.andM;To make your maps more legible, you can add and format text and addlandmarks.andP;  Using the Landmark command, enter a ZIP code and place name, andGeoQuery will put it on the map.andP;  There also is a command to turn data pointsinto landmarks, which detaches a point from its database and conservesmemory.andM;You can hide and show features of a map, import graphics through theClipboard and select display colors for all map contents.andP;  GeoQuery supports32-bit QuickDraw but has no drawing tools.andP;  You must export your maps to adrawing program to give them a more sophisticated polish.andM;Geographical analysis.andP;  The ability to see where things are, whether they arelocations of sales leads or regional offices, is a useful analytical tool initself.andP;  That's why there are so many pushpin-studded maps on office walls.andO;GeoQuery has the obvious advantages of automatic point location and updatingease.andM;GeoQuery also has analytical tools that can verify your observationalsuppositions.andP;  The Analysis menu includes commands to fine-tune the shadingof regions.andP;  You can adjust the selection criteria, the number and boundariesof break points, and specify whether to count, add or average the data.andM;For those accustomed to the analytical tools of spreadsheets, these tools maynot seem like much.andP;  But they are sufficient for most map-display purposes.andO;If you need to massage the data more thoroughly than GeoQuery allows, youmust do it in a spreadsheet or numerical-analysis program first and then usethe results in GeoQuery.andM;There is a report window that lists either the pins selected or a summary ofpins or shades.andP;  The text within the window can be saved and exported toother programs.andP;  Only one report window is displayed and it is rewritten whenthe analysis is changed, which is clumsy for comparison purposes.andO;More-creative window management might also include dynamic updating, so thatyou could sweep across data and see the varying results.andM;Every GeoQuery map has a legend.andP;  You can hide this legend, but you cannotdelete it.andP;  The legend is a key not only to formatting the map, but also tosome analyses.andP;  You can choose subsets by eliminating categories in thelegend or open report views by double-clicking within the legend.andM;Although you can double-click on map points to get data information, youcan't double-click on boundaries or text to set formatting parameters.andM;Performance and support.andP;  Odesta claims that GeoQuery 2.0 is considerablyfaster than the previous version.andP;  We didn't verify this, but found theperformance on a Macintosh II acceptable.andP;  Also, users of the first versioncomplained about its limited capacity.andP;  The program's virtual memory has beenimproved so that a 1-Mbyte MultiFinder partition can handle about 2,500records and each additional megabyte can handle about 7,000 records.andM;For commercial purposes such as mailing lists with more than 100,000 names,this is clearly a limitation.andP;  But Odesta is probably right in claiming that90 percent of applications don't need that many records.andM;Odesta has the admirable policy of offering free unlimited support toregistered users.andP;  Support was busy when we called, but they did call back.andO;There is one manual, which is clear and complete without being verbose.andP;  Thetutorial is helpful, but we wish it used more interesting examples.andM;Uses and abuses.andP;  GeoQuery is not a mapping program in the geographer's senseof the word.andP;  You cannot use it to draw a map.andP;  Professional programs for mapcreation can cost $8,500 or more.andP;  You must use the GeoQuery-specificatlases, which limits you to the United States, and no division smaller thana ZIP code area is available.andM;This is a self-imposed limitation, though, because GeoQuery is not meant foruse in demography.andP;  The program was created as a sales and marketing tool.andO;For this purpose, ease of use is more important than being able to pinpointby latitude and longitude.andM;GeoQuery is for those who already have well-ordered geographic data but arespending too much time trying to visualize it.andP;  The program gives an addedview to existing databases.andP;  On the other hand, it is essentially uselesswithout a database or some collection of location-specific data.andP;  Databasesand spreadsheets supply and massage the data for input into GeoQuery, andlayout and drawing programs customize output for reports and presentations.andM;Conclusions.andP;  With any other program, you couldn't begin to answer many ofthe questions that GeoQuery is best at answering.andP;  For instance: What cityshould my sales representatives live in to be closest to the largestpotential market?andP;  What sales leads should I call on when I visit Crisfield,Md., for the Crab Festival?andM;Geographic data is important for any company with more than one sales region.andO;GeoQuery not only helps keep track of your sales reprepresentatives andcustomers, it helps analyze your performance, set your goals and make yourtravel plans.andM;Odesta Corp. can be reached at P.O.
