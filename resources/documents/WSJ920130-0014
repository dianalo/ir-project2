As part of the president's $72.8 billion research budget,the administration is proposing big increases in suchcommercial technologies as biotechnology, manufacturing,computers, communications and materials processing -- whileholding defense research spending essentially flat. Early inPresident Bush's tenure, the administration shied away frompromoting commercial technologies for fear that wouldconstitute an industrial policy of picking industries forspecial treatment.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;There's a fundamental shift,&quot; said Daniel Burton,executive vice president of the Council on Competitiveness, aprivate group organized by business.   The change in research priorities is partly the result ofthe end of the Cold War. The president's budget calls forcuts in research, development and testing of nuclear weaponsfor the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. Overall, budgetauthority for military Randamp;D would grow only 1%, to $40.5billion.   Military Randamp;D would represent 53% of federal government'sresearch budget. That's down sharply from the peak of theReagan military buildup in fiscal year 1986, when militaryspending took twothirds of all federal research dollars.   But the growing interest in commercial technology alsoreflects fears about the decline of this country'scompetitive position. The new initiatives are designed to&quot;spur innovation and the movement of new products andprocesses from the laboratory to the marketplace,&quot; said AllanBromley, the president's science adviser.   Take biotechnology. The budget touts biotechnology as anindustry that could grow tenfold in the 1990s to about $50billion in annual revenue. To ensure U.S. dominance of thefield, the administration proposes a multi-agency program inbiotech research that would be funded at $4 billion, a 7%increase over current budget authority. The biotech programwould include a 20% increase, to $83 million, for researchinto such environmental products as oil-eating microbes; anda 25% increase, to $124 million, to develop ways tomanufacture chemicals, fuels and other products throughgenetic engineering.   At the same time, the White House is conducting a reviewof biotechnology regulations, as part of its 90-day ban onnew regulation, with an eye toward easing restrictions. Butthe big emphasis on technology could activate opposition fromcritics concerned about potential harm to the environment.Margaret Mellon, a biotechnology specialist at the NationalWildlife Federation, said she fears the White House will pushfor the &quot;broadest relaxation of regulations possible.&quot;   The administration is also pushing a new initiative inmaterials processing, where budget authority would increase10%, to $1.8 billion; and a 23% increase for a supercomputernetwork, to $803 millionconsiderably higher than expected.And in a move that has symbolic meaning for commercialtechnology advocates, the budget provides funds to launch aCritical Technology Institute, which would map strategies forthe U.S. to compete in emerging technologies. Last year, theadministration asked Congress to kill the institute in one ofthe many battles it has fought over industrial policy.   The administration hasn't turned its back on thebig-science projects that dominated the Reagan and early Bushyears. The superconducting supercollider, the world's largestatom-smasher, would get a 34% increase in authorizedspending, to $650 million, and the orbital space stationwould receive an 11% boost, to $2.25 billion.   But the change toward commercial technology is evident inthe waning fortunes of the National Aeronautics and SpaceAdministration, which has long been a favorite of the Bushadministration. NASA would receive only a 2% increase inoutlays, to $14.1 billion, and it would be limited to eightshuttle launches a year through 1996 -- not the dozen annualshuttle missions the agency had been planning.   In addition, the Bush budget plan would cancel a $2billion NASA project to build a new generation of rocketboosters for the space shuttle and an $800 million project tolaunch a robotic spacecraft to tail a comet. (Congress,however, will fight to restore the booster project, which islocated in the district of the chairman of the Houseappropriations committee, Rep. Jamie Whitten, a MississippiDemocrat.)   By contrast, spending by the National Science Foundationwould increase 17%, to $2.7 billion. The NSF would continueits role as a major funder of small-scale science, but itwould also play a big role in investigating advancedmanufacturing -- the next area of commercial technology theadministration wants to bolster.</TEXT></DOC>
