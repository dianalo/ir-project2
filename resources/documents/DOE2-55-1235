The wavenumberspectra for the pressure fluctuations and electrostatic potential fluctuationshave been calculated with spectral analysis techniques. The least-squaresfit of the numerically calculated wavenumber spectrum to a power lawyields a pressure fluctuation spectrum andless;p-italic-tilde{sup 2}andgt;/sub m/{similar_to}m/sup-(2.4//sup +- //sup 0.4)/ and an electrostatic potential fluctuationspectrum andless;phi-tilde{sup 2}andgt;/sub m/{similar_to}m/sup -(4.3//sup +- //sup0.3)/. These results agree with the predictions of the analytic theory.The power-law decay indexes of energylike spectra show the three-dimensionalityof resistive pressure-gradient-driven turbulence, even in a plasma witha strong axial magnetic field. This characteristic of resistive fluidturbulence arises from the important role of the resistivity as an integralpart of plasma turbulence and differentiates the resistive plasma turbulencefrom the homogeneous fluid turbulence.</TEXT></DOC>
