(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Two former PTL aides accused of diverting$1.1 million from the evangelical empire built by Jim Bakker hadauthorization to use ministry credit cards and take out cashadvances, their lawyer argued today.   Brothers David and James Taggart went on trial today on federalcharges they failed to pay $487,000 in income taxes on the amountfrom 1984 to 1987 and spent the money on such personal items as acondominium, jewelry, luxury cars and clothing.   The case is expected to bring out allegations of high living inthe inner sanctum of PTL before Bakker's downfall in a sex and moneyscandal in 1987.   But special prosecutor Joseph Bender told the jury the case isnot about Jim and Tammy Bakker or whether defendants collectedexorbitant salaries or bonuses.   ``It's about the income the defendants failed to pay taxes on,''he said.   In his opening remarks, defense attorney Ben Cotten argued:``This case is not about taxes _ we concede at the outset there aresome taxes owed by David and James. This is a case aboutauthorization, intent and doubt.''   Cotten said witnesses and documents would show that his clientshad authorization from the highest levels of the TV ministry to usePTL funds.   Prosecutors allege that David Taggart, 32, who was Bakker'spersonal aide, and his 35-year-old brother, James, PTL's formerinterior decorator, used PTL credit cards to get big cash advancesand used blank PTL checks to pay American Express bills.   If convicted, each could be sentenced to 25 years in prison andfined more than $1 million.   A grand jury indicted the brothers in December, the same day PTLfounder Bakker and his former top aide, Richard Dortch, wereindicted on charges of mail and wire fraud for allegedly divertingmore than $4 million of PTL money to their own use and conspiring todefraud PTL contributors.   Bakker and Dortch's trial is set for Aug. 28. However, a hearingwas scheduled today on whether to move the trial because of heavypublicity.   U.S. Magistrate Paul Taylor wanted to hold the hearing behindclosed doors, but several news organizations appealed, and anappeals court overruled him.   The witness list in the Taggart trial looks like a ``Who's Who''of TV evangelism.   The prosecution may call evangelists Jerry Falwell, John WesleyFletcher, Rex Humbard and Rex Humbard Jr. Defense witnesses couldinclude Bakker's daughter, Tammy Sue Chapman, and the Rev. AimeeCortese, a former PTL board member.   The Taggarts bought a $660,000 condominium on Fifth Avenue in NewYork and a $317,000 home in Charlotte. In 1986, they gave each otherJaguars as Christmas presents at a cost of nearly $90,000.</TEXT></DOC>
