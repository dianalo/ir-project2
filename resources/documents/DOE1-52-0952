For operation ofbucket wheel excavators, the BPS 500 operation control system is beingtested. Four further operation control systems must be developed: forspreader automation (build-up of spoil banks); movement automation (jointmovement of excavator and spreader); automation of bulk conveying andtransfer; and central process control. Measuring instruments for continuouslycontrolling equipment positions, distances and movements in a range upto 2,000 m and with accuracy of +/- 0.5 m under all meteorological conditionsmust be developed. The principle of electro-optical distance measurementis considered to be suitable for instrument design. 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
