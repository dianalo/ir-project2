The Department recognizesthat the use of a U.S. passport or crossing of an international bordermay not necessarily constitute an element of a Federal or state drug offense.Nonetheless, the Secretary must receive reliable information about oneor both of these circumstances in order to take action under the interimrule. It should be noted, however, that the Department of State has regulationsof general applicability that govern limitations on issuance or extensionof passports. These existing regulations, which come into play when theDepartment receives a copy of a warrant or is otherwise informed of a warrantby a competent authority, apply to a broader range of criminal activityand do not require a showing that the criminal activity at issue involvedthe use of a U.S. passport or the crossing of an international border.As a result, denial or revocation of a passport of an individual contemplatedby the interim rule may alternatively be taken under existing regulations.The Department is also making non-substantive conforming amendments to22 CFR Part 51 to reflect that, in keeping with established policy andprocedure, passport denial or revocation action depends upon receipt bythe Department from a competent authority of supporting information anddocumentation establishing to the satisfaction of the Department that anindividual is subject to the regulations. This policy reflects the viewof the Department that responsible judicial and law enforcement authoritiesare in the best position to identify individuals who should be subjectto passport denial or revocation action. Finally, the interim rule providesthat no administrative review shall be taken of a refusal on the part ofthe Secretary to grant a humanitarian or emergency exception. This approachis consistent with existing passport denial and revocation provisions,which provide for no emergency or humanitarian exceptions. As requiredby the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), it is herebycertified that the iterim rule will not have a significant impact on smallbusiness entities. The provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C.Ch. 35) apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 22 CFR Part 51</ITAG>Passports.For the reasons set forth in the preamble, 22 CFR Part 51 is amended asfollows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 51_PASSPORTS</ITAG>1.
