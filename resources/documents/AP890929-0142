Jiang's 80-minute speech televised live from the Great Hall ofthe People began a weekend of activities that will climax withdances and fireworks on Sunday, National Day. But he gave shortshrift to celebrating the achievements made since Mao Tse-tung'sOct. 1, 1949, proclamation of the People's Republic of China.   Instead, he focused grimly on the themes that have preoccupiedthe leadership in the past few months: stamping out Western liberalinfluences and maintaining vigilance against anti-socialist ideas.   ``Only socialism can save China,'' he said in an unrelentinglyhard-line speech filled with old-fashioned ideological rhetoricthat had gone out of style in recent years.   ``We can borrow some of the methods used by capitalistcountries, but we cannot copy (them). We must clearly distinguishbetween socialist democracy and capitalist democracy ... Extremistdemocracy and anarchism.''   The leaders who used the army to crush the student-led springdemocracy movement have insisted the students' demands for a moreresponsive, accountable government amounted to ``extremistdemocracy.''   Relatively liberal officials, such as then-party chief ZhaoZiyang, who favored compromising with the students, were ousted inthe power struggle.   Martial law imposed in Beijing during the May protests remainsin effect, and already tight security has been tightened furtherfor the holiday. Soldiers with automatic rifles guard Beijing'sTiananmen Square, the center of the student protests where the mainweekend festivities are to be held.   The army issued a new martial law order last week warningagainst any attempts to sabotage the celebrations, but thegovernment has not said if any threats have been delivered.   It was the capital's first National Day under martial law, andthe red banners, bunting and flowers in the center of Beijing didlittle to stir up enthusiasm.   ``National Day? Bah,'' one shopkeeper said when asked how heplanned to spend the holiday Sunday.   ``Some people are anxious because there are soldiers around andthey don't know what they can say and where they can go. So theydecided this year, forget it, they don't care about National Day,''one Chinese woman said.   Jiang's speech, attended by more than 10,000 invited party andgovernment leaders, model workers and soldiers, was not publicizedin advance, possibly as a security measure.   The audience applauded 14 times, cued each time when Jiangraised his voice in a flourish and then paused. But the 62-year-oldparty leader rarely looked up.   He never paused for a drink and his voice soon showed thestrain, nearly cracking when he closed with a call for ``thegreater victories of socialism.''   The top party and government leaders sat behind Jiang on a stageat the front of the hall, decorated with a huge national emblem andthe dates 1949-1989.   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping, whom Jiang praised as the party's``mainstay,'' did not attend. Deng, 85 and reportedly in illhealth, skips most public government and party functions, althoughhe has made several public appearances in the past few weeks.   Jiang said the party triumphed over anti-socialist forces in thestudent-led mass protests, but urged, ``We must carry the strugglethrough to the end ... Isolate and attack the handful of hostileelements, make a thorough investigation into allcounterrevolutionary scheming, remove hidden perils and drawprofound lessons.''   He praised the army for its role in ending the protests, saying,``Without the people's army the people would have nothing.'' Thearmy killed hundreds and possibly thousands of people when itrolled into Beijing in June with tanks and automatic weapons toretake Tiananmen Square from the protesters.   ``The newborn socialist system has experienced twists and turnsin the course of its development,'' Jiang declared. ``However,history has proven the socialist system has great vigor andvitality. The replacement of capitalism with socialism is the greathistorical trend.''   He accused ``international reactionary forces'' of seeking tosubvert the Chinese government by ``fostering blind worship of theWest and spreading Western, capitalist political and economicstyles and ... Rotten thinking and lifestyles.''   The class struggle continues, he warned. ``Every party member,especially the leaders, must maintain a high degree of vigilance.''</TEXT></DOC>
