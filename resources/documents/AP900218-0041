The rope got tangled in cables that had been laid above theprison yard to prevent such escapes, officials at the JusticeMinistry said.   The prisoners' three accomplices in the helicopter escaped,according to the ministry officials, who spoke on condition ofanonymity.   Emile Dieudonne, 38, died after falling 25 feet to the exerciseyard at the Fresnes prison in suburban Paris. Fernando Alonso deCelada of Argentina, also 38, suffered multiple fractures but hislife was not in danger, officials said.   It was not clear whether the two men collaborated in the escapeattempt.   An inidentified man later telephoned the French news agencyAgence France-Presse and said he had participated in the attempt.   He said it had been organized for Dieudonne alone. AFP saidAlonso de Celada grabbed onto Dieudonne's legs as the helicopterstarted to rise and that Dieudonne tried to kick the other prisoneraway before the rope snapped.   Authorities said three unidentified men rented the Alouette IIIhelicopter from an agency in nearby Issy-Les-Moulineaux and pulledguns on the pilot after they were airborne. The pilot was orderedto head for the Fresnes prison and to hover above the prison yard,where about 20 inmates were exercising.   A steel-centered, nylon, mountain-climbing rope was loweredthrough the grill of cables above the prison yard.   Dieudonne and Alonso de Celada grabbed the rope and thehelicopter started to fly away. But the rope apparently caught onthe grillwork and snapped, officials said.   The armed trio then ordered the pilot to land at an empty sportsstadium, where they drove off in a car and remained at large Sundaynight.   Dieudonne, a convicted robber, began serving a 12-year sentencein 1984. Alonso de Celada is serving a life term for two murdersand 20 assaults.</TEXT></DOC>
