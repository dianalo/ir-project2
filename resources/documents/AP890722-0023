Two of the men, Shiv Mohan, 40, of India, and John Townsend, 43,a Briton residing in Australia, were charged Friday with attemptingto export a Digital Equipment Corp. VAX 8700 ``superminicomputer,'' that could be used in the design of nuclearweapons, submarines and missile and radar tracking systems, saidU.S. Attorney Gene Wilson.   Along with a third man, David Whyte, 35, of Canada, they alsowere charged with conspiring to illegally export computer goods andother commodities.   About a dozen federal agents on Friday raided a meeting inBuffalo, N.Y., the three were holding with Robert J. Casperson, aSeattle-area businessman who was acting as a government informant.Investigators seized more than $850,000 they believe was used tofinance the exports, Wilson said.   The three men were in custody and court hearings were scheduledMonday. Wilson said the three probably would be returned within twoweeks to Seattle, where the criminal complaint was lodged.   Allen J. Adrezin, chief export enforcement officer for theCommerce Department in New York, said Mohan, Whyte and Townsendwere believed to be ``major players'' in illegal transfer ofcomputer technology to the Soviet Union.   Mohan is managing director of Koninoor Impex Private Ltd in NewDelhi, a trading house that exports computers and software to theSoviet Union, according to an complaint filed by Jerry Mark Hobbs,a Commerce Department special agent.   The Commerce Department complaint said Mohan and Townsend, headof Computer Acquisition Private Ltd in Newcastle, Australia, paidCasperson and Whyte to act as brokers for computer equipment thatthey planned to ship through Canada. Whyte is sales manager ofCompu-Tech Inc., a Canadian company with a Buffalo office thatofficials said was established to get the equipment from the UnitedStates to Canada.   Mohan and Townsend bought a VAX 8700 valued at $547,000, took itapart and shipped it in 11 containers to a non-existent company inSingapore for reshipment to Mohan's customers in the Soviet bloc,according to the complaint.   Tipped by employees from two freight forwarding companies,department officials notified the U.S. Customs Service, whichintercepted the computer in Singapore, Wilson said.   After a March 29 search of his suburban Seattle firm, C-TekComputers, Casperson agreed to cooperate in the investigation byallowing his telephone conversations with Townsend and Whyte to bemonitored, the complaint said.   In January, Mohan and Townsend allegedly placed orders for 50Tektronix 4225 computer work stations valued at $900,000 that wereto be shipped, illegally, to Mohan's company in India.</TEXT></DOC>
