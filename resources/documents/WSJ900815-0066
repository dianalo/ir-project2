Maybe. &quot;Stagflation?&quot; No.   The American economy has withstood the first shock of theMiddle Eastern crisis without much inflation, and it maycontinue to do so for quite a while. A critical ingredient --inflationary psychology -- is missing.</LP><TEXT>   With the important and visible exception of oil and oilproducts, prices in general have failed to rise since Iraq'sSaddam Hussein stormed Kuwait 13 days ago, plunging the worldinto its first grave crisis since the end of the Cold War.   Many people say the increased costs of oil andpetrochemical products will force up prices on a wide rangeof other consumer and industrial goods, but later -- perhapsthree to six months later -- not now. Oil is crucial toindustrial economies. Certainly if the crisis continues, theprices of practically everything from avocados to Ziploc bagswill reflect the already higher costs of gasoline, heatingoil, fuel oil and petrochemicals.   &quot;There will be some resistance to price hikes,&quot; says NobelPrize-winning economist Paul Samuelson, &quot;but I wouldn'texpect it to be strong enough to prevent the rise fromhappening.&quot;   Still, passing along cost increases -- and even that maybe tough to do in many cases -- hardly amounts to runawayinflation. Among scores of business people and othersinterviewed by The Wall Street Journal in a dozen cities overthe past few days, there was no indication that theself-fulfilling prophecies of inflationary psychology aretaking hold. The classic symptoms are notable only by theirabsence: plans for pre-emptive price increases inanticipation of cost increases, for example, or speculativeinventory ordering in hope of reaping windfall inflationaryprofits in the future.   In fact, many business people think it will be difficultenough simply to pass on their cost increases to customers.Many are taking a wait-and-see attitude toward pricing. Theywait because they see no point in antagonizing customers withprice increases that will be hard to maintain, andpractically impossible to maintain if the Iraqi crisisdissipates quickly.   This time, unlike the energy crunches and inflationarymanias of the 1970s and early 1980s, the economy appears toremain in a fundamentally non-inflationary mode. Whileinventories in many industries are tight, the demand forgoods and services is weak.   Earlier oil shocks struck the Western world in late 1973and in 1979. And the U.S. experienced three years ofdouble-digit inflation as measured by the increase in theConsumer Price Index: 12.3% in 1974, followed by 13.3% in1979 and 12.5% in 1980.   &quot;I think it's different now,&quot; says economist Joel Polkin,a close observer of prices. &quot;The economy is much weaker, andit is not going to be as easy to pass these things {costincreases} through.&quot; Robert Aliber, an economist at theUniversity of Chicago, agrees. &quot;The whole analysis whichcompares the '70s and the '90s is purely on the supply side,&quot;he says. &quot;What it neglects is that with the first two OPEC{Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries} oil shocks,the economy was running full steam.&quot;   This time it isn't.   The Southeast's textile industry is a case in point. It isheavily dependent on synthetics made from petrochemicals, andis quickly affected by cost increases experienced by itssuppliers. But, say officials of Guilford Mills Inc.,Greensboro, N.C., suppliers haven't yet raised prices.Because of weak consumer demand, &quot;It hasn't been anenvironment to raise prices,&quot; says Paul McGarr, senior vicepresident for finance. &quot;We've got a little breathing timebecause our primary suppliers haven't made any move to passincreases along to us.&quot;   BASF Corp., in Parsippany, N.J., is a consumer ofpetrochemical feedstocks that it uses to make fibers forcarpets and clothes, specialty chemicals for home decoratingproducts, and antifreeze. &quot;We are presently negotiating withour suppliers, who are requesting price increases,&quot; saysHelmuth von Moltke, a spokesman for the firm. But the companysays demand for many of its products has been slowing, andmay limit its ability to pass on cost increases.   The demand for nylon in home carpeting is especially weak.&quot;It's tough to increase prices in a weak market,&quot; says Mr.Moltke. &quot;Eventually, nylon prices will have to go up becauseour margins are being squeezed, but the timing is unclear.&quot;   A variety of contractual arrangements protect somebusinesses and their customers from the immediate effect offuel and feedstock increases. Monsanto Co.'s MonsantoChemical Co. subsidiary, for example, the second-largestAmerican nylon producer and the largest producer of acrylicfibers, has contracts that guarantee stable feedstock coststhrough the end of August.   If oil prices stay at their current high levels, &quot;there isno doubt that consumers would see higher prices for apparel,carpet and tires,&quot; says Earl Brasfield, group vice presidentfor fibers at Monsanto Chemical. But weak demand andcompetitive pressures seem likely to delay oil-relatedincreases. Monsanto now believes that price increases inconsumer products, such as acrylic sweaters, would be small.The company says it doesn't know when prices might actuallyrise.   Dow Chemical Co.'s DowBrands Inc., Indianapolis, saysconsumers who use its plastic wraps, Ziploc bags and otherproducts may see no price increases for at least three to sixmonths because of sizable inventories and promotional dealswith distributors. Even then, says Richard Parry, a companyspokesman, increases would be so small -- a few cents apackage -- that consumers would &quot;hardly notice.&quot;   Sherwin-Williams Co., Cleveland, says it has alreadyencountered higher prices on the solvents it buys on thespot, or noncontractual, market. But the chemical andcoatings manufacturer says the Iraq crisis will have topersist for a long time before the company would pass priceincreases on to its paint customers. This is partly becauseit has adequate inventories and partly because much of itsraw material is purchased under contract at lower prices.   In Pittsburgh, Consolidated Natural Gas Co. says long-termcontracts and the slowness with which natural-gas costs willrise in response to oil-price increases have insulated thecompany and its customers.   &quot;If fuel prices stay up, cosmetics prices will go up,&quot;says Richard Heath, chief executive officer of BeauticontrolCosmetics Inc., Dallas. He expects cosmetics price increasesof 2% to 3% -- but not right now. The plastic bottles used topackage cosmetics are made from petrochemicals and, he says,&quot;there are already rumblings about price increases inpackaging.&quot; But, he adds, &quot;our inventories and contracts topurchase are such that we probably have a six-to-seven-monthbarrier against packaging price increases.&quot;   &quot;The economy is weak,&quot; says Ira Silver, chief economistfor J.C. Penney Co., Dallas. &quot;So if we recover our higherenergy costs by raising the price of a sweater, our concernis, nobody is going to buy it.&quot; Penney has already markedprices down this year because of weak demand, and hopes toavoid increases.   Borden Inc., New York, the food and consumer-productscompany, says it is waiting to see if the crisis persists andits competitors act before it will consider raising prices,although its transportation costs have already begun toincrease. &quot;If oil prices keep going up, we'll have to raiseour prices,&quot; a spokesman says, but only as a last resort.&quot;It's a very competitive market place out there,&quot; he says.   Gene Hardy, treasurer of La-Z-Boy Chair Co., Detroit, saysslower home sales and higher interest rates would make ithard for the company to raise prices. Profit margins andearnings have fallen, he says. &quot;The furniture business hasbeen in a recessionary period for almost two years, and wehit the most severe point in the last three months,&quot; he says.When the company does get hit with energy cost increases, headds, it will have to raise prices, perhaps in the fall.   Even if its own costs rise -- and they haven't yet --Wendy's Inc., in Pittsburgh, says they're unlikely to bepassed on to customers. The burger business is engaged in adiscount war, Wendy's says.   Some businessmen have contrived alternatives to priceincreases. In Houston, Sysco Corp. says it tries to offsethigher fuel costs, and avoid higher prices, with cost-cuttingmeasures: for example, by reducing the frequency ofdeliveries that its institutional food service trucks make,and avoiding sending out half-full trucks. &quot;We have no plansto put (price increases) in,&quot; says E. James Lowrey, executivevice president.   Daigle Oil Co., in northern Maine's Aroostook County, istaking a gamble, offering next winter's supply of homeheating oil to its customers at today's prices of only 99.9cents a gallon -- for customers who will pay the estimatedbill up front. In areas like this, where the economy is weak,such promotions are increasing the competitive pressuresagainst price increases. Conversion of home heating furnacesfrom oil-fired to gas-fired, stimulated by last winter'ssharp increase in heating oil prices, has contributed to thecompetitive pressure in New England.   Atlas Van Lines, based in Evansville, Ind., a few days agofiled a 2% rate-increase request with the Interstate CommerceCommission to offset rising fuel prices, says David Steves,agent for the firm's Boston affiliate. But the companydecided against a similar request for higher rates within thestate of Massachusetts because of the soft local economy.&quot;Business is way off in Massachusetts,&quot; he says.   Elsewhere, too, many businessmen expect to absorb costincreases. &quot;We will absorb higher costs until we feel as ifthe prices have stabilized,&quot; says Ed F. Kruse, chairman andchief executive officer of Blue Bell Creameries Inc., inBrenham, Texas. The company is a large regional supplier ofice cream and frozen desserts. &quot;Some people, includingmyself, tend to think that this crisis might be resolved alittler sooner&quot; than the 1973-74 oil crisis, Mr. Kruse says.&quot;We're not going to panic.&quot;   Some trucking firms in the Midwest are refraining frompassing on their cost increases on gasoline and diesel fuel.Jake's Egg andamp; Distributing Co., in Houston, is doing the same,says Sam Sakowitz, a vice president. &quot;The way our pricing andcustomers are,&quot; he says, &quot;the increase in diesel fuel is acost that we absorb, and when it goes down, we'll absorbthat, too.&quot; He adds, &quot;We wouldn't do any business&quot; if Jake'sraised its charges and competitors didn't.   But Greyhound Lines Inc., Dallas, raised fares by 2%Monday to compensate for higher fuel costs.   Eastern Airlines, along with the rest of the airlineindustry, is raising fares to offset higher jet-fuel costs.But then it will turn around and reduce fares in alimited-period fall promotion. Air traffic usually falls offafter Labor Day.   Bush administration economists estimate that a 50% rise inthe price of oil would promote a two-step increase in prices:Higher gasoline and heating oil prices would add 1 percentagepoint to the consumer price index. Indirect effects, as theoil increases filtered through the economy to hamburgercontainers and polyester slacks, would add another percentagepoint.   But those estimates are drawn from the experience of theinflationary 1970s. With the economy already on the verge ofrecession, economists say, businesses will probably find itharder to pass on cost increases.   Lyle Gramley, a former governor of the Federal ReserveBoard, is one of those who observe that the country's currenteconomic predicament differs greatly from the 1970. &quot;It's amuch less inflationary environment,&quot; he says. &quot;People inthose days just gulped and passed on every price increase.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
