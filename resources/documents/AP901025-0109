The decision Wednesday night by a government commission, overthe objections of Brazil's communications secretary, keeps thefacsimile mail machines among imported items banned in an effort toencourage local manufacturers.   Communications Secretary Joel Rauber said it was unfair to keepBrazilians from acquiring imported machines, which cost less thanone-third the price of domestic models.   A thriving industry has sprouted up in smuggled faxes. Federalpolice often make surprise baggage inspections at internationalairports - not for drugs or machineguns, but for faxes and laptopcomputers.   Federal agents also raid offices demanding to see local receiptsfor faxes and computers. If proof of Brazilian manufacture is notforthcoming, police seize the machines.   Rauber had argued that fax machines had become ``part ofeveryday office use and personal communications.''   The government's Computer-and-Automation-Policy Council didn'tget the message.   Science and Technology Secretary Jose Goldemberg, who also isthe head of the council, said allowing imports of faxes would wreckBraziliarm bill after the GATT talks end on Dec. 31.   The National Grange has said the $13.6 billion cut ordered forUSDA programs represented ``unilateral disarmament'' by the UnitedStates in the trade talks. The Grange's national master, RobertBarrow, said the costs of trimming the budget deficit should beborne more equitably.   Rob Nooter of the American Farm Bureau Federation's Washingtonoffice said Wednesday that the farm bill and its tie to the $500billion budget-reduction package is ``certainly going to have animpact on farm income.''   Some of the income lost from reduced deficiency payments will bemade up by other features of the 1990 farm bill, but not all of it,he said.   Federation President Dean Kleckner said last week that he wasn'thappy with all of the farm bill but urged its adoption.   ``Although farm program budget cuts are disproportionate, and weaccept them with great reluctance, the bill will continueagricultural market orientation and give farmers greater plantingflexibility,'' he said.   ---   WASHINGTON (AP) - The 1990 farm law will be a prime topic ofdiscussion as the Agriculture Department unlimbers its annualoutlook conference next month.   It will be the 67th USDA meeting for economists, farm leaders,commodity experts and others to look at what may be forthcoming inthe year ahead. This year's session is Nov. 27-29.   The opening day will include talks by Agriculture SecretaryClayton Yeutter and Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S.Eagleberger, conference officials said Wednesday.   They will be followed by Sidney L. Jones, assistant secretary ofthe treasury for economic policy, who will present the economicoutlook for 1991. USDA officials will discuss prospects forfarmers, consumers and agricultural exports.   Other first-day events will include a panel discussion onEuropean and Soviet Union affairs.   Commodity prospects and the outlook under new farm legislationwill be highlights during the remainder of the conference, alongwith environmental and energy issues.   Among the forecasts will be USDA's first for consumer foodprices in 1991, and its predictions for exports and farm income.   The impact of higher oil prices will be a major factor in the1991 farm income forecast. Energy also will be important in lookingahead at retail food prices.   ---   WASHINGTON (AP) - Production of farm-raised catfish dropped 9percent last month from a year earlier to 27.6 million pounds,according to a monthly report by the Agriculture Department.
