Police in southern Ireland said about a dozen demonstrators wereinvolved in the protest and that after some scuffling with policethey were removed.   The demonstrators continued their protest on the wharf, chantingslogans and singing peace songs, as the guided missile cruiserdocked.   Greenpeace said the Yorktown is a nuclear warship, but RobertWhite, defense attache at the U.S. Embassy in Dublin, told RTE,Ireland's national radio network, it was not carrying nuclearweapons.   A Greenpeace spokeswoman, Orla Ni Eili, said the Yorktown isequipped with anti-submarine rockets capable of firingnuclear-tipped warheads.   ``The immediate dangers to Cork residents with the presence ofsuch a dangerous visitor are horrifying, and evacuation andemergency plans for Cork would not be adequate to deal with anaccident,'' she said.   The Yorktown arrived for a three-day courtesy visit to Cork.</TEXT></DOC>
