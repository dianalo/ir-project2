Employeesof MLandamp;Co. and its subsidiaries could purchase Units in the Partnershiponly if their annualized compensation for 1985 was at least $75,000.2. The general partnership is KECALP Inc. (``KECALP''), a Delaware corporationand a wholly-owned subsidiary of MLandamp;Co. KECALP is responsible for managingand making investment decisions for the Partnership.3. MLandamp;Co. is a holding company organized as a Delaware corporation,which, through its subsidiaries, provides investment, financing, real estate,insurance and related services. MLandamp;Co.'s principal subsidiary, MerrillLynch, Pierce, Fenner andamp; Smith Inc. (``MLPFandamp;S''), is a securitiesfirm and was the selling agent for the Units issued by the Partnership.MLIF, a Delaware corporation, is an indirect subsidiary of MLandamp;Co. thatis engaged in commercial financing transactions.4. Jack Eckerd Corporation (``JEC''), a Florida corporation, is a specialtyretailer. During 1985, Merrill Lynch Capital Markets, an unincorporatedgroup within MLPFandamp;S that conducts the investment banking and underwritingactivities of MLPFandamp;S, structured a leveraged buyout of JEC. As a result,JEC's equity securities are owned by a Delaware corporation organized solelyto effect the leveraged buyout (``Holdings''). Holdings' equity securitiesare owned by members of JEC's management, MLIF and several institutionalinvestors, including certain entities affiliated with MLandamp;Co. or itssubsidiaries. Following full implementation of the buyout, JEC is to bemerged with and into Holdings. MLIF has agreed to sell to the Partnership132,978 of its shares of Class A common stock of Holdings, which represent0.4% of the outstanding Class A shares on a fully diluted basis. MLIF paid$3.76 per share of Holdings on April 30, 1986. No dividends have been declaredon the Class A common stock of Holdings, which shares are not traded ona Securities Exchange or on NASDAQ.5. Enhance is a newly organized company which, through its wholly-ownedsubsidiary, Enhance Reinsurance Company, provides reinsurance to primaryinsurers of municipal and, to a lesser extent, corporate debt securities.During 1986, Enhance engaged in an offering of common stock by means ofa private placement which closed on October 31, 1986. As a result of theoffering, Enhance common stock is owned by members of Enhance's management,MLandamp;Co. and several institutional and individual investors. MLandamp;Co.acquired approximately 22% of the offering at a purchase price of $1,000per share. MLandamp;Co. has agreed to sell to the Partnership 400 of itsshares of Enhance common stock, which represent less than 0.4% of the Enhancecommon stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis. No dividends have beendeclared on the Enhance common stock, which is not traded on a SecuritiesExchange or on NASDAQ.6. Varity (formerly Massey-Ferguson Limited) is a holding company whichthrough subsidiaries, manufacturers, markets and finances the purchaseof farm machinery, industrial machinery, and diesel engines. On May 9,1986, for an aggregate price of $22 million, MLIF acquired certain notesissued by subsidiaries of Varity and certain equity-related securitiesof Varity previously held by one of Varity's lenders. The securities obtainedby MLIF include: senior secured guaranteed notes issued by five of Varity'sNorth American subsidiaries and guaranteed by Varity; Massey Combines Corporation(``MCC'') senior notes and MCC junior notes; Class I Series A senior convertiblepreferred stock; and Varity common stock. Neither MLandamp;Co. nor any ofits subsidiaries is affiliated with any of Varity's other lenders. MLIFhas agreed to sell to the Partnership a package of the foregoing securitiesrepresenting an aggregate of $720,000 of the original purchase price, including$1,035,100 of the senior secured guaranteed notes, $528,000 shares of Varitycommon stock, $51,000 of the MCC senior notes, 23,425 shares of Class ISeries A senior convertible preferred stock, and 24,880 shares of Varitycommon stock, which represent 1.0%, 0.03%, 0.2% and 0.02% of the totalamounts of the securities of the stated type outstanding, respectively,on a fully diluted basis. Subsequently, with the consent of the Partnership,MLIF sold the shares of Class I Series A senior covertible preferred stockand common stock, together with and on the same basis as its own holdingsof such stocks. The proceeds of such sale, together with periodic interest(calculated in the same manner as the carrying costs described in paragraph8, below), principal and dividend payments with respect to the remainingsecurities proposed to be acquired by the Partnership and aggregated approximately$1,280,562 as of October 31, 1988. The remaining securities proposed tobe acquired by the Partnership are not traded on a securities exchangeor on NASDAQ. 7. The price for each of the foregoing investments will be the lower of(i) the fair value of the applicable investment on the date it is acquiredby the Partnership (as determined in good faith by the Board of Directorsof KECALP) or (ii) the cost to MLandamp;Co. or MLIF, as applicable, of purchasingand holding applicable investment. For the purpose of clause (ii), costshall be the original purchase price paid for the applicable investment,plus carrying costs relating to such investment as determined below. 8. Carrying costs shall consist of interest charges from the later of (i)the date the proposed investment was acquired by MLIF or LMandamp;Co., asapplicable, or (ii) the date KECALP approved the Partnerships' purchsaseof the applicable investment, until the date the Partnership acquires theinvestment. Interest charges shall be computed at the lower of (i) theprime commercial lending rate charged by Citibank, N.A. during the applicableperiod or (ii) the effective cost of borrowings by MLandamp;Co. during suchperiod. The effective cost of borrowings by MLandamp;Co. is its actual ``AverageCost of Funds,'' which it calculates on a monthly basis by dividing itsconsolidated financing expenses by the total amount of borrowings duringthis period. 9. With respect to the exemptions from section 17(a) of the 1940 Act andthe approval sought under section 17(d) of the 1940 Act, the Directorsof KECALP will maintain the records required by section 57(f)(3) of the1940 Act and will comply with the provisions of section 57(h) of the 1949Act. All minutes of meetings of the KECALP Board of Directors, includingall procedures adopted by KECALP in connection with its evaluation of investments,will be available for inspection by the limited partners. <ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Request for Relief</ITAG>1. Applicants request an order under section 17(b) of the 1940 Act whichwould conditionally exempt them from section 17(a) of the 1940 Act to (i)permit the sale by MLIF of 132,978 shares of common stock of Holdings tothe Partnership on the terms set forth in the application; (ii) permitthe sale by MLandamp;Co. of 400 shares of common stock of Enhance to thePartnership on the terms set forth in the application; and (iii) permitthe sale by MLIF of a package of notes and proceeds from equity securitiesof Varity to the Partnership on the terms set forth in the application.2. MLandamp;Co. and the Partnership additionally request that the order authorizethe sale by MLandamp;Co. of 400 shares of common stock of Enhance to thePartnership under section 17(d) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Legal Analysis</ITAG>A. Relief Under Section 17(b)1. The relief under section 17(b) of the 1940 Act is justified by boththe terms of the transactions and the fact that the proposed investmentsare not otherwise available to the Partnership. The members of the KECALPBoard are sophisticated and experienced in valuing securities and evaluatingfinancial transactions generally, and have reviewed the proposed investmentsin detail. In this regard, the KECALP Board considered all informationdeemed relevant, including the nature of the investments, and nature ofthe investments by MLandamp;Co., and affiliates of MLandamp;Co., and the fairnessof the purchase prices proposed to be paid by the Partnership. The KECALPBoard determined that the proposed investments by the Partnership willnot directly or indirectly benefit the entities affiliated with MLandamp;Co.,or the subsidiaries of MLandamp;Co. which also acquired interests in theproposed investments. At meetings of the KECALP Board held on April 24,1986, May 12, 1986 and June 3, 1986, the Partnerships investments in Holdings,Enhance and Varity, respectively, were approved after consideration ofeach of the factors set forth in section 17(b) of the 1940 Act. 2. The KECALP Board considered the fact that the proposed purchase pricesto be paid by the Partnership will include carrying costs incurred by affiliatedpersons (i.e., MLandamp;Co. and MLIF) if the fair value of each investmentat the time of acquisition by the Partnership is more than the sum of theoriginal purchase price plus the affiliated person's carrying costs. ThePartnership believes that it is appropriate for it to reimburse affiliatedpersons for carrying costs when the affiliated persons purchased investmentsas, in effect, nominees for the Partnership and the Partnership would havepurchased such investments directly if it had not been necessary to obtainthe relief requested in the application.3. The above-described investments are not otherwise available for purchaseby the Partnership. The KECALP Board approved such investments after reviewof a considerable number of possible investments for the Partnership. ThePartnership thus submits that its investment program will be prejudicedif it is not permitted to make the investments referred to in the application.4. The KECALP Board believes that the proposed investments are consistentwith the rationale underlying the establishment of the Partnership as an``employees' securities company.'' Both the application which led to theKECALP Exemptive order and the Partnership's prospectus indicated thatMLandamp;Co. and its affiliated persons would be involved in structuring,identifying and investing in many of the Partnership's portfolio investments.The Partnership thus submits that the relief requested in the applicationis consistent with the Partnership's purposes and stated policies.B. Relief Under Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-11. The Partnership's proposed investments in Holdings and Varity were structuredprior to the time the KECALP Board approved such investments. However,it was determined prior to completion of the private placement of Enhancecommon stock that it would be desirable for the Partnership to invest insuch stock. Accordingly, the application requests relief under section17(d) of the 1940 Act and Rule 17d-1 thereunder only with respect to theinvestment in Enhance common stock.2. MLandamp;Co. is one of several investors in Enhance common stock, eachof which paid $1,000 per share for such stock. The KECALP Board reviewedthe proposed investment in Enhance and determined that the investment wasconsistent with the Partnership's investment objective and that co-investmentwith MLandamp;Co. would not disadvantage the Partnership in making, maintainingor disposing of its investments. In reaching such determinations, the KECALPBoard recognized that although the purchase price per share would be thesame, MLandamp;Co. and the Partnership would each acquire a different numberof shares. It was recognized that MLandamp;Co. has a larger asset base thanthe Partnership, and at the dates the investments were approved, the Partnership'sasset availability dictated a smaller investment than that made by MLandamp;Co.MLandamp;Co. and the Partnership believe that the purchase of different amountsof shares does not make the investment any less advantageous to eitherparty. To the extent that the investment proves to be successful, MLandamp;Co.and the Partnership will profit equally in proportion to their respectiveinvestments.3. Both the application which led to the KECALP Exemptive Order and thePartnership's prospectus indicated that affiliates of MLandamp;Co. wouldbe involved in identifying and investing in many of the Partnership's portfolioinvestments. The Partnership thus submits that the relief requested isconsistent with the purposes of the Partnership, its stated policies andthe disclosure made to prospective investors.4. The Partnership's purchase of Enhance common stock will not be consummatedunless the KECALP Board determines, following the issuance of the reliefrequested, that the investment in such stock continues to be appropriatefor the Partnership.<ITAG tagnum="84">Applicants' Condition</ITAG>1.
