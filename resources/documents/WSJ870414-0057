In the year-earlier period, CompuTrac had net income of $379,159, or eight cents a share, on revenue of $2.4 million.    The company said sales commitments are about 50% above last year, but said it will only recognize about 30% to 40% of the commitments that it will ship during the period.    CompuTrac, which makes computer systems designed for the legal profession and information-retrieval systems, said the delay in shipments is the result of various factors, including customers being unable to accept delivery until office moves are completed, completion of a pending merger, and delays because of heavy demand from a hardware supplier.    The company said it doesn't expect the drop in its first-quarter earnings to have an impact on its full year. The company said &quot;we anticipate our earnings strength will be in the second half of the year.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
