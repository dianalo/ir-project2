 The program takes up only590K on a hard disk and runs comfortably with 1 megabyte of RAM, making it agood choice for users on a budget.andM;DRAWING TOOLSandM;Blueprint opens to an uncluttered display with a fixed-size drawing window,two floating tool palettes, and a menu bar with some unusual symbols.andP;  Onepalette is a standard set of drawing tools, and the other is a set ofconstraints that modify these tools.andP;  One menu heading, a delta symbol (*),includes items for changes (rotate, move, send, align); another menu (headedby the cryptic symbol = =) includes items for layering, grouping, assigningclasses, and creating symbols.andP;  These are the same menu markers Graphsoftuses in Azimuth (see April '90, page 76) and Mini-Cad+ (see December '89,page 67), which makes these symbols consistently non-standard in allGraphsoft products.andM;Blueprint's drawing window, unlike those of many Mac drawing programs, doesnot have scroll bars.andP;  Instead you use the &quot;pan&quot; tool (a hand cursor) to grabyour drawing and shift it around.andP;  You use arrow keys to jump up or down, orleft or right, half a screen at a time.andP;  The screen automatically scrolls asyou draw beyond its edges.andP;  Zooming is simple: Click on the Zoom In or ZoomOut icon, and drag a rectangle around any desired area to reduce or enlargeit by a factor of 2.andP;  There are keyboard shortcuts and modifiers to changethe zoom factor to 4, but there is no on-screen indication of the currentmagnification -- an omission I found incomprehensible; you should always knowyour current viewing size, especially in a CAD package.andP;  This is made worseby the absence of any rulers at the edges of the drawing.andM;Blueprint supports one geometric entity that is missing from many drawingprograms: the point, or locus.andP;  It is particularly useful for surveyors,cartographers, and other drafters who work with precisely located referencepoints.andP;  You can snap any object to a point, which makes working withreference points easier.andM;Blueprint's treatment of color ranks with the best I have seen in any drawingprogram.andP;  With an 8-bit-video card you have access to the system palette of256 colors.andP;  Colors can be separately assigned to the outline of an object,its solid fill, or the foreground and background of any monochrome fillpattern.andP;  There are 72 fill patterns; 36 of them can be edited and changed --they're saved along with the drawing.andP;  You can also assign one color to allthe objects on a layer.andP;  Unfortunately, the beautiful color palettes arestuck two levels down in a hierarchical menu -- they would be easier to useif they were tear-off or floating palettes.andM;Along with a number of layers limited only by your available RAM, Blueprintlets you create and manipulate object &quot;classes.&quot;andP;  Dimensions are a class bydefault, but you can create classes such as &quot;electrical fixtures,&quot; &quot;hexnuts,&quot; or &quot;parking lots,&quot;  You can hide or gray out members of a class byusing easily accessible dialog boxes.andM;Dimensions in Blueprint are not associative; that is, the text does notautomatically change when you resize the object it refers to.andP;  Dimensions are&quot;autosized,&quot; however; if you select the dimension as well as the object whenyou resize, the dimension text will reflect the change.andM;GETTING IT ON PAPERandM;Blueprint supports very high precision, both for the drawing itself and onthe output device.andP;  On a Linotronic or similar imagesetter, the program candeliver resolution of up to 2,400 dpi.andP;  Since the standard PICT format cannotsave data with such precision, Blueprint also offers the option of exportingdrawings in EPSF, so your drawings can be pasted directly into page-layoutprograms without distortion or loss of accuracy -- a real plus.andM;The MiniCad plotter drivers designed to work with Blueprint are sold as aseparate $300 package, which saves money for users who do not intend to use apen plotter (although some competing products include plotter drivers free).andO;On the other hand, a DXF translator (which imports or exports drawings in theformat used by AutoCAD) is built into Blueprint at no additional cost.andM;Blueprint ships with a 330-page user manual in a three-ring binder and twodisks of sample files and symbol libraries.andP;  The manual provides a glossaryand a comprehensive index, but its pagination is confusing (for example,3A.34b, 3A.7, 3H.17, 4.11).andM;THE BOTTOM LINEandM;In the category of low-cost (less than $800), Mac 2-D-CAD programs designedto run on systems with only 1 megabyte of memory, there are many excellentproducts: Canvas 2.1, Dreams, and PowerDraw, for example.andP;  Blueprint is anewcomer that deserves serious consideration.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
