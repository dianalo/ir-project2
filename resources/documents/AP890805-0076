JohnGlenn was irate. He didn't like a proposal to pay 525 governmentemployees up to $134,250 a year, which is more than senators get.   ``I think we have within this bill the seeds of the destructionof the civil service system of the U.S. government,'' said Glenn,D-Ohio. ``I do not overstate that one iota.''   But the Senate approved the measure anyway, and went on to voteto give law enforcement authorities authority to shoot downairplanes suspected of carrying drugs if the pilots ignore warningshots.   The House voted to remodel the old mansion occupied by Dan andMarilyn Quayle to better accommodate their three children on thethird floor and reversed itself on the question oftaxpayer-supported abortions in the District of Columbia.   So it goes when Congress wants to go. Airplane tickets in hand,the Congress was determined last week to get out of town. Measuresthat might not have survived more leisurely scrutiny got voted upor voted down, but disposed of in any event.   An aide to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee was overheardto observe that Congress wouldn't be here in any part of August ifthe Capitol weren't air conditioned.   Prayed the chaplain when the Senate met Wednesday: ``GraciousFather in Heaven, as inevitable tension builds with cosmic issues,often controversial, occasionally confusing, compounded by therelentless ticking of the clock, grant to Thy servants in theSenate cool heads, warm hearts, patience with each other...''   From time to time a member of Congress arose to warn MiddleEastern terrorists who threatened to kill hostages that Americanpatience had its limits.   President Bush rushed back from an out-of-town speaking swingand moved ships _ always trouble signals _ but denied that he wasin a crisis mode while working single-mindedly on a diplomaticsolution.   Meantime, the Congress did its will, and took a couple ofsurprise turns.   The House, voting on a federal contribution to the city'sbudget, refused to deny the District of Columbia authority to spendpublic funds on abortions for the poor. That move caught all sidesoff guard. Bush said he'd veto the measure if it reached his deskthat way.   Last year, the House had done the opposite, but the SupremeCourt's decision giving states new leeway on abortion haspoliticized the issue. With abortion right sentiment strong inpolls, 22 members changed their minds.   Glenn's ire was aroused by a measure which would raise the payof 525 key technicians and scientists in the Defense and EnergyDepartments in order to keep competititive with private enterprise.Members of Congress, by contrast, get $89,500.   The Senior Executive Association, which, like Glenn, opposespiecemeal raises, went nuclear in its denunciation: ``anill-conceived poisonous stew that will sicken the federal executivecorps.''   Glenn was equally unhappy with another measure giving lawenforcement agents broad authority to bring down planes suspectedof carrying drugs and other contraband.   He said if he were flying and another plane approached him, he'dprobably turn tail and run. He lost again. The Senate approved themeasure by voice vote, sending it, and the pay question, to anuncertain future in the House in the fall.   As for refurbishing the 1894 Victorian vice presidential mansionto meet the needs of the Quayle family, plans originally called forusing privately raised funds. But a House appropriationssubcommittee, after sending staff director Aubrey Gunnels to lookthe situation over, decided to spend public money. The Houseapproved $200,000.   Congress and the White House settled a controversy over whetherthe cost of bailing out the savings and loan industry should beincluded in the deficit, as Democrats wanted, or left out, as Bushinsisted, again threatening a veto.   The question was resolved in a classic Washington way: splittingthe difference. House and Senate conferees decided that 40 percentshould be reflected in the deficit, 60 percent left out.   And while the House waited for the Senate to pass that vitalbill so Congress could quit, it passed the time by passingresolutions.   One designated Sept. 8 as National Pledge of Allegiance Day. Onecommended the people of Sioux City, Iowa for their help when anairliner crashed at their airport. And one _ adopted in the nick oftime _ designated next Tuesday as National Neighborhood Crime WatchDay.</TEXT></DOC>
