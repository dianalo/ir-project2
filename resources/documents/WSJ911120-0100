Yetsomehow no one is surprised that Lawrence Walsh rates 0% inthe major cases reviewed so far by appeals judges.   Federal judges performed a hat trick on Mr. Walsh lastweek. They reversed John Poindexter's guilty verdict, gaveElliott Abrams a light tap as punishment and signaled thatMr. Walsh's latest case against a CIA official is also goingdown. Special Persecutor Walsh needs to head back to Oklahomabefore he gives kangaroo trials a bad name.</LP><TEXT>   Federal appeals judges had no trouble liberating Mr.Poindexter, the pipe-smoking former National Security Councilhead who testified that the Iran-Contra buck stopped withhim. As any prosecutor paid to exercise some discretion wouldhave known, Mr. Walsh's case was flawed for the same reasonhis case against Oliver North was dismissed: Though both menreceived immunity for their forced congressional testimony,Mr. Walsh used this testimony against them in court,violating their constitutional rights.   Judge Douglas Ginsburg said that Mr. Walsh &quot;had a fullopportunity and every incentive&quot; to prove there were notainted witnesses, but couldn't. Along with everyone else inthe country, his witnesses were glued to the televisedhearings.   Judge Ginsburg also warned against prosecutors sodesperate for scalps that they twist criminal laws to meansomething they never said. The immunity issue aside, JudgeGinsburg said that the only conviction of Mr. Poindexterrelating to the Contras was based on Mr. Walsh'sunconstitutionally broad reading of law.   Mr. Poindexter was convicted of &quot;corruptly&quot; obstructingCongress by withholding information. Judge Ginsburg said noone knows what &quot;corruptly&quot; means here. &quot;A penal statute mustdefine the criminal offense with sufficient definiteness thatordinary people can understand what conduct it prohibits,&quot; hesaid. Even liberal Judge Abner Mikva, in his partial dissent,agreed that one of the counts &quot;does sound very much like thepolitical positioning that would stretch the statutory termsbeyond constitutional limits.&quot;   The element of political vendetta that energized theseprosecutions from the first may be one reason judges havedecided that even Mr. Walsh's &quot;victories&quot; will have to bePyrrhic. As Gordon Crovitz notes on the page opposite, Mr.Walsh put Elliott Abrams in the classic Catch-$2.2 million:Plead to something or spend millions defending yourself frommy Budgetless Battalion. When Mr. Abrams agreed to amisdemeanor involving congressional testimony, Judge AubreyRobinson could have sentenced him to years in jail and a hugefine. Instead, he sentenced Mr. Abrams to 100 hours ofcommunity service plus a token fine of $50.   A prediction: Mr. Walsh's next loss will be his caseagainst former CIA official Clair George. Federal Judge RoyceLamberth granted Mr. George's request for voluminousclassified documents that would be required for any trial.Recall that Mr. Walsh had to drop his case against anotherCIA official, Joseph Fernandez, because intelligence officersand judges agreed it was not worth divulgingnational-security secrets. Judge Lamberth, who dismissed someof Mr. Walsh's arguments as &quot;simply disingenuous,&quot; hintedthat here we go again.   &quot;The court seeks to avoid reinventing the wheel,&quot; JudgeLamberth wrote, &quot;and to identify as early as possible whetherthis case can go to trial or whether it will be dismissed assome prior Iran-Contra prosecutions have been.&quot;   What's the problem here? It's that these specialprosecutors are totally unaccountable to anyone withprosecutorial discretion -- and accountable only to partisansin Congress.   Some people have figured out a way to cast a ballotagainst abusive special prosecutors. They send funds to thetargets to even the odds some against the tens of millions oftaxpayer funds spent by Mr. Walsh. Lawyers seem to beparticularly large donors. For John Poindexter, the addressis: Poindexter Defense Fund, c/o Rear Adm. C.A. Hill Jr.,1322 Merrie Ridge Rd., McLean, VA 22101. For Elliott Abrams:Elliott Abrams Legal Defense Fund, c/o Franklin Abrams, Suite5330, One Penn Plaza, New York, NY 10119.   Congress was happy with its monster creation so long asMr. Walsh pinned something to get guilty-plea headlines aboutaides to Ronald Reagan. Now federal appeals judges areissuing the final legal judgments. Hyper-partisan liberalsmust live with the verdict that criminalizing policydifferences doesn't work.
