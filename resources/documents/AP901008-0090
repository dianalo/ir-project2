(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   John Young fears women aren't takinghis approach seriously - he's advertising for a spouse with a signon his car.   ``I've had no takers. Absolutely none,'' the 45-year-olddivorced convenience store manager said Monday. ``Not even a crankcall.''   For two months he's been driving around with a sticker on hiscar trunk reading ``wife wanted'' in block letters, followed by histelephone number.   A few women customers at the Pick Kwik noticed the sign andcommented that it was unique, but that was it.   ``The men scoff at it. They say things like, `What, are youcrazy? I've got one you can have,' '' he said.   ``I think it's being taken lightly, like a joke, rather than aserious attempt at making contact,'' said Young, of nearby Largo.   After four years of marriage, Young was divorced 10 years ago.He doesn't like singles bars - too artificial and noisy, he said.Personal advertisements in magazines have drawn responses fromolder, seemingly desperate women, not what he has in mind.   ``I'm pretty much of a homebody. If you're a mid-40s homebody,alone, what do you do?''   Young, who describes himself as intelligent, sensitive andcurious, said his ideal woman would be intelligent - ``that's thefirst thing'' - with a pretty face. ``And from there on, it's justa matter of chemistry.''   What does he have to offer?   ``I care,'' he said. ``And I'm absolutely serious about it.''</TEXT></DOC>
