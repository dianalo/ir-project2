<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-55-1038 </DOCNO><TEXT>A research plan has been developed for the biogasification of coal basedon the ability of microorganisms to serve as regenerating catalysts.An additional advantage of using microorganisms, besides process considerations,is that the organisms replicate, using readily available materials tocreate a specialized 'catalyst'. The organisms can be modified throughacclimation or through genetic engineering. Supplementary research inthe disciplines of coal structure, gasification, bioprocess engineeringand genetic engineering can be applied to the problems of microbial coalconversion, given the correct interdisciplinary team of researchers.One must consider the implications of existing and future regulatorypolicies in planning a long term research plan. These policies have notyet been confirmed, but are primarily implemented as recommendationsat the current time. One must also consider how workers in this fieldcan affect the regulatory process, so that work under design today canbe compatible with future regulations. 3 refs., 5 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
