At the height of the recent financial crunch, as plummeting landvalues cut sharply into assets, thousands of farmers owed so muchthey couldn't qualify for more credit to pay bills.   With the lid on further credit, farmers often liquidated orculled livestock herds, sold commodities held in storage and tookother steps to reduce debts. As this paydown took effect, banks andother lending institutions have eased back.   As a result, the report said ``credit-worthy farmers should haveample access to operating credit'' for spring planting and otherproduction expenses this year.   ``Farm lenders are optimistic about financial conditions despitethe (1988) drought and do not think it will sidetrack the farmrecovery,'' the report said.   Major farm lending groups reported stronger portfolios in 1988and fewer farm loan delinquencies, loan charge-offs andforeclosures, it said. An exception was the department's FarmersHome Administration, which makes loans to the least creditworthyproducers, but ``indications are that it too is coming to grips''with its problems, the report said.   A major reason for the favorable farm financial outlook this yearwas said to be the continued strength in crop and livestockcommodity sales.   ``Better economic fundamentals also underlie long-run trends inagriculture,'' the report said. ``Farmland markets have improved andthe farm sector balance sheet (of assets and liabilities) hasstabilized.''   Analysts said commodity surpluses are being reduced by lastyear's drought-shriveled crop production and strong demand.   ``The cost-price pressures of the early and mid-1980s have beenalleviated,'' the report added. ``But the farm sector will continueto depend heavily on government payments, and some farms will befinancially threatened because of the drought.''</TEXT></DOC>
