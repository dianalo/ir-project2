Sir James's Hoylake Investments Ltd. said it wouldn'trenew its bid for the London-based tobacco, financialservices, retailing and paper company. Hoylake's original #13billion ($21.31 billion) bid, launched last July, lapsed lastSeptember under British takeover law. Hoylake gave no reasonfor its decision.</LP><TEXT>   But it is clear that the Anglo-French Sir James, one ofthe most flamboyant corporate raiders of the past decade,again has fallen victim to a shift in official and publicattitudes toward hostile bids, particularly highly leveragedproposals. And, as part of the change, individual U.S. statesare increasingly flexing their muscles as anti-takeoverchampions.   Many in the international investment community said thefatal blow against Hoylake was struck in California on April10 when the state insurance commissioner barred a change incontrol of B.A.T's Farmers Group Inc. insurance unit. Hoylakewould have sold Farmers to a French insurance concern,Axa-Midi Assurances, for $4.5 billion if it had won controlof B.A.T. But California insurance commissioner RoxaniGillespie said that the leverage of the deal would haveendangered Farmers.   Taking stock of the changing mood toward hostiletakeovers, Ron Freeman, head of international investmentbanking at Salomon Brothers Inc., said: &quot;In the 1980s, allmergers and acquisitions were good. Now, in some people'sminds, no Mandamp;A is good. Neither position is correct.&quot;   Mr. Freeman, whose firm wasn't involved in the bitter10-month Hoylake-B.A.T fight, added: &quot;The federal courtsystem in the U.S. went too far in one direction, when itsaid that the only relevant constituency was theshareholders. But now states are becoming much more dominant,and are moving in the other direction,&quot; toward protectingcorporate boards and employees.   Moreover, for foreign companies, a hurdle encountered moreoften is the flag-waving sometimes associated with such atakeover attempt. For example, in the $1.64 billion hostilebid by London-based BTR PLC for Worcester, Mass.-based NortonCo., the Union Jack was burned on the steps of Worcester'scity hall last month by Norton workers fearing they wouldlose their jobs if the takeover goes through.   Ironically, it was to escape this wave that Sir Jamescashed in his U.S. chips in 1987 and moved back across theAtlantic to concentrate on European targets. He had beendoused by the first groundswell in 1986 when he abandoned abid for Goodyear Tire andamp; Rubber Co. after workers of theAkron, Ohio, company demonstrated on the U.S. Capitol stepsagainst foreign takeovers.   But the Atlantic has proven no shield for Sir James.Axa-Midi said it would withdraw its change-of-controlapplications in all nine states where Farmers operates. &quot;Weare naturally disappointed,&quot; said Claude Bebear, Axachairman, who added that the French company remains&quot;steadfastly committed to gaining a position in the U.S.insurance market.&quot;   Sir James couldn't be reached for comment.   However, in a conversation last September, he said thathis strategy had gone awry early. The strategy was to launchan all-paper bid, thereby initially avoiding finance fees;get regulatory clearance in the U.S.; and then inject cashinto the bid.   But he said he was surprised at the resistance of stateinsurance regulators. Sir James believed that the insurancecommissioners would be glad to see Farmers divested from atobacco company, and thought that B.A.T would be persona nongrata because of the long fight it had with regulators whenit took over Farmers in 1988.   Sir James conceded that a loss would damage his prestige.&quot;If I lose,&quot; he said, &quot;obviously it's because I made amistake. If you get caught between two cars, it's yourfault.&quot;   At 850 pence a share, the Hoylake bid would have made aB.A.T takeover second in size only to the $25 billionacquisition of RJR Nabisco Inc. by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp;Co. in 1988. Made last July 11 when B.A.T shares were at 694pence, the bid caused the stock to soar as high as 936 pencelast year.   But lately the stock has been receding as Hoylake's hopesgrew dimmer. B.A.T shares closed in London yesterday at 724pence, down 4 pence. The Hoylake announcement was made afterthe market closed.   With 1% of B.A.T, Hoylake has made enough to more thanoffset about #30 million in legal and other costs. But itspaper profit apparently won't approach the $93 million SirJames made when he sold his Goodyear shares back to thecompany in 1986.   The Hoylake bid galvanized B.A.T into making major changesthat the company said it was planning anyway. Reducing itselfto a tobacco/financial-services company, B.A.T among otherthings last Friday sold Marshall Field's, the major Chicagoretailer, to Dayton Hudson Corp. for $1.04 billion, and soonwill sell its Saks Fifth Avenue retail chain.   In typical Sir James style, Hoylake's brief statementconcluded: &quot;The directors of Hoylake wish B.A.T and itsunbundled offspring great success within their newstructures.&quot;   But the changes, a B.A.T spokesman claimed, were &quot;theturning point&quot; in the company's battle against Hoylake.   &quot;I am pleased that Hoylake and Axa-Midi have finallyabandoned their bid,&quot; Patrick Sheehy, B.A.T chairman, saidyesterday. &quot;We can now devote our full attention to runningthe continuing group based on our financial-services andtobacco businesses.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
