About 215 Americans are believed pinned down in hotels in theMakati district, said U.S. Embassy spokesman Jerry Huchel.   Safe passage for the trapped foreigners was delayed Tuesday,although hundreds of others living in the district were able toflee to safer areas amid the most serious coup attempt so faragainst President Corazon Aquino, who took office in February 1986.   Scores of Americans arrived Tuesday at the U.S. Seafront housingcompound, where U.S. Marines were on guard. Others moved to hotelsnear Manila Bay, about five miles west of the fighting.   At least 77 people have been killed and more than 540 woundedsince rebel soldiers launched the coup attempt Friday.   Vice President Salvador Laurel suggested that he, Mrs. Aquinoand Congress all resign, as a means of ending the battle, andschedule new elections.   Reports said the leader of the main pro-Aquino party hadsuggested she dismiss her Cabinet as a gesture to the rebels.   Rafael Alunan, undersecretary of tourism, negotiated for hourswith the leader of rebels in Makati about the foreigners trapped inthree luxury hotels and condominiums.   The talks at the Intercontinental Hotel ended at sunset, andAlunan said they would continue Wednesday. The rebels offeredMonday to let the foreigners leave.   After the negotiations Tuesday, Alunan said: ``They've decidedto postpone ... because it's nightfall and we don't want thetourists to be mistaken for soldiers.'' He said some detailsremained to be settled, but would not be more specific.   Capt. Albert Yen, one of the insurgents, said ``the intention isnot to release Americans.''   ``U.S. meddling has caused the failure of the first wave of ourassault, so we hold them liable,'' Yen said. ``It is theresponsibility of the U.S. government if we take their nationalshostage.''   On Friday, U.S. F-4 Phantom jets flew air cover for loyalistforces, without firing on the rebels, and prevented insurgents fromcontinuing air strikes from Villamor Air Base. They had seized thebase in the first hours of the coup.   Yen said the rebellion was codenamed ``Seven Days and SevenNights in December,'' and would involve a seven-stage operation. Hesaid the takeover of the financial district, which began Saturday,was the second stage.   In Washington, the Bush administration expressed concern for thetrapped Americans and said ``some uncertainty'' remained abouttheir status.   ``You can be assured that the Pentagon has contingency plans foreverything,'' White House spokesman Marlin Fitzwater said. He wouldnot say what additional military steps the United States might take.   In addition to the 400 Scout Rangers in Makati, a similar numberof mutineers still occupied the Mactan Air Base in Cebu, 350 milessouth of Manila.   Brig. Gen. Jose Commendador, leader of the Mactan rebels, saidTuesday there would be a ``nationwide uprising by the military'' ifthe government moved against them.   The coast guard arrested five mutineers on a vessel that arrivedTuesday from Bacolod, 300 miles south of Manila.   Soldiers established roadblocks north of Manila because ofreports that rebel reinforcements were coming. Maj. Gen. AlfredoLim, the Manila police chief, issued ``shoot to kill'' orders formutineers who tried to enter the city in civilian clothes.   In a statement issued Tuesday in Hong Kong, Laurel said thegovernment's resignation would allow for ``a new mandate'' andavert civil war. Although Laurel is vice president, he broke withMrs. Aquino in 1987 and has formed an opposition party.   Gov. Roberto Pagdanganan of Bulacan province said Sen. NeptaliGonzalez, chairman of the pro-Aquino Struggle of the DemocraticFilipino party, suggested in a meeting Monday with the presidentand local officials that she dismiss her Cabinet.   Pagdanganan said most of those present endorsed the proposal,but Mrs. Aquino offered no opinion.   At least two people were killed and 15 wounded in fightingTuesday, including a 6-year-old girl killed when a 60mm mortarround fired by rebels hit a squatter settlement near the MakatiMedical Center.   Continued fighting has strained the economy and weakened publicconfidence.   Banks in Quezon City said withdrawals over the last two dayssurpassed the figures for all of November. Jose Concepcion,secretary of Trade and Industry, announced that Mrs. Aquino hadimposed price ceilings on rice, chicken, pork and cooking fuel.   A statement distributed to news organizations in the name ofcashiered Lt. Col. Gregorio ``Gringo'' Honasan, a fugitive, saidthe rebels did not want to hurt civilians.   ``We would like to emphasize that what we are doing is for thegood of all the Filipino people for the longer term,'' it said.   ``We cannot continue with the present system in which thepolitical, economic and moral fiber of this country is slowly andshamelessly rent apart by the Aquino regime under the shamelesssupport of the U.S. imperialists in the guise of democracy.''   Honasan once supported Mrs. Aquino, but led the strongestprevious attempt to overthrow her, in August 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
