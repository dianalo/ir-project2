While there have been plenty of closed-end municipal bondfunds and closed-end country funds coming to market, untillast month there hadn't been a new diversified equity fund inwell over a year.</LP><TEXT>   But in late August, Merrill Lynch sold 29 million sharesof Jundt Growth Fund, a closed-end fund that will invest ingrowth stocks. However, the fund's shares, which willeventually be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, won'tstart trading for 90 days from the day they were sold.   That's one of the innovations intended to weed outshort-term investors, entice long-term investors, and keepthe fund's shares from falling sharply in the open market asshares of such funds often do.   Prudential Securities fund analyst Ronald Santangelo saidJundt Growth Fund's closest competition is likely to beGeneral American Investors, another fund whose statedobjective is to invest in companies with revenue growth of15% or better a year.   General American has done remarkably well, said Mr.Santangelo, but its shares still trade at a 12% discount totheir underlying value.   Subscribing in a fund's initial public offering is often alosing proposition, at least in the short term. Because aclosed-end fund's offering price includes the underwriter'sfee, initial subscribers pay a premium for the shares. Forexample, initial subscribers who bought less than 2,000shares of Jundt Growth Fund paid $15 a share, but 90 cents ofeach share went to the underwriters, and only $14.10 wentinto the fund.   After transaction costs to invest the money, the fund'snet asset value per share will be far less than $15 a share.Worse, closed-end funds normally trade at some discount totheir net asset value.   Still, closed-end municipal bond funds and country fundsattract enough interest to go public because of rising demandfor tax-free income and the growing popularity of playingstock markets overseas.   But it's becoming increasingly difficult for underwritersto find unschooled individual investors to whom they canmarket closed-end diversified equity funds.   The difficulty has led to some Byzantine arrangements,with brokers -- under pressure to sell closed-end fundofferings -- getting institutions to buy shares in return forfree research or other services. Often, those institutionswould then sell the shares soon after they began trading,knowing that the underwriter would support the share price bybuying stock at the offering price in the open market.   Merrill Lynch hopes that the 90-day trading delay willdiscourage such &quot;flippers,&quot; and alleviate the underwriter'sneed to support the fund's share price when it beginstrading, so they can instead offer break points in pricing,said Theresa Lang, a Merrill Lynch investment banker.   To attract initial investors, the underwriters offereddiscounts for buyers of quantity -- an unusual feature for aclosed-end fund. Buyers of more than 7,000 Jundt Growth Fundshares paid $14.70 a share, while those who bought between2,000 shares and 6,999 shares paid $14.85 a share. The fundreceived the same $14.10 a share in each case, with thedifference coming out of the underwriters' &quot;gross spread.&quot;   Had the shares begun trading immediately after they weresold, there would have been questions about which price tosupport, said Ms. Lang.   The trading delay also gives Jundt andamp; Associates time toinvest the roughly $400 million raised in the offering and toperhaps bring the shares' net asset value up closer to theoffering price by the time the shares begin trading.   As a further incentive, the fund will issue rights toshareholders, allowing them to buy additional shares,commission-free, up to an amount equal to 15% of theirholdings. Shares acquired through the rights will be pricedat their net asset value or the market price, whichever islower. The rights will have a maximum life of 120 days andwill be non-transferable.   &quot;The point of the rights is to give something to investorsin the initial public offering that investors who buy laterwon't be able to get,&quot; said Ms. Lang.   To keep the shares from falling to a big discount, thefund has proposed holding an annual tender offer for all ofthe shares of the fund at their net asset value.</TEXT></DOC>
