This site received ash froma single incinerator without pollution control devices from 1954-1973.Soil was sampled for 10 heavy metals, polychlorinated dibenzodioxins,polychlorinated dibenzofurans, 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodioxin and furan congeners,polychlorinated biphenyls, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. Soilconcentrations for these substances were converted to estimates of exposure,health effects, and/or cancer risk by the application of a general exposuremodel and exposure/effect and exposure/risk models for specific substances.The results of soil analysis and modeling indicate that the level oflead detected on the site was considerably above the recommended levelsof the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and may lead to an elevatedblood lead level in exposed children above that currently defining acase of lead poisoning. The potential for health effects resulting fromexposure to other substances measured in the soil on this site is consideredto be small, and no significant increased cancer risk is expected. Comparisonof levels of various substances obtained at this site with levels obtainedin fresh bottom ash in other studies suggests that these results maybe applicable to exposures from other municipal incinerator bottom ashlandfills.</TEXT></DOC>
