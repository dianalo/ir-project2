HANEY</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An unfortunate mixup in the growth of the brainbefore birth may be responsible for autism, according to researchpublished today.   Researchers who made scans of victims' brains found that onestructure buried deep within the head is often poorly developed.While this may not be the sole cause of autism, it could helpexplain many of the weird and stubborn symptoms of this illness.   Dr. Eric Courchesne and colleagues from Children's HospitalResearch Center in San Diego pinpointed the abnormality in a regionof the cerebellum, which lies at the base of the skull. Thisstructure helps control movement, learning and some kinds ofbehavior.   ``It supports the idea that this is something that happens earlyin development,'' said Dr. Margaret Bauman of Harvard MedicalSchool.   Autism usually becomes apparent early in childhood. Victims arewithdrawn and often mute. Frequently they move and walk oddly,become obsessed with mechanical objects and are overly sensitive tosounds and other distractions. The disorder occurs in about five ofevery 10,000 people.   Courchesne, whose study was published in the New England Journalof Medicine, that in some people with autism, a part of thecerebellum known as the vermis is undersized. He studied 18 people,and in 14 of them, the vermis was 25 percent smaller than usual.   He said he believes that the defect exists in a majority ofautistic people and probably occurs before birth as the brain takesshape inside the womb.   ``Until this study, it was unknown whether or not autism had ananatomical or chemical basis,'' Courchesne said. ``This kind ofevidence makes it clear that at least in a substantial subset ofautism, the disorder is, in fact, anatomical.''   If the newly found abnormality turns out to be a cause ofautism, the discovery could open new approaches for treating thedisorder, which is incurable.   However, many experts believe that autism is actually a group ofsimilar-looking diseases, so no single problem is likely to explainall cases of the disorder.   ``This is potentially a very important finding, because it wouldrepresent a way to assist the diagnosis and also has implicationsas to what might be the cause and the timing of the insult to thebrain,'' said Dr. Edward R. Ritvo of the University of California,Los Angeles.   Courchesne said the defect he discovered could be just one ofmany injuries suffered by the brains of autistic people beforebirth. If so, it might not be the key injury that underlies autism.   However, he said, ``It is possible that this damage isresponsible for some of the symptoms of autism. The cerebellum isin a position to disrupt or affect mechanisms involved in attentionand various kinds of learning and to alter the activity of severalmajor neurotransmitter systems'' of brain chemicals.   The researchers used magnetic resonance scanning, which producescross-section pictures of the head, to pinpoint the differencebetween autistic brains and those of normal people.   Bauman said the defect that Courchesne found is too subtle forscanning to be used routinely to diagnose autism.   She and Ritvo also have found abnormalities in specific cellscalled Purkinje cells in the brain's of autism victims after death.   ``I think the cerebellum is playing a role,'' she said. ``But Ithink there are other parts of the brain that are also involved,such as the limbic system, which has something to do with memory. Ihope people will not say that the problem is now solved.''   In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Fred R. Volkmar and Donald J.Cohen of Yale called the report ``particularly interesting.'' Butthey cautioned that the number of patients tested was small, andtheir brain defect might not be typical of autism victims.</TEXT></DOC>
