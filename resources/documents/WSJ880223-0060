As more big companies seek court protection from creditors, bankruptcy work is becoming more plentiful and profitable.    But the bull market in bankruptcy litigation is starting to provoke a backlash from the bench. In cases across the country, judges are trimming lawyers' fees and denying reimbursement for certain expenses.    U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Blackwell Shelley of Richmond, Va., says the problem frequently is a mob approach to litigation: Law firms &quot;double-team, triple-team and quadruple-team&quot; routine assignments, he says. &quot;It happens all the time.&quot;    Richard Lieb, a New York bankruptcy attorney, blames judges for creating &quot;a spirit of distrust.&quot; He says judges &quot;assume lawyers are asking for too much.&quot;    Some judges display their anger with unusually blunt public reprimands. In the massive Chapter 11 case of A.H. Robins Co., for example, U.S. District Judge Robert Merhige Jr. told lawyers that their fees &quot;border on being utterly ridiculous.&quot; In November, he took the unusual step of ordering an end to all attorney payments until the conclusion of the case.    Before Judge Merhige halted the payments, the lawyers involved in the Robins litigation had collected about $12.2 million for work done since the company sought court protection in August 1985.    But controversy over legal fees isn't limited to mega-cases. In a case in Chicago, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Jack Schmetterer slashed in half the $21,000 in billings for three months of work by Antonow andamp; Fink, a Chicago firm. The judge ruled that Antonow lawyers &quot;had performed very little substantive work&quot; and &quot;had devoted significant time to attending in court to say they had no objections to particular motions.&quot; The firm declines to comment because the case is still pending.    In Philadelphia, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge David Scholl has stirred anger among lawyers for rulings cutting tens of thousands of dollars in fees and expenses. Explaining his tough policy in a recent opinion, Judge Scholl wrote: &quot;The interests of innocent creditors may be sacrificed if funds are distributed to counsel for a fee.&quot;    Emboldened by outspoken judges, some creditors are beginning to protest as well. &quot;The amount of duplication (of legal work) in these cases is outrageous,&quot; says Steven Klein, general counsel of Lewis Galoob Toys Inc. of South San Francisco, Calif. The company has a claim for $390,000 in the Chapter 11 proceedings of Heck's Inc., a department-store chain based in Nitro, W.Va. &quot;The creditors are owed this money,&quot; Mr. Klein says. &quot;It shouldn't just be up for grabs.&quot;    Some bankruptcy specialists predict more vigilant judicial policing in future Chapter 11 proceedings. Thomas Stanton, director of a Justice Department office that assists bankruptcy judges with administrative matters, says that more judges &quot;are trying to figure out ways to make reasonable limits.&quot;    The clash over legal fees in Chapter 11 cases has its roots in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code itself. Traditionally, the bankruptcy bar labored for low pay and got little esteem. Judges stringently controlled fees, and most major firms avoided the field.    The judges enforced a &quot;spirit of economy&quot; because the code allows lawyers for the debtor company and other participants in a Chapter 11 case to draw fees from the same pool of money used to pay creditors and shareholders. Only the court has final authority to regulate those disbursements.    Worried that bankruptcy practice didn't attract enough high-quality lawyers, Congress changed the bankruptcy law in 1978 to instruct judges to approve bigger fees. But with frustrating vagueness, the law said only that payment ought to be &quot;reasonable&quot; and no less than fees available for &quot;comparable service&quot; in other fields.    Frank Kennedy, a professor emeritus at the University of Michigan Law School who helped draft the code revisions, says that &quot;the tension is right there in the law,&quot; because judges didn't get any guidance on how to strike a balance between the interests of lawyers and creditors.    Bankruptcy lawyers argue that many judges have failed to obey Congress's more generous policy. Judges often can't review voluminous fee applications as they pour in. So, in complicated cases, many judges hold back a fraction of the payments requested -- commonly 25% -- until the end of the proceedings.    This practice, lawyers contend, forces law firms to carry large receivables on their books that may never get paid. In the Robins case, the judge held back about $4.2 million before cutting off all payments.    Lawyers also say that zealous -- and expensive -- representation often protects the innocent. Attorneys from the Washington, D.C., office of Cadwalader, Wickersham andamp; Taft, for example, battled stubbornly to increase the settlement for the thousands of women who claim injury from Robins's Dalkon Shield birth-control device.    The firm, which has collected $1.9 million so far, has been criticized by the judge and other participants for its tenacious litigating and bargaining. But some observers credit the hard-line strategy of Cadwalader partner Murray Drabkin for the establishment of a $2.38 billion trust fund for the claimants, more than twice what Robins had estimated as its Shield liability earlier in the case.    Even critics of the bankruptcy bar concede the value of top talent. But they contend it ought to come at a lower price. Norman Oliver, a Justice Department lawyer who assists with the Robins proceedings in Richmond, Va., says Wall Street lawyers should have to leave certain costly practices at home when they venture to other jurisdictions.    &quot;Around here,&quot; Mr. Oliver says, &quot;law firms get done with one man what the New York lawyers do with three or four.&quot; He declines to single out the worst offenders but cites several firms in the Robins case, including Cadwalader and Robins's outside bankruptcy counsel, Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher andamp; Flom, for &quot;atrocious overstaffing&quot; at &quot;many hearings.&quot; Cadwalader and Skadden Arps deny Mr. Oliver's criticism but decline to elaborate publicly.    Mr. Oliver has urged the court to restrict such practices. In one filing, he criticized Berlack, Israels andamp; Liberman, the New York firm representing Robins's outside shareholders, for excessive bills for intra-office conferences. With four lawyers charging separately, the meter on some in-house conferences ran at rates of $565 to $660 an hour, according to Mr. Oliver.    &quot;Such multiple charges are so susceptible (to) abuse as to warrant their complete elimination,&quot; he told the court. Robert Miller, the lead Berlack partner in the Robins case, rejects Mr. Oliver's criticism.    Another area where courts have cracked down is individual hourly rates. Judge Shelley, who has helped supervise the Robins case, says that he and Judge Merhige &quot;probably&quot; will leave in place a cap of $200 an hour for senior partners.    The ceiling has prompted private outrage from attorneys who argue that the rate in New York and Washington ranges from $250 to $300. But Judge Shelley insists that &quot;if $150 an hour is enough for Richmond's best, I don't know that it's fair for a New York firm to charge $300.&quot;    To make a final analysis of the Robins fee applications, Judge Shelley says he may borrow techniques used in the controversial Heck's bankruptcy. In that case, U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Ronald Pearson tracked what each firm requested for certain work performed in order to ferret out billing practices that were &quot;out of line.&quot;    On several occasions, he wrote in an opinion, Berlack, which represented Heck's shareholders, overcharged so egregiously for unnecessary work that he dismissed the firm from the case. A federal district court reversed the dismissal as excessive punishment, instructing Judge Pearson to cut the fees if he considered them too high.    Mr. Miller, who is also the lead Berlack partner in the Heck's case, denies Judge Pearson's criticisms. &quot;If my client says you fight,&quot; he says. &quot;My obligation is to fight the best way I know.&quot; He notes that the Heck's shareholders' committee has consistently supported his being retained.    But Mr. Klein, the general counsel for Galoob Toys, a Heck's creditor, says the backing of the shareholders' committee is irrelevant because the debtor company pays the lawyers' bills.    In Chapter 11, Mr. Klein says, &quot;It almost gets to be an open checkbook. The lawyers feel they have to do everything, and somebody will pay for it.&quot;    ---        Legal Fees in A.H.
