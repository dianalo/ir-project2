Radio Beijing and the Peoples' Central Broadcasting Stationquoted the same reporter, Hu Jiaqi, about the death toll. RadioBeijing also quoted him as saying most of the dead were in Shanmato,a village in Yunnan province that was nearly wiped out by theearthquake, which registered 7.6 on the Richter scale.   Hu's account could not be confirmed independently. An earlierRadio Beijing report said total casualties were 600, including deadand injured.   The State Seismology Bureau in Beijing, which had reported 18killed and 54 injured, said it had no new figures. Dispatches fromthe official news agency Xinhua said at least 37 people were deadand more than 100 injured.   No telephone service was available to the affected part of Yunnanprovince near the Burmese border. It is sparsely inhabited byfarmers, many from the Lahu and Va minorities with their ownlanguages and live in houses of wood and mud.   A Yunnan official reached by telephone said the provincialgovernment had no idea how many people were killed. Asked whether600 was a plausible, he said: ``It might be. It might not be.''   If the death toll of 600 is accurate, this would be China's worstearthquake since the 1976 tremor that hit the northeastern city ofTangshan. Officials say 242,000 died, but unofficial estimates putthe death toll as high as 800,000.   That quake measured 7.8 to 8.2 on the Richter scale, a gauge ofthe energy released by an earthquake. Each number on the scaleindicates a tenfold increase in strength and a temblor of 7 cancause heavy damage in populated areas.   Following Sunday's quake, the State Seismology Bureau said dozensof aftershocks had struck the Yunnan region through Monday night,with the strongst measuring 7.2 but most ranging from 4.0 to 6.0.   Roads to the affected area were cut and Yunnan authoritiesordered an airlift of food, medicine and other relief supplies. Theprovincial government said early Tuesday that doctors had set outfor the area and the governor, He Zhiqiang, was en route.   Xinhua said the national Communist Party Central Committeeordered a delegation led by State Councilor Song Jian to visit thesite and oversee rescue work. It said Premier Li Peng issued astatement expressing sympathy and concern for victims and theirfamilies.   The quake was centered in Yunnan's Lancang and Menglian counties,about 240 miles southwest of the provincial capital Kunming. Xinhuasaid most houses in the two counties were demolished and buildingswere destroyed in 14 surrounding counties.   Roads to the region were cut but crews were working to repairthem, the agency said.   A journalist who has visited the region said many homes werebuilt on stilts because of periodic heavy rains and probably wouldcollapse in such a strong earthquake.   Seismologists in Kunming reported no damage in the city of 1.5million. Three years ago, a quake of 6.3 on the Richter scale killed22 people and injured 300 in Kunming.   A quake of 5.0 occured Oct. 15 in southern Yunnan, whichexperiences tremors frequently, but there were no reports ofcasualties. A powerful temblor hit far western China on Saturday andseismologists said they did not know whether the Yunnan quake wasrelated to it.   The Saturday tremor, measuring 7.0 on the Richter scale, wascentered in an uninhabited area of the Tanggula Mountains in westernQinghai province and northern Tibet. Officials in Qinghai said theyhad no reports of casualties.   China is one of the most earthquake-prone countries andseismologists predicted in 1985 that activity would increase throughthe end of the century. The last major quake was on Aug. 23, 1985,when a temblor of 7.4 killed 71 people and injured 125 in thefar-western Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.</TEXT></DOC>
