The U.S. and its allies have blocked sales of suchhigh-tech gear for years, lest it help Soviet defense. Sovietweapons designers could log onto the computers, says FrankGaffney Jr., a former Pentagon official who currently runs aconservative Washington think-tank.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We've got to be very chary of providing technology thatis manifestly related to military purposes,&quot; he says.   But Mr. Gaffney is fighting a losing battle. A majorliberalization in East-West technology trade is in the worksin Washington, Paris, Bonn, Tokyo and other Western-alliancecapitals. Barring any sudden hitches in superpower relations,Washington appears likely to approve the sale of six ControlData Corp. computers to Moscow to analyze safety at Sovietreactors.   Bush administration officials &quot;are very sympathetic towardtrying to help out&quot; the Soviets on nuclear-power safety, saysa person close to the deliberations. &quot;Nobody wants anotherChernobyl to happen.&quot;   The Control Data order is the first of what is likely tobecome a flow of technology to the East. With the Cold Wardeclared over, a secretive organization of the U.S. and its16 main allies plans to meet June 6-7 in Paris to authorize amajor relaxation in trade restrictions.   For 41 years, the Coordinating Committee for MultilateralExport Controls, or Cocom, has dictated what can be legallyshipped to Communist countries. Though not always fullyenforced, the Cocom guidelines have blocked large-scaleshipments of computers, machine tools and other technologicalproducts to the East, and have hampered Eastern efforts toacquire Western know-how.   At the Paris meeting, Western officials plan to maintainthe embargo on key technologies but deregulate trade in manyothers. East Germany, several Cocom participants say, willlikely be designated a special trade zone, freed from all butthe most important controls. West German companies will beable to export products to East Germany except those withobvious military uses, such as certain radars, ultrasonicsensors for ships and supercomputers. The plan risks allowingre-export to other Eastern countries, but it is motivated bypragmatism. With the two Germanys unifying, says one Bonnofficial, customs officials couldn't successfully police theold, strict embargo.   The East-bloc countries will also get new tradeprivileges, though not as great as East Germany. Cocomnegotiators tentatively have agreed to allow unregulatedtrade in most personal computers, up to 386-model PCs with adata-processing speed of 275 megabits a second; that is anearly four-fold rise in Cocom standards.   More important, the negotiators plan to grant &quot;favorableconsideration&quot; on a case-by-case basis to licensing shipmentsof more-powerful computers with processing speeds up to 1,000megabits; that covers all PCs, most engineering workstationsand minicomputers, and many mainframe computers. Stillundecided is whether to go even further for Poland, Hungaryand Czechoslovakia, to a processing speed of 2,000 megabits,covering all models except supercomputers and specialmainframes with so-called vector arrays for high-speed numbercrunching.   Next week's Paris meeting will also deregulate trade inmany telecommunications products and machine tools; otherproducts may be liberalized later this year. The Parismeeting, though important, &quot;is just the beginning,&quot; saysanother European government official.   In 1987, the U.S., Japan, Britain, France, Italy and WestGermany shipped $1.12 billion of technology products to theSoviet Union and its allies, according to a recent study bythe Economist Intelligence Unit, a London-based consultingfirm. About a third of that was in computers; nearly half wasfrom West Germany. Some economists forecast a doubling ofEast-West trade.   One certain, immediate result of Cocom liberalization willbe a further surge in joint ventures between East and Westtechnology companies. Such ventures cost the East-bloccompanies little, and offer Western ones a chance to cash inlater on a reconstructed East. U.S. computer-maker DigitalEquipment Corp., for instance, began its first East-blocventure three months ago in Hungary. With Cocomliberalization coming, &quot;We plan to be moving aggressivelyinto the rest of Eastern Europe,&quot; a spokesman says.   &quot;U.S. companies that come in {to the Soviet Union} forjoint ventures don't want to mess around with Soviet junk&quot;for computers, says William McHenry, a specialist in Sovietcomputing at Georgetown University's School of BusinessAdministration.   But it isn't all junk in East-bloc computing. The Sovietsmake mainframe computers that approach Western speeds, andthe Bulgarians make a supercomputer. But Eastern computersbreak down easily, are scarce, and often can't useperformance-boosting Western software. Mr. McHenry saysSoviet mainframes typically need repairs after running for250 to 500 hours, a fraction of Western standards. Heestimates the Soviets have 500,000 to one million PCs; theU.S. has about 40 million.   Thus, even a relatively modest rise in East-West computertrade could make a big difference to some Soviet industries.The Soviet nuclear-power industry is a prime example. At theIgnalina nuclear-power station in Lithuania, operators relyon a Soviet SM-2 computer system that was already six yearsbehind the West when it was installed in 1981. At areactor-training school in Smolensk, operators learn accidentresponses on a computer simulator that runs at five millioninstructions a second, the power of a moderate Western PC,Soviet officials say.   Indeed, Western and Soviet nuclear experts say inadequatecomputers contributed to the 1986 Chernobyl accident. SaysNikolai Shteinberg, deputy chairman of the U.S.S.R. StateCommittee on Supervision of Nuclear Power Safety: &quot;If theplant personnel had had enough information {from computers}on what was happening, I guarantee there would have been noaccident&quot; at Chernobyl.   The Control Data order is for six Cyber 962 mainframes,five for the country's main reactor-design labs and the sixthfor post-accident research at Chernobyl itself. Mr. Gaffney,the ex-Pentagon official, contends the computers could end upbeing used by military researchers.   But Control Data says it plans safeguards against suchmisuse. These include having company staff visit thecomputers to check for signs of military usage, and may alsoinclude a software &quot;log&quot; to record the number-crunching beingperformed on a machine. Such measures, a spokesman concedes,can't guarantee against misuse, but they reduce the odds ofit going undetected.   ---                      Technology Trade                     With the East Bloc           (1987 exports in millions of dollars)                                                                                                                                      ALL TECHNOLOGY   EXPORTER                           EXPERTS    COMPUTERS                                                                                                          U.S.                                $ 65.8       $ 11.0   Japan                                235.1         34.0   France                               158.3         45.9   West Germany                         447.0        174.6   Italy                                 74.8         22.3   U.K.                                 141.3         52.9                                                                                                          Sources: OECD and Economist Intelligence Unit</TEXT></DOC>
