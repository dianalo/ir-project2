The planned changes &quot;will be the most important piece of fiscal policy introduced in Canada in 15 years,&quot; said Michael Manford, chief economist of Merrill Lynch Canada Inc.    The changes are designed to keep Canada's taxation system competitive with the new U.S. tax rules, which have cut corporate and personal income tax rates. They are also designed to increase the system's efficiency and fairness.    Some of the measures will take effect immediately, subject to Parliament later enacting the necessary authorization legislation.    The planned new federal sales tax will apply to the value added to goods and services as they move through the production chain to the consumer. It represents a major shift toward consumption taxes as a source of government revenue. Canada has had a federal sales tax for 63 years, but the existing levy applies to only about one-third of consumer expenditures.    To ease the impact of the new sales tax on lower income Canadians, the government is expected to propose a substantial sales tax credit.    The government also will propose reducing corporate and personal income tax rates, and eliminating or reducing various tax breaks. Many more companies are expected to pay taxes as a result of the changes. Currently only about half of Canada's companies pay taxes.    The number of personal-income tax rates will be reduced to three from 10, and tax credits, which are of greater benefit to low-income taxpayers, will replace some tax exemptions.    A government official predicted the new corporate and personal income tax rates will be competitive with the new U.S. rates, but he declined to be more specific. The government has been concerned that, if Canada didn't respond promptly to the U.S. tax overhaul, lower U.S. rates would attract investment and jobs away from Canada.    Thomas d'Aquino, president of the Business Council on National Issues, said Canada either must move in a similar direction as the U.S. &quot;or we run the risk of losing some of our best people and important sources of investment to the Americans.&quot;    The revenue gains and losses from the tax changes are expected to offset each other. Senior government officials said the revenue estimates in the plan are deliberately conservative in order not to provoke a skeptical reaction from the financial markets. If the measures succeed in reducing tax evasion, he said the revenue gains may be higher than forecast. </TEXT></DOC>
