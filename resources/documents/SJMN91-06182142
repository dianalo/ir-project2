Do you know where your United States senator is?;   Not to worry. He's strapped on his six-shooters, his boots, 10-gallon hat andsheriff's badge.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Perspective  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  SENATORS STAGE GUNFIGHT AT THE U.S. CAPITOLCORRAL  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  Points of ViewSandy Grady is a columnist in the Mercury News Washington Bureau.  </MEMO><TEXT>     He's playing a gun-totin' combination of Clint Eastwood, James Arness andJohn Wayne -- a one-man posse fighting against crime.;    Or maybe he's justdozing in the cloakroom. Middle-aged vigilantes need their zzz's.;    For 14hours Wednesday -- in one of those wonderful examples of why Americans snickerat politicians -- the Senate pulled on its gun belts and became CrimebustersInc.;    And that was before Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., turned thecrime-hunting posse into midnight farce.;    Ostensibly, this was thelong-awaited debate over George Bush's crime bill. Never mind that local cops,not feds, handle 95 percent of law enforcement. Or that the Senate's endlessvolley of words over crime sounded suspiciously like 100 politicians joustingfor the 1992 campaign.;    Namely: Which party has the most macho hangmen?;   Maybe it should have been packaged as the &quot;Fry 'Em Quick Bill.&quot;;    As Bushworked the phones, the Senate expanded the death penalty to 50 crimes,including the slaying of any federal honcho from president to poultryinspectors.;    Just to make sure no villain delays his trip to the fryer,noose or gas chamber, the Senate sharply limited appeals by death-row inmates.Sure, 40 percent of death penalty cases are overturned on appeal. Bush and thehard-liners won a big victory over death-row dilly-dallying.;    &quot;No more TedBundys,&quot; demanded Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, citing the serial killer who putoff his execution 10 years.;    But the long day, as senators railed againstcrime for the cameras, gnawed on nerves.;    &quot;This debate is a load ofbaloney,&quot; shouted Sen. Patrick J. Leahy, D-Vt., a former prosecutor. &quot;It's acruel hoax. We can't be sheriffs for 50 states. Why don't we stop thesymbolism and the posing for 30-second TV spots?&quot;;    At that moment, Helms,Dixie provocateur and master of the 30-second ad, threw his racial firebombinto the Senate.;    Helms hung an amendment onto the crime bill that wouldoutlaw racial job quotas. This classic Helms surprise attack -- grabbing thespotlight with a complex racial issue -- threw the Senate into a Keystone Kopsdrill.;    &quot;Come on, show a little courage,&quot; Helms taunted Democrats. &quot;This isa clear-cut vote against quotas.&quot;;    &quot;This is done for one purpose, todisrupt and delay,&quot; said Sen. Wyche Fowler, D-Ga.;    &quot;You can televise thoParty leaders on both sides cornered Helms, trying to coax him to relent.C'mon, Jesse, wait for the civil rights bill. But Helms had his own logic --quotas were a crime. By 11:15 p.m., Helms wore his opponents into exhaustion.;   &quot;No one knows what this amendment means,&quot; said Senate Majority LeaderGeorge Mitchell, D-Maine, desperately. &quot;What do quotas have to do crime?&quot;;   &quot;This is politics, trying to deny me a vote,&quot; fumed Helms. &quot;What the courtsare doing to small businesses (with quotas) is a crime.&quot;;    Then -- as Helmsrubbed his palms and exulted, &quot;I've waited for this all day&quot; -- the Senatereluctantly voted, and knocked out Jesse's quota foolishness, 70-28.;    ButHelms' ego trip was in character with these congressional crime bills thatturn into yearly charades.;    &quot;We put up massive amounts for new prisons,policemen and FBI agents,&quot; said Arkansas' Bumpers wearily. &quot;We've been doingthat long as I've been here. We've got more people in prisons than any nationon Earth, including the Soviets, China and South Africa. But our crime ratekeeps going up -- we're the crime capital of the world.&quot;;    Maybe there aredeeper reasons, but they don't fit 30-second ads.;    Groggy and soured withits tough-guy rhetoric, the Senate called it a night at 12:15 a.m. It hadbuilt more jails, added 50 more death penalties, and given Jesse Helms hismoment of spiteful theater.;    The 100 macho sheriffs hung up their badges.Maybe the cynical ex-Vermont lawman, Leahy, was right.;    Any way you slicedthe crime bill, it was political baloney.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Sandy Grady column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  WASHINGTON  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910630  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Sunday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  3C  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  697  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Sunday June 30, 199100182142,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
