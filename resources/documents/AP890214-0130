She also remained firm in her refusal to let ailing formerPresident Ferdinand Marcos return from exile in Hawaii, citingsecurity reasons.   The chief executive announced her decisions after a nearlythree-hour meeting Tuesday with the Cabinet crisis committee.   She said they discussed security measures for her trip thisweekend to the Philippine Military Academy, where she is to addressthe graduating class, and her visit to Japan next week to attend thefuneral of Emperor Hirohito.   ``The committee agreed my presence at these two events would beadvantageous to our country,'' Mrs. Aquino said in a statement.   Military officials said only members of the presidential securityforce would be allowed to carry weapons on the academy campus inBaguio City, about 150 miles north of Manila, during the festivitiesfrom Friday to Sunday.   Banners will be banned on graduation day Sunday. Last yeargraduates waved banners reading ``We belong,'' the slogan of theReform the Armed Forces Movement which has figured in unsuccessfulattempts to unseat Mrs. Aquino.   Two years ago, a bomb exploded at the academy grandstand a fewdays before Mrs. Aquino was to address graduating cadets, killingfour people. She said the bomb was meant for her.   Reports of a new coup plot surfaced last week, but military chiefGen. Renato de Villa said his command received no such information.But he said former Lt. Col. Gregorio Honasan and two other renegadeofficers linked to previous coup attempts had held a secret meeting,apparently to join forces.   Honasan led an August 1987 coup attempt, which killed 53 peopleand wounded hundreds.   Mrs. Aquino leaves for Japan on Feb. 23, but she is expected tobe back in time for the third anniversary of the Feb. 25civilian-military uprising that drove Marcos into exile and broughther to power.   She said: ``With regard to ex-President Ferdinand Marcos, myposition remains the same. Considerations of the highest nationalgood dictate that we preserve the substantial economic and politicalgains of the past three years.   ``My duty is paramount: to preserve democracy and itsinstitutions. I must therefore decline the wishes of some peoplethat Mr. Marcos be allowed to return to the Philippines.''   Marcos' only son, Ferdinand Jr., and Vice President SalvadorLaurel were among those who appealed to her to heed Marcos' requestto come home.   Marcos, 71, was reported in guarded condition at the St. FrancisMedical Center in Honolulu after suffering a relapse of pneumonia.   Marcos is under U.S. indictment with his wife Imelda, accused ofstealing more than $100 million from his homeland and stashing muchof the money in the United States.   On Tuesday, Justice Secretary Sedfrey Ordonez brushed asidereports of negotiations for Marcos' return, saying Marcos first hadto resolve criminal charges pending against him in the United States.   A presidential commission has been charged with recovering up to$10 billion that the Aquino government claims Marcos, his family andassociates plundered from the country during his 20-year rule.Marcos faces 39 civil suits in Manila, but no criminal charges havebeen filed.</TEXT></DOC>
