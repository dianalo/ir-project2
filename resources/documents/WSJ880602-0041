The strong quarter-to-quarter growth in GNP, which measures the nation's output of goods and services, outpaced increases of 0.5% in each of the two preceding quarters. It is likely to quell recurrent suggestions from Germany's trading partners and its own industry that Bonn take further fiscal and monetary steps to stimulate the economy, and to reinforce the recent U.S. strategy of instead focusing on issues such as deregulation.    &quot;This is very likely to shift away criticism,&quot; said Mushtaq Shah, an economist for Phillips andamp; Drew in London. In particular, it will reinforce government resistance to accelerating a net 20 billion-mark ($11.6 billion) tax reduction planned for 1990, he said.    The first-quarter growth came amid one of the warmest winters in memory, which generated a 20% surge in construction spending from the year-earlier quarter. &quot;Extraordinarily favorable weather this year hindered construction activity substantially less than in the first months of 1987,&quot; the statistics office said.    The office also cited strong growth in private consumption, which accounts for more than half of Germany's domestic demand. Private spending rose 4.6% from the 1987 first quarter, while German consumers' disposable income increased 4.4%. By comparison, public-sector spending rose 1.8% from a year ago.    The Economics Ministry conceded that the first-quarter GNP figures were influenced by &quot;special factors&quot; but asserted that the result nonetheless supports Bonn's prediction that GNP will grow at least 2% in 1988. German GNP expanded a price-adjusted 1.7% in 1987.    In recent months, signs of a robust first quarter caused many economists to raise their 1988 growth forecasts from around 1.5% to levels more in line with the government's expectations, earlier dismissed as too optimistic.    &quot;The weather was a major factor, but private demand appears to be reacting favorably to the (central bank's) expansive monetary policy,&quot; said Peter Trapp, an economist with the IfW Institute for World Economic Research in Kiel. &quot;Even after factoring out the weather, the economy still is in a mild growth trend that exceeds what many had expected.&quot;    However, he predicted slower growth in the next few quarters. &quot;And in 1989, the planned increases in consumer taxes will have a braking effect,&quot; he said, referring to government plans to raise an additional five billion marks in sales-tax revenue to help finance its 1990 income-tax cuts.    Another troubling point has been a slackening in industrial investment. Figures on industry's spending were omitted from the first-quarter data because of statistical delays in the compilation of German trade figures for March. Economists widely believe that German industrial investments are stagnating, reflecting a cyclical slowdown after five years of growth and corporate response to the high costs of production in Germany.    &quot;We haven't recorded significant growth in capital expenditure by industry, which is the key element if you want more economic growth and a reduction in unemployment,&quot; Mr. Trapp said. Despite the recent economic expansion, German unemployment has remained stubbornly high, standing at 8.9% of the labor force in April. </TEXT></DOC>
