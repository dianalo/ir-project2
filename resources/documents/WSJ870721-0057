John Poindexter testified that he authorized the diversion of arms-sales profits to the Contras after only &quot;several minutes'&quot; thought, and in the following months never tried to find out how much of the money reached the insurgents.    &quot;That is a detail I didn't get into,&quot; said the former national security adviser, who was unable to give any explanation of the disposition of $6 million in proceeds identified in a National Security Council memo written to him in May 1986.    The naval officer testified that the funds were handled entirely by the private network overseen by his former assistant, Marine Lt. Col. Oliver North. The admiral also admitted that he was being told the &quot;enterprise&quot; had losses at a time when records show that funds were siphoned off into capital accounts for the operation.    Adm. Poindexter's remarks underscore the continued uncertainty surrounding the secret transfer of funds, which he has defended as vital for the Contras. Unbowed in his fourth day of testimony before House and Senate committees investigating the Iran-Contra affair, the former NSC adviser made few concessions and carried himself with self-assurance.    &quot;I don't have any regrets for anything I did,&quot; he said in a sharp exchange with Republican Sen. Paul Trible of Virginia. &quot;I think the actions I took were in the long-term interests of the country, and I'm not going to change my mind. I'm not going to be apologetic about it.&quot;    The admiral held to his position that he acted within his authority by not notifying President Reagan of the diversion. And his thinly veiled disdain for Congress proved too much even for conservatives, such as Rep. Richard Cheney of the House GOP leadership.    &quot;The reason for not misleading Congress is a very practical one. It's stupid,&quot; said the Wyoming Republican. &quot;It's self-defeating. Because while it may in fact allow you to prevail in the problem of the moment, eventually you destroy the president's credibility.&quot;    Under questioning by Sen. George Mitchell (D., Maine), Adm. Poindexter said his testimony isn't part of any arrangement with other witnesses or administration officials. Rep. Louis Stokes (D., Ohio) said, however, that President Reagan, Attorney General Edwin Meese and former White House Chief of Staff Donald Regan met last Dec. 16, less than a month after Adm. Poindexter resigned, and discussed granting either a presidential pardon or congressional immunity to both the former national security adviser and Col. North.    Rep. Stokes refused to discuss the White House meeting further, but said information about it will be revealed later in the hearings. Adm. Poindexter said he hasn't discussed the possibility of either a pardon or immunity with anyone in the administration.    The revelation of the meeting came as Adm. Poindexter was questioned about a luncheon he attended last Nov. 22 with Col. North, and former Central Intelligence Agency Director William Casey.    The naval officer said he couldn't recall any details of the lunch, which occurred during the attorney general's preliminary investigation into the Iran-Contra affair. The three men who were so crucial to the covert operations were meeting as Mr. Meese was having lunch with his aides and learning for the first time of an April 1986 memo by Col. North about the diversion.    Records show the diversion began in February 1986 with the first direct sales of U.S. weapons to Iran by the Reagan administration. In the most detailed account yet of the decision to divert funds to the Contras, Adm. Poindexter said the idea was brought to him by Col. North late in an afternoon meeting on the Iran initiative. &quot;I thought about it for several moments while he was standing there,&quot; said the admiral. &quot;At the end of the conversation, I told Col. North to go ahead.&quot;    The view that the arms proceeds might be considered government funds never entered &quot;the equation,&quot; said the naval officer, who made a judgment that the operation was legal without consulting a lawyer. A major motivation was the need to keep the Contras supplied until Congress renewed the aid, but neither Adm. Poindexter nor Col. North has been able to give the committees any detailed accounting of the funds they judged so vital.    That lack of knowledge was most apparent in Mr. Poindexter's testimony yesterday. The admiral said that Col. North frequently told him that the private network operated by retired Air Force Maj. Gen. Richard Secord was faced with losses.    Adm. Poindexter indicated that Col. North had sought his assistance in helping Gen. Secord sell the network's planes and materials to the CIA, and the admiral said he had spoken to then-CIA Deputy Director Robert Gates about the matter.    &quot;I didn't get into the details with Mr. Gates whether it would be purchased or given,&quot; said the admiral. However, documents previously released by the committees outline a proposal in which the CIA would lease the assets or pay an estimated $4.5 million to acquire them from Gen. Secord.    Though the transaction was never carried out, Col. North has testified that Mr. Casey also supported it.    While there was a substantial drop in funds for the enterprise in September and August of 1986, when supply flights increased on behalf of the Contras, financial records show that sizable sums were also being set aside during this period by Gen. Secord's partner, Albert Hakim. When the operation ended last fall, an estimated $8 million remained in foreign accounts controlled by the network, and the full sum diverted to the Contras over the prior months was less than half this total.    As the public hearings into the Iran-Contra affair near a close, some members of the congressional committees are conceding that they may never know exactly what happened. &quot;I think it's clear that when we file our final report, there will be a lot of pieces that are missing in the jigsaw puzzle,&quot; Sen. Daniel Inouye (D., Hawaii) told a group of reporters.    Sen. Inouye and other members of the panels also said they may never resolve all the contradictions in the testimony of Adm. Poindexter, Col. North and other witnesses. &quot;I can tell you that what I've heard is mind-boggling,&quot; Sen. Inouye said. &quot;I don't want to be caught saying someone is lying. So far I have yet to say that any witness is lying, even if deep in my heart I believe so.&quot;    House committee member Les Aspin (D., Wis.) yesterday suggested that the Contras may have received aid last year from sources that still haven't been disclosed. He said that the aid provided to the Contras from known sources -- including the diversion, third countries, and the nonlethal assistance from the State Department -- wasn't enough to sustain the insurgents from March through October of last year, when U.S. military aid resumed.    Citing his own study of the Contras' finances, Rep. Aspin said that until February 1986, the insurgents received an average of $3.5 million a month. But during the next eight months, he said, they received a total of only about $3 million, including no more than $2.7 million from the Iran arms sales.    Rep. Aspin's estimate of the size of the diversion is less than previously calculated, but the larger question is how much of their earlier income was spent to build up their arsenal in 1985. It is known that the Nicaraguan Democratic Force, the largest Contra group, received an estimated $32 million from Saudi Arabia, but more than half of it was spent on weapons. </TEXT></DOC>
