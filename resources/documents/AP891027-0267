Their appeal, made at a news conference in Tokyo, marked thelatest round in a battle between the Flight Crew Unions Federationof Japan and Japan's three major airlines over purchases of the newplane.   Japan Air Lines has announced it will buy 20 of the new Boeing747-400s, widely thought to be the next-generation jet plane, andAll Nippon Airways is planning to purchase another 24.   The main advantage of the 747-400 is its fuel-saving features,which allow the plane to fly 930 miles farther than conventional747s.   But the new plane also features an advanced computer system,which, Boeing Co. says, makes it possible to fly the 747-400 withonly two pilots and no flight engineer. The pilots union says theomission of the third person is dangerous.   ``The two-man cockpit design has extensively reduced informationfor ackowledging the condition of the systems and airframe of theaircraft. Also greatly reduced are the tools ... necessary forcoping with a malfunction,'' said Tetsuo Kimura, a flight engineerfor Japan Air Lines.   But Geoffrey Tudor, director of JAL's public relations, said theairline had done everything possible to ensure the plane's safety.   ``We've asked Boeing for certain guarantees that their work isgoing to be ... performing to the best possible standards of safetyas requested by the pilots,'' Tudor said.   He denied that Japan Air Lines' purchase of the new planes waspart of a plan to cut its workforce, said to be one of the highestpaid in the world for an airline. Former flight engineers who losetheir jobs will be sent to a training school to become pilots,Tudor said.   ``No one's going to be laid off. That's not the management'sintention at all,'' he said.   Tetsuya Muranaka, general secretary of the Flight Crew UnionsFederation, denied that union opposition to the new aircraft wasconnected to the potential unemployment of union members.   It ``is not related to the livelihood of the pilots; it is amatter of our lives and the lives of the passengers,'' he said.   Muranaka said the unions' goal was not to prevent the airlinesfrom purchasing the new planes, but to force them to make theplanes safer. He added that the unions might resort to strikes ifnecessary.   After Japan Air Lines released a video last year advertising thenew plane, the Flight Crew Unions Federation spent 3 millionJapanese yen, or around $21,000, to put together its own hour-longresponse.   The federation has since filmed another, shorter video aimed ata general audience. A Japanese press report said Japan Air Lineswas considering filming another video to respond to those made bythe federation.</TEXT></DOC>
