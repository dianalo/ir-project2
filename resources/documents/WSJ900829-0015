There's hardly a peep fromvoices that had insisted since Vietnam that Congress and onlyCongress has the power to risk war. Mr. Bush has reclaimedthe commander-in-chief powers for the presidency.   Indeed, Saddam Hussein's only virtue is that the WarPowers Resolution seems to have been his first victim. This1973 law, viewed as unconstitutional by every presidentsince, says that presidents can send troops into &quot;imminenthostilities&quot; only if Congress declares war, passes a lawallowing the deployment or if there's an attack on U.S.territory or armed forces.</LP><TEXT>   Yet Mr. Bush accomplished a huge call-up while Congresswas out of town. Texas Democrat Henry Gonzalez got no takerslast week when he begged Congress to rush back from recess&quot;to preserve the integrity of its own powers in passing theWar Powers Resolution.&quot; Rep. Gonzalez asked in a letter toHouse Speaker Thomas Foley, &quot;Do we have a president? aCaesar? a monarch? a potentate?&quot; At the risk of givingsomeone any ideas, there's one sure tactic for a congressmanwho wants to save the War Powers Resolution, to wit: Sic anindependent counsel to prosecute Mr. Bush and his aides forviolating it.   You don't have to agree that the constitutional imbalanceof power has recently been at the expense of presidents to beglad that the debate now is about military and not legalstrategy. The overhanging danger in separation-of-powersbattles is that supposed legalities can quickly cloud debateover the substance of policy -- remember Iran-Contra. As timepasses and different risks arise, though, Mr. Bush will haveto decide which tack to take with Congress. He can continueto act alone, he can ask for a declaration of war or he cando something in between.   Mr. Bush knows that if things get messy in the MiddleEast, some congressman is bound to invoke legal constraints.This is why he sent Congress a letter earlier this month &quot;inaccordance with my desire that Congress be fully informed andconsistent with the War Powers Resolution.&quot; This describedthe deployment of forces, noting that &quot;I do not believeinvolvement in hostilities is imminent.&quot;   This is just-in-case boilerplate so that if someone triesto invoke the resolution, Mr. Bush can at least argue thatthe 60-day clock hasn't started ticking yet. This language isimportant because the resolution says that 60 days after&quot;imminent hostilities,&quot; Congress must vote to approve anydeployment or the president must bring the troops home 30days after that.   Washington lawyer Abraham Sofaer knows all about thefetters of excessive legalisms on presidents. He is theformer federal judge who did separation-of-powers hazard dutyas legal adviser in the State Department from 1985 until thispast June. &quot;Those people who say presidents don't have thepower to act have been wrong ever since Alexander Hamiltonand James Madison agreed that President Washington had thepower without Congress to declare neutrality in violation ofa treaty with France, risking war,&quot; he said this week. &quot;Thosepeople are still wrong.&quot;   If he were still in the business of giving legal advice topresidents, Mr. Sofaer said he'd tell Mr. Bush that &quot;it wouldbe a catastrophe if he asked Congress for authority to dowhat he's done. Instead, he needs to say he doesn't need theauthority.&quot; The Founders intended that presidents would actalone. They gave Congress the power formally to &quot;declare&quot;war, but empowered the president when necessary to respond toaggression by making war.   Mr. Bush has a long list of precedents for his actions. Asof 1970, the last time official figures were collected,presidents had sent troops or arms abroad 199 times whereCongress hadn't declared war, which has happened only fivetimes. Congress had consented in only 62 of the incidents, byappropriating specific funds, passing resolutions orratifying treaties that gave the president authority to act.In the remaining 137 instances -- that is, two-thirds of thetime -- presidents acted entirely without authorization byCongress. The ratio would be even higher counting the Reaganpresidency's unilateral actions, such as in Grenada andLibya.   Mr. Sofaer's point about unilateral presidential poweraside, there's a good argument that Mr. Bush should recruitsome kind of formal support from Congress. The Gulf of Tonkinresolution did not stop Congress from tiring of Vietnam. Butwhen Congress shares some accountability, it at least helpskeep the debate on the merits of the policy and away fromwhether the policy is somehow &quot;illegal.&quot;   Law aside, politics will force Mr. Bush to give Congress aclearer explanation of his intentions. Does he want Saddamonly out of Kuwait or also out of Iraq? Will he be satisfiedif Iraq retains chemical weapons? Does he think the fate ofour hostages could justify military action?   &quot;We want either Perdicaris alive or Raisuli dead,&quot; TeddyRoosevelt announced in 1904 when he sent warships to Moroccoto force a bandit chieftain to release a kidnappedGreek-American, Ion Perdicaris. Mr. Bush has not yet said,&quot;We want either Ambassador Nathaniel Howell alive or Saddamdead.&quot; If he does, he can cite the little-known Hostage Actof 1868, by which Congress actually required the president touse force if necessary to free Americans held by foreigngovernments.   Building a political consensus with Congress is only partof the battle. Mr. Sofaer also worries about internationallaw, especially now that the United Nations has gotten soinvolved. &quot;The test is not, are we going to convince the U.N.finally to do the right thing,&quot; Mr. Sofaer said. &quot;The testis, are we going to win?&quot;   He noted that the U.N. Charter allows countries to usecollective self-defense, which &quot;gives us plenty of legalauthority to do what we want to restore the sovereignty ofKuwait.&quot; But there is a problem. The charter seems only toallow collective self-defense until the U.N. itself takesaction. The U.N. has now passed a resolution, though only toallow possibly weak implementation of a blockade of Iraq.   &quot;The resolution subjects military actions to the review ofthe Security Council, almost as though we had to check withthe U.N. before using force,&quot; Mr. Sofaer said. &quot;Byimplication, the U.N. has adopted the means that we cannot gobeyond. We must say, no, we will use necessary andproportionate force.&quot; Unlike Congress, there's little theU.N. can do to stop Mr. Bush.   As always, a president has more to worry about than aSaddam Hussein. A report on the American system was neatlysummed up in a recent London Daily Telegraph headline, &quot;BushStands Tall -- But for How Long?&quot; above a report warning that&quot;Congress has two months before it will vote on extending thepresident's war powers.&quot; Now that Mr. Bush has managed tounite the world against Saddam, he might even be up to thetask of getting and keeping Congress on board.</TEXT></DOC>
