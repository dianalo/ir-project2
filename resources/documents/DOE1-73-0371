The use of nuclear energy is ethicallyjustifiable, provided that several fundamental rules are obeyed duringthe technical design of nuclear installations. Such fundamental ruleswere unequivocally violated in the nuclear power plant Chernobyl. Theyare, however, fulfilled in the existing Swiss nuclear power plants. Improvementsare possible in new nuclear power plants. Compared to other usable energysystems nuclear energy is second only to natural gas in minimal riskper generated energy unit. The question of ethical justification alsomay rightly be asked of the non-use of nuclear energy. The socially weakestmembers of the Swiss population would suffer most under a renunciationof nuclear energy. Future prospects for the developing countries woulddeteriorate considerably with a renunciation by industrial nations ofnuclear energy. The widely spread fear concerning the nuclear energyin the population is a consequence of non-objective discussion. 8 refs.,2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
