Keller   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>06/05/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE B4</SO><CO>   T INTC TDM NOVL</CO><IN>COMPUTERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (CPR)</IN><LP>   American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s computer unitunveiled two dozen products, including powerful Unixsoftware-based servers, personal computers and upgrades toits existing products.   Chief among the new products are so-called server systems,which coordinate the flow of data and storage of informationon a network of personal computers. One, called theStarServer E, uses the i486 microprocessor made by IntelCorp. The other server is a fault-tolerant machine designedby Cupertino, Calif.-based Tandem Computers Inc. and NewYork-based ATandamp;T and is built by Tandem.</LP><TEXT>   The StarServer E, which ATandamp;T will begin shipping nextmonth, is designed to use between one and four computerprocessors. System performance starts at 25 millioninstructions per second with one processor and increases by25% each time a new processor is added for a total 106 MIPS,according to ATandamp;T. The system's i486 chip runs one-thirdfaster than other i486 chips now in use.   &quot;No other machine in the market has that kind ofperformance,&quot; said Richard A. McGuinn, president of ATandamp;TComputer Systems. &quot;It's hot.&quot; However, competitors such asCompaq Computer Corp., Houston, and netFRAME Systems Inc.,Milpitas, Calif., offer competing servers using Intel's 486.But neither use the Unix software operating system designedby ATandamp;T.   &quot;The Unix market is a little overcrowded right now,&quot; saidEnzo Torresi, netFRAME's president. &quot;We're taking a differentapproach, using Netware software, but by first quarter of1991 we'll introduce a Unix-based system.&quot; Netware is acompeting software made by Novell Inc., Provo, Utah.   The fault-tolerant machine, which ATandamp;T said is availablefor shipments now, is designed for telecommunications andother applications such as financial transaction servicesthat cannot afford a computer system failure. The Tandemmachine will diagnose itself when it has a problem,automatically call a service center and the center will sendout a replacement part, which Mr. McGuinn said can be snappedinto place by &quot;even a clerk.&quot;   ATandamp;T made its product announcement at the COMDEX/Spring'90 computer show in Atlanta. It said it would build theStarServer E at its Little Rock, Ark., plant, which recentlybegan volume production of the personal computer that ATandamp;Tdesigned with Intel.   ATandamp;T also unveiled new versions of its 6386 personalcomputer and upgrades for its 3B2 line of minicomputers. One6386 model can be upgraded to an i486-based system withouthaving to buy a new PC. Another unit, called the 6386SX, canbe bought without a disk and is used in large networkscontrolled by server systems. The 3B2 upgrades includeenhanced Unix software and improved data-networkingfunctions.   Rikki Kirzner, senior industry analyst at marketresearcher Dataquest Inc., said ATandamp;T's new products &quot;bythemselves are OK. They're nice middle-of-the-roadcompetitive products.&quot; What's impressive, she said, is howthey fit well with ATandamp;T's strategy to be a systemsintegrator.   &quot;ATandamp;T wants to be the womb-to-tomb supplier in computersystems just like they are in phone systems,&quot; she said. Ifyou look at the company's products and partnerships over thelast year, you're starting to see a very strong set of{products} emerging.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
