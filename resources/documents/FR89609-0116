In the future this Board will consist of theparalegals and supervisory paralegals employed in the Office of Proceedings'Motor Section. Determination of matters within the Board's jurisdictionwill be based on the votes of one paralegal and one supervisory paralegal.In the event of a tie vote, the vote of a second supervisory paralegalwill be secured to break the tie.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE: </T2>June 9, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>Richard B. Felder, (202) 275-7691.[TDD for hearing impaired: (202) 275-1721].</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2>Under 49 CFR 1011.6(i), the Commissionhas delegated to an employee board the less substantive matters involvingpre-publication of motor carrier licensing applications, small carriertransfer applications, temporary authority applications related to financeproceedings, applications for certificates of registration by foreign motorcarriers and foreign motor private carriers, and applications that havenot involved taking testimony at a public hearing or the submission ofevidence by opposing parties in the form of affidavits, relating to: (a)The transfer of property brokers' licenses and changes in control of brokers,and (b) the transfer of Certificates of Registration and rights to operatepending determination of applications for Certificates of Registration.The Board has consisted of 3 members chosen on a rotating basis from a12-member pool of attorneys approved annually by the Commission (<T3>see</T3> 49 FR 31070, August 3, 1984).By this notice, the Commission is exercising its authority under 49 U.S.C.10304 and 10305 to abolish the 12-attorney pool and rotating 3-member boards,and is replacing them with a permanent board comprised of all of the paralegalsand supervisory paralegals employed in the Office of Procedings' MotorSection. Determination of matters within the Board's jurisdiction willbe based on the votes of one paralegal and one supervisory paralegal fromthe permanent Board. In cases where a paralegal and a supervisory paralegaldo not agree, the vote of a second supervisory paralegal will break thetie.Our decision to change the composition of the employee board acknowledgesthat the work of the Board is predominantly routine in nature. In the nearly5 years since the Board was created, the paralegals and supervisory paralegalshave assisted the Board in performing its function and have demonstratedtheir thorough understanding of the matters within the Board's jurisdiction.A more efficient use of personnel will result from this change in the compositionof the Board.Because the members of the Motor Carrier Board rotated approximately every3 months, the membership was periodically announced in the <T3>ICC Register</T3>. Our decision to replace the 3-attorney rotatingboard with a permanent board comprised of Motor Section paralegals andsupervisory paralegals eliminates the need for future announcements ofBoard membership.Since this change in Motor Carrier Baord membership affects internal Commissionprocedures only, it is issued in 49 CFR Part 1011.6(i) final form and publiccomment is not required. <T3>See</T3> 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(A).This section doeds not affect significantly the quality of the human environmentor the conservation of energy resources.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>5 U.S.C. 553 and 49 U.S.C. 10304-10305.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Decided: May 26, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">By the Commission, Chairman Gradison, Vice Chairman Simmons, CommissionersAndre, Lamboley, and Phillips.
