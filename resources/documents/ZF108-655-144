(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>LITERALLY HUNDREDS of newspapers are using Quark Xpress, Multi-Ad Creator,PageMaker, Illustrator and many other desktop packages to produce a portionof their pages.andP;  Some of the largest newspapers and magazines in thecountry-arnong them the San Francisco Examiner, the Dallas Morning News andTime Inc.'s new Entertainment Weekly-are in this group.andP;  But in most cases,the packages are being used as supplemental software, doing only parts of thepaper-usually the non-deadline advance sections like the Sunday magazine orLife Style feature pages.andP;  We wondered if a newspaper (and not just a smallweekly or a 16-page daily) could rely on desktop technology for theproduction of its entire paper.andM;We thought LeDroit, the French language paper for Canada's National CapitalRegion, would be a good candidate, but we didn't realize at first how idealit really was for what we were trying to accomplish.andP;  It is a 64-page tabloidwith lots of graphics and a fair amount of color.andP;  The newspaper is publishedsix days a week (no Sunday edition), with its Saturday edition running about120 pages.andP;  To make things a bit more difficult for the vendors, the paper isentirely in French.andM;LeDroit couldn't afford to tiptoe into the new technology.andP;  For a number ofreasons, it had to make a full commitment once it started.andM;The challenge.andP;  LeDroit was facing a very difficult time in the fall of 1989.andO;Its composing room contract was due to expire at the end of the year.andO;Financially, it could afford neither its high production costs nor its olderAtex system.andP;  It had to find a way to build a complete system for areasonable cost, one that could produce the entire paper without anyproduction department.andP;  If there was a solution, it would be all or nothing.andO;To further complicate the situation, the printing of the paper was farmed outto a remote printing location.andM;In other words, the entire paper had to be completely assembledelectronically: text, ads and graphics (including color).andP;  It had to be in aform that could be transmitted electronically to a remote site where it couldbe typeset directly to film.andP;  Pasteup would only be allowed for somecamera-ready ads: those with prescreened halftones or taking the full page.andM;Adding to the technical challenges, the paper had to accomplish its task in abrand-new building and it had to complete the project within three months-bythe last day of the union contract, December 31, 1989.andM;But most of all, this was no experiment.andP;  On December 31, the system had towork.andP;  There was no room for it to &quot;almost&quot; work.andP;  It was &quot;do or die.&quot; Butfrom this challenge-this absolute need to succeed-a good system and a newmethodology for system implementation evolved.andM;The players.andP;  LeDroit deserves a lot of credit for making a bold decision toemploy a system integrator rather than a traditional vendor to build its newsystem.andP;  Although this may not be the best decision for everyone, it hasturned out well for this paper.andM;LeDroit had previous experience with a traditional vendor and with atraditional system that got the paper out.andP;  But the system was very costly tomaintain and manage-something LeDroit could no longer afford.andP;  Moreover, anychanges to the system were time-consuming, major undertakings.andP;  It alsowasn't possible to use many of the new software tools that might help theoperation.andP;  For these reasons, LeDroit decided to start with an independentsystem integrator-an organization that would provide it with an open systemthat could (1) get the product out the door without a production department,and (2) be added to and modified without the extraordinary cost associatedwith traditional systems.andP;  Its choice was Systemhouse Inc. of Canada.andM;Systemhouse represents one of the best examples we have found of a completelyindependent system integrator.andP;  (Another, by the way, is CNI, a newly formedNew England company.) Its primary task is integrating other vendors'products, developing only the software glue that lets them work together.andO;Systemhouse views itself as a &quot;full-service computer and communicationssystem integrator, delivering complex systems and microcomputer integrationproducts and services to meet the specific needs of business and governmentorganizations in Canada, the U.S.andP;  and internationally.&quot;andM;Notice that it doesn't bill itself as a publishing vendor.andP;  In fact, LeDroitis the first publishing project it has tackled.andP;  But system integration isnot a strange topic to Systemhouse.andP;  It has been building large and smallsystems for several other markets and application areas since 1974.andP;  Its 1989revenues exceeded $650 million (Canadian).andP;  In acquisitions related to thepublishing field, in 1988 it acquired Computerland Canada and in 1989 itbought 14 of the 24 Computerland locations in the UK.andM;Still, we were surprised at the depth of understanding this group exhibitedin building its first newspaper system.andP;  It was very thorough, taking theproject from beginning to end.andM;Services of a system integratorandM;Every system integrator has its own concept of what it provides.andP;  (What itdoesn't provide is sometimes even more important.) Systemhouse offers onemodel of what to look for when searching for a good system integrator.andP;  Itviews system integration as a fife cycle of nine potential steps.andP;  (Itemswith an asterisk instead of a bullet indicate those that were performed bySystemhouse for LeDroit.)andM;* System planning-strategic, long- and short-range planning.andM;* Project initiation-scoping the project.andM;* Defining the architecture of the system.andM;* Analysis of application requirements and prototyping.andM;* Design-application specification and user aids.andM;* Development-build and test the system and all of its links.andM;* Facilities engineering-site planning and physical installation of hardware.andM;* Implementation-integration and acceptance testing.andM;* Post-implementation-support, maintenance and performance monitoring.andM;Systemhouse's role can be summarized as handling three major steps:andM;1.andP;  It planned the system after understanding what hadandM;to be accomplished-a step often performed by anandM;outside consultant.andM;2.andP;  It built and installed the system, tying all the hardwareandM;and software components together.andM;3.andP;  It tested the system and continues to maintain it atandM;optimum performance levels.andM;SCS.andP;  Another player in this installation is Software Consulting Services,Inc. Although the customer clearly wanted an independent system integrator toplan, assemble and maintain its system, it wasn't averse to subsystems andcomponents from traditional vendors-as long as the overall system wasn'tcompletely dependent on that vendor.andM;SCS was chosen to provide several key elements, including front-end editorialand classified software, Layout-8000 and extensions to Quark Xpress.andM;Other software.andP;  In addition to the software provided by SCS, LeDroit isusing Multi-Ad Services' Creator, SuperMac's PixelPaint Professional andAdobe's Streamline for display ad work and graphics creation.andP;  AdobeIllustrator is used for aH text rotation needed for news copy  currently areal limitation of Quark).andP;  Altsys's Fontographer is used for the creation oflogos and icons.andP;  Pre-Press Technologies' Spectre Print, Letraset'sImageStudio (for monochrome images) and Silicon Beach's Superpaint are usedin its photo and retouching work.andP;  Quark Xpress is used extensively foreditorial page makeup and color separations.andP;  Pongrass's classified pagemakeup software now complements Quark Xpress for classified pagination.andM;The systemandM;Systemhouse began by designing the infrastructure: two Ethernet local areanetworks and a landline bridge to a third Ethernet at the remote printingplant, all running TCP/IP protocol (see diagram).andP;  One Ethernet is used toconnect most of the PC hardware, which includes file servers for theeditorial and classified systems, a backup system, and a PC dedicated torunning Layout-8000 for ad dummying.andP;  A second Ethernet LAN, bridged to thefirst, connects all the Macs used for pagination, image scanning and adcomposition.andP;  At the remote site, a file server and a Mac are connected to apair of Linotype Linotronic 300 imagesetters.andM;Editorial.andP;  The editorial system, provided by SCS, is based on dual '386 PCfile servers running Xenix.andP;  Attached to the servers are 28 non-intelligentterminals used for writer and reporter entry as well as early copy editing.andM;The editorial system also provides for remote reporter entry and news wires.andO;LeDroit uses the Canadian CP English news wire, the CP French language wireand the CP stocks.andP;  Although this system contains such bells and whistles asa spelling checker and composition, at LeDroit it is being used as a`no-frills' text capturing system that has been tuned to mimic the previousAtex system.andP;  Its editing functionality is similar enough that writers andeditors have perceived the change to SCS as `transparent.' However, it is notbeing used as a full editorial system; it only outputs raw copy (onedirection) to the pagination system.andP;  The composition and typesettingcapabilities of the system arc not used at all.andP;  Thus, it is servingessentially as a word processor with a common file server.andM;In several discussions with the newspaper staff, it was evident that sincethe system is being used more as a word processor than as a full-blowneditorial system, at a future date it easily could be replaced by a networkof PCs.andP;  In fact, the editorial staff is already asking for additionalfeatures (eg., a thesaurus) that are common in PC word processor packages.andM;Classified.andP;  The classified system is also a standard SCS product, built onthe same hardware: a '386 PC as a file server with eight non-intelligentterminals for ad order and entry.andM;Layout-8000.andP;  Another  386 PC handles SCS's specialty, Layout-8000.andP;  The PCreceives ad orders directly, online from the paper's IBM business system,where all ad orders are initially entered.andP;  The output of Layout-8000 is inelectronic form, ready to be imported directly into Quark Xpress.andM;A third '386 PC is used as backup for the other servers.andM;Display ad makeup.andP;  Six Macintoshes are dedicated for display ad work,running a variety of programs for ad building because LeDroit has found thateach program is best suited to a different type of ad.andP;  The majority of adsare built in Multi-Ad Creator.andP;  This program uses the PICT format to outputads that win be placed on pages by Quark Xpress.andP;  (SCS has aPostScript-to-EPS conversion program to facilitate further the placement ofMulti-Ad ads onto Quark pages.andP;  This feature hasn't been implemented atLeDroit yet, but it is being used at other SCS sites.) Ads with photos orcolor are often built using Quark Xpress and saved for pagination in Quark'snative format.andP;  Several graphics programs are used in ad building also,including Aldus FreeHand and Adobe illustrator.andM;It is left to the operator and the supervisor to choose the most appropriateset of software for each task.andP;  The real key, as we will discuss later, isthe tracking and copy flow of the ads and their respective components.andP;  Thisis critical-much more important than the programs that are used to build theads.andM;Scanning.andP;  Two Mac-based image scanning stations are connected to the system,each with its own 200-MB disk.andP;  These are used for scanning all contones,line art and color photos for the entire paper (ads or news).andP;  Operatingthese scanning terminals are individuals who have been trained, not only inhow the scanning and image manipulation programs work, but in what must bedone to images to make them print well, not just look good on monitors.andM;Attached to the scanning terminals are a variety of scanners, including Nikonslide scanners, Xerox flatbed scanners and Howtek color scanners.andP;  Softwareused in conjunction with these devices includes Pre-Press Technologies'Spectre Print, Adobe's Photoshop, Letraset's ImageStudio and Silicon Beach'sSuperpaint.andM;Pagination.andP;  The final parts of the newspaper's configuration are thepagination terminals.andP;  A total of seven Macintosh Ilci computers (three ofthem with color displays) are used with Quark Xpress to build all theeditorial pages.andP;  These terminals interact with a Mac Il file server thatcontains all the pages before they are sent to the remote printing operation.andM;Print site.andP;  The pagination LAN is bridged to the print site via two 56K-baudlines.andP;  These are used in parallel to transmit all PostScript pages toanother Mac file server at the remote site, which is used to monitor the L300typesetters.andP;  It also can be used to drive the typesetters, should the needarise (in the event of a failed communications line).andP;  Before LeDroit startedtypesetting directly from the newspaper site (across the communication finkin real time), the remote Mac file server was used to buffer pages beforethey were set (on the two L300 typesetters.andM;Copy flow for news pagesandM;Systemhouse has set up a network-wide queue/folder structure to implement thecopy flow it established for the paper.andP;  For the most part, the structure ofthe queues, combined with the copy-flow procedures, helps to avoid some ofthe inherent system limitations often found with desktop software packages.andO;(See story on page 13.)andM;Like most other newspaper systems, the Systemhouse design provides parallelpaths for the major components of the newspaper.andP;  Separate operations (andtherefore copy flows) are in place for editorial matter, classified ads,display ads and graphics.andP;  Graphics are treated as a separate function,regardless of whether scanned images will be incorporated within ads ordirectly within news pages.andP;  Ad layout (dummying) and pagination can also beviewed as flowing separately because they are somewhat independent and canwork in parallel with some of these operations.andM;Editorial.andP;  The three major steps to the editorial process at LeDroit are (1)writing, (2) editing, and (3) page makeup and final copy fitting.andP;  Theprocess begins when local reporters write their stories on terminalsconnected to the SCS  386 file servers.andP;  There they have a queue and groupstructure similar to their previous Atex system, complete with individualuser queues and department queues or groups for sports, national news and soon.andM;Wire service stories and remote copy are also captured and sorted on thesefile servers (dual  386 units that back up each other's databases) and routedto their appropriate queues or groups.andP;  Stories that go through initialediting stages are moved from individual user queues to department queues.andO;Designated editorial staff members are responsible for daily housekeeping ofthese queues to keep them from getting too cluttered with old stories.andM;The SCS system is being used purely for raw text input.andP;  Although a header isattached to each story (and is useful during the initial editing and routingstages), it is stripped when it is transferred to the Macintosh paginationsystem.andP;  Currently, even simple markup such as italicizing and emboldening ofwords is not done at the front end.andP;  This is not a question of compatibilitybetween SCS and Quark; it is part of the philosophy of the paper.andP;  In fact,since SCS has written a composition output module to drive Quark directly (asif it were a typesetter), the SCS system could be used for much more of thecomposition process.andP;  This would be particularly applicable to the lessdesign-oriented pages.andM;LeDroit strongly believes, however, that desk editors are the best personneland page makeup is the best location for all formatting and styling to beapplied to text.andP;  In time, this may change for simple coding such asitalicizing words.andP;  But LeDroit points out that these decisions are also tiedto the type of person it hires to do different tasks.andP;  The paper feels thatits personnel, the equipment in use, the copy flow and job assignmentscurrently are all in sync.andM;Edition design, layout, page makeup.andP;  While stories are being written and adsare being built, edition design takes place.andP;  Once all the ad orders for aparticular edition have been entered in LeDroit's IBM business system, itsends an electronic file to the Layout-8000 PC.andP;  Here an operator dummies theedition with the aid of the Layout-8000 program, placing all the POP ads atspecific locations on new pages.andP;  (A similar task is done for classifiedads.) In addition to placing ads onto pages, the program also generates pagegeometries in Quark format (with slug information for automatic foliogeneration) for each page in the edition.andP;  Once completed, these page filesarc sent to the Mac pagination system, where they become ready for editoriallayout and design.andM;This is an important piece of software developed by SCS.andP;  There are twoimportant benefits of this process of creating &quot;Quark page formats.&quot; First,it allows the editors simply to call up pregenerated page geometries (Quarktemplates) for each edition.andP;  Pages will have standing matter, page numbersand space reservations for display ads already in place when the page iscalled to the screen.andP;  Second, the program also establishes the links to the&quot;real&quot; display ads that will eventually be typeset in place of theirrespective space reservations.andP;  When the completed news pages are sent to thetypesetter, the links puB in the real (live) ads from their database and sendthem along with all of the other page elements (text, photos, graphics, etc.)andO;to the typesetter(s) or proofing device(s).andM;Here is where the system integrator earns his keep.andP;  A considerable amount ofcoordination between Systemhouse and SCS was necessary to make this processas automated as possible.andP;  As page elements are assembled for output, all ofthe appropriate files (especially those created on other systems) have to belinked as one output stream.andP;  Keeping track of copy, establishing what goesinto which folder and how copy or page elements are moved between folders canmake a significant difference in the degree of automation in and theperformance of the overall system.andM;Data gathering.andP;  Desk editors, called &quot;deskers&quot; at LeDroit, are responsiblefor gathering all the stories (and other page elements) into page folders onthe Mac.andP;  They do this with the help of another program developed by SCS,called Term-8000.andP;  On a Mac workstation (which will be used next to buildcompleted pages with Quark Xpress), each desker can access the SCS editorialsystem with the same logon and security features offered to the writerterminals.andP;  (SCS also offers this emulation program on PCs.) The desker canbrowse through the directory structure of the editorial system to view andselect all the stories he will eventually place onto pages and copy fitduring the pagination stage.andP;  In fact, from the Mac, he can perform all thebasic functions that the editors on the SCS system can.andP;  However, inpractice, this link is used solely to select stories for the edition.andM;Using the paper ad dummies that were printed as a result of runningLayout-8000, a supervisor assigns pages to a group of deskers.andP;  In somecases, stories have been preassigned to pages by the chief, but in mostcases, this is the job of each individual desker.andP;  Using the SCS emulationprogram, he selects stories from the editorial system and pulls them intoequivalent department folders on his Mac file server.andP;  Technically, the SCSsystem sends the selected stories to the Mac file servers.) There is aone-for-one mapping of SCS directories to Mac file folders to simplify andautomate this transfer and keep it orderly-another task requiring thecooperation of SCS and the system integrator.andM;As stories are sent from SCS into the Mac AppleShare filing system, theirformat is slightly changed in order to be completely compatible with QuarkXpress, which will compose all text during pagination.andP;  This is done as abackground task in the Mac.andP;  In Apple's terminology, files are changed froman &quot;unknown creator&quot; status to  Quark Layout 8000&quot; as the creator, whichallows SCS's Quark Xtension program to access the files.andP;  As part of thisprocess, the content of each story is filtered to make sure that eachcharacter entered on the SCS system is mapped to an equivalent character inthe Quark format.andP;  The SCS file headers are also deleted.andM;Photos.andP;  During the early stages of page design and layout, a desker is alsoresponsible for the selection of photos and graphics he will use on hispages.andP;  Currently, all wire photos are selected from hard-copy laser output.andO;A new Mac-based electronic picture desk (from Anaya of Spain) is plannedshortly to automate wire picture capture further.andP;  But for now, wire photos(as well as local pictures) are selected and specified using a simple form tospecify cropping, sizing and naming of all photos.andM;The photos are scanned (and edited if necessary) by three experts at the twoscanning stations.andP;  Their mission is to massage the images so they will printoptimally, taking into account the page makeup software, typesetter and presscharacteristics.andP;  They have a variety of tools, including flatbed, slide andcolor scanners, and several different programs for image manipulation.andO;(Still-video photography is the next piece to be added; LeDroit has ordered aCanon camera for evaluation.) Scanned news photos arc stored initially on thepagination file server in a &quot;raw scans&quot; folder under the name assigned by thedesker.andP;  Photos or graphics associated with ads are sent to a separatead-graphics file server.andM;Final preparation before makeup.andP;  Once stories begin entering the Mac fileservers and photos are scanned, the desker begins the process of designingand building pages.andP;  This starts with the selection of a basic page templatethat sets up overall parameters for the page and already includes standingtext and graphic items.andP;  Different templates are stored for differentsections and vary slightly for left and right pages.andP;  Software forautomatically attaching Layout-8000 page dummies to page templates iscurrently under development.andM;After calling the appropriate template to the screen and saving it under aname that reflects the edition and page number, the desker manually links itto pages created by Layout-8000, which in turn have their own links todisplay ads.andP;  This is done with another set of Xtensions to Quark Xpress,written by SCS, called &quot;SCS-Linx.&quot;andM;All of these files are established on the desker's own hard drive-not thecentral file server-providing a built-in degree of backup at the file level.andO;In fact, all the elements (stories and low-resolution versions of photos) tobe used on a desker's assigned pages are copied to that user's hard drive,where they will be worked on until the pages are complete.andP;  This not onlygives LeDroit another level of backup, but it also simplifies the linkingtask for Quark, allowing all parts of a page (except the display ads) to staytogether as part of the page.andP;  This is particularly useful in that when Quarkpage files are moved around a network, they don't always remember their linksto other components of a page, notably large TFF files.andP;  (Quark's links arepath names specifying the locations-somewhere within the filing system-ofother elements on the page.) Keeping all the components of a Quark pagetogether (and minimizing the movement of Quark pages around a network) helpsto alleviate this problem.andM;Page makeup.andP;  Page makeup can begin after page templates have been linked toad placement data from Layout-8000 and after all the files to be placed ontopages are copied to a desker's own hard disk.andP;  Using Quark Xpress, the deskerflows each story onto the page, applies predefined text styles, and edits thecopy as necessary to fit the space assigned to it.andP;  (Incidentally, LeDroitemployed a professional designer to help establish the look of the paper,taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the programs-mainlyXpress-it planned to use.)andM;Low-resolution versions of photos (which are linked to the high-resolutionversions stored on the graphic file servers) are placed the same way-croppedor sized to adjust for minor differences from the original size as scanned.andO;The desker also writes all the headlines and photo captions.andP;  This is clearlya &quot;one editor per page&quot; philosophy, where the editor is responsible foreverything on that page.andP;  This philosophy could result in problems if LeDroithad to contend frequently with jumping stories from one page to another, butit doesn't.andP;  In the rare instances in which it does continue a story on alater page, it splits the story into two pieces-one for each page.andP;  Thismakes editing of the story precarious because the two pieces no longer flowcontiguously, but it doesn't happen often.andM;In spite of the potential problem with jumping stories, theone-editor-per-page philosophy works well because the software and the copyflow exactly match the philosophy of LeDroit.andP;  The desker is the sole personin charge of page design, style and final editing, including headlines.andP;  Innewspapers where these functions are distributed among several editors(possibly on several systems), the correlation of data (outlines to photos,headlines to stories) and matching of sizes and styles (headlines written byperson  A&quot; must fit the layout designed by person  B&quot;) are critical and notsomething you automatically get from Quark or any other desktop product.andP;  Wedon't mean to imply that these are beyond the capabilities of these softwareproducts, but they must be run on a properly configured system.andP;  The key thatseparates the systems that work well from those that simply use &quot;brute force&quot;to complete the pagination task is the  glue&quot; provided by a good systemintegrator.andM;Since copy editing and copy fitting are done as part of the paginationprocess in Quark, LeDroit doesn't use the handamp;j or composition features of theSCS system even for establishing approximate depths.andP;  It relies on itsreporters and editors to write stories to &quot;appropriate&quot; length by experienceand simple line counts.andP;  The deskers adjust the layout or edit the story toreconcile any differences between the amount of copy and the size of the newshole.andM;This raises another important point.andP;  Quark does not pass geometry (the sizeand shape of a news bole) back to the editorial system, so it is not wellsuited to papers where the writers must fit copy to exact length on theirfront-end editorial systems.andP;  However, LeDroit's reporters and editors arenot called on to do this.andM;We asked LeDroit whether its copy-flow scheme created bottlenecks and whetherit had changed its copy flow since abandoning its Atex system.andP;  The answerwas no on both counts.andP;  It hasn't seen bottlenecks due to one editor buildingthe entire page.andP;  (This is often referred to as a &quot;back-end&quot; paginationscenario.) It gets around bottlenecks by working on parts of several pages asstories become available.andP;  In fact, if a late-breaking story arrives,inserting it directly on a page and making some changes to accommodate it ismuch faster than with the previous front-end approach.andP;  As for changes incopy flow, the current method of page makeup is the same approach LeDroitpreviously used with its Atex system-one editor per page.andP;  Some things areeven better: using the new system, an editor doesn't need two screens on hisdesk (one for layout and one for editing) as he did before.andP;  Some things areworse, such as the problem with continuation stories that we described above.andM;Output preparation.andP;  When pages are complete, the desker proofs them on thescreen.andP;  Corrections (if any) are done by the same desker.andP;  Finished pagesare copied to a Finisbed Pages folder for that edition on the pagination fileserver.andP;  This creates another level of backup at the page level.andM;A final review of this server copy is done by a supervisor.andP;  As we mentionedbefore, Quark pages copied from one disk to another-especially thosecontaining large TIFF files-often lose the links to the photos.andP;  So at thisstage, any links that are lost during the copying stage are reestablishedbefore the page is ready for final output to the remote printing plant.andO;Quark 3.0 will supposedly offer a more flexible link technology that LeDroithopes willf eliminate this problem.andM;Ad links.andP;  How do ads get onto pages? During the page building stage, thereservation for each ad is established automatically with the SCS-LinxXtension-but this only reserves space for the actual ad, which is being builtin a parallel process.andP;  As ads are completed for this edition, they arerouted (copied) from the ads/graphics file servers to the edition's &quot;finished ads&quot; folder on the pagination server.andP;  Running SCS-Linx hereautomatically links the final, made-up version of each ad with its locationon the page.andP;  Any camera-ready ads that were not scanned into the systembecause of size or graphic content) are sent by courier to the printingplant.andM;Just because ads were built, proofed and routed to the correct folder doesn'tmean they arc fully compatible with the format of the news pages.andP;  LeDroit(like many other papers we have visited) is using several different softwarepackages for ad makeup.andP;  Different formats from each (mostly EPS and PICT)are required to combine those ads properly within the constraints of the pagemakeup software (in this case Quark Xpress).andP;  Someone has to take charge ofthis problem.andP;  The system architecture that Systemhouse designed provides forthis.andM;Many larger papers ask for the status of display ads at deadline so they knowwhether pages are completely ready for output.andP;  This is not a problem atLeDroit.andP;  There are several ways of checking.andP;  A supervisor can simply lookinto the Finished Ads folder for that edition.andP;  If an ad is there, it is doneand ready for automatic placement onto a page.andP;  A proof, on the screen orfrom a laser printer, also shows the final status of a page (and whether ornot the ads fit reserved spaces).andP;  But Systemhouse has taken this one stepfurther.andP;  It has developed a program to read the SCS Edition Ad File andcross-reference it with the Finished Ads folder to produce an exceptionreport.andP;  This program can be run at any time to provide the supervisor withan overview of the ad schedule and what ads are ready or not ready for anyedition.andM;Clearly, a well-integrated system designed by a system vendor could go beyondwhat we have described here.andP;  Nor do we think Quark (or any other desktopprogram) is by any means perfect for large, high-end applications.andP;  ButLeDroit is an excellent example of how many of the inherent limitations of asingle-user program can be significantly reduced or elimininated.andM;What it takes is the help of a good system integrator and a willingness toalter the paper's copy flow to reflect the differences betweeneditorial/electronic pagination and composing room pasteup-the two are verydifferent.andP;  Those newspapers that try to duplicate manual pasteup and itsassociated copy flow with electronic pagination may be missing an opportunityto take full advantage of what the new technology has to offer.andM;Final output.andP;  Until recently, when the supervisor was satisfied that a pagewas ready for output, he would first create a PostScript output file of thatpage.andP;  Then a clerical person would be assigned to send the page to theremote printing plant over two 56K-baud lines, copying it from the paginationfile server to a file server at the print site.andP;  There, because AppleSharedoesn't provide for concurrent &quot;downloading,&quot; a secondary copy would bepassed to another Mac.andP;  From the second Mac, an operator would download thepage file to the typesetters over a LocalTalk connection.andP;  Since all pageswere 100% complete with text, ads and graphics, they were all set directly onfilm, saving valuable time at the platemaking stage.andP;  Only camera-ready adswere stripped in as negatives.andM;This procedure-creating the PostScript files at the newspaper, buffering themon a file server at the remote site, and downloading them to thetypesetters-was an acceptable process.andP;  But it offered only marginal outputperformance levels.andM;An alternative procedure was recently devised and is now in full operation.andO;The supervisor simply &quot;prints&quot; the files directly to the typesetters from thepagination program via the 56K-baud lines.andP;  PostScript files are no longerbeing buffered within the remote file server and downloaded from there.andO;LeDroit says that the new procedure is saving at least 75% of the outputtime.andP;  Apparently the downloader program was dreadfully inefficient, andtypesetting direct (creating the PostScript files on the fly) avoids thisbottleneck.andM;Another oddity that emerged had to do with the output path to the L300.andP;  WhenLeDroit downloaded PostScript files to the L300s, it found (to its surprise)that the LocalTalk link was twice as fast as the Ethernet connection.andO;Linotype had no good explanations-but again, the downloader program is beingblamed.andP;  Now that LeDroit is printing directly from the newspaper site, theEthernet link is two to three times faster than LocalTalk, as one wouldexpect.andM;Printing directly, LeDroit is typesetting average (tabloid) pages, completewith halftones, ads and text, in about three minutes per page.andP;  This speed isquite good when compared to other publishers outputting on L300s with AtlasRJPs.andP;  Part of the reason is the lower output resolution LeDroit is using formonochrome pages: 635 dpi.andP;  Color pages are output at 1,270 dpi.andP;  To getacceptable photos at the 635-dpi resolution, LeDroit has trained itsphotographers to shoot printable pictures; its scanner operators alsocompensate during image manipulation.andM;Classified copy flowandM;Until recently, classified pagination followed the same copy flow andprocedures as editorial matter.andP;  The SCS system was used to take allclassified ads (orders and text).andP;  It would route the billing information tothe IBM business system and, eventually, the text to the Mac system (graphicfile servers), where it would be electronically pasted into place bypersonnel in the graphics/ads department using Quark Xpress.andP;  It also usedLayout-8000 for the automatic placement (ad dummying) of classified displayads, and within Xpress treated the classified liners as news body text,electronically pasting it into galleys.andP;  The same SCS-Linx software thatattaches ROP display ads to Layout-8000 reservations on Xpress was used forclassified pages as well.andP;  The makeup and copy flow of classified display adswas identical to ROP display.andM;This approach to classified pagination has recently changed.andP;  LeDroit is justgoing five with a new software product from Pongrass of Australia.andP;  Pongrassis a member of Digital Technology's cooperative marketing and developmentteam and is also now linked to SCS.andP;  At LeDroit, the Pongrass software worksin conjunction with the Quark software as the primary method of paginatingthe classified section.andP;  Since this new product is about to make an impact onsmaller and medium-size papers worldwide, we plan to write a separate reviewof its merits and functionality.andM;Display ads and copy flowandM;We decided to take a quick look at display ad makeup because it tends toexpose multiuser system problems associated with off-the-shelf desktopsoftware.andP;  Most observers agree that several packages running on PCs and Macshave features and functionality that rival (and sometimes exceed) thehigh-priced spreads.andP;  But where they often run into trouble is in multiuseraccess-the same problems that affect the page makeup packages.andM;These problems are usually magnified when users try to incorporate graphics.andO;Without a database to correlate all the pieces of display ads, simply havingthe ability to manipulate graphics and photos as parts of ads falls far shortof the real needs for many larger newspapers.andP;  Someone has to worry aboutproblems such as getting the right artwork  electronically) to the right textand eventually to the right ad.andP;  At output time, these graphic components,which may be scattered around the system on CD-ROM, workstation disks andcentral file servers, all have to come together.andP;  And at the end of thecycle, when the newspaper wants to purge the system of old ads, someone orsome piece of software has to kill all of the associated artwork.andM;This is not something you get with a $695 shrink-wrapped, single-user displayad makeup soft-ware package.andP;  Somebody has to add the glue that tieseverything together into a productive system.andP;  In smaller papers, this canoften be done by the newspaper staff.andP;  In larger configurations, aprofessional system integrator may be needed.andP;  But in all cases, somebody hasto do the work.andM;In LeDroit's case, Systemhouse opted for a basic file server running underAppleShare and some well-defined copy-flow procedures (along with manual fileand folder maintenance procedures) to address these concerns.andP;  SCS's role wasto provide the copy entry and networking software that augmented the businesssystem's order-entry functions.andM;As at most newspapers, the original ad sales orders are logged into LeDroit'sIBM business system.andP;  The ad is given a unique number that will track the ad(and all of its components) throughout the system.andP;  Ad jackets are used tocontain components of ads as they are passed from department to department.andM;The first split in the ad's copy flow is to send the text to be typed in thegraphic department and any graphics to be scanned to the dedicated scanningoperators (along with any specific instructions for sizing, etc.).andP;  A singleMacintosh II graphics/ads file server is the primary central storehouse forall elements at this stage.andP;  As each ad is typed under the designated adnumber, it is placed in the raw text folder on the graphic file server.andP;  Asartwork is scanned, it is also sent to a single folder on this same server.andO;Each piece of art has the same ad number as its text file, plus an extensiondistinguishing the different pieces of artwork for the same ad.andP;  Each admakeup artist works at one of six Mac IIci work-stations, each with its own80-MB (or larger) hard disk.andP;  Four of the Macs are equipped with largegray-scale monitors; two have color monitors.andP;  The color units also haveCD-ROM drives that contain clip-art files used in display ads.andP;  A graphicartist beginning to build an ad creates a unique folder on the local drive,using the ad number as the folder name.andP;  Into this folder are copied thecorresponding text file and any scanned graphic files from their respectivefolders on the central graphics/ads file server.andP;  As a housecleaning measure,once the components have all been stored in the ad folder, the artist deletesthe original files from the file server to avoid later confusion.andP;  Any logosthat are needed from the logo folder (also located on the central graphicsserver) are also copied into the artist's ad folder.andM;If clip art is needed, it must first be copied from its CD-ROM to the centralfile server before it can be copied into an ad folder.andP;  This is a bitawkward, but it avoids a worse trade-off: AppleShare will only allow the&quot;mounting&quot; of volumes (putting new discs into a drive) at start-up.andP;  Sincethere are many different CD-ROM volumes to choose from, the file server wouldhave to be rebooted each time a new volume was loaded.andP;  Furthermore, becausethe file servers are not located in the same vicinity as the graphic artists,it would be inconvenient to load the required CDs.andM;As we mentioned above, several packages are used in the ad makeup process.andO;The graphic artists are trained on all of them and feel quite comfortablemoving from one to another.andP;  (Running on the Mac, all have a common userinterface.) If a scanned piece of line art is likely to require resizing orcoloring, it is converted to vector form using Streamline.andP;  Illustrations aregenerated and often manipulated using both Illustrator and FreeHand.andO;Multi-Ad Creator is the primary layout package, although for some work (suchas color ads), Quark and PageMaker are also used.andM;Each operator is responsible for cleaning up his own unnecessary files.andP;  Forexample, extraneous files may be created as scanned line art is passedthrough Streamline, into Illustrator, possibly into FreeHand and then intoCreator.andP;  This is not a small newspaper, yet the graphic artists don't seemto have any trouble with what many would consider a &quot;system manager's job.&quot;andO;We were only a little surprised at their willingness to manage much of theirown data.andP;  We heard similar comments from workers at even larger papers whodon't mind managing their own data in return for total control of theirproduct.andP;  Many are looking for database management to help-notreplace-management procedures.andM;When the ad is completed, it is saved in the native &quot;working format&quot; of thesoftware package used to build the ad.andP;  This is the format that can berecalled to the screen for any changes or corrections.andP;  It is also saved inthe format best suited for placement onto Quark pages (usually PICT or EPS,depending on what program created the ad).andP;  The ad folder is then copied intothe appropriate &quot;editions folder&quot; for a single publication.andP;  It is alsoplaced in a general holding folder (for possible pick-up later that week) orinto a repeat ad folder if the ad is scheduled to run in another edition.andO;Here again the user is part of the copy flow and tracking mechanism in whatcould be described as a semi-manual approach to file management.andP;  But whenthe procedures are followed, the system works quite well.andP;  When they are not,it is not a big task for supervisors to track missing ads; they are all inthe system in electronic form, in only one or two possible places.andM;The next task for the artist is to delete all the raw files used to createthe ad and to route logos and graphics to appropriate folders if they arclikely to be used again.andP;  As a final step in the process, a supervisor(several times during the day) sends the Edition Folder, full of ads, to thepagination file server for eventual placement onto live news pages.andP;  Caremust be taken in all of these steps to ensure that the proper namingconventions have been maintained for ad and edition folders in order that thecorrect ads are properly linked automatically during pagination.andP;  This wouldbe the case with any multivendor or multisoftware system where ad numbersmust be exactly the same on several different subsystems (ad makeup, billing,ad dummying and pagination systems).andM;Further ad management is also required at the system level.andP;  Each artist isresponsible for cleaning up his own hard drive at the beginning of each day.andO;In normal circumstances, the disk would have all the ads from the previousday on it.andP;  These exist in two other locations and can be deleted daily.andP;  Thesupervisor maintains the central file server, deleting ads On' it that aremore than one week old.andP;  The backup for ads more than a week old is a tapethat contains all ads that have been run in the paper.andM;User commentsandM;Most users we talk to about projects of this type are naturally proud of whatthey have accomplished, even when their vendor has clearly done aless-than-admirable job.andP;  But LeDroit backed up its praise for its approach,its system integrator, and its accomplishments with specifics.andP;  The bottomline for this newspaper is that it got exactly the system it planned for, ontime and for a very reasonable cost.andM;First, the paper got what it wanted.andP;  Together with the system integrator,management evaluated and selected the individual hardware and softwareproducts it wanted to use.andP;  It let the system integrator design an overallapproach that would marry the individual programs.andP;  The result was a systemthat found its editors and graphics people taking to it  Like ducks towater.' They enjoyed the opportunity to use the new technology, found thetraining coordinated by Systemhouse to be invaluable, and have exceededeveryone's expectations in their use of the system.andM;How did they feel about changing from a mature, sophisticated Atex system toa multiplicity of desktop programs? In general, very good.andP;  In the area ofbasic writing and editing tools, the users find the system &quot;transparent&quot;(i.e., equally sophisticated) and not much of a change.andP;  As for copy flow,the SCS system mimics much of the queue structure and copy movement duringthe initial editing stages that the Atex system supported.andP;  As for pagemakeup, LeDroit used to do about 30% of its pages using Atex GT68s; theoperators find the new system &quot;much less manual&quot; today, with much bettertools.andM;Procedurally, the makeup people (deskers) arc doing the same job they didbefore, but much more completely because they now place the ads and scannedphotos.andP;  They also find it much easier to remake pages for late-breakingstories (as they did for the recent death of Sammy Davis Jr.).andP;  They can holdthe sports section open later for important events like the recenttriple-overtime hockey win of Edmonton over Boston.andP;  (Our local paper simplyreported that the two teams went into overtime; we wanted to know who won.)andO;As a result, they are doing many more recasts of sports pages-much of thisbecause they are going direct to negative (another time saver of thissystem).andM;The users also feel  free.&quot; They felt &quot;locked in&quot; with their old vendor,subject to its prices and timetables for any requested change.andP;  Today LeDroitdoesn't feel any single software package in its new system is absolutelycritical.andP;  Many parts arc significant, but the structure allows replacing anycomponent when a better program or subsystem is developed.andP;  For example,editors are already asking for a spelling checker and a thesaurus-somethingthey are likely to get in an eventual upgrade to PC editing stations.andP;  Whydidn't they get it in their current system? Time-LeDroit only had threemonths to put together the entire system, so it took an editing system thatmost closely fit in with the pagination and ad dummying software.andP;  Buttomorrow is another story !andP;  The users also like the price of the new system.andO;Including the cost of the integrator, the total was less than $1.6 millionCanadian ($1.37 million U.S.) Current estimates put this at a quarter of thecost of the old system (including maintenance over three years), which wasonly paginating 30% of the pages and had no graphics, no ad dummying and nocolor.andM;Lastly, LeDroit made it clear that Systemhouse is its system integrationvendor.andP;  This is not to take anything away from the many vendors (especiallySCS) that cooperated in building and developing this system.andP;  However,Systemhouse managed the project, organized the training to make the usersproductive, wrote the internal operational procedures (an excellent documentthat describes how LeDroit should use this collection of software), andcontinues to tune and help maintain the system.andM;We experienced first-hand why LeDroit feels this way.andP;  During our visit,there was a system crash, thanks in part to a fire in the building requiringa hasty shutdown of the system and forcing us to evacuate to the rainyoutdoors.andP;  It was Systemhouse that came in, rolled up its sleeves-side byside with the internal system team-and helped get the paper back on track.andM;ConclusionsandM;We began researching this article with the idea of identifying areas whereoff-the-shelf desktop programs fall short of satisfying the multiuser needsof professional publishers.andP;  As it turned out, that became a secondary focus.andO;We hope we have shed some fight on where system-level problems may surfacewhen using products that were primarily intended for single-userenvironments.andP;  But the real story tamed out to be how one user (with the helpof a professional system integrator) tied diverse off-the-shelf packages intoa coherent system with a very smooth (albeit manual and procedurally driven)copy flow that clearly works in a middle-size (64-page) daily newspaper withcolor.andM;As you can tell, we were impressed with what we saw.andP;  It is truly anintegrated system-fourth-wave technology at its best.andP;  It has exposed some ofthe limitations of desktop software, but it has also surmounted them.andP;  Forexample, the rather manual copy flow is a giant step beyond the industry'sinitial attempts to use these off-the-shelf packages on simple networks orstandalone devices; it is also a lot better than &quot;sneaker-net,&quot; still beingused by many newspapers.andP;  The limitations are not inherent in the technology,only in the degree to which it has been integrated.andP;  AppleShare, which is theheart of LeDroit's filing structure, is not a real newspaper database.andP;  Itisn't hard to project the significant improvement in automated copy flow andsystem maintenance that will likely result from te additional integration ofa proper database.andP;  The technology already exists; it just has to be put touse.andM;We were equally impressed with something else we saw: a true &quot;systemintegrator.&quot;andP;  Systemhouse is not a developer or a distributor trying to sellone particular flavor of equipment.andP;  It is an independent system architect-adexample of a new breed--that can match the objectives of the client with anopen system offering both functionality and performance.andP;  Our hat is off toSystemhouse, which (together with Software Consulting Services) did anexcellent job of designing, installing and implementing a well-organizedsystem, in a very tight timeframe, for a very attractive price.andM;This doesn't signal the end of the traditional vendor.andP;  But it does open thedoor for what many newspapers, magazines, and other professional or largecasual publishing clients have been looking for-an independent, knowledgeablesystem integrator who will take full responsibility for designing andmaintaining an open, fourth-generation system.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
