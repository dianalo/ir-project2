(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   To many optimists on the investmentoutlook for the 1990s, the magic word is ``demographics.''   Whatever the short-term ups and downs of the economy over thenext 10 years, they believe shifting trends in the shape and makeupof the U.S. population will spur savings and investment.   That theme was sounded over and over again last week as WallStreet leaders attending the annual convention of the SecuritiesIndustry Association assessed the outlook for their troubledbusiness.   ``The demographics are going with us for the first time in 10 to15 years,'' declared Robert Goodman, senior economist at the firmof Putnam Financial Services Inc.   About 20 years ago, the economy began facing the challenge ofabsorbing into the workforce the huge generation, both men andwomen, that was born after World War II.   Once millions of those people found jobs and careers, theyacquired the image _ whether entirely accurate or not _ of bigspenders unconcerned about the long term.   Though perhaps not for that reason alone, the nation's savingsrate dragged along at what many analysts described as dangerouslylow levels.   In the '90s, however, many baby boomers will be moving intotheir 40s and 50s _ traditionally the time of life when peoplereach their peak earning power and want to start putting money awayin earnest for their later years.   Whether this generation wants to do that or not, many observerssay, it is going to feel an increasing sense that it needs to doso. No outside source, government or private, is likely to have themeans to cover more than a fraction of their retirement needs,analysts say.   ``No generation has ever faced this kind of financialliability,'' said John Steffens, president of Merrill LynchConsumer Markets, an arm of the big investment firm.   ``The requirement for savings, I think, is more compelling thanever before.''   In the understandable reasoning of Wall Street's marketingplanners, a greater impulse to save means greater demand forstocks, mutual funds, tax-sheltered retirement programs,certificates of deposit _ in short, just about every product andservice the financial-services industry has to sell. Even advice.   ``People today require more and better advice on financialmatters,'' Steffens said.   A corollary to this baby-boom theory focuses on the ``babybust'' that followed, when birth rates fell sharply in the '60s andearly '70s.   Barring a huge influx of immigrants, that is expected to mean adramatic slowing during the '90s of the growth in the labor force.   Though that might not be good news for all industries, manyanalysts believe it too will be a stimulus to savings andinvestment, by increasing demand for labor-saving businessequipment.   ``Fewer young people will lead to labor shortages and largecapital spending on automation,'' said John Gutfreund, chairman andchief executive of Salomon Brothers Inc.   As any experienced demographer readily attests, predicting thefuture based on population projections alone is a chancy endeavor.   Now, in particular, crystal balls of this type are clouded bythe international forces that influence the domestic economy.   Besides, despite all their clout, it is a lot to expect of thebaby boomers to assure by themselves the health and well-being ofthe financial world.   Granted, the experts say. But they have it within their power tomake a big difference.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Mon Dec. 4</NOTE></DOC>
