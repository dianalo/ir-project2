<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-14-0453 </DOCNO><TEXT>The behaviour of the coercivity field of solid solutions on the basisof lead zirconate-titanate (TZh) is considered using the expressionsof free energy, taking into account the calculations of the coercivityfield of barium titanate for the temperature interval including the -5deg C point. It is shown that the polarization vector causes to be parallelto the vector of the applied field when the latter decreases in its valueand the composition of the solid solution is based on lead zirconate-titanateconfirming to the boundary of the morphotropic phase transition region.The consequence of this is the deviation of the hysteresis loop configurationfrom the usual one and decrease of the coercivity field. The phenomenonis analogous to the observed one at low-temperature transition in bariumtitanate.</TEXT></DOC>
