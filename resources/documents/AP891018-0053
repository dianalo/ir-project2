Keating, Federal DepositInsurance Corp. Chairman L. William Seidman said Tuesday in sworntestimony before the House Banking Committee.   Keating, chairman of American Continental Corp., the parentcompany of Lincoln Savings and Loan Association of Irvine, Calif.,gave money to the campaigns of Sens. Alan Cranston, D-Calif.;Dennis DeConcini, D-Ariz.; John McCain, R-Ariz.; John Glenn,D-Ohio, and Donald W. Riegle Jr., D-Mich.   In April 1987, the five met with regulators on Keating's behalf.   DeConcini and Riegle have since returned Keating'scontributions, but the citizens' group Common Cause last week askedthe Senate Ethics Committee to investigate the matter.   Common Cause also asked the Justice Department to determinewhether the contributions violated the law, but Seidman's statementis the first sign that a federal agency is actively pursuing thematter.   Meanwhile, Seidman suggested strongly that the government waitedthree years too long before trying to contain the Lincoln failure,expected to be the nation's costliest.   The FDIC chief said if his agency had been regulating Lincoln itwould have sought in 1986 to take it over or issue an orderstopping abuses.   That would have prevented some of what Seidman estimates will bea $1.5 billion to $2 billion loss to taxpayers. The government tookcontrol of the thrift in April.   ``We're looking at the biggest bank heist in history,'' saidRep. Jim Leach, R-Iowa, at the first of four scheduled hearings onLincoln.   Seidman refrained from directly criticizing M. Danny Wall, thetop U.S. thrift regulator. But his assessment raised questionsabout Wall's decision to delay action against Lincoln frommid-1987, when he took office, until April 14 of this year.   Lincoln was seized by Wall's agency, the Federal Home Loan BankBoard, and turned over the FDIC, which insures bank and Sandamp;Ldeposits. Last month the government filed a $1.1 billion civilfraud and racketeering suit charging that Keating, his family andassociates diverted Lincoln's deposits for their personal use.   A March 12, 1986, examination by the San Francisco branch of thebank board found that Lincoln had violated rules limiting riskydirect investments in commercial ventures, was not in compliancewith accounting standards, had substantial loan losses, hadinadequate and missing records and was speculating in junk bonds.   ``My staff indicated that had we made such findings in one ofour own institutions, we would have sought an immediatecease-and-desist order to stop the hazardous operations,'' Seidmansaid.   The focus of the House panel's probe is Wall's decision, aftermeeting with Keating, to order a second examination byWashington-based regulators to confirm the findings of the SanFrancisco office, delaying action against the thrift.   However, committee chairman Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, D-Texas,said he has not ruled out asking the senators to appear before thepanel if later testimony shows their intervention caused the delay.   Gonzalez said Cranston offered about a month ago to appearbefore the committee. Riegle issued a statement saying he wasproviding information to the Senate ethics panel and was preparedto share the same information with the House.   Seidman also testified it was ``fairly clear'' Keating wastipped off to the April 14 seizure because a day earlier AmericanContinental filed for bankruptcy, complicating government effortsto recover part of the cost of the Sandamp;L failure.   Additional hearings are scheduled Oct. 24, Oct. 31 and Nov. 7.Keating and Wall are not scheduled to appear until the last session.</TEXT></DOC>
