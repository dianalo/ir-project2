The transaction has an indicated value of about $125.6 million.    Roadway, owner of Roadway Express Inc., a large motor freight carrier, and other trucking subsidiaries, has begun a cash tender offer.    In addition, Roadway said it has an option, subject to certain circumstances, to purchase up to 800,000 common shares at $35.50 a share from Viking, based in San Jose, Calif. Those shares represent about 20% of Viking's fully diluted shares outstanding, Roadway said. At the end of the second quarter, Viking had 3,539,000 common shares outstanding.    Also, Roadway said it has an option agreement to purchase a 5% stake in Viking from shareholders who are also directors and officers of Viking. Roadway said it would pay $35.50 a share for those shares.    Viking, parent of Viking Freight System Inc., a regional less-than-truckload carrier, in recent years has expanded from its California base into a western regional carrier, serving 10 states, including Alaska and Hawaii. It had 1987 revenue of $192.8 million.    News of the definitive pact caused Viking to leap $13 a share in national over-the-counter trading yesterday, to close at $34.75, while Roadway slipped 50 cents a share, to $28.50.    In a news release, Viking's president, Randolph C. Bangham, called the proposed transaction &quot;in the best interests&quot; of the company and its shareholders and added that it will permit Viking to &quot;continue to grow and prosper.&quot; He declined to elaborate until certain filings have been completed.    In the fiscal six months ended June 25, Viking's net income rose 27% to $2.9 million, or 83 cents a share, on a 13% gain in revenue to $99 million. </TEXT></DOC>
