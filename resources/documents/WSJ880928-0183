He's doing his Korean military service on the U.S. Army base in Seoul. But as a student at elite Yonsei University and proud of South Korea's new international prestige, he scorns the menial jobs his countrymen have done for the American military.    &quot;Most of us Katusas are better educated than the GIs,&quot; says Mr. Ohn, who was born a decade after the Korean War ended. &quot;It isn't the 1950s anymore. It's time for a change in our relations. It's time that we had a Korean, not an American, in charge.&quot;    The confidence and even arrogance of young Koreans like Mr. Ohn would be a shock to many Americans who served in the Korean War. They would remember Katusas, an acronym for Koreans serving in the U.S. Army, as soldiers who were often treated with little respect and who took American superiority for granted.    Today, the tables are turning. Koreans, proud of their new economic and political status -- the Olympics are the latest sign -- are demanding more equality in their longstanding defense partnership with the U.S. That spells change on the most volatile front of the U.S. Pacific security perimeter. Moreover, it comes at a time when the U.S. is embroiled in tough negotiations to keep its bases in the Philippines.    The Korean and U.S. governments are discussing giving Korea more control over its own troops and lowering the American military profile in Seoul. A freer press is beginning to report demands for the withdrawal of U.S. nuclear weapons from the peninsula. Many Korean government officials and intellectuals, spurred by a more vocal and self-confident public, want changes to make Korea more like a full-fledged U.S. ally than a protectorate.    President Roh Tae Woo recently said for the first time that he &quot;could foresee some reduction of the American presence on the peninsula if North Korea is sincere in (its) efforts for peaceful reunification and the approach is without any military threat.&quot; Analysts say this signals a small but significant change: In pursuing improved relations with the North, Seoul is confident enough to say it would consider adjusting its relations with the U.S.    That doesn't necessarily mean any sudden changes. Seoul is careful to discuss change in the context of its continuing desire for a U.S. presence. Officials say U.S. ground forces are still necessary as a deterrent, and U.S. air and intelligence capabilities will probably be essential to Korea and the U.S. for some time.    Widespread popular protest for withdrawal of U.S. troops isn't likely in the near future. Still, the subject of troop reduction isn't taboo as it once was. The U.S. has 43,000 troops in South Korea, complementing a South Korean force of about 600,000. The North has about 875,000 troops.    &quot;Though there isn't a consensus on either the U.S. or Korean side, we have an understanding that it's time to start thinking about discussions on adjusting the size and role of U.S. forces here,&quot; says Cha Young Koo, a senior analyst at the government's Korea Institute for Defense Analyses. Withdrawal of U.S. troops is the touchiest of bilateral defense issues. President Carter's unilateral decision to pull out forces 10 years ago was reversed in the face of strong opposition on both sides of the Pacific.    But circumstances are different now. The South's economy is about five times larger than the North's. Its weapons, though fewer, are considered more advanced. Just as important, ordinary South Koreans as well as intellectuals say they believe they will be able to protect themselves soon and want to handle their own defense.    Similarly, some U.S. congressmen, irritated by Korea's $10 billion trade surplus with the U.S. last year, would like to spend less money protecting South Korea, even though Seoul allocates 6% of the value of all its goods and services to defense, far more than most American allies.    &quot;By the early 1990s the U.S. can begin to contemplate withdrawal of most of its forces,&quot; says Amos Jordan, professor of strategy and diplomacy at Georgetown University's Center for Strategic and International Studies. &quot;We should deal with the problem and not fight it.&quot;    Both the U.S. and Korea want changes in the command structure of their forces. The U.S. is eager to adjust the relationship so it doesn't appear an American is responsible for misbehavior or political action by the Korean military. Many Koreans hold the U.S. responsible for the brutal suppression of a civilian uprising at Kwangju in 1980 by Korean forces, even though the American commander at the time says the Korean government, not the U.S., had control of the troops used.    An American four-star general heads the Combined Forces Command that forms Korea's main defense against the North. The majority of the combined forces' troops are Korean, and its commander answers to both governments. But he is seen by many Koreans as a foreigner in charge of their army.    Perceived inequities in the command structure have grated on Koreans for some time, as does the Americans' 669-acre Yongsan base, whose golf course, housing and headquarters occupy some of Seoul's choicest downtown real estate. &quot;I feel uncomfortable walking around the walls of the base with the Keep Out signs,&quot; says Son Jeong Sook, a 32-year-old secretary. &quot;It reminds me of the old days when we were nothing -- when we were poor and weak and needed American help. I don't like the feeling of this foreign place in Seoul.&quot;    An anti-nuclear movement may be gaining steam for the first time. Many Koreans were surprised recently when government-run television broadcast a call by a retired American general for the removal of land-based nuclear weapons from the country. Retired Gen. John Cushman argued that nuclear weapons serve only to fuel anti-American sentiment that could undermine the alliance and that their removal would pre-empt demands by students and others.    This was the first time some viewers had heard of nuclear weapons here. The topic has been avoided in Korea -- both because of past government restrictions on public debate and because the U.S. won't confirm or deny their presence. </TEXT></DOC>
