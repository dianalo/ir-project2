But it will not work,'' EastGerman leader Erich Honecker said in a speech earlier this week.   The state-run Berliner Zeitung in the Communist capital accusedWest Germany of trying to ``provoke conflict and increase tensionin Europe'' by allegedly luring the refugees.   Genscher rejected those charges in a radio interview Wednesdayand again called for reforms rejected by East Berlin's Communistleadership.   ``A reform movement can only be carried out with politicalstability,'' Genscher said in an interview with NorddeutscheRundfunk. ``The federal government is opposed to anydestabilization by words or deeds.''   Government officials in Bonn also have denied East Germanallegations that West Germany is attracting the refugees with falsepromises.   Still, West German employers and government officials have madeno secret of their delight in having the refugees, whose numbershave topped 43,000 since Hungary opened its borders to the West onSept. 11.   Most of the refugees are young, skilled workers, who ordinarilywould form the backbone of the East German economy. East Germanyalready has admitted that the country's dissatisfied work force issuffering.   Genscher made it clear Bonn has no intention of changing courseto placate East Germany.   ``The West German embassies will stay open,'' Genscher said.   The latest arrivals headed to Bavaria from the West GermanEmbassy in Prague.   Despite the war of words between the two countries, numerousquestions remain as to whether West Germany has an ulterior motivein welcoming newcomers to one of Europe's most densely populatedcountries.   The latest wave in the exodus comes just days before the 40thanniversary of the founding of East Germany, and some East Germanofficials say Bonn is trying to embarrass it during the plannedcelebrations.   Many politicians in Bonn also are looking ahead to the era afterthe rule of Erich Honecker, the 77-year-old leader of East Germany.Chancellor Helmut Kohl's government has vowed to continue pressingEast Berlin to make political reforms, even though there are noindications that Honecker's successor will be interested inundertaking them.   Beyond that, West German leaders are looking forward even moreeagerly to their goal of reunification with East Germany, whichthey say can only come about if the two countries are joined in aWestern-style democratic system.   East Germany also has accused West Germany of supporting thegrowing opposition movement within the Communist country.</TEXT></DOC>
