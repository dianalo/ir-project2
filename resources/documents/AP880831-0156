ANDREWS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Library of Congress said Wednesday it hasreceived a major gift of several thousand documents written bycomposers, musicians and literary figures dating to the 12thcentury, including hand-written musical scores by Beethoven, Chopinand Mendelssohn.   The library said the bequest from Hans Moldenhauer, a Spokane,Wash., pianist, teacher and musicologist who died last October, wasthe greatest composite gift in the history of its music division,whose collection already contained more than 8 million items.   The bequest, received in July, represents the overwhelming bulkof the Moldenhauer collection, which the library described as ``oneof the greatest archives of musical primary source materials everassembled.''   The inventory of more than 400 pages lists several thousandmusic manuscripts, letters and documents. The oldest apparently is18 lines of Latin text on vellum, with musical notations, from a12th century German prayer book.   Among the many composers represented in the collection is a copyin Ludwig van Beethoven's handwriting of music from Mozart's opera,``Don Giovanni,'' probably written as studies for portions ofBeethoven's only opera, ``Fidelio.''   Also included are handwritten scores of Frederic Chopin'sPrelude for Piano in A flat; Cesar Franck's Prelude, Choral andFugue for solo piano; the sextet from Giacomo Puccini's opera, ``LaBoheme;'' Felix Mendelssohn's arrangement of the unpublishedoverture to ``Elijah'' for two pianos; and a major section of thecoronation scene from Nicolai Rimsky-Korsakoff's arrangement of theMussorgsky opera, ``Boris Godunov.''   In the collection is a letter written by English composer GeorgeFrederic Handel describing specifications for an organ to be builtfor the restored home of his collaborator, Charles Jennens. It wasdescribed as one of the very few Handel letters that discussesmusical matters.   The Moldenhauer archives were established at the Library ofCongress last year with several gifts which were supplementedearlier this year by major manuscripts of Johannes Brahms that wereacquired from Moldenhauer's widow, Mary.   The combined collection includes many important documents fromcomposers Arnold Schoenberg and Anton von Webern, the library said,including an unpublished Schoenberg composition that will be playedfor the first time at the library's Coolidge Auditorium.   The Moldenhauer Archives Foundation, established by the Germanimmigrant who arrived in the United States in 1938, will financethe library's publication of an illustrated history of Westernmusic based primarily on the Moldenhauer collection.</TEXT></DOC>
