Phone support has been a bone of contention betweencustomers and software makers for years. The companies sayanswering questions is time-consuming and costly. Customerssay they have to call because software and instructions areincomprehensible.   The software makers, which have started charging $1 to $2a minute, justify the fees by saying they pay forimprovements in service. Buttonware Inc., a Bellevue, Wash.,maker of PC File, a $129 database, says it has doubled thenumber of advisers since beginning a $1-a-minute 900 line.&quot;We thought we'd get roasted,&quot; says a spokeswoman. &quot;But wefound that people are willing to pay. They just want thehelp.&quot;   Industry giant Microsoft Inc. has installed a 900 line tohelp people with questions about MS-DOS, the operatingsystems it designed but sells through other companies. In thepast, it didn't provide much help to puzzled DOS users, nordid anyone else, customers say. Lotus Development Corp.,maker of best-selling spreadsheet 1-2-3, and Aldus Corp.,maker of the desktop publishing program PageMaker, are alsotrying out 900 numbers.   Russ Walter, a computer-book author in Somerville, Mass.,who answers phone queries for free, says, &quot;I'd hate to see itbecome the norm.&quot; After all, he says, &quot;one marketing pitch isthat they support their customers.&quot; Another problem: Manycompanies have switchboards that block users from dialing 900numbers.                                                                                                          Checking Photo I.D.s   On a Computer Screen   INVENTORS have struggled for years to meld computers withsecurity systems.   Various companies already have marketed electronic devicesthat check identities by examining eyes or by sensing thespeed and pressure with which people write their names.   Now, Sacody Technologies Inc., New York, has developed astraightforward system that lets clerks or security guardscall up stored photos and signatures on a three-inch screen.Because pictures of authorized customers or employees arestored on a disk, crooks can't get by with forgedidentification cards.   Sacody has devised a way to compress identificationphotographs to 5,000 bytes of information, allowing storageof 5,000 photos on a 30-megabyte personal-computer disk.Without compression, a photo takes about 50,000 bytes. Theamount of data is small enough so the information can be sentfrom a disk to a Sacody terminal in six seconds on alocal-area network or 15 seconds over a regular phone line.   One early user, Turtle Cove Golf Club, a New York drivingrange, says the system helps workers confirm that a golferhas credit in his account before handing out a bucket ofballs.                                                                                                          MIPS Keeps Slipping   As a Speed Standard                                                                                                          THE COMMON measure of computer speed, MIPS, is an acronymfor millions of instructions per second, but cynicalcustomers joke that it means meaningless indicator ofprocessor speed or even marketing instructions for pushysalespeople.   Now, a new suite of measurements called SPEC, which isbeing used widely by makers of engineering workstations,makes clear just how meaningless MIPS can be. The 10 SPECbenchmark programs were designed to provide consistent speedcomparisons among computers doing various types of jobs.   John R. Mashey, a vice president at MIPS Computer SystemsInc., a Sunnyvale, Calif., workstation maker, recentlycompared vendors' MIPS speed claims with their reported SPECperformance numbers. It turns out the customers have a rightto be cynical. While Mr. Mashey says the vendors hadlegitimate reasons for their MIPS claims, the ratings couldbadly mislead customers.   In the study, Mr. Mashey concludes that one of hiscompany's workstations rated at 20 MIPS &quot;shows similarperformance on integer programs&quot; to an International BusinessMachines Corp. RS/6000 rated at 34.5 MIPS and is twice asfast as a Sun Microsystems Inc. 12.5 MIPS workstation. ADigital Equipment Corp. VAX workstation's SPEC performancetranslates into about 90% of its claimed MIPS, but a DigitalRISC workstation is about 83%.   Overall, Mr. Mashey says that actual performance asmeasured by SPEC ranges from 54% to 96% of companies' MIPSclaims. In floating-point operations, which reflectscientific performance, differences range from 34% to 135%.&quot;There is no such thing as a MIPS rating that means much,&quot; heconcludes.                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          JAPANESE companies invested a record $320 million in smallU.S. technology companies last year, says Venture EconomicsInc., a Wellesley, Mass., research firm. Even without the$100 million investment by Canon Inc. in Stephen Jobs's NextInc., that was 25% higher than the $176 million recorded in1988. . . . Philip Emeagwali, a Nigerian graduate student atthe University of Michigan, won the Gordon Bell Prize forlast year's most cost-effective supercomputer program, asimulation of an underground oil reservoir that he wrote forthe Connection Machine, a computer with 65,000microprocessors connected together. The fastest conventionalsupercomputers link eight very powerful processors. Mr.Emeagwali compares big processors to oxen and small ones tochickens: &quot;If the chickens coordinate their efforts, they'lldo a better job.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
