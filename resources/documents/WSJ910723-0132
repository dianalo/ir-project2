Just south ofPittsburgh.   The setting might seem odd, but the lord of this manor is68-year-old Joe Hardy Sr., a Pittsburgh native and owner of84 Lumber Co. who bought the title last year for nearly$170,000 at a London auction. Exactly a year to the day, he'sinviting 1,000 of his friends to his western Pennsylvaniastomping grounds to celebrate the anniversary of hiselevation.</LP><TEXT>   The site of next Sunday's gala is the new $8 million,chandelier-festooned grand ballroom of Mr. Hardy's NemacolinWoodlands, a financially struggling spa-resort-conventioncomplex. A sizable chunk of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestraand a group of costumed bagpipers and drummers will play asthe guests feast on caviar, champagne and banquet fare.   In attendance will be Edward Heath, a former British primeminister much admired by Mr. Hardy. And the guest of honorwill be David S.D. Lodder, the steward of the manor ofHenley-in-Arden, who is formally responsible for lookingafter any manorial affairs that arise in England while thelumber baron is in the States.   Among the titled heads who have received imitationparchment invitations and plan to attend are the lord andlady of the manor of Croughton, Northhamptonshire. It's not along journey for them: Nicholas Kittrie and his wife,Georgette Sobel, who insist they bought their titles forconsiderably less than Mr. Hardy, live a half-day's driveaway.   However, the lord and lady of the manors of Beedon andStratford St. Andrews have respectfully declined -- due toextenuating circumstances. &quot;We sold both our titles for$30,000 to raise some cash to keep our business going,&quot;explains the former lord of the manor, now simply ArtWilliams, 66, a Dallas architect.   Robert Smith, chairman of the Manorial Society of GreatBritain, which auctions titles to enthusiastic Anglophilesthe world over, will fly in from London to attend the partyand deliver a 17th century English painting that the Hardyfamily bought for Nemacolin Woodlands. Mr. Smith says titlessell for an average of $8,000 each, and he believes Mr. Hardymay have set a monetary record with his purchase.   Mr. Hardy finds his title amusing. &quot;It's just a biglaugh,&quot; he says. &quot;It's like the emperor marching in theparade without any clothes. Only I admit it.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
