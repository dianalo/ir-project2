 After all, at the start of the decade hardwarestandards such as the PC and the Macintosh simply didn't exist and none oftoday's best-selling software packages had appeared.andP;  With the businessgrowing so quickly from infancy to maturity, surely every product andtechnology which was launched was significant?andM;Well, no.andP;  Some products which looked innovative and spectacular at launch,such as the touch-screen on Hewlett-Packard's 1983 vintage HP150, havedisappeared without trace; other more modest developments have had dramaticeffects--for better or worse--on the shape of today's familiar PCenvironment.andP;  For example, who could have predicted that the command languagebuilt into the Hayes Smartmodem 300 would still, eight years after itslaunch, be the standard means of controlling modems running at speeds up tofifty times higher?andM;Who could possibly have thought that the eight-plus-three file-namingconventions of MS-DOS, only implemented in 1981 because that was how thethen-standard CP/M operating system did things, would still be causingmislaid files and frustration eight years later?andM;Standards established at the very beginning of the decade have probably hadthe greatest influence on later events, and that's reflected by the spacegiven to each year of the decade in what follows here.andM;The maligned Sinclair ZX80 for instance, launched in the year its namesuggests, was the introduction to computing for many of the young programmersand engineers now working in the UK PC industry.andP;  This is a prime example ofa product that wasn't significant for what it could do, but for its catalyticaction in computer literacy and awareness in this country.andP;  Without it,arguably, the UK would be even further behind the US, Japan and Europe incomputerization.andM;Similarly, Shugart's introduction of the 5-1/4-inch Winchester disk drive in1980 was more important for its effect on customer perceptions than as aproduct in its own right.andM;For the first time it became conceivable to build a hard disk into a smalldesktop enclosure, or even into a portable computer, although the Shugartdrive was too expensive for one application and too fragile for the second.andO;Today, although its height, fragility and power requirements have all beenreduced, the 5-1/4 inch Winchester disk has become the essential standardfitting for all except the smallest PCs.andM;But if 1980 laid some of the groundwork for the PC industry, it was 1981 thatbrought the major products and the major influences that have governed thebusiness ever since.andP;  In April of that year, Adam Osborne introduced theOsborne 1; in May, Xerox launched the Star and in August came the IBM PC,complete with a new operating system called MS-DOS.andM;The Osborne 1 was the first portable computer, although in today's terms itwould be described as a luggable.andP;  It had a Z80 processor, 64Kb of RAM, two88Kb 5-1/4 inch floppy disk drives and a 5-inch CRT display that coulddisplay 25 lines of 52 characters each and acted as a scrolling window on an80x25 text display.andP;  It ran the CP/M operating system, giving users access toa wide range of software.andM;In a remarkable coup that was perhaps Adam Osborne's major contribution, itcame with a complete set of business applications including CP/M marketleaders like WordStar, a VisiCalc clone called SuperCalc, and--shortlyafterwards--dBase II and a program generator called Personal Pearl, allbundled at a price of $1,795.andM;The Osborne 1 was an important machine for several reasons.andP;  First, itintroduced users to the idea of computers being portable and was thereforethe ancestor of every portable and laptop system launched since.andP;  Second, itwas a complete business system that came out of the box ready to run,complete with applications that didn't have to be tweaked to work.andP;  Comparedwith other CP/M systems and applications, this was a great leap forward.andO;Third, it was cheap for its day--so cheap that there were comments aboutOsborne selling software and throwing in a computer to run it on.andP;  In fact,Osborne had produced a neatly packaged all-in-one system that did for thebusiness market what Apple had done in homes and schools with the Apple II.andM;The Xerox Star, on the other hand, was a very expensive solution to problemsthat business users didn't know they had and a perfect engine forapplications that didn't exist.andM;Based on a proprietary Xerox processor called the Dandelion, it had a lot ofRAM, a high-resolution black-on-white bit-mapped display, and built-innetworking hardware and software that could connect it to a laser printer.andO;The operating system software, based on the object-oriented Smalltalklanguage, produced a WYSIWYG display with multiple overlapping windows,multiple fonts and typestyles faithfully shown on screen, bit-mapped paintsoftware and a text editor that could produce documents with integratedgraphics.andP;  Icons on the screen were used to control the email and networkservices and a mouse was used to activate icons and to select commands frompop-up menus that appeared at the mouse pointer position when required.andP;  Allthis cost a mere $50,000 or so.andM;It's impossible to overestimate the influence of this machine and thetechnology behind it.andP;  The graphical user interface concepts used wereinvented by Xerox for the Star, as was the Ethernet networking standard thatlinked the Star into other systems at the hitherto unheard of speed of10Mbits per second.andM;This machine, and Apollo Computer's roughly contemporary Domain DN-1000system, defined a new market for high-powered single-user computers that gaveindividuals unparalleled ease of use and performance in applications such asCAD, graphics, animation and artificial intelligence.andM;With the Star and the DN-1000, the work-station was born.andP;  And in a very realway, the Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, OS/2's Presentation Manager,OSF/Motif, the X-Windows System and the graphical interfaces built on it, andall the other graphics-based, bit-mapped, mouse-driven systems and softwareenvironments were born simultaneously in 1981.andM;The Star, of course, sold very few systems for Xerox.andP;  It was too expensiveand too different, and clearly--judging from recent history--too far ahead ofits time in terms of what it was trying to do with the hardware available.andM;Later the same year came the ultimate machine of its time, the IBM PC.andP;  Ifthe Star redefined the philosophy of computing, the IBM PC had no suchambitions.andP;  IBM took hardware technology off the shelf, borrowedarchitectural ideas from the Apple II, bought in a new CP/M clone for 16-bitprocessors--originally written by a small company in Seattle, but taken overby Microsoft for the PC project--and launched a home and education computer.andO;This came with 16Kb RAM, Basic in ROM, a TV modulator and a cassetteinterface, with floppy disk drives and 'professional' monochrome and colourmonitors available as options.andM;The history re-writers will say that IBM legitimized the businessmicrocomputer market with the PC.andP;  But it would be more accurate to say thatthe IBM dealers and retailers did the legitimizing, in conjunction withstart-up add-on manufacturers like Tecmar, Quadram and AST Research.andM;The dealers added memory, put in twin 160Kb floppy disk drives, installedmonochrome graphics/printer adaptors and green screens, and sold all-inbusiness systems to large companies who found the IBM name reassuring.andP;  Theadd-on board makers produced extra memory, communications and multi-functionboards for the PC's expansion slots, and in a classic inflationary spiral,these boards sold more PCs that produced more add-ons, that sold more PCs andso on, ad infinitum.andM;With a stable hardware platform and a relatively stable operating system --called MS-DOS by Microsoft and PC-DOS by IBM -- software developers had afixed target to aim at rather than the continually shifting CP/M market.andO;CP/M software had suffered from a multiplicity of terminals, printers andfloppy disk formats, so that software authors found themselves attempting tosupport dozens of different versions of their applications and ship them onmore than 50 different types of 5-1/4-inch floppy disk.andP;  With IBM's cloutfixing the hardware and the disk format and MS-DOS defining the softwareinterface, it was safe to develop something new.andM;The importance of the IBM PC and MS-DOS is undeniable.andP;  Neither of them werestate-of-the-art in 1981, but they did give the customers, hardware designersand software developers a rallying point around which they could direct a newindustry.andM;Indeed, Microsoft had promised that software developers would use MS-DOS tocontrol the PC hardware and that any MS-DOS licensee would therefore be ableto build a machine that wasn't a pure copy of IBM's but would still run IBMsoftware.andP;  This turned out to be nonsense, as the MS-DOS services for thingslike screen handling were so slow as to be unusable and software authorsbypassed the operating system to address the hardware directly and squeezeout extra performance.andP;  System makers could produce machines that would runMS-DOS, but couldn't, it seemed, make machines that ran all IBM software.andO;Unless, that is, they violated IBM patents and copyright by stealing thelow-level BIOS software in the PC.andM;This is why the launch of a hitherto unsung system, the Columbia DataProducts MPC, was one of the most important events of 1982.andP;  The MPC was thefirst true PC clone, with BIOS routines that worked exactly like those of thePC without being a direct copy of them, and would therefore run any softwarethat ran on the official IBM PC.andP;  Columbia had managed this by using a 'cleanroom' development technique, giving programmers a list of what the BIOS hadto do and making sure they never had sight of the IBM BIOS code.andP;  Testing theresulting software against the IBM version and giving the programmers moreand more refined specifications of what they had to do to attain closercompatibility, allowed Columbia to produce a BIOS clone without infringingIBM copyright.andM;This technique was also used by companies like Phoenix and Award to produceBIOS software which could then be licensed to prospective PC clone makers --and the clone rush had begun.andP;  Columbia was the first, but later in 1982, oneof today's giants, Compaq, came up with its own clone BIOS in anOsborne-style portable computer, giving full IBM compatibility.andM;The rise of the clones, and the competition between their manufacturers,drove down prices to such an extent that PCs became low-cost commodity itemsthat were bought by the skip-load and could be scrapped without major costpenalties when something better came along.andP;  The Columbia MPC started boththe slide in prices and the reduction in product lifetimes that has alteredthe pace of the PC business' development so dramatically.andM;So far, all the developments discussed have been in hardware and operatingsystems.andP;  But with a solid platform established, 1982 also saw the arrival ofsoftware that deserves placing alongside things like the Star and the MPC.andO;Lotus Development Corporation, a new start-up, produced an integrated packagecalled Lotus 1-2-3; and Autodesk came up with the first PC-based CAD program,AutoCAD.andM;These products set standards.andP;  Lotus 1-2-3's integration of spreadsheet andgraphics with a clean, simple and fast menuing interface showed corporatebuyers new things that PCs could do and, like the PC itself, it provided asuccessful standard that could be emulated in other types of software and inadd-on products.andP;  Meanwhile, AutoCAD opened up a new market area for PCs,despite the sluggishness of the program on a hard-disk PC with a CGA screen.andO;This was the package that proved that it was possible for low-cost computersto put professional quality CAD tools into the hands of individuals.andM;By March 1983, the market was broadening rapidly.andP;  The PC -- often inpartnership with Lotus 1-2-3 -- was established as the business standard inthe US and had finally started shipping in Europe.andP;  The luggable PC, typifiedby Compaq, had shown that portability was an issue.andP;  Then Tandy surprisedeveryone by taking portability a stage further with the Tandy Model 100, thefirst laptop computer.andM;The Model 100, built by Kyocera in Japan, was not a PC.andP;  But it was partlybecause of this that the machine was so important, because it defined a newmarket area for a second computer that could be used as a mobile peripheralto a traditional desktop machine.andP;  With its eight-line, 40-character display,built-in text editor and communications software, standard PC-style input andoutput ports, and integral modem that was never approved in the UK, and theability to run for long periods on four AA-size batteries, the Model 100 wasthe ideal machine for note-taking on the road, becoming the standardcompanion for journalists.andM;Tandy was brave enough to show that PC compatibility wasn't necessary forthis type of machine and more recent laptops from Cambridge Computer and nowPsion have shown that this market is still very much alive.andP;  Size, weight andtrue portability are the factors that made the Model 100 so successful, whenthey'd never even been considered as major issues before.andM;In hardware product terms, the rest of 1983 was a time of consolidation.andP;  Thehard-diskbased PC/XT was launched, cementing the PC standard's dominantposition, and more and more clones appeared on the increasingly crowdeddealers' shelves.andM;However, two underlying technologies of great significance were reachingfruition, although they didn't make much impact at the time.andM;October Shugart launched an optical WORM drive, costing $7,500, which held1Gb of data that couldn't be erased accidentally.andP;  In the same month, inJapan, the Canon laser printer engine was displayed and offered to othermanufacturers.andM;Although WORM technology is only moving slowly into general use, in the endit will be the preferred archiving and back-up medium for high-capacity PCs.andO;Shugart proved that such a product could be made relatively affordable, fiveyears after its first demonstration.andM;The Canon engine, with its 300dpi print resolution and eight-page-per-minutespeed, has had a remarkable effect on the printing industry and has been amajor influence on the way users now think about the presentation ofinformation on paper.andM;There was one more even worth recording in 1983; IBM launched the ill-fatedPCJr, which was finally killed off in 1985, in an attempt to penetrate thehome and education market that it missed with the original PC.andP;  While notparticularly important in the history of computing, this proved that IBMwasn't infallible in the PC business and that it had no divine right todominance.andP;  The toppling of IBM from its pedestal is certainly worthrecording.andM;With hindsight, there's no doubt at all about the major hardware event of1984.andP;  Apple's long-rumoured Macintosh arrived with 128Kb RAM, a singlefloppy disk drive, no hard disk support at all and a high price tag.andP;  But italso had a built-in graphical user interface using techniques borrowed fromXerox and two revolutionary software packages called MacWrite and MacPaint.andM;The enthusiasm generated by this underpowered machine among users, softwaredevelopers and everybody else who came into contact with it, was startling.andO;There was a significant minority of users who found the dominance of the IBMPC and MS-DOS stifling and were looking for an alternative that had somethingfresh to offer.andP;  The Macintosh provided it.andM;Despite all the talk about the Macintosh's ease-of-use being its main sellingpoint, it proved most popular among the highly knowledgeable hackers whowanted to dig around and find out how the user interface could do what itdid.andP;  In the event, these hackers -- and the other software developers whowere preached at by the Apple 'evangelists' -- produced software that carriedthe Macintosh past a sticky patch and into its current safe position as analternative to the MS-DOS standard.andP;  A position so safe as to warrant a newMacintosh column in PC User itself!andM;Close behind the Macintosh, though, was IBM's PC/AT.andP;  When it arrived inAugust 1984 it was the first PC to use the 80286 processor, with its dramaticspeed improvements over the 8088 in the PC and XT.andP;  A new floppy disk format,the PC Network hardware and software, and the addition of networking supportto MS-DOS, made sure that a new generation of clones would be produced, thatAutoCAD would have a superior platform to run on and that new applicationscould be written to take advantage of the superior speed.andM;But the AT's great promise, its ability to switch into 'protected mode' andgive programmers and users the vast expanse of 16Mb of RAM to play with, wasignored.andP;  As a faster version of the PC, the AT was immensely successful; asa multi-user or multi-tasking machine, it was a flop.andM;However, the promise of the Canon laser engine was certainly realized in thisyear, when Hewlett-PAckard launched the LaserJet printer built around it.andO;The LaserJet and its clones are so well established now that there's littleneed to emphasise its importance to the PC user.andP;  Beautifully designed andbuilt, with unsurpassed print quality, the LaserJet brought laser printing tothe desktop and, almost in passing, brought about the lingering death of thedaisywheel printer that had dominated the high-quality printer market for solong.andM;The first major development of 1985 was another Canon-engined laser printer,but compared with the LaserJet this one had rather different effects ondifferent sectors of the market.andP;  The Apple LaserWriter arrived in January,which had the same 300dpi resolution and eight page-per-minute speed as theLaserJet, but also had enough processing hardware to make it Apple's mostpowerful computer to date.andP;  This hardware was used to run the PostScript pagedescription language that Apple had licensed from its develper, AdobeSystems.andM;With PostScript, the Macintosh's multiple screen fonts and bit-mappedgraphics could be transferred onto paper in near-typeset quality, with mixedtext and graphic pages using multiple scalable fonts.andP;  Camera-ready artworkfor printing could be run off on a LaserWriter, or PostScript files sentstraight to the typesetter for printing off at even higher resolution butwith no distortion of the page layout.andP;  PostScript delivered deviceindependence and started the now major business of creating and shippingscalable outline fonts compatible with Adobe's specifications.andM;Combined with the Macintosh, the LaserWriter and PostScript opened up thefirst brand-new application area that had been seen for years.andP;  It was called'desktop publishing', and the man who coined the phrase, Aldus' PaulBrainerd, produced the definitive software package to drive theMacintosh/LaserWriter/typesetter combination to greatest effect.andP;  Aldus'PageMaker, now available for Windows and Presentation Manager as well as theMacintosh, deserves its place in the list of significant breakthroughs of the1980s.andM;It was a good year for periopherals.andP;  The NEC MultiSync, a remarkable monitorthat could cope with a wide range of resolutions up to 800x560, including allIBM standards, was released; it could cope with just about any type of inputsignal as well.andP;  Never again would anybody need to throw away a monitor whileupgrading a video board, although fixed-frequency monitors actually stillhave a place in the cheapest systems.andM;It was a good year too for the heart of the PC, the processor, as Intelfinally launched the 32-bit 80386 chip, including support for 4Gb of memory,memory management, and a 'virtual 8086' mode that would allow multiple MS-DOSapplications to run simultaneously.andM;It was 1986, though, when the 80386-based PCs arrived in the shape of the ALR386 from Advanced Logic Research and, with rather more impact, the CompaqDeskPro 386.andP;  ALR deserves credit for getting there first, but Compaq is toobig to ignore.andP;  The use of the 80386 in a single-user PC looked like a riskat the time, but ALR and Compaq's decision to slow the expansion bus downcompared with the processor, allowing existing expansion boards to workhappily while the 80386 ran software twice as fast as an 8MHz AT, made it aroaring success.andP;  Today, there's no doubt that anyone with the money to do sobuys an 80386-based machine in preference to anything else.andP;  And ALR andCompaq made that possible by taking a risk in 1986.andM;Everybody was waiting for IBM's response, and when it arrived in 1987 itmarked the end of PC history just as, according to some observers, worldhistory has ended with the collapse of Eastern Europe and the adoption ofworldwide capitalism.andM;No doubts, though, about the status of IBM's PS/2 range -- or, rather, itsMicro Channel Architecture significant in 1980s development.andP;  No doubts,either, about the unifying action of the VGA standard to settle confusion inthe colour graphics market.andM;But the final outcome will not be known for many years yet.andP;  It's possible toflag developments since 1987 as things to watch -- the obvious contenders arethe Structured Query Language (SQL) standard, driving server-baseddistributed database development; the EISA bus now arriving in systems andset to compete strongly with MCA; the delivery of a graphics-basedenvironment that can finally compete with the MAcintosh on its own terms, inthe shape of OS/2 Presentation Manager 1.2; and the unified combination ofATandamp;T Unix, Berkeley Unix, and Xenix as Unix System V.4, that promisesshrink-wrapped, graphics-based Unix applications sometime over the next fewyears.andM;But while the effects of the LaserJet or the Hayes AT command language areclear five or eightyears after the events, the 1987 watershed makes it hardto pick the winners of the 1990s.andP;  All we can do is pick the horses to watch,without betting the house and contents; any other course is too dangerous.andM;Those pundits brave enough to predict the computer of 1990 from the evidenceof 1985 got things spectacularly wrong by being too conservative and the racefor long-term significance must be viewed though hindsight-colouredbinoculars.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
