The policy cluster groups addressingthese issues plan to conduct two public hearings to solicit informationand advice. The DOT believes public comment is essential to developmentof a viable public policy. As a consequence, this notice describes somekey issues and requests a dialogue and input on issues, positions, problems,and recommended solutions for addressing the challenges facing intercitypassenger and international transportation in the 1990's and beyond. In order to stimulate a discussion of such concerns, in addition to thepublic hearings the cluster groups will be holding a series of focus groupsand site visits. Through the discussion and comments gathered from theseoutreach efforts, the Department seeks to broaden its knowledge and garnerconsensus for a national multi-modal transportation policy addressing intercitypassenger systems and international transportation. The information willbe used in formulation of a National Transportation Policy which will setforth the framework through which decisions in transportation infrastructure,services, and related needs can be systematically assessed and implementedduring the next decade and into the 21st Century.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATE:</T2> Comments must be received on or before September 1, 1989,in order to be fully considered in the development of the national transportationpolicy.

To that end,public hearings have been scheduled at which views may be expressed orally.With regard to the overall purpose of developing an integrated NationalTransportation Policy, refer to OST's notice issued on June 28, 1989 (54FR 27970); published July 3, 1989. <ITAG tagnum="84">Hearing Procedures </ITAG>(a) Attendance is opened to the interested public but limited to the spaceand time available. With the approval of the chairperson, members of thepublic may present oral statements at the hearings. (b) Persons desiring to present oral statements should notify the appropriatecluster group chairperson listed in this notice not later than July 25,1989. (c) Any person wishing to make a presentation will be asked to sign inand estimate an amount of time needed for their statement. Statements shouldbe limited to fifteen minutes. (d) The chairperson may allocate the time available for each presentationin order to accommodate all speakers. The hearing may be adjourned at anytime if all persons present have had the opportunity to speak. (e) Written material concerning the topics may be accepted at the discretionof the chairperson of each hearing. (f) The hearings will not be formally recorded. However, informal recordingswill be made of presentations to ensure that each respondent's commentsare accurately noted. Materials relating to the stated issues will be accepted at the individualmeetings. Every reasonable effort will be made to hear every request forpresentation consistent with a reasonable closing time for the hearing.<ITAG tagnum="84">Issues To Be Addressed at the Hearings </ITAG>There are a number of key issues the Intercity Passenger Service ClusterGroup must consider in assisting in the formulation of a national transportationpolicy. These include, but are not limited to, the following: 1. <T3>Roles:</T3> What should be the roles of the Federal, state, local,and private sectors in providing intercity passenger service? How shouldthey interact, coordinate, and cooperate with one another? Who should regulate,research, develop, plan, produce, operate, fund, assist, collect and disseminateinformation, or otherwise be involved in intercity passenger transportation,and in broad terms how should each be involved? 2. <T3>Preserving the infrastructure:</T3> What steps should be taken to ensureappropriate reconstruction rehabilitation, preservation, and maintenanceof the transportation infrastructure, including roadways, railways, airways,terminals, and control systems? 3. <T3>More effective, efficient transportation:</T3> What steps should betaken to gain more effective and efficient use of the intercity passengerservice and facilities available today? Possible answers include modernization,use of new technology, converting old infrastructure to new uses, providingservice to special groups, fostering better intermodal connections, improvingthe quality, timeliness, and frequency of service, managing demand, andassuring enough trained, skilled human resources to operate the transportationsystem. What economic incentives or discincentives exist or could be usedin the future to maximize efficiency in our transportation system? Howis adequacy of service measured, and when is service deemed adequate? 4. <T3>Expanding the infrastructure:</T3> What steps should be taken to expandthe infrastructure, where, and how? How should local concerns be addressed,and when if ever, should they be overridden? How can expansion of roads,rail, and air, including possible new modes such as high speed rail andtiltroter, be coordinated so that expansion does the most good possiblefor the entire national transportation system? 5. <T3>New technology:</T3> What technological innovations should be fosteredfor intercity passenger service and how? The Federal role in research anddevelopment seems an important part of the issue; what should the FederalGovernment do, if anything, to promote, fund, conduct, and apply behavioraland human factors research and to help research, design, demonstrate, build,and operate new technologies such as high speed rail, tiltrotor, new generationSSTs, smart cars and highways, and new safety devices? 6. <T3>Costs and financing:</T3> What will future programs cost, who shouldpay, and how? Are there new approaches to financing that should be used?Who subsidizes modes in the transportation system now, are there cross-subsidies,and what level of subsidy or cross subsidy should there be? How does thetax system affect transportation and the choice among modes, and shouldchanges be made in the tax incentive structure? How far should the transportationsystem move toward user charges, and what about those who may be deniedtransportation because they cannot pay? How should costs and financingdiffer for different existing modes and possible future modes such as highspeed rail? 7. <T3>Safety:</T3> How should safety issues such as aging facilities andequipment, security, and drug and alcohol abuse in transportation be addressed?How can operator safety be enhanced, given the likelihood of older operatorsand an increasingly complexity and automated transportation environment?How should the Department maintain and improve the safety of intercitypassenger transportation? What should be the appropriate level of safetyoversight, promotion, guidance, and regulation for each mode? Should theDepartment emphasize regulation, enforcement, and/or voluntary compliance,and how? 8. <T3>Environment and energy:</T3> How can the transportation system provideneeded services with less noise and pollution? How far should the Departmentgo in encouraging, providing incentives, or requiring reduced environmentalimpacts and more energy efficiency? How should the Department work withStates and localities to meet environmental concerns and encourage compatibleland use while building or improving the transportation system? The international cluster group has identified a number of broad issuesto be addressed; they include: 1. <T3>Maximizing transportation effeciency </T3>for passengers and shippersfor the purpose of fostering a more competitive economy; facilitating internationaltransportation of passengers and freight;<ITAG tagnum="15">_How can the U.S. Government encourage U.S. flag and other carriersand port authorities to operate efficiently?
