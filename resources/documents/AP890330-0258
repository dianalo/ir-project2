Subroto, secretary-general of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries, said the meeting of the cartel's eight-membermonitoring committee was held in a ``very frank, good atmosphere''but declined to provide details.   The ministers, he said, renewed their intention to ``adhere verystrictly'' in the April-June quarter to last November's agreementthat called for production curbs in order to raise sagging crudeprices.   Prices since then have risen by more than $5 a barrel for OPECcrudes and before the meetings there were indications someministers wanted to consider raising the production limit for thesecond half of 1989 to keep prices from rising too sharply.   Iraq's oil minister Issam Abdul Raheem Al-Chalabi, when asked byreporters if he expected OPEC to raise its output limits, said``Well, this is one of the proposals that has been put forward.''He declined to elaborate.   The meeting was the organization's first formal review of theoil market since the accord, which covers the first six months ofthe year.   The supply cuts _ combined with greater demand and accidents inproducing areas _ have driven the price of a basket of OPEC crudesto the cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.   In futures trading, the May contract for West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude, closed up 61 cents Thursdayat $20.81 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. That levelis more than $7 higher than the two-year lows reached last October.   Crude prices were boosted somewhat Thursday by indications therecould be further supply problems stemming from the major oil spillat Valdez, Alaska.   Analysts say most of the 13 OPEC nations have curtailedproduction to try to meet the cartel's daily output cap of 18.5million barrels in the first six months of the year.   The key violator, analysts say, has been the United ArabEmirates.   But Subroto announced that Abu Dhabi, which accounts for abouttwo-thirds of UAE production, planned to limit output to 850,000barrels a day in March. It has been producing an estimated 1million barrels daily, compared with its quota of 988,000 barrels.   The promise, he said, ``is a good sign of the willingness ofeverybody to adhere to the agreement.''   OPEC says 12 nations supplied 17.4 million barrels of oil a dayto the world market in February, compared with the ceiling of 17.51million barrels for the dozen.   The United Arab Emirates was not included because it did notsupply figures to the cartel.   Subroto said the ministers discussed a variety of topicscovering short-term and long-term issues confronting the oil market.   This weeks talks laid groundwork for OPEC's June meeting, whenministers will discuss an accord for the second half of this year.   Kuwait's oil minister, Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah, suggested ina recent interview that the cartel should boost its production cap1.5 million barrels a day to a total of 20 million barrels in thelast six months of the year.   But other ministers have said they wanted to see how pricesperform in the second quarter, normally weaker than theJanuary-March period with the coming of warmer weather in oilimporting nations.   Subroto said, ``Demand for oil in the second half (of 1989) willbe increasing.''   Subroto said the ministers would have ``many contacts with eachother'' before June, but he said there was no decision to convenethe monitoring committee before then.   Before Thursday's formal talks, the ministers met privately intheir rooms at a luxury hotel.   Independent oil exporting nations have agreed to help OPEC inthe second quarter by snipping their exports a total of about300,000 barrels a day.   Members of the monitoring committee are Algeria, Indonesia,Iran, Iraq, Kuwait, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela.   Other OPEC members are Ecuador, Gabon, Libya, Qatar and theUnited Arab Emirates.</TEXT></DOC>
