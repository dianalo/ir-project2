(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A lawyer for John Zaccaro Jr. admittedFriday that his client sold cocaine, but said the son of formervice presidential candidate Geraldine Ferraro was tricked intomaking the sale by an attractive female officer.   Zaccaro is on trial in Vermont District Court on allegations heillegally sold a quarter-gram of cocaine to the undercover officertwo years ago. The charge carries a maximum penalty of five yearsin prison and a $5,000 fine.   ``The defense will not dispute the allegation that he sold aregulated drug,'' said Charles Tetzlaff in his opening statementFriday. ``This is a case of improper and overzealous policeconduct.''   Tetzlaff said ``an attractive female police officer'' who hadnever before acted on an undercover assignment entrapped Zaccarointo making the sale. He said it was the woman, not Zaccaro, whobrought up the subject of buying drugs.   When she took the stand Friday, the officer, Laura Manning, wasasked what she said to Zaccaro when she came to his off-campusapartment in February 1986. ``I said, `A couple of people told methat you could sell me some coke.'''   ``And what did he say?'' asked Addison County Prosecutor JohnQuinn.   ``Sure,'' Manning quoted Zaccaro as responding. She added, ``Hepulled a tray from under the couch.''   Manning testified that the tray had on it about 15 packets ofcocaine in a plastic bag, with the packets marked by weight.   When questioned by Tetzlaff on her apparel that day, Manningsaid she was told to dress like a college student, and was wearingan open jean jacket, a yellow V-neck sweater and jeans.   She said she was hesitant to take the assignment because she hadnever done an undercover job. She said she was given instructionson what to wear and what to say.   ``Did they tell you to ask for cocaine?'' Tetzlaff asked her.   ``Yes,'' replied Manning.   After Manning's testimony, the trial was adjourned untilSaturday.   Quinn conceded in his opening argument that Manning wasinexperienced, but asked jurors to keep in mind that the MiddleburyPolice Department is a low-budget, small-town operation.   ``We don't have huge resources in the state,'' he said, addingit was even difficult for police to come up with $30 for thepurchase.   The prosecutor painted a picture of Zaccaro as a well-organizeddrug dealer.   He said that when Manning asked to buy cocaine, Zaccaro pulled atray from under his couch with 15 packets of the drug. ``When hetakes a packet off the tray, he opens it up, being the goodmerchant that he is ... looks at it, wraps it up'' and gives it toManning, Quinn said.   Quinn also said a detective began investigating Zaccaro after anote was left on his desk with Zaccaro's name, address, carregistration and the words ``The Pharmacist.''   Prosecutors and police have said Zaccaro was known at MiddleburyCollege as ``the pharmacist'' because of his reputation as a drugdealer.   The detective, David Wemette, was the first witness. Hetestified he had first heard rumors of Zaccaro's drug dealing in1984, but that he did not pursue them because Zaccaro left to helphis mother's campaign.   Manning's drug buy came Feb. 20, 1986, at Zaccaro's off-campusapartment. Zaccaro was arrested a few days later after policesearched his car and apartment.   Opening arguments followed four days of jury selection, a taskslowed by wide publicity. Ferraro and her husband, John ZaccaroSr., have been sitting side by side behind their son in court.   The jury is being sequestered to help ensure they avoid pressaccounts of the trial.</TEXT></DOC>
