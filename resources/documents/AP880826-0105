Botha was greetedby a black choir singing his praises today as he toured ashantytown his government tried several times to destroy.   Botha, making one of his few visits to a black township in his10 years as head of state, was cheered loudly when he arrived atthe long-troubled Crossroads area outside Cape Town.   ``Thank you, we accept you as our leader,'' a choir sang in theXhosa language.   After years of trying to eliminate the squatters' town, Botha'sgovernment is now building new houses in Crossroads.   However, the population has changed. Most of the current 120,000residents are believed supporters of the vigilantes who in 1986burned down huge areas of Crossroads where anti-apartheid activistsheld sway. Scores of people were killed and 70,000 squatters burnedout of their homes during that factional fighting.   Botha stopped at a new job-training center where the appointedmayor, Johnson Ngxobongwana, welcomed him ``in the name of allCrossroads residents.''   Ngxobongwana headed the so-called vigilantes.   Many of his displaced opponents have moved where the governmentwanted them _ a massive township called Khayelitsha, further fromCape Town.   Botha, accompanied by his wife, Elize, and daughter, Rozanne,concluded his visit with a half-hour drive past Crossroads shacksand an area where new homes are being built. Several thousandresidents looked on, many cheering, and youths ran after his carwhen it left a child-care center.   At one point, Botha inspected a house under construction, andspread mortar with a trowel. Later, he shook the hand of a boy whoran alongside his car.   Jan van Eck, an anti-apartheid member of Parliament, said ofCrossroads, ``The black community that rejects an Archbishop(Desmond) Tutu and accepts into its midst the oppressor, Mr. P.W.Botha, is far removed from the rest of the oppressed people ofSouth Africa.''   He was referring to graffiti on a wall near the main entrance toCrossroads that says: ``No entry for Tutu'' _ the black Anglicanleader who won the 1984 Nobel Peace Prize for his fight againstapartheid, under which the black majority has no voice in nationalaffairs.   Crossroads was declared a township last year _ the first timeits residents were not classified as squatters. Millions of blackslive in squatter camps elsewhere in South Africa, and thegovernment has introduced legislation making it easier forauthorities to evict them.   Botha said the employment center was an example of hisgovernment's attempts to develop black areas.   ``To boycott is easy, but it leads nowhere,'' Botha told about200 people in the center. ``To cooperate is sometimes difficult andto take responsibility sometimes difficult. But history remembersonly those who build, not those who destroy.''   The center is used to train unemployed people in carpentry,bricklaying, sewing and other skills.   The shantytown's troubled history centers around thewhite-dominated government's former policy that people ofmixed-race had preference over blacks for all jobs in the Cape Townregion and that blacks lived there only as temporary workers.   Crossroads was born as a result of the government's attempt toremove several ``black spots,'' where blacks lived illegally.   When three such areas were demolished in 1974, residents packedtheir few possessions and moved, but only as far as an intersectionnear Cape Town's airport.   By 1976, Crossroads was a squatter city of 60,000 people, andthe government declared it an ``emergency camp.'' Subsequentdemolitions and evictions failed to stem its growth.   In 1984, Botha abandoned the idea that the Cape should be ajob-preference area for mixed-race people and promised a halt toforced removals for race separation purposes.   By 1986, an estimated 200,000 blacks were living in Crossroads'slums when battles broke out between different neighborhoods.Residents and community workers said police aided militants fromthe oldest section of Crossroads who burned down neighborhoodswhere anti-apartheid activists lived.   The Cape Town Supreme Court is hearing the first of at least3,000 damage suits by those who lost their homes. They charge thepolice and government with responsibilty.</TEXT></DOC>
