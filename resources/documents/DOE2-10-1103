The electroopticalsystem is sinthesized from electron beam parameters in the cavity regionand the electrodynamical system includes a conventional resonator consistingof truncated cones. The starting and operating characteristics are calculatedby integrating the exact equation of electron motion under de actionof an RF field with fixed spatial distribution. The experimental activitiesare concentrated on the construction of a system of magnetic coils, ableto generate a 15 KG magnetic induction with a fluctuation of 0.1% overan extension of 13 cm; the manufacture of caerties by using electroformingtechniques; and the development of techiques for the construction ofelectron guns.</TEXT></DOC>
