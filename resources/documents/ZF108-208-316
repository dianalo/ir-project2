 -- It's not a workstation, Apple says, but the &quot;wicked-fastMacintosh&quot; the company plans to introduce this month for the first timebrings workstation levels of raw power to the Mac family.andM;According to technical documentation recently examined by MacWEEK, the IIfxincorporates an innovative architecture designed to deliver optimalperformance from the whole system, not just impressive benchmarks.andM;A custom Apple chip coordinates a sophisticated memory-access andmemory-caching system supporting the machine's 40-MHz 68030 processor, whileother dedicated processors offload I/O management from the CPU, eliminatingbottlenecks that have limited the performance of previous Macs.andM;Although the new Mac's logic board will fit in the Mac II/IIx case, Apple&quot;had to re-engineer every aspect of the system to provide balance&quot; for itshigh-speed processor.andM;The result of that effort, according to the documents, was &quot;the most highlyintegrated design&quot; Apple has ever delivered.andM;The IIfx's circuitry is divided into two logical subsections:andM;andgt;On the &quot;processor side&quot; of the IIfx system, the 68030, a built-in 32-Kbytestatic RAM cache, redesigned memory modules, new memory-access techniques andthe memory-controller chip work together to achieve zero-wait-stateperformance most of the time.andM;When the 68030 looks for data, it first checks its own internal 256-bytecache.andP;  If the data is not there, the processor turns to the SRAM cache,which operates at 25 nanoseconds -- fast enough to permit the processor toextract information in a single clock cycle (zero wait states).andM;Only if the required data isn't in either cache does the system have to loadit from RAM or ROM, which takes up to six clock cycles.andP;  But more than 90percent of the time, according to the Apple documents, data will be availablefrom the SRAM cache.andM;Central to the system's performance is the Fast Memory Controller (FMC), theApple-designed chip that manages all processor-memory interaction.andP;  The FMCenables the 68030 to read RAM and ROM and to write to RAM in burst mode -- atechnique that effectively cuts in half the number of clock cycles requiredfor sustained memory access.andP;  The Mac IIci, the soon-to-be-dethroned speedchampion of the Mac family, supports burst reads but not writes.andM;The FMC uses a technique called &quot;latched writes&quot; to make zero-wait-statememory writes possible.andP;  When the processor issues a write, the memorycontroller stores the data in a temporary location (the latch) and tells theCPU the write has finished, leaving the processor free to perform the nextinstruction.andP;  The memory controller then takes the data and performs a normalwrite operation.andP;  The IIfx's SIMMs (single in-line memory modules) provideextra pins so data can be entering and leaving the SIMMs at the same time.andM;andgt;The I/O section of the Mac IIfx board includes a standard 10-MHz NuBusinterface supporting six slots; a single processor-direct slot; the AppleSound Chip; a Motorola 68882 floating-point coprocessor; and controllers forSCSI, the Apple Desktop Bus, floppy drives and the two serial ports.andM;The Apple integrated circuit that manages the SCSI bus brings DMA -- directmemory access, or transfer of data between external devices and RAM, withminimal intervention of the central processor -- to the Mac line for thefirst time.andM;Another new chip called the I/O Processor (IOP), incorporating a 6502microprocessor and a 32-Kbyte buffer, is designed to provide intelligentsupport for the circuits that directly control other I/O channels.andM;IOPs are installed in two places on the board: One relieves the 68030 offloppy disk and ADB chores, while the other, linked to the Mac's serialcommunications controller, processes LocalTalk packets and interrupts andother input from the modem and printer ports.andM;The serial-port IOP will enable the serial controller to keep up with a56-Kbps data stream, which is four times what any previous Mac could handlewithout periodically having to tell the sending device to wait.andP;  Thefloppy/ADB processor will bring significant performance improvements underA/UX, the Apple documents say, but only modest benefits on machines runningeven the latest versions of the current Mac operating system.andM;With the exception of the math chip, which matches the 68030's 40-MHz clockspeed, the entire I/O side of the system runs at 20 MHz.andP;  When the CPUaccesses any device on the I/O side of the board, the FMC temporarily cutsthe CPU's clock speed in half.andP;  The object of this technique, according tothe documents, is to avoid inserting processor wait states that would degradeoverall performance by holding the whole system hostage to slower I/Odevices.andM;The processor-direct slot, comparable to but not compatible with the SE/30's,will offer card developers access to the CPU at twice NuBus speeds.andM;Some of the Mac IIfx's features -- SCSI DMA and the I/O processors inparticular -- are used to only a limited extent by System 6.0.5, the Appledocuments say.andP;  Taking full advantage of them requires a pre-emptivemultiprocessing environment, such as A/UX or, no doubt, future versions ofthe Mac operating system.andP;  But the hardware described in the Apple documentsleaves no room for doubt: The IIfx moves the Mac into the fast lane.andM;While the real breakthrough in the Mac IIfx is a motherboard designed forfull-bore performance, specifications for the new machine indicate thatbuyers also will benefit from a variety of other improvements in Apple'ssix-slot design.andM;andgt;The new machine is quieter, according to Apple documents, because its largerfan can move more air while spinning at slower speeds.andP;  In addition, theIIfx's 230-watt power supply -- the same capacity as in the Mac II and IIx --will have a variable-speed fan controller that senses the temperature insidethe case, speeding or slowing the fan as required.andM;andgt;The case cover has been modified to eliminate the cracking noise the olddesign produced when the case was opened -- a sound that reportedly convincedmany nervous Mac II buyers that they had already damaged their expensive newmachines.andP;  The case cover also will be fitted with brackets to hold NuBuscards in place from above, making it possible to ship the machines with cardsinstalled.andM;The quieter power supply and new case cover will be incorporated into the MacIIx as well as the IIfx, but will not be part of the upgrade Apple will offerowners of the older six-slot machines.andP;  -- By Henry NorrandM;As usual, a new Mac means a new system.andP;  The Mac IIfx and Apple's new familyof display cards will require System 6.0.5, which will be rolled out on March19 with the hardware.andM;The update is a general release designed for all current Macs, according toApple documents.andP;  They detail scores of bugs fixed in the new release, aswell as several new features that will be easily visible to end users:andM;andgt;Because the speed of recent Macintoshes has made scrolling through ControlPanel icons and standard file dialogs difficult, System 6.0.5 will slowscrolling to a more manageable pace.andM;andgt;The Installer will get animated graphics and other enhancements.andM;andgt;32-bit QuickDraw will be updated.andP;  Version 1.2, reportedly 8 Kbytes smallerthan the original, will work only with System 6.0.5.andM;andgt;16- and 32-bit color icons are now supported by the system.andP;  -- By HenryNorr</TEXT></DOC>
