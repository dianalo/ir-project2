Three years after outstripping Prime Minister Margaret Thatcherin opinion polls and promising to break the mold of Britishpolitics, the two center parties have been shunted to the sidelines.   Britain once again appears to be a two-party state _ thegoverning Conservatives, who are to meet Oct. 11-14, and theopposition Labor Party, whose convention is Oct. 2-7.   The Social Democratic Party, led David Owen, who is often ratedthe most formidable politician in Britain after Mrs. Thatcher,ended its four-day convention Tuesday just barely alive.   The newly-formed Social and Liberal Democratic Party is not inmuch better condition before its meeting Sept. 24-29 in the seasideresort of Blackpool.   The party, a merger of Social Democrats and Liberals, oncelooked like it could turn British politics into a three-way race.The alliance polled 22.5 percent of the vote in the last generalelection in June 1987.   Today, the two parties are fighting their political battlesseparately and can't reach even double digits in popular support.Recent polls show only 9 percent support for the Social and LiberalDemocrats and 4 percent for the Social Democrats.   The former political allies have become victims of unkind jokesand public indifference. Most analysts believe their mainsignificance lies in their capacity to snatch just enough votesfrom Labor to ensure Mrs. Thatcher an unprecedented fourthconsecutive term in the next election.   The Social Democratic Party has only three members inParliament. Except for Owen, a national figure with a big followingin his district of Plymouth, the legislators may well lose theirseats in the next elections.   ``Perhaps (Owen will) reflect ... on the hopes thrown away andthe opportunities bungled,'' lamented the liberal Guardiannewspaper.   Owen, 50, the former foreign secretary once tipped for thepremiership, rallied only a handful of loyalists to debateapartheid, nuclear weapons and British shopping hours at the partyconvention this week in Torquay, a south England coastal resort.   Three years ago the British Broadcasting Corp. gave Owens' partyconference full and live television coverage, just like theConservative, Labor and Liberal party conferences. The atmospherewas heady.   This year, the trappings remained _ cameras, reporters, agendas,resolutions _ but the BBC covered less than half the proceedingsand delayed screening Owen's keynote address because it clashedwith the Olympics.   ``(The centrist parties) don't speak to a clear constituency andtheir support has generally been negative _ from people who don'tlike the Tories or don't like Labor rather than having any clearperception of what the center's policies are,'' political analystPeter Keliner said in an interview.   In most other West European countries, center parties thrive,often in coalition governments under electoral systems thatallocate parliamentary seats according to the percentage of thevote won. In Britain, a legislator wins only when he wins hisdistrict.   ``Fundamentally, the British electoral system operates againstcenter parties,'' Kellner said.   Owen appealed in vain to the Labor Party for a new voting systemless harsh on small parties.   ``Does the Labor Party go on vainly pretending that they canchallenge and beat the Conservatives outright?'' he asked.   The Social and Liberal Democratic Party controls 19 seats in the650-member House of Commons, compared with the Conservatives' 374and Labor's 228.   The experiment in centrist politics began in 1981, whendisenchanted Laborites broke away to form the Social DemocraticParty. The same year, the new party formed an alliance with theLiberals, a party started in 1828 that once governed the countrybut was reduced to a minority.   In the 1983 election, the two-party alliance made an impressivedebut, capturing one-fourth of the vote. Four years later, itsshare of the vote fell. The alliance promptly split after itsLiberal co-leader, David Steel, demanded a formal merger, arguingthat a two-headed party had no chance.   The merger, which resulted in the Social and Liberal DemocraticParty, was finalized in March 1988 after months of politicalinfighting.   Owen has remained with what is left of the original SocialDemocratic Party and Steel retired and was succeeded by PaddyAshdown, a Liberal legislator.   ``Today, as a result, we see Dr. Owen, a leader without a partyworth the name (and) the Social and Liberal Democrats, a partydevoid of leaders worth the name,'' commented Peter Jenkins,columnist in the London newspaper, the Independent.</TEXT></DOC>
