It's unfair tostereotype all Arabs,'' said Jawad F. George, executive director ofthe National Association of Arab Americans. ``Arabs are replacingthe Soviet Union as the enemy of the United States.''   In San Francisco, a professor received a death threat aftertelling a newspaper he favored a negotiated settlement to thecrisis. An Arab-American newspaper editor in Detroit was told in aphone call he would be killed if any Americans were hurt in Kuwait.   Cleveland police shouted ethnic slurs at an Egyptian grocer andjailed him for a night after a minor dispute with youngsters in hisneighborhood. A young Palestinian walking in a Chicago supermarketwith his mother was hit and told to go back to Iraq.   The Los Angeles office of the Arab-American Anti-DiscriminationCommittee received obscene phone calls.   ``Whenever there is a crisis in the Middle East, theArab-American becomes a scapegoat,'' said Albert Mokhiber, thecommittee's director of legal services.   Mokhiber said the 1985 terrorist attack on the cruise shipAchille Lauro that led to the death of an American passenger wasfollowed by the letter-bomb murder of prominent Arab-American AlexOdeh.   Mosques were attacked after the 1985 hijacking of a TWA aircraftto Beirut. Bricks were thrown through the windows ofIranian-Americans during the hostage siege in Tehran.   ``The potential (for trouble) may be far worse in this case thananything we've ever seen,'' Mokhiber said. ``The entire Arabcommunity is going to be vilified.''   He and other Arab-American leaders said America's 2.5 millionpeople of Arab descent already are being negatively linked to Iraq.Only 150,000 Arab-Americans are of Iraqi origins, and many of thoseare refugees from persecution in their homeland.   ``There's obviously a potential for tarring all Arabs with onebrush,'' said Ann Joyce of the American-Arab Affairs Council.``Anyone in the field sees this as a disaster.''   Arab-Americans say TV comedians, radio talk shows and politicalcartoonists are creating an anti-Arab hysteria by depicting``Ay-rabs'' as ugly, hook-nosed, burnoose-draped sheiks orterrorists. They are referred to as ``camel jockeys'' or``sandblowers.''   One Georgia radio station sponsored a ``towel head'' contest.Other stations are promoting songs with anti-Arab lyrics.   Jim Zogby, president of the Arab-American Institute, said Arabshave always been depicted in movies as sinister and lacking inhumanity.   ``People don't know who we are,'' he said. ``It's terriblytroubling to our community.''   Khalil Barhoum of the San Francisco chapter of theAnti-Discrimination Committee said threatening phone calls receivedby Bay area Arab-Americans ``made them realize there's a lot ofbigotry. We're all Americans and we should have a right to voiceour opinions.''   But many Arab-Americans are apparently choosing to muffle evenmoderate opinions until the crisis subsides.   ``There's a feeling of vulnerability, a dread fear that ifshooting begins what is sitting under the surface will rear itshead rather vehemently,'' Zogby said.   Detroit, home to America's largest Arab-American community of250,000, has escaped major confrontations thus far.   ``But there's tension and paranoia and fear,'' said Sam Baraka,a Palestinian doctor and official of Detroit's Arab ChaldeanCouncil.   ``It's very inflammable here and people don't want to speak,''he said.   ``Enough is enough, we are American citizens,'' said oneWashington, D.C., Arab-American woman who declined to give her name.   ``We don't need to be maligned. People say `go back where youcame from,' but we came from here.''</TEXT></DOC>
