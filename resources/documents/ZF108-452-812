 2, No.andO;11), the company's flagship software product was 3+, a network operatingsystem that ran on PCs and on 3Com's proprietary servers.andP;  SupportingMacintoshes (using a fast, proprietary protocol), e-mail, routing and remotedial-in, along with the usual file and print services, 3+ providesindustrial-strength network computing tools that are well suited for runningan office, particularly one with PCs and Macs intermixed.andP;  In fact, we havebeen using it in our West Coast office to run our Seminars business sincelate 1987.andM;3+ does have its shortcomings, however, particularly for operating in apublishing environment.andP;  Although its integrated suite of value addedservices (built on top of Microsoft's DOS-based MS-NET LAN software) providemany of the features required in a workgroup publishing solution, its memoryconsumption (120K in a typical netstation configuration) and its lack ofnetwork management tools comparable to those in Novell's NetWare (see Vol.andO;3, No.andP;  12) make it a less-than-optimum choice for PC-based publishingsystems.andP;  In fact, many publishing vendors, such as Bestinfo, havestandardized on NetWare to the exclusion of 3Com's 3+ and other LAN operatingsystems.andM;Upping the ante.andP;  In this article we take a look at 3Com's next-generationnetwork operating system, 3+Open.andP;  Based on OS/2 LAN Manager, which 3Comco-developed with Microsoft, 3+Open is a multitasking network operatingsystem that is tightly wedded to OS/2.andP;  It provides a rich environment forapplication developers wanting to provide server-based applications that takeadvantage of OS/2's preemptive scheduler, named pipes protocol, andmulti-threaded processes.andM;Targeted squarely at Novell's market-leading NetWare operating system, 3+Openpromises to give Novell a serious run for its money.andP;  Indeed, fear of OS/2LAN Manager's increasing influence in the market, and particularly forclient-server applications using Microsoft's SQL Server relational databasesoftware, was undoubtedly one of the factors influencing Novell's decision tomerge with Lotus (see related story in The Latest Word in this issue).andM;We have been running 3+Open in our Malibu office in one form or another sinceit was released in mid-1988.andP;  We experimented with 3+Open 1.0, but didn'tmake any attempt to integrate it into our office operations.andP;  But beginningin August 1989, when we received 3+Open 1.1, we have been running 3+Opennon-stop on 3Com's new 20-MHz '386-based server, the 3S/521, which has a320-MB hard disk and 16 MB of RAM.andM;However, it wasn't until we received an early beta-test version of 3Com's3+Open Macintosh server software that we began this review.andP;  One of ourcriteria for this series of &quot;hands-on&quot; networking articles is that thenetwork in question must support both PCs and Macs in our offices.andM;Just the beginning?andP;  LAN Manager provides a wide variety of benefits: SQLServer and Macintosh support, multiple protocol stacks (including NetWare'sIPX and one, NBP, that requires only 50 KB of DOS memory), improved networkmanagement tools, up to 16 MB of addressable memory, enhanced connectivityand gateway options.andP;  To these, 3Com has added 3+Open versions of 3Com'sexcellent value-added services, such as 3+Mail, Backup, diskless workstationsupport, and a global naming service.andM;But we are still left with the impression that 3+Open 1.1 is, in oneanalyst's words, &quot;only a starting point for OS/2 LANs.&quot;andP;  Indeed, shortlybefore 3+Open 1.1 was shipped, Novell announced NetWare 386, which takes fulladvantage of the i386 architecture and is allegedly 200-300% faster thanNetWare 286, whose performance is roughly comparable to that of 3+Open 1.1.andM;Lurking just over the horizon, however, is a new release of LAN Manager,version 2.0, which promises to equal or exceed NetWare 386's feature list.andO;It will use Microsoft's new High-Performance File system (HPFS) and willsport multi-processing hooks, improved security features, and more efficientuse of DOS memory in client workstations by using the jetheui protocol stack.andO;(3Com's NBP protocol already provides faster performance that jetheui,however, and is 10K smaller).andP;  LAN Manager 2.0, when incorporated into 3Com's3+Open product line, should make 3Com a real contender in the LANsweepstakes.andM;Organization of this article.andP;  3+Open Macintosh will be released as thisarticle goes to press.andP;  Consequently, our review was based on late-beta AFPServer code, which had not yet been optimized for performance.andP;  Neverthelesswe believe we have a reasonably accurate picture of what the full 3+Open 1.1product suite has to offer an operation of our size and scope.andP;  As in ourother articles in this series, we will report our impressions of using 3+Openin the latter half of this article.andM;But we recognize that we haven't had the opportunity to use 3+Open inday-to-day publishing operations, nor have we taken full advantage of theclient-server paradigm that is one of the most powerful features provided by3Com's 3+Open network operating system.andP;  Consequently, we conclude thisarticle with a case study of an innovative legal word processing and documentmanagement system that was constructed for the Seattle-based law firm ofPerkins Cole by Gilbert andamp; Associates, a Pacific Palisades, California-basedsystems consultant.andP;  Built around 3+Open, Saros FileShare, and Microsoft Wordfor Windows, the system is a harbinger of the great things to come as theindustry moves onto next-generation network computing tools such as 3+Open.andM;3Com's client-server strategyandM;3Com and Microsoft announced their joint development agreement for OS/2 LANManager in June 1987 (see Vol.andP;  1, No.andP;  11).andP;  The agreement called for 3Comto develop the network protocols (Ethernet and Token Ring) and the networkingadd-in cards for computers and to market the product on a retail level, whileMicrosoft concentrated on developing the system level software.andP;  Microsoftalso had the right to license LAN Manager software to other OEMs, which itpromptly did: to DEC, HP, Compaq and others.andM;System supplier.andP;  Previously, 3Com had made its reputation as a manufacturerof (mostly Ethernet) LAN hardware and as a developer of network protocols andvalue-added services (such as e-mail and Macintosh support) for MS-NET(Microsoft) DOS-based networks.andM;With the LAN Manager development deal, 3Com put paid to its relationship withNovell.andP;  Previously, 3Com had focused on the hardware side of LANs, andNovell on the software side.andP;  The divorce caused both companies to escalatetheir encroachment on each other's turf.andP;  3Com continued to evolve itsMS-NET-based 3+ network operating system and marketed it actively while LANManager was in the oven, making it a top second-tier contender behindNovell's NetWare.andP;  Novell entered the hardware business, developing its ownnetwork adapters and servers.andM;Both companies moved to position themselves as system suppliers, competingagainst traditional minicomputer- and workstation-based workgroup systems.andM;3+Open 1.0.andP;  Microsoft released LAN Manager 1.0 to OEMs in October 1988, with3Com's version, 3+Open 1.0, following shortly thereafter.andP;  3Com was able tobe the first LAN Manager OEM into the market by virtue of its workingrelationship with Microsoft.andM;3+Open 1.0 consisted of an OS/2-based server component, running a3Com-enhanced version of LAN Manager 1.0.andP;  It supported both OS/2 and DOSclient workstations, offering file/print services, SQL Server support, andlittle else.andP;  A DOS client was able to perform most of the user functionsthat an OS/2 client could perform, but few of the administrative functions,most of which ran only on an OS/2 client.andM;However, 3Com's first release lacked most of the value-added services forwhich its 3+ operating system was renowned, including automatic backup,e-mail, Macintosh support and the rest.andP;  (Most were available by the timeversion 1.1 was released.)andP;  Nor did the first version support 3Com'sproprietary servers.andM;Needless to say, 3+Open 1.0 did not give Novell anything like a run for itsmoney in the marketplace.andP;  Even today, 3+Open and LAN Manager have only begunto show up on network operating system sales charts.andP;  Initially, this waspartly due to the lack of LAN Manager applications--a problem that hasplagued OS/2 in general--as well as the lack of understanding by the marketas to the benefits of LAN Manager over Novell's NetWare.andM;LAN Wars.andP;  Microsoft and 3Com went on the offensive, attacking Novell forbeing &quot;proprietary&quot; and extolling the benefits of building a networkoperating system on top of an &quot;open,&quot; industry &quot;standard&quot; operatingenvironment such as OS/2.andP;  To this day, Novell has been fighting an uphillbattle against the &quot;proprietary&quot; charge leveled at it by Microsoft and 3Com.andM;(This issue of which network operating system is proprietary and which isn'tdepends largely on whether you buy Novell's argument that it is a standard byvirtue of its market share, or are convinced that OS/2 will eventuallydominate the desktop and therefore become the standard.andP;  We can see Novell'sargument in the short run, but are also convinced that OS/2 will in the endwin the larger share of the desktop.andP;  Developers, who have to make theirchoices early in the game, will play with whatever APIs they feel will givethem the largest market opportunity in the future.andP;  So far, Novell andMicrosoft seem to be running neck and neck in the battle of the APIs.andP;  TheLotus/Novell merger, however, might give an indication of how Novell feelsabout its ultimate chance of competing against Microsoft's APIs alone.)andM;For its part Microsoft announced SQL Server, which is a SQL relationaldatabase engine, developed in conjunction with Sybase and Ashton-Tate, thatruns in the server itself.andP;  It also announced agreements with HP, to port LANManager's API set to Unix, and DCA, to develop a Communications Serverequivalent to that portion of IBM's OS/2 Extended Edition.andM;(IBM's LAN Server, although sharing a common code base with LAN Manager, hasuntil now not been 100% compatible with the latter.andP;  However, IBM has seenthe error of its ways, and announced at last Fall's Comdex that it willconverge LAN Server with LAN Manager over time.)andM;3Com, on the other hand, focused on its announced plans to support multipleprotocol stacks and to provide software gateways to IBM SNA, X.400 mailservices, X.25 WANs, DEC, and OSI environments, as well as to port most ofthe 3+ value-added service suite to 3+Open.andP;  (For a complete listing of all3+Open products and services, see the accompanying box).andM;We don't have space for a blow-by-blow account of the war for the hearts andminds of the trade press fought between 3Com/Microsoft and Novell since therelease of LAN Manager.andP;  We have covered much of this struggle in these pagesover the past two years.andP;  Suffice it to say that although Novell was winningthe battles in the market, it has found itself on the defensive due to itswaffling on the issue of how it would support the OS/2 named pipes interface,which is necessary to access SQL Server, among other things.andM;Client-server computing.andP;  SQL Server introduced the concept of client-servercomputing to the desktop market.andP;  Client-server systems divide applicationmanagement, computation and presentation of data among those network devicesbest suited to the tasks, from desktop workstations to servers tominicomputers and mainframes, delivering faster response times and higheroverall system performance than available from traditional file sharingsystems.andP;  As such it represents a new paradigm for desktop computing, onewith its antecedents in the workstation and minicomputer world.andM;Typically on a client-server system, processing of SQL database searches andother computation-intensive applications take place on the server.andP;  Theworkstation (client) translates user input into requests that are transmittedtransparently to the server (or servers) on the net, and formats serverresponses for display on the workstation.andM;In contrast, first-generation network systems (like 3+ and NetWare 286)require application processing by desktop computers while the network serverhandles the data sharing and storage only.andM;3+Open 1.1.andP;  The client-server concept represents the most clearly delineatedbenefit offered by LAN Manager over NetWare 286, and consequently has beenthe major factor behind most of the early design wins that 3Com has had with3+Open.andP;  Many of the early adopters are Fortune 500 companies seeking tomigrate traditional mainframe and minicomputer-based transaction processingoperations to distributed, networked PC servers and workstations.andM;With the release of 3+Open 1.1 in August 1989, 3Com formally repositioneditself as a full-complement system supplier, and jumped squarely on board theclient-server bandwagon to boot.andP;  3+Open was introduced with several systemconfigurations based on 3Com's new server, the 3S/500 series, as well asseveral new i286-based diskless workstation products.andP;  (See Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  2,pp.andP;  35-36 for a full account of these announcements and pricing.)andM;With the release of 3+Open 1.1, 3Com introduced several new features tofacilitate the handling of multiple protocols and expand the available memoryin DOS workstations, including:andM;* NetBIOS Protocol (NBP), which is 3Com's proprietary implementation ofMicrosoft's NetBIOS.andP;  NBP has been optimized for minimum memory consumptionand maximum performance.andP;  The protocol stack itself is only 25 KB in size.andO;Although this isn't important in OS/2 netstation configurations, DOSnetstations need every extra byte of memory they can get.andP;  The importance ofthis cannot be overrated--a large part of NetWare's market success was due toits parsimonious use of DOS memory space.andM;* Demand Protocol Architecture (DPA), which enables protocol stacks to bedynamically loaded and unloaded on DOS workstations on the fly (on OS/2workstations both are loaded concurrently).andP;  When 3+Open 1.1 shipped, 3Comoffered DPA support for XNS and NBP only, but TCP/IP and NetWare's IPX havebeen added since.andM;Since the XNS protocol is required for running 3+Open Mail and for managing3+ networks in a mixed 3+Open/3+ system, DPA allows XNS to be demand-loadedinto the workstation whenever one of these services is evoked.andP;  For example,a user will run NBP for intranetworking applications such as file and print,and demand-load XNS for internetworking applications such as 3+Open Mail.andO;When the secondary protocol is no longer required, it is unloaded.andM;Currently, DPA is a client-side strategy, but ultimately 3Com intends toimplement it on the server side as well.andP;  This will make many managementfunctions available without bringing down the server.andP;  3Com uses the NetworkDevice Interface (NDIS) driver specification it co-developed with Microsofton both the client and server sides.andP;  NDIS has been adopted by IBM, DEC, andHP, among others.andP;  Once DPA is fully implemented, NDIS drivers will allowmultiple protocols to share a single network adapter.andP;  From the networkinterface vendor's viewpoint, support of NDIS will ensure that their boardscan be used with any available network protocol.andM;According to 3Com, DPA, along with SQL Server-based applications, have bothbeen responsible for an upsurge in 3+Open sales in recent months.andM;The NetWare connection.andP;  In recent months Microsoft appears to have backedaway from its strategic partnership with 3Com, perhaps due to thedisappointing sales of LAN Manager to date.andP;  It pre-announced LAN Manager 2.0in conjunction with Compaq in November 1989, and now has announced that itwill begin direct selling of LAN Manager--in competition with its OEMs.andP;  (Seerelated story in our last issue, Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  8, p. 40.)andM;3Com has responded by repositioning itself as an enterprise-wide systemintegrator, focusing on the value-added services requested by its customers,and leaving LAN Manager development (and debugging) up to Microsoft.andO;Consequently 3Com's next release of 3+Open, due sometime this fall, will belargely a no-frills repackaging of Microsoft's LAN Manager 2.0.andP;  Microsoft'sversion of LAN Manager is a spartan file and print server only; although itwill support SQL Server, it doesn't provide the Macintosh connectivity,integrated e-mail, inter-network routing, DPA, and other services that 3Comusers have come to know and love.andP;  3Com customers will have to wait until3+Open 2.1 to obtain a 3Com-enhanced version.andM;Partly as a consequence of 3Com's repositioning of itself as a systemintegrator, 3Com has recently made several overtures to NetWare users.andP;  One3Com executive was quoted in a trade magazine as saying that 3Com willconsider offering its network servers as NetWare platforms--a rumor wecouldn't verify but one that would make sense given 3Com's new brief.andM;The most interesting offshoot of these developments is 3Com's recentlyannounced support for on-demand (DPA) access to Novell NetWare servers from3+Open DOS client workstations.andP;  Informally called &quot;On-Demand NetWare,&quot; itenables 3+Open DOS clients to swap in the NetWare shell and IPX protocolstack to access NetWare servers.andM;Although it won't be released until this summer, we had a chance to try itout during a recent trip to 3Com's headquarters.andP;  It appears to provide fullNetWare client functionality while allowing complete 3+Open operability withlittle additional memory overhead and minimal performance penalties.andP;  In somecases NetWare server access may be even faster than it is in native NetWaremode.andM;On-demand NetWare should help 3Com get a foot in the door at NetWare siteswanting to gain access to SQL Server and other LAN Manager-basedapplications.andP;  It will also facilitate the unification of 3+Open and NetWaresystems at sites (such as our Media office) where the two coexist.andM;Installing 3+OpenandM;When we first heard about OS/2 LAN Manager and 3Com's implementation of thesame, we were excited about the possibility of introducing it into ouroperations.andP;  We have been running a two-server 3+ network in our Malibu andMedia offices since 1987.andP;  Although Media has since installed a NovellNetWare 2.15 system to support the Bestinfo typesetting system used forproduction of this report, it still uses a 3+ system for personal filestorage and for e-mail to our Malibu office.andM;3+ Mail has become a mainstay of our two-coast editorial operations; we havefound it a handy off-the-shelf solution to our internal communications needs,particularly for filing stories from Malibu to Media or from laptop PCs whileon the road.andP;  (Our article on Tops in Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  10, was written on aToshiba 1100+ in Johannesburg, South Africa, and e-mailed to our Media officevia a 3+ Remote link into our Malibu network.)andM;Peaceful coexistence.andP;  Consequently, when we went to integrate 3+Open intoour network we did so on condition that it be as transparent and asbulletproof as possible in relation to our existing 3+ network.andM;3Com had in fact implemented 3+Open with this concept in mind.andP;  Although notidentical in terms of operations or command set, 3Com has provided OS/2versions of its principal 3+ commands.andP;  For example, 3f2 is the counterpartto the 3+ 3f command; it accesses 3+ resources from 3+Open OS/2 clients.andP;  Onboth DOS and OS/2 workstations, you can use a single logon command to log yousimultaneously onto both the 3+ and the 3+Open networks.andM;Similarly on the PC and Mac sides, client workstations can access either 3+or 3+Open resources from the same workstation without needing to reboot.andP;  Ona DOS netstation, for example, it is entirely possible to be using e-mail andName services running on a 3+ server while running Backup and Internet on the3+Open server, all the while linked to a selection of 3+ and 3+Open shareddirectories and printers.andM;RAM cram.andP;  The price you pay to have this convenience is that you have to rununder the XNS protocol, particularly if you want to be able to administer the3+ network from the 3+Open side.andP;  3+Mail, Name and Internet also require XNS,so for simplicity's sake we decided right off the bat to forego the NBP orNBP/XNS DPA modes.andP;  This in theory means we have less DOS memory to playwith, although using memory extenders we have found this not to be a hugeproblem.andP;  (We typically have between 450 and 510 KB of memory left, dependingon our memory extender configuration.andP;  This is sufficient for all of theMalibu office's applications.)andP;  Moreover, Windows 3.0 will allegedly solvethis problem for us anyway, since it is said to allow up to 16 MB in which toload applications.andM;Allocation of services.andP;  We next had to decide how to allocate servicesbetween the systems.andP;  As we said earlier, 3Com has provided 3+Open versionsof most of its existing value-added services, such as 3+Mail.andP;  (All will beavailable when release 1.1E arrives.)andP;  Since we were introducing 3+Open on anew, third server (we are still unwilling to commit our office to a total 3+to 3+Open migration), we went down the list of services and allocated onlythose for which 3+Open provides significant additional value.andM;Consequently we left 3+Name and 3+Mail on the 3+ servers (along with the 3+versions of Share, Net Connect, Macintosh, and Backup, since each is specificto the 3+ network or to each 3+ server), but migrated the 3+Route/Remotefunction to the 3+Open server (in the guise of 3+Open Internet).andP;  Because wewanted to access both the 3+ and the 3+Open networks from our 3Stations, weinstalled 3+Start on the 3+Open server.andP;  We also wanted to run several SQLServer applications on our 3+Open server.andM;Finally, we needed to run Macintosh services and Backup.andP;  Since our Malibuoffice is predominantly Mac-based, and is the home of our Seminars business,it's important that each Mac have access to all network resources and thatour data be backed up nightly.andM;The 10-minute install.andP;  These issues decided, we sat down to install our3+Open network.andP;  The installation process varies depending on what type ofserver you are running.andP;  For PC-based servers, you use a floppy diskinstallation process, whereas on 3Com's 3S/521 dedicated server, you installfrom cartridge tape.andM;Either way the process is relatively straightforward, and immensely easierthan installing earlier versions of 3+ (prior to 1.3.1) or NetWare 286.andP;  Forthe tape method, you put the server in console mode, boot your netstationfrom a preconfigured floppy disk, and then type tapeins.andP;  When the tapefinishes spinning, you run netsetup, then reboot the server in operatingmode, and voila--a working 3+Open server.andM;The floppy disk method is only slightly more complicated.andP;  To install on a PCserver, you boot the PC from the Server OS/2 Install disk, and then afterOS/2 is installed you insert the server install disk and type netsetup.andP;  Tenor so disk changes later, you reboot the PC and presto! a working 3+Openserver.andM;Value-added services are installed in a different fashion.andP;  Each comes on adisk with a program called 3sis which both installs and enables theapplication.andP;  The initial applications we received required somepost-installation parameter tweaking.andP;  Internet is the worst case, since ifyou don't do the tweaking, you can prevent the server from booting.andO;(Incidentally, the values in the Internet manual are wrong; you must read therelease notes.)andP;  The latest application we installed, 3+Open for Macintosh(second beta version), installed flawlessly, with all the parameter tweakingtaken care of automatically by the install program.andM;SQL Server, which is not a 3Com product, has its own installation routine.andO;It is not a trivial process.andM;Memory requirements.andP;  OS/2 applications are notorious for being memory hogs,and LAN Manager is no exception.andP;  You can't get a 3+Open server off theground with less than 4 MB of memory.andP;  With three services running, ittypically requires 5 MB (4 MB on a 3S/521, since it provides 356 KB ofadditional memory in the bottom 1 MB memory map); five services will require5-6 MB, and six or more take at least 8 MB, depending on the application.andM;3+Open also makes extensive use of disk caching, allocating up to 6 MB of RAMto help speed up disk I/O.andP;  The 3S/521 enhances this even further bytriple-porting its memory, allowing direct transfers among RAM, disk, andnetwork adapter.andM;Given this situation and our desire to experiment with SQL Server and otherserver-based applications, we decided not to mess around: we installed 16 MBin our server.andP;  Our backup PC server has 8 MB.andP;  With 1-MB SIMMs costing lessthan $100 these days, why not?andM;As it is, our 20-MHz '386-equipped 3S/500 appears to be processor-bound,rather than memory-limited, when SQL Server, Macintosh, Internet and Backupare all running.andP;  We recommend you don't cut corners when buying your serverto run 3+Open; get the hottest box you can afford, and load it with a minimumof 8 MB of RAM and a 250-MB (or more) fast ESDI or SCSI disk.andM;3+Open featuresandM;Once up and running, 3+Open functions analogously to 3+.andP;  You share diskdirectories, printers, and communications ports, and access them by linkingto them from your netstation.andP;  The principal difference between 3+ and 3+Openis that the command syntax used to access the 3+Open server is based onMicrosoft's MS-NET conventions, whereas in 3+, 3Com has provided its ownstreamlined set of commands to accomplish the same purpose.andM;For example, linking to a shared director on a 3+ server requires use of the3f command, as follows:andM;3f link g: //pub/reports/andM;To link to a shared directory on the 3+Open server, you specify the commandthusly:andM;net use g: //wildlife/dosapps/andM;One annoying aspect of the net command syntax is that you have to explicitly&quot;delete&quot; a resource that is associated with a given drive ID rather thansimply copying over it as you can with the 3f command sequence; eg.andP;  net useg: /d and then net use g: //server/newshare.andP;  Also, you can't use the 3fcommands to link to 3+Open resources, though you can use the net use commandto link to 3+ resources.andM;3+Open's ubiquitous net command is the key to unlocking many LAN Managermysteries.andP;  If evoked standalone, it also functions as a menu shell fromwhich you can use a mouse to select servers and services, and to link toshared devices.andP;  It can also be used to send broadcast messages to any otheruser or groups of users on the network.andP;  It also allows you to easily displayworkstation statistics--3Com and Microsoft have gone statistics-mad in LANManager, presumably to counter the success NetWare has had with its rich setof administrative tracking and management tools.andM;Security.andP;  3+Open's logon and security features are an improvement over 3+--up to a point.andP;  Whereas 3+ was limited to share-level security, whichassociates a password protection scheme with a given shared directory, 3+Openadds user-level security as an alternative.andP;  You specify which one you wantto use at server installation, and from then on, all workstations on a givenserver must use that security level.andP;  User-level security associates a givenuser or group of users with each shared resource.andP;  Once a user logs on, hehas immediate access to those resources for which he has access privileges.andM;We elected to install user-level security in our office because it is easierto administer.andP;  We have found that even computer-literate office workersdon't like to hassle with remembering passwords and such.andP;  With user-levelsecurity establishing the access privileges each person has for each sharedresource, once they log on, they don't have to think about it again.andM;The permissions available in user-level security include create (both filesand directories within the shared resource), delete, read, write, execute,change file attributes, and change LAN Manager permissions (for a givenresource).andM;All PC-based 3+Open servers are inherently concurrent workstations as well.andO;Indeed, in LAN Manager, a server must first start up as a workstation (andlog onto itself) before it is a ble to invoke the server boot process.andP;  Thismeans that any user working on that PC will have access to the completeresources of the server's hard disk.andP;  In our office, security isn't amission-critical issue, so this state of affairs isn't a show stopper, but wecan understand why others might not find this to be satisfactory.andP;  3Com hasturned this into a selling point for its proprietary network servers: lackingany keyboard, floppy drive or monitor, they are reasonably secure.andM;Another key difference between 3+ and 3+Open's logon service is that 3+ usesa 3-part name:domain:organization identification for each user on thenetwork, whereas 3+Open employs the NetBIOS convention of a single name.andO;Although you can run the OS/2 version of 3+Name on the 3_Open server, itcurrently exists for 3+Open Mail purposes only.andP;  3+Open 1.1 doesn't &quot;know&quot;about different domains, which can be inconvenient in a multi-serverenvironment.andP;  Domain service will be available in LAN Manager 2.0, however,and 3Com indicated that it will provide a true 3+Open Name service, whichwill be X.500 compatible, later this year.andM;Phantom server.andP;  Because each LAN Manager workstation--server and netstationalike--represents a unique NetBIOS entity (which stems from the days whenMS-NET was a peer-to-peer LAN operating system), you can &quot;log onto&quot; LANManager regardless of whether a server is up and running.andP;  You also can netuse devices for which you have no user privileges, linking them to a givendrive ID, only to get a &quot;net error&quot; message when you try to read or write tothat drive.andM;On the positive side, if the server goes down while you are working, yourworkstation doesn't lock up; you simply get net errors until the server comesback up.andP;  Once it is up again, you suddenly have access to all your netresources again, without having to log on again or reboot your netstation.andM;Administration.andP;  3+'s lack of useful administrative tools has been one of itsweakest spots in its fight against Novell.andP;  Both Microsoft and 3Com haveattempted to address this shortcoming in LAN Manager and 3+Open.andM;Most network management functions of 3+Open are much improved, providing awealth of network statistics, management functions, audit trails, and errorlogs.andP;  These are accessible on OS/2 netstations by invoking the net admin//servername command sequence.andP;  This brings up the same menu that you obtainby invoking net alone, but with additional functions on the menu bar.andM;From the net admin menu, you can create, examine, modify, or delete networkresources, assign permissions, and examine network statistics (which mayalert you to system or network errors but don't necessarily identify wherethey have occurred) and error logs nwhich do provide specific, albeitcryptic, information on network errors).andP;  You can even modify permissions forspecific named pipes.andM;We were annoyed to find that net admin doesn't automatically save any changesyou make with it.andP;  For 3+Open to remember any new shared resources you'veestablished (or, for that matter, any you've discarded), you have remember tosave them in a file called srvshare.pro which is accessed from the Configmenu.andP;  Microsoft (whose code it is) should change this to ensure that allmodifications are saved automatically when the changes are made.andM;Profiles.andP;  3+Open makes extensive use of profiles, which are script filesthat automate many of the tedious functions a user would have to do to accessnetwork resources.andP;  This is essential because, as we noted earlier, mostusers don't really want to hassle with the complexities of the process; theysimply want to get on with their jobs.andM;Once a PC netstation is configured to your liking, you can type net save andthe system will take a snapshot of your current LAN connections for lateruse.andP;  It is placed in a profile, located in a directory on your workstation'sdisk that is always checked when you first start up.andP;  Any reconfiguration canbe captured by repeating the process, overriding the previousconfiguration--a nice touch for those of us who have to manage LANs.andM;Rough edges.andP;  Overall, 3Com has done a nice job of providing individual toolsto manage specific network resources, but so far hasn't integrated them intoa single cohesive system.andP;  For example, 3+Open for Macintosh has its ownadministrative resource, which is similar but not identical to the net adminfunction.andP;  Similarly, the otherwise-excellent 3+Open Internet administrativemenu isn't linked to net admin or netsetup.andP;  The latter program gives you theoption to configure the communications port your have just assigned to yourprinter using the netsetup administrative functions.andM;3Com explains that the separation of administrative functions into differentprograms was necessary because Microsoft developed net admin, while 3Comcreated the rest.andP;  This is understandable, but the problem is that 3Com iscompeting against Novell, whose network OS was designed by one team.andP;  Clearlythe situation isn't acceptable in the long run, although we can live with theinconvenience in the short term as long as we know something better is comingalong.andP;  (Isn't it, 3Com?)andM;Print spoolers.andP;  3+Open allows you to set up one or more print spoolers onyour server.andP;  Doing so is a two-step progress, requiring two differentprograms, and made all the more complicated by the fact that thedocumentation describing this process is vague and, in the case of setting upthe PostScript despooler, wrong.andP;  (This, too, has been corrected insubsequent editions of the documentation.)andM;Netsetup provides a menu item for configuring network printers.andP;  However,once you fire it up, you discover that it can only configure serial printerports.andP;  Moreover, once you configure the port, you are asked to create aseparator file (used to divide print jobs for easy identification at theprinter) and &quot;manage a reset sequence.&quot;andP;  What's worse is that the screen withwhich you create these files asks you to select from preexisting separatorand rest sequence files, but gives you no means of viewing the ones that areavailable.andP;  The documentation isn't helpful on this score; it's written as ifyou were born with the knowledge of how to do this.andM;Once you navigate through the setup process and you decipher the typos in themanual (ignoring completely the separator and reset file requirement, sinceonce you create one you can't find it to use it).andP;  the spooler function worksreasonably well.andP;  This is no mean accomplishment, since OS/2 spoolers ingeneral have to date been notoriously slow.andM;3+Open for Macintosh.andP;  When we reviewed 3+, we criticized 3Com for adoptingits own proprietary protocol for its 3+Macintosh product.andP;  In bypassingAppleShare and Apple's AFP protocols, 3Com left itself open to complaintsthat it was out of step with the Macintosh mainstream.andP;  Certainly Novellexploited this effectively when it introduced NetWare for Macintosh, whichwas &quot;fully AppleShare/AFP compliant.&quot;andP;  (No matter that it didn't work untilversion 1.1.)andM;3Com has rectified this sin by making 3+Open AppleShare/AFP compliant.andP;  Toaccess a 3+Open for Macintosh volume, you simply click on the appleShare iconin the Chooser, mount the volume you want, and go.andP;  All resources in theshared volume are governed by tha native set of AppleShare privileges.andO;Unlike Novell, 3Com hasn't much enhanced its Macintosh product to providesecurity capabilities above and beyond what you get in AppleShare.andP;  In fact,certain AppleShare conventions, such as the ability to assign a different setof privileges to a folder from that of the folder in which it resides, gobeyond what you can do on the PC side of 3+Open.andM;As on the PC, you can run the 3+ Macintosh service concurrently with 3+Openfor Macintosh and can have volumes from each available on your desktop.andP;  Forthat matter, you can also run NetWare for the Macintosh concurrently with thetwo 3Com Mac services.andP;  In our Media office, we find this arrangementprovides us with a low-cost, no-frills bridge between the 3Com and Novellserver environments.andM;Speed uber alles.andP;  So with 3+Open for the Macintosh we have the best of bothworlds, AFP compatibility and 3Com's high-performance Macintoshservice--right?andP;  Well, we're no longer as sure of this as we were.andP;  True, 3+Macintosh software has been one of the principal causes of incompatiblitieswith the new breed of CI and FX Macs.andP;  But then why aren't we jumping for joyover 3+Open Macintosh?andM;Bearing in mind that the 3+Open Macintosh software we tested it still betacode, and hence not optimized for performance, we have nevertheless inpractice found it to be slower than our 3+ Macintosh service running on our3Com 16-MHZ '386-based 3S/401 server.andP;  For a rough benchmark (by no meansmeant to be comprehensive or even representative of how each system wouldperform under a wide range of network loads), we timed how long it took tocopy a WriteNow 2.2 program folder (10 files, totalling 650 KB) from a CXworkstation to a variety of servers under lightly loaded conditions (one ortwo users).andP;  Our results were as follows:andM;Server  Time (seconds) 3+Open beta (20-MHZ '386)  29 3+ version 1.5 (16-MHZ'386)  17 3+ version 1.5 (8-MHZ '186)  38 Tops 3.0 (Sun 386i)  19 Tops 3.0(Mac IIci)  33 NetWare for Mac 1.1 (16-MHZ '386)  75andM;Time to launch WriteNow 2.2 (with no disk cache enabled) on a CX from each ofthe above servers, plus the local hard disk for comparison (7 seconds), wereas follows:andM;Server  Time (seconds) 3+Opera beta (20-MHZ '386)  13 3+ 1.5 (16-MHZ '386)  63+ 1.5 (8-MHZ '186)  9 Tops 3.0 (Sun 386i)  6 Tops 3.0 (Mac IIci)  7 NetWareMac 1.1 (16-MHZ '386)  11andM;Aside from pointing out that NetWare for the Macintosh is no speed demon, thetests suggest that 3+Open pays a performance penalty by comforming to theApple protocols.andP;  (Note that Tops is not an AFP server either.)andP;  It alsounderscores why Guy Kawasaki, former Mac evangelist and ex-CEO of Acius, usedto recommend 3Com's 3+Macintosh as being the optimum Macintosh networkoperating system in terms of server performance.andM;Consequently, in an all-Macintosh environment we'd be tempted to stay with3+Macintosh--for as long as 3Com offers and supports it--unless we want tointroduce PCs or run SQL Server or other server-based applications availableonly via 3+Opera.andP;  In a mixed environment, however, 3+Open will eventually bethe clear choice once LAN Manager 2.0 is shipping and more server-basedapplications are out.andM;Internet.andP;  3+Open Internet represents a complete rewrite and combination ofthe 3 + Route and 3 + Remote programs.andP;  The 3+Open Internet service managerscommunications between physically separate networks via modems.andP;  It canconnect to either a 3 + Open or a 3 + remote network, and allows dial-inaccess from remote PCs.andP;  It is also the &quot;forwarder&quot; portion of the 3 + Mailsystem, automatically dialing the destination for any e-mail messageaddressed to a recognizable outside entity.andM;We chose to run Internet instead of 3 + Route and 3+  Remote because it wasfunctionally identical--it handles the remote requirements of both our 3 +and 3 + Open networks--and and has the added bonus of providing extensivesecurity and administrative tools.andM;We recently had a hacker try to get into our system--an impossible taskunless he has 3Com's Remote software and a valid password--and were able totrack his progress via Internet's Comm Port Status monitor.andP;  A completerecord of all incoming and outgoing comm traffic is recorded in the TrafficLog File, which displays the network name and phone number of each remoteconnection, the time and duration of the connection, number of bytes, packetsand errors that were exchanged, and so on.andM;Internet was written to be protocol-independent; it can interconnect networksrunning XNS and X.25, with OSI and TCP/IP to follow later this year.andP;  It is aslick implementation that has worked flawlessly since we first installed it,and is one of our favorite 3+Open applications to date.andM;Problems.andP;  We have commented on many of the problems we have experienced withthe installation and operation of 3 + Open in the preceding sections.andP;  Ingeneral, the problems are about what you would expect for a new networkoperating system of 3+Open's complexity.andP;  For the record, we should note thatwe had comparatively few problems once we had sorted out discrepancies in thedocumentation and installation processes of the various applications.andP;  By andlarge 3+Open works--it takes a lickin' (mostly from our ad-hocinterpretations of sometimes erroneous documentation) and keeps on tickin'.andO;The server has never crashed or halted in an unexpected manner after we'vegotten the parameters properly tweaked.andP;  Individual applications (e.g., thefirst Macintosh beta code) have crashed, but have not disturbed other 3+Openservices.andP;  This is one of the beauties of a fully preemptive networkoperating system.andM;There are two 3+Open applications, however, that have given us fits since weinstalled them.andM;Automatic backup is a must for any network server, in our book.andP;  We have usedthe 3+Backup program on our 3+ servers for two years.andP;  On more than oneoccasion we've been able to retrieve &quot;lost&quot; files or folders from a backuptape, and once we had to restore an entire server after a power failurecorrupted its disk.andM;We have set up our 3+ servers to back themselves up every night.andP;  Weinitially wanted to do the same with 3+Open, but for several months wecouldn't get it to run.andP;  Once we sorted out the problem (which was a resultof our not having read the installation instructions very carefully), we thenhad to confront a menu-driven backup program that was far inferior to its 3+cousin.andP;  For example, 3+ gives you a real-time display of the backup'sprogress, which allows you to start a restore and then cancel it after it hascopied the items you want from the tape.andM;Now with 3+Open backup.andP;  You have to pull down a menu and select status,which gives you some (but by no means comprehensive) data on where the backupor restore is at that moment in time only.andP;  Moreover, there is no way to stopa backup or restore once you initiate it.andP;  And what's worse, since it is amultitasking application, you can conceivably launch a backup and a restoreto the same device simultaneously, with unpredictable results.andP;  Back to thedrawing board, 3Com!andP;  (Why not just clone 3+Backup?)andM;The other problem is with 3+Open Start.andP;  We chose to move over to 3+Open'sversion of Start so that our diskless workstations could access the 3+Openserver as well as our 3+ servers.andP;  Once we made the switch we discovered thatfor some unknown reason XyWrite drops characters as we are typing.andP;  Neither3Com nor xyquest can figure out why this is happening, so we have gone backto using 3+Start until someone solves this problem.andM;Performance.andP;  We have already commented on 3+Open for Macintosh performance.andO;Again, we want to remind you that the software in question was beta code, andtherefore may not be completely representative of how the finished productwill perform.andP;  but we believe our observations will still stand when all issaid and done.andM;We ran a series of speed tests on the PC side similar to those we ran on theMac side.andP;  We copied a 655-KB file, swapper.dat, and obtained the followingresults.andM;Server  Time (seconds) 3+Open 1.1 (20-MHZ '386)  3 3+ 1.5 (16-MHZ '386)  6 3+1.5 (8-MHZ '186)  8 Local disk to local disk  3andM;These results confirm the impression we have gotten from using the product ineveryday office work: that, at least in the lightly loaded situation in whichwe conducted these tests, the 3 + Open server appears to be faster than the3+ servers.andP;  Since all servers are using the same DOS FAT format file system,these results aren't very surprising; the 3 + Open server is a hotter box,and OS/2 is known to provide faster directory and copy operations than DOS.andM;We expect that PC file operations will benefit even more from migrating tothe Microsoft HPFS (high performance file system) that will be available inLAN Manager 2.0.andM;The publishing connectionandM;Our experience with 3 + Open to date has suggested that it is certainlysuitable for a mixed environment business office, albeit with a few roughedges that we expect to be addressed in the next several releases.andP;  But whatabout its potential for a publishing operation?andP;  What does it offer thatNovell's NetWare, the current de facto publishing LAN of choice, doesn't?andM;Since we haven't yet attempted to use 3 + Open in our Media office, where ourpublications are produced, we can't answer this question directly at thistime.andP;  But we recently had the opportunity to find out how 3 + Open is usedas an integral part of a legal document management system at the law officesof Perkins Cole in Seattle.andP;  Gilbert andamp; Associates, a technical consultingfirm based in Pacific Palisades, CA, recently developed a system for PerkinsCole in which 3+Open provides the core network services.andP;  We believe that thePerkins Cole system could easily be modified to provide the framework for aneffective technical publication management system as well.andM;Little custom software.andP;  Developed entirely with off-the-shelf applications,including 3 + Open (using the NBP protocol), Saro's FileShare, Microsoft Wordfor Windows, Pioneer Software's Qandamp;E database manager, Polari's PackRat, DaVinci's eMail for Windows, and Mead Data's Windows Session Manager for Lexis,Gilbert was able to construct a system that balances the personalefficiencies of a decentralized office computing environment and thecentralized document assembly needs of a 350-attorney law firm.andM;Gilbert's research indicated that lawyers had little tolerance for contextswitching among a variety of applications and user interfaces.andP;  So early onGilbert decided that a Windows-based environment, using Word for Windows (themost frequently used application) as the default user interface, would bestsatisfy attorneys' demands for &quot;maximizing the familiar.&quot;andM;Significantly, very little of the development required custom code.andP;  Becauseof its extensive macro language and Windows' Dynamic Data Exchange, Word forWindows does not have the same limits to its use as a group tool as dotypical DOS character-based applications.andP;  Using the WordBasic macro language(Microsoft's answer to HyperTalk) and the DDE built into Saros FileShare,Gilbert has been able to devise a system where users don't have to delve intothe mysteries (and the separate user interface) of FileShare.andP;  Indeed, theydon't even have to leave Word for Windows to use it.andP;  In fact, most users donot even have access rights to the 3+Open network servers containing theirdocuments.andM;FileShare as system software.andP;  We wrote about Saros FileShare when it wasfirst introduced (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  11, p. 32).andP;  FileShare's database is anOS/2 application built on top of SQL Server.andP;  The client side, however, is awindows-based DOS application.andP;  Unlike the native SQL Server, which has noprovisions for crossing server boundaries, FileShare is a true distributeddatabase application capable of running on multiple servers concurrently.andP;  Auser doesn't have to know where the document resides on the network toretrieve it; FileShare handles the routing and retrieval for him.andM;FileShare was initially positioned as a file management system with its ownWindows-based user interface--in other words, an application.andP;  We think thatit is more natural to view it as system software, ideally as part of the LANsoftware itself, but also more appropriately front-ended by a dominant userapplication, like a word processor.andM;The latter is Gilbert's approach.andP;  For almost all standard services, usersnever leave Word for Windows, nor do they know that documents are coming tothem (or leaving them) from a separate application.andP;  Macros and DDE performall of this in the background.andM;Integrated suite of standalone applications.andP;  As an example of how Gilberthas set up the system to simplify the execution of complicated tasks, we'lllook at the problem of sending portions of a document via telex.andP;  A PerkinsCole attorney first creates the text in question with Word for Windows (whichmight have originated from the FileShare database, but in any event willeventually be filed there).andP;  Using DDE, a macro is used to search PackRat forthe recipient's name (which is stored in plain English).andP;  Using routinginformation maintained in PackRat, it then sends the requested message viaDDE to Da Vinci eMail, which routes it automatically through MCI Mail to thetelex service provider.andM;To the user, a single function has occurred.andP;  To the computer, informationdatabases have been polled to retrieve relevant routing information, andseveral messages have been sent to other applications using the informationobtained from the first, server application.andM;Why 3+Open?andP;  Gilbert conceded that most of the DOS applications used in thesystem could have been implemented just as easily on a Novell network insteadof the 3+Open one used.andP;  There were several reasons why 3+Open got the nod,however, not the least being its ability to run SQL Server and FileShare.andO;Moreover, Novell has yet to implement DOS named pipe support; consequently,it would have been impossible to run the DOS client portion on a Novellnetwork with the SQL portion of a LAN Manager server.andM;Just as important, Gilbert believes that 3+Open provides a richer developmentenvironment than NetWare.andP;  The tight coupling of LAN Manager to OS/2 meansthat Gilbert is working with the API set that it believes most of the keyapplications in the future will utilize.andP;  In fact, Gilbert intends to convertits own office over from a NetWare 286-based LAN to a 3+Open-based LAN in thenear future to take advantage of the same tools that it has provided toPerkins Cole.andM;Waiting for 2.0 ...andM;3 + Open LAN Manager 1.1 provides a mixed bag of goodies and headaches thatmakes any decision for us to convert our office over to it exclusively aneasy one to defer.andP;  But we wouldn't want to run our office without it,either.andP;  It has the potential to exceed what 3+ and NetWare 286 can provideby a large margin.andP;  3 + Open's intimate coupling with OS/2--which we believewill be the dominant desktop operating system in the 1990s--leaves us feelinga lot more secure with it than with NetWare 386.andP;  (Of course, you--using muchthe same logic--might reach exactly the opposite conclusion.)andM;Certainly, were we attempting to implement a SQL Server-based application, oreven attempting to replicate the Perkins Cole system for our own publication,we might be willing, even eager, to take the plunge now.andP;  We have found that3+Open works and is relatively bug free, even if it does have features thatannoy us and administrative tools that have yet to be integrated.andP;  That itworks, and doesn't crash on us periodically, does much to commend it forincorporation into any live production environment.andM;We will continue to run it concurrently with our older 3+ system, continuingto partition the service according to where they deliver the biggest bang forthe buck with minimum hassle.andP;  Over time, we will undoubtedly migrate more ofour services from 3+ to 3+ Open.andP;  Eventually, we will find outselves running3+Open exclusively.andM;In the end we find ourselves waiting for the next major release, 3+Open LANManager 2.0, which we suspect might be the release that will nudge us overthe wall into the 3+ Open camp.andP;  It represents a significant improvement overwhat is currently available in 1.1  (See accompanying box for the details.)andO;Moreover, 3Com has assured us that it will continue to improve thevalue-added services, such as Backup, and will provide additionalcapabilities that will improve network management, such as a new Name servicethat will work with 2.0's domain function.andM;Of course our Media office may decide, for equally valid reasons, to upgradefrom NetWare 286 to NetWare 386 in the same time frame.andM;In spite of LAN Manager's promise, the fact does remain that most of theindustrial strength publishing applications available have been writtenexpressly for the NetWare environment.andP;  Only when such applications areavailable for 3+Open--or when 3+Open achieves a true state ofinteroperability with NetWare's APIs--will the choice of LAN OS be a matterof personal preference, rather than necessity.andM;3Com is counting on many current NetWare users not remaining content to stickwith what they know, particularly once they get a taste (perhaps viaOn-demand NetWare) of the bright shiny future of client-server computing.andM;With Microsoft and IBM advocating much the same strategy, with the samenetwork API set, 3Com may find itself moving up to the first tier of LANsoftware suppliers--at Novell's expense.andM;3Com's 3+Open ProductsandM;An enterprise-wide system integrator/supplier, 3Com sells a full range of LANand WAN products, including file servers, network interfaces, gateways,routers and bridges.andP;  It also offers a range of Ethernet diagnostic tools, aswell as two network operating systems, 3+ and 3+ Open.andP;  We have been toldthat the next release of 3+, 1.6, will be the last for the MS-NET-basednetwork operating system.andP;  For better or for worse, 3Com's future is firmlyhitched to the fortunes of 3+Open.andM;We have previously described 3Com's Client-Server System configurations andpricing (see Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  2), and will not repeat these here.andP;  Listed beloware 3+Open operating system software configurations and pricing information.andO;All 3+Open products require an 80286 or 80386-based PC, or one of thecompany's 80386-based proprietary servers (the 3S/400 and 3S/500 series).andO;PCs can run as concurrent server/workstations, whereas 3Com's proprietaryservers run in dedicated mode.andM;3+Open LAN Manager Entry Level SystemsandM;3+Open LAN Manager Entry Level I offers all LAN Manager capabilities otherthan auto-connect and disconnect for up to 5 concurrent OS/2 or DOS users.andO;It does not support 3Com's value-added services.andP;
