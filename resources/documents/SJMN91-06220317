Olive oil is 77 percent monounsaturated fatty acids, more than anyoil. Canola oil is next with 62 percent monounsaturated fatty acid, followedby peanut oil with 49 percent.;    The report states that more research isneeded to confirm these findings. More research also is needed to explain whymonounsaturated fats appear to reduce coronary disease risk factors.;    So,what is a consumer to do? First, consult your physician or dietitian beforeyou make drastic dietary changes. Second, don't think that if a little isgood, more is better.;    Third, remember the golden rule in creating any typeof eating program: moderation. And fourth, remember that any oil is high incalories. One tablespoon of olive oil contains 120 calories and is 100 percentfat.;    If you come from a family of Mediterranean heritage, chances areolive oil always has been a basic part of your diet. Cultivated as many as8,000 years ago, olive oil was prized by the people of ancient Mediterraneancivilizations as a major food source and food preservative. They also used itas a body ointment, a skin cleanser, wound healer and as a fuel for lamps.;   Excellent olive oil may come from Italy, France, Greece, Spain or California.Like wine, an olive oil's flavor is affected by the soil in which the fruit isgrown, the time and method of harvesting and how the olives were stored beforepressing.;    Michael Besso, director of marketing for Bertolli Olive Oil,sounds like a winemaker as he talks about the product. &quot;Olive oil isclassified according to four different characteristics: color, taste, smelland acidity,&quot; he said.;    &quot;Once the oil is extracted from the olives andpoured off, it is sent to an olive oil master who samples the oil to defineits color, taste and smell. The oil is then chemically tested to define itsacidity level.&quot;;    According to Besso, olive oil with an unsaturated fattyacid content of less than 1 percent is classified as extra virgin. Extravirgin olive oil is usually dark green and has a strong fruity or pepperytaste, like ripe olives. It is best used in recipes in which its unique flavorwill be enhanced. Try it on salads and in marinades.;    Medium green to darkyellow in color, virgin olive oil by law may contain up to 3.3 percentunsaturated fatty acid. This more economical grade of olive oil is less fruityin flavor but is also excellent on salads and in marinades.;    Pure olive oilis usually light gold in color. It is filtered through gauze sheets to removeacid, color and odor. Small amounts of extra virgin oil are added for flavor.Because of its processing, it is lighter in flavor than extra virgin or virginoils and has an acidity of 0.18 percent.;     PESTO PRESTO;  A yummy recipefrom the Spectrum Naturals &quot;Kitchen Guide&quot; brochure.; 3 cups fresh basil,carefully washed and stemmed;  3/4 cup parsley, stemmed;  3/4 cup gratedParmesan;  1/2 cup olive oil;  1/2 cup pine nuts or almonds; 2 large clovesgarlic;  Combine all ingredients in a food processor fitted with a metal bladeor in a blender.
