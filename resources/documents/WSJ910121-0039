In years past, producers could count on Soviets to be thebad guys in spy thrillers and action adventures, but theywere left adrift with glasnost. Now Iraq has become the bullyin several upcoming films.</LP><TEXT>   The working titles, not surprisingly, include &quot;DesertShield&quot; and &quot;Desert Storm.&quot; A third movie, &quot;The HumanShield,&quot; is loosely based on the Iraqi seizure of hostageslast summer.   The films are being made by small, independent filmmakers.Most big studios say they aren't currently working on anymovies with Persian Gulf-related plots. &quot;I would think thatwould be in very bad taste,&quot; said a spokeswoman for NewsCorp.'s Fox Inc. unit. &quot;Is anyone really doing that?&quot;   Arab-American groups have the same reaction. &quot;Films thatportray Iraq as the enemy could heighten the animosity towardArabs in general,&quot; frets Don Bustany, president of the LosAngeles chapter of the American-Arab Anti-DiscriminationCommittee. &quot;Most Americans can't find an Arab country on theglobe much less distinguish between Arabs.&quot;   Industry analysts are quick to point out that linking amovie to a current crisis doesn't guarantee a wide audience.&quot;People are likely to become less tolerant now of movies withviolence or destruction,&quot; says Harold Vogel, an analyst atMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. &quot;If it's happening in real life, it's notso funny or entertaining.&quot;   When the Gulf crisis erupted last summer, at least two ofthe movies were already in the works, and their producersquickly changed the scripts to involve Iraq. Producer MenahemGolan had been working on &quot;Seals,&quot; a movie project aboutunderwater commandos. But last July, Orion Pictures Corp.came out with &quot;Navy Seals,&quot; creating a problem.   So Mr. Golan switched his title to &quot;Desert Shield&quot; andchanged the enemy to Iraq from another &quot;unidentified&quot; countryin the Middle East. He also dispatched the writer anddirector to Israel where the movie was filmed. &quot;We areinspired by the events that are going on, no question,&quot; saysMr. Golan. &quot;We are waiting for history to give us the finalact.&quot;   The movie, which stars Rob Lowe, tells the story of twobuddies who meet in underwater training and again on amission in the Persian Gulf. Their assignment: wipe out amilitary installation targeting U.S. ships with chemicalwarheads. The film crew is now assembling TV news footage foruse in the film, including clips of President Bush and SaddamHussein.   Mr. Golan, who is chairman and chief executive officer of21st Century Film Corp., says he plans to show the film atthe Cannes Film Festival in France in May. But he may changethe title &quot;in order not to let anyone feel that we areexploiting the situation,&quot; he says.   A spokeswoman for Mr. Golan says the Iraqis are portrayed&quot;very objectively&quot; and have no major roles in the movie.   Producer Roger Corman also happened to be working on a spythriller starring David Carradine when the Gulf crisiserupted. The movie, called &quot;Shield of Honor&quot; recently became&quot;Desert Storm.&quot;   The movie script originally told the story of a Libyan-ledplot to destroy Israel. But now it's an Iraqi-led plot todestroy Israel. A female CIA agent who made her way throughthe desert to Tripoli, Libya, in the first version now headstoward the American Embassy in Baghdad.   &quot;As soon as we knew we had troops building up, we hadcameras over there,&quot; says Mike Elliott, vice president ofproduction for Mr. Corman's Concorde Pictures. &quot;It makes thefilm more timely.&quot; The crews filmed in Egypt and Israel afterbeing denied access to Iraq and parts of Saudi Arabia. Mr.Elliott says the U.S. Army is providing some film footagefrom Iraq and Saudi Arabia for the movie.   Israelis and Egyptians play the Iraqi parts. &quot;None of themare portrayed as maniacs or insane people,&quot; says Mr. Elliott.&quot;They are soldiers who work hard and believe in their cause.&quot;   When real fighting broke out, however, the production cameto a temporary halt. &quot;No one wants to work in Israel becauseof the war,&quot; says Mr. Elliott. &quot;If things don't clear up,we'll change the location of the picture.&quot; He says thecompany expects to release the movie by spring.   Mr. Corman has linked other movie projects to news eventssuch as the Panamanian invasion, the fall of the Berlin Walland the San Francisco earthquake. Mr. Corman, known as theking of the schlock films, declined to be interviewed forfear the movie would appear to be capitalizing on the war.&quot;He doesn't want to seem like a villain,&quot; says Mr. Elliott.   A third movie, &quot;The Human Shield,&quot; finished filming inIsrael Jan. 10 -- just five days before the United Nationsdeadline for an Iraqi withdrawal from Kuwait.   The movie, made by Cannon Pictures Inc., was inspired bynewspaper stories about the hostage crisis in Iraq lastAugust. &quot;We picked up a line here and a line there and triedto enlarge it into a dramatic piece,&quot; says Ted Post, thedirector. &quot;It deals with the conflict of the Western mind vs.the Arab mind.&quot;   Mr. Post says the movie tells the story of a young U.S.colonel &quot;like Oliver North&quot; who tries to stop an Iraqicolonel from killing an old woman and a child in a Kurdishvillage. During the struggle, the U.S. officer, played byMichael Dudikoff, slashes the Iraqi's face with a knife. TheIraqi officer gets revenge by arranging to have the Americanofficer's brother seized as a hostage in Kuwait.   &quot;There are good Iraqis and bad Iraqis in the movie,&quot; saysMr. Post. The movie is now being edited and Mr. Post says hedoesn't know when it will be released. But he adds, &quot;Thequicker, the better.&quot;   Another movie in the works, &quot;Target U.S.A.,&quot; plays on oneof America's worst fears -- an Iraqi terrorist plot againstthe U.S. Actor Anthony James, who is scheduled to play amajor role, says the producer, Charles Nizet, felt thesubject &quot;would be timely.&quot; The movie has been filming inIsrael, Egypt, Belgium and the Nevada desert, Mr. James says.Mr. Nizet didn't return phone calls.   Asked how the Iraqis are portrayed, Mr. James says themovie &quot;is pretty generic. It's not a character study and notthat complex. It's an excuse for an action film. You must notlook too deeply.&quot;   A few movies released in the last two weeks that seem tobe tied to the Gulf crisis really aren't, their makersinsist. Any overlap is just a coincidence, they say.Paramount Pictures, a unit of Paramount Communications Inc.,released &quot;Flight of the Intruder&quot; last Friday, andcommercials for the Vietnam War saga have run frequentlyduring Cable News Network coverage of the Iraq crisis.   The TV commercials show fighter planes and actors WillemDafoe and Brad Johnson in military uniforms sitting in acockpit. &quot;Loyalty,&quot; &quot;Bravery&quot; and &quot;Sacrifice&quot; flash on thescreen in bold letters.   But Paramount says it picked the release date last June,long before the U.N. set its deadline. &quot;The marketingcampaign had absolutely nothing to do with events that aregoing on in the world,&quot; says Barry London, co-president ofParamount Pictures' motion picture group.   Similarly, the MGM-Pathe Communications Co. unit of PatheCommunications Co. says last summer it picked Jan. 11 torelease &quot;Not Without My Daughter.&quot; The movie, starring SallyField, is based on the true story of a woman who married anIranian and then had to plot her escape from Iran. ManyMuslims in the U.S. have criticized the film as anti-Islamic.   &quot;Iraq hasn't affected the marketing of the movie,&quot; insistsBarry Lorie, executive vice president of marketing. &quot;Theproblem is coincidental.&quot; But a spokeswoman for Sally Fieldsays the actress had hired a personal security guard afterreceiving threats triggered by her role in the film.   Agents say movies pegged to major news events are moretypically made for television. And the gulf crisis is findingits way into a few TV shows. &quot;Major Dad,&quot; the half-hoursituation comedy series broadcast on CBS Inc.'s network, willfilm an episode this week that will deal with the character'sreaction to the war. The show is scheduled to air Feb. 4.   &quot;A Different World,&quot; a sitcom on General Electric Co.'sNBC network, broadcast a show Jan. 10 that dealt with thepossibility of war. The episode featured a Reservist who wascalled up for duty in the Persian Gulf and it examined thecharacters' feelings about war.   Not everyone is jumping on the bandwagon. The ABC unit ofCapital Cities/ABC Inc. says it isn't planning any similarGulf-related shows. Indeed, on Saturday the network pulledthe second half of the premiere of &quot;Under Cover,&quot; anaction-adventure series about a husband and wife who work fora Central Intelligence Agency-type organization. The two-partpremiere was set in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. ABC said itwon't broadcast the Part 2 because of the &quot;obvioussituation.&quot;   One well-known Hollywood agent says he doesn't expect toreceive any scripts about the Persian Gulf. &quot;It's too seriousa situation,&quot; says Jim Wiatt. &quot;I can't imagine how anyonewould dramatize it. Just watch CNN. That's the most dramaticthing I've ever seen.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
