(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gov. Evan Mecham's former appointmentssecretary testified at his impeachment trial today that campaigncontributions were a criterion, but not a major one, in makingappointments to state boards and commissions.   Sam Udall also testified that he did not immediately realizethat two proposed appointees to the Housing Finance Review Boardwere recommended by Barry Wolfson, who provided a $350,000 campaignloan to Mecham. One of the three impeachment counts accuses thegovernor of concealing the loan.   The state Senate also voted today to lengthen daily sessions inan effort to speed it up.   The trial began Feb. 29, and senators have complained that thetrial is moving too slowly and there might not be time to reach averdict before Mecham's May 17 recall election.   They voted 21-6 to add two hours of testimony a day, subject tochange if the new eight-hour schedule proves too heavy.   The first-term Republican governor was likely to testify thisafternoon as the last defense witness on the first impeachmentcount, said his attorney, Fred Craft.   On Tuesday, a woman who claims to be the former lover ofArizona's top police officer testified that he is a liar who hadambitions to be governor.   Christina Johnston testified Tuesday that her relationship withDepartment of Public Safety Director Ralph Milstead was ``intimateand personal.''   Milstead has accused Mecham of obstructing justice by orderinghim not to cooperate with an investigation of an alleged deaththreat against a former Mecham aide who was to testify before agrand jury about the $350,000 campaign loan.   Mrs. Johnston, asked Tuesday about her opinion of Milstead'soverall truthfulness, said, ``He's a liar. He's corrupt, he's anegomaniac and he's power-hungry. I'm sorry, but that's the truth.''   Mrs. Johnston said Milstead told her in 1982 he wanted to begovernor because it was ``an easy job.''   ``It seems like everything that he does is for his own pleasureand he wants people to see that he's Tarzan,'' she said.   Milstead was in Israel attending an anti-terrorism conference,and DPS spokesman Sgt. Allan Schmidt declined to comment on Mrs.Johnston's statements. When the DPS director testified before theSenate, he said he knew her as an informant but he was not askedabout any alleged sexual relationship.   Prosecutor William French asked Mrs. Johnston only one question:``I get the impression you don't like Colonel Milstead, is thatcorrect?''   ``At this time I'm very disgusted with him,'' she replied.   In an affidavit to senators, Mrs. Johnston claimed to have hadan affair with Milstead. The trial's presiding judge, Frank X.Gordon Jr., disallowed testimony about the matter.   Gordon, the state Supreme Court's chief justice, renewed thatruling Tuesday after a lengthy exchange in which prosecutor PaulEckstein repeatedly objected to defense lawyer Fred Craft'squestioning of Mrs. Johnston.   ``Maybe I just don't understand the rules,'' Craft protested.   ``That may be a good statement,'' Gordon replied.   At one point, Mrs. Johnston contended that Milstead believed``if you don't have money or a title, you're a loser.''   Republican Sen. Peter Kay commented, ``What you've justdescribed is someone who's proud of his own achievements in life.''   Attorney A. Melvin McDonald, who represents Mecham aide RayRussell, testified Tuesday that he believed Milstead had a goodprofessional reputation.   McDonald said he was not surprised by the allegation thatthen-state official Lee Watkins had threatened the life of formerMecham aide Donna Carlson. At the time of the alleged Nov. 12threat, Ms. Carlson was about to testify before a state grand juryregarding Mecham's failure to report the campaign loan.   ``To me it was just Lee Watkins shooting his mouth off again,''McDonald said. Watkins has denied making a threat.   Mecham has acknowledged that he may have told Milstead not tocooperate with the attorney general, but the governor has insistedhe was not informed there was a serious threat that involvedpossible witness tampering.   Lt. Col. Gary Phelps, deputy director of the Department ofPublic Safety, testified today that the handling of the allegedthreat was ``very bizarre.''   ``In my perception I had one grand jury witness, Lee Watkins,threaten a second grand jury witness, Donna Carlson; we reported itto a third grand jury witness, the governor, who then asked afourth grand jury witness, Max Hawkins, to look at it,'' Phelpssaid.   He also said he did not advise Mecham on how to handle thesituation because the governor has his own advisers, including anew chief of staff who was a former U.S. attorney.   The House impeached Mecham, 63, on Feb. 5, and accused him ofattempting to block the death threat probe, concealing the $350,000campaign loan and misusing $80,000 from the governor's protocolfund by loaning it to his auto dealership.   He faces an April 21 criminal trial on charges of hiding the$350,000 loan, and a May 17 recall election.   Mecham is the first U.S. governor to be impeached in nearly sixdecades. A two-thirds vote of the 30-member Senate is required toconvict him.</TEXT></DOC>
