Gerber disclosed Thursday that it would break with the customarypractice in the infant formula business by advertising its newGerber Baby Formula in television commercials and direct mailings toparents starting in August.   The new formula, which will be manufactured by Bristol-Myers Co.,already a big player in the $1.65 billion infant formula market,will be available starting in September.   The proposed marketing approach immediately drew fire from theAmerican Association of Pediatrics, which opposes advertising infantformula to consumers for fear that it would discourage breastfeeding.   ``I'm disappointed that Gerber _ with an impeccable reputation inthe field of infant nutrition _ would resort to this tactic,'' saidDr. Joe Sanders, associate executive director of the academy, basedin Elk Grove Village, Ill.   Gerber officials said their ads would emphasize that breastfeeding is the preferred method for feeding infants. They said itwould also encourage mothers to talk with their physicians beforedeciding on a formula.   The announcement was unusual in that it links Gerber, which hastwice discontinued infant formula products, with a company that isalready a major factor in that business.   Bristol-Myers, based in New York, claims a 37 percent share ofthe market, with products including Enfamil and ProSobee.   Abbott Laboratories Inc. has about 52.3 percent of the market,while Amrican Home Products Corp. is third at 9.7 percent, accordingto Gerber's figures.   Under the agreement, Bristol-Myers will manufacture the newformula and be responsible for assuring the quality of the product,while Gerber market it.   ``Infant formula is a logical extension to our 61-year dedicationto helping parents feed babies,'' said Robert L. Johnston, head ofthe Gerber Products division at the Fremont, Mich.-based company.   Gerber makes about 180 baby food products. The formula will beavailable in powdered, concentrated liquid and ready-to-use liquidforms.   Gerber spokesman Steven Poole his company sold an infant formulacalled Modilac for about 10 years ending in the mid-1960s. It wasdiscontinued because it was too costly to make and sell at acompetitive price.   He said Gerber had also made a special formula for infants whocould not tolerate milk but discontinued it about three years ago.   Bristol-Myers spokesman Dave Dubber said his company approachedGerber about marketing a new line of formula.   ``Gerber has a food reputation in this market. We feel they havea chance to strengthen our position in the market,'' he said.   He said the Gerber product also will give Bristol-Myers anotheroutlet for formula. Bristol-Myers sells its infant formula throughpediatricians while Gerber Baby Formula will be sold in stores.   Infant formula makers have generally avoided marketing directlyto parents. But last year, Carnation Co. came out with two formulaproducts, Good Start and Good Nature, that were initially promoteddirectly to parents.   The company has quit marketing Good Start to parents, reportedlyunder pressure from pediatricians and the Food and DrugAdministration, but still markets Good Nature formula for olderbabies to parents.   Sanders of the pediatrician's group said he ``cannot help butwonder if there is a subliminal message here that says if you choosenot to breast feed, here is an alternative just as good.''   Tim Atwater, a spokesman for the Minneapolis-based advocacy groupAction for Corporate Accountability, said Gerber has a built-inconflict by advocating breast feeding while selling a substitute.   ``They will only make money when moms choose not to breastfeed,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
