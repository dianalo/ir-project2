Add bonds. Stir vigorously.   That has turned out to be a recipe for success for somemutual fund companies. So-called balanced funds, whichcombine stocks and bonds in a single portfolio, haveattracted almost $1 billion from investors this year, puttingthese funds on track for their best annual sales since 1986.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;It's one of the oldest and sleepiest areas of the fundindustry,&quot; notes Charles Vieth, manager of retail marketingat Baltimore's T. Rowe Price Associates. &quot;But just recently,it's been picking up in popularity.&quot;   T. Rowe Price launched its first balanced fund earlierthis year, partly because of hefty demand from companies with401(k) and similar retirement plans. Many investors are antsyabout the stock market, and tend to stick the bulk of theirretirement savings into bonds. By offering a conservativestock fund such as a balanced fund, companies hope toencourage employees to put at least part of their money intostocks, which generate far better returns than bonds overlonger periods of time.   Balanced fund sales are getting a boost for anotherreason. Right now, the long-term performance of these fundslooks surprisingly good compared with many of their stockfund competitors. In the 10 years ended June 30, the averagebalanced fund returned 270.1%, compared with 234.5% for fundsthat invest wholly in stocks. Balanced funds also have theedge for the past five years, 51.2% to 49.1%, according toLipper Analytical Services.   Balanced funds tend to perform well in bear markets,because their bondholdings provide a cushion against fallingshare prices. Over longer periods, however, balanced fundsshould lag behind pure stock funds, because the bonds in abalanced fund act as a drag on performance when stocks arerising.   But in recent years, things have gone swimmingly forbalanced funds. These funds typically have, say, 60% of fundassets in larger companies' stocks and 40% in top-qualitybonds with maturities of around 10 years. That mix turned outto be a potent combination over the past decade, when bluechip stocks sparkled and interest rates fell.   &quot;It's probably not a bad fund for {novice investors} tostart with,&quot; says A. Michael Lipper, president of LipperAnalytical. But he reckons that balanced funds may lose someof their luster if interest rates stagnate and smaller andmedium-sized companies continue their recent resurgence.   There's another reason to be wary of balanced funds:Hunting down a well-run fund is even trickier than picking agood stock fund. &quot;One of the problems with balanced funds isthat it's often difficult to work out what lies behind theirperformance,&quot; says Kenneth Gregory, editor of L/G No-LoadFund Analyst, a San Francisco newsletter. &quot;You've got theirbond performance, their stock performance, plus anyasset-allocation changes that have been made.&quot;   In looking for a well-run balanced fund, one strategy isto hunt for funds where the stock portfolio is managed by astock picker who has a good, clearly identifiable trackrecord. In the case of a handful of no-load balanced funds,that's pretty easy to do, because the stock portion of thesefunds is managed by portfolio managers who also runtop-performing stock funds.   Twentieth Century Balanced Fund, for instance, is managedby the same computer-driven stock pickers who are responsiblefor Twentieth Century's high-flying growth stock funds.Similarly, CGM Mutual Fund, a balanced fund, is run by topfund manager G. Kenneth Heebner. Mr. Heebner also runs CGMCapital Development, which had the fund industry's secondbest record for the 10 years ended June 30. Both the CGM fundand the Twentieth Century fund are more aggressive than thetypical balanced fund.   Among more conservative funds, there is Dodge andamp; CoxBalanced Fund, which is managed by the folks who run thetop-performing Dodge andamp; Cox Stock Fund, and Vanguard StarFund, which makes its money by buying other Vanguard stock,bond and money market funds. Included in the Vanguard fundare four stock funds, Windsor, Windsor II, Explorer andMorgan Growth.   Vanguard Star and Twentieth Century Balanced use fixedallocations when dividing their assets between stocks andbonds. These funds will rebalance the portfolio if thepercentages get out of kilter. Dodge andamp; Cox Balanced and CGMMutual Fund, on the other hand, vary the stock and bondportions depending on market conditions.   CGM, for instance, right now has 37% of fund assets inbonds. &quot;That reflects a neutral attitude towards the stockmarket,&quot; says Mr. Heebner. &quot;There have been times when we'veonly been 25% in fixed income, and other times when we'vebeen 50% in fixed income.&quot; CGM owns just 15 stocks, far fewerthan most balanced funds. The fund's biggest position isPhilip Morris, which accounts for a hefty 11% of fund assets.   With funds such as CGM Mutual and Twentieth CenturyBalanced, investors can be assured of getting stock pickerswith good track records. But that still leaves the questionof what sort of allocation the fund is using.   &quot;By buying a balanced fund, you're accepting that thefund's asset allocation is right for you,&quot; says Mr. Gregory,the newsletter editor. &quot;We believe it makes more sense to putthe pieces together yourself and create your own balancedportfolio.&quot;   Mr. Gregory suggests building your own balanced fund bycombining a top stock fund and a top bond fund. That way, hesays, you can be assured of getting fund managers with goodtrack records, plus you can control the allocation betweenthe two sectors. &quot;If I was trying to put together two fundsthat I planned to hold for the long term, I would buy anintermediate-term bond fund like the Vanguard Bond MarketFund and an equity fund like Gabelli Asset Fund or SelectedAmerican Shares,&quot; says Mr. Gregory.</TEXT></DOC>
