Monieson, wereordered banned from the futures industry and fined $500,000each, in one of the toughest actions ever by federalcommodities officials.   The closely watched case hinged on charges that GNP andMr. Monieson failed to control allegedly renegade commoditiessalesmen. If applied aggressively across the industry, thisenforcement standard could easily trip up other firms andtheir top officers.</LP><TEXT>   An administrative law judge at the Commodities FuturesTrading Commission, George H. Painter, revoked theregistrations of GNP and Mr. Monieson and barred both fromtrading on U.S. futures exchanges. Mr. Painter found that Mr.Monieson and his firm failed to stop promptly the allegedbilking of customers by some GNP salesmen.   GNP and Mr. Monieson plan to appeal, and the sanctionswill be put on hold until the full CFTC or, beyond that, thefederal courts decide the matter. If the decision is upheld,GNP would be forced out of the commodities industry. Theoverwhelming portion of the firm's revenue came from thecommodities.   One of the brokers was a close friend of Mr. Monieson, andthe judge found believable testimony that Mr. Monieson waswarned about -- and failed to stop -- the allegedly illegaltrading. Calling the small investors who were cheated&quot;virtually defenseless,&quot; Mr. Painter wrote in his 135-pageopinion: &quot;The shame of this case is that GNP and Moniesonwere so callously indifferent to the wrongs done to theirmost vulnerable customers.&quot;   The case has also received attention because of thepowerful figures who came to Mr. Monieson's defense. U.S.Agriculture Secretary Clayton Yeutter, who served as Mercpresident under Mr. Monieson, and current Merc chief LeoMelamed, both testified as character witnesses for theirfriend. Also, Jerrold E. Salzman, the Merc's powerful outsidecounsel, represented Mr. Monieson in the CFTC case.   Mr. Melamed and Mr. Salzman have said they saw no conflictof interest -- even though the Merc was pursuing nearlyidentical failure-to-supervise charges against GNP, thoughnot against Mr. Monieson -- because their friend wasn'tcharged personally by the Merc.   Former U.S. Senator Thomas F. Eagleton quit the Merc boardover the incident last November, saying Messrs. Melamed andSalzman had improperly intruded into a government enforcementaction to protect their friend. The episode showed thepotential for conflicts of interest in the industry's systemof self-regulation.   Friday, the Merc said it fined GNP $100,000 as part of asettlement with the firm over the case, and that GNP is inthe process of reimbursing about $300,000 to customers whowere hurt by the brokers' actions. GNP neither admitted nordenied guilt as part of the settlement.   The two brokers involved, Norman Furlett, the longtimefriend of Mr. Monieson, and Ira P. Greenspon, were alsobanned from the futures industry and fined $75,000 each. Thetwo earlier agreed to leave the business. Their lawyer, JamesKoch, said he hadn't seen the decision yet and declinedcomment. The two men, who live in California, have denied anywrongdoing.   They were accused of so-called trade allocation --initiating trades without the required customer accountnumber and then keeping the winners for themselves andplacing the losers in customer accounts. According tointernal Merc documents not made public, for instance, duringthe first two months of 1986, accounts they had including onenamed Horse Trading had $62,372.95 in profits. Four customeraccounts the Merc examined had for those months combinedlosses of $20,988.12.   Mr. Monieson was warned at least five times about thealleged cheating by GNP employees, the CFTC alleged. Mr.Monieson denied this, but Mr. Painter didn't believe him, hewrote in his decision. &quot;It appears that Monieson's misplacedallegiance to Furlett and Greenspon overshadowed his greaterduty to the customers they were defrauding,&quot; he wrote. Thejudge believed one GNP worker's testimony that the worker wastold the alleged cheating was allowed to go on &quot;because NormFurlett is Brian Monieson's good buddy.&quot;   Mr. Monieson has contended that he didn't know about thealleged cheating and that, as Merc chairman and head of GNP,he was too busy to know of such relatively small matters. Thetrading involved represented less than 1% of the volumehandled by GNP, which has a lot of big institutionalinvestors as clients.   &quot;The decision and sanctions are not rational,&quot; Mr.Monieson said. &quot;No firm could survive under that standard.&quot;   Mr. Monieson said GNP will stay open for business duringthe appeal process. Since the case began, he has sold offmost of GNP's so-called retail sales operations.</TEXT></DOC>
