(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Walt Disney Co. stock rose sharplyWednesday amid speculation that the entertainment kingdom might bethe next takeover target of Paramount Communications Inc.   Disney would not comment other than to say it had no informationto explain the rise.   The stock, up more than $7 at one point from Tuesday's close,finished up $4.75 at $109.12{ a share in New York Stock Exchangetrading.   A group led by Sid Bass, one of the Fort Worth, Texas, family ofinvestors, owns about 16 percent of Disney's shares, but thatholding has been described as long-term and amicable. There was nocomment from the Bass group Wednesday.   The Bass family in 1984 spent $333 million and took a 25 percentshare of Disney stock to help the company ward off hostile takeoverattempts by financiers Saul Steinberg of New York and Irwin Jacobsof Minneapolis.   However, there has been market speculation that the Bass groupmight sell its holdings to Paramount, which on Monday dropped its$12.2 billion hostile bid for Time Inc.   New York-based Paramount, which built itself into a media andentertainment conglomerate largely through acquisitions, indicatedMonday that it would pursue other acquisitions or ventures afterlosing a Delaware court battle seeking to block Time's acquisitionof Warner Communications Inc.   But some analysts consider Disney, which in May reported itsprofit for the first half of the fiscal year was up 35 percent at$297.3 million, an unlikely target for a takeover bid.   Considered by some to be a more likely trigger for thespeculation was anticipation of a third quarter report thatanalysts estimate would show earnings of $1.40 a share, comparedwith $1.20 a share for the same period last year.</TEXT></DOC>
