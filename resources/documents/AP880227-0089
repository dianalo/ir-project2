WELCH</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Gary Hart today dispelled rumors that he wouldend his presidential campaign, saying he was remaining in theDemocratic race, although acknowledging he has little chance ofwinning.   ``I came back into this race and intend to stay in this racebecause the Democratic Party must have a voice for reform andchange,'' Hart said at a news conference this morning.   Hart, who dropped out of the race and re-entered it last yearsaying he wanted to ``let the people decide,'' told reporters todaythat ``I've heard from the voters. I want to hear from a few more,but I understand the message.''   Hart said his chances of winning the Democratic presidentialnomination were ``remote, to say the least.''   Under these political circumstances, Hart said he normally wouldhave decided to quit the race, but he added that ``I don't thinkthese are normal times.''   Hart issued a schedule of campaign stops and speeches around theSouth between now and March 4.   Questions had arisen over whether Hart was planning to announcehe was withdrawing from the race but aides to the former Coloradosenator said earlier that he was going to stay.   ``He is having a news conference. He's not dropping out of therace,'' Bobbie McCallum, Hart's liaison at his Denver campaignheadquarters, said Friday.   The five other Democratic contenders were in Atlanta for aGeorgia state Democratic Party dinner on Friday. Hart did notattend the dinner but arrived in Atlanta late Friday and wasscheduled to participate in a Democratic debate there later today.   Hart's campaign has failed to catch fire since he re-entered therace in December after dropping out the previous May amid questionsabout his relationship with model Donna Rice. He had been theundisputed front-runner before he quit the race.   In rejoining the race, Hart said he came back because ``I havethe power of ideas and I can govern this country.''   After finishing dead last among Democrats in the New Hampshireprimary earlier this month, Hart vowed to remain in the racedespite his poor showing.   Hart made an unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidentialnomination in 1984.</TEXT></DOC>
