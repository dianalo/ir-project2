In addition,the elemental compostion of SPM was established with respect to heavymetal. Nitrogen monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and sulphur dioxide were monitoredas half hour mean values at one station in the towns and at two stationsin the Greater Copenhagen Area. On the basis of the data collected in1986 data evaluation was carried out in accordance with the followingguidelines. 1. Assessment of the air pollution level in the seven Danishcities in relation to Danish or international limit values or guide lines.2. Qualitative estimate of the origin of the air pollution. 3. Surveyof the data with respect to the subsequent data analysis and discoveryof air pollution problems. 4. Estimate of the trend of the air quality.An evaluation of the air quality data from 1986 showed as earlier noviolation of existing or proposed limit values in Denmark or in the EEC-countriesfor sulphur dioxide, SPM, lead or nitrogen oxides. The EEC-guide lineof nitrogendioxide on 50 ug/m3 as annual mean and 135 ug/m3 as 98-percentileswas violated in Copenhagen at H.C. Andersens Boulevard. The measuredannual mean concentrations of SPM were generally half the EEC-limit valueof annual mean. Finally, the measured mean concentrations of lead atthe most busy streets were approximately 1/4 of the EEC-limit value ofannual mean on 2 ug/m3. The annual averages of lead have since 1982 beendecreasing with more than a factor of two. Based on data from the period1982-1986 the trends have been evaluated. The lead concentration decreasedmore than a factor of two in the period. The nitrogen dioxide concentrationincreased in most urban areas at locations with high traffic density.Other components did not show any general trend i.e. less than 5% peryear. (EG).</TEXT></DOC>
