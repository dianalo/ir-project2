Bishop L. Robinson, the secretary of public safety andcorrectional services, pulled out the guns to illustrate how easilythey could be concealed, stunning guests invited to Gov. WilliamDonald Schaefer's fund-raising breakfast Friday morning.   ``My God, it was so dramatic,'' said Harold C. Donofrio, anadvertising executive. ``Bishop does not dress in loose clothing.... Not a bulge anywhere.   ``All of a sudden, he gets a gun from inside his belt, and thenext thing you know he's got this thing in the palm of his hand. Hepasses that one off to someone, reaches somewhere else and getsanother gun,'' Donofrio said.   Schaefer invited 40 supporters to the private breakfast to raisefunds to back Maryland's handgun control bill, the first of itskind in the nation, whose fate will be decided in a referendum onthe Nov. 8 ballot.   After Robinson's demonstration, they came up with on-the-spotpledges of an estimated $75,000 to $100,000 to help support thebill.   Schaefer signed the bill, which seeks to ban the sale of cheaphandguns known as Saturday Night Specials, in May.   However, a group called the Maryland Committee Against the GunBan, with support from the National Rifle Association, conducted avigorous campaign to repeal the law, submitting enough petitionsignatures to bring the issue before state voters.   Critics contend the law could lead to a ban on the sale of allnew handguns. Defenders say it will only affect cheaply madeSaturday Night Specials.   Bruce C. Bereano, a top state lobbyist and supporter of the gunbill, said the breakfast was a signal that from the governor'sstandpoint the campaign to save the bill ``is going to be todusporkus _ whole hog.''</TEXT></DOC>
