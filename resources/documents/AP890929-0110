Alitalia received permission for a route for the papal planeover Yugoslavia, Hungary, the Soviet Union and Japan for the Oct. 6flight to Seoul, South Korea, the first stop on the 10-day trip,said Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro.   The Italian flag airline announced last month that China'sCommunist government denied permission for the papal plane tooverfly China. China did not give an explanation.   China severed diplomatic relations with the Vatican in 1957 andallows worship only under the guise of the Chinese PatrioticCatholic Church, which consecrates its own bishops.   Historically poor Soviet-Vatican relations have improvedconsiderably in the past year, and Soviet President Mikhail S.Gorbachev is expected to meet with John Paul at the Vatican when hevisits Italy in November.   By overflying the Soviet Union, Alitalia avoids the longer polarroute.   After Seoul, the pope will visit Indonesia and Mauritius beforereturning to Rome on Oct. 16.</TEXT></DOC>
