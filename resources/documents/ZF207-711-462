(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>True BASIC is not a fully Microsoft-compatible dialect of BASIC.andP;  But thenagain, GW-BASIC doesn't offer the many enhancements to be found in True BASICeither.andP;  The $99.95 True BASIC has evolved at a far more leisurely pace, andthis shows in the more elegant look and feel of its command set.andO;Furthermore, it alone can claim direct descent from the very first BASIC,developed 25 years ago by Dartmouth professors John G.andP;  Kemeny and Thomas E.andO;Kunz.andM;Actually, True BASIC is an implementation of the formal definition of BASICdeveloped by the American National Standards Institute in the mid-1980s, inwhich process Messrs.andP;  Kemeny and Kurtz played a substantial role; a fewadded features also go beyond the ANSI spec.andP;  Some of the features willintrigue those raised on the ubiquitous Microsoft interpreter.andM;Whereas in GW-BASIC, arrays must start with element 0 or 1, arrays in TrueBASIC can be &quot;biased&quot;: a statement like &quot;DIM YEARS(1900 TO 1999)&quot; defines anarray with 100 elements, the first of which is number 1900.andP;  To extractsubstrings in GW-BASIC, the MID$ (&quot;string&quot;, s, e) function is used, where sis the starting position and e the ending.andP;  True BASIC instead offers themore-compact notation &quot;string&quot;[s:e]; thus &quot;BASIC&quot;[2:3] refers to thesubstring &quot;AS&quot;.andP;  And where GW-BASIC lets you output edited numbers with thePRINT USING statement, True BASIC lets you assign an edited number to astring with the USING$(format$, expr1, expr2, .andP;  .  .  ) function, afterwhich you can continue to work with it inside the program .andM;GW-BASIC has no matrix functions and only poorly thought-out graphicsfunctions.andP;  True BASIC has a full complement of matrix functions groupedunder the MAT command, and rich graphics functions are available under theBOX command .andP;  True BASIC approaches the objectoriented style of programmingwhen it allows modifiers on the &quot;DRAW picturesubroutine&quot; command that shift,scale, rotate, or shear the output of the named picture-generatingsubroutine.andM;Powerful facilities in the True BASIC environment include a command-driveneditor that can display all instances of a particular string and do a globalchange with confirm ation.andP;  The dialect offers editable script files that canstore sequences of commands to be executed and, like DOS batch files, takearguments; one of these files is STARTUP.andP;  TRU, which True BASIC executes atstart-up.andM;FOLLOWS OWN STANDARDandM;Some deviations from the Microsoft dialect will take getting used to if youwere raised on GW-BASIC.andP;  The LOAD command, for instance, is called OLD; theSYSTEM command is BYE; KILL is UNSAVE.andP;  The MKDIR and RMDIR commands aregone, possibly to make True BASIC less DOS-dependent, since True BASICprograms run on Amigas, Atari STs, and Macs, as well as on PCs.andM;And syntax characters that no longer have the meaning you may expect includethe apostrophe (which preceded comments in the original BASIC dialect), theplus sign (used for string concatenation), and the period (used to segmentvariable names).andP;  A large cursor now indicates replace mode, the .BASextension is now .TRU, and neither integers nor doubleprecisionfloating-point numbers are supported.andM;True BASI&quot;compiles&quot; your source into pseudocode rather than actual machinelanguage, and the .EXE file it builds packages this pseudocode with its ownruntime interpreter.andP;  Fortunately, there is no runtime charge, as there oftenis with many other language products.andM;Communications support is omitted from the base product but available as aseparate $69 toolkit.andP;  Other kits include Sorting and Searching, FormsManage- ment, 3-D Graphics, Business Graphics, Scientific Graphics,Mathematics (with support for real numbers of up to 100,000 digits), AdvancedString Manipulation, and an IBM PC developer's toolkit.andP;  The kits are 90percent True BASIC source code, with the other 10 percent being highlyoptimized assembler code.andM;The latest release of True BASIC, Version 2.1, contains a number of importantimprovements, such as VGA support, a more powerful TRACE command, andcompletely rewritten documentation, but it still costs only $99.95.andM;If True BASIC were a business BASIC aiming for a different market than thatcurrently dominated by Microsoft, the product might indeed be a major force.andO;True BASIC, however, faces an uphill baffle from its very compliance withANSIwhose vision for the language has not matched the present abilities ofMicrosoft's product.andP;  Yet True BASIC excels in specific areas that remainuntouched by the more popular products.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
