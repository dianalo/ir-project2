The settlement with the firm, which is expected to be announced this week, is a sign that the government investigation of the &quot;Yuppie Five&quot; insider-trading case is coming to a climax, following a prolonged internal struggle over the case within the SEC's New York regional office. Charges against several individual Wall Street arbitragers in the case are likely, according to the people familiar with the government investigation.    The people said that the Schloss firm has agreed to settle SEC civil charges of insider trading, without admitting or denying guilt, and to disgorge allegedly illegal trading profits totaling between $100,000 and $150,000 plus additional penalties. The government has been investigating trading by the firm in stocks including Avondale Mills, American Brands Inc. and Union Carbide Corp. The firm also will accept a censure by the SEC, the people said.    An attorney for the Schloss firm, Robert J. Katz, a partner in the law firm of Sullivan andamp; Cromwell, declined to comment, as did an SEC spokeswoman in Washington.    Since 1986, the Schloss firm has been a focus of the government investigation in the Yuppie Five case, in which the SEC's New York office broke up an insider-trading ring that included young lawyers and investment bankers. Last year, Kathleen Warwick, then head of the SEC's New York office, tabled an &quot;action memo&quot; by her staff recommending that the SEC bring charges in the case. Miss Warwick's action fueled dissension within the New York enforcement group that ultimately led to her resignation last fall.    The SEC charges against the Schloss firm involve its arbitrage, or takeover-stock speculation, activities. The investigation wasn't related to the firm's specialist, or market-making, role on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange.    Andrew Solomon, a former securities analyst at Marcus Schloss, pleaded guilty in 1986 to trading on inside information for the firm; Mr. Solomon said at the time of his plea that senior Schloss officials were aware of his trading. The continuing SEC investigation has focused on several Wall Street arbitragers, including Ronald Yagoda, a former principal and head of trading at Schloss, and Victor Teicher, formerly an arbitrager at Edward A. Viner andamp; Co. who now runs his own firm.    Mr. Yagoda is not part of the SEC settlement with the Schloss firm and could face SEC civil charges in the case, according to people familiar with the investigation. If he is charged, he is expected to fight the charges in court, sources said.    Stanley S. Arkin, Mr. Yagoda's attorney, declined to comment, as did Robert Morvillo, the lawyer for Mr. Teicher.    Lawyers familiar with securities-law cases said that the Schloss firm was under heavy pressure to settle with the SEC because of Mr. Solomon's guilty plea. They said that the firm, as Mr. Solomon's employer, was legally responsible for his conduct.    The Yuppie Five case is also the subject of a federal grand jury investigation.    Mr. Solomon and three other young professionals pleaded guilty to using information stolen from the New York law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton andamp; Garrison by Michael W. David, a former Paul Weiss associate who also pleaded guilty in the case. </TEXT></DOC>
