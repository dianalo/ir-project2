(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The policy-making body of the Assembliesof God will resolve an unprecedented rift between national andstate church leaders over the punishment of fallen TV evangelistJimmy Swaggart, a spokeswoman says.   ``This will be a final decision with no right of appeals,'' saidJuleen Turnage, Assemblies secretary of information. ``Ourexecutives feel that this is a situation that needs to be ...expedited quickly.''   G. Raymond Carlson, the general superintendent of thePentecostal denomination based here, said in a statement Thursdaythat the General Presybtery would meet March 28 to make a decision.   Meanwhile, in New Orleans, three state appeals court judgesheard arguments on whether they should revive a $90 million lawsuitfiled against Swaggart by a preacher he accused of adultery.   A lawyer for preacher Marvin Gorman said evidence gathered byprivate detectives who investigated Swaggart will be made public incourt if the lawsuit is reinstated. If the judges refuse to revivethe suit, attorney Thomas Frasier said, the evidence will be madepublic in some other manner.   The judges gave no indication when they would rule.   Swaggart, a Baton Rouge, La., evangelist with a $150 millionempire and a worldwide television following, confessed toundisclosed sins after reports linked him to prostitutes.   Swaggart has admitted sinning against his wife, but has not goneinto detail. What others are saying he has done, depending on thespecifics, might best be described as voyeurism, sexual perversionor pornographic acts.   An investigation to determine if Swaggart can keep hisministerial credentials has grown into a circle of meetings withthe Louisiana District Council and the Executive Presbyterydebating his punishment.   The Louisiana officials recommended Swaggart be suspended fromthe pulpit for three months, but national leaders have said such ashort suspension for a minister who has confessed to moralmisconduct would be unprecedented.   National officials asked the state leaders to reconsider theirrecommendation, but in another unprecedented move, the staterefused.   Mrs. Turnage said the executives had hoped to have the March 28meeting earlier, but previous commitments by some of the 250General Presybters prevented it. The General Presbytery meetsannually, usually in August.   The General Presbytery consists of the 13 executive presbyters,representatives of the Assemblies' districts, foreign missions andcolleges and honorary members. It is described as the policy-makingbody for the church and serves as the court of appeals onministerial credentials.   Only once within the last 25 years has it convened in specialsession to deal with a church matter. The matter then was thefounding of Evangel College in Springfield, Mrs. Turnage said.   ``The majority vote prevails,'' she said. ``The only item on theagenda is Jimmy Swaggart. They will have open discussion and a votewill be taken.''   She said the presbyters can request that Swaggart attend themeeting, ``but at this time, that point has not been discussed.''   Mrs. Turnage said figures will not be available for anotherthree weeks to determine whether the Swaggart situation has had anyeffect on contributions to the nation's largest Pentecostaldenomination.   Last year following the PTL scandal, contributions rose 6percent, and the Assemblies gained more church members andchurches, she said.</TEXT></DOC>
