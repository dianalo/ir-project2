Many compounds of this type are described well by densityfunctional theory, but several are not. The results of fully relativisticself-consistent density functional calculations using the LMTO methodare presented for the materials USi{sub 3}, USn{sub 3} and URu{sub 3}.In the light of these results the applicability of band theory to thesematerials is discussed, and an indication given of how this correlateswith the position of the non-uranium atom in the Periodic Table. Theimportance of the f band width and the details of the hybridisation betweenuranium f states and non-f states on neighbouring sites are emphasised.</TEXT></DOC>
