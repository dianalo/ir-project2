The Energy Department has spent the past two weeks defending its hands-off management of the Aiken, S.C., Savannah River nuclear weapons plant, where a reactor was shut down in August, because workers were unable to account for its sudden power surge. Since then, department officials have been chastised in Congress for being uninformed about events that led to that accident and others, including one at the Rocky Flats, Colo., plutonium plant that resulted in its shutdown last week.    But as laid out in a recent federal court motion, the Energy Department claims to have been scrutinizing the problems all along -- at least at the Fernald, Ohio, plant, where it said that for 34 years it specifically directed a contractor to store radioactive waste in corroding steel drums and in sewers and waste pits that the contractor said all along violated safety standards.    Under a recent Supreme Court ruling, if the department takes the blame for the poor conditions at the plant, it will absolve the contractor, NL Industries Inc.'s NLO Inc. unit, from any claims -- and free itself from any judgment costs, because it indemnified NLO.    The Energy Department &quot;has done a 180-degree turnaround,&quot; said Stanley Chelsey, who represents 14,000 Ohio residents in a 1986 class-action suit against NLO. &quot;For four years, (the Energy Department) claimed that they didn't know anything about what the contractor was doing.&quot;    The disclosure came in a motion for summary judgment in the suit, which alleges that NLO allowed radioactive material to leak on and off the 1,050-acre Fernald plant site. The suit seeks $300 million in damages for diminution of property value and for emotional trauma caused by leaks of radioactive material into air and water. The suit and the motion were filed in federal court in the Southern District of Ohio.    The self-critical tone of the Energy Department's motion reflects the agency's immunity from suit. &quot;In undertaking this project, the government knew full well that the normal operation of the Fernald Plant would result in emissions of uranium and other substances,&quot; it reads. &quot;In fact, the Atomic Energy Commission had the plant designed and built with a pipeline to carry uranium in waste water from the plant to be diluted in the Great Miami River.&quot; The Atomic Energy Commission was the precursor of the Energy Department.    NLO, according to the motion, warned the Energy Department &quot;time and again&quot; against constructing pits for radioactive waste at the site, and of the need for waste-treatment facilities, starting in 1952. &quot;Finally, in 1986, DOE provided funds for waste treatment,&quot; the department said.    Fernald, like Savannah River and other Energy Department facilities, faces staggering environmental and safety problems. A July report by the General Accounting Office rated safety at that facility &quot;marginal.&quot; Groundwater contamination by radioactive material is hundreds of times greater than drinking-water standards permit and has spread to off-site wells, according to the GAO, which estimated that it will cost about $500 million to upgrade the plant. Westinghouse Electric Corp. took over management of Fernald in 1986 and has begun a clean-up program there.    Hearings on the lawsuit and the department's responsibility for the state of the Fernald plant will be held today before a House committee, at the request of Rep. Donald E. Lukens (R., Ohio). </TEXT></DOC>
