If the averagebeam angular momentum per particle is small compared to the correspondingrms value, this dependence disappears. If incident and final angularmomenta for a cell have the same magnitude, there will be no emittancegrowth in that cell associated with charge transfer even though the signof the angular momentum is reversed. Utilization of this effect to reduceemittance growth due to double charge exchange in two separated cellsrequires either a specially shaped magnetic field at the neutralizercell or a beam transit time through the initial charge neutralizationcell appreciably less than the cyclotron period of the beam in the cell.The length of the focusing region in a neutralizer cell can be increasedby shaping its associated magnetic field. The consequent reduction inbeam degradation for beams neutralized over that extended region is afunction of the initial beam divergence and size separately and not solelya function of initial emittance.</TEXT></DOC>
