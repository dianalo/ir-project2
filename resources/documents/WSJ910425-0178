The law would replacethe widely varying tax packages many cities and provincesoffer to lure foreign investment.   National People's Congress approval is expected and themeasure could take effect July 1.   The proposal sets the tax rate for most foreign concernsand ventures at 30%, with a reduction to 15% for those in thefive special economic zones or technology development zones,or those doing infrastructure projects. It provides for otherspecial treatment, but requires central government approval.Companies also will have to pay a 3% local income tax.   The draft law is part of a wider central government effortto establish control over tax rates and revenues. Some localgovernments, which handle tax collection, have offeredreductions, and others have imposed taxes on their own.                                                                                                          BRITON FREED FROM IRANIAN JAIL                                                                                                          A British businessman, Roger Cooper, arrived home afterspending five years in an Iranian prison on espionagecharges. Mr. Cooper, 55 years old, was freed late Mondaynight. Tehran radio said he had been deported. The oilmarketing executive was arrested allegedly for overstayinghis visa, later convicted of spying and sentenced both todeath and a 10-year jail term. He said his confession onIranian television was coerced and contrived.                                                                                                          MOSCOW RATIFIES GERMAN PACTS                                                                                                          The Soviet Union put the final legal seal on Germanunification by ratifying two accords on the withdrawal of theKremlin's soldiers from what used to be Communist EastGermany. The pacts, ratified earlier by Bonn, commit Moscowto pull its 370,000 troops and their families out of easternGermany by 1994 and provide for financial compensation fromthe recently united Germany. Moscow earlier cleared a treatythat abolished occupiers' rights in divided Germany of theWorld War II allied victors, the U.S., U.S.S.R., France andBritain.                                                                                                          WORLD AIDS TOLL INCREASES                                                                                                          The world-wide tally of acquired immune deficiencysyndrome cases in the first quarter, reported from 162countries, jumped 9.8% to 345,533, compared with the previousquarter, the World Health Organization said in Geneva. Manynations underreport their AIDS figures, WHO said, adding thatit believes the total could be about 1.3 million.                                                                                                          NATO MARKS AN ANNIVERSARY                                                                                                          North Atlantic Treaty Organization leaders marked the 40thanniversary of the integrated military command in Europe, setup two years after NATO was formed. They welcomed the end ofthe Cold War but urged the U.S. and Canada to stick with thealliance in an uncertain future. They said NATO, given theWarsaw Pact's military dismantling, should help its formerfoes overcome any vulnerability and isolation, and adaptitself to solving crises on short notice.                                                                                                          CUBA TIGHTENS MEDICINE CONTROL                                                                                                          In the latest symptom of its worsening economic crisis,Cuba tightened control over distribution of medicines,reducing availability, raising prices and restrictingprescription rules, to offset supply problems as part ofHavana's austerity program. Cuba has one of the most advancedhealth systems in the Third World. Political and economicturmoil in the Soviet Union is disrupting supplies to Cuba ofimportant raw materials such as wood and steel, PresidentFidel Castro said.                                                                                                          BLACKLIST BY SAUDI BANKS?                                                                                                          Saudi Arabian banks have drawn up a blacklist of sixforeign institutions termed the &quot;worst offenders&quot; in cuttingtheir dealings with the region during the Persian Gulfcrisis, banking sources said.   They informally agreed to restrict their dealings with thesix in retaliation for allegedly refusing to deal with theSaudi banks, the sources said. The six were identified asTokai Bank and Sanwa Bank of Japan; Royal Bank of Canada andBank of Montreal; and International Commercial Bank of Chinaand Bank of Taiwan, both of Taiwan. The two Japanese banksand Bank of Montreal denied allegations they refused to dealwith Saudi financial institutions during the war; Royal Banksaid it hadn't been notified of any blacklisting. The SaudiArabian Monetary Agency is said to have informally sanctionedthe blacklist, but agency officials denied any link.   Saudi banks won't place deposits with the six institutionsor act as counter-parties in foreign-exchange transactions,the sources said. They also will refuse to confirm letters ofcredit issued by the six, thus limiting their ability tofinance trade with Saudi Arabia.   Many institutions cut their Mideast-dealings last year,fearful of the disruption caused by Iraq's invasion ofKuwait.

China has confiscated the licenses of two lawyers andpunished another by denying him state housing, in retaliationfor their defense of prominent dissidents, friends of thedefendants said. Separately, an official said Beijing courtsalone tried more than 700 people linked to the 1989prodemocracy campaign. . . .
