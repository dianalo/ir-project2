Richard Celeste demanded Tuesdaythat President Reagan shut down a government-owned uraniumprocessing plant until something is done to stop the radioactivepollution it produces.   The U.S. Department of Energy admitted Friday at a congressionalcommittee hearing in Washington that the government has known ofdangerous environmental problems at the Feed Materials ProductionCenter since it was established in 1951, Celeste said.   The governor said he wrote a letter to Reagan demanding that theplant, located in Fernald about 18 miles northwest of Cincinnati,be closed. The plant processes uranium for use in nuclear weapons,which are made elsewhere.   ``This admission of deceit and mismanagement confirms andemphasizes what we have known in Ohio for a long time: Thisfacility is an environmental disaster threatening the health andsafety of thousands of Ohioans,'' Celeste wrote.   The letter demands that the Energy Department, which owns theplant, pay for an independent evaluation of plant employees andnearby residents to determine how their health has been affected.   The governor also said the department should treat and stabilizeradioactive thorium at the plant; begin a final cleanup ofradioactive waste stored in two deteriorating concrete silos; andstart identifying the contents of 200,000 containers of waste thathave accumulated as a result of what the governor said is thedepartment's negligent management of the plant.   Celeste and Richard Shank, director of the Ohio EnvironmentalProtection Agency, said they believe the plant has been bettermanaged since Westinghouse Materials Co. of Ohio took over itsoperation in January 1986. But they said they are concerned aboutmore than 30 years of radioactive emissions into the atmosphere andinto the water table.   The Energy Department admitted in January 1985 that faultyexhaust air filters at the plant had allowed the release of atleast 200,000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust into theatmosphere during the past three decades, including at least 3,000pounds from 1980 to 1985.   Five people who live near the plant then filed a $300 million,class-action lawsuit alleging that the former operator, NationalLead Co., was negligent in failing to prevent the uranium releasesand that the releases contaminated property and may have causedhealth and personal injuries.   The lawsuit is pending in U.S. District Court in Cincinnati.   The Energy Department prompted the new furor by admitting incourt documents that government officials had been aware ofpotential environmental problems at the plant, but still directedNational Lead managers to proceed with uranium processing.   The state sued the Energy Department in 1985, charging it withpolluting the environment at the 1,050-acre site. That lawsuit alsois pending in U.S. District Court.   Celeste said the state, which tried to negotiate with the EnergyDepartment for a cleanup, received no cooperation until the lawsuitwas filed.   ``When Ohio's concern about conditions at the facility led thestate to attempt to become involved, the door was repeatedlyslammed in our faces. Essentially, we have been told that thismajor threat to public health and safety is none of our business,''Celeste said in the letter.   James Reafsnyder, the Energy Department's site manager, declinedcomment Tuesday and referred queries to spokeswoman Gail Bradshawin Washington. She was unavailable for calls.   Pat Weber, a White House spokeswoman for Reagan, said the EnergyDepartment already has begun what is billed as a $500 million,decade-long project to clean up and modernize the plant.</TEXT></DOC>
