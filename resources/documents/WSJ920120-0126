And he hasdevoted his life to setting it right.   Dinosaurs, insists the 46-year-old paleontologist andmuseum curator at the University of Colorado, weren'tcoldblooded, lizard-like behemoths that lumbered across theland and wallowed in swamps. Contrary to popular belief, manywere warm-blooded creatures with colorful skins, and they ranlike cheetahs.</LP><TEXT>   If that isn't radical enough for you, consider Mr.Bakker's reason for crawling around on a wind-swept, treelessbluff here in the high plains of southern Wyoming: He issearching for clues to disprove one of science's mostcurrently popular theories -- that dinosaurs were wiped outen masse after an asteroid fell, suddenly changing theearth's climate for the colder.   Mr. Bakker's theory? They were done in because they likedto travel too much.   It's just another day at the office for the enfantterrible of paleontology, whose whole life seems bent onirking the scientific establishment. Most scientists speakcautiously, in terms like &quot;the evidence suggests.&quot; The brashMr. Bakker proclaims his theories with an air of certainty.Other archaeological expeditions are larded with Ph.D.s andgraduate students from prestigious institutions; Mr. Bakkermans his with amateurs he refers to as &quot;Mesozoicbird-watchers.&quot; (Mr. Bakker, himself, is equipped with allthe usual, impressive credentials, including a Harvarddoctorate.) While most paleontologists ship their discoveriesto far-off Eastern universities for study and storage, Mr.Bakker helps local towns build museums to house fossils foundclose at hand.   But though some of his peers dismiss his theories -- andmany abhor his style -- few deny that he is roiling theprehistoric waters. Mr. Bakker's theories are discussed incollege classes, in textbooks and encyclopedias asalternative views of Mesozoic life. &quot;Before Bakker camealong, dinosaurs looked like extinct old bones,&quot; says SankarChatterjee of Texas Tech University. &quot;With Bakker, dinosaursbecame vibrant, living beings.&quot; Well, in a manner ofspeaking.   How he accomplished that is a sore subject in the science-- so sore, in fact, that some of his peers won't talk abouthim. Others complain that he is a showboat, promoting hisnotions in the popular press and on TV, not just before theyhave been accepted by the paleontology establishment, but, insome cases, even before they have been published in ascientific journal.   Mr. Bakker is clearly annoyed by the criticism. &quot;If I seemaggressive,&quot; he says, &quot;it's because sometimes one getsimpatient with orthodoxy.&quot;   But Mr. Bakker doesn't spend all his time romancing themedia. Mostly, he spends it trying to prove his extinctiontheory, which means long hours painstakingly combing the dirthere on Como Bluff for bones.   On a current dig, the paleontologist is pushing dirtaround a gray mound with his fingers as his long, kinky hairdrags in the dust and his jeans get dirtier. A few hundredyards away, James Siegwarth, a physicist with thegovernment's National Institute of Standards and Technology,is digging out the vertebra of a huge allosaur, a two-tonmeat-eater of the Jurassic era, after two days of carefullyprodding the dirt with tiny ice picks and paintbrushes. Hiswork isn't over: It can take up to 200 hours in the lab justto clean the big bone. &quot;I don't mind,&quot; he says. &quot;I guess Ilike playing in the dirt.&quot;   In the summer of 1990, Mr. Siegwarth and another dinosaurbuff, Jim Filla, spotted some tiny bones sticking out of themudstone here. And, though at least one paleontologist theyapproached wasn't interested, when they took the bones to Mr.Bakker, he promptly declared the find a new species ofdinosaur, named it Drinker (after the early paleontologistEdward Drinker Cope), and recruited Messrs. Siegwarth andFilla for a new dig at Como, which had been considered aplayed-out site. Since then, the &quot;Como Irregulars,&quot; as Mr.Bakker calls them, have unearthed more than half a dozenheretofore-undiscovered dinosaurs, with, he hopes, more tocome. &quot;I want to find a voracious, small-minded predator andname it after the IRS,&quot; Mr. Bakker says.   Mr. Bakker wishes more amateurs would join the hunt. &quot;Weneed 10 times, 100 times more weekenders,&quot; he says. &quot;Thereason the world knows so much about birds is because thereare thousands of amateur bird-watchers. The reason we know solittle about dinosaurs is there are too few people lookingfor them.&quot;   He blames the shortage on pretentious paleontologists whoinsist on calling an eye socket &quot;the fossa orbital&quot; and whogenerally look down at enthusiastic amateurs. &quot;My science islow-tech, and it requires sharp eyes and delicate fingers,&quot;not a knowledge of Latin, says Mr. Bakker. &quot;Ph.D.s are a deadloss,&quot; he adds. &quot;They break things.&quot;   With his weekenders, Mr. Bakker hopes to prove thatdinosaurs didn't die from an asteroid collision. Supportersof the much-in-vogue asteroid theory argue that a layer ofiridium separating rocks of the Cretaceous and Tertiaryperiods was left by an asteroid whose impact created anuclear winter-like climatic disaster. That wiped out manyspecies, including the dinosaurs, says physicist WalterAlvarez, whose theory this is. His argument: Dinosaurs arefound in rocks laid down before the iridium was deposited,but not afterward.   But that doesn't make sense to Mr. Bakker, who contendsthat bones would have been found on top of the iridium if thedinosaurs died after the asteroid collision. And why did thesmall and delicate frogs and toads survive the cold anddrought while bigger beasts didn't? Frogs should have bit thedust first, he says.   Mr. Bakker's theory is based on the ebb and flow of earlyseas. Paleontologists have documented several dinosaurextinctions in the Mesozoic Era that coincide with periods ofshrinking seas. When the seas ebbed between the Jurassic andCretaceous periods, for example, most dinosaurs, includingthe brontosaurs, were wiped out. Mr. Bakker calls thatextinction the &quot;dinosaur midlife crisis.&quot;   Mr. Bakker points out that each time the seas receded,land bridges appeared. Over those bridges, the largest andmost mobile dinosaurs wandered into new territory searchingfor food. They also found exotic and deadly new diseases, Mr.Bakker argues. Itinerant dinosaurs carried new diseases toalien lands, causing epidemics.   The bones of the Drinker dinosaur in the rocks at ComoBluff helped him form this theory. The Drinker apparently wasone of the few species to survive the Jurassic. &quot;The oldmoney crowd, the brontosaurs, are damn rare here,&quot; says Mr.Bakker, waving his arm over the layer where Drinker boneshave been found. Drinker survived, he believes, because itwas small -- about the size of a turkey -- and thus couldn'twander far. Neither could frogs and toads.   In an effort to win skeptical colleagues over to hisnotions, Mr. Bakker plans a blitz of papers, which heillustrates himself. But no matter how his extinction theoryis received, he plans to continue his quest to alter theworld's vision of the prehistoric world. Dinosaur orthodoxy,he says, was &quot;100% wrong when I was growing up. Now it's onlyhalf wrong.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
