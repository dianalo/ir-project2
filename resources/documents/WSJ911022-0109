Jerry Brown of Californiaopened his campaign for the Democratic presidentialnomination by asking voters to join him in a rebellionagainst &quot;a confederacy of corruption, careerism and campaignconsultants.&quot;   Standing in the shadow of Independence Hall, the53-year-old Mr. Brown accused elected politicians of takingpart in &quot;an unholy alliance of private greed and corruptpolitics&quot; that threatens to destroy the country's democraticprocess.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Brown, himself a veteran politician, says he will runhis third presidential campaign as an anti-incumbentoutsider, taking no campaign gifts of more than $100.   Blazing away at Democrats and Republicans alike, Mr. Brownsaid, &quot;The insatiable appetite for campaign dollars hasturned the government into a stop-and-shop for everyconceivable greedy and narrow interest in the country.&quot;   Mr. Brown, the son of former California Gov. Edmund &quot;Pat&quot;Brown, was first elected to office in 1969 -- as a trustee ofa community-college board in Los Angeles. He was electedCalifornia's secretary of state the following year. He waselected governor in 1974 and 1978. He ran for president in1976 and again in 1980. He also made an unsuccessful run forthe U.S. Senate in 1982. From 1989 until this March, he waschairman of the California Democratic Party, workingfuriously to collect big campaign checks from the same peopleand organizations he now denounces.   &quot;That was then,&quot; he has said. &quot;This is now.&quot;   Guided by Patrick Caddell, Jimmy Carter's pollster, Mr.Brown seeks to blame the nation's ills -- a sagging economy,crime and drugs in the inner-cities, eroding common values --on politicians from both parties who have turned to wealthypatrons, lobbyists and political-action committees for the&quot;incredible sums&quot; they need &quot;to secure careers of unlimitedtenure.&quot;   &quot;Together,&quot; he told a small but enthusiastic crowd in thesquare behind Independence Hall, &quot;private greed and corruptpower have launched a deadly assault on our common values.&quot;   Echoing George Wallace's complaint that &quot;there's not adime's worth of difference&quot; between Democrats andRepublicans, Mr. Brown said there is only one party left inAmerica -- &quot;the incumbent party.&quot; Noting that he favorslimits on the number of years politicians can hold office, hesaid, &quot;It is time for them to go.&quot;   He conceded that most &quot;experts say I cannot win. They saythat a campaign based on broad participation and $100contributions is not serious.&quot; But, he shouted, against theseexperts' skepticism &quot;we have something stronger -- thestrength of countless hands.&quot; He calls his campaign &quot;We, thePeople&quot; and has an 800-number for people to sign up.   Mr. Brown is the sixth Democrat to announce his formalcandidacy. Two others -- Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York andJesse Jackson -- are considering entering the race.</TEXT></DOC>
