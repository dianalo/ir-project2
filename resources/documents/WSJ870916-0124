The government trade panel ruled that the imports are harming U.S. producers. Earlier, the Commerce Department determined that the imports were being sold in the U.S. for as much as 70.4% below the price charged for the same products in Japan.    The findings by the two agencies are necessary before penalty duties can be imposed under the Anti-Dumping Act. The imports in question totaled about $103 million in 1986.    The bearings and parts are used in motor vehicles, railroad equipment, conveyors and other industrial machinery. Previous decisions have resulted in the imposition of anti-dumping duties on shipments from Italy, Yugoslavia, Romania, Hungary and China, ITC officials said. </TEXT></DOC>
