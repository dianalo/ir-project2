The population of thevillage grew primarily due to increasing fertility during the period.The Total Martial Fertility Ratio (20-49) increased from 6.98 to 8.37between the late seventeenth and the early nineteenth centuries. Themean age at first marriage for brides and grooms declined on averageby three years. During the 160 years of the study the level of mortalityactually increased. In the parish of Houghton-le-Spring, the coal miners,who were prime examples of proletarians, did marry much younger thana person engaged in the traditional occupations. Thus, the primary causeof the increasing level of fertility in the parish was the process ofproletarianization. The study of mortality revealed that coal minersand their dependents suffered higher rates of mortality than personsin other occupations. These higher rates were partly caused by a greaterincidence of deaths due to mining accidents. The population proved tobe surprisingly immobile. Approximately 90% of the population lived theirentire life within fifteen miles of their place of birth. This was trueof all occupational groups.</TEXT></DOC>
