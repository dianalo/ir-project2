The action by the department's Occupational Safety and Health Administration follows a decade-long dispute over what sort of risk benzene poses for workers and whether their exposure to benzene should be reduced substantially.    The new regulation will require such companies as printers and producers of petroleum, plastics, rubber, paint, adhesives and solvents to lower employees' maximum exposure to benzene fumes over an eight-hour period to an average of one part per million parts of air from the currently permitted 10 ppm. An average of five ppm would be allowed over any 15-minute period, applying to pipeline and other workers who are subject to short, intermittent bursts of benzene exposure.    In addition, the presence of more than 0.5 ppm would force the employer to follow various monitoring procedures, including medical surveillance of workers for signs of leukemia and other blood disorders.    The OSHA rule will give employers five months to comply with most of the new rules, such as providing workers with protection from inhalation of benzene fumes. Companies will have two years to install new engineering controls for reducing benzene exposure. The agency estimated it will cost employers about $24 million annually to meet the standards, covering about 240,000 workers.    A study released in April by the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health, a unit of the Health and Human Services Department, concluded that benzene in the air can cause leukemia and multiple myeloma, a rare bone cancer. According to the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, rubber workers exposed to benzene at the 10 ppm level had three times the risk of leukemia than workers who aren't exposed to benzene.    OSHA's failure, in the view of federal courts, to show the extent of that kind of risk forced the standard to be dropped in 1980, three years after it had been issued.    Acting on an American Petroleum Institute challenge to the 1977 regulation, an appeals court ruled that the OSHA standard was faulty because it didn't adequately show that a 10 ppm level of benzene posed a significant health risk to workers or that a reduction to one ppm would substantially reduce that risk. The Supreme Court in 1980 upheld the ruling, forcing withdrawal of the standard.    An important result of the court directive has been OSHA's development of &quot;risk analysis,&quot; a discipline that involves studies of health risk and ways to reduce such dangers.    Since then, OSHA has moved slowly toward reviving the standard as labor unions pushed for court pressure to speed OSHA action. The unions' efforts in court foundered, but the NIOSH study in April prompted OSHA to promise the new regulation soon.    The NIOSH study indicated that a 90% reduction in allowable benzene exposure would reduce the disease risk sharply for workers, but that it would still be higher than for workers who aren't exposed to benzene fumes. </TEXT></DOC>
