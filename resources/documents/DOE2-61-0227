Analyses of satellite images of ocean surface temperatureand color to determine recurrence, persistence, and other aspects ofcoastal upwelling formed the second element. Based on these studies,the third element, a field study of feeding ecology of Common Murresand Cassin's Auklets in central California, was conducted in 1985. Thepresent volume brings together the findings of the first and third elements,while the companion volume presents results of studies of satellite imagery.</TEXT></DOC>
