Sease</HL><DD> 12/08/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   Shaking off some of the doom and gloom that pervaded last week's trading, investors boosted stock prices in light trading.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 1812.17, up 45.43. Volume totaled 146.7 million shares, down from 184.8 million shares Friday. Advancing issues outnumbered losers 925 to 698. The Dow Jones industrials outpaced the broader market indices.    A stronger dollar provided the underpinning for yesterday's upturn. Investors, frightened by the dollar's sharp fall early last week, relaxed some amid signs that the U.S. is putting greater emphasis on bolstering the currency. Some market professionals had expected the U.S. might not have to tighten credit conditions in the wake of last week's interest-rate cuts by West Germany and other European nations.    Analysts also said that some inflation indicators -- the price of gold and the level of the Commodities Research Bureau Index -- provided further reassurance to nervous investors.    &quot;The bottom line is that investors are recovering from the excessive fear of inflation that gripped the market last week,&quot; said Peter Canelo, a market strategist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.    Eugene Peroni, director of technical research at Janney Montgomery Scott in Philadelphia, agreed that the dollar was the key to investors' more-optimistic outlook yesterday.    &quot;High-quality blue chip stocks had been moving into considerable discounts to their cash value,&quot; he said. &quot;The missing ingredient was the stability of the dollar. Now traders can start putting the state of the economy into perspective.&quot;    While Mr. Peroni said he was hesitant to describe yesterday's rally as anything more than a short-term technical phenomenon, he added that investor sentiment, according to his measures, has turned positive. He said that may set the stage for a year-end rally, although that won't be clear until closer to Dec. 18, when the simultaneous expiration of stock options, stock futures and stock-index options could trigger large swings in stock prices.    David Hale, chief economist for Kemper Financial Services in Chicago, said the rally is a sign that investors are discounting the likelihood of a recession. He said he expects the strength that was evident in large capitalization stocks yesterday will expand to include smaller stocks in January as investor confidence returns.    Mr. Canelo said the rise in stock prices in the face of a sharply declining bond market yesterday also was reassuring. He said it could mean that investors are beginning to abandon the &quot;safe haven&quot; of fixed income securities and are returning to the stock market. He added, however, that while there has been some foreign interest in the fixed income market recently, &quot;no one has been seen buying a stock yet from abroad.&quot; Most analysts figure that the stock market's potential for gains is limited without foreign investor participation.    Telex was the big gainer yesterday. It shot up 9 3/4 to 51 1/2 after Memorex International N.V. offered $56 in cash and $6 in junior preferred stock for each share of Telex common. Telex urged shareholders to reject a rival offer from a group led by Asher Edelman.    Southland Corp. also rose sharply, gaining 5 to close at 67, after announcing that its $2.19 billion of bonds were priced to yield 18%. That almost assures that the company's planned leveraged buyout, which had been stymied by financing problems, will be completed.    Southland's announcement gave a boost to other takeover stocks. Brockway Inc. gained 3 to 47; GAF rose 2 to 39; USG was up 2 to 27 1/4; Gillette picked up 3/4 to 27 7/8; and Newmont Mining rose 2 5/8 to 34 3/4.    Santa Fe Southern Pacific, another takeover stock, lost 1 1/8 to close at 40 5/8 after Olympia andamp; York Developments Ltd. said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it doesn't intend to propose a cash offer of $63 a share or more for Santa Fe.    Thompson Medical Co. also fell yesterday, losing 3 5/8 to 10 1/8. A management group withdrew its buyout offer.    Texaco gained 1 1/8 to 32 7/8. It offered a $1 billion payment to Pennzoil if Pennzoil agrees to a total $3.5 billion cap on its $10.3 billion judgment, even if the award is affirmed by the courts. Pennzoil fell 3/8 to 74 1/4.    Among industrials, Alcoa Aluminum gained 2 1/2 to 43 5/8; USX rose 1 1/8 to 27 3/4; Minnesota Mining andamp; Manufacturing climbed 2 to 58 1/2; General Electric rose 1 1/2 to 41 1/2; International Paper added 1 1/2 to 37 3/8; and Goodyear closed at 50 7/8, up 1 5/8.    Some blue chip consumer concerns also gained. Coca-Cola rose 1 1/2 to 37 3/4, Philip Morris gained 1 1/2 to 86 5/8 and Procter andamp; Gamble rose 2 to 80.    Barnes Group Inc. rose 2 1/2 to 29. The company said it would repurchase as many as 1.1 million shares. Barnes also said it had rebuffed another company that was interested in recapitalizing or acquiring the company.    Some money center bank stocks fell. Moody's Investors Service said earlier it was placing the credit ratings of several big banks under review for possible downgrading because of their loans to developing countries. BankAmerica fell 3/8 to 7 1/4; Chase Manhattan Corp. declined 1 to 21 7/8; Chemical New York Corp. lost 1/2 to 23 3/4; Citicorp fell 3/4 to 16 5/8; Irving Bank Corp. was off 1/2 to 45 1/4; J.P. Morgan fell 3/8 to 29 3/8, and Manufacturers Hanover Corp. skidded 1 3/8 to 24 7/8.    Copper stocks rose on the rising price of the metal. Asarco was up 2 5/8 to 25, Phelps Dodge gained 2 7/8 to 42 1/4 and Inspiration Resources was up 3/8 to 5 3/4.    Eastman Kodak rose 1 1/2 to 45 1/2. The company agreed to combine its U.S. photofinishing operations with those of Fuqua Industries. Fuqua closed unchanged at 24 3/4. </TEXT></DOC>
