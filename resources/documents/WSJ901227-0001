The bureau said yesterday that its almost-final tally fromthe 1990 census is 249,632,692 people, 10.2% more than the1980 census found.</LP><TEXT>   The addition of 3.8 million people to the preliminarytotal released this summer reflects 2.9 million residents thebureau missed the first time as well as the anticipated922,819 military and other federal employees and dependentsoverseas.   Under the Constitution, the new headcount will result in ashift of 19 seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.   California is the big winner, adding seven seats to giveit 52 representatives, or nearly 12% of all the seats in the435-member House. New York is the big loser. It will losethree seats and end up with 31 seats after the 1992 election.   The 1990 tally includes military and other federal workersand dependents living overseas. The 1980 tally didn't.Excluding those people, the resident population of the U.S.grew by 9.8% during the 1980s, Census Bureau Director BarbaraBryant said.   The bureau may yet make additional adjustments to thetally. Under terms of an out-of-court settlement of a lawsuitbrought by New York City and others who argued that thecensus disproportionately misses minorities, the CommerceDepartment must decide by July 15 whether to adjust thetallies statistically to compensate for the undercount.Commerce Undersecretary Michael Darby yesterday called the1990 census &quot;full, fair and efficient.&quot;   But congressional skepticism persists. &quot;It's not aquestion of whether we have counted everyone. The censusnever does,&quot; said Rep. Thomas Sawyer (D., Ohio), chairman ofthe House census subcommittee. &quot;The question is how closethey've come to the truth.&quot;   New York State Attorney General Robert Abrams, among thosesuing the bureau, was quick to complain that the 1990 censusstill undercounted his state. &quot;When large segments of ourresidents are left out of the political process, democracy isdevalued for all of us,&quot; he said.   Additions to the preliminary tally reflect, among otherthings, recanvassing of a substantial number of housing unitsby census enumerators. With aid from state and localgovernments, the bureau also identified about 125,000 housingunits it had missed. It also turned up an extra 400,000people from parole records, Mrs. Bryant said recently.   Mr. Darby noted that the new tally is &quot;surprisingly close&quot;to earlier projections that the census would find apopulation of 250 million. But Rep. Sawyer noted that the249.6 million total is still substantially shy of thebureau's recent projections, based on demographic data, of253.4 million.   The 1990 census confirms trends identified in earlierreports, such as the rapid growth of the western states. &quot;TheWest is the big population gainer,&quot; Mrs. Bryant said. In thepast decade, the population of the West has grown by 22%,while the South grew by 13.5%, the Northeast by 3.4%, and theMidwest by 1.3%.   The reassignment of seats in the House reflects thesetrends, with the West and Sunbelt states gaining at theexpense of the big industrial states of the Northeast andMidwest. In addition to California, states adding seatsinclude Florida, which gains four seats; Texas, which gainsthree seats; and Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Virginiaand Washington, which each gain one seat.   Besides New York, states losing seats include Illinois,Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania, which each lose two seats;and Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Massachusetts,Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia, which each lose oneseat.   None of these shifts comes as a surprise, however. Earlierbureau reports on the 1990 count pointed to all of them.   The figures may provide new ammunition for the District ofColumbia's perennially unsuccessful campaign for statehood.Although the census found that the district lost populationduring the 1980s, it still is larger than either Vermont,Alaska or Wyoming. Yet the district hasn't any seats in theSenate, and its one representative in the House can't vote.   The bureau also noted yesterday that four states lostpopulation in the 1980s. They are Iowa, North Dakota, WestVirginia and Wyoming.   ---                       Population Power                                                                                                          State-by-state tally of population and seats in the Houseof Representatives based on 1990 census                                                                                                                                      1990        TOTAL    CHANGE                            POPULATION     HOUSE     FROM                          (In millions)    SEATS    PRESENT                                                                                                          California                 29.84         52          7   New York                   18.04         31         -3   Texas                      17.06         30          3   Pennsylvania               11.92         21         -2   Illinois                   11.47         20         -2   Ohio                       10.89         19         -2   Michigan                    9.33         16         -2   New Jersey                  7.75         13         -1   N.
