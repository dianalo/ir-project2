(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By Gene WilburnandM;Multilanguage word processors add linguistic oomph to PCs in situations wherethe English keyboard, character set and punctuation symbols can't meet themore demanding requirements of non-English documents.andM;According to Linda Brandt, president of Gamma Ltd., the Santa Monica, Calif.,andO;producer of Multi-Lingual Scholar, the market for multilanguageword-processing products breaks down into two distinct categories.andM;The first is products that have been ''localized'' for a specificforeign-language market.andM;For example, a French program might have prompts in French, a user manualprinted in French and a keyboard with French accented vowels located wheresome punctuation marks are on the English keyboard.andM;The program would have a dictionary and thesaurus in French, and useFrench-language hyphenation rules.andM;''Localized'' versions of familiar products, such as WordPerfect andWordstar, are generally targeted for the international market.andM;The manuals, screen prompts and spelling checkers are translated into thehost language.andM;The second category comprises more advanced multilingual word processors thatare designed to handle multiple languages at the same time.andM;The foreign-language market is a significant one for vendors.andM;Marc Bailey, executive vice president of sales and marketing at MicroProInternational Corp. in San Rafael, Calif., maintains that multilanguageversions of his company's Wordstar word-processing packages are an integralpart of its business.andM;''Currently, about 40 percent of our revenues can be attributed to salesoutside the U.S., obviously indicating the importance we place on qualityforeign-language versions of Wordstar,'' he said.andM;The more specialized and versatile ''multilingual'' word processors attractusers who require support for more than one language or for language fonts insuch alphabets as Greek, Syriac, Hebrew, Hindi, Arabic and so on.andM;Not surprisingly, multilingual word processors find a receptive market inuniversities, colleges, embassies, libraries and ethnic communities.andM;Use in Book PublishingandM;David Levenson, associate professor of religion at Florida State Universityin Tallahassee, works with Multi-Lingual Scholar to produce manuscripts thatcontain some text in Syriac.andM;He predicts that these specialty word processors ''are going to transform thepublishing of manuscripts in certain languages.andP;  They make the editing andproduction of books that include Hebrew, classical Greek and Syriac easierand less expensive.''andM;Levenson's experience is similar to that of John Catan, a professor ofphilosophy at the State University of New York at Brockport.andM;Using Apollen Systems Inc.'s Grafeas, Catan produces laser-printed copies ofhis work on ancient Italian philosophy that includes quotations in classicalGreek.andM;Ethnic communities are another target for multilingual word processing.andO;Chris Bouris, president of Pyramid Computer Systems in Toronto, sellsconsiderable quantities of Grafeas to Toronto's large Greek community.andM;Greek businesspeople use the package for business correspondence, includingmail merges, Bouris said.andM;The local Greek Orthodox diocese has purchased Grafeas, and, Bouris said, ''Iexpect to see them produce their Greek newspapers using Grafeas rather thanthe complicated typesetting systems they currently use.''andM;Found in Strange PlacesandM;Multilingual word processors can be found in some unusual settings.andM;In the scattered campuses of the Arctic College in Canada's thinly populatedNorthwest Territories, for instance, Inuits use a customized version ofMulti-Lingual Scholar to produce bilingual English/Inuktitut documents ontheir local area network-based adult-education center PCs.andM;The bottom line is that when word-processor users need something that goesbeyond the 26 characters immortalized in the toddler's ABC song, and whenthat something isn't in the IBM PC extended-character set, they are lookingfor software that can carry them into alternative linguistic environments.andM;Even in a strongly Anglocentric North America, there is a vigorous verticalmarket for multilingual word processing.andM;----------Gene Wilburn is a free-lance writer living in Toronto.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
