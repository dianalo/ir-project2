Whitehead said Friday.   Whitehead, just back from a two-week trip to four Soviet-bloccountries, told reporters ``my impression is they are very muchinterested in buying U.S. planes. It's a significant thing,psychologically, I believe _ Eastern European countries flying U.S.planes.''   He declined to identify the countries that expressed interest,but another official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said theywere Poland, Hungary and Romania.   If deals are arranged it would be the first U.S. aircraft salesto Hungary and Poland.   In the early 1970s, Romania purchased several Boeing 707passenger jets under a contract arranged at a time when the UnitedStates was wooing Romania in hopes of increasing that country'sindependence from Moscow.   Whitehead said that from the State Department's viewpoint, ``itwould be feasible and desirable'' for the sales, but he noted twomajor stumbling blocks.   Buying U.S. aircraft would require large expenditures by thegovernments and credits from the U.S. Export-Import Bank for thepurchases would not be available, Whitehead said.   The aircraft companies, moreover, would be prohibited fromselling equipment on a list of military-applicable goods banned forexport to communist countries. This could limit the type ofairplanes the countries could buy.   ``There is some navigational equipment that could not be on theplanes,'' Whitehead said. ``They would have to buy stuff that wouldnot be on the (embargo) list.''   Whitehead, the No. 2 official in the State Department, hasassumed special responsibility for a U.S. effort to gain influencein countries that have been dominated by the Soviet Union sinceWorld War II.   Under the policy, the United States has offered the nationsincreased trade and better relations in general, in return forimproved human rights performance and the institution of freeeconomic policies. On his latest trip, Whitehead visited Poland,Romania, Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia.   Whitehead said he told Romanian leader Nicolae Ceausescu thathis country is in danger of losing special trading rights grantedby Congress each year to reward Romania for its relatively freeemigration policies.   The trading rights _ most-favored-nation status _ have beenworth hundreds of millions of dollars to Romania in previous years,but renewal for 1988 has been suspended by Congress because theCeausescu government's human rights policies are consideredrepressive, especially toward religious minorities.   Whitehead said he told the Romanian leader there was only a``50-50 chance it would be renewed, but there was still time.''   Ceausescu, in keeping with previous discussions with U.S.officials, refused to discuss the human rights issues on groundsthey were strictly an internal matter, Whitehead said.   ``I came home with not much reason to hope there will beimprovement,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
