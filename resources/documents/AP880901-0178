Reynolds Tobacco Co., anFDA official said Thursday.   The official, who discussed the internal agency matter only ongrounds he not be identified by name, noted that regulation ofcigarettes has long been reserved to Congress.   R.J. Reynolds is aware of that, and is making no claim that itsnew ``smokeless cigarette'' is anything other than a cigarette, hesaid. It will be taxed as a cigarette and carry the same warninglabels Congress requires on conventional cigarettes.   Moreover, the official said, the company is ``bending overbackward'' not to make any health claim on behalf of its newcigarette.   If the manufacturer claimed some health benefit for the newproduct _ such as less risk of incurring ailments linked to smoking_ it might come under FDA jurisdiction.   The FDA source said agency lawyers have told FDA CommissionerFrank Young that they would marshall whatever legal arguments theycould find if he decides to attempt regulate the cigarette, butthat they would see little prospect of winning a court battle.   Because of the way R.J. Reynolds is presenting the new product,there has been little expectation even by anti-smoking forces thatthe FDA would take the position it could regulate the new product.   However, the agency was obligated to formally consider thematter because of a petition filed in April by the Washington-basedCoalition on Smoking or Health, which represents the American HeartAssociation, American Lung Association, American Cancer Society andthe American Medical Association.</TEXT></DOC>
