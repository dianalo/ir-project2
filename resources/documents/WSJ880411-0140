Meanwhile, the deficit has doubled, inflation has reached an annual rate of 600%, and three finance ministers have come and gone.    Few see any reason to believe that last week's new plan to stabilize the Brazilian economy, which is centered on a two-month supension of inflation-linked wage increases for state employees, will fare any better, or that Finance Minister Mailson Ferreira da Nobrega's job is any more secure than that of his predecessors.    The measure was a bold move for a president who has come to view inertia as the best form of security. The suspension effectively will slash salaries and cut an estimated $8.3 billion from federal spending this year. The aim is to hold the budget deficit to 4.9% of economic output, down from a projected 7%. This, it is hoped, will help stop high inflation from spiraling into hyperinflation.    In Washington, where Mr. Nobrega is to meet tomorrow with the U.S. Treasury secretary, James Baker, and the International Monetary Fund director, Michel Camdessus, the spending cuts will be viewed as at least a move in the right direction. They may help Brazil conclude agreements in the next few months both with creditor banks and the IMF, alleviating political, trade and other pressures that have stemmed from last year's moratorium on $67 billion of foreign bank debt. The country has made some interest payments to the banks this year and has reached agreement with them on many of the main points of a debt settlement.    But any improvement in the domestic economic situation, or in President Sarney's abject standing, seems far off.    Popular disillusionment, presidential weakness, political confusion and a deep-seated uncertainty have become accepted facts of life that militate against any attempt at reform. &quot;Trying to stabilize the economy inevitably meets the overhwelming obstacle of the absolute disrepute of the government,&quot; wrote a leading economist, Gustavo Franco, in the influential Jornal do Brasil newspaper. Christopher Lund, president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Sao Paulo, predicted that &quot;this is just going to be a zoo.&quot;    In the formulaton of the most recent package, there were several signs that the pattern of Mr. Sarney's government will indeed continue. Despite winning a major victory last month in Congress, when a presidential system and a five-year term for future presidents were adopted for the new constitution, Mr. Sarney hesitated for three weeks before taking any economic action, torn between the resistance of the military to wage-indexation cuts and the insistence of Mr. Nobrega for the cuts. Vacillation remains in the president's nature even at the best of times.    Moreover, he remains worried about his own term of office, whose length has yet to be decided in a separate vote. Although there seems little doubt that Mr. Sarney will get the five years he seeks, officials say the issue still preoccupies him. A Sao Paulo financier with close links to the government, who asked not to be identified, said this uncertainty will lead to further promises of funding for the regions of deputies whose support needs to be secured, adding to pledges made for last month's vote.    Austerity thus could be quickly mitigated in the style that has seen the deficit soar from 1.6% of economic output in 1984 to the 7% predicted for this year.    There will be other pressures. Employees of the central bank and some other state units already have gone on strike to protest the wage cuts, bringing 15,000 people into the streets of Rio de Janeiro last Friday. The government reacted by firing 19 central bank officials and saying other strikes would cause similar action.    However, the dismissals were withdrawn the following day, suggesting a weak administration may waver before any mass protest. The situation at large and profitable state-owned companies, such as the oil concern Petrobras S.A., could be particularly volatile.    President Sarney also will have to cope with the meddling of the armed forces, which accepted the economic package only with great reluctance. Unlike in Argentina, where a more abrupt and traumatic democratic transition has at least excluded the military from day-to-day policy making, the generals here still regard the economy -- and almost everything else -- as their terrain. The result is slow, confused decision-making against a constant background of veiled ultimatums from an army whose grasp of the need for security is far greater than of the mechanisms of inflation.    Meanwhile, says economist Paulo Nogueira Batista, &quot;the situation is critical and there is definitely a risk of hyperinflation.&quot; The government is already working with estimates of 600% inflation this year, and such predictions generally have proved conservative. Hans Grether, finance director of Kibon S.A., a large ice-cream maker, predicts that if current inflation of about 18% a month &quot;goes to 25%, it will be socially intolerable.&quot; Economists generally define hyperinflation as beginning when inflation reaches 50% a month.    In this climate, investment is scarce and the economy stagnant. Industrial production declined 1.5% in February from January, its biggest monthly fall in two years, and was 8.8% below the year-earlier figure. Few believe the deficit can really be brought under control, partly because so much of it is now accounted for by interest payments on accumulated public debt. </TEXT></DOC>
