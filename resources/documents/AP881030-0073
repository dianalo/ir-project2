She started her campaign in Karachi's Lyari slum district.   ``We are going to win,'' she told a cheering crowd. ``The daysof injustice to the poor will end on Nov. 16.''   The main opposition to Ms. Bhutto's party is the IslamicDemocratic Alliance of nine center-right parties including thePakistan Muslim League of former Prime Minister Mohammad KhanJunejo. Some of the alliance members are already on the campaigntrail.   Voters will elect 217 members to the National Assembly on Nov.16. Three days later they will cast ballots for 460 members of thelegislative assemblies of the provinces of Punjab, Sind,Baluchistan, and the North-West Frontier.   The late President Mohammed Zia ul-Haq dissolved the NationalAssembly and provincial legislatures on May 29 and dismissedJunejo. He accused the legislators of incompetence and failing touphold law and order.   Zia, an army general who seized power in a military coup in1977, was killed Aug. 17 in the crash of a C-130 transport plane.Among others killed in the crash were the U.S. ambassador and anAmerican military adviser.   Although sabotage was suspected, the cause of the crash is stillunder investigation.   In the 1977 coup, Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime MinisterZulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was hanged two years later after beingconvicted of conspiracy in the killing of a political opponent.   A caretaker government led by former Senate Chairman GhulamIshaq Khan took over after Zia's death and promised to carry outhis policies including the elections.   Zia declared that candidates in the elections had to run asindividuals unaffiliated with any political party, but that wasoverruled by the Supreme Court on Oct. 2. It said candidates couldrun on party tickets, and that decision was expected to help Ms.Bhutto's party.</TEXT></DOC>
