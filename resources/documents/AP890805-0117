The rail stoppage came as new Prime Minister Czeslaw Kiszczakmet with economic and political specialists from the oppositionSolidarity movement in an effort to assemble a Cabinet.   Former Prime Minister Mieczyslaw F. Rakowski, now firstsecretary of the Communist Party, conferred with party and armyleaders Saturday, urging them to be proud of the party and defendit from ``demagogic attacks.''   Rakowski told the army officers meeting in Warsaw that in thepast the armed forces served as ``a strong support of people'srule. The situation is the same today and I believe it willcontinue in the future.''   The rail stoppage between noon and 1 p.m. affected domestic railtraffic in the Silesia region except for certain trains takingchildren to summer camps, according to reports in the officialmedia and from the Solidarity Information Service.   State television said about 80 trains were stopped.   The strike was supported both by Solidarity and the officialcommunist-allied trade unions.   Jan Renda, leader of a strike committee in Katowice, said railworkers now receive $60 a month in basic pay plus overtime andvarious differentials and bonuses.   The workers want the basic pay increased to $96 a month alongwith cost-of-living adjustments recently approved by Parliament.   Management is offering to raise the basic pay to $84, but thatwould include a cost-of-living adjustment that has not yet beencomputed, state television reported.   The average monthly income in Poland is $127, according togovernment statistics.   Renda, interviewed on state television, said, ``If our demandsare not met, we expect the worse _ a general (railway) strike _something that has never happened in the postwar period.''   Solidarity and the government media reported strikes by postalworkers in Legnica, by workers at a tire factory in Gruzdiaz and bytram-car operators in Walbrzych.   Strikes for higher pay have become common as the cost of livingincreases steadily. It is estimated the inflation rate for thisyear will exceed 120 percent.   Gen. Kiszczak, who was turned down Thursday when he askedSolidarity Sen. Zofia Kuratowska to join his government, continuedmeetings with Solidarity lawmakers.   Kiszczak met Saturday with Solidarity Deputy Ryszard Bugaj andopposition political theorists Bronislaw Geremek and Deputy JacekKuron.</TEXT></DOC>
