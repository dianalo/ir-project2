Carroll (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> AXP </CO><IN> FIN ERN </IN><DATELINE> NEW YORK  </DATELINE><TEXT>   American Express Co. posted a 15% decline in first-quarter earnings, but results were about flat excluding the effects of an accounting change.    American Express said its travel services, which include credit cards and traveler's checks, continued their strong performance in the quarter, as did the smaller IDS Financial Services operation. But the company, which had weak results throughout last year, said its Shearson Lehman Brothers securities business contributed less to the parent company's earnings, and earnings declined again at American Express Bank.    Net income fell to $265.7 million, or 62 cents a share, from the year-earlier $313.9 million, or 71 cents a share. The 1987 quarter included a $49 million gain from deferred income tax benefits related to the adoption of a new accounting rule.    Revenue climbed 30% to $5.37 billion from $4.15 billion.    Lawrence Eckenfelder, an analyst at Prudential-Bache Securities Inc., said the results were about as expected, though he thought that the travel services earnings were strong and that Shearson had a good quarter. Following the announcement, American Express shares closed at $23.75, down 25 cents, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    Earnings from travel services rose 18% in the quarter to $171 million and accounted for 64% of total profit, up from 46% a year earlier. Revenue increased 17% to $1.6 billion. Card charge dollar volume rose 20%, and the number of cards in force climbed 17% to 28.2 million, largely reflecting heavy marketing and partly reflecting the introduction of the Optima card about a year ago.    At IDS Financial Services, earnings rose 19% to $31 million, as annuity and life insurance operations did well. Limiting the improvement were an increase in costs for new products and services and a sharp decline in sales of mutual funds and limited partnerships.    Shearson's contribution to American Express's earnings fell to $52 million from $78 million a year earlier, but that was largely because of a host of special factors. A $50 million pretax charge related to the acquisition of E.F. Hutton Group was only partly offset by a $33 million pretax gain from the sale of Shearson's interest in McLeod Young Weir. In addition, American Express sharply reduced its holdings in Shearson in the past year. It now holds 61.5% of Shearson, assuming conversion of all the convertible preferred shares outstanding.    Shearson's earnings, which are reported separately and which included Hutton's results for the first time, rose slightly in the quarter, in contrast to the lackluster results that brokerage houses have been posting in the wake of the October stock market crash.    &quot;I think Shearson had very good results relative to the results of its industry,&quot; said Howard Clark, American Express's chief financial officer.    American Express Bank's earnings tumbled to $27 million from the year-earlier $56 million, largely because the latest quarter included a $3.8 million charge related to staff reductions, and the 1987 quarter included $19 million of the benefits from the new accounting rule. The bank, which added nearly $1 billion to loan-loss reserves last year, continued to narrow its focus to fee-generating businesses in the first quarter and further reduced by $155 million its loans outstanding to less-developed countries. </TEXT></DOC>
