Mergers Commission has widened itsinvestigation of the proposed takeover of Plessey Co Plc by GEC Siemens Plcto cover the potential threat to the UK national interest of the loss ofPlessey's semiconductor research facilities, reports the Intependent: underthe GEC Siemens proposals, thMe would disappear into Siemens.andM;And Plessey Co was back in court yesterday, pursuing in the Court of Appealits quest for a decision that GEC Plc's plans to sell a stake in GEC PlesseyTelecommunications Ltd to Siemens AG if the bid to acquire Plessey succeededtriggered the provision that allowed the other to acquire GEC Plesseyoutright if either entered a unilateral agreement on its 50% shareholding inthe equally-owned company.andM;kjDespite being bested in its quest for National Advanced Systems, MemorexTelex International NV says that it is looking for other companies toacquire, mainly firms in the mainframe peripherals market.andM;Telerate Inc, New York and Lotus Development Corp, Cambridge, Massachusetts,have given up on their joint marketing and development agreement, signed inJune 1987, which called for Telerate and Lotus to develop and market aproduct that would feed Telerate's real-time information financialinformation in Lotus 1-2-3 and other software products for manipulation: thetwo companies said they had been unable to reach agreement on implementationof the joint venture.andM;Norsk Data A/S says that while it is reexamining all its businesses in lightof its new policy to diversify into systems integration with third partyproducts, a report in the Sunday Times suggesting that sale of its WordplexPlc acquisition to Apricot Computers Plc was in the wind was wide of themark: Norsk insists that &quot;there are no contacts with Apricot, and a similaridea as Wordplex had two years ago is not believed to be feasible,&quot; the firmsaid in a statement.andM;Comparex Informationssysteme GmbH estimates that acquisition of NationalAdvanced Systems Europe will add between $300m and $350m to its annualturnover, which would take its turnover up to between $885m and $935m a year;it is currently owned 66% by BASF AG, 33% by Siemens AG, but thoseshareholdings are likely to be diluted by Hitachi, and maybe Olivetti, takingstakes.andM;Nynex Corp plans to test an interactive service on its fibre optic cablesthat will enable professionals to exchange video information over thetelephone, so that advertising agencies could for example show storyboards toclients over the phone on high resolution VDUs.andM;And in the UK, the Department of Trade andamp; Industry has given BritishTelecommunications Plc permission to transmit television pictures over fibreoptic lines in a field trial in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire: thecompany is at present barred from transmitting television pictures tosubscribers commercially, but the prohibition may be relaxed after November1990.andM;And British Telecom reckons that the market has changed so much since itacquired 51% of Mitel Corp in 1985 that the restrictions then imposed on itsmarketing of Mitel products in the UK are no longer justified, since its andMitel's share of the market have both fallen since then, and the creation ofGEC Plessey telecommunications has increased competition from that quarter:it is therefore asking the Office of Fair Trading to lift the ban on jointmarketing with Mitel.andM;Toshiba Corp has now confirmed plans to manufacture its lap-top computers forthe European market at a new plant in Regensburg, Baveria: the company plansto open the plant in April next year, starting production at a rate of 5,000a month, with a capacity of 10,000 a month; the firm's initial investment inthe plant is put at $14m.andM;Lots of financial news coming out of Hanover, and AEG Olympia AG, the officesystems and equipment company that has been something of a corporate basketcase is still a drain on its parent - and it will not make a profit for 1989either: last year it lost $43m on sales that rose only 5% at $800m or so -despite having a 60% share of the world market for sorting systems.andM;Bull AG in West Germany had a spiffing year in 1988, on the back of increasedsales of the Bull group's peripherals - magnetoelectrostatic printers, matrixprinters and so forth: profits surged 1,400% to $1.7m on sales up 18.6% at$330m.andM;Alcatel NV's Standard Elektrilk Lorenz AG by contrast had a rotten year, withunspecified losses in excess of $5.5m in its office and computer systemsbusiness: despite this, the company does not intend to seek a buyer for whatis primarily an IBM-compatible peripherals and terminals business, but 350 to400 of the 5,000 employees will have to go this year; the business turns overaround $555m annually.andM;Mannesmann Tally GmbH looks for a 10% increase in sales of its printers thisyear: sales last year rose 7% to $247m, giving i 12% stake in the Europeanmarket, second only to Epson Corp - but the figures disguise a dull timeoutside West Germany, because sales within the home market soared 45% to$55.3m and are forecast to put on another 26% this year to reach about $70m.andM;Those to whom computer-tinting of black-and-white movies is sacriligiousgilding of the lily won't shed too many tears that perpetrator Color SystemsTechnology Inc, Marina del Rey, California is trying to get creditors toreschedule debt.andM;Ford Motor Co is showing off a brilliant application of computerised fibreoptic lighting at the Geneva Motor Show this week: a single bulb installed inthe dashboard is used to feed light down fibre optic cables, from which itspills out at the ends to create the headlights - which can be dimmed andincreased in intensity under control of the computer; the single bulbreplaces all those in the headlights, and if it blows, the car is completelywithout lights...andO;</TEXT></DOC>
