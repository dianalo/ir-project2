At lastCrippen gave the ``go.''   The result was splendid. Discovery roared off and the astronautsreturned to Earth four days later after a remarkably smooth flightduring which they deployed a communications satellite.   Two months later a second shuttle, Atlantis, took off on a secretDefense Department mission, another success, setting the stage for aplanned seven-flight schedule in 1989.   Developments in the Mideast ranked in sixth place in 1988, with641 points.   After years of maneuverings and hesitations, Yasser Arafatfinally made it clear enough to satisfy a skeptical United States:The Palestine Liberation Organization, which he heads, accepts theexistence of Israel and renounces all forms of terrorism.   And so on Dec. 14, in a startling reversal of policy, PresidentReagan announced that the United States would open a ``substantivedialogue'' with the PLO. Israeli leaders expressed dismay anddisappointment, even though U.S. Secretary of State George Shultzadded that ``the U.S. commitment to the security of Israel remainsunflinching.''   The big U.S. turn in the Mideast peace process came as Israel'sdominant parties, the right-of-center Likud and left-of-centerLabor, agreed to form a new coalition government, with Likud'sYitzhak Shamir as prime minister. Labor Party leader Simon Pereswill serve as finance minister.   Earlier in the year, Jordan had cut its administrative ties tothe Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a Palestinian uprising groundon, and the PLO had proclaimed a Palestinian state. It was aphantom, but an important Arab symbol.   The U.S. opening to the PLO came, ironically, after it hadrefused Arafat entry to the United States to address the UnitedNations. The U.N. General Assembly thereupon moved temporarily toGeneva to hear Arafat call for negotiations that would includeIsrael and the PLO. That speech failed to meet the U.S. conditions,but Arafat's statements at a news conference afterward did.   The end of the Iran-Iraq War scored seventh in the voting, with544 points. After eight years of slaughter in which well over amillion people, and perhaps 2 million, were killed or wounded, inwhich 13-year-old boys died as volunteer sacrificial minesweepers,in which clouds of poison gas wiped out entire villages, in whichhundreds of billions of dollars were squandered for revenge andmartyrdom, the war between Iran and Iraq ended in August. That grimevent ranked seventh among the news stories in the AP year-end poll.   After the cease-fire Aug. 20, the devastated rivals began peacetalks. Neither was a victor. The two countries need an estimated$110 billion to rebuild everything from their oil fields to theirschools. With the stress of the battle over, hopes rose that Iranmight seek a rapprochement with the United States, and terrorismmight abate in its random search for victims.   The nation's environment, in its broadest sense, ranked eighth inthe voting, with 506 points.   The health of the planet, its winds, oceans, the land itself, didnot fare well in 1988.   The ``greenhouse effect'' _ the development of a blanket ofcarbon dioxide allowing heat to accumulate in the atmosphere _ wasat least partly blamed for the drought and other climatic changes.The use of aerosol containers was pouring a gas into the air thatwas blamed for a hole over the Antarctic in the atmospheric shieldagainst cancer-causing ultraviolet rays _ a warning, some scientistssaid, of disaster to come.   Meanwhile, syringes and other refuse washed ashore on some of thenation's beaches, where the barefoot once waded with impunity.Beaches were closed along the northern Atlantic seaboard, and thepublic was outraged by the violation of summertime oceansideserenity.   Gorbachev's Dec. 7 visit to the United Nations ranked ninth inthe voting, with 504 points.   The Soviet leader startled the world body, along with U.S.planners and diplomats, by announcing that the Soviet Union would,unilaterally, reduce its armed forces by 500,000 troops, along withtanks and other equipment. News of the Armenian earthquake requiredGorbachev to cut short his visit to New York, which had welcomed theSoviet leader warmly and enthusiastically.   In voting the Gorbachev announcement No. 9, many editors alsotook note of the May 29 Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in Moscow, and ofGorbachev's June 28 announcement of reforms within the Soviet Union_ ``glasnost,'' more openness, and ``perestroika,'' economicrevamping.   One of the nation's worst sieges of forest fires ranked as theNo. 10 news story, with 492 points.   The Boise Interagency Fire Center, which keeps track of thenation's wildfires, said that through the exceptionally dry yearmore than 30,000 firefighters battled 72,000 blazes that charredmore than 5 million acres in the United States, including 2.2million acres in Alaska.   By mid-July, a dozen fires raged in the venerable YellowstoneNational Park. Other fires blazed in six surrounding nationalforests.   When November snows finally smothered the Yellowstone flames,706,278 acres, nearly half of the 2.2-million-acre ``mother park,''were black and dead, 29 buildings were destroyed, including 20 atthe Old Faithful complex. More than $115 million had been spent inmostly futile firefighting efforts, and the economies of touristtowns in three states suffered.   The blazes called into dispute an established wildfire managementpolicy that decreed that forest fires caused by people should befought, but those touched off by nature should be allowed to burn ifthere were no threat to life or property or historic sites.   At year's end that argument still smoldered. But, fire or nofire, Old Faithful remained faithful to its ageless schedule,erupting every 75 minutes.   The second 10 stories were:   11. The Reagan-Gorbachev summit in Moscow.   12. The TV evangelists: Jimmy Swaggart touched by scandal; JimBakker indicted on fraud charges.   13. AIDS keeps spreading; no breakthroughs.   14. Hurricane Gilbert ravages the Caribbean.   15. Nuclear armaments plants shut down.   16. Mega-buyouts and mergers on Wall Street.   17. Olympic Games, drug scandal in Seoul.   18. U.S. economy remains sturdy, unemployment low.   19. Changes in Soviet system, unrest in republics.   20. Rescue of ice-bound whales.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv Thurs PMs, Dec. 29, or Thereafter</NOTE></DOC>
