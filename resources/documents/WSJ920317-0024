Individuals familiar with the effort to dispatch asbestoslitigation in state and federal courts in New York City saidthat about 90 former asbestos makers have agreed so far topay a total of $350 million to more than 2,000 plaintiffs tosettle the suits. About 2,000 state cases in New York Cityhave not yet been resolved.</LP><TEXT>   A report detailing the disposal of nearly 1,100 federalcases and 1,300 New York state cases was filed in U.S.District Court in Brooklyn by Kenneth R. Feinberg, a specialmaster appointed to oversee the settlement of many of thecases. Most of the cases involved workers at the BrooklynNavy Yards or New York area power plants, who came intocontact with asbestos. The material was widely used asinsulation until it was discovered to cause respiratoryillnesses and cancer.   The amounts each defendant will pay to settle claims willnot be made public. But individuals familiar with thesettlement said that about half the money will be paid byW.R. Grace andamp; Co., Owens Corning Fiberglas Corp.,Owens-Illinois Inc., Pittsburgh Corning Corp., FibreboardCorp. and U.S. Mineral Products Co., as well as a group of 18companies known as Center for Claims Resolution that includeGAF Corp., National Gypsum Co. and U.S. Gypsum Co. Much ofthe cost of the settlements likely will be covered byinsurance.   Judy Yavitz, a lawyer in New York at Anderson Kill Olick andamp;Oshinsky who represented the Center for Claims Resolution,said she thought the effort to clear the courts of asbestoslitigation in New York was unfair to defendants.&quot;Consolidation {causes} the minor cases to be worth a lotmore,&quot; Ms. Yavitz said. &quot;The defendants were in the positionof having a loaded gun put to their head.&quot;   The effort to clear away the asbestos cases in New YorkCity was headed by two Brooklyn federal judges, Jack B.Weinstein and Charles P. Sifton, and New York state SupremeCourt Justice Helen E. Freedman, who is still overseeing the2,000 pending state cases. The three judges quickly tried toresolve the asbestos cases by pushing them toward settlementwhile at the same time trying cases that couldn't be settled.   The report describes a process that involved four judges,dozens of lawyers and thousands of parties. &quot;It's veryimpressive,&quot; said Judge William Schwarzer, who heads theFederal Judicial Center, which trains judges in expeditingcases. Judge Schwarzer also said that during the past yearmost of the asbestos-related cases in the Boston federalcourts have been resolved.   Federal and state court judges nationwide have beensearching for a way to unburden their dockets of asbestoscases, but thousands of asbestos cases are still activethroughout the country. Almost all of the more than 20,000unresolved federal cases have been moved to Philadelphia,where they will be handled by one judge. Meanwhile, thelargest state asbestos trial, involving nearly 9,000plaintiffs, recently began in Baltimore.   Asbestos cases pose a tricky problem for the courtsbecause of the huge number of plaintiffs and the drain put onthe former asbestos makers. &quot;It's a race for a limited amountof assets,&quot; Judge Schwarzer said, noting that Manville Corp.and Eagle-Picher Inc. have filed for Chapter 11 protectionbecause of their asbestos liability.   Judge Schwarzer said he thought the best solution to theflood of asbestos litigation would be to develop a specialtype of bankruptcy that would allow companies to continueoperating while maintaining funds to pay off the claims ofboth current and future claimants.   ---   LANDLORD CAN DENY SUBLEASE at whim, Massachusetts highcourt says.   The state's Supreme Judicial Court said commerciallandlords don't have to act reasonably when they turn down asubtenant, so long as the original lease allows the landlordto veto subleasing arrangements without an explanation.   The case arose in 1988 when a corporation that owned aBoston bar and eatery, Clarke's Restaurant, sought to sellit. The bank financing the deal demanded the power to approveall future subtenants. The restaurant's landlord refused, andthe restaurant sued.   Barbara L. Moore of Boston, who represented therestaurant, argued that good faith and fair dealing wereimplicit in the lease. A lower court jury had agreed andawarded the restaurant owner $3 million for breach of lease.   But the high court agreed with the landlord, representedby William F. Griffin Jr. of Boston, who argued that thelease should be read literally and that a contract requiringthe landlord's consent means strictly that. The restaurantowner should have negotiated for a lease that mandatedreasonableness, he said.   A &quot;very large proportion&quot; of Boston commercial landlordshave similar lease clauses and would have been harmed if thelower court ruling was upheld, said Philip S. Lapatin, anattorney for the Greater Boston Real Estate Board. The boardfiled an amicus brief in the case on behalf of the landlord.
