Atthe same time, the need for greater spent-fuel pool capacity has reducedstorage canister spacing to the point where maximum allowable fresh enrichmentsare lower than those necessary for longer cycles. As a result, burnupcredit analysis has been applied to spent-fuel storage rack criticalityanalysis. This allows the placement, after exposure, of higher fuel enrichmentsin the spent-fuel racks than would normally be allowed under the assumptionof a fresh condition. The CASMO lattice physics code is used to analyzeburnup credit on the Maine Yankee spent-fuel storage racks. Unit cellsensitivity analysis of rack criticality to in-core depletion effectsand to out-of-core decay is considered. Also, large array criticalityanalysis is performed to study options for the placement of fresh andburned assemblies.</TEXT></DOC>
