(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A prosecutor says the ex-president of adefunct Livingston brokerage house will testify against a formerboard member of the New York Federal Reserve Bank who was accused inthe federal banking system's first insider trading case.   The disclosure came at a hearing Monday where Gilbert C. Schulmanadmitted lying on the witness stand during his two trials forcharges stemming from the $144 million collapse of Bevill, Bresler andamp;Schulman Inc.   Schulman, 41, also admitted lying when he denied during thetrials in April 1987 and July 1987 that he regularly received secretinterest rate data from a board member of the New York FederalReserve Bank, Robert A. Rough.   Assistant U.S. Attorney Paul Weissman said at the hearing thatSchulman would be called as a witness against Rough at Rough's trialon insider trading charges, scheduled to begin Feb. 21.   Schulman testified he and Rough were friends for 15 years and metand talked regularly during 1982 to 1984, when Rough served on theNew York Fed's board as president of the National Bank of SussexCounty in Branchville, but that no secret information was exchanged.Rough has pleaded innocent.   Also at the hearing before U.S. District Judge Dickinson R.Debevoise, attorneys for Schulman asked for a reduction ofSchulman's eight-year sentence for securities and tax fraud.   They suggested a total 30-month sentence _ he has served 16months at the Allenwood, Pa., prison camp _ and five yearsprobation, including 2,500 hours of community service at a soupkitchen.   Debevoise sliced two years off the sentence. Attorneys said theywere not sure what portion of the six years Schulman would have toserve.   The judge recognized Schulman's cooperation in the government'sinvestigation of Rough.   ``However, I must say my cynicism does have some effect here,''he said. He noted that Schulman denied the charges in two trials,the second resulting from a mistrial on some charges.   ``When that failed, you turned over somebody to the governmentfor prosecution,'' Debevoise said.   One of Schulman's attorneys, Benson B. Weintraub, said his clientwas the subject of ``harassment and ridicule'' by other inmates andstaff at Allenwood because of his cooperation.   ``He wears the jacket, your honor, of a snitch,'' he said.   Weintraub also spoke of the suffering of Schulman's wife and fivechildren, aged 4 to 18, who sat in the row behind the defendant.   Schulman told Debevoise he had come ``full circle'' and admittedhis guilt. He said he would do anything he could to repay investorswho lost money and to repay the Internal Revenue Service.   Sentencing on the perjury plea was delayed until after the Roughtrial.   Rough, 49, of Sandyston Township, was indicted Dec. 8 on chargesthat he leaked secret data to Bevill, Bresler on the discount rateset by the Federal Reserve in Washington, D.C.   The discount rate is the rate the Fed charges for loans tofinancial institutions and is one of the clearest signals thecentral bank has at its disposal to indicate its monetary policy tothe financial markets. The indictment said the firm made millions ofdollars and avoided losses on the basis of the information. Inexchange, Rough allegedly received $47,000 in interest-deferredloans.   The brokerage house collapsed in April 1985. Four executives whopleaded guilty and cooperated with prosecutors were subsequentlysent to prison for charges stemming from the collapse.   As part of Schulman's plea, the government promised not toprosecute him further for crimes involving Bevill, Bresler, and totake no position at sentencing. The perjury charge carries afive-year maximum sentence.   Schulman agreed to cooperate fully and provide documentsrequested by prosecutors.</TEXT></DOC>
