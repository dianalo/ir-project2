<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-43-1216 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the context of the cold dark matter theory for the large-scale matterdistribution, the onset of galaxy formation is a gradual process, withstar formation being initiated at z = about 10 and reaching a peak forluminous galaxies at z = about 1. The mass function of galaxy cores matchesthe observed quasar luminosity function at z = 2-3. Primeval galaxiesare envisaged as a collection of many interacting and merging clumps,attaining a peak luminosity that is an order of magnitude below thatachieved in models in which galaxy formation is initiated abruptly. Hence,ongoing searches for primeval galaxies would not necessarily have beensuccessful unless they are designed to find moderately low-luminosity,low-surface-brigtness extended objects at low redshift. 21 references.</TEXT></DOC>
