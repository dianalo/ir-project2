Now,most object-oriented languages have an &quot;inheritance&quot; construct. Intuitivelyone should be able to match these constructs with each other in someway. To get a feel of this the authors take one particular OO Data Model,the Binary Relationship Model and one particular OO Language, ObjectPascal, and try to express conceptual database update procedures. Theyfind the results are not very satisfying to the conceptual model designerbecause of a deep problem: one seems to need an extra level of abstractionin the OO language. The problem is not specific to the examples chosen.They discuss how it could be handled by a specific form of dynamic typing.</TEXT></DOC>
