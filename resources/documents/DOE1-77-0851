<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-77-0851 </DOCNO><TEXT>H. Hopf has introduced the use of holomorphic quadratic forms to studysurfaces with constant mean curvature in R/sup 3/. The same techniqueshave been used to study surfaces immersed in spaces forms, complex projectivespaces and also to study harmonic maps. Following Hopf's ideas we considerholomorphic type forms, that is, forms whose zeroes behave like zeroesof holomorphic forms, to study surfaces such that the norm of the meancurvature vector or of its covariant derivative satisfies some inequality.We also apply the same techniques to study maps whose tension field satisfiessimilar property.
