Computer Associates has carved out a huge business selling such software for use in managing networks of International Business Machines Corp. computers but needs to find new markets if it is to maintain its growth rate of 30% and more each year. The market for system-management software for Digital's hardware is fragmented enough that a giant such as Computer Associates should do well there.    At the same time, the market is smaller than the market for IBM-compatible software. For one thing, Digital, Maynard, Mass., has sold fewer machines. In addition, its machines are typically easier to operate, so customers require less assistance from software. </TEXT></DOC>
