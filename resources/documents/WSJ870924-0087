Mr. Rogers is one of the few black owners of an investment firm, at a time when huge public pension funds are starting to earmark some of their assets for affirmative action. Leading the way are the pension plans of Florida, Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and other cities and states that have hired firms owned by minorities or by women to manage some assets. Consultants and administrators expect such hirings to grow rapidly.    &quot;This is the proverbial tip of the iceberg,&quot; says William O. Bell, a top investment official at Florida's state pension plan, which last year committed $10 million to Mr. Rogers's firm. &quot;In another few years you'll see a lot of minority-owned businesses and a lot of pension funds looking at them.&quot;    Although many cities and states award minority-owned businesses a percentage of contracts for construction work and other services, public pension funds only recently have been targeted for affirmative-action plans. &quot;There's no public exposure to pensions, they're not flashy or sexy, so they don't come to mind as a source of business,&quot; says Ron Carrigan, program manager of the mayor's Office of Small Business in Los Angeles. &quot;The pensions are hidden, and the wheels don't squeak. But once a politician picks up on these things, it's an instant issue.&quot; The Los Angeles municipal retirement plan recently committed $25 million to Ariel.    Chicago also is encouraging the participation of minorities and women in proposals for a new management contract for the city's $100 million employees' deferred compensation plan. The city has asked that the contract proposals provide for 25% of the work to go to minorities and 5% to women. Although the requirements aren't binding, the companies making proposals, mostly insurance concerns, are trying to meet them.    The new demand for minority-owned money-management firms has been a bonanza for Ariel, founded about four years ago by Mr. Rogers, 29 years old. Since the firm began, Ariel's assets under management have grown to $217 million from $400,000. By investing in obscure, out-of-favor stocks that dominate a market niche, Ariel has produced an annualized return of 25%, compared with 20.6% in the same period for Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.    Mr. Rogers, who was a stockbroker with William Blair andamp; Co. for 2 1/2 years after graduating from Princeton University, started his firm with investments from people he knew mostly through his mother, Jewel Lafontant, a deputy solicitor general and delegate to the United Nations during the Nixon administration, and through his father, a Chicago judge. &quot;I would say to these people whom I knew socially, 'Just give me $20,000,'&quot; Mr. Rogers says. &quot;I knew these guys were worth a million dollars or more, and $20,000 wasn't going to break anyone.&quot; In six months, Mr. Rogers says, he and his partner, who has since left the firm, raised about $400,000.    Mr. Rogers faced a tougher selling job when he approached pension funds. He painstakingly courted the funds, visiting and calling fund officials, and sending them quarterly performance reports as well as copies of his investment newsletter. Today, the bulk of Ariel's assets are from pension funds, especially public ones. Mr. Rogers says that being a minority owner was an asset in many cases because of the affirmative-action programs. &quot;I needed some marketing hook to get me in the door, and I was realistic and practical enough to realize that being black might have a bearing,&quot; he says.    Some other black money managers have decided not to target the affirmative-action programs. &quot;When I started my business, I said I'm going to be colorblind in terms of seeking clients,&quot; says Ed Brown, 46, president of Brown Capital Management. &quot;Subsequently, there have been certain situations where being a black-owned firm has been an advantage, and I'm not going to turn down accounts because of that. But I'm not going to use it as a marketing tool.&quot;    Despite the spectacular growth of Ariel and a few other minority-owned firms, blacks still face formidable obstacles in entering the investment-management field. Anyone starting an investment firm has to persuade investors to entrust their funds to an unproven entity. Few blacks, however, rank as experienced money managers at large firms, able to take clients with them when they go into business on their own.    Once started, a minority-owned investment firm -- like any other new money manager -- can be at a disadvantage simply because it hasn't yet built a track record. Large public pension funds, in particular, look for money managers with several years of experience managing sizable assets. &quot;You simply can't let yourself be persuaded by social needs,&quot; says Wallace F. Sullivan, executive director of New York City's Teachers' Variable Fund.    In committing $10 million to Ariel, for instance, Florida's $14 billion fund allowed an exception to its usual criteria of five to 10 years of management experience and assets of more than $500 million.    Some minority-owned investment firms have won the business of pension plans by forming joint ventures with more established money management firms. Keith Greaves, 44, owner of Greaves Capital Management, formed such a venture with Invesco Capital Management of Atlanta, whose partners he had worked with in a previous job. Mr. Greaves's only two clients, the city of Atlanta and Pilgrim Health andamp; Life Insurance Co., are actually clients of Greaves/Invesco Capital Management. He says affiliation with Invesco, a 16-year-old firm with $13 billion under management, helps attract clients and provides financial support for the venture.    As minority-owned investment firms become more experienced, their role in managing pension funds is likely to increase. The District of Columbia's Retirement Board, for instance, recently hired three minority-owned money-management firms, including Ariel. Earl Johnson, the board's executive director, says they are part of the fund's &quot;farm team&quot; -- firms currently too small and inexperienced to be one of the fund's major outside managers. When a larger manager is dropped, he says, &quot;we'll try to call up someone from the farm team who has proven himself.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
