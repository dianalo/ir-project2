 Ardent-Stellar Computer, HP's Apollo Computer Div, SiliconGraphics Inc, and Tektronix Inc are the leading vendors in thevisualization market.andP;  Ardent officials say that finding acompiler which takes advantage of both vectors and multipleprocessors is the greatest difficulty in building high-endsystems.andP;  Bandwidth is also a major problem because current I/Othroughput rates do not allow interactive real-time applications.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Graphics SystemsVisualizationThree-Dimensional GraphicsAnalysisComputer IndustryUser NeedsWorkstations.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Users Await More Power To Fuel Visualization NeedsandM;Probably one of the biggest fallacies proliferated in the computer industrytoday is that there is no demand for high-end 3-D systems because relativelyfew of these systems have been sold.andM;But a closer look at why sales in this market segment have been slow turns upa somewhat startling conclusion given the tremendous amount of CPU horsepoweravailable today.andP;  The power of 3-D high-end graphics visualization systemsjust doesn't measure up to current real-time application needs, and manyusers say that the systems don't offer enough bang for the buck.andM;&quot;To approach the type of visualization that we have been doing in real timewill require a minimum of a gigaflop of performance with at least300MB-per-second I/O bandwidth and at least 512MB of RAM,&quot; said Kevin Hussey,technical group supervisor for the Visualization andamp; Earth Science ApplicationsGroup at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif.andM;&quot;Scientists want to move around their data sets in near real time,&quot; Husseyexplained.andM;Lately, the term &quot;visualization,&quot; which describes a field of computing thatallows the interactive visual exploration of large amounts of data, hasreached industry buzzword status.andM;&quot;Visualization is really more than how many polygons you can plow through.andO;Scientists, from their perspective, need tools that operate in this domain,&quot;said Lloyd Treinish, a computer scientist with NASA's National Space ScienceData Center at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.andM;Two key pieces that are missing from the visualization puzzle are softwarethat scientists, especially those who are not skilled programmers, can easilyuse, and software that takes full advantage of multiprocessor systems.andM;&quot;[The visualization process] needs to be iterative,&quot; Treinish said.andM;In addition, system architectures are going to have to be designed thatdramatically improve I/O throughput to disk and display in order to makeapplications truly interactive in real time.andM;&quot;If you've got huge memory bandwidth and you're talking to SCSI disks ...andO;you've got a mismatch.andP;  You can buy a Sun or DEC workstation that hasreasonable fixed- and floating-point power, [but] you have to attachrelatively slow disks,&quot; Treinish said.andM;&quot;High-performance workstations have tightly coupled CPU and memory, but theyneed higher speed to the display and disks.andP;  You can't have delays sendingdata out to disk,&quot; agreed John Dragon, a staff member at Los Alamos NationalLaboratory in New Mexico.andM;Currently, leading system vendors that are actively trying to carve out aniche in the high-end visualization market include Ardent-Stellar Computer ofNewton, Mass.; the Apollo Division of Hewlett-Packard in Chelmsford, Mass.;andO;Silicon Graphics of Mountain View, Calif.; Tektronix of Beaverton, Ore.; andAlliant Computer Systems of Littleton, Mass.andM;(As of press time, details of an Ardent-Stellar merger were unavailable--seerelated story on Page 1.)andM;According to Supercomputing--12 years and Still Going Strong, a Dataquestreport published in May, a total of 587 graphics-project supercomputer unitswere shipped by Apollo, Ardent-Stellar and Silicon Graphics last year.andM;&quot;In 1988 Apollo garnered the No.andP;  1 spot in terms of both factory revenue andunit shipments,&quot; the report said.andM;The report estimated that Apollo shipped 46.9 percent of those systems;Ardent-Stellar, 39.5 percent; and Silicon Graphics, 13.6 percent.andM;According to industry consultant Carl Machover of Machover Associates inWhite Plains, N.Y., technical workstations in general were a $3 billionmarket last year and, it is estimated, that figure will grow to $4.5 billionby next year.andM;&quot;The superworkstation market accounts for 20 percent of that market.andP;  In1988, the super graphics workstation accounted for $300 million to $600million, and should grow to $1 billion by 1990,&quot; he said.andM;In addition, Montgomery Securities, an investment research company in SanFrancisco, reports that the 3-D visualization market has twice the marketgrowth opportunity of its 2-D counterpart.andP;  Current industry estimates fortechnical users in the United States are 990,000 programmers and engineers as2-D users, and 1,850,000 scientists and engineers as 3-D users.andM;Montgomery Securities believes that the 2-D market is at present only 17percent to 20 percent saturated, whereas the 3-D market is 8.4 percent to 10percent saturated.andM;But, even though opportunities abound in the 3-D workstation market, currenthigh-end workstation technology may not be up to the task of performing thevisualization functions that are required by users.andM;According to Machover, the first generation of dynamic super graphicsworkstations simply does not provide enough speed, bandwidth and RAM.andM;NASA's Treinish noted, &quot;In the past, [visualization] was hard to define wellenough for vendors to implement.andP;  It is not just [the] generation [of] lotsof animated surfaces.andP;  You need more than computer graphics.&quot;andM;&quot;[The computer and scientific community] has done a lousy job of usingworkstations to solve scientists' problems,&quot; added Gordon Bancroft, undercontract with NASA's Ames Research Center in Mountain View, Calif.andM;&quot;The job of scientific visualization will not be [performed] by the computergraphics people alone,&quot; he asserted.andM;&quot;We must build a modular environment that allows the scientists to buildtheir own workbench&quot; that can be distributed across a large, extremelyhigh-speed network, he said.andM;Probably the best-known player in the 3-D workstation market is SiliconGraphics, which offers an entry-level 3-D workstation for $15,990.andM;Silicon Graphics markets multiprocessor workstations and servers based on theR2000 and R3000 chip sets from Mips Computer Systems of Sunnyvale, Calif.andM;In July, Silicon Graphics introduced the eight-processor 4D/280 Iris PowerCenter, which provides 160-MIPS performance and doubles the performance ofthe company's previous high-end system.andM;The 28-Mflops 4D/280 is priced at $172,000.andP;  An entry-level, two-processorconfiguration is priced at $62,500.andP;  The product's internal storage capacityis 4.8GB.andM;Silicon Graphics' Iris Power Series consists of six graphic systems andsupercomputing servers.andP;  Three are supercomputing servers that use amultiprocessing architecture, and the other three are graphics supercomputingworkstations.andM;The systems support as many as four RISC CPU/FPU chip sets and use the R3000from Mips.andP;  The Powerpath architecture can sustain 80 MIPS and 16 Mflops.andM;The midrange Professional Series systems from Silicon Graphics areRISC-based, single-processor systems with six expansion slots, a feature notoffered in the Personal Iris.andP;  Graphics are upgradable from basic graphics tographics turbo (GT).andP;  Clock speeds range from 8MHz to 16MHz.andM;The Personal Iris was the industry's first 3-D workstation to be offered at aprice of $16,000 to $25,000.andP;  The Personal Iris 4D/20 is based on the12.5MHz, 32-bit R3000 RISC processor.andP;  It delivers 10-MIPS performance andhas 8MB of main memory, eight color planes, and a 19-inch,1,280-by-1,024-pixel color monitor.andP;  The system also includes SiliconGraphics' Geometry Engines and Iris WorkSpace user interface.andM;Others in the ChaseandM;Chasing Silicon Graphics in the low end of this market are DEC, SunMicrosystems, Hewlett-Packard and Tektronix, the latter company having begunits 3-D visualization push in earnest at the Siggraph trade show held inBoston in July.andM;Known for its graphics software, Tektronix recently formed the InteractiveTechnologies Division (ITD) by combining its Graphics Workstations andGraphics Terminals divisions.andM;Tektronix entered the market too late to be a general-purpose workstationvendor and will instead focus on specific markets with its visualizationstrategy, according to Drew Davis, Tektronix's ITD marketing manager.andM;The vendor introduced a line of workstations based on Motorola's 88000 RISCprocessor in March.andP;  One member of the product family is the $34,590 XD88/303-D workstation.andM;The graphics strength of the XD88/30 is its pipelined graphics engine, whichcan draw as many as 340,000 3-D vectors per second, 450,000 2-D vectors and20,000 shaded polygons per second, according to company officials.andM;The standard system configuration includes 8MB of RAM expandable to 1176MB,1156MB of hard disk capacity and 150MB of streamer tape.andM;The XD88 product line also includes the XD88/20 2-D workstation.andP;  Inaddition, the line extends beyond workstations to include the XD88/01, a 14-to 17-MIPS applications processor for $24,950.andP;  It also includes the XD88/05,a 14- to 17-MIPS file server, which is an application processor with 1.8GB ofdisk and 2GB of streamer tape for $75,000.andM;In an effort to compete with Silicon Graphics and Tektronix, DEC currentlyrelies on its VAXstation 3520, which has two VAX CPUs and a base price of$29,950, and its VAXstation 3540, with four VAX CPUs and a price tag of$49,900.andP;  Each machine has 8MB of memory and eight color planes.andM;DEC is also expected to unveil a 3-D DECstation based on the Mips R3000 RISCchip before the end of the year.andM;&quot;The RISC-based workstation [line] will include 3-D graphics,&quot; said SusanStearman, group applications marketing manager for DEC's ScientificVisualization Group.andM;&quot;We're doing a lot of research to optimize an operating system environmentwhere application development can use multiprocessing capabilities to thebest of their advantage,&quot; Stearman said.andM;&quot;It's not sufficient to just have multiprocessing, asynchronous orsynchronous ...andP;  what's [important] is developing compilers and run-timelibraries that can take advantage of multiprocessing,&quot; she added.andM;&quot;We go with tightly coupled CPU to graphics memory.andP;  We are looking at anumber of different internal bus structures [to provide] faster and broaderbandwidth.andP;  I'm not sure we're [pursuing] higher bandwidth to disk asaggressively as [the] internal bus [effort],&quot; Stearman said.andM;Meanwhile, at Sun the strategy is to focus on packaging as many features aspossible in one workstation.andP;  &quot;The market is broadening its vision--peoplewant one workstation in front of a system that includes video connectivity,image processing, 2-D and 3-D graphics, visualization and rendering,&quot; saidBernard Peuto, vice president of Sun's graphics products division.andM;To support this strategy, Sun has begun shipping its Sun Video card,previously sold as an option, with its entire VME product line.andP;  This 24-bitcolor frame buffer is tightly coupled with the windowing system and is usedto render photographic-quality images.andP;  It accepts NTSC, S-Video, RGB andYUB, and works as a genlock encoder.andP;  Additional capabilities include freezeframe and full motion in real time.andP;  The product's list price is $12,900.andM;The Sun GXP line is configured with 8-bit color, 2-D and 3-D wireframe andsolids-modeling capabilities.andP;  All of the GXP systems are capable of drawing90,000 3-D vectors per second and 5,500 pixel-independent, Gouraud-shaded,Z-buffered polygons per second.andM;Another major player in this market is Hewlett-Packard, which offers theSeries 800.andP;  Based on the HP Precision Architecture, the series consists ofthe RISC-based 825 SRX, 825 Turbo SRX, 835 SRX and 835 Turbo SRX models.andM;As far as midrange offerings go, HP offers the 68020-based and 68030-based300 Series, comprising the 350 SRX, 350 Turbo SRX, the 360 SRX, 360 TurboSRX, 370 SRX and 370 Turbo SRX models.andM;At the low end, Hewlett-Packard offers the 68030-based 340 SRX workstation.andO;The 340 SRX is targeted at the mechanical computer-aided engineering marketand is priced at $14,900.andP;  It includes a 1,280-by-1,024-pixel color monitor,4MB of RAM (expandable to 16MB), eight bit planes and four overlay planes.andM;Elsewhere, there are several players at the very high end of the 3-Dvisualization market including Ardent-Stellar, the Apollo Division of HP andAlliant.andM;Up until last week, Ardent-Stellar offered the Titan graphics supercomputer,which uses a 64-bit parallel vector architecture that at peak processingrates can deliver 64 Mflops.andP;  The architecture also incorporates 52 imageplanes and parallel pixel processors.andM;The Titan is priced according to the number of processors.andP;  At the low end,the Unix-based Titan 1 server configuration, with one processor, 16MB and a380MB disk, has an entry price of $52,500.andP;  The graphics supercomputer,configured as the server plus graphics, has an entry price of $79,000.andP;  Forboth the server and the graphics configuration, there is an additional chargeof $20,000 for each processor.andP;  As many as four processors can be included.andM;According to Gale Aguilar, Ardent's vice president of industry marketing, thegreatest difficulty in building high-end systems that combine vectors andmultiple processors is finding a compiler that takes advantage of bothfunctions.andM;&quot;The Titan can automatically parallelize and vectorize existing code withlittle or no modification,&quot; Aguilar said.andM;Ardent-Stellar also offers the Stellar Graphics supercomputer which combinesa multistream processor, a vector processor, a rendering processor and amaximum of four I/O processors.andM;&quot;The biggest benefit of Stellar's [product] is wide bandwidth, because thecomputer spends more time moving data than crunching it,&quot; said Craig Mathias,Stellar's director of product marketing.andM;In May, Stellar introduced the 2000 Series Graphics and DepartmentalSupercomputers, which double the performance of Stellar's previous system.andM;The high-end system, the GS2500 model, has a base price of $140,000 andperforms 35 MIPS, 100 Mflops and 150,000 Gouraud-shaded, Z-buffered polygonsper second.andP;  It provides an animation rate of 30 frames per second, as wellas having a dual-user option and direct video output.andM;The GS2000 model, with the same capabilities but performing 80 Mflops, has abase price of $125,000.andP;  The GS2200, the same as the GS2000 but with 20- to25-MIPS dual-user options, has a base price of $140,000.andM;At the low end, the GS1000 offers 20 to 25 MIPS; 40 Mflops; 150,000Gouraudshaded, Z-buffered polygons per second; and 15-frame-per-secondanimation.andP;  Prices start at $90,000.andM;Apollo offers its DN10000 series but, following its acquisition by HP, thingsare scheduled to change.andP;  The two companies plan to offer a new series thatwill combine Apollo compilers with HP's Precision Architecture.andM;Beyond Ardent-Stellar and HP-Apollo in terms of system size isminisupercomputer builder Alliant, which relies on parallel processing andgraphics subsystems to support visualization applications.andM;&quot;Our design goal is to build a supercomputer with dedicated processors forgraphics and dedicated processors for computations that share applications,&quot;said Phil Neray, Alliant's visualization marketing manager.andM;Alliant's current offering, the Visualization series, is used for simulationand process control.andP;  It yields computation performance up to 377 Mflops andgraphic performance up to 640 Mflops.andM;The series can be upgraded from the low end, supporting four graphic displaysand 16 computational users, to the high end, handling 16 graphic displays and128 computational users.andM;Prices range from $150,000 for the low-end VFX/4 model performing 47.2Mflops, to $1.2 million to $1.8 million for the high-end VFX/82 rated at 377Mflops.andM;&quot;Alliant provides, in one system, parallel vector supercomputing, integrated3-D graphics running the Phigs standard, and applications in Unix,&quot; Neraysaid.andM;No matter how well the high-end workstations perform, visualization willremain the purview of computer specialists until the required softwarebecomes more easy to use and more generalized.andM;One area that needs to be specifically addressed is data management.andM;&quot;If you can't organize your data, you can't gain access to it to apply it tovisualization,&quot; NASA's Treinish said.andM;&quot;Over the last year, we've started to see bits and pieces.andP;  At the low end[for example] is Stellar's AVS.andP;  The data-flow paradigm seems to beappropriate to many problems,&quot; he added.andM;Stellar's Application Visualization System lets users build applications byconnecting modules that perform functions such as data input, filtering, datatransformation, geometry conversion and rendering.andM;&quot;AVS release 1 allows the user to view his data; AVS release 2 allows him tobuild true real-time applications, not just do post-processing,&quot; Stellar'sMathias said.andM;He added that Stellar intends to make AVS available for licensing on otherplatforms, though no licensing agreements have been signed yet.andM;Another sophisticated graphics software package is Ardent's Dynamic ObjectRendering Environment (DORE).andP;  &quot;DORE is a graphics environment that maintainsa hierarchical database of a dynamic scene,&quot; Ardent's Aguilar explained.andM;In general, though, system vendors need to update compilers in order to takefull advantage of operating systems that support multiprocessing.andM;According to NASA's Treinish, many of the multiprocessing high-endworkstations are analogous to the early multiheaded VAXes or currentDECsystems where the operating system does not automatically balance theload.andP;  &quot;The user has to do it himself.andP;  Unless this becomes more transparent,it will keep people away.andP;  I think a lot of the hardware vendors realizethis,&quot; he said.andM;Finally, using networks as a vehicle to distribute visualization applicationsis another hurdle that must be overcome.andM;&quot;There is a need for distributed visualization capabilities where elements ofvisualization are performed on different platforms,&quot; Stellar's Reid said.andM;&quot;I would like to see some kind of tiered or hierarchical approach todistribute computation,&quot; Treinish said.andM;On the hardware front, users can expect to see increased use of video andbetter resolution.andP;  &quot;Direct video interface [DVI] and compression of imagesare blurring the lines between computer graphics and imaging, so in thefuture the differentiation between raster and vector will go away,&quot;consultant Machover said.andM;He predicted that &quot;we will see a new class of raster systems that areobject-based and that will make picture manipulation easier.&quot; As a result, hesaid, users can expect to have object-based pictures with object-orienteddatabases.andM;Displays will also improve in the near future, according to RichardMirabella, director of marketing at Sony Microsystems in Palo Alto, Calif.andM;&quot;The trend will be to include higher-performance displays at approximately2,000-by-1,500-pixel resolution, which means that in the future, 3-Dworkstation monitors will be equipped with faster graphic controllers,&quot;Mirabella said.andP;  &quot;These controllers will provide 190MHz for a2,000-by-1,500-pixel display, more than double the 80MHz scan rate of today's1,024-by-1,280-pixel display.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
