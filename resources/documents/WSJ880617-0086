The Saudi-Texaco alliance, if completed, would represent by far the biggest move yet by a member of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to the gasoline pump.    &quot;The size of this deal is staggering,&quot; said Antonio Szabo of Bonner andamp; Moore, Houston, an industry consulting concern. &quot;Both in the magnitude and complexity of the assets, it is absolutely unprecedented.&quot;    The transaction would give the crude-rich Saudis a secure market and crude-short Texaco a secure supply -- as well as, perhaps, a few more votes in a proxy fight that is due to reach a climax at Texaco's board meeting in Tulsa, Okla., today.    &quot;I'd call it an election-eve event,&quot; said an adviser to Carl Icahn, Texaco's largest holder, who is leading a fight to obtain five board seats at the meeting.    In White Plains, a Texaco spokesman pointed out that negotiations with the Saudis had been under way for months and said the timing of the announcement was coincidental.    It couldn't be learned whether Texaco's letter of intent gives the Saudis a way out if Texaco's management loses control of the company to Mr. Icahn.    Mr. Icahn said he was delighted that the proposed asset sale might facilitate his $60-a-share takeover offer for the company. &quot;I'm in favor of anything good for the company,&quot; Mr. Icahn said. &quot;If they do a good Saudi deal, it makes my financing easier.&quot;    And outwardly, at least, the proposed accord seems to be a good one for Texaco as well as the Saudis. In exchange for the specified Texaco assets in 23 states -- those east of the Mississippi River plus Texas, Louisiana and parts of Oklahoma -- the kingdom will pay $800 million and will contribute about 22.5 million barrels of crude oil currently valued at about $400 million.    &quot;It's really a very fair deal,&quot; Mr. Szabo of Bonner andamp; Moore said. &quot;The dollar value looks very equitable.&quot;    Texaco also figured that by having a partner to share the working capital and other expenses, it would realize an additional one-time savings of about $800 million, raising the value of the transaction for Texaco to $2 billion.    The transaction, which Texaco expects to complete by year's end, could have a wider significance for world oil markets -- partly by making them more volatile than ever. The joint venture would have the right to buy as much as 600,000 barrels of oil a day -- practically the entire capacity of the three refineries -- from Saudi Arabia at what the parties called &quot;prevailing market prices.&quot;    Texaco wouldn't elaborate. But Thomas Q. Shultz, president of Saudi Refining Inc., Texaco's intended joint-venture partner, said the venture would designate a &quot;marker&quot; crude oil, such as Alaska North Slope, North Sea Brent or Dubai crudes, and would adjust the price it pays Saudi Arabia in line with the fluctuations in the price of that &quot;marker&quot; crude.    This means that nearly 15% of Saudi Arabia's current production of about four million barrels a day would be traded on the basis of rapidly fluctuating market prices rather than under the &quot;fixed&quot; OPEC pricing system.    The proposed arrangement could only benefit consumers, many industry specialists said. Texaco controls about 8% of the gasoline market in most of the 23 states included in the arrangement, and the Saudis can be expected to take whatever steps are necessary to defend that share.    &quot;The consumer will see lower prices,&quot; said Norman Higby, a Menlo Park, Calif., energy forecaster who has been predicting such a Saudi-Texaco accord for nearly two years.    In fact, other major oil companies and oil-exporting nations may have no choice but to follow suit. &quot;Chevron is next,&quot; said Mr. Higby, who identified Venezuela and Mexico as possible joint-venture partners for that oil concern. Daniel Yergin, president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, said, &quot;This will shake the dust from the boots of other exporters -- and a lot of companies.&quot;    But Texaco and the Saudis are unlikely to touch off major gasoline price wars throughout the East -- a move that would almost certainly invite antitrust scrutiny. &quot;That issue is so enormous that both parties in this transaction will be very sensitive to the legal and commercial pitfalls,&quot; Mr. Yergin said.    The months of intensive talks on the joint venture followed at least three years of discreet contact between Texaco and Saudi officials, according to a consultant to the Saudis. For about 50 years, Texaco has been a member of the Arabian American Oil Co. consortium, along with Exxon Corp., Mobil Corp. and Chevron -- companies whose demands for Saudi crude may now come second to Texaco's.    Only Chevron had a comment on the Texaco-Saudi announcement. &quot;Chevron has had a mutually beneficial 50-year relationship with the Saudis, and we wouldn't anticipate this development having any impact on this relationship one way or the other,&quot; a spokesman said.    Assets involved in the proposed sale include the Texaco trademark on gasoline, home heating oil and diesel fuel in the East. In addition, the joint venture would acquire 1,540 service stations owned or leased by Texaco and a contract or other arrangement to supply about 10,000 other stations.    The refineries that propose to contribute to the venture are Texaco's huge Port Arthur, Texas, plant; its refinery at Convent, La., which has recently undergone a major upgrading; and its plant at Delaware City, Del., which was acquired along with the rest of Getty Oil Co. in 1984. No significant layoffs among the plants' 4,500 workers are envisioned.    The Delaware City plant was built by J. Paul Getty to process crude oil from the so-called Neutral Zone, a strip of land administered by Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Mr. Getty acquired rights to Neutral Zone production and built the plant to try to offset the strength of Texaco and the other companies in the Arabian American consortium.    ---   Allanna Sullivan contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
