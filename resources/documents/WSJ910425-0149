The attack, apparently by Germany's radical leftist RedArmy Faction, killed Detlev Karsten Rohwedder, the58-year-old head of the Berlin Treuhandanstalt, the trustagency set up last year to transform East Germany into amarket economy.</LP><TEXT>   The murder comes at a time when a crisis atmospherealready hovers over the agency, as well as over the regionit's supposed to help salvage from economic chaos. In recentweeks, east Germans have poured onto the streets to protestthe Treuhand's efforts to close hundreds of unproductiveeastern factories. For a nation struggling to complete thecomplex task of unification, Mr. Rohwedder's assassinationadds to a growing sense of anxiety.   &quot;Without Rohwedder, the difficult task of economicrebuilding in {eastern Germany} will be more difficult toaccomplish,&quot; said a grim Franz Steinkuehler, head ofGermany's powerful IG Metall steelworkers union.   Analysts disagree on whether the assassination might slowinvestment in eastern Germany. More troubling, they said, isthe labor unrest there. If it continues, investors couldsteer away from eastern Germany even more than they alreadyare.   Only six months ago, the two Germanys eagerly completedtheir merger into a single nation. But while nobody saidmelding together two such different societies and economieswould be easy, few predicted the depth of the problems thathave emerged. Unemployment in Germany's eastern half isexpected to hit 50%, setting the stage for what many fearcould be a &quot;hot summer&quot; of urban unrest.   Mr. Rohwedder's murder also has stirred up fears about anew wave of terrorism inside the united nation. Another majorarchitect of Germany's economy, Deutsche Bank AG chief AlfredHerrhausen, was killed by a Red Army Faction bomb attack inNovember 1989. This February, the group claimedresponsibility for an assault on the U.S. Embassy here inwhich the building was raked with 250 rifle shots. No one wasinjured.   Some Germans believe the attack on Mr. Rohwedder is partof a larger effort by Bonn's enemies to complicate theunification process. Manfred Stolpe, governor of the easternGerman state of Brandenburg, said the murder was &quot;a dangeroussignal that political criminals want to exploit&quot; theunsettled mood in the eastern part of the nation.   German television reported suspicions that members offormer East Germany's hated secret police force, the Stasi,may have aided in the attack on Mr. Rohwedder. Bonn officialsacknowledge that the attack on Mr. Rohwedder contained&quot;unusual elements,&quot; but they say they have no evidence tosuggest a Stasi link.   Police combing the area around Mr. Rohwedder's housediscovered a pair of binoculars and a letter claimingresponsibility for the Red Army Faction in a vacant lot. Mr.Rohwedder's wife was shot in the arm as she tried to aid herhusband, but officials say her wound isn't life-threatening.The Rohwedders were known for their refusal to live behindsecurity barriers, even though his job made them likelytargets of terrorists. The family's telephone number islisted in the Duesseldorf directory together with theirstreet address, and the house was relatively open to thestreet.   For the Treuhandanstalt, there have been signs of troublealmost from the beginning. By the end of last year, theagency was on its third chief executive. Reiner Gohlke, thefirst westerner to head the agency, quit after only fiveweeks. Many believe Mr. Rohwedder was pressured by his closefriend, Chancellor Helmut Kohl, to succeed Mr. Gohlke. InNovember, he agreed to a full four-year term at the agency,which serves as a holding company for 8,000 state-owned firmsin eastern Germany, as well as for most of the region's farmsand forests.   As head of the agency, Mr. Rohwedder was a magnet forcriticism from all sides. Eastern Germans complained he wasthrowing people out of work by ruthlessly cutting subsidiesto crumbling factories, while western Germans grumbled aboutthe spiraling costs of the eastern bailout.   Nevertheless, few men were better suited to the job ofturning around the moribund economy of eastern Germany thanMr. Rohwedder. Born in Thuringia, a region in easternGermany, the tall industrialist often cited his backgroundwhen explaining why he accepted the job. &quot;I've always feltstrongly and emotionally about the division of Germany,&quot; hesaid in an interview shortly before his death, &quot;not in anationalistic sense, but in the same way an American mightfeel if his country had been divided along the MissouriRiver.&quot;   Mr. Rohwedder earned his reputation as a corporateturnaround artist in the 1980s, when he steered thestruggling German steelmaker Hoesch back towardprofitability. He also was one of the few leading Germanindustrialists with extensive experience in government. From1969 to 1978, he was a leading official in Bonn's EconomicsMinistry, where, among other things, he was responsible forWest Germany's economic relations with former East Germany.   In the interview, Mr. Rohwedder said he didn't feelbothered by the heavy criticism his job at the Treuhand drew.Mr. Rohwedder admitted that one of the main qualificationsfor his job was to &quot;be a tough guy, and someone who doesn'tget nervous if the environment around you gets mad andhysterical.&quot;   That's a good description of conditions in former EastGermany. For the past month, protesters have taken to thestreets in weekly Monday-night marches, echoing the unrestthat toppled the nation's Communist leadership in 1989 andled to the opening of the Berlin Wall. East Germans have evenvowed to march on Bonn in June. And last week, theTreuhandanstalt's Berlin offices were firebombed.   In what became Mr. Rohwedder's last internal communicationto his staff, he warned that the agency would face heavycriticism in coming months. &quot;But hostility and slander arenot criticism and should not concern us,&quot; he wrote.</TEXT></DOC>
