<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-50-0279 </DOCNO><TEXT>The FORTRAN program LYRAN has been written for use in analyzing the beamdynamics of superconducting heavy ion linacs. The program is based onthe program LYRA developed by A.H. Scholldorf at SUNY Stony Brook, butthat original program has been extensively extended, modified, and restructured.LYRAN transports a group of input particles randomly distributed on aselected distribution function through linac elements which include rfaccelerating and bunching elements, dipole and quadrupole magnets, electrostaticelements, and drift spaces. Second order corrections to dipole and quadrupolefields are included. A nonlinear optimization routine is incorporated,providing fast and efficient determination of accelerator configurationsand parameter settings that provide desired beam properties. Beam envelopeplotting is also included to provide a graphic display of beam characteristics.</TEXT></DOC>
