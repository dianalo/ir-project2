SectionS5.3.2 of the standard requires that the brake system indicator lamps beactivated automatically when the vehicle is started, to check whether thelamp bulbs are burned out. That section also provides that in vehiclesequipped with an automatic transmission, the activation as a check of lampfunction is not required when the transmission shift lever is in a forwardor reverse drive position, since the vehicle cannot be started when thetransmission shift lever is in those positions. This notice proposes toamend the standard to provide that the activation as a check of lamp functionis not required under any condition in which a vehicle cannot be starteddue to operation of an interlock switch. This rulemaking results from apetition for rulemaking submitted by Mazda.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Comments must be received on or before October 17, 1988.The proposed requirements would be effective 30 days after publicationof a final rule in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES: </T2>Comments should refer to the docket and notice numbersand be submitted to: Docket Section, National Highway Traffic Safety Administration,Room 5109, 400 Seventh Street, SW., Washington, DC 20590.

SectionS5.3.2 of the standard requires that the brake system indicator lamps beactivate automatically when the vehicle is started, to provide a checkof lamp function. That section reads as follows:<ITAG tagnum="21">All indicator lamps shall be activated as a check of lamp functioneither when the ignition (start) switch is turned to the ``on'' (run) positionwhen the enigne is not running, or when the ignition (start) switch isin a position between ``on'' (run) and ``start'' that is designated bythe manufacturer as a check position. However, in vehicles equipped withan automatic transmission, the activation as a check of lamp function isnot required when the transmission shift lever is in a forward or reversedrive position.</ITAG>The second sentence of section S5.3.2 was not originally included in StandardNo. 105. In adding the sentence, NHTSA stated the following:<ITAG tagnum="21">* * * Toyota Motor Sales, Inc., has requested confirmation that S5.3.2of the standard requires a check of the brake system indicator lamp functiononly when the transmission shift lever is in the ``P'' (park) or ``N''(neutral) position (in the case of vehicles with automatic transmission).The literal wording of S5.3.2 requires a check of lamp function withoutregard to the position of the transmission shift lever, whenever the ignitionswitch is turned to the ``on'' position when the engine is not running,or when the ignition switch is in a position between ``on'' and ``start''that is designated by the manufacturer as a check position. In the caseof vehicles with an automatic transmission, however, this wording doesnot reflect the NHTSA's intent with respect to check function. To properlyreflect this intent, the language of S5.3.2 is hereby modified in accordancewith Toyota's request * * *. 40 FR 42872, September 27, 1975.</ITAG>NHTSA notes that since the purpose of section S5.3.2 of Standard No. 105was to provide an automatic check of lamp function each time the vehiclewas started, it was unnecessary to require the check function in situationswhere the vehicle could not be started. Standard No. 102, <T3>Transmission Shift Lever Sequence, Starter Interlock, and TransmissionBraking Effect, </T3>requires for vehicles equipped with automatic transmissionthat the engine starter be inoperative when the transmission shift leveris in a forward or reverse drive position. Since vehicle equipped withautomatic transmission could not be started when the transmission shiftlever is in a forward or reverse drive position, it was unnecessary torequire the check function when the transmission shift lever is in eitherof those positions.Mazda submitted a petition for rulemaking requesting an amendment of sectionS5.3.2's provision limiting the conditions under which the lamp check functionmust be provided. That company stated that the provision, which now appliesonly to vehicles equipped with automatic tranmissions, should also applyto manual tranmission vehicles which are equipped with a clutch pedal interlockswitch. Mazda stated that this type of interlock switch prevents the enginefrom starting unless the clutch pedal is fully depressed, and is analogousto the starter interlock required by Standard No. 102 for vehicles equippedwith automatic transmissions. Mazda also asserted that overall cost effectiveness, and to a lesser degree,safety, would be enhanced by its requested amendment. According to thepetitioner, the amendment would enable manufacturers to employ a singlewiring harness for the brake system indicator lamp circuit for vehiclesequipped with both manual and automatic transmissions. That company statedthat it currently designs, produces and installs two separate brake systemindicator lamp harnesses, one for manual transmission vehicles and theother for automatic transmission vehicles, which results in unnecessaryadditional costs. Mazda also stated that its requested amendment wouldprovide an incentive for manufacturers to provide clutch pedal starterinterlock switches for vehicles not so currently equipped. That companystated that unexpected motion of the vehicle during engine activation wouldbe reduced as the clutch pedal would be depressed more often in a widervariety of vehicles prior to engine activation.NHTSA agrees with the petitioner that, for purposes of section S5.3.2'sprovision limiting the conditions under which the lamp check function mustbe provided, a clutch pedal interlock switch for manual transmission vehiclesis analogous to the starter interlock required by Standard No. 102 forvehicles equippped with automatic transmissions. Since the purpose of sectionS5.3.2 of Standard No. 105 is to provide an automatic check of lamp functionseach time the vehicle is started, the agency tentatively concludes thatit is unnecessary to require the check function under any condition wherea vehicle cannot be started due to operation of an interlock switch. Theagency therefore grants Mazda's petition and is proposing to amend StandardNo. 105 accordingly. NHTSA believes that the proposed amendment would increasemanufacturer flexibility without any adverse impact on safety.Since the proposed amendment would impose no new requirements but wouldinstead increase manufacturer flexibility by relieving a restriction, theagency is proposing that the amendment become effective 30 days after publicationof a final rule.The agency has analyzed this proposal and determined that it is neither``major'' within the meaning of Executive Order 12291 nor ``significant''within the meaning of the Department of Transportation regulatory policiesand procedures. The agency has determined that the economic effects ofthe proposed amendment would be so minimal that a full regulatory evaluationis not required. Since the proposed amendment would impose no new requirementsbut simply permit additional flexibility in the design of the wiring harnessesfor brake system indicator lamps, any cost impacts would be in the natureof small, nonquantifiable cost savings.In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act, NHTSA has evaluatedthe effects of this section on small entities. Based upon this evaluation,I certify that the proposed amendment would not have a significant economicimpact on a substantial number of small entities. Small businesses, smallorganizations, and small governmental units would be affected by the proposedamendment only to the extent that they purchase motor vehicles. For thereasons discussed above, the amendments would not significantly affectvehicle price. Accordingly, no regulatory flexibility analysis has beenprepared.The agency has also analyzed this proposed rule for the purposes of theNational Environmental Policy Act, and detemined that the proposed rulewould not have any significant impact on the quality of the human environment.Finally, this proposed rule has been analyzed in accordance with the principlesand criteria contained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determinedthat the proposed rule does not have sufficient federalism implicationsto warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.Interested persons are invited to submit comments on the proposal. It isrequested but not required that 10 copies be submitted. All comments must not exceed 15 pages in length. (49 CFR 533.21). Necessaryattachments may be appended to these submissions without regard to the15-page limit. This limitation is intended to encourage commenters to detailtheir primary arguments in a concise fashion. If a commenter wishes to submit certain information under a claim of confidentiality,three copies of the complete submission, including purportedly confidentialbusiness information, should be submitted to the Chief Counsel, NHTSA,at the street address given above, and seven copies from which the purportedlyconfidential information has been deleted should be submitted to the DocketSection. A request for confidentiality should be accompanied by a coverletter setting forth the information specified in the agency's confidentialbusiness information regulation. 49 CFR Part 512.All comments received before the close of business on the comment closingdate indicated above for the proposal will be considered, and will be availablefor examination in the docket at the above address both before and afterthat date. To the extent possible, comments filed after the closing datewill also be considered. Comments received too late for consideration inregard to the final rule will be considered as suggestions for furtherrulemaking action. Comments on the proposal will be available for inspectionin the docket. The NHTSA will continue to file relevant information asit becomes available in the docket after the closing date, and it is recommendedthat interested persons continue to examine the docket for new material.Those persons desiring to be notified upon receipt of their comments inthe rules docket should enclose a self-addressed, stamped postcard in theenvelope with their comments. Upon receiving the comments, the docket supervisorwill return the postcard by mail.A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations.
