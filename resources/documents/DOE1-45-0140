MoAb scanning depicted nine of 16 primary colorectalcarcinomas on planar scintigrams (true-positive findings = 56%) and tenof 16 lesions on single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans(true-positive findings = 62%). Liver metastases were detected in threeof three patients, and lymph node metastases were detected in one offour patients. Immunohistochemical examination for CEA in resected colorectalcancer tissues demonstrated a positive correlation between MoAb imagingof primary lesions and cytoplasmic-stromal intracellular CEA distribution.There was no correlation between CEA serum levels and lesion detectabilitywith MoAb scanning.</TEXT></DOC>
