The problem is her English.    &quot;Some people, if no speak all English -- they don't receive residency,&quot; says the feisty, petite housekeeper. And that's wrong, she believes. &quot;I lived here for a long time, honey,&quot; she explains.    Indeed, Mrs. Vasquez and thousands of other newly legalized immigrants could slip back into illegality -- and an uncertain future in this country -- unless they start taking steps toward becoming citizens, especially learning basic English, within 30 months of obtaining temporary legal status.    Many may not. As the midnight Wednesday deadline nears to apply for the first step of the amnesty program, there are formidable hurdles still facing some 1.3 million eligible immigrants.    Under the historic immigration-reform law of 1986, procedures were established for the first time providing temporary-residency status for illegals who could prove they had lived in the U.S. since 1982. After 18 months of temporary legal status, immigrants have one year to obtain permanent residency by passing an English language and U.S. civics test administered by the Immigration and Naturalization Service, or showing the agency that they have taken sufficient classes in those subjects.    And even among those that meet the qualifications and become permanent residents, evidence is strong that many will never take the third and final step of becoming American citizens.    It is the first time in U.S. history that the federal government has made language and civics a requirement of permanent residency, as well as of citizenship. An INS official says the agency is considering allowing immigrants who fail the tests a second chance. But if today's crop of temporary legal immigrants don't make the conversion to permanent status, they lose their legal protection and become deportable.    About 85% of all amnesty applicants are of Hispanic origin. Among Hispanic and other political leaders, concern is mounting that the barriers to permanent residency, and, ultimately, to citizenship, may weaken the wave of new Latino voters that the law was expected to unleash. &quot;I don't expect to see a massive run for naturalization in the 1990s,&quot; says Michael Zamba, a legislative advocate of the National Assocation of Latino Elected Officials, which has launched &quot;second-step&quot; campaigns to help the former illegals complete the transition to citizenship. &quot;We'll have to wait until the year 2000.&quot;    But planning for this second-stage conversion has been halting. Several school districts are lamenting the lack of funds for new English and civics classes. The overworked INS is still circulating drafts of proposed regulations defining guidelines for English comprehension and what even constitutes acceptable courses in language or civics. And immigrant-rights advocates and the INS, while battling each other over the details of the first step of the new law, have been slow to promote the importance of education in the second step.    &quot;It's unfortunate but it seems as though the overwhelming majority, 85% . . . of temporary residency applicants, are unaware&quot; of the language and civics rules, says Domingo Rodriguez, head of the nation's largest amnesty and citizenship preparation program at the Los Angeles Unified School District.    Efforts to guide the newly legalized all the way to citizenship are strongest in Los Angeles, where a third of the nation's temporary-resident applications have been filed. At the Los Angeles school district, class sizes have expanded, waiting lists for English classes have reached 18,000, and Mr. Rodriguez is planning for &quot;the biggest back-to-school movement in the nation's history,&quot; because he expects many immigrants to continue in adult education.    Already, a plethora of &quot;easy English&quot; courses -- charging as much as $1,300 -- are popping up, joining the often shady industry of amnesty &quot;consultants.&quot; The INS's draft definition of what is a &quot;recognized&quot; course of study would eliminate many fly-by-night and correspondence courses now being patronized by immigrants. According to the INS official, an affidavit certifying a minimum of 30 hours schooling in both English and civics from a recognized instructor is sufficient.    During a class break at the Huntington Park Adult High School, Eduardo Ruiz, a 28-year-old veal butcher with a sixth-grade education, says he's confident he'll pass the INS exams. But his wife may have difficulty, he says. &quot;I practice English at the house with her all the time,&quot; he says in Spanish. &quot;I tell her, 'tell me that in English' and sometimes she can't.&quot;    Unlike the problems of reaching permanent residency, a key barrier to citizenship, especially for Hispanics, is self-imposed. Many Hispanic immigrants see U.S. citizenship as the final severing of loyalty to their homelands. As a result, legal immigrants from Latin America have historically had the slowest rate of application for U.S. citizenship, Mr. Zamba of the Latino elected officials organization says.    Mexicans, for example, spend 14 years on average in the holding pattern of permanent residency before becoming citizens. Mrs. Vasquez of Houston, for one, while thoroughly intent on becoming a permanent resident, is equally unenthusiastic about citizenship. &quot;If I become a citizen,&quot; she explains, &quot;I feel like I don't like Mexico any more.&quot;    Mexico doesn't make it easy for people like Mrs. Vasquez either, because it doesn't recognize dual citizenship.    The tug of the homeland, with its border so close, pulls hard. Aurora De Tres, a 49-year-old Mexican-American, waited 20 years before she finally took her citizenship classes last year at Casa Aztlan, a community center in Chicago replete with murals depicting Mexican-American and Mexican history.    And when she did naturalize, she celebrated by attending Mexican Independence Day festivities. As a band struck up the Mexican national anthem, guilt swept over her. &quot;I felt bad because I was a U.S. citizen,&quot; she recalls, dabbing her tears with a peach-colored tissue.    On paper, at least, the amnesty provisions of the immigration law could swell the Hispanic voting-eligible population in the U.S. by one million, to 14 million, by 1994 when the newly legalized will have fulfilled the five-year permanent residency requirement for citizenship. But the initial euphoria among some political activists now appears to have been excessively optimistic.    For example, in the Los Angeles area a voting rights movement -- demanding the right to cast absentee votes in Mexico -- is gathering momentum among legal immigrants. And while the U.S. presidential race heats up, some legal residents are holding demonstrations and raising money for national elections in Mexico.    &quot;I have not lost my roots,&quot; says Mike Almaraz as he demonstrated against Mexico's ruling party outside a Latino leadership banquet in Ontario, Calif. </TEXT></DOC>
