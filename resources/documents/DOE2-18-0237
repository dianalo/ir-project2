The mainpurpose of this paper is to present results of a uniaxial creep studyon Devonian oil shale, a material which differs considerably from theGreen River Formation shale in appearance and composition. Constant stresscreep tests were conducted, and the experimental data was modeled bya power function of time. A multiple integral form of nonlinear viscoelasticconstitutive equation was utilized, and prediction curves were formulatedbased on the experimental data. Organic content, determined by FisherAssay, was found to be an important parameter in the model. A predictioncurve for two-step loading was formulated using a product form approximationof the kernel functions. The Devonian oil shale used in these tests wasfrom the project hole designated ODOE Shawnee State Forest No. 1, ShawneeState Forest Headquarters, Friendship, Scioto County, Ohio.</TEXT></DOC>
