Gary Kelsey (hereinafter jointlyreferred to as ``respondents''). The proposed consent order has been placed on the public record for sixty(60) days for reception of comments by interested persons. Comments receivedduring this period will become part of the public record. After sixty (60)days, the Commission will again review the agreement and the comments receivedand will decide whether it should withdraw from the agreement or make finalthe agreement's proposed order. Respondents manufacture and distribute a retrofit device called the Alter-BreakSystem (``ABS''). The ABS disengages the alternator during period of acceleration,thereby momentarily decreasing the load on the engine. Respondents claimthat fuel savings and increased engine performance will result from thisdecreased engine load. A complaint prepared for issuance by the Commission together with the proposedconsent order references the following six claims made by respondents andalleges that they are false and misleading: (1) That the ABS increasesgas mileage from 12-28%; (2) That the ABS, through increased fuel economy,``will pay for itself in only a few months;'' (3) That the ABS has beenendorsed by the Department of Energy; (4) That the ABS has been endorsedby the Department of Commerce; (5) That the Department of Energy has conductedscientific tests on the ABS which substantiate a gas mileage increase of24%; and (6) That the Department of Commerce has conducted scientific testson the ABS which substantiate a gas mileage increase of 24%. In addition,it is alleged that at the time the claims were being made, respondentsalso misrepresented, directly or by implication, that they possessed andrelied upon a reasonable basis for the claims. The proposed consent order (``Order'') is designed to prevent respondentsfrom making any statistical fuel savings claims for the ABS unless theypossess competent and reliable scientific evidence to support the claims.In addition to this general restriction, the Order: (1) Prevents respondentsfrom making fuel savings claims using the phrase ``up to,'' or words ofsimilar import unless an appreciable number of consumers can achieve themaximum stated level of fuel savings or performance; (2) prevents respondentsfrom making unsubstantiated claims that the device, through increased fuelsavings, will pay for itself within a certain time period; and (3) requiresthe respondents to display a specified disclaimer along with any fuel savingsor performance claims. Additionally, the Order prevents respondents from misrepresenting, directlyor by implication, that any governmental agency has approved the ABS systemfor sale to the public or that the government has confirmed the fuel savingsclaims being made. The purpose of this analysis is to facilitate public comment on the proposedorder, and it is not intended to constitute an official interpretationof the agreement and proposed order or to modify in any way their terms.<ITAG tagnum="6">Donald S.
