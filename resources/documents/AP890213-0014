(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   People who predict the future willhave to reveal their past if officials in this gambling resort gettheir way.   City council last week unanimously passed a measure to requirepalm readers to undergo a criminal check, fingerprinting andpositive identification when they go for their annual license. Thecity currently charges a $400 license fee for readers to practicetheir trade.   ``The city can't deal in morality, but it can regulate thingsbetter,'' said Councilwoman Louise Palmentieri, who proposed themeasure. The council will take a final vote Wednesday.   Many established readers support the effort.   ``People come in here to work for a couple of months, and wedon't know who they really are,'' said Sam Mitchell, part of apalm-reading family that has operated here for more than 50 years.``We want the tighter restrictions. It gives us the bestprotection.''   Sharon Annette, a Boardwalk phrenologist _ someone who claims todetect character traits in the shape of a person's skull _ said thelegalization of gambling 10 years ago has increased demand forfortune tellers' services and the need for tougher licensingregulations.   ``We get a lot of bus people who want a reading to see how theirluck is running,'' she said. ``Most of Atlantic City's readers havebeen here for a long time. But since the casinos came, a lot of new(readers) came in.''   Altantic City required non-resident workers to register with thecity from 1953 to 1972, but it was dropped after civil rights groupscomplained it violated individuals' rights, Police Chief JosephPasquale said.   ``It was a good system, though, because we found people who werewanted for murder in other states,'' Pasquale said.</TEXT></DOC>
