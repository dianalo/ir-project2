Brown IIIStaff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 05/18/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> PIE TEX U AEG AMR NWA DAL TWAAIRLINES (AIR)TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT (TRN) </IN><TEXT>   In March, only 56.9% of all Continental Airlines' flights arrived within 15 minutes of schedule. During the same month, Piedmont Airlines Flight 17 from Boston to Newark left precisely on time just once. And USAir canceled 494 March flights.    For several years, airlines haven't released such performance figures. But partly because of an airline slip-up, some revealing on-time figures have become available at the Department of Transportation. Although incomplete, the data suggest the industry's troubles with delays are more widespread than previously thought -- and more severe.    Even airlines that tout their on-time performance have less-than-stellar records; at American Airlines, only 59.9% of all flights from the beginning of March 1986 through March 1987 arrived within 15 minutes of scheduled arrival -- the industry's standard for being on time. In fact, of the six carriers whose figures for that 13-month period were released, none had an on-time arrival performance exceeding 70.2%.    &quot;The numbers are extremely poor,&quot; says Chris Witkowski, director of the Aviation Consumer Action Project, a Ralph Nader-affiliated group. &quot;It is pretty shocking that delays are that widespread.&quot;    The new documents, along with interviews with airline executives, also provide insights into the industry's scheduling practices and the causes behind cancellations and delays. Airlines have traditionally blamed weather, the air-traffic control system, and mechanical breakdowns. But in many cases, the airlines are at fault.    At USAir, for example, crew scheduling caused more delays than maintenance foul-ups in March, the latest month for which figures are available. Piedmont says up to a quarter of its delays are within its control; some flights, for instance, are held up by slow baggage transfers and ticket processing or by late-arriving passengers.    What's more, the documents show what many travelers have long suspected: Airline schedules are consistently wrong on many flights. That happens partly because scheduling is subject to so many variables; American's filing calls it &quot;as much an art form as it is an exacting computer printout.&quot; But some carriers also admit they distort schedules to stay competitive.    Many airlines are taking steps to improve performance -- and they say those efforts are paying off. Piedmont formed a special committee last fall to address delays; it says its on-time performance has improved 20% this year. And this month, American added 150 hours of daily scheduled flight time to make its schedules more reliable.    Such improvements can't come soon enough. Airline delays rose 25% last year and passenger complaints about delays nearly tripled last month from a year ago, says the Transportation Department. Several Congressmen have proposed bills that would make on-time records public. And the transportation agency launched a sweeping probe into the industry's delays.    The lastest disclosures are an outgrowth of that probe. Already, the Department of Transportation has accused Delta Airlines and Eastern Airlines of engaging in &quot;unrealistic&quot; scheduling at Atlanta's Hartsfield Airport. The carriers deny this, but the government has expanded its probe. It has asked several other airlines to turn over their on-time records at Dallas-Fort Worth, Chicago's O'Hare and Boston's Logan airports.    Much of that data is sealed, or buried in computer tapes that aren't readily accessible to the public. But Piedmont and USAir provided performance records for thousands of their flights out of Boston and some other cities.    And to the dismay of competitors, USAir released a monthly survey comparing its punctuality with that of five other carriers during a 13-month period through this past March. Piedmont also disclosed a weekly survey of the on-time performances at eight carriers in a recent six-week period. Competitors say they shared such data on a confidential basis, but USAir says it thought it couldn't seal the information; a Transportation Department official says it could have. Piedmont, meanwhile, concedes its survey slipped into the public record by mistake.    &quot;It's a big screw-up,&quot; says Gordon Bethune, senior vice president of operations for Piedmont. (No airline disputed the data, although Eastern, Northwest and Trans World Airlines wouldn't publicly confirm it.)    In any case, the results from both surveys are hardly flattering -- particularly during some weeks. For the seven days ended March 4, five of the eight airlines were late on at least 49% of their arrivals. Northwest met its schedule only 43% of the time that week. And for the seven days ended March 25, TWA's on-time reliability fell to 49% from 62% the prior week.    The performance records at USAir and Piedmont provide further evidence that schedules for some flights bear little resemblance to reality. USAir Flight 42 from Pittsburgh to Boston arrived at least 15 minutes late 76 out of 81 times in the first quarter this year -- and was more than a half-hour late 56 times. In March, 81% of the departures on Piedmont Flight 14 from Charlotte, N.C., to New York's La Guardia Airport were more than 15 minutes late.    But what's causing the industry's delays? Clearly, mergers are playing a dramatic role. The performance of both Northwest, whose parent, NWA Inc., bought Republic, and for Texas Air Corp.'s Continental, which merged with People Express, New York Air and Frontier, fell 13 percentage points in March from the year-ago month. Those carriers acknowledge that combining their complex operations caused temporary delays.    Moreover, weather and an overburdened air-traffic control system accounted for many delays. Piedmont, for example, says air-traffic delays contribute to about half of its delays.    But seemingly small things play a big role too. Many travelers know that flights are more likely to be delayed in the winter and in certain crowded airports. But customer-service functions -- like ticket writing and boarding procedures -- are important too. Piedmont classifies many of these functions as &quot;station controllable,&quot; and says that category accounts for 20% to 25% of its delays.    &quot;These are things that we should be able to so something about,&quot; says Mr. Bethune.    The category also includes baggage transfers -- which American, in its filing, calls &quot;a major and contributing factor to delays&quot; at some airports. When travelers make connections, airlines have to transfer their luggage too. And that can sometimes take up to a half-hour, particularly at so-called hub airports where hundreds of flights connect each day.    &quot;People can walk off their plane and get on a connecting flight a lot faster than baggage crews can work,&quot; says Melvin Olsen, vice president of capacity planning for American.    Airlines also routinely hold the last flight of the day to a certain city for connecting passengers. That's so those passengers won't be stuck in a city all night. While the practice obviously benefits many flyers, it means that certain flights will always be prone to delays.    &quot;It's easier to tell people they have to wait two hours for the next flight, than to tell people they have to stay overnight,&quot; says a Piedmont spokesman.    Even the type of plane can affect delays. In March, USAir's 737-300 plane was on time for 58% of its arrivals, compared with 72% on the airline's DC9-30s. USAir officials say the 737 seats 28 more people, so passenger loading times are longer. They also say some aircrafts' baggage compartments are slightly better designed for faster loading and unloading.    But one of the most critical reasons for delays is simply the industry's scheduling practices. Critics charge that many carriers bunch flights at desirable times even when they know the airports can't handle them. The airlines deny this. But some carriers admit in the filings that they sometimes use in-air flight times that they can't meet on a consistent basis.    This happens, they say, because they are matching competitors' in-air times to stay competitive. Unless the matching stops, &quot;some flights will have a published schedule which is not accurate,&quot; says American in its filing.    The time airlines estimate for taxiing may also be inaccurate in some cases. In March, USAir blamed half of its delays on taxiing-related problems. Most taxiing-out delays are a result of air-traffic controllers holding up planes before takeoffs. And some taxiing-in delays are caused by congestion and bad weather. But USAir officials also concede that some timetables for taxiing need updating.    Aside from delays, the Department of Transportation filings also shed light on cancellations. Although airlines cancel only a small percentage of flights -- USAir's 494 cancellations, for instance, represented less than 2% of its total March flights -- those percentages add up to a lot of flights. On its Boston-Syracuse route, for example, Piedmont canceled 64 flights from last July through March.    The carriers say most cancellations are related to the weather. Still, several airline executives concede in interviews that when a plane on a heavily traveled route goes out of service, they may divert a plane with fewer passengers.    &quot;We try to disrupt the travel of the fewest number of people possible,&quot; says Mr. Olsen at American.    Meanwhile, airlines are starting to attack their delay problems. Piedmont says it is more willing to leave late-arriving passengers behind to stay on schedule. It is also forcing pilots to arrive one hour before the first flight each day; apparently some were oversleeping, officials say.    Following Piedmont's lead, American says that next month it will abandon the practice of matching the fastest flight time &quot;in favor of actual flight times&quot; system-wide.    These and other measures, airlines insist, are improving their performance. American says for a seven-day period ended May 11, 75% of its arrivals, and 89% of its departures were within 15 minutes. Although they wouldn't provide figures, Continental and Northwest say their ontime performance has significantly improved in April and May.    But critics say it's too early to tell if delays will improve for the long term. They also say -- and some airline officials concede -- that many of the industry's steps so far are only Band-Aid solutions and that both the industry and the air-traffic control systems need more dramatic changes.    &quot;Delays are still mounting,&quot; says Representative Nick Rahall, a West Virginia Democrat who introduced a bill that would require airlines to report their on-time performance records. &quot;It is going to get worse before it gets better.&quot;    ---                  How Airlines Stack Up   Percentage of on-time arrivals* for certain airlines.                         13-Month Average**    March 1987 Piedmont                70.2%                 77.4% Continental             67.4%                 56.9% USAir                   65.9%                 68.1% Eastern                 62.3%                 56.6% American                59.9%                 61.7% Northwest               55.3%***              50.5%   *Arrived within 15 minutes of schedule   **March 1986 through March 1987   ***Average excludes September and October 1986 databecause of merger with Republic   ---            Spotlight on USAir and Piedmont                 Reasons for USAir delays                      March 1987 Taxiing out before takeoff ........................ 26.2% Taxiing in after landing  ......................... 24.5% Inflight delays ................................... 19.2% Operational* ...................................... 11.5% Engine start and cockpit check ..................... 7.8% Customer services .................................. 7.1% Flight crew ........................................ 1.8% Gatehold ........................................... 1.1% Maintenance ........................................ 0.8% *Primarily from late arrival of aircraft                Reasons for USAir cancellations Weather ............................................. 49% Maintenance ......................................... 37% Other ............................................... 14%               Piedmont flights that arrived late                         March 1987 Flight #10, L.A. to Charlotte ....................... 65% Flight #20, Orlando to Dayton ....................... 61% Flight #14, Denver to Nashville ..................... 52% Flight #16, Norfolk to Newark ........................ 3%             Piedmont flights late leaving Boston               Jan. 1 - March 31, 1987 7 a.m. - 7:59 a.m. .................................. 11% 9 a.m. - 9:59 a.m. .................................. 28% 3 p.m. - 3:59 p.m. ..................................  7% 6 p.m. - 6:59 p.m. .................................. 30% 8 p.m. - 8:59 p.m. .................................. 33%         USAir late departures from these cities                       March 1987 Philadelphia ........................................ 35% Los Angeles ......................................... 33% Newark .............................................. 28% Pittsburgh .......................................... 27% Cleveland ........................................... 15%   NOTE: A delay indicates a flight departing more than 15minutes late   Source: Department of Transportation Filings and Carriers</TEXT></DOC>
