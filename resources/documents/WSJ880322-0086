As an investment, they aren't doing nearly so well.    So far in 1988, investors have plunked down more than $5 billion for such funds. That includes $2 billion alone in Massachusetts Financial Services Co.'s Intermediate Income Trust. And several huge closed-end bond fund offerings are expected to begin in the next few weeks.    Brokers like to cite plenty of pluses to these funds: usual yields of 10% or more, no commissions in the initial public offering, liquidity since the funds trade on major exchanges. And the funds issue a fixed number of shares-unlike mutual funds, which create shares on demand.    But many specialists warn investors against buying these funds when they are first offered. A major reason is that part of the initial offering price isn't invested at all, but goes to the fund's underwriters for helping bring it to market. This underwriting spread typically runs about 7%, meaning that only $930 of a $1,000 initial offering purchase actually is invested.    What's more, most of these funds, after briefly trading at a price above their net asset value, typically fall to a discount, reflecting lessened demand. Specialists say the premiums are even less likely to hold up as new funds proliferate.    &quot;It's just not a good deal,&quot; says Thomas J. Herzfeld, who runs a Miamibased investment management firm that bears his name. &quot;You're buying almost guaranteed underperformance.&quot;    The yields that investors receive can vary substantially, depending on the discount they pay from the net asset value. Take two closed-end funds-one old and one new-that each have $93 million in net assets, with 10 million shares outstanding, for a net asset value of $9.30. Assume they have the same quality portfolio and pay a $1 dividend. The new fund that an investor pays $10 for would reap a 10% yield, whereas the old fund trading at a 7% discount to its net asset value, or $8.65, offers a yield of 11.56%, Mr. Herzfeld notes.    Fund strategists suggest that holders who plan to invest for the long term wait to see how the portfolio shapes up. &quot;When you buy an initial public offering (in a closed-end fund), it's not quite a blind pool, but it comes as close to it as you can in the investment company world,&quot; says Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services Inc., which tracks funds.    Buying the funds does have some advantages, however, particularly if they've fallen to a discount. Peter Madlem, editor of the Closed End Fund Digest, a Santa Barbara, Calif., newsletter, recommended, for instance, buying the MFS Intermediate Income Trust with its 12% yield when it briefly traded below its offering price.    Most brokers defend the funds. They emphasize that closed-end fund managers can be fully invested at all times, unlike mutual fund managers who often need cash reserves to meet investor redemptions if the market moves against them. Brokers also contend that underwriters often support the initial share price by establishing short, or selling, positions that they later buy back. Despite the underwriting spreads, they say investors prefer not having to pay up-front sales fees.    What many brokers fail to note is that their own earnings are bigger from an initial closed-end fund offering. Fund specialists say brokers can make $200 on a typical $10,000 closed-end offering, compared with $75 for a similar fund already trading in the secondary market.    Closed-end bond funds have been the fastest growing segment of the mutual fund business since the stock market crashed in October, as investors have largely shied away from most stock funds. And several new closed-end bond offerings will be launched in the next few weeks-including Oppenheimer Management Corp.'s Multisector Income Trust, which will invest in seven sectors of the fixed-income market. Fund specialists say it is likely to bring in about $1.2 billion.    Perhaps the most adventuresome offering will come from Prudential-Bache Securities Inc. It soon plans to offer the High Yield Plus fund, which will invest in socalled bridge loans, the high-risk ventures typically used to finance leveraged buyouts and which can yield more than 13%. &quot;It's a more aggressive fund,&quot; says a Prudential-Bache broker. &quot;But if you're getting those kinds of yields, you've got to be willing to take some risk.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
