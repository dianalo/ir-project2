Closeout is based on the implementationof the required actions by licensees for all 25 General Electric (GE)facilities to which the bulletin was issued for action . The bulletinwas issued initially on November 20, 1979 and in slightly revised formon August 29, 1980. The NRC's concern was the safety impact of a lossof boron poison material from control blades on shutdown capability andscram reactivity. The failure mode had been identified and investigatedby GE. After examination of GE's hot cell test results, calculations,assumptions and conclusions, the NRC required all BWR licensees to takefive detailed actions, including submittal of written reports. On October22, 1985, the NRC granted GE's request that ``advanced longer-life controlrods'' (ALLCRs) be exempt from the requirements of the bulletin, exceptfor tracking control rod life.</TEXT></DOC>
