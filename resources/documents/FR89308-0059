Projects will be evaluated as to thelikelihood of achieving these benefits through both short-term and long-termresearch projects with consideration of the magnitude of the eventual benefitthat may be realized. Both short-term projects that may yield more immediatebenefits and long-term projects yielding greater benefits will receiveequal emphasis. Planning emphasis will be placed upon attaining each discretetarget benefit either through a single project or series of projects necessaryto attain that goal.Further information on current programs that address the above listed prioritiesmay be obtained from the NOAA National Marine Fisheries Service's SoutheastRegional Office.<ITAG tagnum="84">III.

Without such information, the merits of theproject may not be fully understood, or the value of the project to fisheriesuse may be underestimated. The absence of adequate supporting documentationmay cause reviewers to question assertions made in describing the projectand may result in a lower ranking of the project. Reviewers will not necessarilyexamine all material provided as supporting documentation except wheresufficient detail is lacking in the project description to properly evaluatethe project. Therefore, information presented in this section should beclearly referenced in the project description.5.

Review Process and Criteria</ITAG>1. Evaluation and Ranking of Proposed ProjectsFor applications meeting the requirements of this solicitation, NMFS willconduct a technical evaluation of each project prior to any other review.If an application contains two or more projects, NMFS will evaluate theprojects separately. All comments submitted to NMFS will be taken intoconsideration in the technical evaluation of projects. NMFS will providepoint scores on proposals based on the following evaluation criteria:(a) Adequacy of research/development/demonstration for managing or enhancingGulf of Mexico marine fishery resources, addressing especially the possibilitiesof securing productive results (30 points).(b) Soundness of design/technical approach for enhancing or managing theuse of Gulf of Mexico marine fishery resources (25 points).(c) Organization and management of the project, including qualificationsand previous related experience of the applicant's management team andother project personnel involved (20 points).(d) Effectiveness of proposed methods for monitoring and evaluating theproject (15 points).(e) Justification and allocation of the budget in terms of the work tobe performed (10 points).The average technical scores will be ranked by NMFS into three groups:(1) highly recommended, (2) recommended, and (3) not recommended, for presentationto MARFIN Board members. The Board members will consider the significanceof the problem addressed in the project, along with the technical evaluationand need for funding. This evaluation and ranking will enable NMFS to determinethe appropriate level of funding for each project.2. Consultation with OthersNMFS will make project descriptions available for review as follows:(a) Public review and comment.Applications may be inspected at the National Marine Fisheries ServiceRegional Office in St. Petersburg, Florida from April 24, 1989, to May1, 1989.(b) Consultation with members of the fishing industry. The NMFS shall,at its discretion, request comments from members of the fishing and associatedindustries who have knowledge in the subject matter of a project or whowould be affected by a project.(c) Consultation with government agencies. Applications will be reviewedin consultation with the NMFS Southeast Science and Research Director andappropriate laboratory personnel, CASC Grants Officer and, as appropriate,Department of Commerce bureaus and other federal agencies for eliminationof duplicate funding. The Regional Fishery Management Councils may be askedto review projects and advise of any real or potential conflicts with councilactivities.3. Funding DecisionAfter projects have been evaluated, MARFIN Board members will develop andsubmit funding recommendations to the Director of the NMFS Southeast RegionalOffice. The Director of the NMFS Southeast Regional Office will ascertainthat the projects do not substantially duplicate other projects that arecurrently funded by or are approved for funding by the U.S. Government,determine the projects to be funded, and determine the amount of fundsavailable for the program. The exact amount of funds awarded to each projectwill be determined in preaward negotiations between the applicant, NMFS,and the Grants Office. The Department of Commerce will review all recommendedprojects and funding before an award is executed by the Grants Officer.The funding instrument will be determined by the Grants Officer. Projectsmay not be initiated by a recipient until a notice of award is receivedfrom the Grants Officer. For multi-year projects, funds will be providedwhen specified tasks are satisfactorily completed and after NMFS has receivedMARFIN funds for subsequent fiscal years.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.
