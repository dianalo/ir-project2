Ferguson, chairman and chiefexecutive, &quot;we will benefit from our aggressivecost-reduction initiatives and continuing investments toupgrade the telecommunications infrastructure in theNortheast.&quot;   Nynex had about 83,900 employees as of Jan. 1, down nearly11% from a year ago. In November, the company said it plansto cut its management ranks by another 3,400 by the end of1993.
