The panel turned aside repeated efforts to amend the platformwith Jackson campaign planks as it approved a document of barely4,000 words _ one-tenth the size of its 1980 and 1984 platforms.   The decisive vote came on the first amendment, when the Jacksonforces sought to append their basic budget plan to the Democraticblueprint. The Jackson budget plank was rejected by a 108-44 marginand turned out to be the only issue decided by a standing tally.   Later, on voice votes, the Democrats rebuffed the Jackson forceson attempts to put a call for no-first-use of nuclear weapons inthe platform, and on a call for ``self-determination for Israelisand Palestinians.''   The committee did make some changes on issues ranging from childcare to the environment, but only when the Dukakis and Jacksoncampaigns were in accord.   Michigan Gov. James J. Blanchard, who chairs the platformcommittee, praised the final draft as ``a truly unique document.... I believe we're going to have a victorious year for allDemocrats.''   The meeting ended on a note of unity, with the delegatesunanimously adding even tougher language to their plank labelingSouth Africa a terrorist state. The final amendment says the nextadministration will ``determine a date certain by which U.S.corporations leave South Africa.''   Eleanor Holmes Norton, Jackson's representative on the platformcommittee, said, ``We feel we have achieved our goal to getJackson's views into the platform.'' She said she did not knowwhether Jackson would press any floor fights on the platform inAtlanta.   The meeting lasted 11 hours and, despite the rebuff to theJackson forces on key issues, remained harmonious throughout.   Mike Barnes, Dukakis' platform chief, said, ``It's a great signof unity. ... What was demonstrated here is that the Democraticparty really has matured and is ready to take the reins ofgovernment.''   Richard Hatcher, former mayor of Gary, Ind., offered the Jacksonamendment to freeze the military budget and ``return taxes on thevery richest Americans to their 1977 levels and restore corporatetaxes to their pre-Reagan levels.''   Hatcher said raising taxes on those making more than $200,000 ayear would raise $20 billion ``for investment in education, jobtraining and housing for homeless (and) other critical domesticneeds.''   But Rep. Robert Matsui of California, a Dukakis backer, replied,``I have never believed that the Democratic party's principle andgoals and values is to tax Americans. We have never said that waspart of our heritage.''   Matsui defended Dukakis's insistence that the government shouldstep up collection of taxes from scofflaws before looking to highertaxes to reduce the deficit.   On the Middle East, James Zogby, executive director of the ArabAmerican Institute, urged the party to seek ``peace based on mutualrecognition, territorial compromise and self-determination forIsraelis and Palestinians.''   Zogby said that while Democrats have a commitment to Israel,``Palestinians, too, need security. Palestinians want what anyother people want: the right to live in peace in their own land,free of occupation.''   But Sen. Bob Graham of Florida, speaking for the Dukakis side,said, ``We should not succumb to the temptation ... of wishing toimpose on other parties what we think the solution should be.''   On the no-first-use of nuclear weapons amendment, ClaireGreensfelder, a Jackson delegate and anti-nuclear activist fromBerkeley, Calif., was near tears as she argued, ``Let us rememberwe are the only people who have ever dropped a nuclear weapon onother people in the world.''   But the delegates rejected the amendment after hearing Rep. TomBevill of Alabama say, ``Certainly this would be weakening a strongdefense.''   The Platform Committee also rejected, by voice vote, an attemptto include in the platform the Jackson campaign's promise to doublethe federal education budget. The platform does promise to giveeducation ``our highest priority'' and to expand pre-schoolprograms and create a National Teacher Corps to recruit teachersthrough scholarships.   The 44 Jackson votes on the budget plank were nearly a quarterof the Platform Committee's full membership of 186, ensuringJackson's right to force a fight on the issue on the conventionfloor in Atlanta next month if he wishes.   Norton said Jackson told her by telephone from Puerto RicoFriday night that she should press the issues on which they wereunable to reach consensus ``in a spirit of collegiality and respectfor his opponent, Gov. Dukakis.''   She said Jackson wanted his delegates to remember ``that whatcounts is the final victory we shall achieve in November.''   Blanchard told the 153 members at the meeting, ``It's my hopethat our work will help elect Democrats from court houses to statehouses to the White House.''   Earlier, the governor told reporters, the document was shortenough to be put on posters and mailed out, ``read at theconvention and posted on the walls of government classes.''   The document, titled ``The Restoration of Competence and Hope,''pledges that Democrats will ``restore competence, caring andincorruptibility to the federal executive branch and get it workingagain fairly for all Americans.''   As Jackson wanted, it terms South Africa ``a terrorist state.''   Although it does not mention President Reagan or Vice PresidentGeorge Bush by name, it derides ``voodoo economics.''   It says Democrats will ``promote peace and prevent war'' but``not by trading weapons for hostages, not by sending braveAmericans to undefined missions in Lebanon and Honduras ... (and)not by toasting a tyrant like (former Philippine PresidentFerdinand) Marcos as a disciple of democracy.''   It promises the Democrats will seek ``significant reductions''in nuclear weapons. It urges ``more stable defense budgets'' and``maintaining the special relationship with Israel'' while pursuingpeace in the Middle East along lines of the Camp David accords.</TEXT></DOC>
