Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> CCI FRB </CO><IN> TNM BNK </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Citicorp is examining the books of troubled First RepublicBank Corp. with an eye toward proposing a federally assisted takeover of the troubled banking concern.    That's hopeful news in downtrodden Texas, but a rescue of the state's largest banking concern by the nation's largest banking company is far from a done deal. &quot;Yes, people are down there looking at it,&quot; a high-ranking Citicorp executive said yesterday, &quot;but we look at everything. Clearly, the feds aren't going to give this bank away. I give this a very slight chance of coming to anything.&quot;    Citicorp also has been examining several large Texas thrifts and could decide that acquiring one of them may give it a greater presence in the state at less cost -- and with far fewer headaches -- than First RepublicBank would.    Indeed, Albert V. Casey, First RepublicBank's chairman and chief executive officer, told employees in a private memo that he doubts a bid by Citicorp or any other company would prevail over a First RepublicBank recapitalization plan. It was in that memo yesterday that the Citicorp review was disclosed.    Nevertheless, nearly two dozen Citicorp officials yesterday began poring over First RepublicBank's multibillion-dollar portfolio of sour real estate loans, trying to assess the likelihood of a Southwest economic rebound and the cost of entering Texas via a bailout of First RepublicBank.    Any First RepublicBank acquisition is expected to involve the largest bank bailout in history, surpassing the $4.5 billion federal rescue of Continental Illinois Corp. four years ago. But it isn't clear how much capital Citicorp would be required to commit to an acquisition, if it proceeded.    First RepublicBank, with $28.4 billion in assets, is insolvent. It had $690 million in negative common equity at March 31 and has been resuscitated temporarily with emergency loans from the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. ranging from $2.5 billion to as much as $4 billion daily. First RepublicBank isn't related to San Francisco-based First Republic Bancorp.    Citicorp's study of First RepublicBank is the first concrete sign that any banking institution is interested in participating in a rescue of the deeply troubled bank. Until now, L. William Seidman, FDIC chairman, has said that the agency is talking to several interested parties, but he has declined to name them. It is understood, though, that some banks in the Southeast and West have considered making a bid. Robert M. Bass Group, the investment firm of the wealthy Fort Worth, Texas, investor, also considered a bid for First RepublicBank, but quickly backed off because of the banking concern's problem loans.    Banking experts have been generally skeptical that any institution would want to tackle First RepublicBank's considerable problems. Many have predicted the FDIC would take control of the institution, as it did in the Continental Illinois rescue. Citicorp also weighed a bid for Continental, as did several other New York banks, but backed away after a review of the Chicago-based banking company.    When Texas opened its borders to interstate bank takeovers in 1987, two major banking companies forged ahead: Chemical Banking Corp. purchased Texas Commerce Bancshares Inc. and First Interstate Bancorp acquired Allied Bancshares Inc., both of Houston. Neither transaction involved federal aid, but so far the acquisitions have been money losers.    Citibank, the banking arm of New York-based Citicorp, has been an aggressive issuer of commercial loans and residential mortgages in Texas. But it hasn't any major deposit-gathering abilities in the state. Citibank has examined several Texas banks, but thus far has decided that it didn't have enough confidence in the short-term Texas outlook to take the plunge.    It isn't clear whether its confidence level has risen enough to take on this Texas-sized headache. Citicorp's group arrived here just days before the FDIC's deadline this Thursday for takeover bids. And the hopeful news of the review, confirmed by the usually tight-lipped Texas company, came on the eve of today's shareholder meeting.    Citicorp's chairman and chief executive, John S. Reed, told a meeting of analysts in January that the company didn't plan any major acquisitions in 1988. &quot;We are clearly not in a big investment mode,&quot; he said. He added, however, that if a major institution were on the market, &quot;we'd look, you know us. But there's a discipline on our capital base. Buying for equity would be tough.&quot;    First RepublicBank, which was created a year ago by the merger of two large Dallas banking firms, became a ward of the government in March when it turned to Washington for a bailout after loan losses soared, a leading deposit-rating firm downgraded its deposit safety and a fierce depositor run took hold.    In the first quarter, First RepublicBank deposits shrank by $3.6 billion and it reported a $1.5 billion net loss, mostly due to bad real estate loans.    Since then, First RepublicBank and its investment banker, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., have put together a proposal to the FDIC to spin off a major part of its bad loans and recapitalize the company with FDIC funds and possibly new investors. If the FDIC accepts the plan, the company plans to register new securities in mid-August and hopes to complete the recapitalization by mid-December. The recapitalized company would likely be led by a new management team.    ---   Peter Truell and Robert Guenther in New York contributed to this article. </TEXT></DOC>
