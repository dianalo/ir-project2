The 1987 rate was 2.4 deaths per 100 million miles driven, down from 2.51 in 1986. The previous record low was 2.47 in 1985.    The actual number of deaths rose last year to 46,121 from 46,087 the year before. But the fatality rate dropped because the number of miles driven also increased -- to 1.91 trillion miles from 1.84 trillion in 1986.    &quot;Growing safety belt use and the national resolve to prevent drunken driving are enormously improving traffic safety for the American people,&quot; Transportation Secretary James Burnley said.    The traffic safety agency, an arm of the Transportation Department, estimated that more than 8,000 lives have been saved since 1983 because of seat belt use. It said that 40% of the traffic fatalities last year involved drunken driving, down from 46% in 1982. </TEXT></DOC>
