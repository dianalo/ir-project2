Background  </ITAG>This rule revises DFARS to provide increased flexibility to use sourcesother than the central supply system (DLA, GSA, and the Military Departments)when such action is judged to be in the best interest of the Government.This increased flexibility will implement DoD Directive 4001.1, which providesthat, with few exceptions, installation commanders should be allowed topurchase from sources offering the combination of quality, timeliness,and cost that best meets the requirement.  The revisions also implement key recommendations of the Packard Commissiondealing with the need to consider value instead of just price, and theneed to give greater authority to DoD acquisition personnel. In addition,the revisions include safeguards that will meet other important acquisitionsystem goals, such as the maintenance of an effective mobilization andwartime capability and proper file documentation so that prospective quality,timeliness, or cost deficiencies of the central supply system may be identifiedand corrected.  Publicizing is not required as the rule will not have a significant costor administrative impact on the public since it affects only the internaloperating procedures of the Department of Defense.  <ITAG tagnum="84">B.
