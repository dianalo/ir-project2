<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-44-0446 </DOCNO><TEXT>X-ray- and ultraviolet-photoelectron spectroscopic studies of the corelevels and the valence band of amorphous and crystalline (annealed at800 K) Ni/sub 81/Cr/sub 15/B{sub 4} metallic glass are presented, anda comparison has been made of the valence-band spectra with those ofthe constituent elements. The single broad band appearing in the vicinityof the Fermi level in the spectrum of amorphous Ni/sub 81/Cr/sub 15/B{sub4} is attributed to the d-band combination of both nickel and chromium.The low-lying states arise due to hybridization of metal-metalloid levels.The Ni{sub 3}B phase has been detected in crystalline Ni/sub 81/Cr/sub15/B{sub 4}. The binding energy changes in the Ni 2p/sub 3/2/, Cr 2p/sub3/2/, and B 1s levels, the variation of the Ni 2p/sub 3/2/ satelliteintensity, and asymmetry-index changes for the core lines have been usedto support the above picture as well as to arrive at a comprehensiveunderstanding of the density-of-states variation at the Fermi level.The charge-transfer mechanism between constituent elements in metallicglasses is also discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
