Hector Aguililla Saladrigas, who spent most of his 14-yeardiplomatic career involved in Middle East affairs, said he defectedlast fall after becoming disillusioned with Cuba's subversiveactivities and widespread official corruption.   Aguililla's defection was not publicly disclosed until the StateDepartment made him available for an interview Tuesday with TheAssociated Press.   He had been assigned to the Cuban Embassy in Madagascar but lastOct. 10, during a transit stop while en route to take up his dutiesthere, he asked U.S. officials for political asylum for himself, hiswife and two children, aged 13 and 10. He declined to say where therequest was made.   Much of his time since his defection has been spent in CIAdebriefings.   Aguililla, 35, offered a rare glimpse into the role Cuba hasplayed in cooperation with Palestinian radicals in the shadowyinternational arms trafficking business.   He said that with Palestinian help, Cuba arranged for thetransport of large quantities of Western-made weaponry to guerrillagroups in El Salvador, Guatemala and Chile and also providestraining of a ``terrorist nature'' to Palestinian militants.   Aguililla said that between 1980 and 1983 while he served as thesecond ranking official at the Cuban Embassy in Damascus, heroutinely made trips to Lebanon's Bekaa Valley where the trunk ofhis car was loaded with rifles, pistols, revolvers and smoke bombs.   He said Palestinian groups, particularly two pro-Marxistfactions, were the principal source of weaponry, which he was ableto transport back to Syria without a customs check because of thediplomatic plates on his car.   On occasion, he said, a top Cuban intelligence officer flew toDamascus for larger-scale arms transfers.   Weapons of U.S., Israeli or Italian manufacture were favoredbecause ``socialist involvement'' in the arms trafficking schemecould thus be concealed, he said.   ``The Palestinians were a good source of Western arms becausethey had a lot of contacts to get them,'' he added.   ``The policy of Cuba has always been to export the revolution,''Aguililla said as he recounted his experiences in the 75-minuteinterview. He referred on occasion to a single page of typewrittennotes he used as a memory aid.   Speaking in Spanish while chain-smoking cigarettes, Aguilillasaid he does not know if the arms smuggling operation by way ofSyria continued beyond 1983 because he left the country in early1984. Since then he served brief stints at the Cuban embassies inIran and Kuwait.   Aguililla said he was troubled by evidence of widespread officialcorruption in Cuba, a problem that has been acknowledged byPresident Fidel Castro.   But Castro nonetheless contends that the revolution has producedhundreds of thousands of selfless individuals who volunteer forsocial welfare projects at home and in numerous Third Worldcountries.   The Cuban diplomatic mission here was apprised of Aguililla'sallegations on Wednesday but spokesman Angel Pino refused comment.   According to Aguililla, Wilma Espin, a member of the Politburoand head of the Federation of Cuban Women, once helped herselfduring a visit to Damascus to a fund that embassy women hadcontributed to for parties and toys for children and used the moneyfor shopping.   Orlando Fundora, formerly the chief ideologue of the revolution,stopped once in Damascus, Aguililla said, and asked him to exchangemoney on the black market.   ``He was supposed to be the model of socialist morality butnonetheless he violated the law of that country,'' Aguililla added.   As a cost-cutting measure, the Cuban Foreign Ministry sentdollars in cash to the embassy in Tehran with the understanding thatthe currency would be exchanged on the black market at windfallprofit rates.   An enterprising group of Cuban diplomats in Peru shipped frozenbeef via the diplomatic pouch to co-conspirators at the ForeignMinistry in Havana, Aguililla said, adding that the beef was thensold privately at a hefty profit.</TEXT></DOC>
