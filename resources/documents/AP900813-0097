KNUTSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Mideast is bristling with billions ofdollars worth of modern weapons, much of the arsenal provided bythe United States. That includes Kuwaiti missiles now in the handsof Iraq.   Many of the arms transfers to the Mideast have been financed bylow-interest, long-term U.S. loans. Israel, at nearly $1.9 billionthis year, and Egypt, at almost $1.3 billion, are the world'sbiggest recipients of such aid.   Other nations, such as Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, pay cash forU.S. weapons.   Both the aid program and the cash sales are aimed at supportingfriendly governments in the region and assuring the free flow ofoil.   That overriding interest caused President Bush to dispatch U.S.military forces to the Persian Gulf last week to shield oil-richSaudi Arabia from the threat of an attack by Iraq, which overranKuwait Aug. 2.   Pentagon officials say that while the United States sold arms toKuwait only infrequently, its arsenals included some U.S. Hawkanti-aircraft missiles and several thousand U.S. Tow anti-tankmissiles. All are now believed to be in Iraqi hands.   Most of Kuwait's fighter aircraft, including two squadrons ofFrench-built Mirage F-1s and several dozen American Skyhawkwarplanes, are believed to have been flown to safety in SaudiArabia.   Before it was attacked, Kuwait had arranged a $1.8 billionpurchase of U.S. FA-18 fighter aircraft plus anti-ship andanti-aircraft missiles.   But the aircraft were not scheduled for delivery until 1992 anda Pentagon official, who asked not to be named, said that if Kuwaitremains in Iraq's control the United States has no obligation todeliver them.   Over the last 20 years, just $1.5 billion in U.S. weaponry wastransferred to Kuwait, a small fraction of the arms sent to otherMideastern nations.   Saudi Arabia has been the biggest customer for U.S. arms, with$23 billion in deliveries over that period. Israel has received $11billion in weapons; Egypt, $6 billion.   Washington has sold Saudi Arabia much of its modern weaponry andis helping that nation modernize its military capability.   Shortly after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the United Statesacted to dismantle congressional obstacles to arms deliveries toSaudi Arabia.   Defense Secretary Richard Cheney waived a legislativerestriction limiting to 60 the number of sophisticated F-15warplanes Saudi Arabia is allowed to have. The Pentagon officialsaid the Saudis will now be allowed to have 70 F-15s.   The Saudis previously made a $3 billion purchase of U.S. TOWanti-tank missiles, which are now being produced, the officialsaid. Last year, the Saudis bought 320 M1A2 tanks, which have yetto be built, for $3 billion.   Major Saudi arms deals this year include more than $1 billionfor the modernization of the oil-rich kingdom's national guard andanother $1 billion to modernize the Saudi fleet of AWACSearly-warning aircraft.   In Israel, the United States is trying to improve that nation'sdefensive capability through a naval modernization program, whichincludes the construction of submarines, the Pentagon official said.   Israel is also developing and recently tested the Arrow defensemissile, which is designed to destroy incoming missiles. Eightypercent of the cost of the program is being borne by the UnitedStates.   Egypt has become a major recipient of U.S. military aid since itbecame the first Arab nation to recognize Israel in 1979. Egypt isnow buying Harpoon anti-ship missiles.   More modest U.S. aid, mostly in the form of military trainingand basic gear, is provided to Jordan _ $47.8 million this fiscalyear _ and to other countries in the Middle East.   For the next fiscal year, the Bush administration has askedCongress for permission to make $4.3 million in arms-sales loansfor U.S. allies in the Mideast.</TEXT></DOC>
