(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Hundreds of wildcat strikers caused trafficjams to slow coal shipments Tuesday, and three union leaders werereleased from a two-week jail stay brought about by strike activityagainst mines in Virginia.   ``Together, we can win this strike,'' said Marty Hudson, thefield commander of the United Mine Workers-authorized strike by1,900 Pittston Coal Group Inc. employees in Virginia, West Virginiaand Kentucky.   A federal judge's June 5 decision to hold the three in jailwithout bond until they promised an end to the civil disobedienceagainst Pittston has been a rallying point for the wildcat strikes.   Those strikes, work stoppages not officially authorized by theUMW, have idled about 28,000 miners in nine states.   Hundreds of the wildcat strikers converged on the southwestVirginia coalfields and took part Tuesday in traffic jams designedto slow Pittston's coal shipments.   ``They've just got the place saturated with people; it's prettywell blocked up,'' said state police Lt. C.F. Eaton.   Hudson said the wildcat strikers realize that if Pittston issuccessful in breaking away from a national contract and weakeningjob security and benefits, other companies may follow suit.   ``They see what Pittston is doing as a threat to their unions,''Hudson said. ``If Pittston is successful, it will directly affecttheir lives.''   Hudson, Jackie Stump, president of the UMW's southwest Virginiadistrict, and C.A. Phillips, a UMW international representative,were jailed after U.S. District Judge Glen Williams found themguilty of contempt of court.   Williams said the three violated his order banning sit-downdemonstrations to block coal trucks at Pittston's processing plants.   They were freed by Williams after promising during a privatehearing here Tuesday to abide by his order.   The three said they purged themselves of the contempt chargebecause striking miners and supporters told them their leadershipwas needed and their testimony was needed by demonstrators arrestedin sit-down protests.   ``This strike is still building,'' Hudson told the crowd. He toldreporters the decision to promise to comply with strike restrictionsin order to get out of jail was not a surrender.   ``There are no white flags in these hands. We're going to winthis strike. We're not turning back,'' Hudson said before holding upa bandanna printed in camouflage, the symbol of the striking miners.   Chuck Donnelly, an attorney for the UMW in West Virginia, saidthe release of the three should bring an end to the wildcat walkouts.   ``It sounds like a cause for celebration,'' Donnelly said.   But Roger Caldwell, a field representative in the UMW's District17, said the unauthorized strikes probably will continue as minersturn attention to the $3 million in fines levied against the UMW bya circuit court judge in Lebanon, Va.   Caldwell was proven correct when about 350 workers at two Indianamines ignored a federal judge's order to end their wildcat strike,and 350 United Mine Workers in Missouri refused to go back to workand walked out of a meeting with union officials.   The nearly 1,700 UMW employees walked off their Pittston jobs inVirginia and West Virginia on April 5 after working more than 14months without a contract. The strike spread to Pittston's Kentuckyoperations Monday, idling another 200 UMW members.   The unauthorized walkouts began last week after a UMW rally inCharleston to protest Pittston's failure to sign a nationwidecontract and to protest the fines and jail terms assessed unionmembers in Virginia.</TEXT></DOC>
