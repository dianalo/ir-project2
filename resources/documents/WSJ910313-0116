President Bush has placed the hostage problem on Secretaryof State Baker's agenda when he meets with Middle Eastleaders. As Terry Anderson's representative in Congress, Ijoin with the families of the hostages in finding new andstrengthened hope in this initiative.</LP><TEXT>   For six years, Mr. Anderson has remained chained to awall. Year after long year, I have made statements on theHouse floor marking his birthday and date of kidnappingurging action to seek his release. Last spring, as Mr.Anderson began his sixth year in captivity, I introduced acongressional resolution calling for the appointment of aspecial envoy to secure freedom for the hostages. I wasunable to pass it because the administration was opposed totalking with terrorists -- now, at last, we consider thelives of the hostages worth talking about. Secretary Bakermust not give up until Terry and his fellow hostages arefree.   Rep. Louise M. Slaughter (D., N.Y.)   Washington</TEXT></DOC>
