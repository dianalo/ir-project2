About 2,000 radical students supporting the Rev. Moon Ik-hwanbattled riot police with firebombs and rocks at five collegecampuses in the capital today for a second day. Police said therewere some injuries and arrests but had no figures.   About 10,000 veterans and supporters staged a mostly peacefulmarch to the presidential mansion to call for the punishment ofMoon, who was arrested Thursday after returning from communistNorth Korea. The protesters demanded dissident groups be disbandedand their members jailed.   Protesters chanted ``Destroy communists!'' and ``Execute theMoon Ik-hwan clique!'' before riot police turned them away severalblocks from the mansion. Some marchers, including a few inwheelchairs, attempted to force their way past police but werestopped.   At a rally before the march, cheering veterans burned largeeffigies of Moon embracing North Korean leader Kim Il Sung. Someenraged veterans cut their fingers and drew anti-communist sloganswith their blood as the crowd cheered.   Many of the protesters were elderly veterans of the Korean Warthat ended in 1953, but younger veterans from the Vietnam War alsotook part. South Korea sent troops to Vietnam to support the UnitedStates and South Vietnam.   Police earlier arrested about 60 members of right-wing youthgroups who briefly occupied the Seoul offices of the country's maindissident movement, the United National Democratic Movement, toprotest Moon's visit to the north.   Student leaders demanded the release of Moon and other jaileddissident leaders and called for the overthrow of President RohTae-woo. The student protests today were smaller than violentclashes Thursday involving at least 10,000 students in five cities.   North Korea today condemned Moon's arrest and said itconstituted ``a vicious challenge to human rights, democracy andthe peaceful reunification of the nation.'' The government'sstatement was carried by the Korean Central News Agency andmonitored in Tokyo.   Despite the controversy over Moon, South Korean officials saidtoday they will attend an inter-Korea sports meeting Tuesday in theborder town of Panmunjom. National Unification Minister LeeHong-koo said the meeting, the third since March 9, is aimed atforming a single delegation to the 1990 Asian Games in Beijing,China.   Moon created a major political controversy in the South bymaking a secret visit to North Korea last month to meet withcommunist leader Kim to discuss ways to reunite the Koreanpeninsula.   Moon and a companion were arrested Thursday after landing inSeoul. The 71-year-old dissident was charged with being a NorthKorean agent _ a charge that could carry the death penalty if he isfound guilty.   Police today arrested Im Jae-kyung, vice president of theopposition Hankyoreh newspaper, for trying to arrange a trip toNorth Korea to interview Kim, officials said. Police earlierarrested one of the paper's editorial writers who wanted to visitthe north to meet Kim, police said.   The two Koreas have been bitter rivals since the division of thepeninsula at the end of the Second World War. North Korea invadedthe south in 1950 at the start of the bloody Korean War, whichended in 1953.</TEXT></DOC>
