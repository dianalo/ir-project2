Traders say the trend is adding depth and breadth to the New York market, where more than 100 non-U.S. banks already trade foreign exchange. But it also increases competition among the banks for experienced currency traders -- and for customers.    A New York-based trading desk has been a feature of most leading overseas banks since the 1970s. The latest entrants are generally smaller banks or banks from smaller countries. Credito Italiano and Tokai Bank aren't household names in the U.S., for example. But they are two of the new participants in the U.S. foreign exchange market, where trading averages $60 billion a day.    &quot;There's a continued influx of overseas banks coming into New York,&quot; David Palmer, president of Forex USA Inc., an association of currency traders, says. Recently joining the list of foreign players were Austria's Girozentrale Vienna and Belgium's Banque Bruxelles Lambert.    Richard W. Magee, managing director of Tullett andamp; Tokyo Forex Inc., a currency broker, said that in the past year, the company has installed trading lines to about a dozen new branches of foreign banks, mostly from smaller countries.    &quot;Every bank would like to be in New York,&quot; he says.    Another force behind the trend is the round-the-clock nature of foreign exchange trading and the need for banks to guard their market positions as trading continues around the world each day.    &quot;If you're in the trading world, you have to be in Tokyo, London and New York,&quot; Mr. Magee says.    Interbank rivalry also may be driving some of the medium-sized concerns. &quot;There's an element of keeping up with the Joneses,&quot; Mr. Palmer says.    For example, Girozentrale Vienna's Manhattan opening came at nearly the same time as the New York market debut of Oesterreichische Laenderbank AG, a fellow Austrian competitor. Market sources say Oesterreichische Laenderbank moved its operations into New York's General Motors Building very recently and has participated in the interbank market here. But a New York telephone operator couldn't find a listing Friday for the Austrian bank.    In addition to trading major currencies, many of these banks are expanding the U.S. market for some minor currencies. Girozentrale, for example, does about $100 million a day of business here in trading the dollar and the West German mark, Edward J. Hafner, chief dealer, says. But its trading in the Austrian schilling generates between $10 million and $25 million in additional daily volume.    &quot;Being an Austrian, I didn't expect so much (schilling) business here,&quot; Mr. Hafner says. &quot;But Citibank, Morgan, Irving, all of them come to us to make their schilling business.&quot;    The Citibanks, Morgans and Irvings also indirectly help staff foreign banks. Joseph J. Spendley, vice president and head of foreign exchange at Girozentrale in New York, is a veteran of Irving Trust Co.'s foreign exchange department and joined the Austrian concern after a stint in the branch office of a Portuguese bank. Former Citibank and Bankers Trust Co. dealers also staff the Austrian bank's New York operation.    The competition for talent also intensifies the fight for customers. Since being wooed from Bank of America to run Banque Bruxelles Lambert's New York treasury services, Viraf Reporter has courted his former Bank of America clients.    &quot;In this business, many activities center around personal relationships as much as banking relationships,&quot; he says. &quot;I intend to go after those relationships.&quot;    It remains an uphill battle for smaller foreign banks in New York, though, who lack such intangibles as name recognition. As Mr. Reporter of Banque Bruxelles Lambert says: &quot;It's easy to market as BOA (Bank of America). It isn't easy to market as BBL.&quot;    Bank Bumi Daya, a Jakarta, Indonesia-based bank, has found a niche for its New York currency trading operation by serving the needs of companies doing trade with Indonesia, and selectively playing in the foreign exchange market on the bank's own account. &quot;We don't trade in all of the currencies all of the time, just when we see we can make a profit,&quot; Riccardo R. Lawalata, the branch general manager, says.    After nearly two years in New York, Bank Bumi Daya has done only one transaction in its native Indonesian currency, and that was a year ago.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar ended higher against most other major currencies in a market thinned by weekend and month-end position-squaring. Traders described the rise mainly as a technical rebound from Thursday's fall.    In late New York trading, the U.S. currency was quoted at 1.8605 West German marks, up from 1.8550 marks late Thursday, and at 150.13 Japanese yen, compared with 149.51.    Several traders said activity was particularly anemic. &quot;Fridays in the summer are normally very thin. Coupled with the last trading day (of the month), it was virtually a standstill,&quot; Peter Rogers, vice president and treasurer in New York for Italy's Banca Nazionale dell'Agricultura, said. Traders generally use the end of the month to square their positions as they calculate the month's results.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose $1.90 an ounce to $464.10 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was four million ounces.    The dollar was quoted at 150.70 yen in early Tokyo trading Monday.    Gold was quoted at $447.75 an ounce in early trading today in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, July 31, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
