HudsonStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 10/26/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> NYN BLS BEL AIT USW PAC SBC FORGN TTELECOMMUNICATIONS, BROADCASTING, TELEPHONE, TELEGRAPH (TEL) </IN><TEXT>   Baby Bells, the seven regional U.S. phone concerns spun off from American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co., have begun a push for international business in the face of powerful forces that could stunt their growth world-wide.    They already have chalked up a few small successes lately, including New York-based Nynex Corp.'s purchase of a computer-software business in Britain and BellSouth Corp.'s acquisition of a telephone answering-machine service in Australia. Just yesterday, BellSouth reached an accord with Telediffusion de France to handle customer billing and other services for the French television company's radio-paging network, due to open next month.    Despite such isolated successes, the Baby Bells aren't juggernauts bound for world dominance. They do enjoy financial might that matches their grand ambitions: Each Baby Bell is the size of Europe's biggest national phone companies. But industry analysts say the companies face tough competition and complex politics abroad, and their international forays aren't stirring the same fears among foreign competitiors that ATandamp;T's overseas launch did three years ago.    &quot;There is a terrible naivete in these Baby Bells,&quot; says Edward Mier, a European telecommunications analyst for San Jose, Calif.-based Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm. &quot;They don't realize how regulated these (foreign) markets are.&quot;    More importantly, the U.S. government restricts what businesses the regional phone companies can pursue overseas. The restrictions, such as a ban on offering long-distance services between the U.S. and other countries, aim to keep the U.S. phone market competitive and local phone service of high quality.    Jonathan Solomon, strategic director of Britain's Cable andamp; Wireless PLC, a partner in foreign ventures with Nynex and San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group, another Baby Bell, believes U.S. authorities may hinder any Baby Bell international efforts that could divert resources from local phone service. He calls this an &quot;albatross&quot; around the neck of the companies.    Such talk doesn't bother Baby Bells much. Nynex Chairman Delbert Staley agrees government restraints currently &quot;would be the biggest drawback.&quot; But he doesn't view that &quot;as a long-term problem. I expect we'll get greater and greater freedom to do what we want to do&quot; from the U.S. court overseeing the 1984 ATandamp;T break-up decree. In time, Mr. Staley believes foreign businesses will be a significant profit source for Nynex.    This year, the Baby Bells' combined international revenues probably won't exceed $300 million -- a mere tidbit compared with their total revenues last year of $60.2 billion. Among the Baby Bells, BellSouth and Nynex have the biggest foreign businesses and ambitions.    &quot;We recognize we're the new kids on the block,&quot; handicapped initially by a lack of international savvy, says Roger Hale, chairman of BellSouth International Inc. Despite BellSouth's high hopes, he adds, &quot;you'd have to be an unbelievable fool to think that a company like (a Baby Bell) can just leap offshore in a highly competitive environment and blow them (foreign rivals) out of the water.&quot;    The Baby Bells, though, have a lot more riding on their sorties abroad than a few extra marks, yen or pounds. Most of them view an international base as critical to retaining their most important domestic customers: multinational concerns constantly prowling for better and cheaper international communications services.    Thus, Nynex last week announced an agreement with the Dutch telecommunications authority that partly will study ways to improve services to multinationals with Dutch operations. Nynex previously reached a similar pact with France's phone authority.    Baby Bells also are using the world as a schoolroom to learn how to run businesses they can't engage in now at home. For instance, St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell Corp. recently acquired a 50% stake in a small Israeli electronic-publishing company, in part to gain experience in that field for eventual use in the U.S., says Richard Dietz, Southwestern Bell's head of strategic planning.    Worried about the competitive threat, ATandamp;T also is trying to trip its offspring Bells at the starting gate. ATandamp;T is arguing in U.S. federal court, for instance, against plans by Nynex to operate transatlantic communications cable with Cable andamp; Wireless. A Nynex victory would prompt other Bells to mount similar ventures; a ruling is expected early next year.    Meanwhile, the regional companies are restricting most of their international plans to ventures they can enter legally. Southwestern Bell says it intends to start marketing telephones in Britain next year. In five years, BellSouth's Mr. Hale hopes to more than triple annual revenues from international mobile-communications services to about $350 million from the less than $100 million projected for 1987.    International expansion &quot;is a long-term commitment,&quot; he says. &quot;And our destiny is to be global,&quot; he says. </TEXT></DOC>
