Last month, he bluntly told delegatesto the union's convention it was time to &quot;talk honestly&quot;about the abysmal state of public education.   &quot;How bad are things?&quot; he asked his fellow teachers.&quot;Ninety-five percent of the kids who go to college in theU.S. would not be admitted to college anywhere else in theworld.&quot; If any teachers doubted this, Mr. Shanker asked themto test their own 17-year-olds by having them explain anewspaper editorial, write something or do a two-part mathproblem. &quot;Do it for yourself so you get a good picture ofwhere you are,&quot; he said. &quot;You won't be moved to change unlessyou believe things are really bad.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Shanker admitted teachers needed &quot;to come up with somekind of system we can put into our public schools to showthat something bad will happen if we don't do a good job, andsomething good will happen if we do.&quot; But then he repeatedhis opposition to the one device that would fostercompetition in education -- choice. He called instead for&quot;restructuring&quot; the public schools.   It is perhaps too much to expect Mr. Shanker to endorsevouchers or tax-credit plans that may disrupt the jobsecurity of his members, but parents have looked at what the30% increase in real spending on education since 1981 hasbought them and increasingly are deciding that choice, notmore money, is the answer.   It seems there is growing support among everyone exceptpublic-school careerists for the idea of choice. So it's nowimportant to start sorting out choice plans that can workfrom those that paper over the problem.   One rule of thumb in assessing the potential value of achoice plan is, how loudly do the defenders of the status quo-- union leaders and bureaucrats -- condemm it? On thatbasis, Wisconsin state legislator Polly Williams takes thehonors. Next month her voucher plan will pay up to $2,500each to allow hundreds of poor Milwaukee students to attendprivate nonsectarian schools.   Herbert Grover, Wisconsin's Schools Superintendent, haswaged a legal war against the Williams plan. This month, heaccused Mrs. Williams of being &quot;used&quot; by business interestswho want to privatize education.   Mrs. Williams says it is rather the Milwaukeepublic-school bureaucracy that has &quot;used&quot; her constituents'money to build an educational empire that fails to teachbasic skills. Busloads of black parents recently went to thestate capital in Madison to show Mr. Grover who reallysupports Polly Williams. A court has declared the voucherplan constitutional, and on Monday a higher court denied arequest for an injunction against it.   The situation is different in Detroit. There, voterselected a new school board in 1988 that promised educationalchoice. But board members have tired of hand-to-hand combatwith the resisting unions, and have shelved real choice infavor of allowing parent-teacher committees some say overlocal school policy. The Detroit News reports that even thisplan has met with such opposition from principals that onlysix out of some 250 schools are involved. Black parentsgrumble they may have to elect a new board to secure realchange.   Somewhere between Milwaukee's boldness and Detroit'spassivity is New York state, which has proposed a series ofconventional reforms to make schools more accountable toparents. But buried among them is a bold proposal &quot;to rewardschools for success and mete out consequences for failure.&quot;Schools that failed to meet standards would be&quot;de-registered&quot; and closed. Their students would then beallowed to use vouchers to attend other public or nonpublicschools.   Teacher unions fiercely oppose this idea, calling it abackdoor effort to undermine the public schools. But StateEducation Commissioner Thomas Sobol says public schoolsshould be forced to compete if they cannot perform at aminimal level.   Opponents of both the New York plan and Mrs. Williams saychoice is favored by elitists and the rich, ignoring pollsthat show blacks and the poor favor it more than the middleclass, whose schools often still work. Both sides will bekeenly watching the November elections in liberal Oregon,where an educational-choice initiative is on the ballot. Itwould allow students to attend public schools outside theirarea and provide tax credits for those wishing to go toprivate schools. Poor people who paid no state income taxwould get a voucher of up to $2,500 a year to allow them toparticipate.   Educational choice is the key to solving the problems thatMr. Shanker and other educators now admit exist. It wouldinject real opportunity into America's depressed innercities. That's why the most fervent proponents of genuinechoice today are poor and minority parents who seecompetition as the only way to secure a quality education fortheir kids.</TEXT></DOC>
