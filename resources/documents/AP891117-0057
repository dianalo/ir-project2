The official commented Thursday at a news conference on a billmaking its way through the Soviet legislature. It would lift mostof the travel restrictions that Soviet citizens and internationalleaders have complained about for decades.   Soviet officials argued that the more liberal law wouldencourage Soviets to stay home instead of fleeing their country asEast Germans have done.   ``There will be no need to be reckless and go for permanentresidence abroad. First you should go and see,'' said Rudolf A.Kuznetsov, the head of the Soviet agency that issues visas.   ``The more democratic and liberal the exit rules, the lesspeople want to leave, and this is corroborated by the recentexample of the German Democratic Republic,'' said Anatoly G.Kovalev, a first deputy foreign minister.   He was referring to the Nov. 9 decision by East Germany'sCommunist leaders, under the pressure of street protests and massemigration through socialist countries, to open borders to freetravel and begin reforms.   Most East Germans who crossed into West Berlin, West Germany,through openings in the Berlin Wall returned after a brief visit.   Kuznetsov said 5 million to 6 million of the 287 million Sovietsare expected to emigrate or travel abroad next year. He gave nobreakdown.   Legislator Fyodor Burlatsky said on Monday that he expects500,000 to emigrate next year.   By comparison, Kuznetsov said that by the end of this year,200,000 people are expected to emigrate and 2 million to travelabroad.   U.S. Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher said in Washington theeasing of Soviet emigration laws would open the Soviet Union formost-favored-nation trade status with the United States.   In the past, tens of thousands of Jews and other Soviets wererefused exit visas, a policy the West repeatedly censured.   The Soviet legislation would allow emigration for virtuallyanyone who has entry permission from another country and nooutstanding alimony obligations, criminal charges or recentknowledge of state secrets.   It would set a limit of five years on the period a citizen canbe kept from emigrating because of access to secrets.   Kovalev and other officials promised that emigration and foreigntravel would be barred in only very limited cases. But in anapparent reference to the exodus from East Germany, he added thatthe Kremlin was not in favor of a mass flight to the West.   ``The Soviet state, as any other, is not interested instimulating the exodus of its people to foreign countries,'' hesaid. ``The brain drain of talent did not strengthen any state.''   Many of the fleeing East Germans are young and skilled.   Kovalev bristled at a reporter's suggestion that Soviets, likemany East Germans, might become fed up with domestic economictroubles and choose to leave. ``Each has his own reasons, and thesituation in the German Democratic Republic is quite different,''he said.   The officials cited several factors that might limit emigration:the heavy workload of visa officials, immigration restrictionsimposed by other countries, the difficulty of obtaining planetickets to fly out of the Soviet Union and limits on the amount ofmoney Soviets can convert into foreign currency.</TEXT></DOC>
