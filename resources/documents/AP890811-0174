The unanimous ruling cannot be appealed.   The court ruled that the 40, who included a former air forcecommander, were covered by an amnesty law issued by the militarygovernment.   The opposition, which is favored in polls to win the Dec. 14presidential election, has promised to repeal the 1978 law.   It says it will investigate the human rights violations occurredsince military president Augusto Pinochet seized power in a bloody1973 coup, and bring those responsible for them to trial.   Military leaders, however, have warned that repealing the lawwould have ``unpredictable consequences.''   The amnesty law covers crimes, including human rights abuses,that occurred from Sept. 11, 1973, when elected President SalvadorAllende was overthrown, to March 11, 1978.   Among the defendants were retired air force Gen. Gustavo Leigh,a former member of the four-men military junta led by Pinochet thattook power after the coup. Leigh retired in 1978.   Also covered by the amnesty were two other air force generalsand a national police general, all retired.   After seizing power, the military jailed thousands of membersand supporters of the toppled leftist government. Some weretortured and killed, and thousands were forced into exile.   The Roman Catholic Church and human rights groups here andabroad have documented the cases of more than 700 disidents whodisappeared after being arrested by security agents.   The group granted definite amnesty today had been indicted by acivilian judge, Carlos Cerda, in the cases of 10 members of theCommunist Party members who disappeared after being arrested in1976.   After Judge Cerda filed the charges, however, the SantiagoAppeals Court ordered him to stop the proceedings and apply theamnesty law in the case.   Cerda refused, but the Appeals Court suspended him from his jobfor two months, applying the amnesty law. That suspension also wasupheld Friday by the Supreme Court.</TEXT></DOC>
