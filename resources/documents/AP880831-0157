Dukakis also attacked the Reagan-Bush environmental record a daybefore Bush was to venture behind enemy lines for a Boston Harbortour designed to showcase Massachusetts' greatest environmentalembarrassment.   Bush has criticized Dukakis for not moving earlier to clean upthe harbor, the nation's filthiest, but the Massachusetts governorsaid he was not to blame and that Reagan's Environmental ProtectionAgency had contributed to the delay in getting the project started.   Dukakis scoffed at Bush's pledge Wednesday to combat acid rainwith a new program.   ``Talk about an election year convert,'' Dukakis said. He notedmoney cut from federal environmental cleanup programs and said,``He wants to spend it on Star Wars,' the space defense proposal.   The Democratic nominee, meeting with reporters before flying toCalifornia to begin a three-day campaign trip, blasted theadministration for cutting funding for the Clean Water Act, some ofwhich could have been used for the harbor cleanup, and for notacting promptly on the state's request for a waiver to federalsewage treatment guidelines. When the waiver request was rejected,Dukakis began the multi-billion dollar cleanup.   ``We are doing it, no thanks to Mr. Bush or theadministration,'' Dukakis said.   Dukakis campaign aides told a morning strategy briefing thatDukakis would make questions about Bush's judgment a central themeof his campaign.   To that end, Dukakis used the meeting with reporters to denounceBush's role in the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran for the secondconsecutive day.   ``He refused to explain his role in this, one of the greatestforeign policy mistakes in history,'' Dukakis said. ``The vicepresident supported the decision ... The American people would liketo know the answer to a continuing question: Mr. Bush, you satthrough five meetings, five meetings on the subject. How can yousay now that you did not know that know that it was a straightarms-for-hostages deal.''   Joining Dukakis at the news conference was Maine Sen. GeorgeMitchell, the co-author of a new book on the Iran-Contra affair,``Men of Zeal,'' and a member of the congressional committee thatinvestigated the arms deal.   Mitchell said the hearing records and Bush's public statementsshowed that the vice president endorsed the trading of weapons forAmerican hostages held by pro-Iranian factions.   The Democratic senator, who later attended a separate newsconference to denounce the Reagan administration environmentalrecord, said it was ludicrous for Bush to come to Boston to discusswater pollution and also attacked the vice president's statement onacid rain.   Mitchell, the prime sponsor of legislation to control emissionsblamed for acid rain, said the Reagan administration hasconsistently opposed the measure.   ``Where has Vice President Bush been for the past sevenyears?,'' Mitchell said. ``The Reagan-Bush administration hasopposed every single effort to deal with acid rain. ... For anyAmerican concerned with the environment, the choice in thiselection is very clear.''   Bush may not be alone on the harbor when he takes his pollutiontour Thursday. Dukakis aides and allies said they were consideringa harbor event of their own to answer the expected Bush attacks onDukakis' handling of the harbor project.</TEXT></DOC>
