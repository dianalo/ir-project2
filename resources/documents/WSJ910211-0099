Culminating an 18-month process, the administration hasresolved sticking points on some minor issues and plans torelease the plan as early as next week. Under the latestrevisions, manufacturers would be required to list the energyefficiency of light bulbs on labels rather than require thatall bulbs meet strict federal standards.</LP><TEXT>   The administration shied away from proposals to reverse aruling that treats rebates from utilities as taxable income.In addition, it decided against setting up a self-financedrevolving fund for energy efficiency projects at federalagencies and replacing the tax credit for investment inalternative energy projects with a production credit.   Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, appearingyesterday on NBC-TV's &quot;Meet The Press,&quot; said he stronglydisagrees with the administration's energy policy because itdoesn't go far enough in promoting conservation. And GeorgeFrampton, president of the Wilderness Society, said the plan&quot;perpetuates a decade of error and a decade of reliance onoil that played a big part at getting us into the war&quot; in thePersian Gulf.   Untouched by the revisions is a proposal that wouldsignificantly increase the percentage of fleet vehiclesnationwide that use non-gasoline fuels, such as natural gas.In reworking the other conservation areas, the administrationgenerally embraced proposals that are less aggressive anddon't require legislation. For example, the strategyenvisions an Executive Order by President Bush to encourageenergy efficiency at federal offices and some sort ofclarification by the Treasury Department of its ruling onutility rebates.   The war has given new impetus to congressional efforts tofashion an energy plan that lessens dependence on importedoil. It is generally expected that some sort of energylegislation will pass this year. Many of the measures alreadyproposed on Capitol Hill rely more heavily on conservationand efficiency than the administration plan.   Still, it isn't clear whether Congress or the public willbe willing to embrace costly or painful measures if oilprices remain low. &quot;There's nothing like low gasoline pricesto shift attention away from energy issues, especially whenthere's so many other problems around,&quot; said Elihu Bergman,executive director of Americans for Energy Independence, anonprofit group.   The fleets proposal would expand on Clean Air Actprovisions by requiring increasing percentages of centrallyfueled fleets to begin running on alternative fuels. Acompanion proposal would lift the ceiling on credits thatauto makers can earn if they build alternative-fueled cars;the credit can be applied to meeting federal fuel efficiencyrequirements. The Energy Department estimates that theprovisions would save 780,000 barrels a day of imported oilby 2010.   Production provisions include a renewed call to open theArctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling; tostreamline nuclear plant licensing, and to remove someregulation of oil-and-gas pipelines.   Provisions that don't require congressional action includethose that would encourage states to accelerate programsdesigned to scrap gas-guzzling cars and provide forsignificant increases in research and development spending onenergy technology, including electric vehicles, high-speedrail lines and ways to enhance oil production. The fiscal1992 budget proposed last week calls for $3.5 billion inresearch spending over five years.   On Capitol Hill, the administration plan will facecompetition from a host of energy proposals, including someto expand the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, require thegovernment to set efficiency standards for light bulbs,increase auto fuel efficiency requirements and impose awindfall profits tax on oil companies.   Separately, the Interior Department, carrying through onthe administration's aim of increasing domestic energyoutput, is proposing that new areas off Alaska, Florida,California and the East Coast be opened to oil exploration orstudied for possible leasing. Its five-year offshore oilleasing plan, to be presented to Congress in the next fewweeks, will be the first test of its strategy of limiting theareas to be opened and excluding the most sensitive siteswithin those areas in an effort to placate environmentallysensitive lawmakers.</TEXT></DOC>
