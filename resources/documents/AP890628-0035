On an 8 to 4 vote Tuesday, the council voted to allow shootingvictims and the families of homicide victims to recover monetarydamages from the manufacturer of a gun used in a shooting,regardless of who was at fault.   If given final approval, the measure would be the first such lawin the United States.   Council members said they hope the measure will reduce theavailability of firearms in the district, as well as around thecountry.   ``This is not P.R.,'' said William P. Lightfoot, an at-largecouncil member who backs the legislation. ``If you make a dangerousweapon, we're going to hold you responsible any time it is used.''   Richard R. Atkinson Jr., a member of the board of directors ofthe National Rifle Association and president of the District ofColumbia Firearms Association, warned the council that its actioncould harm home rule for the district. Such a law could give federalopponents new ammunition to attack the district's local government,he said.   ``I think if the city council continues with this kind ofmeddling in other states' affairs, it will go down in history as thecity council that lost home rule,'' Atkinson said.   Council member Betty Ann Kane, who voted against the bill, calledit a ``knee-jerk'' response to street violence. She said she doesnot understand ``why we are taking away individual responsibility''for gun-related crimes.</TEXT></DOC>
