Foreign Minister Pik Botha said his country is prepared to acteven if it delays next week's U.N.-supervised elections that are astep toward Namibian independence from South Africa, its southernneighbor.   Guerrilla leaders accused Botha of trying to sabotage theelection by making false allegations.   Botha told a news conference that Foreign Affairs personnelintercepted messages from U.N. soldiers referring to theinfiltration from Angola of more than 600 guerrillas of theSouth-West Africa People's Organization between Oct. 23 and Oct. 31.   SWAPO's secretary-general, Andimba Toivo ja Toivo, deniedBotha's assertion, saying it was ``'a concoction by the SouthAfrican government in a bid to sabotage the election.''   ``It is well-known that the South African government sends itown troops dressed in other armies' clothing when it wishes tofabricate an offensive maneuver,'' Toivo said.   Eddie Amkongo, a guerrilla spokesman in Windhoek, Namibia,challenged Botha to prove his ``naive and childish remarks.''   ``If it can be proved that Mr. Botha is spreading lies, daysbefore the people of Namibia are about to exercise their democraticrights, SWAPO would have no choice but to assume that South Africahas a hidden agenda.''   But Francois Giuliani, the chief U.N. spokesman, told reportersin New York: ``We are not aware of any such action along theNamibian border ... This is the first we have heard of it.''   Giuliani, responding to a question at a daily news briefing,said Botha had telephoned the U.N. chief at 8:30 a.m. EDT ``toinform the secretary-general of his allegations.''Undersecretary-General Marrack Goulding, in charge of U.N.peacekeeping operations, also was informed, he said.   SWAPO maintained bases in Angola during its 23-year bush waragainst South African rule, but is not supposed to have armedpersonnel in Namibia during the transitional period. Under the U.N.plan, South Africa also withdrew its troops from the territory.   SWAPO is favored to get the most votes in a five-day electionstarting next Tuesday for seats in an assembly that will draft aconstitution for Namibia.   After a Cabinet meeting, Botha said he met with ambassadors ofthe United States, Britain, Canada, West Germany and other Westerncountries, urging them to do whatever they can ``to end this now.''   ``The messages made it clear that SWAPO warned (United Nations)patrols they they shouldn't interfere or they would be shot,''Botha said. ``The tendency of (U.N. peacekeeping troops) is thatthey are wishing to evacuate, to run.''   He said the U.N. peacekeeping force is ``certainly not doing itsjob, it is frightened to do it where SWAPO is involved.''   ``Unless this is resolved within days, the South Africangovernment is reserving the right to take whatever steps would berequired to ensure that all parties comply with theirobligations,'' Botha said. ``The South African security forces havebeen put on alert.''   Botha said military units in Walvis Bay, a South African enclaveon Namibia's coast, had been included in the alert.   If South Africa was forced to act, Botha said, the electiondefinitely would be delayed.   South Africa has ruled Namibia, a former German colony, since1915. In December, South Africa signed accords with Angola and Cubaagreeing to cooperate with a U.N. plan for Namibia's transition toindependence as Cuba withdraws its 50,000 troops from Angola.</TEXT></DOC>
