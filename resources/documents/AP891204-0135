Opposition groups have grown rapidly in two months ofpro-democracy protest, but have not put forth long-term programs.   ``Maybe Hans Modrow can salvage something,'' Fiebelkorn said ofthe premier who is emerging as the nation's main political figure.``We continue to go to work and hope that things will get better.''   East Germany has serious economic problems, intensified by themass exodus to West Germany of nearly 300,000 people, most of themyoung, skilled workers.   In 40 years of communism, East Germany attained a relativelyhigh standard of living compared with other Soviet Bloc countries,but its industry is outdated and the communications network nearcollapse.   Business was done as usual Monday on Leipziger Street, a broadshopping avenue, but the resignations and reports of widespreadcorruption under the old guard Krenz's people replaced were onpeople's minds.   ``I'm not disappointed this happened,'' Scholz said, ``but whatlies in the future? New Fourm, they themselves don't know what todo. They know what was wrong, but have no concept of what to do andno one who can take over.''   Mareike Boettger, 28, expressed outrage at reports of massivecorruption in the party and reports that top officials ledluxurious lives.   ``I don't have anything against a high politician having alittle luxury, but what they have done is shameless,'' she said.``We are glad they are out.''   Of East Germans leaving for the West, she said: ``Those peoplewho are still going there are doing it just for material things. Wehave to stay here and rebuild out economy.   ``To do that we will need foreign investments. We know therewill be many problems, but I have never given a thought to leavinghere.'' Ms. Boettger works at an export company.   Heike Nestler said officials found guilty of corruption shouldbe punished severely, because ``they obtained their luxury at ourexpense and the expense of their own children.   Young people led the movement for democratic reforms because ofthe lack of freedom, she said.   ``It wasn't that we had it bad. We had everything. Young mothershave state-run kindergartens, a lot of support to raise children.But there was no freedom to travel. To get permission to travel youhad to kneel on the ground and beg.''   Mario Kalischer, 26, walking his wife Isabina, 21, said he was aCommunist Party member, and ``for us, this corruption is a bigdisappointment.''   ``We no longer trusted them. Even Krenz. ... Those people weresupposed to set an example.   ``I find it good that they are out. ... It needed to be cleanedout completely. But what happens now, that's the big question?Without the party nothing will work.''</TEXT></DOC>
