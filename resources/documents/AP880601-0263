(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Criticism of the Reaganadministration's national parks policy over alleged budget cuts isbased on a ``pernicious mythology,'' a top Interior Departmentofficial said Wednesday.   William Horn, assistant secretary for Fish, Wildlife and Parks,told a conference of more than 300 park superintendents he wastired of ``a continuing drumbeat of critics claiming theadministration is anti-park and committers of sins.''   Horn said the National Park Service's 1980 operating budget was$391 million compared with $734 million that the administration hasproposed for the next fiscal year begining July 1.   ``That constitutes the largest operating budget in the historyof the National Park Service and represents 29 percentpost-inflation, real growth over the past seven years,'' Horn said.   During the Carter administration, he said, the park service got9 percent of the Interior Department's aggregate budget, comparedwith the current 14 percent.   Further, Horn said, the park service employees 16,414 people,the highest level in its 72-year history.   ``These numbers,'' he said, ``bespeak a commitment to a firstclass national park system and they are at odds with the currentpernicious mythology.''   Earlier, Horn challenged Rep. Bruce F. Vento's introduction of abill to reorganize the park service's hierarchy to make itindependent, saying it wasn't necessary because ``if it ain'tbroke, don't fix it.''   Vento, D-Minn., opened the four-day conference by telling thepark superintendents that they ``do the nearly impossible job dayafter day (of) protecting the greatest treasures in the UnitedStates _ the national park system.   Vento, chairman of the national parks and public landssubcommittee of the House Interior and Insular Affairs Committee,has introduced a bill in Congress to take away the interiorsecretary's power over the national park system. The bill wouldgive that power directly to the park service director and athree-member oversight board that would report to Congress and thepresident.   Currently, National Park Service Director William Penn Mottreports to Interior Secretary Donald Hodel through Horn.   Mott addressed the parks superintendents earlier in the day,saying the Park Service must become more effective in dealing withoutside threats to park resources because ``we cannot achieve ourgoals if we continue to try and solve problems in a crisisatmosphere.''   ``If the last decade has taught us anything, it is that parksare no longer islands,'' Mott said. ``I have often told you (parksuperintendents) that I want you to be risk-takers. Then, even ifthe risks are high, select the one that most benefits the resourcesof the park.''   Vento spoke in the same vein during his address. He saidincreasing pressures on the park system due to diminishing naturalresources and a burgeoning population have led to ``pressures ofcertain segments of society to take actions detrimental to (basiclaws) which protect the national park system.''   Environmental and citizens' groups cite logging, oil drillingand commercial and residential development near parks, as well asman-made pollution, as just some of the threats to the 341 sites inthe national park system.   ``The result of these conflicts has been a rapidly escalatingprocess whereby professional resource managers' decision-making hasbeen overshadowed by political decision-making,'' said Vento.   He said such interference tempts park managers to make choicesbased on short-term needs rather than long-term protection goals.   At an informal news conference Wednesday prior to his speech tothe superintendents, Horn said Vento's bill to reorganize the parkservice hierarchy is unnecessary.   ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it,'' said Horn. ``When you marryup senior political management with senior career management,that's the healthiest combination. To separate that good ...marriage, I think, would be a mistake.''   Vento said his proposal would protect park managers with ``somedegree of independence ... so (they) can freely and publicly voiceopposition to an action that might degrade park resources withoutfear of being fired, demoted, or punished.''   ``This would provide for a management framework that permits awitness to testify before a congressional subcommittee and presenta professional viewpoint rather than a political one imposed byothers with little professional knowledge or interest,'' said Vento.   Asked about Vento's statement that implied park servicepersonnel appearing before Congress are constrained fromdisagreeing with park service management policies if they feel theyare detrimental to their park, Horn said, ``I reject thatcategorically.''   During the three years he and Mott have been in their respectivejobs, said Horn, the interior secretary has had ``a standing orderthat if you are asked, you can relate'' personal views about parkpolicy, whether it agrees with the administration agenda or not.   Paul Pritchard, president of the National Parks and ConservationAssociation, a non-profit citizens' group that focuses on thenational parks system, said: ``We are 100 percent behindCongressman Vento's bill. We are completely committed to it.''   T. Destry Jarvis, the association's vice president, describedthe last seven years of the Reagan administration's management ofthe Park Service as ``a constant tug of war between a citizenrythat is committed to the parks system, a Congress which is quiteprotective of the parks system, and an administration which isnot.''</TEXT></DOC>
