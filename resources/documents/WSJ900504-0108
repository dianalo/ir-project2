The rise in numbers of single parents, unmarried couples,and people living alone isn't unique to the U.S. A Bureau ofLabor Statistics study found that these situations are commonto most countries in the developed world. The difference isin the pace at which these trends are progressing.   Four main factors have changed the look of households andfamilies in the past two decades: Women are having fewerchildren, more women are having children out of wedlock,populations are aging, and marriage is down while divorce isup.   Japan remains the most traditional of the 13 developednations studied, with low rates of divorce and low rates ofout-of-wedlock births. It also has the largest share ofmarried couples.   Sweden and Germany have the largest shares ofsingle-person households, in part because they have olderpopulations.   Scandinavia has been setting the pace for out-of-wedlockbirths and cohabitation. Sweden and Denmark have the largestshares of births to unmarried women. Yet they don't have thehighest shares of single parents, because many unmarriedmothers in these countries live with partners.   It's not clear which country has the highest share ofcohabiting couples because some countries now include themwith married couples in official household statistics. Oneestimate shows that virtually all young Swedes cohabit beforethey marry.   The U.S. tops the list for single parents, partly becauseof high divorce rates, but also because American singleparents are more likely to be young never-married women ontheir own, rather than cohabitors.                                                                                                          If Time Is Money,   Soviets Need More                                                                                                          CONTRARY to popular opinion, Japanese men don't work morethan everyone else. It is Soviet men who hold this dubioushonor.   Researchers at the University of Michigan compared timeuse in eight countries -- Japan, the U.S., U.S.S.R., Finland,Hungary, Norway, Denmark, and Sweden -- and found that theaverage Soviet man spends 54 hours a week earning a living,compared with 52 hours for Japanese men and 44 hours forAmerican men. Danish men spend only 33 hours.   Danish men consequently have the most leisure time, anaverage of 54 hours a week. Japanese men have 40 hours ofleisure time while American men have 41. Soviet men, who workmore because of low wages, have only 35 hours of free time.   Personal care, including eating and sleeping, ranges from67 hours a week for men in Denmark to over 72 hours for thosein Japan, Finland and Hungary.   Their other time-eater is the age-old women's activity:housework. Swedish men are the most egalitarian in this,doing 18 hours of housework a week. American men spend 14hours a week on household chores, and Soviet men contribute12 hours. Japanese men do just 3.5 hours a week.   In all of the countries studied, women spend less timethan men earning a living and more time doing housework. Trueto stereotypes, women also spend more time than men onpersonal care, except in Japan and Hungary. Women have aboutthe same amount of leisure time as men in the U.S., Japan,Norway, Sweden and Denmark. In the Soviet Union, Finland, andHungary, however, women have less leisure time than men.                                                                                                          Stacking Up the Cities   For U.S. Expatriates                                                                                                          IF YOU HAD to relocate, which international city would bethe most like home in terms of living costs? Hint: Have avodka.   Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm inRochester, Wis., measured living costs in major cities aroundthe world. The yardstick was a family of four, with annualincome of $75,000, living in Everywhere, U.S.A., where costsare average for the nation. The study included costs forhousing, transportation, and goods and services such as foodand clothing. It didn't include taxes, whose impact variesgreatly with employer policy.   To maintain the family's standard of living, it would cost$74,200 in Moscow, putting that city on a par with home. Romealso comes close, with a cost of $73,600. Warsaw is thebargain basement among cities studied, with a comparable costof $40,800.   In Toronto and Mexico City, the comparable cost of livingis lower than in the U.S., at $62,900 and $63,900respectively. Stockholm is higher, at $83,800.   The highest costs of all are in Asia. To maintain a familyof four in Seoul would take twice as much as it does in theU.S., $151,300. In Tokyo, the costs skyrocket to $207,200 --but that figure is based on a six-room home, a serious luxuryin land-scarce Japan.                                                                                                          It Isn't Just the Geese   Migrating From Canada                                                                                                          AS OF THE 1980 Census, there were 843,000 Canadian-bornpeople living in the U.S. In the other direction, the 1981Canadian census found 302,000 U.S.-born people living inCanada, according to Statistics Canada, an Ontario agency.   During the past few decades, migration between the twocountries has slowed, due to immigration restrictions on bothsides. Currently, about 16,000 Canadians move to the U.S.each year, and fewer than 10,000 Americans move to Canada.</TEXT></DOC>
