But it has started making money.    In its first annual report, MIGA, a World Bank affiliate, reported that its income from investments totaled about $5.9 million in the year ended June 30; net income, after administrative expenses and other outlays, totaled $2.8 million.    MIGA, which has $702.5 million in capital subscribed by member countries, reported that in mid-1989 it had almost $67.3 million of investments in interest-bearing time deposits and other obligations with banks and other financial institutions. In a footnote to the annual report, MIGA said it isn't disclosing where these assets are parked.    Technically, Barber Conable, president of the World Bank, also is president of MIGA, although MIGA's operating chief is Yoshio Terasawa, formerly an official of Nomura Securities Co., Tokyo, a major international investment and securities company.    In the report, MIGA said that during the past year, it has been setting up its staff and laying the groundwork for providing private investment guarantees for projects in Third World countries.    MIGA said it has received 69 preliminary applications for guarantees covering potential investments in 24 developing countries.    Once MIGA gets rolling with its investment guarantees, the insurance-type agreements will protect companies in industrial countries, for example, against expropriation, currency inconvertibility, wars, revolutions or &quot;civil disturbances&quot; and other non-commercial risks on their new investments in Third World nations that are signatories to the MIGA charter.    MIGA said its &quot;multilateral&quot; investment guarantees will supplement the national investment-guarantee programs of its member countries and political-risk insurance of insurers. </TEXT></DOC>
