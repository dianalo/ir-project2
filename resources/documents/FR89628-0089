Consequently, any radiological releasesresulting from an accident would not be significantly greater than previouslydetermined. The proposed amendments do not otherwise affect routine radiologicalplant effluents. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are nosignificant radiological environmental impacts associated with the proposedamendments. The Commission also concludes that the proposed action willnot result in a significant increase in individual or cumulative occupationalradiation exposure.With regard to nonradiological impacts, the proposed amendments do notaffect nonradiological plant effluents and have no other environmentalimpact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that there are no significantnonradiological environmental impacts associated with the proposed amendments.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on February 14, 1989 (54 FR 6791). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.Alternatives to the Proposed ActionBecause the Commission has concluded that there are no significant environmentalimpacts associated with the proposed action, there is no need to examinealternatives to the proposed action.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of resources not previously consideredin connection with the Final Environmental Statement related to operationof San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station, Unit 2 and 3, dated April 1981and its Errata dated June 1981.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's request that supports the proposedamendments. The NRC staff did not consult other agencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed amendments.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, the Commission concludesthat the proposed action will not have a significant effect on the qualityof the human environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendments dated December 29, 1988, which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington,DC 20555, and at the General Library, University of California, P.O.
