Failures were big, such as budget deficits and negative tradebalances, and an inability to show statistically that Federalspending had indeed been reduced as a percentage of gross nationalproduct.   Important parts of the vision were maintained, however, and theimpact of some of them can be seen in domestic and world politicsand economics, perhaps even in the overthrow of communist regimes.   One of the primary aims of the administration was to bringinflation and interest rates down by freeing the economy fromregulatory controls, restraining the money supply and loweringspending.   Such action was needed in order for other plans to work. InDecember 1980, the prime rate had reached a record 21.5 percent andthree-month Treasury bills had doubled in yield in a matter ofmonths.   Better control of the money supply, thanks to Federal Reservecooperation, helped reverse the climb in rates. An immediate taxcut not only stimulated economic activity but helped take inflationdown from double-digit levels.   The Economic Report of the President, sent to Congress inFebruary 1982, expressed the broad hopes. ``A critical element inthis outlook is the assumption that inflationary expectations willcontinue to recede,'' it said.   If the process continued as expected, the report stated,``market rates of interest will decline significantly, wage demandswill continue to moderate, and the pro-inflationary biases ... willquickly disappear.''   They did, and the impact continues today.   However, a far greater impact of the Reagan plan for the decadecan be traced to the report's section on government and theeconomy. It had domestic and international ramifications.   The section begins with this preamble:   _``All nations which have broad-based representative governmentand civil liberties have most of their economic activity organizedby the market.   _``Economic conditions in market economies are generallysuperior to those in nations (with a comparable culture and acomparable resource base) in which the government has the dominanteconomic role.''   A major objective of the Reagan economic program, therefore, was:   ``... to reduce the Federal government's role in economicdecision-making while strengthening the economic role ofindividuals, private organizations and state and localgovernments.''   That objective, the report stated, emanated from a belief that:   ``... the politicization of price decisions _ whether of wages,commodities, or interest rates _ tends to reduce both the breadthof popular support for the government and the efficiency of theeconomy.''   Nations all over the world, large and small, socialist,capitalist and mixed, took their cue from the United States,developing the concept of privatization, or turning overgovernmental functions to the private sector.   In every instance the goal was the same, to achieve economicefficiency _ a higher level of responsiveness to individual andcollective needs _ by drawing on the creative self-interest ofprivate individuals and institutions.   The revolution was smoothly accomplished in mostly capitalistnations, sometimes convulsively in socialist economies, but to somedegree it occurred almost everywhere.   Historians eventually will unravel the reasons for theeconomic-political upheavals in the late 1980s, but even now theycan follow one fine thread to that 1982 economic report.   It was written by Chairman Murray L. Weidenbaum and membersJerry L. Jordan and William A. Niskanen, and transmitted toCongress on February 6, 1982.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Friday, Dec. 29.</NOTE></DOC>
