Montgomery Ward said Monday that an investor group led bypresident and chief executive Bernard Brennan would acquire thecompany from Mobil in a $3.8 billion leveraged buyout.   The group, which also includes General Electric Capital Corp.,will pay more than $1.5 billion in cash for the 115-year-old,Chicago-based company and assume $2.3 billion of its debt.   ``This is a historic day for Montgomery Ward,'' Brennan told anews conference. ``We've gone through an awful lot over the years.``In 1987, we earned $130 million after taxes. In 1980, we had $162million loss after taxes.''   Faced with a financial drain from the retailer during the early1980s, Mobil _ which acquired Montgomery Ward in 1976 for about $1billion _ has wanted to sell the chain for some time. Brennan,credited with turning the retailer around in recent years, had beennegotiating for months to acquire the company.   ``It's a business that we don't know too well,'' said Mobilchairman Allen E. Murray. He also said New York-based Mobil, thenation's second-largest oil company, believed it would be best toconcentrate on its core businesses.   Murray said in a telephone interview Monday that Mobil beganreceiving inquiries about Montgomery Ward last summer, but declinedto identify the other parties interested in buying the retailer.   Mobil stock rose $1.12{ to $44.75 in New York Stock Exchangetrading on Monday.   Brennan said GE Capital, a unit of General Electric Co., willtake over Ward's credit-card operation.   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy out acompany and then pay off the debt with the target company's cashflow or the sale of its assets.   But Brennan said the company has no plans to sell other assetsor to lay off any employees under the buyout plan, which takeseffect in 60 days.   ``We see no need at this time to reduce employment. For example,in Chicago, we've added 300 jobs in the last six months,'' Brennansaid.   ``This is not a leveraged buyout that says, `Let's shrink thecompany.'''   During its comeback effort, Montgomery Ward laid off 17,000employees, closed its Jefferson Ward discount stores and otherunprofitable branches, and shut down the catalog division thatdated back to the company's early days.   It moved into specialty retailing, opening appliance andelectronics stores, and is converting its department stores toemphasize specialty formats including electronics, home furnishingsand recreational items.   Last month, Montgomery Ward announced it was realigning itsfield-office management to create new specialty retailing positions.   ``Our customers are middle America. We don't want to be tooavant garde, and we don't want to be downscale.'' said Brennan, aformer executive of Chicago-based Sears, Roebuck and Co.   ``Consumers have the advantage that we have people running thebusiness that owns the business,'' Brennan said. ``Independencegives us much more flexibility.''   Mobil has not indicated what it would do with the money from thesale. Energy analyst Bruce Lazier, of the investment firm Prescott,Ball andamp; Turben, said he believed corporate capital investment willreceive the largest share.   ``My guess is that, that will reduce their short-term debt andthat gives them an extra $2 billion of funds available number onefor reinvestment in capital expenditures if the opportunities ariseand, number two, gives them flexibility to increase dividends andshare repurchase plans,'' Lazier said in a telephone interview.</TEXT></DOC>
