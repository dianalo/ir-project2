L. 99-499, section 126(g), enactedon October 17, 1986, authorizes a program of grants for the training andeducation of workers who are or are likely to be engaged in activitiesrelated to hazardous waste removal or containment or emergency response.The program is to be administered by the National Institute of EnvironmentalHealth Sciences. The intent of the Department of Health and Human Servicesto promulgate regulations to implement this new authority is announcedin the latest HHS Regulatory Agenda, under the section for the NationalInstitutes of Health, Public Health Service.Section 126(g)(3) of Pub. L. 99-499 states that grants shall be awardedto nonprofit organizations which demonstrate experience in implementingand operating worker health and safety training and education programsand demonstrate the ability to reach and involve in training programs targetpopulations of workers who are or are likely to be engaged in hazardouswaste removal or containment or emergency response operations. In the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of December 19, 1986 [51 FR 45556] a full descriptionof the program was given and the public was invited to an open meetingon this program on January 12, 1987.The purpose of this notice is to invite public comment on the regulationswhich will be used to implement the authorization contained in section126(g) of Pub. L. 99-499. Up to $10 million per year for fiscal years 1987-1991has been authorized to be appropriate to support this grant program. Thesedollar amounts are budget ceilings and actual amounts will be appropriatedeach year consistent with the Federal budget process.The following information is provided for the information of the public:1. These proposed regulations would govern the award and administrationof grants under section 126(g) of Pub. L. 99-499. The economic impact ofthis program is expected to be minor. For this reason, the Secretary haddetermined that this rule is not a ``major rule under Executive Order 12291,and a regulatory impact analysis is not required. Further, these regulationswill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities, and therefore do not require a regulatory flexibility analysisunder the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980.2. Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistance program number affected by thisproposed rule is: 13.1423. Section 64a.4 of these proposed rules contains information collectionrequirements. As required by section 3504(h) of the Paperwork ReductionAct of 1980 [44 U.S.C. 3504(h)], we have submitted a copy of these proposedrules to the Office of Management and Budget for its review of these informationcollection requirements. Organizations and individuals desiring to submitcomments on the information collection requirements should direct themto the agency official designated for this purpose whose name appears inthis preamble, and to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs,OMB, New Executive Office Building (Room 3206), Washington, DC 20503, Attn:Desk Officer for HHS.4. These proposed regulations do not require either a Federalism or FamilyImpact analysis. There is no effect on states or on the role and responsibilitiesof the family, as defined in Executive Order 12291 on Federalism and ExecutiveOrder 12606 on the Family, because the NPRM merely describes the Secretary'sauthority to issue grants under this program.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 42 CFR Part 64a</ITAG>Education study programs, Grant programs_education, Grant programs_health,Manpower training programs.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: March 3, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Robert E.
