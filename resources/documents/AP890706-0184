(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Former PTL executive David Taggart bought$100,000 worth of jewelry and spent $400,000 on other things thesame year he told the IRS his gross adjusted income was $107,000, atax attorney testified Thursday.   ``Did the defendant ever tell you how he could purchase itemsworth $500,000 when his income was $100,000?'' Justice Departmentprosecutor David Brown asked former PTL tax attorney Robert Gunst.   ``It looks like a mistake was made,'' said Gunst, who preparedTaggart's 1984 tax return.   David Taggart and his brother, James, were indicted in Decemberon charges of failing to pay $487,000 in income taxes. Prosecutorssay they diverted $1.1 million of ministry funds to their personaluse by taking cash advances on PTL credit cards and using blankministry checks to pay the credit card bills.   Other purchases questioned Thursday included a one-bedroomapartment on the 57th floor of New York's Trump Tower, which Gunstsaid the two brothers bought in 1986 for $640,000.   They had previously leased an apartment in the same building,Gunst said, and James Taggart deducted his $2,000-a-month share ofthe rent because he claimed he used the apartment for business andwhile taking classes.   Gunst said Taggart was entitled to the deduction if he wasstaying at the apartment while furthering his education. But he saidhe did not know if Taggart actually attended classes in New York.   The tax attorney also said PTL founder Jim Bakker approved usingministry funds to pay $52,000 in back taxes and penalties leviedagainst David Taggart after an audit of his 1981 and 1982 taxreturns.   Gunst said he found ``25 to 30'' boxes of credit card receiptsduring an IRS audit of the ministry, and was worried that spendingby the Taggart brothers could threaten PTL's tax-exempt status.   ``I told him (David Taggart) it was extremely important for himto keep good records of his travel expenses and credit cardpurchases,'' Gunst said.   He also said he never asked Taggart about using PTL money forpersonal expenses.   Both Taggarts joined the ministry in the late 1970s as pianists.Within a few years, David Taggart, 32, became Bakker's top aide andJames, 35, was the ministry's interior designer. Both were firedafter Bakker resigned in 1987 in the midst of a sex-and-moneyscandal.   James Taggart's interior design business was paid hundreds ofthousands of dollars to decorate the hotels and other projects thatsprang up at Heritage USA, PTL's Christian retreat in Fort Mill, S.C.   Patricia Harris, who became Bakker's executive secretary in 1984,testified that David Taggart asked her for several cash advancesfrom PTL's numerous checking accounts.   Prosecutor Joseph Bender asked her if Taggart, her immediatesupervisor, was required to give her receipts.   ``No, he said it was used for the Bakkers,'' she said. ``He wouldjust tell me he was keeping his own receipts. He said he kept themat home in shoe boxes.''   ``Why didn't you demand that David Taggart turn over thereceipts?'' Bender asked.   ``Because I considered him the same as Mr. Bakker or Mr.Dortch,'' she said, referring to Richard Dortch, a former top Bakkeraide. ``They were my supervisors. I asked, I didn't demand.''   The trial of the two brothers is expected to take up to a month.If convicted, they each could face 25 years in prison and fines ofmore than $1 million.</TEXT></DOC>
