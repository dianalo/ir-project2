 An estimated 7,500 of the 150,000 herdsof beef cattle in Britain, say health authorities, include animals identifiedas suffering from bovine spongiform encephalopathy.andP;  BSE is commonly known asmad cow disease.andP;  The cows are mad, according to some sources, because theywere fed infected sheep's brains, although there are some other conjecturesregarding the vectors for this disease.andP;  It isn't clear whether humans aresusceptible to BSE.andP;  But if there is a possibility of inter-speciestransmission, the chances of infection are far greater if somebody eats nervetissue from an infected animal.andP;  Lengthy stories have appeared in thenewspapers, some of them critical of sausage makers, beef packers and thelike.andP;  While there are regulations ostensibly governing the kind of tissuethat can be used in foodstuffs prepared for human consumption, seriousquestions have been raised about the adequacy of enforcement.andP;  Consumers,reasonably enough, are frightened.andP;  And some nations in the EuropeanCommunity that import British beef - France, for instance - have institutedbans.andP;  This cattle war led Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's government tothreaten retaliation, and put her Administration in the position of defendingthe safety of British products even though the atmosphere of seriousscientific conjecture over the issue has not yet cleared.andM;Well-boiled veggiesandM;The British are proud of their beef, and like nothing better than a goodroast.andP;  They also hate to be criticised by other nations, particularly theFrench.andP;  Government officials have responded with rhetoric unprecedentedsince the war over the Falklands.andP;  &quot;If there are some people who do not wantto believe that it [the beef] is safe,&quot; said agriculture minister DavidMacLean in a state of high dudgeon, &quot;God help them.andP;  Let them wallow in theirpathetic little panic.andP;  But let them keep their mouths shut and not scare thevast majority of us who have common sense.&quot; Whether the minister washed downhis ire with a heaping portion of beef tartare was not reported by thenewspaper we saw.andP;  And while the John Bull hasn't switched en masse to Sundaydinners of tofu au jus with Yorkshire pudding and phenomenally well-boiledveggies, a visitor senses that the Brits are quietly cutting back on theirformerly favoured cuts.andP;  Against this background of a potentially deadlyinfection, possibly transmitted by the use of one species' grey matter in thediet of another, IBM has been sending up trial balloons for a process thatbears a frightening similarity to the more horrifying alleged practices ofBritish farmers.andM;According to rumours that appear to be fostered by Big Blue itself, IBM may -after spending countless man-years and billions of dollars on research,development and engineering - unveil as its next generation of mainframes aline of systems based on brain transplants.andP;  Popular hypotheses about IBM'snext generation don't crop up without cause.andP;  They are usually promulgated bygurus working for the powerful consulting organisations that have grownimpressively corpulent in recent years.andM;By Hesh WienerandM;These trusted advisors have mastered the process of gleaning five-figure sumsfrom the lush budgets of corporate information processing departments.andP;  Theirstock in trade includes an implied inside knowledge of IBM's strategy, andthe best-regarded of the consultants do seem to have good contacts within theBlue Empire.andP;  A rich symbiotic relationship has arisen among the pundits,IBMers and users.andP;  There is a great body of circumstantial evidence thatindicates IBM tests ideas with the help of consultants and certain users byplanting hints about its possible future moves and then harvesting thereactions.andP;  This process was visible during the gestation of the AS/400 andagain during the development of the RS/6000.andP;  The same phenomenon has croppedup in conjunction with IBM's forthcoming mainframe announcements, widelybelieved - via carefully orchestrated leaks, we suspect - to be slated forSeptember.andP;  If the market has reacted favourably to planted or imaginedrumours, IBM will set off on its journey to what is widely referred to as theSummit series (an ill-chosen name that suggests IBM may soon peak out) byunveiling new cabinets housing old circuits.andP;  Why any customer would pay fora new sheet-metal crate that cannot perform one iota of work is as complete amystery as the workings of mad cow disease.andP;  But the Blue miasma surroundingthe story forces us to take it at least half seriously.andP;  Officially, IBM willnot comment on forthcoming announcements.andP;  One might as well ask a cow if ithas BSE.andP;  But in a very special forum, such as a recent meeting beforesecurities analysts, IBM may foreshadow its plans, albeit in a most delphicmanner.andP;  Our friends on Wall Street say that IBM was only a little morespecific than a potentially mad cow.andP;  Most of what the company said was aspredictable as the cow's moo moo.andP;  IBM basically told Wall Street moola moola(which the company's chairman pronounces boola boola).andP;  Big Blue, thetrusting analysts were persuaded, will somehow make big money off mainframesthis year and next.andP;  One of the fundamental aspects of business is a certainsymmetry.andP;  For IBM to take in money, customers have to spend it.andP;  Under thebest of circumstances, both parties profit - IBM by selling iron for lotsmore than it costs to build, users by getting so much value from theirsystems that their enterprises bring more money to the bottom line.andM;Donald TrumpandM;It is, of course, possible for only one side of the deal to come out ahead,or for neither to be satisfied.andP;  Last year, IBM clearly did not sell itsgoods and services for a lot more than cost, and even reported anunprecedented loss in its US business.andP;  Customers didn't do so hot either,although this year may prove to be even more difficult for the businesscommunity as a whole.andP;  For causes that can hardly be traced back tocomputation centres, large segments of the American economy regretfully findDonald Trump to be an appropriate figurehead, or perhaps dunderhead.andP;  InEurope, where IBM has been making the bulk of its profit, there are signalsthat economic growth may be slowing.andP;  This is particularly important to IBMand its trusting investors because Big Blue's anticipated success will notcome to pass if computers are sold primarily on a defensive basis.andP;  Rather,IBM can only return to prosperity if customers are installing systems to helpthem extend and enrich their enterprises.andP;  To the extent that userorganisations perceive their information processing departments as costly,general management will put pressure on computing executives to trim costsfirst and add capabilities second.andP;  Parsimony may be a good idea even inprosperous times, but when an enterprise is under pressure, belt-tighteningforces computing departments to look favourably on a strategy that spells bigtrouble for IBM: downsizing.andP;  In September, IBM may unveil a compellinglyattractive growth path for customers with large systems.andP;  But the companycould just as easily fail.andP;  If IBM doesn't give customers a practical reasonto expand their large systems strategies, it may be faced with a 3090 basethat is scrambling to offload work to AS/400s, air-cooled ESA machines and,very possibly, systems from competitors.andP;  The customers are no longer docile.andO;But what should IBM expect? Even the cows are mad these days.(C) 1990Technology News of America Co</TEXT></DOC>
