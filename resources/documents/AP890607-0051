On the Tokyo Stock Exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average,which slipped 5.07 points Tuesday, rose 174.88 points, or 0.52percent, closing at 33,626.89. The index had fallen four straightdays since Thursday.   The dollar ended trading at 142.80 yen, up 0.17 yen fromTuesday's 142.63-yen finish. After opening at 142.45 yen, thecurrency ranged between 142.40 and 143.00 yen.   Toru Kanai, foreign exchange analyst with New Japan SecuritiesCo., said the unstable Chinese situation encouraged dollar buying,but speculation that the U.S. Federal Reserve Board might cutinterest rates also gave participants a reason to sell the U.S.currency.   ``We had a lot of dollar buying because many investors believethe U.S. money is a safe investment in time of emergencies,'' hesaid. ``But they didn't want to hold too many dollars either becauseof expectations the Fed might cut its interest rates soon.''   Investors speculate the Federal Reserve may ease its monetarypolicy following the cut in the prime lending rate on Monday bymajor U.S. banks.   Kanai said there were unconfirmed rumors that the Bank of Japanintervened in the market to support the yen when the dollar hit the143-yen mark. ``It had no impact on the market,'' he said.   The central bank usually does not comment officially on itsmarket interventions.   On the stock market, dealers said the Nikkei index began to riseas investors picked up cheap issues following the four days oflosses.   But trading was basically directionless because of uncertaintiesover political unrest in China, which made many institutionalinvestors remain on the sidelines, said a trader with a majorsecurities firm.   Speculative buying pushed up the index, he said, speaking oncondition of anonymity.   Trading was moderate, with volume on the market's first sectionestimated at 600 million shares, up from Tuesday's 550 millionshares. Among the winners were steel and construction issues.</TEXT></DOC>
