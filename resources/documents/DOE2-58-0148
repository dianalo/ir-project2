<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-58-0148 </DOCNO><TEXT>The foreoptics, fiber optic system and calibration source of the AirborneVisible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) are described. The foreoptics,based on a modified Kennedy scanner, is coupled by optical fibers tothe four spectrometers. The optical fibers allow convenient positioningof the spectrometers in the limited space and enable simple compensationof the scanner's thermal defocus (at the -23 C operating temp) by activecontrol of the fiber focal plane position. A challenging requirementfor the fiber optic system was the transmission to the spectral range1.85 to 2.45 microns at .45 numerical aperture. This was solved withcustom fluoride glass fibers from Verre Fluore. The onboard calibrationsource is also coupled to the spectrometers by the fibers and providestwo radiometric levels and a reference spectrum to check the spectrometers'alignment. Results of the performance of the assembled subsystems arepresented. 5 references.</TEXT></DOC>
