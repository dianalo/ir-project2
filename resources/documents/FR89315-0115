The affirmed notice regardingapplication for reconsideration will soon be published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.The company provided additional information claiming that it was substantiallyinvolved in geological exploration on oil and gas lease properties through1986.On reconsideration, the Department found that Kirkwood Oil andamp; Gas hasbeen historically involved in geological exploration on oil and gas leaseproperties. Approximately half of Kirkwood's revenues were derived fromgeological prospecting through 1986. Kirkwood's prospecting revenues decreasedin 1986 compared to 1985 and declined to only a minor share of its totalrevenues in 1988.The exploration and drilling end of the crude oil and natural gas industryis particularly sensitive to the level of imports and changes in the priceof crude oil. The impact of crude oil imports and reduced price levelshas resulted in sharply declining U.S. exploration and drilling activitysince 1985. The total number of U.S. wells completed dropped in 1985, 1986and 1987.The declines in revenues at Kirkwood Oil andamp; Gas and the declines inemployment in 1985 and 1986 resulted from a decreased demand for explorationand drilling activities from oil and gas industry clients due to the 32percent increase in U.S. crude oil imports between 1985 and 1987 and the66 percent drop in U.S. oil wells drilled between 1984 and 1987.The preponderance of activities performed by workers of Kirkwood Oil andamp;Gas after 1986 are not related to oil and gas drilling and exploration;therefore, workers of the firm from January 1, 1987 to October 31, 1987are not eligible for the retroactive provisions of section 1421(a)(1)(B)of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Workers of KirkwoodOil and Gas falling under the provisions of the Trade Act prior to the1988 amendments are outside the scope of the Act since they do not producean article within the meaning of section 222(3) of the Act. Accordingly,a termination date of January 1, 1987 is set in the revised notice of determination.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>After careful review of the additional facts obtained on reconsideration,it is concluded that increased imports of articles like or directly competitivewith crude oil contributed importantly to the decline in exploration activitiesand to the total or partial separation of workers at Kirkwood Oil andamp;Gas, Casper, Wyoming. In accordance with the provisions of the Act andthe retroactive provisions of section 1421(a)(1)(B) of the Omnibus Tradeand Competitiveness Act of 1988, I make the following revised determination:<ITAG tagnum="21">All workers of Kirkwood Oil andamp; Gas, Casper, Wyoming who becametotally or partially separated from employment on or after October 1, 1985and before January 1, 1987 are eligible to apply for adjustment assistanceunder Section 223 of the Trade Act of 1974.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Signed at Washington, DC, this 2nd day of March 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Barbara Ann Farmer,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="4">Director, Office of Program Management, UIS.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 89-5960 Filed 3-14-89; 8:45 am]</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4510-30-M</ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
