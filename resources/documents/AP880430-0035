The leaflet said ``the blood of our martyrs must not be spilledfor nothing.''   It was released on one of the quietest Moslem Sabbaths inmonths. No injuries were reported despite calls for protests tohonor the 175 Palestinians killed in the anti-occupation violencesince it began Dec. 8.   Israeli officials, encouraged by the relative quiet this pastweek, have claimed the ``intefadah'' _ Arabic for ``uprising'' _was fading.   The latest leaflet, signed as usual by the ``United Leadershipof the Uprising,'' called for more general strikes and ``days ofconfrontation with occupation forces.''   It also named four Israeli-appointed mayors who have refused theunderground's demands to resign, urging ``our masses to strike theseverest blows against those ... who are violating our wills andorders.''   The leaflet singled out the mayors of the West Bank towns ofHebron, Ramallah, El Bireh and Jericho.   Scattered protests were reported following Moslem noon prayersFriday.   In Gaza City, soldiers fired tear gas to disperse several dozenyouths who hurled stones after prayers, Arab reports said. Troopsalso fired rubber bullets at worshipers in the nearby Jabaliyarefugee camp, the reports said.   In Jerusalem Friday, hundreds of Moslem worshipers wavedoutlawed Palestinian flags on the sacred Temple Mount chanting:``Jews leave! The prophet Mohammed's army is coming!''   The protesters chanted praise for Khalil Wazir, the PLO militaryleader who was gunned down April 16 in Tunis. Israeli sources haveconfirmed that Israeli commandos were responsible, but thegovernment has denied comment.   In southern Lebanon, Israeli troops and their Lebanese militiaallies raided two villages on Friday, questioning residents abouttwo guerrilla attacks in Israel this week.   The army said two militiamen from the Israeli-backed SouthLebanon Army were killed when their vehicle ran over a land mine ona side road in Israel's self-proclaimed ``security zone'' north ofthe border.   On Tuesday, two Israeli soldiers and three Palestinianguerrillas were killed in a clash after the Arabs crossed intonorthern Israel. In a second incursion Wednesday, two guerrillaswere killed.   Gen. Yossi Peled, head of the army's northern command, pointed afinger Friday at Syria for helping the guerrillas.   ``Without a doubt, these recent operations came from an areaunder Syrian influence,'' Peled told Israel television.   Israel radio said troops entered the villages of Kfar Hamam andRachaiya El Foukhar, four and six miles north of the Israeliborder, to question residents about the attacks. Security sourcesin Lebanon said they were told five Lebanese had been detained. Thearmy declined comment on the report.
