The street, which normally would have been crowded with Saturdayshoppers, cleared as the boisterous demonstrators arrived. Manyonlookers crowded into the small shops lining the street or huddledin doorways as the mass of whooping, chanting marchers passed.   The protesters wore red headbands and waved their traditionaltribal weapons.   They marched to police headquarters, where Inkatha Youth leaderThemba Khoza read a page-long statement to the station commander,who listened silently on the other side of iron bars.   ``Inkatha members are being harassed by the South African policein both the hostels and townships. This must stop,'' Khoza said.   He suggested the police force was ``trying to appease certainpolitical organizations and is being intimidated by them.''   He apparently referred to the African National Congress,Inkatha's main rival. Fighting between supporters of Inkatha andthe ANC has killed thousands of blacks since 1985 in eastern NatalProvince.   The violence spread to black townships around Johannesburg inAugust, killing about 800 blacks in two months.   The ANC has also accused police of bias, alleging they havesupported Inkatha in the fighting.   The station commander, Col. D.B. Keyter, told Khoza he wouldforward the petition to Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok. Keyteralso told Khoza, ``We are not involved in politics whatsoever.''   The Inkatha statement also complained its members were beingarrested for carrying their traditional weapons, which the marchersproudly displayed.   These included pangas, or machetes; knobkerries, wooden stickswith a knob at the top; sjamboks, or whips; spears; and shields.There was also at least one shovel in the crowd, and an iron barwith a soft-drink can stuck on the end.   Inkatha's statement said the police action was hurting chancesfor peace between black factions.   Police estimated the crowd at 6,000, but observers put thefigure at 8,000 to 10,000. It was an unusual show of Inkatha forcein Johannesburg, an ANC stronghold. Most of Inkatha's supportersare Zulus from Natal Province.   The police presence was light. Soldiers with automatic weaponsstood on some street corners but did not interfere, and officersreported no incidents.   Inkatha and the ANC both oppose apartheid but differ on tacticsto fight it. In addition to protesting police actions, the marchwas a show of support for Inkatha leader Mangosuthu Buthelezi inhis rivalry with the ANC leadership.   ``Mandela go away! Sisulu go away!'' the crowd chanted,referring to ANC leaders Nelson Mandela and Walter Sisulu.   Mandela, meanwhile, arrived in Tokyo on Saturday for his firstvisit to Japan. The visit was part of a world tour to lobby forcontinuing support for the anti-apartheid movement.   During his six-day visit, the 72-year-old deputy president ofthe African National Congress is scheduled to address a session ofJapan's Parliament and meet with Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu andother officials.</TEXT></DOC>
