(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said Tuesday he's ``earnedconsideration'' to run as the Democrats' vice presidentialcandidate, though he continued his presidential campaign one weekbefore the final primaries.   Jackson, campaigning in New Jersey for the state's June 7primary, also spoke of possibly going directly to the floor of theDemocratic National Convention in July to fight for platform planksor other issues he considers important.   On Tuesday, in what was billed as a ``major urban policyspeech,'' he also renewed his calls for equal rights and justice.   ``Making America better is our challenge. Invest in the people.Reinvest in America,'' he said.   On the subject of the vice presidency, he was asked whether hewould accept if he should receive an offer from Democraticfront-runner Michael Dukakis to be the Massachusetts governor'srunning mate.   Jackson's reply: ``I've earned consideration.''   Were he himself to win, he added, he would give the sameconsideration to Dukakis.   He declined to elaborate on his feelings about the No. 2 spot,saying only, ``I'll discuss that in more detail after June 7.''   Jackson said he and Dukakis must work together to defeat VicePresident George Bush, the Republican Party's all-but-certainnominee.   ``We need each other. We're keenly aware of that. Together, wemust use our combined strength to change the course,'' Jackson said.   The Democrats' own course, Jackson said, is one that he _ notDukakis _ has set with what he called his progressive campaigncentered on a call for ``jobs, peace and justice.''   Dukakis this week met with black Democrats, and later saidJackson would have a major role at the convention and in the fallcampaign.   ``If I put forth a vision, then reward me,'' Jackson said.   ``I do not foresee confrontation,'' Jackson said. ``We caneffectively negotiate on mutually respectful terms.''   Jackson said he expects the anchors of his campaign _ includingworkers' pay, reduced military spending and the war on drugs _ tobecome planks in the party's 1988 platform.   He said he has been given six seats on the platform committee,as has Dukakis by Democratic National Chairman Paul Kirk.   As the likely nominee, Dukakis would wield great power over theplatform. But Jackson said he, too, will help set the Democrats'agenda. ``We've set the tone for the country,'' he said.   If disputes occur, Jackson said, he and his supporters mightbypass the platform writers and take their issues to the fullconvention.   ``There's room to take one's case to the floor,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
