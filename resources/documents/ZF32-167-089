You'll find it on page 57 of the manual, plainand simple.andP;  (The effort that went into the documentation extends to acompanion booklet, &quot;The Innocent's Guide to Type.&quot; Maybe the world didn'tneed another graphic-design tutorial, but the examples and step-by-stepinstructions repay close study.) Installing the font metrics and screen fontfiles for Microsoft Word, Windows, WordPerfect, and LetterPerfect is a snap.andO;And when you print, you print fast, because the fonts are already in theprinter--where they belong.andM;Bitstream is currently bunmdling the $379 Type City base cartridge withtheDeli add-in card, so you get 41 fonts in eight type families and sizesthat range from 7 to 36 point (with one 60-point ringer: Old Dreadful No.andP;  7,which is a seriously hip symbol set.andP;  Three other $99 add-in cards areavailable: Skyscraper (headline faces), Central Park (Landscape fonts), andSoHo (sympols).andM;Type City is an easy place to visit--and you'll probably discover that youwant to liver there.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
