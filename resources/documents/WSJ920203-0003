Denison raised its asking price in order to recover morethan C$300 million (US$255.3 million) in undepreciated fixedassets at its Ontario uranium mining operation. The companyintends to close the mine this spring after its solecustomer, Ontario Hydro, terminated a long-term uraniumsupply agreement nearly 20 years earlier than planned.</LP><TEXT>   The dispute could be critical for financially troubledDenison, which has been selling off many of its assets toreduce debt. The company, which had a loss of C$19.7 millionin last year's third quarter, has said that its immediateobjective is &quot;to survive as a going concern.&quot;   Ontario Hydro said it filed a claim in the Ontario Courtof Justice seeking to clarify the terms of the supplyagreement, which guarantees Denison a price above its cost ofproduction. Ontario Hydro said it has paid Denison about C$60per pound of uranium in recent years. Over a 10-year period,this has meant paying some C$1 billion more than if theutility had bought uranium at market prices, it said.   Ontario Hydro, which is owned by the province, maintainsthat Denison's undepreciated assets represent a cost ofclosing the mine, which shouldn't be included in the uraniumprice.   &quot;We think Denison has totally misinterpreted the contract.They want to write off everything and call that a cost ofproduction,&quot; said Ted Bazeley, Ontario Hydro's manager ofnuclear fuel supply.   Denison is a mining concern based in Toronto. Denisonofficials wouldn't comment on the court action.</TEXT></DOC>
