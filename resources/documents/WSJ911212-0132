Gordon Crovitztortures logic and language. He suggests that as an assistantsecretary of state, Elliott Abrams was not obliged to beforthright in his answers to Congress, arguing at the sametime that Lawrence Walsh violated etiquette by not informingMr. Abrams fully of the progress of his investigation. I wasnot aware of any obligation of the prosecution to prepare thedefendant for all possible outcomes resulting from witnesses'statements, prior to formal discovery.   Though prevarication was accepted practice amongexecutive-branch officials during the Reagan years, languagemust retain some integrity. When Mr. Abrams stated, &quot;We havebeen kind of careful not to get closely involved with it,&quot; heknew that he was misrepresenting the facts, and has admittedto it. No amount of obfuscation and revision will allow Mr.Crovitz to define Mr. Abrams's statement as anything butmendacious.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Abrams's response to the question on third-country aidwas also clearly and unambiguously a lie. He had beendirectly involved in such solicitation, so to claim that hisanswer had some integrity because the solicitations were socomically mishandled is truly to grasp at straws.   In the matter of special prosecutor vs. executive branchinvestigative competence, let us not forget that Ed Meeseassumed responsibility for the original investigation. In thecourse of his management, the individuals targeted had theopportunity to destroy all evidence pertaining to the case.Surely Mr. Crovitz would not suggest that this is a standardby which &quot;experienced law-enforcement officials&quot; should bejudged. It is a continuing offense to the intellect that theperpetrators and their supporters hide behind faultyrecollection and legal technicalities while claiming to bemartyred.   As to the question of prosecutorial harassment, how is thecase of the &quot;Contreaganauts&quot; different from any othercriminal prosecution? Messrs. Abrams, Poindexter, North etal. can hardly claim any greater disadvantage than anyoneelse charged with an offense. If they cannot afford legalrepresentation, the law obliges that it be provided atgovernment expense. Every day, in every court in the land,people face criminal charges with considerable consequencesand do so with only court-provided counsel. It would be atribute to our democratic notions of equality, notions thatpeople like Messrs. North and Abrams were so anxious toexport, if some of our executive-branch officials weresubjected to the same legal perils the rest of us face.   Charles F. Albert   Haverhill, Mass.   ---   A liar, Ambrose Bierce once said, is a lawyer with aroving commission. He might well have had in mind ElliottAbrams and his career at the State Department.   Mr. Crovitz states that Mr. Abrams's &quot;`crime' was notbeing entirely frank during a congressional hearing. . . .&quot;This is unfair to Mr. Abrams, who during his tenure asassistant secretary of state for Inter-American Affairs,carried deceit to a level unique in the conduct of U.S.foreign policy.   When on Oct. 15, 1986, Rep. Michael Barnes held a hearingof the House Subcommittee on Inter-American Affairs, Itestified that based on the evidence there could be no doubtthat the aircraft shot down in Nicaragua was on an officialU.S. resupply mission.   I watched with disgust when, at the same hearing, Mr.Abrams testified that he was pleased to reiterate that &quot;theflight in which Mr. Hasenfus took part was a privateinitiative. It was not organized, directed or financed by theU.S. government.&quot;   Understand that Mr. Abrams and his colleagues had givenfull information on U.S. involvement in the Contra operationto everyone from the sultan of Brunei to Gen. Manuel Noriega.It was only Congress that could not be trusted with thetruth.   Robert E.
