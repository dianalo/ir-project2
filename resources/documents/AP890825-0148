Shaul Mishaniya was found after a huge search by helicopters andhundreds of soldiers. Officials said an Arab suspect capturedThursday led agents of the Shin Bet secret service to the well inthe tiny village of Abush near Tukarem. Israel TV said three allegedkidnappers are in custody.   Army officials said the well was about 20 to 23 feet deep, butthat Mishaniya's head was above water.   ``I am healthy, thank God, and thank you to the Israeli army andall the soldiers who helped me,'' Mishaniya said on Israel radio.   Mishaniya, 47, was the first Israeli civilian abducted in the20-month-old Palestinian uprising, stirring speculation that leadersof the revolt were stepping up the violence in their battle againstIsraeli occupation.   Israel television said security officials suspected Mishaniya'skidnapping was part of a hostage-bargaining operation.   It said Shin Bet apprehended one suspect hours after thekidnapping and described him as a wanted member of an undergroundPalestinian group in Abush.   However, officials also said they were investigating possiblecriminal motives for the kidnapping.   ``The motive is not known. The investigation is looking intowhether it is political or criminal or both,'' said Col. RenaanGissin, deputy military spokesman.   Few Israelis now venture to the West Bank because of theuprising. Mishaniya reportedly there went to collect debts owed himby Arabs. News reports said he argued with an Arab merchant beforehe was grabbed Wednesday night by masked men carrying knives.   Mishaniya said on TV he was inside an Arab-owned taxi ``whenseveral youths came running. One sat next to me on the front seat,holding a big screwdriver in his hand.''   He said the abductors blinfolded him and led him to hills wherethey walked for about three hours. The men ``tried to put me on adonkey, saying: `You are an old man, it's not worth walking,' but... I thought they wanted me to fall down and die.''   Mishaniya said the kidnappers then drove him blindfolded in a carand finally put him in the well.   At least 548 Palestinians have died in clashes with soldiers orIsraeli civilians during the uprising, which began in December 1987in lands taken by Israel from Jordan and Egypt in the 1967 MiddleWast war. Fellow Arabs killed 97 others as collaborators.Thirty-eight Israelis also died in the violence.   In the Gaza Strip on Friday, the army demolished three houses andpartly destroyed a fourth of Palestinians accused of killing allegedcollaborators or playing a role in the uprising, the army said.   The army has torn down more than 200 houses in the occupied landsduring the uprising, despite complaints by the United State andhuman rights groups that destroying homes amounts to collectivepunishment.   The Jerusalem Post quoted army sources as saying a Palestinianteen-ager whose body was found Tuesday in a West Bank refugee campwas killed by Israeli security forces the night before. An armyspokeswoman could not confirm the report.   Also Friday, the army permanently barred Palestinian writerMutawakil Taha from entering Israel, an army spokesman said.   Taha, head of the West Bank Writers Association, has beenrepeatedly accused of fostering the uprising.</TEXT></DOC>
