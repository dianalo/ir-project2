The other would be Arab, in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The PLOalso claims East Jerusalem, which the Israelis have annexed, as its capital.Palestinians have demanded that any negotiations with Israel take place withinthe framework of an international peace conference. Both the Israelis and theUnited States reject this approach.; Q Who represents the Palestinians?; A Inpublic opinion polls, Palestinians have said overwhelmingly that they arerepresented by the PLO, an umbrella group formed in 1964 that includes anumber of organizations with different ideologies.; Q What is Israel's stand?Why does it refuse to negotiate with the PLO?; A Israeli Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir, a member of Israel's right-wing Likud party, has statedrepeatedly that he will not concede any territory to the Arab states orPalestinians or negotiate with the Palestine Liberation Organization. Instead,he has proposed a plan to hold elections in the occupied territories toproduce a slate of non-PLO Palestinians to negotiate with Israel about limitedself-rule. His plan also calls for negotiations with the surrounding Arabnations to end the state of war and the Arab boycott of Israel.;    Both Likudand the more centrist Labor Party have refused to negotiate with the PLObecause they claim it is a terrorist organization and because they do notaccept the idea of a Palestinian state alongside Israel, which is the PLO'scentral demand.; Q How has the United Nations attempted to solve thisproblem?; A The U.N. Security Council has considered dozens of resolutions onthe Israeli-Palestinian dispute, but until recently the United States hasvetoed those that are critical of Israel. The resolutions most cited indiscussions of the Palestine question are 242 and 338, which are supported bythe United States and call on Israel to give up occupied territory in returnfor recognition of Israel's right to exist. The PLO has accepted theresolutions. Israel also accepted them, but said later that its acceptance didnot mean that it had to return all the territory.; Q What role has the UnitedStates played in this crisis?; A The United States has been the major arms andforeign aid supplier to Israel since 1967. It has been involved in manynegotiations aimed at achieving some kind of peace agreement between Israel,its Arab neighbors and the Palestinians. So far, only one -- the 1979 peacetreaty between Israel and Egypt negotiated by former President Carter -- hassucceeded. Israel returned the Sinai Peninsula to Egypt in return forrecognition. Subsequent talks on the Gaza Strip and West Bank broke off.;   The agreement called for negotiations between Egypt, Jordan and Israel on thefate of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. But Palestinians complainedthat it said nothing of Palestinian self-determination, speaking instead of afive-year period of &quot;autonomy&quot; that would leave control of the occupied WestBank and Gaza Strip -- including its resources and political structures -- inthe hands of the Israelis. The talks between the Egyptians and the Israeliseventually broke down, with the Egyptians accusing the Israelis of negotiatingin bad faith.; Q Why hasn't James Baker been willing to meet with the PLO onhis current Middle East trip?:; A For years, U.S. officials refused to speakpublicly with the organization's representatives. That changed briefly in Dec.1988, after PLO leader Yasser Arafat publicly stated that the PLO wasrenouncing terrorism and had accepted Israel's right to exist. But in May1990, a PLO faction attempted to attack Israel and Arafat refused to condemnit. The United States broke off the dialogue in June 1990, saying theorganization had broken its pledge not to engage in terrorism.;    However,the United States continues to state that Israel must trade occupied land forpeace with the Palestinians and the Arab world. And on Tuesday, Baker met withseveral Palestinian leaders who live in the Israeli-occupied West Bank andGaza Strip and have strong ties to the PLO.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Mercury News Staff Report  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910313  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  733  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday March 13, 199100073157,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
