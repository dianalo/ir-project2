An Episcopal minister, the Rev. Donald Lewis of San Marino,Calif., identified the two as Kathleene Hoy and Mary Parmenter ofPasadena, Calif. He claimed their detention was a part of increasedharassment of U.S. ecumenical workers by Salvadoran authorities inrecent months.   The two California women were detained ``for entering restrictedareas without authorization,'' said agent Orlando Ramirez of theTreasury Police, whose jurisdiction includes investigations ofcustoms and immigration violations.   Ramirez said they were apprehended at the Copapayo camp nearSuchitoto, about 25 miles northwest of San Salvador. Guerrillasfrequently carry out operations in the area.   He said the women, along with seven Salvadorans, were detainedThursday morning and brought to the capital. The two U.S. citizenswere released into the custody of U.S. Vice Consul Mark Schallafter several hours of questioning, he said.   U.S Embassy spokesman Jacob Gillespie said the Privacy Actprevented him from confirming the women's names or details of theincident. But he agreed with the Treasury Police report that twoAmerican women were detained and later released.   Lewis, chairman of a diocesan task force for Salvadoranresettlement, said he was informed of the detention by telephone bya U.S. Embassy official in San Salvador.   He said the military has been harassing Americans providinghumanitarian assistance in El Salvador since about 20,000Salvadoran refugees in Honduras decided to return to their homelandlast fall.   ``Since then, the government nervousness and harassment ofecumenical workers has increased ... Our concern is that this kindof caseworker harassment has happened to others who are strictlydown there for humanitarian reasons,'' he said.   Guerillas from five leftist groups have been fighting since 1980to overthrow the U.S.-backed government.</TEXT></DOC>
