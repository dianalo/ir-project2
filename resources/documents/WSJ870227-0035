Young andamp; Co.'s merger overtures, said more than one-third of its shareholders agreed to vote as a bloc in the event of a takeover bid.    The 33.6% stake in Sorg, a financial printing concern, is held by members of the Sorg family. Gilbert Sorg, who holds a 1.7% stake, is the company's chairman.    Roy A. Cardia, Sorg's president and chief executive officer, said the company has &quot;no interest&quot; in a merger with Young. He added that Sorg hasn't been contacted by officials of Service Resources Corp., Young's parent company, regarding a merger proposal.    &quot;All I know is what I've read in the newspapers,&quot; Mr. Cardia said.    As reported earlier this week, Young and an investor group said they acquired 18% of the common shares of Sorg and planned to seek the rest, for an undisclosed price. Young, which is also a financial printing company, and SDI Limited Partnership, New York, hold 403,600 of Sorg's approximately 2.2 million shares outstanding.    In American Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Sorg closed at $22.625, down 37.5 cents. Based on yesterday's closing price, the value of Sorg shares that aren't owned by the Young group is about $42 million.    Service Resources officials couldn't be reached for comment on Sorg's announcement, which was made after the market closed yesterday. The company, which provides back-office services for law firms, investment banks and other companies, has said it plans to attempt to negotiate a merger with Sorg on a friendly basis. However, it would consider a hostile takeover if necessary.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday, Service Resources closed at $19.125, down 12.5 cents.    Late last year, Young failed in a bid to acquire Pandick Inc., also a financial printer, for $28 a share, or $305 million. </TEXT></DOC>
