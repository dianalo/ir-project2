This is in contrast to several other modalitiesin current use in the field of diagnostic imaging. Some of these newermodalities, such as computerized tomography (CT), offer a better resolutionof the anatomy of the organ being examined. This has caused physiciansto drift away from certain nuclear medicine tests, specifically thosethat focus primarily on the anatomy. When CT scanning is available, forinstance, it is no longer advisable to perform a scintigraphic brainscan in search of metastasis;CT scanning is more accurate overall andmore likely than a nuclear study to result in a specific diagnosis. Incertain cases of diffuse cortical infections like herpes encephalitis,however, a scintiscan is still superior to a CT scan. Today's practiceof nuclear medicine in gynecologic oncology may be divided into the threecategories - (1) time-tested function-oriented scintiscans, (2) innovationsof established nuclear tests, and (3) newer pathophysiological scintistudies.The author discusses here, briefly, each of these categories, givingthree examples of each.</TEXT></DOC>
