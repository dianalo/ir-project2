Solutions for all these categories of developers are beingprepared by vendors, all put into the 'real-time Unix' category.andO;Most vendors develop an operating system kernel or real-timeexecutive from scratch or modify an existing real-time kernel, butkernels do not provide higher-level services.andP;  Various approachesto real-time Unix design and use of the Posix standard arediscussed.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     UNIXReal-Time SystemsSoftware DesignSystem DesignMethodsSoftware PublishersComparisonUser Needs.andO;Feature:   illustrationchart.andO;Caption:   Unix interprocess communication techniques.
