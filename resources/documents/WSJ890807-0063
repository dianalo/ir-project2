Jacoby, a senior vice president in charge of the insurance products group, resigned last week. The insurer said that it was a personnel matter. Equitable declined to comment further.    People close to the company said Mr. Jacoby had repeatedly clashed with his boss, Jeff R. Hart, an executive vice president in charge of products, pension management and joint ventures. Messrs. Jacoby and Hart couldn't be reached for comment.    Mr. Jacoby, 45 years old, had been named to this post last April when the company consolidated responsibility for the development and management of Equitable's life, health, annuity and pension products in this position. The move was part of a major home-office reorganization, the second in the past two years. Last spring, the company also created a marketing division to handle marketing, merchandising and training.    Equitable hasn't named anyone to fill Mr. Jacoby's post. He will remain with the company through the end of the year. </TEXT></DOC>
