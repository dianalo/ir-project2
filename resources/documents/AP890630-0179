The commission denied challenges by ATandamp;T competitors and thestate of Alaska to a new pricing method that goes into effectSaturday.   The new plan, which the FCC adopted in March following two yearsof debate, imposes caps on how much ATandamp;T can charge. Since the1960s, the FCC has regulated how much ATandamp;T could earn above itscosts.   The FCC, which has said the new ``price cap'' plan could savetelephone users $900 million over four years, on Friday rejectedassertions by the challengers that ATandamp;T had failed to provide enoughevidence to justify its new pricing schedule and that ATandamp;T hadcalculated certain rates improperly.   The challengers wanted the FCC to fully investigate the inauguralprice cap plan, which ATandamp;T claims will lower prices $140 millionimmediately _ $100 million for residential customers.   ATandamp;T said it will lower charges for its basic long-distancerates, its Reach Out America service and for international calling.   One of the challengers, the Competitive TelecommunicationsAssociation (Comptel), claimed ATandamp;T was achieving the $140 millioncut, not by price caps but by ``flowing through'' to its customerspreviously ordered FCC price cuts.   Under the old rate-of-return regulatory system, ATandamp;T'slong-distance rates have dropped 38 percent since 1984. But much ofthat decrease has resulted from higher prices consumers have beenpaying to connect to local telephone networks.   With consumers paying more, long-distance companies have paidless to the local telephone networks, and the FCC has forced ATandamp;T topass along _ flow through _ those savings to its long-distancecustomers.   In rejecting the challenges Friday, the commission said ATandamp;T hadcomplied with its April price cap order in setting the new rates andit was not flowing through savings.   The commission said it found some ``deficiencies'' in ATandamp;Tdocuments supporting its new prices but that the flaws were ``not soserious as to warrant investigation.''   ``The tariff will therefore not be set for investigation,'' saidGerald Brock, chief of the commission's common carrier bureau.   Besides Comptel the challengers were Alascom Inc., AllnetCommunications Services Inc., US Sprint Communications Co. and theNational Telecommunications Network. The state of Alaska had joinedAlascom in challenging the rates for service to Alaska.   Earlier in the week the commission also rejected challenges toprice caps filed by the Puerto Rico Telephone Co. and La TelefonicaLarga Distancia, a Puerto Rican long-distance company. Thecommission had denied the Puerto Rican companies' claims that pricecaps were not in the public interest.   The price cap plan allows ATandamp;T, which in 1988 controlled 68percent of the U.S. long-distance market, to raise rates 3percentage points less than the rate of inflation in threecategories of service: residential and small business; 800 calls;and other business services, mainly for large customers.   ATandamp;T can raise or lower rates up to 5 percent for individualservices within these categories by giving 14 days notice to theFCC, which will presume the changes to be lawful. The burden ofproof then would be on challengers to prove the changes were illegal.   If rate changes fall outside the price cap parameters, then theFCC will investigate.   The FCC has said the plan is intended to give ATandamp;T an incentiveto cut costs.   The commission also has proposed to impose price caps on theseven Bell regional phone companies beginning in July 1990.</TEXT></DOC>
