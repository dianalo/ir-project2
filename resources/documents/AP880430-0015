On Thursday, Algerian Ambassador Mohammed Sahnoun said thehijackers had left Algeria without getting what they wanted andwithout obtaining any concessions for freeing the 31 remainingpassengers.   But two U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Friday thehijackers had been promised that five or six of the 17 prisonersheld in Kuwait for bomb attacks on the U.S. and French embassies in1983 would be released early.   However, the prisoners have not been released and the gunmen,who had been promised safe passage, remain in Algeria, theofficials said on condition of anonymity.   According to this account of the negotiations, Algerianintermediaries faithfully conveyed Kuwait's promise to thehijackers. But the officials said Kuwait, which has a firm policyof not yielding to terrorism, may not have had any intention ofletting the prisoners go in the first place.   ``They have stood so fast for so long, they probably had nointention of letting them go early,'' one of the officials said.   The five-year prison terms of three of the 17 Shiite Moslems aredue to expire at the end of the year.   During the long ordeal, the United States repeatedly urgedKuwait publicly and privately not to yield to the hijackers. TheReagan administration was not aware of the terms to end the siegebecause they were worked out through Algerian intermediaries, theofficials said.   The account was provided by Algeria, which has played a role inresolving several hijackings, in diplomatic contacts with theUnited States in the aftermath of the hijacking.   Sahnoun also said that while his government would have liked toapprehend the hijackers, such a move would have damaged itscredibility as a mediator in international crises such as attemptsto obtain the release of the eight American hostages in Lebanon.   Sahnoun, addressing reporters at the National Press Club here,said the hijackers ``went back without achieving anything.''   The Kuwaiti press agency also said on April 20 that thehijackers _ there were believed to be eight or nine _ had probablybeen flown to Lebanon or Iran.   But the U.S. officials told The Associated Press the gunmen hadremained in Algeria.   Another U.S. official, interviewed separately, said Syria hadassured the United States that despite reports to the contrary, thehijackers had not been flown from Algeria to Damascus. Reports fromAlgiers had said the terrorists were flown to Damascus, from wherethey made their way by land to Lebanon.   The State Department has identified one of the hijackers asHassan Izz-al-Din and said he might have been involved in thekilling of Navy diver Robert Stethem in the hijacking of a TWAjetliner in 1985.   He was charged by a federal grand jury in seizing the plane.   This raises a possibility of a U.S. request for extradition.Also, Secretary of State George P. Shultz has said one of thepassengers may have had dual U.S. citizenship.   He condemned the hijackers last week as murderers.   The plane, a Boeing 747 with 112 passengers and crew members,was hijacked April 5 on a flight from Thailand to Kuwait and spentseveral days in Meshed, Iran, and Larnaca, Cyprus, before flying toAlgiers.   Two Kuwaiti passengers were killed and their bodies dumped fromthe plane while it was in Cyprus.   The hijackers' principal demand was the release of the 17prisoners in Kuwait. The freed hostages included three members ofthe Kuwaiti royal family.</TEXT></DOC>
