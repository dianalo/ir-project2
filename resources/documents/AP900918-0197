Her firstpublished novel was the first one she ever wrote.   It's not supposed to happen that way. She should have attemptedto write six or seven novels, supported herself by moonlighting asa bank clerk or editing at a publishing house, and finally made itaround age 40.   Instead, Shapiro is just 25 and wrote ``Playing With Fire''(Doubleday, $17.95) in a small room at the Dakota in Manhattan, oneof the city's most exclusive apartment houses, whose residentsinclude Yoko Ono, Carly Simon and Lauren Bacall.   ``You knock on wood a lot,'' Shapiro said. ``But in some ways Ifeel like I've paid my dues. I have written for many, many years.I've just never tried to get anything published. That's one of thegreat ironies.''   ``Playing With Fire,'' a coming-of-age story set in the East,quickly became a mystery for Doubleday. Press releases state thepublishers couldn't decide whether the novel was commercial orliterary.   Shapiro worked on it like any other fiction writer, startingwith characters based on real people and gradually using more ofher imagination, but the packaging is as slick as any fashionmagazine.   A model's seductive stare and bare leg are visible on the front,and a carefully coiffed Shapiro is on the back, her blond hairlayered rather than straight and brushed back as she appears inperson.   ``What do you think? Is that picture going to end up in SpyMagazine or what?'' laughed Shapiro, looking at a copy of the book.   ``I think that is part of selling the book,'' she added.``There's a funny story with this book. There's a picture on thespine of the book that shows the model's whole body. That wasoriginally the front. I was really grateful they changed it becauseshe looked like me.   ``In some circles `commercial' can mean derogatory. In othercircles it can mean it sells a lot of books. I just knew that ifthis got published, I would be the happiest girl in the worldforever.''   Shapiro's real life is a mix of the literary and the commercial- or commercials. Born in New York City and raised in an OrthodoxJewish household, she had tried short stories in high school, butwas too scared to let anyone see them. She attended Sarah LawrenceCollege hoping to develop her writing skills, but became an actressinstead.   ``I met this friend of my family, who was a commercialproducer,'' she recalled. ``I did start doing commercials - thekind of things you need to do to get in the actor's union. I kindof fell into it. The years I was acting I thought that I wanted todo serious work but I didn't have a facility.''   Shapiro's credits included spots for candy bars, soda, a boardgame and gasoline - not exactly the Iowa Writers Workshop. KirkDouglas may be able to write novels, but Shapiro insists acting isthe worst kind of preparation for being an author.   ``They're opposites,'' she said. ``A friend of mine said thatwriters write because they don't want to be heard saying what theysay. The method of acting I was studying had everything to do withthe person, with their history, plotting out their life.   ``It's very autobiographical, while as a writer you try to getfurther away from your own life.''   Shapiro got back to writing and eventually showed some of herwork to an agent, Esther Newberg, who got her a deal at Doubleday.The book was sold in February 1989 (film rights have been acquiredby a pair of independent producers), and Shapiro revied it overthe summer.   ``Playing With Fire'' is narrated by Lucy Greenberg, the onlychild of a prominent New York City family. She attends SmithCollege and rooms with the beautiful and mysterious Carolyn Ward.They soon begin a passionate affair which becomes even morecomplicated when Lucy starts seeing Carolyn's wealthy stepfather.   Shapiro changed the novel considerably with each draft, takingcharacters once based on herself and friends and adding details shewould have never wished or imagined otherwise.   ``Doubleday never said do this or do that. We would sit atbreakfast and talk for hours about the characters and I'd go homeand work on them,'' she explained. ``We'd have all these corporatebreakfasts and talk about Lucy and Carolyn, and people would bereally interested.''   ``Playing With Fire'' was a coming-of-age experience for Shapiroas well. Writing the book aged her five years, she says, andpublicizing it added five more. She's now at work on a secondnovel, quickly gathering material for a box that will someday befilled with evidence of dues even the luckiest writer has to pay.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, Sept. 28-30</NOTE><TEXT/></DOC>
