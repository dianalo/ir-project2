But though the giant defense contractor's name is on thedoor, this isn't a missile command center or aerospace lab.It's where Lockheed manages parking-ticket collection for LosAngeles, processing fines and handling citizen complaints.The red alert signifies nothing more dangerous than that anirate scofflaw has become too long-winded, and the phoneoperator needs reinforcement.</LP><TEXT>   At another site nearby, the job Lockheed does for LosAngeles is equally down-to-earth: keeping track ofcourt-ordered child-support payments.   And so it goes in the defense industry, as companies seeknew opportunities now that the Cold War's &quot;long drawn-outdread is over,&quot; as President Bush put it in his State of theUnion address. In a recent 148-company survey co-sponsored bythe Winbridge Group, a Cambridge, Mass., consulting firm,more than half said they have attempted to commercializetheir defense technologies, and more than three-quartersenvision such efforts in the future.   &quot;We're all looking for ways to take swords and turn theminto plowshares,&quot; says Bob Napier, head of technologydevelopment at Lockheed Information Management Services Co.,the unit that oversees the two Los Angeles facilities andscores of similar ones around the country.   Lockheed Corp., which as the nation's sixth-largestdefense contractor derives about 70% of its $10 billion inannual revenue from the Pentagon, began branching out as soonas the defense budget showed signs of flattening in themid-1980s. It now has 21,000 of its 72,000 employees assignedto civilian projects. In 1984, it acquired Datacom SystemsCorp., which already ran parking-ticket collection bureaus insome large cities.   Today, Lockheed is also trying to help the Postal Servicesort mail more efficiently, perform environmental cleanupwork and build &quot;smart highways&quot; capable of funneling trafficefficiently through toll plazas and routinghazardous-material shipments. That's in addition to moretraditional commercial work such as making telecommunicationssatellites, overhauling commercial airliners and runningurban airports as private enterprises. In announcing lastweek a preliminary agreement with Martin Marietta Corp. tojointly buy and operate the big aerospace operations ofDallas-based LTV Corp., Lockheed Chairman Daniel Tellep notedthe $400 million of tail sections that LTV makes annually forjetliners, a business Lockheed has long sought to enter.   And just two weeks ago, in what may be the ultimatediversification move for a weapons maker, Lockheed joinedOlin Corp. and Babcock andamp; Wilcox Co. to form a venture with aname befitting the times: International Disarmament Corp. Itsmission is to help dismantle nuclear warheads of the U.S. andthe former Soviet Union.   In nearly all these cases, Lockheed hopes to capitalize ongovernments' growing tendency to ask for private contractors'help. Many state, local and federal officials believe that byrelying more on outsiders, they can cut costs and better dealwith budget shortfalls.   Yet, as Lockheed's experience also shows, diversificationcan be a rocky road for a huge arms producer. The Calabasas,Calif., company, which has long engaged in bruising lobbyingbattles on Capitol Hill, has had to learn -- the hard way --about the rough-and-tumble world of local politics. It hasbeen caught up in a bribery scandal in New York City andfaced charges of influence-peddling in Los Angeles inconnection with its parking-ticket operations. And for themoment at least, many of its non-defense divisions remainsmall and unprofitable.   Some smaller companies already have metamorphosed. In the1970s, for example, a Bloomfield, Conn., company called KamanCorp. applied the vibration-control techniques used forhelicopters to making guitars. Frisby Airborne Hydraulics, aFreeport, N.Y., company that builds aircraft components, did90% of its business with the Pentagon in the early 1980s, andnow its sales are 75% commercial.   Big corporations, though, tend to be wary of wholesalemakeovers. Grumman Corp. Chairman Renso Caporali says thatwhile his company &quot;would be delighted if we were 50%commercial,&quot; he fears throwing money into a &quot;sinkhole.&quot;Lockheed itself, during past defense downturns, poured fundsinto such costly and ultimately unrewarding projects as arotating oil-spill cleanup drum and a &quot;momentum wheel&quot; thatwas supposed to power the San Francisco trolley system.   For some in the defense industry, the lessons ofill-conceived diversification are captured in a McKinsey andamp;Co. study prepared for General Dynamics Corp., which hassworn off commercial work entirely. The report's findings:Some 80% of defense contractors' non-defense acquisitionshave flopped.   &quot;The failed attempts,&quot; economist Murray Weidenbaum ofWashington University in St. Louis noted in a speech lastyear, &quot;range from canoes to computers to coffins.&quot;   Besides fears of being twice-burned, companies move slowlyto diversify because the proposed military budget, even afterthe cutbacks called for by President Bush, remains huge:about $280 billion in fiscal 1993. In the mid-1990s, Lockheedexpects defense to still account for 60% of its business.Perhaps foremost among the array of weapons it makes is theF-22 advanced jet fighter, a multibillion-dollar program thatwill go forward under the Pentagon's latest spending plan.   Nonetheless, defense companies are trying to find new,peaceful fields in which to grow. TRW Inc. is acceleratingthe movement of technology from its space and defense sectorinto the automotive market. Westinghouse Electric Corp. hasused its expertise in defense to pursue opportunities indrug-interdiction, post-office automation and residentialsecurity services. Hughes Aircraft Co. is seeking to changeits military-commercial mix to 50-50 from 70-30 by the end ofthe decade. And Rockwell International Corp., once thenation's second-largest military supplier, already hasslashed defense to about 25% of revenue by making newspaperprinting presses, factory-automation gear and auto parts.   But perhaps no contractor illustrates the industry'suneasy search for new markets as well as Lockheed. Althoughenthusiastic, senior managers profess to be proceedingcautiously. They say they won't hesitate to pull back fromany project that isn't panning out. &quot;We're not betting thecompany&quot; on any new initiative, Mr. Tellep says. &quot;These aremeasured investments.&quot;   Lockheed's approach to identifying a prospectivenon-defense business sounds simple: It must be in a growingmarket not saturated with competition, must promise a goodrate of return and must relate in some way to what thecompany can do already.   Tracking parking-meter violators and deadbeat dads seems,at first, a stretch for an outfit that built F-117 Stealthfighters and Trident missiles. But Lockheed's officials notethat most of its tasks, new and old, share a commondenominator: processing a lot of information quickly. &quot;Whatwe really understand is how to manage complicated systems,&quot;explains Don Jones, who runs many of Lockheed's nondefenselines. The high-tech approach required on defense work canprovide a competitive edge over rivals, the company contends.   &quot;The tools we have at our disposal are dazzling,&quot; saysJohn Brophy, president of Lockheed Information Management.Artificial-intelligence software Lockheed developed for the&quot;Star Wars&quot; missile shield is now being used to helpofficials sift through rapidly changing child-supportregulations and to manage parking systems. Recently, missileengineers schooled in sophisticated computer work werebrought in to help prepare a bid for a child-support-servicescontract.   Lockheed's parking-ticket division is hooked into anunderground data center in Tarrytown, N.Y., that links 50U.S. motor-vehicle departments. The center stores 75 billioncharacters of information and handles millions oftransactions a day with an average response time of 1.5seconds. &quot;It's not a nanosecond like it is in a spaceprogram,&quot; Mr. Brophy says, &quot;but it's about as good as it getson this planet.&quot;   Lockheed also says its non-defense operations benefit fromits military culture, which requires it to stick close to acustomer long after a product is delivered. Just as Lockheedemployees stand side by side with Pentagon personnel onflight lines around the world, the company'sinformation-services business helps to operate and manage thehardware and software it supplies. &quot;Most of the companiesLockheed competes against have only pieces of the puzzle,&quot;says Rand Garbacz, a Braxton Associates consultant workingfor Lockheed.   Adopting a defense contractor's style in commercialenterprises has brought Lockheed some criticism. For example,the company has hired a slew of former public officialsfamiliar with managing municipal services, a tacticresembling the so-called revolving door through whichofficials pass from the Pentagon to the executive suite.Lockheed Information Management has brought in 100 people itcalls &quot;subject-matter experts&quot; -- people who, in many cases,have learned the ropes by working for the very cities nowputting out bids.   Such tactics, critics say, may give Lockheed undueinfluence with government officials. Last year, as thecompany sought to renew its parking-ticket contract in LosAngeles, rivals questioned whether they were getting a fairshot at it.   &quot;They win some deals that maybe they don't deserve,&quot;charges Bill Herbert, general manager of Tixon Corp., aDetroit company that contends it underbid Lockheed by 18% onthe Los Angeles contract and still didn't get the business.He says that Lockheed's deep pockets enable it to &quot;hire thebest lobbyists&quot; and that its close contacts with cityofficials create a situation in which there's &quot;not always alevel playing field.&quot;   Alfonso Izzi, president of Computil Corp., has also runinto the Lockheed machine. In San Jose, Calif., Computil heldthe parking-ticket business -- until Lockheed hired away thecity official in charge of the contract. &quot;Next thing I know,we lose out to Lockheed,&quot; Mr. Izzi says. &quot;I can't say it'sillegal,&quot; he says, but Lockheed &quot;has an extremely effectivepolitical network across the country.&quot;   Mr. Brophy dismisses his rivals' comments as &quot;sour grapes&quot;and says the Lockheed operations are &quot;scrupulously clean.When you win 90% of the contracts that you bid on, you'recontroversial.&quot;   There is, however, a price paid for such bare-knucklecompetition. Before Lockheed won the $49 million, five-yearjob in Los Angeles, word was spread that two companyemployees had been questioned by the Federal Bureau ofInvestigation.   The FBI probe attracted particular attention because, in1986, Lockheed's parking-ticket business had been caught upin a corruption scandal in New York. One former city officialand a local Democratic leader were convicted of makingpayoffs to obtain business for the Lockheed unit, and aformer president of the unit testified that he had authorizedbribes.   The company, though not charged with any crime, lost itscontract in New York City and dismissed several executives.   &quot;Lockheed got a taste of local politics, and it was suretough,&quot; says Mr. Brophy, himself a former parking official inWashington. But he says Lockheed was informed by theauthorities that the FBI in Los Angeles never was actuallyinvestigating the company. He dismisses the controversysurrounding the FBI activity as &quot;nonsense spread bycompetitors.&quot;   The results that Lockheed has delivered to municipalitiesspeak for themselves, the company and some of its clientssay. In the past five years, total annual revenue fromparking tickets in Los Angeles has climbed to about $105million from $20 million. Some of that increase reflectssteeper fines and more police enforcement. But all in all,&quot;we're very pleased&quot; with Lockheed's work, says Bob Yates,this city's parking administrator. &quot;Their system has provento be very effective.'   Before the company took over parking-ticket collectionhere in 1989, the city ran the system itself. The result wasbags of unopened mail and a bureaucracy so leery of beingoverwhelmed by public inquiries that a phone number tocontact parking officials wasn't included on tickets.   Now, things go much more smoothly. Here in the smalldowntown office where the Lockheed parking-ticket business isbased, about 40 employees daily handle thousands of calls andletters from citizens, while the supervisor monitors hiscomputer screen to keep abreast of how things are moving. Inanother area, automated machines cull an average of 12,000parking tickets each day. The citations are scanned, loggedand microfilmed, and the enclosed checks endorsed, all inseconds. Before Lockheed arrived, it was all done by hand.   Even here, the Lockheed legacy isn't forgotten. On thewalls of the parking-ticket operation hang posters of thecompany's jet fighters. And Matthew Silverman, who runs theoffice, jokes that he is busy trying to sell city officialson a new concept: a &quot;stealth hook&quot; that would pull illegallyparked cars right off the street.</TEXT></DOC>
