The study was based onan actual FPV case (Balmoral) and a comparison with a drilling rig (Vinni)built concurrently at the GVA yard. The FPV's higher cost is explainedonly in part by its greater size, weight, and complexity; other factorsinclude higher quality requirements, certain project administration methods,and the learning costs associated with the Balmoral being the first FPVof its kind. In all these areas a subsequent FPV project could show savings- the scale of these depending on how far the experience gained overBalmoral could be applied in practice. All in all, for a comparable FPV,a cost reduction of up to 20% could be achievable.</TEXT></DOC>
