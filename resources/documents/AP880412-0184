WILSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Premier-designate Ciriaco De Mita received finalapproval from coalition members Tuesday to form Italy's 48thpost-World War II government and said he would present his Cabinetlist to the president.   The Christian Democrat leader told reporters, ``All the problemsare resolved'' in negotiations to form another five-partygovernment.   De Mita, 60, indicated he would go to the Quirinal Palace onWednesday to present his list of Cabinet ministers to PresidentFrancesco Cossiga, thus formally ending the monthlong governmentcrisis.   The coalition is to be made up of the same parties that havegoverned off and on since 1981: the Christian Democrats,Socialists, Social Democrats, Republicans and Liberals.   Leaders of the parties gave their final endorsement of De Mita'splan on Tuesday.   Crucial support came from the Socialists, the second-largestparty in the coalition and a frequent critic of the dominantChristian Democrats.   Giovanni Di Michelis, a Socialist representative, said the partywill participate in a ``loyal and constructive way.''   But the top Socialist leader, former Premier Bettino Craxi,predicted rough going for the new government.   He was asked if De Mita's government could last through the endof the legislative term in 1992 and replied, ``It would be amiracle.''   Craxi said the new coalition was based on the same foundation asthat led by Premier Giovanni Goria, a Christian Democrat whoresigned on March 11 after eight turbulent months in office.   Goria said he would not join the new government as a minister.   Christian Democrat Giulio Andreotti is expected to remain asforeign minister and Liberal Valerio Zanone as defense minister.   After presenting his Cabinet list to Cossiga, De Mita will seeka confidence vote in Parliament where the coalition holds acomfortable majority in both houses. The vote is expected next week.   De Mita cleared the final hurdle when the parties agreed onproposed anti-trust legislation for the Italian media. Under theaccord, no individual or group can own or control both a newspaperand a television network.   If the legislation is passed, private television magnate SilvioBerlusconi will have to give up his Milan newspaper Il Giornale,while the Fiat automaking company will have to drop plans to expandinto television.   Fiat owns the newspaper La Stampa of Turin and controls theRizzoli publishing group that includes the Corriere Della Seranewspaper of Milan and the sports daily Gazzetta dello Sport.   The Socialists had sought to gain equal management control ofthe state-run RAI television network, headed by a ChristianDemocrat, but that was rejected by De Mita.   On the issue of nuclear power, the parties put off a finaldecision on the fate of the unfinished nuclear plant at Montalto diCastro near Rome. The Socialists had insisted the plant beconverted to another form of energy production. The ChristianDemocrats favor completing the nuclear station.</TEXT></DOC>
