In the federal-court suit, ITT's Hartford insurance units charge that their portfolios were hurt because RJR didn't disclose that it was considering a leveraged buy-out when it sold them bonds in April.    ITT, an ardent critic of management-led buy-outs, also vowed yesterday not to make any new investments in leveraged buy-out funds.    Last April, two of ITT's Hartford insurance units bought $25 million out of a $300 million public bond offering by RJR, the big food and tobacco company. ITT's suit says the prospectus &quot;failed to disclose that RJR's senior management . . . was considering fundamental and major changes&quot; that would jeopardize the bonds' rating &quot;and decrease their price.&quot;    After RJR announced Oct. 20 that a management group was considering a $17.6 billion buy-out, prices of RJR bonds, and corporate debt issues generally, fell sharply. The old debt suddenly seemed riskier in view of the mountain of additional debt needed for buy-outs.    Hartford's paper losses on its RJR bonds currently are estimated at about $1.4 million, compared with the insurer's total bond portfolio of some $15 billion. But beyond the attempt to recover its RJR bond investment is a broader attempt by ITT and its chairman, Rand V. Araskog, to create a corporate rebellion against management-led buy-outs, most of which Mr. Araskog thinks are &quot;unethical.&quot;    In an interview yesterday, Mr. Araskog said he has asked trustees of the ITT and Hartford pension funds not to make further investments in leveraged buy-out funds. ITT will decide whether to renew its current investments with LBO sponsors when proceeds from those funds are distributed over the next several years.    An RJR spokesman said the company doesn't comment on pending litigation.    Mr. Araskog had said earlier that ITT, which has $30 million invested in an LBO fund of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., would try to withdraw from the fund if KKR proceeded with a hostile attempt to take over RJR. ITT's lawyers later determined that the company couldn't withdraw. But by then RJR's board said it was putting the company up for bids, making all offers friendly.    As a result, Mr. Araskog said yesterday, he's now &quot;certainly not opposed to (KKR) bidding or using our money&quot; as part of an offer.    An RJR board committee has set Friday as the deadline for bids, which are expected from KKR and a separate management-led group working with the investment banking firm of Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. A third group, led by the leveraged buy-out firm of Forstmann Little, said yesterday it wouldn't submit a bid.    ITT's suit reflects the growing ferment among bondholders, who have been demanding far greater price protection from debt issuers. New &quot;super poison puts&quot; are being added to offerings, broadening the conditions under which buyers are shielded if there is a change in control of the issuer.    Mr. Araskog said the poison put provisions inserted into bond covenants in the past failed to protect Hartford and other bondholders against price collapses caused by buy-out proposals. These earlier poison puts were intended to allow bondholders to get their money back if a buy-out was hostile, but the defense proved impotent as nearly all buy-outs eventually became &quot;friendly.&quot;    A few management buy-outs do serve shareholders, notably in cases where an outsider's initial bid is topped by management, Mr. Araskog said. He said that he has always opposed hostile bids and that when the ITT pension fund invested in the KKR buy-out pool, it understood that KKR's bids would be friendly. &quot;Of course, it's friendly now that the board is auctioning off the company, but that's probably not what others had in mind when they put the company together,&quot; Mr. Araskog said.    The ITT chairman said he &quot;applauded&quot; calls in Congress for reviews of the tax deductability of debt interest payments while corporate dividends are not higher because they are paid from after-tax profits. &quot;This whole area should be looked at,&quot; Mr. Araskog said. But he added: &quot;The last thing we want is an overreaction in Washington&quot; that might go beyond his concerns on leveraged buy-outs.    Some people see irony in ITT's stand, given the company's transformation into one of the original conglomerates through numerous acquisitions led by former Chairman Harold Geneen. Some also say that ITT itself may be concerned about its future as a potential takeover target.    Mr. Araskog says ITT never made an unfriendly acquisition and company officials say they don't know of any takeover possibilities involving ITT. </TEXT></DOC>
