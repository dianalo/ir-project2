MEARS</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   In President Bush's renewed war on drugs,there's no political argument about the enemy, the objective or eventhe weapons _ but partisan skirmishes already are flaring overpriorities, price and the way to pay for it.   Stripped to essentials, there really is no Republican way tocombat the drug menace and no Democratic way. The argument betweenthe parties, which means between the White House and Congress, isover how fast and how much.   And it also is over new taxes. Bush says no; the Democrats saythe cost of the drug war means at least maybe.   Political infighting about the war on drugs probably wasinevitable. It is ranked atop the current list of voter concerns, itfigured in the last campaign, and it may be the common denominatorissue in next year's congressional elections.   Bush saw it coming. ``But those who judge our strategy only byits price tag simply don't understand the problem,'' he said in hisTuesday night address to the nation. ``Let's face it, we've all seenin the past that money alone won't solve some of our toughestproblems.''   The Bush strategy points to a guns and butter sort of a war,although the president said that there would be hard times and highcosts ahead. He said he wants to add $2.2 billion to the war ondrugs. In budget terms, all but $716 million already is included inproposals the administration has sent to Congress. The White Housewould offset that by cutting other programs, one at the Pentagon,the rest on the domestic agenda.   ``We can pay for this fight against drugs without raising taxesor adding to the budget deficit,'' Bush said.   Sen. Joseph Biden of Delaware, who delivered the Democrats'televised response, said the Bush plan would wage a limited war, onthe cheap. ``We don't oppose the president's plan,'' said Biden, whoas chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee wields legislativepower over major portions of it. ``All we want to do is strengthenit.''   While the president asked support and commitment of a united,angry America, he did not spell out costs in terms of sacrifice.That word turned up in a public opinion poll conducted as part ofthe buildup to the drug report. George Gallup Jr. said the surveyfound a majority of the public ready to accept sacrifices as inwartime, including higher taxes, if necessary to combat drugs.   House Speaker Thomas Foley said the drug war eventually will leadto increasing pressure for a tax increase. Even Rep. Robert H.Michel, the Republican leader, said there might have to be anotherlook at financing for the program after a year.   That flowed into the debate over the budget, the deficit and thetaxes Bush ruled out in every speech of his campaign for thepresidency. That continuing struggle may embroil facets of the drugprogram just as it threatened to snarl the legislation bailing outthe shaken savings and loan system.   Bush said Congress should offer leadership and bipartisan supportto the strategy it asked the new president to prepare in the firstplace. ``And our citizens deserve cooperation, not competition; anational effort, not a partisan bidding war,'' he said.   In his televised response, Biden proposed sharp spendingincreases in a half-dozen pieces of the drug war Bush outlined. Hedidn't give a total price tag, nor did he suggest a way to pay forit. He has suggested higher liquor and cigarette taxes as a sourceof drug-fighting revenues.   The drug debate this fall will be in Congress. Next fall it willbe nationwide, as the candidates of 1990 make the issue part oftheir campaigns for seats in a new Congress.   In campaign settings, the debate over drugs usually centers onwho'll be tougher and more effective in fighting them. That's theway it was when Bush and Gov. Michael Dukakis dealt with drugs intheir 1988 presidential campaign.   While there are differences over the proper mix betweenpunishment and drug education and treatment, the issue is not one onwhich parties or politicians can pick clearly opposing sides. Sothey argue about who can do better with the weapons both politicalsides support.   In his 22-minute nationally televised speech, Bush said the newattack he envisions can succeed where others have failed because itwill mobilize all the nation's resources in a coordinated driveagainst drugs. ``... The basic weapons we need are the ones wealready have,'' he said. ``What has been lacking is a strategy toeffectively use them.''   The Democrats agree on the weaponry. Indeed, the major elementsof the drug war were summed up in one sentence of the DemocraticParty platform a summer ago. It was a very long sentence _ 105words, to be exact.   But they don't necessarily agree that the administration strategyis the best way to deploy those weapons.   Bush may gain the united front he seeks. But it will come afterthe political debate, not before it.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Walter R.
