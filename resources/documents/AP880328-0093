The soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were whistling andshouting as they boarded the planes, the first of the Americancontingent to leave Honduras.   ``This is nice, it's beautiful,'' said Sgt. Elliott Cook, 22, ofMiami, when he saw the planes to carry him and his fellow soldiershome. ``I am happy to go home because nothing happened.''   Outside the Palmerola Air Base, about 200 Hondurans demonstratedtheir support for the Americans.   They carried signs saying, ``Thanks for having helped usmaintain our liberty'' and ``Unity makes for democracy, thanks forbeing here.''   The paratroopers were scheduled for an airdrop into their homebase of Fort Bragg, N.C.   They are part of a force rushed to Honduras for 11 days oftraining exercises to flex U.S. military muscles after a reportedincursion by about 2,000 Nicaraguan troops chasing U.S.-supportedContra rebels.   ``I'm sure they'll be home for a late dinner at least,'' Maj.Gary Hovatter, the U.S. military public affairs officer at thisbase 40 miles northwest of the Honduran capital of Tegucigalpa,said Sunday. He said the soldiers would probably parachute intoFort Bragg at about 5 p.m. EST today.   ``It's great to be going home,'' said Sgt. Dale Taylor, 22, ofRed Springs, N.C. ``It's going to be a sis-boom-bah occasion.They're going to have a band and our families will be there.''   President Reagan ordered 3,200 paratroopers and light infantryto Honduras on March 17 and 18. Honduran President Jose Azcona Hoyoasked for a show of force against after the reported incursion.   Nicaragua denied the report and claimed the United States waspreparing to invade or using the deployment as a cover forproviding equipment to the Contras. U.S. officials have said thetroops are taking back all the equipment they brought with them,including tanks and aircraft.   ``First they'll have to go through a complete inventory ofproperty to make sure they can account for all the equipment theybrought,'' Hovatter said.   In addition to the 82nd Airborne, the reinforcements includesoldiers from the 7th Light Infantry in Fort Ord, Calif. All areexpected home by Wednesday.   The presence of the reinforcements, which raised U.S. strengthin Honduras to more than 6,000, alarmed the region and raised thealready high level of tension. Tensions eased when the Contras andthe Sandinistas signed a broad cease-fire accord last week afterthree days of talks in Sapoa, Nicaragua.   The U.S. troops never saw action, but the Honduran presidentsaid all along he expected them to back him up if the Sandinistasdidn't withdraw.   By late last week, Honduran officials said the Nicaraguan troopswere back on their own side of the border.   Capt. Steve Walker, 30, of New Milford, N.J., said he thinks thestrong U.S. presence helped bring about the cease-fire.   ``The Nicaraguans did cease action and they did withdraw andthey did sit down and start negotiation with the Contras withoutany shots being fired,'' he said. ``It was an effective display ofresolve.''</TEXT></DOC>
