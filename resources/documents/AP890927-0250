Nigerian Oil Minister Rilwanu Lukman, president of the 13-nationOrganization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, said the countrieswould lift their supply cap by a million barrels a day to 20.5million barrels.   Algeria declared the move illegal and Kuwait, who has beenopenly exceeding its production limit, said it had made nocommitments.   The head of the Algerian delegation, who demanded anonymity,said, ``It is something that Algeria doesn't associate itselfwith.''   ``It is a decision that is illegal,'' he said immediately afterthe ministers' final round of talks at a luxury Geneva hotel.   ``As far as we can see, it has kind of poor thinking behindit,'' he said.   Kuwaiti oil minister Sheik Ali Khalifa al-Sabah said his countrywould continue not to recognize any restrictions on its output. Hesaid Kuwait had made ``no commitments either legal or moral to holddown production.''   The disarray came in the fifth day of talks held to try to comeup with an acceptable production strategy in the final quarter ofthe year.   The ministers were at odds throughout the meeting over how muchthey could raise any production ceiling without sending pricessliding.   Algerian Oil Minister Sadek Boussena, who left the meetingMonday to return to Algiers for a legislative meeting, had pressedfor retaining the current ceiling of 19.5 million barrels a day.   He had said the cartel should concentrate on bringing prices upabout a dollar to the cartel's benchmark of $18 a barrel.   Others argued the market was strong enough to absorb theadditional supply.   The ministers failed to come up with a formula for meeting somecountries' demands for a higher share of OPEC's production.   ``We solved a good deal,'' Iraqi Oil Minister Issam al-Chalabisaid before the meeting. ``Maybe we'll leave something forNovember.''   The ministers were scheduled to meet in late November to plantheir production strategy for 1990.   The officials had spent the day studying a surprise Iranianproposal to see if it could form the basis of a compromise. Butthey deferred taking any action on the plan.   In its plan, Iran proposed the production ceiling be peggedabove 20.5 million barrels a day to take care of demands by Kuwait,the United Arab Emirates, Gabon, Ecuador and Qatar. It could go ashigh as 21.5 million barrels to cover them.   ``It's a good proposal,'' said a senior Kuwaiti delegate, whospoke on condition of anonymity.   As sketched by Iranian delegates, their formula would give all13 countries larger individual quotas, meaning they could producemore crude in the last quarter than now. But Kuwait, the UnitedArab Emirates, Gabon, Ecuador and Qatar would be given biggerpercentage shares.   Each country is assigned an individual quota, based on itspercentage share of the total. For example, Saudi Arabia, thecartel's No. 1 producer, has nearly a 25 percent share of the totalsupply.   Before the latest proposal, the members were considering a Saudiplan to push production up to 20.5 million barrels a day, accordingto a delegate. All countries would share proportionately in theincrease.   OPEC ministers have been meeting since Saturday to find a way toraise their output ceiling in the last quarter without sendingprices tumbling. The talks had been on the verge of collapse Mondayevening.   Crude prices have held fairly steady in recent months, despitereports that some members have been overproducing.   On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the November contract forWest Texas Intermediate, the key American brand, closed up 7 centson Tuesday at $19.53 a 42-gallon barrel, well above the cartel'sbenchmark $18 a barrel.   OPEC members are: Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran,Iraq, Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, the United ArabEmirates and Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
