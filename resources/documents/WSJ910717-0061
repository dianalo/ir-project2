Although the Michigan Democrat's proposal would allowbanks to affiliate with securities firms, it would prohibitcommercial companies from owning banks and head off effortsto allow banks to expand into the insurance business.</LP><TEXT>   Earlier this month, the House Banking Committee passed abank-overhaul plan that included many of the administration'sreform proposals, including an end to the separation ofbanking and commerce.   &quot;This is a tough proposal -- much tougher than theTreasury proposal,&quot; Sen. Riegle said in releasing the559-page draft bill. &quot;Mixing banking and commerce is riskybusiness. Now -- when our banks are in the worst shape sincethe Depression -- is no time to invite trouble or add to thedifficult challenges our regulators face already.&quot;   Nevertheless, administration officials praised the scopeof Sen. Riegle's proposal, which contains provisions tobolster the dwindling bank deposit-insurance fund, tightenbank regulation and allow banks to branch nationwide. &quot;We'repleased the chairman has taken a comprehensive approach,&quot;said Robert Glauber, Treasury undersecretary for finance.While there are parts of the proposal the Treasury will tryto change, &quot;the important thing is to keep the processgoing,&quot; he said.   The Riegle proposal will set off a round of negotiationamong interest groups and senators to make changes before thecommittee completes work on the bill and sends it to the fullSenate later this year.   Unlike the House, where the Banking Committee draftslegislation in long public sessions, the Senate paneloperates largely behind closed doors, trying to achieveconsensus in a series of private meetings. Mr. Riegleexpressed hope that his committee would complete itsconsideration of the bill before Congress breaks for theAugust recess.   The projected year-end insolvency of the bank depositinsurance fund is driving Congress to complete work on abanking bill by the end of the year. Like the bill passed bythe House Banking Committee last month, the Riegle proposalwould grant the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. $70 billionin new borrowing authority. Banks would pay back the loansover time.   The Riegle proposal would lead to higher premiums than theHouse plan, because it would require a fasterrecapitalization of the insurance fund and allow a temporaryspecial assessment on bank assets, in addition to the currentpremium that banks pay on domestic deposits. The asset-basedassessment would primarily hit large banks that dependheavily on foreign deposits, such as banking units ofCiticorp, J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. and Bankers Trust New York Corp.   Like the House bill, the Riegle plan contains provisionsdesigned to reduce future drains on the Bank Insurance Fund.It would require regulators to intervene quickly in theaffairs of weak banks and to close them before they becomeinsolvent. Starting in 1995, it would end the &quot;too big tofail&quot; policy, under which the government protects evenuninsured accounts -- foreign deposits and domestic depositsbeyond the $100,000 insurance ceiling -- in order to avoiddisrupting the banking system. Sen. Riegle would limit theFederal Reserve Board's ability to give weak banks long-termsupport with loans through its discount window.   Both the Riegle plan and the House bill would scale backdeposit insurance, although neither goes as far as theTreasury wants. Sen. Riegle acknowledged that he abandoned,in the face of political opposition, a plan to place strictlimits on the number of insured accounts a depositor canhave.   However, his bill would outlaw insurance on brokereddeposits, which are large certificates of deposits soldthrough brokers. This provision is certain to stir oppositionfrom Merrill Lynch andamp; Co., which led a successful campaignbefore the House panel to water down efforts to kill off the$80 billion brokered-deposit business. The proposal alsowould end deposit insurance coverage for bank investmentcontracts, which are giant certificates of deposit that bankssell to pension plans. There are about $20 billion of theseso-called BICS outstanding.   The Riegle plan would allow interstate branch bankingwithin three years, unless a state voted not to adopt thechange.   One proposal that the administration strongly opposeswould merge the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency,which regulates 4,200 national banks, and the Office ofThrift Supervision, which regulates thrifts, into a newindependent agency that would no longer be under Treasurycontrol.   Utah Sen. Jake Garn, the panel's ranking Republican, saidhe and his staff had worked closely with Sen. Riegle on theproposal. Although several differences remain, &quot;we're in farmore agreement than disagreement,&quot; Sen. Garn said.</TEXT></DOC>
