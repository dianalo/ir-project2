The Phase I, or safety, tests of the drug GM-CSF are scheduled to begin at the University of Texas-M.D. Anderson Hospital and Tumor Institute in Houston. The company said it expects multicenter clinical trials of the drug to begin in February here and in West Germany with a European partner.    Immunex said it has produced enough of the substance for Phase I and for Phase II, which is designed to test the drug's effectiveness. The Seattle-based concern, a developer of immunological therapies based on genetic engineering, said it will be manager of the trial for its European partner, Behringwerke AG, as well as for its own tests. Behringwerke is a unit of the West German pharmaceutical company Hoechst AG.    Immunex said the Phase I trials are expected to take six months and will involve 20 to 40 patients. In addition to determining whether the drug can be given safely, Phase I trials will set the dosage. The tests of its effectiveness haven't been scheduled.    GM-CSF, or granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor, is one of a new class of proteins that promote the production and growth of blood cells to fight infection. GM-CSF is thought to spark growth of granulocytes, or white blood cells, as well as macrophages, or so-called killer cells. The two types of cells attack microbes as well as tumor cells. Scientists hope that the substance ultimately will be useful in treating a number of diseases.    Jordan A. Gutterman, chairman of clinical immunology and biological therapy at M.D. Anderson, said the tests will focus on &quot;patients with different malignancies and with bone marrow damaged by chemotherapy, radiation or bone marrow transplantation.&quot; He said one hope is that the drug, if effective, might be used before or after chemotherapy to allow a patient to receive more of a potent tumor-fighter.    Dr. Gutterman said he believes that GM-CSF may work in a variety of ways. First, he said, it may stimulate not only white blood cells, which fight infection, but also platelets and young red blood cells. Second, it may stimulate macrophages that kill invading organisms. Third, the substance may prompt the wildly proliferating, but immature cells of a tumor to mature and function more normally, thus theoretically stopping the malignancy.    Although Dr. Gutterman noted that GM-CSF's &quot;potential medical applications are many,&quot; he cautioned against premature expectations of a drug that is only beginning the long and arduous testing process.    Immunex is one of several companies making and testing colony-stimulating factors. Genetics Institute Inc. is working with the pharmaceutical concern Sandoz Inc. to make and test GM-CSF. Their version of the drug currently is in clinical trials in Boston and Los Angeles among patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS.    Genetics Institute, of Cambridge, Mass., is a developer of human pharmaceuticals and diagnostic products using recombinant DNA and related technologies. Sandoz is based in East Hanover, N.J. </TEXT></DOC>
