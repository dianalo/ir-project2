(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>BREAKING DOWN THE PRODUCTION BARRIERandM;In the early 1980s, mainframe purchasers of a DBMS had many choices andsimple-folk wisdom to guide them.andP;  Two of the choices were &quot;designer&quot; systemsintended for building serious transaction processing applications, or &quot;user&quot;systems designed to make the data easily accessible to end users, such asmarket analysts.andM;Little ambiguity existed as to which category a DBMS fell into, although allvendors tried to sell to both markets.andP;  The designer systems included IMSfrom IBM, IDMS from the former Westwood, Mass.-based Cullinet, and Total fromCincinnati-based Cincom.andM;The user systems included Adabas from Software AG, Reston, VA., Datacom/DBfrom the former Applied Data Research (ADR), Inc., Princeton, N.J., and Model204 from Computer Corporation of America, Cambridge, Mass.andP;  Focus fromInformation Builders, Inc., New York; Ramis from On-Line SoftwareInternational, Ft.andP;  Lee, N.J.; and Nomad from Must Software, Norwalk Conn.,andO;straddled the two camps.andM;A &quot;new&quot; approach called relational appeared, but the &quot;big guys&quot; did not takeit seriously.andM;IBM had this experiment project, System R, and it was fun to guess when theywould make a product out of it, but mainframe people tended to dismiss therelational stuff as a new style of an end-user system.andM;The decade is almost over, but in the past few years the DBMS world hasradically changed.andP;  ADR and Cullinet Software are no longer independentcompanies.andM;The future of ADR's Datacom and Cullinet's IDMS is now controlled by CAI,which must develop and deliver a solution to the problem of what to do aboutfundamentally incompatible DBMSs.andM;Model 204, Ramis and Nomad have each gone through at least one change ofhands.andM;Cincom of Cincinnati has gradually increased its emphasis on applications andon its fourth-generation language, Mantis.andM;Even the rising relational stars of themini world, Oracle and Ingres, havemet with limited success in the mainframe world.andM;Relational Technology Inc., Menlo Park.andP;  Calif., has stopped marketing Ingresfor mainframes.andP;  Oracle Corp., Belmont, Calif., the largest independentvendor of DBMSs and the third largest independent software firm, has but arelatively small share of the mainframe business.andM;To what can we attribute this radical market restructuring?andP;  Answer: To theincredible success of DB2 on MVS and SQL/DS on VM.andM;When SQL/DS and DB2 were first released, many data processing professionals,tended to dismiss them.andP;  These products were slow and required a large amountof system resources.andM;For the less sophisticated applications of the VM market, they would concedethat SQL/DS would be acceptable, but DB2 was inappropriate for the dataprocessing tasks of the MVS world.andP;  Not only was it slow, it lacked thesupporting tools, such as data dictionaries, that were essential to theapplications for which organizations used IMS and IDMS.andM;IBM dedicated an enormous amount of technical, marketing and sales resourcesto ensure that DB2 and SQL/DS would be good and their acceptance virtuallyuniversal.andM;It has succeeded in achieving both goals.andP;  With the release of versin 2,there is little doubt that DB2 is a credible product.andP;  Today, it is for bothinformation center applications and low transaction-oriented applications.andM;There are two major improvements in version 2.andP;  Most important for productionapplications is the greatly increased performance.andM;IBM measurements showed that queries involving a sort were four times fasterthan version 1, and required only one-half the CPU Time.andP;  Most SQL Selectstatements are affected, including those with multiple tables (or joins),Group By, or Order By clauses.andM;In addition, improvements are evident in the locking, the optimizationalgorithms and the use of indexes, along with better management of diskwrites.andM;A second major change is the addition of support for referential integrity.andO;In most RDBMSs, it is necessary to write code in programs to avoid storing areference to a nonexistent record.andM;Structured systems such as IMS and IDMS do not have this problem because therelationship between records is explicitly defined during the databasedefinition.andP;  The designer can make it virtually impossible to store a recordthat is not consistent with other data in the database.andM;All relationships among tables are maintained by common values.andP;  Customersand their orders are related by the presence of the customer number in boththe Customer table and the Orders table.andM;In most relational systems, there is nothing to prevent a user from storingan order with a customer number that does not match any customer number inthe customer table.andP;  Furthermore, if a customer row is deleted, allreferences to the customer number must be altered to maintain the consistencyof the database.andM;All transactions against the database must maintain this referentialintegrity, otherwise the database may be corrupted.andP;  Most systems require theprogrammer to write validation code to prevent this.andM;In addition, the same code may be required in many different places for eachreference between tables.andP;  IBM has addressed this problem by allowingreferential integrity rules to be specified at database design-time.andP;  Thissimplifies programming and increases the reliability of the data in thedatabase.andM;The method chosen by IBM substantially conforms with the proposed revision tothe SQL standard.andP;  No other relational mainframe vendor has yet released asystem with this kind of referential integrity support.andM;Mike DeVries, account executive in the San Francisco office of GE Consulting,and Sue Goodman, senior consultant in the Denver office, have workedextensively in helping large corporations to migrate to DB2.andP;  (The mainheadquarters for GE Consulting is in Rockville, Md.)andM;DeVries said he knew of two companies that have implementedtransaction-oriented applications with processing speeds comparable to thoseof any other DBMS.andM;The first conversion involved an aerospace manufacturing firm which migratedfrom IDMS.andP;  According to DeVries, the firm runs six DB2 sessions on an IBM3090 model 600E with 64Mb plus 192Mb of expanded memory.andP;  It processes about250,000 transactions per day with a total of over nine million SQL calls perday.andP;  The largest table is over 23 million rows.andM;Another company converted a system from Fortran and Assembler to DB2.andP;  Itprocesses about 700,000 transactions per day, and averages 15 to 20transactions per second, DeVries said.andM;Most organizations' transactions are very different from those transactionsthat produce 200 to 300 transactions per second.andP;  Such large numbers areusually based on relatively simple transactions that require only a handfulof database accesses.andM;More typical are the transactions that require between 20 and 50 databaseaccesses or joining more than three tables.andM;In the previous example, the 250,000 transactions per day average 36 SQLcalls each.andP;  For these types of applications, transaction performance of 20to 50 transactions per second is high, and not easy to achieve.andM;Conversion presents a barrier for some organizations that want to enter theDB2 world.andP;  (See related conversion tool feature, on page 50.)andP;  Many reducethe problem by using DB2 for new applications, and only convert existingapplications at the end of their life cycle.andM;Because GE Consulting has had experience in technology migrations, one of itsspecialties is IDMS to DB2 conversions.andP;  Tools from Forecross Corp. of SanFrancisco are used to automate the conversion of both the database and theapplication code.andM;DeVries points out that for some applications, implementation may make themost sense; for others, a blind conversion (data structure and calls aretranslated directly to their DB2 equivalent) is the best alternative.andP;  Insome cases it may be preferable to do a straight conversion to DB2 and thenoptimize the result, rather than implement both changes in one step.andM;Automated tools can make a significant difference in the time it takes to doa conversion, and in the quality of the result.andM;GRADUAL MOVE TO DB2andM;For most companies, the move to DB2 is a gradual one.andP;  Doug Stacey, a seniortechnical consultant at Baxter Healthcare Corp. in Deerfield, Ill., tells howhis group is moving from IMS to DB2.andM;According to company policy, all new or significantly changed applicationsshould use DB2.andP;  Initial applications are retrieval-oriented.andP;  For example,Baxter has a sales history database of over 50 gigabytes maintained in IMS.andM;For analysis, however, they have an extracted DB2 database that runs on aseparate IBM 3084QX.andM;In moving from release 1 of DB2 to release 2, Baxter went from CPU-bound toI/O-bound, despite the large number of channels on its computer.andP;  Staceyreports that even though release 2 makes more efficient use of CPU thanrelease 1, it still requires about 20% more CPU than IMS for inputtransactions.andM;Scott Foresman and Company, an educational publisher based in Glenview, Ill.,andO;is making the transition to DB2 from Vsam.andP;  Bill Backs, director ofinformation technology, says the company has a growing need for end-useraccess to the data.andM;Scott Foresman chose DB2 because it wanted a relational system that adheredto SQL standards and which would be in the mainstream of IBM's products,Backs said.andP;  All corporate data is now available in DB2, including sales andmarketing, inventory and forecasting.andM;Users may access the data through QMF from IBM or the SAS-DB2 interface fromSAS Institute, Cary, N.C.andP;  For PC Access, Backs says the firm has beenpleased with PC/SQL Link from Micro Decisionware of Boulder, Colo.andM;Backs says he believes the only way to take advantage of DB2's strengths andget good performance is to do a good job of database design.andP;  All newapplications are being implemented in DB2.andM;Scott Foresman is taking its time to redesign applications in DB2.andP;  It isalso investigating application development languages in which to write thesenew applications.andM;Backs said the company feels that IBM's Cross System Product is toocumbersome to give them additional productivity gains.andM;DB2, NATURAL TOGETHER IN TEXASandM;The Texas State Comptroller's office in austin has also made a move to DB2.andM;Ed Lee, supervisor for operations support, says that most new applicationsare being developed using DB2 as the data manager.andP;  Software AG's Natural isthe programming language.andM;Ntural is just as effective when hooked to DB2 as when it works with Adabas,its sister DBMS.andP;  In fact, Software AG realized early on that coexistencewith DB2 was a necessity, unlike Cullinet, which tried to fight SQL and DB2.andM;The Taxpayer Information System is a mix of DB2 tables and Vsam files, withone DB2 table containing 23 million rows.andP;  This is primarily an interactiveinquiry application, with the database updated in batch mode.andM;In database administration tools, the Bachman/Re-engineering Product Set fromBachman Information Systems, Cambridge, Mass., is used to document thelogical model, and assists with the physical design.andM;DB Optimize from DBView, Inc., Waltham, Mass., helps with databaseadministration tasks for path analysis.andP;  The Platinum Toolset from PlatinumTechnology, Lombard, Ill., also assists in a variety of databaseadministrator tasks.andM;For end-user decision support type of applications the company uses Express,Focus and IBM's QMF.andM;Currently, the company tends to select those applications that areinformation-intensive and not transaction-intensive.andP;  A large imageapplication that consumes over five 3380 disk packs is an example.andM;Dispelling prior prejudices, DB2 is being used effectively in manufacturingapplications.andP;  The Manufacturing and Control System (MAC-PAC) from AndersenConsulting, Chicago, was recently ported to DB2 from IMS, according to KentWorrell, manager of technical support.andP;  He says that the performance of thenew version is comparable to the performance of the IMS version.andM;The actual bill-of-materials explosion is slower in DB2 than IMS because ofthe many joins, compared to chasing IMS embedded pointers.andM;However, Worrell points out that this explosion is not a frequent task, andis usually confined to batch reports.andM;The system contains about 2 million lines of source code, 2,500 compilableobjects and a database of 65 tables, 300 screens and 200 reports.andP;  Totalconversion took about 3,000 work-days; most of the time was spent in planningand testing.andM;Only about 10% to 15% of the effort was in the actual port of the databasedesign and the code.andP;  Worrell attributes the speed of the conversion in partto a well-designed original database and because the code was writtenaccording to strict corporate standards.andM;DB2 is an important part of IBM's SAA strategy of providing uniform accessacross the variety of platforms and operating systems.andM;The forthcoming IBM Repository is a database about the informationenvironment of an organization.andP;  The database on which it will be builtinitially is DB2, eventually spreading to the other SAA DBMSs.andM;DB2 has definitely arrived.andP;  As IBM continues to improve DB2, and as thestrategic importance of DB2 increases with developments, such as theRepository, it will eventually dominate all phases of mainframe databaseapplications.andM;Edelstein is a principal of Euclid Associates, Berkeley, Calif., a firm whichdoes consulting work for both vendors and users.andP;  The company also sponsorsprofessional seminars.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
