YangStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 11/16/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> GOVMTBANKS, THRIFT INSTITUTIONS (BNK)CONGRESS (CNG) </IN><TEXT>   The Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. is seeking $15 million from the senior Republican member of the House Ways and Means Committee, two of his sons, and other officers of a failed Knoxville, Tenn., savings and loan institution.    The civil suit, filed Friday in federal court in Knoxville, charges that Tennessee Rep. John Duncan, John Duncan Jr., Joe Duncan, and 13 other officers of Knox Federal Savings andamp; Loan Association allowed &quot;numerous unsound transactions&quot; to take place that &quot;caused Knox to become insolvent.&quot;    The suit alleges no specific wrongdoing by Rep. Duncan, a 12-term member of the House. Rep. Duncan was a member of the thrift's board from 1981 to 1984 and served as its president from January 1981 through January 1982, according to the suit.    The suit charges that John Duncan Jr., now a Knoxville criminal court judge who was a member of the thrift's board, and Joe Duncan, who was a vice president of the institution, conspired with other officers of Knox Federal and with Tennessee financier C.H. Butcher Jr. to give Mr. Butcher control of the thrift in 1981.    In exchange, according to the suit, Mr. Butcher arranged to relieve Joe Duncan of a loan of more than $250,000 from United American Bank of Knoxville, which was owned by Mr. Butcher's brother, Jake Butcher. The debt was partially guaranteed by John Duncan Jr., the suit said.    When the Butcher brothers' banking empires collapsed in 1983, Knox Federal was found to have made millions of dollars of loans to C.H. Butcher Jr., his wife and associates, and engaged in extensive dealings with his banks. Federal regulators found Knox Federal to be insolvent and closed the thrift Nov. 16, 1984.    C.H. Butcher Jr., who wasn't named as a defendant in the FSLIC's suit, is serving a 20-year prison sentence for bankruptcy and tax fraud.    Rep. Duncan denied that there was any sort of conspiracy. &quot;Anybody can file a civil lawsuit,&quot; he said. &quot;Collecting on it is another matter. . . . There was no conspiracy.&quot;    Judge Duncan said there was no basis for the lawsuit, according to the Associated Press.    Joe Duncan was convicted earlier this year of tax fraud in connection the transactions involving Mr. Butcher's takeover of Knox Federal but was acquitted of charges that he conspired with Mr. Butcher to eliminate his debt. Neither Joe Duncan, who is appealing his conviction, nor his attorney could be reached for comment.    In June, Ursula Meese, wife of Attorney General Edwin Meese, wrote a letter asking a federal judge to give &quot;very favorable consideration&quot; to Joe Duncan, who was awaiting sentencing. In court papers, the Justice Department had recommended a three-year prison term and a &quot;substantial&quot; fine of as much as $100,000. Judge R. Allan Edgar eventually sentenced him to three years in prison, suspending all but six months of it, a $3,000 fine, and 400 hours of community service. </TEXT></DOC>
