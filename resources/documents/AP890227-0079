RUBIN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Supreme Court today agreed to take a freshlook at how far cities may go to limit sexually oriented businesses.   The court will study a Dallas zoning and licensing ordinancechallenged by owners of adult bookstores, motion picture theaters,nightclubs, motels and nude-model studios.   The challengers say the law violates their freedom of expression.   Last week, the high court ruled in an Indiana case that statesmay use anti-racketeering laws to crack down on pornography. But inthat case the court also ruled that businesses dealing with sexuallyexplicit materials may not be shut down before a judicialdetermination that at least some of the materials are obscene.   The 1986 Dallas ordinance requires that sexually orientedbusinesses be at least 1,000 feet apart and at least 1,000 feet fromany church, school, residential area or park.   Any existing business in violation of the regulation has threeyears to move or shut down.   The businesses also are required to obtain a license issued bythe chief of police, and must permit inspection of their premisesduring operating hours.   Also, the ordinance bars anyone convicted of a variety of crimes,such as promotion of prostitution, from operating a sexuallyoriented business. And it requires that viewing rooms in adulttheaters be open to permit surveillance by management.   The regulations also bar motel owners from renting rooms for lessthan 10 hours, a provision designed to discourage prostitution.   The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled last February thatthe ordinance is a legitimate attack on crime, urban blight anddeclining property values.   The appeals court noted that the Supreme Court in 1986 upheld asomewhat similar ordinance in Renton, Wash., restricting thelocation of adult theaters.   Operators of adult entertainment outlets in Dallas said theregulations in the Texas city are much stricter. They said dozens ofbusinesses will be forced to shut down because at least 106establishments must relocate and there are only 50 availablelocations.   But the 5th Circuit court said the Dallas ordinance does notviolate free speech or other rights protected by the Constitution.   The city council's ``consideration of the criminal effects ofconcentrated sexually oriented businesses was thorough, as was itsreview of the effects such concentrations have on property values,''the appeals court said. ``In short, Dallas has demonstrated that theordinance furthers a substantial government interest.''   The appeals court also said the city demonstrated ``a compellingjustification'' for its licensing requirements even though aless-strict standard would be adequate to uphold the regulations.   For example, ``The city need only show that (a criminal)conviction and the evil to be regulated bear a substantialrelationship,'' the appeals court said.   It added that the discretion given the police chief under theordinance to issue, suspend and revoke licenses is not impermissiblybroad.   The appeals court also rejected arguments that the city ordinanceviolates privacy rights by insisting that establishments offeringsexually oriented entertainment be open to inspection by authoritieswithout search warrants.   In other action, the court:   _ Agreed to decide whether the rights of white criminaldefendants may be violated when blacks are excluded from serving asjurors in their trials.   The justices said they will hear an appeal by Daniel Holland, aChicago-area white man sentenced to 85 years in prison for rape,kidnaping and armed robbery.   _ Turned down a challenge to his conviction by Bernhard Goetz,who in 1984 shot four young men he said were going to rob him on aNew York City subway.   The court, without comment, rejected arguments that Goetz weasdenied a fair trial. Goetz, who was sentenced to a year in jail andfined $5,000, began his imprisonment at the Rikers Island jail inNew York City last month. He is eligible for, but not assured of,parole after 51 days.   _ Refused to revive an affirmative action program in South Bend,Ind., that called for hiring more blacks and Hispanics asfirefighters and police officers.   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that struck downthe plan after it was challenged by a white man denied a job as afirefighter.   _ Rejected ``reverse discrimination'' arguments by a whiteVallejo, Calif., firefighter denied a promotion that went to a blackman with a slightly lower test score.   The court, without comment, let stand a ruling that upheld theblack man's promotion to help achieve better racial balance withinthe fire department.   _ Let stand a ruling that someone who plans a bank robbery but isarrested before actually moving toward the bank may not be convictedof violating a federal law prohibiting attempted bank robbery.   The court, over two dissenting votes, rejected a JusticeDepartment appeal that sought reinstatement of an attempted bankrobbery conviction in a California case.   _ Turned down appeals by former Rep. Mario Biaggi, D-N.Y., andformer Brooklyn, N.Y., Democratic boss Meade Esposito aimed atoverturning their convictions for exchanging illegal gratuities.   The court, without comment, cleared the way for Biaggi'simprisonment on a 2{-year term. Esposito was sentenced to two yearsprobation and 500 hours of community service.   The cases involving sexually oriented businesses are FW@PBS Inc.vs. Dallas, 87-2012; MJR Inc. vs. Dallas, 87-2051; and Berry vs.Dallas, 88-49.</TEXT></DOC>
