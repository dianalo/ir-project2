(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The FBI tried to buy names of unemployedworkers in the Portland area last year in hopes of tracking downfugitives, but Oregon Employment Division officials rejected therequest, a newspaper reported Monday.   FBI officials said the proposal was a routine technique forcatching criminals, but an employee approached at the division'soffice in Portland's Skid Row said she was concerned about violatingthe confidentiality of the agency's mostly impoverished clientele,the Salem Statesman-Journal reported in a copyright story Monday.   ``I'm all for helping the police and the FBI,'' said PattiSherman. ``But on the other hand, this is a homeless shelter whereindividuals come and want to feel safe. I would have felt like a spyif I sold their names. That's the most dishonest thing I personallycould have done.''   Employment Division director W.E. Hunter disclosed the FBI'sproposal after a division worker in Springfield was fired last monthfor notifying law enforcement officials that a client was wanted ona probation violation charge in Washington state.   Karen Hulsey, a 12-year veteran of the division, has appealed herfiring. Hunter said she violated the division's privacy policy,which he re-emphasized after the FBI's proposal was made last year.   In October 1987, FBI agents tried to obtain lists of unemployedpeople visiting the state office in Portland's Skid Row. That actionwas part of a national FBI effort to purchase names, Social Securitynumbers and birth dates of clients and employees of privatecompanies and government agencies, said James Dietz, a special agentin the FBI's Portland office.   The state agency said the FBI wanted more than lists of clients.   If the names of fugitives appeared on the lists, the FBI wanteddivision workers to contact the fugitives and tell them to visit thedowntown office for job interviews, according to state officials.FBI agents would be waiting to arrest the job applicants.   Hunter rejected the request on the advice of his staff and anassistant state attorney general who said it could violate stateprivacy laws and endanger division employees.   The FBI offered to pay $2 for the name of each client and $300 to$400 for a name if it turned out to be that of a wanted felon,division officials said.   Hunter said he would be willing to release such information on acase-by-case basis.   ``But they wanted more than just information,'' he said. ``Thiswas a sting-like operation.''   During the past 20 years, the FBI has caught thousands offugitives by feeding such information into a national computersystem that checks the data against a list of about 25,000 currentlywanted criminals, said Charles Mathews, the assistant special agentin charge of the Portland office.</TEXT></DOC>
