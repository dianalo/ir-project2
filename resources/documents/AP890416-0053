Organizers said 75,000 people participated. Police put thefigure at just more than 21,000.   ``More than ever, demonstrations are necessary,'' said HugoOngena, a spokesman for anti-nuclear activists who organized themarch.   Belgium's center-left coalition government said Tuesday itwanted NATO to delay plans to modernize its short-range nucleararms in Europe and agree to open East-West negotiations on theissue as soon as possible.   West Germany has taken a similar position.   The United States and Britain seek a swift commitment toupgrading the missiles, including extending their range, now about70 miles. The two countries also reject any East-West negotiationsin view of the Warsaw Pact's superiority in these arms.   The issue is to be debated on Wednesday and Thursday at ameeting of NATO defense ministers in Brussels, where the alliancehas its headquarters.   Anti-nuclear activists in Belgium want all nuclear missilesremoved from Europe. Ongena had mixed feelings about thegovernment's plans to ask for East-West talks and a delay inmodernizing the missiles.   ``We don't flunk the government but it doesn't graduate withdistinction,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
