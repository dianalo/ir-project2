Zia put the so-called Shariah Law into effect Wednesday night ina televised address to the nation. He said his decree makes Islam``the supreme law of Pakistan'' but will not affect the rights ofnon-Moslems or Pakistan's business contracts with other nations.   The official Pakistan Times newspaper trumpeted ``Shariat AtLast'' on page one. A report in the English-language Daily Muslim,however, quoted Ms. Bhutto as telling Pakistani journalists at aWednesday reception that her archfoe Zia had ``no right to imposehis will on the people of Pakistan.''   Other newspapers carried similar accounts.   Ms. Bhutto, leader of the Pakistan People's Party, was quoted assaying:   ``It has been the PPP's stand that Islam, like in the past, isagain being used to perpetuate oppressive rule.''   Gen. Zia, who also is chief of the army, surprised the nation onMay 29 by firing his entire civilian government and dissolving theNational Assembly.   He claimed that in three years in power, they failed to enactthe Islamic code and to battle deteriorating law and order.   Zia hinted that elections would be announced within 90 days buthe has yet to set a date.   Zia ousted Ms. Bhutto's father, Prime Minister Zulfikar Alibhutto, in a 1977 military coup and had him hanged two years laterfor complicity in a murder plot.   After ruling eight years with martial law, Zia allowed creationof a civilian government in 1985. The opposition press dubbed hisfiring of that government ``Zia's second coup d'etat.''   Ms. Bhutto had cautiously welcomed the prospect of new electionsafter having boycotted the 1985 voting, but she lashed out at Zia'slatest move as an abuse of power.   ``We believe it is not the business of a caretaker government oran individual to impose their views on the nation,'' she was quotedas saying. ``As in the past, we will resist any such move.''   She repeated her call for free elections and denied reports thather advancing pregnancy would keep her from preaching the party'splatform of popular socialism.   She married Karachi businessman Asif Zardari last December andat 35, is expecting her first child this December.   ``We would like constitutional continuity which calls forelections within 90 days. If you break this continuity, it wouldamount to opening a Pandora's box,'' Ms. Bhutto was quoted assaying.</TEXT></DOC>
