TedWeiss, D-N.Y., said in opening a hearing on criminal casesinvestigated by the department's inspector general.   ``Our preliminary review of these cases indicates that justiceis not blind when it comes to corruption at the Department ofEducation,'' said Weiss, who chairs the Government Operationssubcommittee on human resources.   Much of the discussion centered on two-year-old charges againstMadeleine Will, assistant secretary for special education and theestranged wife of conservative columnist George Will.   The inspector general, James B. Thomas Jr., said his officerecommended that Mrs. Will be criminally charged based on findingsthat she had used a department car and driver for personalbusiness, had claimed travel expenses that were never incurred, andhad authorized payments to a special assistant in her office forfour months after terminating the woman's employment.   Thomas said the assistant U.S. attorney indicated the case wouldbe prosecuted, but Joseph DiGenova, the U.S. attorney at the time,decided it should be treated as a civil matter. Mrs. Will and twoothers involved paid restitution totaling $15,000 to the department.   Thomas said he wrote two letters asking why the U.S. attorney'soffice had decided not to prosecute. Some weeks later he received areply citing insufficient evidence of criminal intent and anoverall lack of merit.   ``I was uncomfortable with it,'' Thomas said of DiGenova'sdecision. ``When we have sufficient evidence ... then I feel thereshould be a prosecution.''   Asked if the treatment of Mrs. Will was comparable to thetreatment of others charged with similar offenses, Thomas replied,``The record on that is very mixed.''   Mary Rose, deputy undersecretary for management, denied thatthere was a double standard of justice at her department. ``Eachcase is taken individually,'' she said. ``A number of factors haveto be considered,'' including whether a person is a career civilservant or a political appointee.   Guidelines attached to Rose's testimony said that by law,willful use or authorization of a government vehicle for other thanofficial purposes must be punished by suspension of at least 30days or removal. Rose said willful intent was never proved in theWill case.   The guidelines say penalties for falsifying an attendance recordfor oneself or another employee should range from a five-daysuspension to removal for a first offense. The same range wasrecommended for falsifying documents and actual or attempted theftof government property.   Weiss contrasted Will's case with several others, all recordedin bi-annual reports to Congress by the department's inspectorgeneral. Among them:   _A department employee pleaded guilty to filing false timerecords involving $2,000. She was required to make restitution,received an 18-month suspended jail sentence, and was placed onthree years' probation.   _A Utah man received a suspended jail sentence and paid a $2,500fine for understating his income so his wife could get a $5,000student loan.   _An employee was fired and another suspended without pay for 13days for backdating civil rights reports when they couldn't meettimetables set by the department.   _A department pool driver was suspended for 60 days without payfor using his official vehicle on personal business.   Mrs. Will, in a June 22 letter to The Washington Post, said shedid not know that her former aide was not at her work station whileher salary was continuing. She said she had acknowledgedresponsibility by making full restitution, but ``never did Iknowingly violate any government regulation.''   The letter, made available by the Education Department, did notaddress the other allegations.</TEXT></DOC>
