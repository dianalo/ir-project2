Volume on the Big Board came to 21.58 million shares as of 10a.m. on Wall Street.   The pace of business activity dropped off significantly inMarch, according to the results of a monthly survey of corporatepurchasing executives.   That was taken as supporting evidence for the widely held beliefon Wall Street that the economy has been slowing since February,responding to credit-tightening over the past year by the FederalReserve in its efforts to restrain inflation.   Slower growth would presumably benefit the securities markets byreducing upward pressure on inflation and interest rates.   But some Wall Street analysts have voiced concern lately thatstock prices might suffer as investors anticipated an accompanyingdecline in corporate earnings growth and a possible recession.   Among actively traded blue chips, General Motors rose [ to 41|;McDonald's gained [ to 51{, and Exxon slipped \ to 43|.
