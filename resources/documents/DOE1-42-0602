Chelates of U(IV), Th(IV) and Pu(IV) with these pyrazoloneshave been isolated by solvent extraction. Analytical data of these complexesestablish their stoichiometry as M(PMAP){sub 4} and M(PMTFP){sub 4}.The shift of the carbonyl stretching frequency indicate chelation ofthe ligand to the metal ion. The PMR spectra of the uranium and thoriumchelates have also been recorded.</TEXT></DOC>
