(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A man police call ``a one man crimewave,'' has admitted to committing 600 to 700 burglaries in thecity over the past two years, authorities say.   Neil Patrick Green, 32, of Hartford was held in lieu of $32,000bail and awaited arraignment Wednesday in Superior Court on 50counts of burglary and 44 counts of larceny.   ``He was a one-man crime wave,'' said Detective Thomas J. Murphy.   Police said they have tied Green to 354 burglaries, but theysaid the judicial system couldn't handle prosecution in all thecases.   Murphy said Green succeeded partly because he was a good actor.   When a police officer responded to one burglary, Green offeredto help look for the suspect, police said. Another time, hecasually strolled down the sidewalk, bouncing a tennis ball.   Green once walked past police while carrying stolen speakers andtwice in one month stole a large television set from the sameapartment, officers said.   ``He tended to believe that if you didn't exhibit an attitude ofguilt, in most cases you'd be able to get away with it,'' saidMurphy.   Murphy said Green told him that he sold cocaine to finance hiseducation at Tunxis Community College in Farmington and got hookedon the drug. But he gave up dealing when he realized police wherecracking down on narcotics dealers and turned to burglary, Murphysaid.   As Green's cocaine habit grew to $300 a day, he averaged fourburglaries a day, usually in the morning and early afternoon, andtook about $1,000 worth of jewelry, electronic equipment and cashdaily, police said he told them.   Green admitted to between 600 and 700 burglaries in a writtenstatement, Lt. Thomas Moore Jr. said. He was arrested Aug. 31following a tip.</TEXT></DOC>
