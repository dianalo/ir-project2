The agency identified the four as Ortwin Heider ofHofheim, Hans-Jurgen Klisch of Meerbusch, HanneloreMirbach-Krahn of Meerbusch and Bodo Pawlik of Ratingen.   The SEC also charged a German mutual fund, UnionInvestment, and two Swiss companies, Nalasag Corp. of Genevaand Sigesse SA of Lausanne, with trading Contel stock andoptions ahead of the announcement. The two companies boughtthe securities through Smith Barney, Harris Upham andamp; Co. andUnion Investment bought its shares through Dean Witter.   Officials of Nalasag and of Sigesse couldn't be reachedfor comment.   Mr. Heider, one of the four West German defendants, said:&quot;I'm not an insider -- I heard a rumor, and the investigationwill clear that.&quot; He added that he knows one of the otherWest German defendants, but wouldn't say whether it was oneof the other three named by the SEC. &quot;Dealing on rumor is notinsider trading -- at least I hope not,&quot; he said.   Mr. Klisch, another of the individual defendants, is aDuesseldorf-based broker for Dean Witter. He says he iscooperating with the SEC, but insists that he cannot speakregarding the case in general. For himself, however, he says:&quot;To my knowledge, this was rumor and a recommendation byShearson Lehman -- that's why I bought.&quot; He said Shearsongave a buy recommendation; in addition, there were very goodfundamental reasons to buy. Mr. Klisch says Union Investment,is a Frankfurt-based group and one of his customers.   The other two West German defendants couldn't be reachedimmediately for comment.   The SEC charges were brought last week, soon after Contelagreed to merge with GTE for $6.2 billion. At the time, theagency didn't identify any of the defendants but was granteda temporary restraining order by a federal court barring thedefendants from selling their stock or options.   On Friday, the SEC also issued a laundry list of trades ofboth stock and options that it says were insider trades onmaterial non-public information. It also dropped chargesagainst buyers of some call options through Advest Inc.,Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. and Smith Barney.   None of the banks or brokerage firms have been chargedwith any wrongdoing in the case.</TEXT></DOC>
