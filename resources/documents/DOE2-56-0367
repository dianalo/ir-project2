However, there has been little agreement over what preciselythe different cases ought to be, or exactly where the semantic boundariesbetween the different cases ought to be drawn. This is troubling fromtwo points of view. From a theoretical perspective one might expect moreconvergence in dealing with such a useful and intuitively appealing idea.From an applied perspective, the problem is that an interface built withone system of cases is often difficult to port to another domain. Theapproach described here deals with both of these issues. A case hierarchyis developed as the basis for a procedure of domain analysis. This providesa way of systematizing the process of analyzing the case structure developedfor a particular domain, and determining the ways in which it would haveto be altered for a new one.</TEXT></DOC>
