(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Union leader Paul Hubbert, who builtAlabama's school workforce into a political force, became theDemocratic nominee for governor Tuesday, defeating state AttorneyGeneral Don Siegelman in a runoff.   With 97 percent of the precincts reporting, Hubbert had 297,843votes or 53 percent to Siegelman's 259,471 votes or 47 percent.   Hubbert will challenge Republican Gov. Guy Hunt, a farmer,preacher and Ronald Reagan loyalist who in 1986 became the state'sfirst GOP governor in 112 years.   ``I intend to be the kind of New South, progressive governor whowill give the people of Alabama the kind of leadership theydeserve,'' Hubbert told cheering supporters Tuesday night.   Siegelman went to Hubbert's headquarters to congratulate him,and Hubbert supporters literally rolled out a red carpet for therunnerup. Hubbert and Siegelman held clasped hands aloft.   ``For those misguided souls who think the Democrats are nottogether, they've got another think coming in November,'' saidHubbert.   Hunt had depicted both Hubbert and Siegelman as liberals whowould have a hard time winning in Alabama.   Hubbert never ran for statewide public office before. But he hasdirected the Alabama Education Association for two decades, moldingit into an influential statehouse lobby for educators, bus drivers,janitors and other school personnel.   Hubbert, who led a six-candidate field in the June 5 primarywith 32 percent of the vote, promised to build ``positive,progressive programs that will raise Alabama into the New South.''   Siegelman, the runner-up, received 25 percent to force therunoff as he presented himself as a youthful force free offinancial ties to any interest group.   The three-week runoff campaign turned sharply negative.Siegelman attacked Hubbert as a special interest ``backroomoperator'' who helped teachers at the expense of schoolchildren.Hubbert stressed his record as a coalition-builder and accusedSiegelman of running a racist radio commercial.   Siegelman said the ad was about the power and the influence ofblack political organizer Joe Reed, the teachers union's No. 2 man,not his race.   Siegelman, 44, a former executive director of the AlabamaDemocratic Party who in 1972 managed George McGovern's presidentialcampaign in Alabama, tried to overtake Hubbert with an appeal toconservative and independent voters.   He accused Hubbert of supporting teachers so blindly that theunion gave legal representation to a convicted child molestertrying to return to classroom teaching.   The attorney general also claimed Hubbert's campaign promiseswould require doubling Alabama's $3.5 billion annual budget andraising $10 billion in new taxes over four years.   The centerpiece of Siegelman's campaign was a call for a statelottery and an increase in taxes on large timber tracts to pay forschool and health programs.   Hubbert, 54, who earned a doctorate in education, took charge ofthe union when separate black and white teacher groups merged in1969. Along with Reed, Hubbert helped the union more than triple insize to 70,000 members, with a payroll checkoff system buildingsubstantial political funds.   Hubbert traveled with a mop and bucket in hand as he urgedSiegelman to clean up the campaign. Hubbert also made jokingindirect references to Siegelman's admitted experimentation withmarijuana during college.</TEXT></DOC>
