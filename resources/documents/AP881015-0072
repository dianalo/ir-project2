The chief Soviet mapmaker, Viktor R. Yashchenko, told thegovernment newspaper Izvestia last month that roads, rivers andeven entire towns had been intentionally misplaced or left offpublic maps over the past half-century under orders of the secretpolice.   He said the distortions began in the 1930s under Soviet leaderJosef Stalin and continued until this year.   ``People did not recognize their own homeland on maps,'' he saidat the time. ``Tourists tried in vain to orient themselves tolocations.''   Sovietskaya Rossiya said the new, more detailed maps stemmedfrom ``glasnost,'' the drive for openness pushed by SovietPresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev.   Among the new titles planned are a road atlas, collections ofmaps of cities including Moscow and Leningrad, and hikers' atlasesfor the Caucasus mountains and the coasts of the Black Sea and Seaof Azov, the newspaper said.</TEXT></DOC>
