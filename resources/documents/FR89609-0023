Thoseamendments require, among other things, all aircraft operating in a TCAto be equipped with VOR or TACAN navigational equipment thereby eliminating,effective July 1, 1989, the previous exclusion for helicopters from thenavigation equipment requirement.Since that time, the FAA has received numerous requests for exemption fromthe helicopter equipment requirement, and petitions to allow the use ofcertain area navigational equipment for operations in a TCA. Specifically,the National Association of State Aviation Officials, in its letter ofJanuary 14, 1989, stated that many new generation helicopters are operatingwith LORAN-C as a primary navigation system, and that LORAN-C equipmentprovides better position information than VOR equipment. The ExperimentalAircraft Association (EAA), in its letter of January 5, 1989, advised theFAA that it had conducted an investigation concerning the TCA navigationequipment requirement. It was EAA's conclusion that LORAN-C produces moresatisfactory results for many users and is much more useful for helicopteroperations than VOR equipment. The Helicopter Association International(HAI) petitioned the FAA for a similar change to the equipment requirement_anexception to the VOR or TACAN requirements for visual flight rules (VFR)and special VFR helicopter operations. Several other organizations thatuse helicopters extensively have petitioned the FAA for exemption fromthe VOR/TACAN navigation equipment requirement citing that their aircraftare already equipped with LORAN-C.<ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion</ITAG>Section 91.33(d)(2) of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR) (14 CFR Part91) specifies that all civil aircraft used to conduct instrument flightrules (IFR) operations must have ``* * * navigational equipment appropriateto the ground facilities to be used.'' This provision is intentionallybroad to allow the use of a variety of ground-based navigational facilitieswhen conducting flight under IFR. However, the requirement is not applicableto public aircraft, i.e., aircraft used only in the service of a government,or a political subdivision, and foreign aircraft. Section 91.90 of theFAR, Terminal Control Areas, provides a more specific navigational equipmentrequirement for both civil and public aircraft conducting IFR operationsin a highly regulated air traffic control (ATC) environment. To illustrate,in the past, most departure and arrival procedures at TCA primary airportsinvolved navigation via specific VOR radials to a given point along anairway, route, or precision instrument approach procedure. In the currentradar environment the use of VOR radials in conjunction with departureand approach procedures is often replaced with radar vectoring procedures.However, the ATC system must be prepared to revert to a non-radar environmentshould the need arise, in which case, the VOR or TACAN requirement wouldbe critical to the continued ATC separation of aircraft.The need for specific navigational equipment for aircraft conducting operationsin a TCA under VFR is a different issue. In a radar environment departureand arrival operations conducted by aircraft under IFR or VFR are handledby ATC in very much the same manner. Traffic operating under VFR is generallyprovided with radar vectors to points beyond which navigation within theTCA can be accomplished using pilotage or dead reckoning procedures. Shouldthe radar become inoperative, ATC would simply allow VFR aircraft to navigatevia visual reference to known checkpoints and landmarks where such routescan be procedurally separated from those used by IFR aircraft.  <ITAG tagnum="84">The Rule  </ITAG>Therefore, based on the foregoing, the FAA by separate action intend topropose to amend the regulations to require VOR or TACAN navigational equipmentonly for aircraft conducting operations under IFR. Consequently, the FAAis delaying the effective date of the TCA navigational equipment requirementfor 180 days. This delay is necessary to allow interested parties to commenton the related equipment proposal and to delay purchase of equipment shouldthat proposal be adopted.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion  </ITAG>For the above reasons the FAA has determined that this action is not a``major rule'' under Executive Order 12291; and is a ``significant rule''under DOT Regulatory Policies and Procedures (44 FR 11034; February 26,1979). A full regulatory evaluation was prepared for the final rule inDocket No. 25304 and placed in the regulatory docket. This action to delaythe effective date of one part of that rule does not have any significanteffect on the information and conclusions contained in that evaluation.Accordingly, the existing regulatory evaluation remain valid and no futherevaluation is required. Also, for the reasons contained in the regulatoryevaluation in the docket, I certify that this action will not have a significantimpact on a substantial number of small entities under the criteria ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act.  <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Determination  </ITAG>The requirements proposed herein would not have a substantial direct effecton the states, on the relationship between the national government andthe states, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this proposal would not have sufficientfederalism implications to warrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 91  </ITAG>Aviation safety, Safety, Aircraft, Air traffic control, Pilots, Airspace,Air transportation, and Airports.  <ITAG tagnum="84">The Amendment  </ITAG>Accordingly, pursuant to the authority delegated to me, the Federal AviationAdministration amends Part 91 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFRPart 91) as follows:  <ITAG tagnum="52">PART 91_(AMENDED)  </ITAG>1.
