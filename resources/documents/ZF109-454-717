(local area networks, widearea networks)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bleackley, Beverley.andM;</AUTHOR><SUMMARY>Many large organizations are finding that the same gains that canbe made from connecting computers into a local area network (LAN)can be redoubled by connecting LANs and wide area networks (WAN)into enterprise-wide networks.andP;  The obstacles to creatingenterprise networks generally involve efforts to seamlesslyconnect diverse protocols, networks, leased lines and dial-inconnections with bridges.andP;  The premise behind an enterprisenetwork is that a user should be able to work at a microcomputerand be able to access data with a consistent user interface,regardless of whether the data is in the same building or acrossthe country.andP;  Large networks greatly improve efficiency andcommunications in an organization, allowing training manuals andother common documents to be stored, updated and accessed byanyone in the organization.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Topic:     Local Area NetworksWide Area NetworksEnterprise-Wide NetworksConnectivityTransparencyNetwork Architecture.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Enterprise networks link LANs to WANsandM;A new label has appeared on the communications scene LAN/WAN (local-areanetwork/wide-area network) connectivity signifies the capability to link LANswith wide area telecommunications channels to form enterprise wide networks.andM;With true LAN/WAN capabilities the key words are integration and transparencyEnterprise-wide networks are created by building bridges between diverselocal-area networks, X.25 packet networks leased lines or dial-in connectionsto provide access to distributed resources and data as though they wereresident on the user's own PC.andM;The resources might reside in a LAN server, PC, minicomputer or mainframe inthe same office, acorss the city or across the country.andP;  Actual locationbecomes unimportant.andP;  Sharing distributed resources and data among multiplelocations provides consistency and reliability in the acutal data used anddisseminated by each location.andP;  It also eliminates the need to maintainduplicate databases at individual sites.andM;&quot;This possibility allows for better resource and network managementthroughout an organization,&quot; says Bruce Attridge, director, Integrated OfficeSystems for Bell Canada.andM;&quot;Investment in existing LANs, desktop systems and software is protected.andO;Duplication of costly resources and peripherals can be minimized.andP;  Datastorage can be distributed to local networks, freeing valuable and oftencostly mainframe computing power for non-distributed specializedapplications.andP;  Two terminals on a desk, each with dedicated access to onlyone mainframe, become a thing of the past.andM;&quot;The LAN/WAN capability also provides greater user friendliness because theconnections from one local network to another become transparent to theuser.&quot;andM;He adds: &quot;The interface devices and software affect the connections andhandshakes between systems and eliminate the need for individual users tolearn complicated communications protocol structures.&quot;andM;Expanded electronic message and file exchange systems on an enterprise-widenetwork reduce the need for reliance on manual methods of transmitting ordelivering information Material, such as product information manuals oremployee guidelines, can be stored in databases and updated as required.andM;When the information is readily accessible on a network, notices can beelectronically &quot;mailed&quot; to everyone to inform them that updates on certainareas are now available.andM;Employees can access the data anywhere in the organziation to retrieveexactly the information they require at the moment.andP;  Electronic retrievalmethods permit users to use key words or page numbers to zero in on theinformation they are interested in, without having to thumb through largevolumes of data.andM;Current information is always available at the push of a button.andM;The LAN/WAN label may be relatively new in the marketplace but, from BellCanada's perspective, the capability has been present for sometimes, althoughpossibly in a different form or under a different name.andM;&quot;Historically, Bell Canada has been in the business of providing wide-areanetworks and is known for its capability to deliver reliable and secure dataand telecommunications,&quot; notes Attridge.andP;  &quot;The majority of the communicationsfacilities we offer are now digital with varying levels of connectivity tosuit the customer's needs.&quot;andM;Users with a need for a private, high-speed WAN can select a dedicated linkbetween two locations (Megaroute), or among several locations within the samemetropolitan area (Digital Channel Service) or multiple locations indifferent cities or provinces (Dataroute).andM;Where there is no requirement for a private WAN, there are severalalternatives in shared public networks to satisfy a wide variety of needs.andO;These include the nationwide Datapac packet communications network, CentrexData for city wide switched data transmission, and the Public SwitchedTelephone Network which transmits data as well as voice to any other locationserved by a telephone.andM;In the past four years, Bell Canada has branched out beyond basic cabling andwide-area network services to offer a variety of local-area networksolutions.andM;&quot;Bell Canada has built upon its overall communications experience to provideend-to-end connectivity in our LAN solutions,&quot; states Attridge.andM;&quot;We offer the customer a total package solution from wiring installation,through system configuration and installation, to after sales maintenance andsupport.andM;Many of today's LANs, including Ethernet, Token Ring and Appletalk useexisting unshielded twisted pair telephone wiring, fibre optics, plus modularjack terminations at workstations for ease of connection and placement.andM;&quot;This element of the solution has been a mainstay of our business for nearlya century,&quot; continues Attridge.andP;  &quot;The LAN software/hardware aspect is new forBell.andP;  However, rather than reinvent the wheel in this area, we haveapproached the computer industry for leading edge products from companiessuch as Banyan Systems, SynOptics Communications Inc., IBM and Retix.andP;  Wethen test and certify the products to ensure compatibility with our othercommunications services before integrating them into our LAN solutions.&quot;andM;Bell Canada's LAN systems are marketed under the company's Lanscapeconnectivity umbrella.andP;  With Lanscape, Bell Canada offers consultation andprovides wiring, equipment, connectivity and installation at the front end.andM;All products and services offered under this umbrella are tested andcertified by Bell to operte together efficiently and at optimum LAN/WANperformance levels and are fully maintained and supported by Bell Canada.andO;&quot;This provides customers with a high degree of confidence that our solutionwill function properly in their environment,&quot;  explains Attridge.andM;Users need to know that the chosen network solution will not only suitexisting needs but will provide unlimited future growth potential.andM;The ability to comply with today's standards and accommodate futuretechnologies and stanards as they become available is an importantconsideration of any network solution, be it LAN, WAN or both.andM;&quot;Prudent use of LAN/WAN capabilities by organizations could accelerate theevolution of the 'electronic cottage' that the industry has been talkingabout for the past decade,&quot; concludes Attridge.andM;&quot;Executives, sales representatives, clerical staff or any employee whogenerally works with computers can now access relevant corporate databasesand communicate with their offices from PCs or laptops at home or on theroad.andP;  And professionals such as doctors who generally work alone but have anaffiliation with a hospital or clinic are able to access the resources anddata of those institutions from their own offices to monitor the progress ofpatients, or share medical library resources or accounting functions.&quot;andM;Beverley Bleackley is a Toronto-based writer specializing in communicationsand high-technology subjects.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
