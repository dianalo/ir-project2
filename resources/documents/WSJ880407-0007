The offer continues a recent burst of takeover activity by Sir Ronald.    In a letter to Rothmans Holdings shareholders, Industrial Equity sought tender applications stating the number of shares that each holder is willing to sell and the price at which the holder will sell them. Offers will be accepted at the lowest prices necessary to acquire as many as 6.5 million shares.    On Sydney's stock exchange yesterday, Rothmans Holdings closed unchanged at 7.80 Australian dollars ($5.79), which values the entire company at 773 million dollars ($573.6 million). Industrial Equity fell two Australian cents, to 1.62 dollars.    An analyst speculated that the investment company might be testing the market to see whether Rothmans International is willing to sell its 50% stake. But in London, Rothmans International's executive deputy chairman, David Montagu, said that the British company &quot;is a happy shareholder&quot; in the Australian concern and that &quot;we don't intend to sell a single share under any circumstances.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
