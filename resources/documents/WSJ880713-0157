With thousands of inherited disorders awaiting cure, from sickle-cell anemia to muscular dystrophy, the lure has been strong. But despite big strides in commercial gene splicing that have yielded such products as the heart drug TPA, human gene transplants have remained a glimmer on the horizon.    Now the glimmer is taking form as a team of scientists at the National Institutes of Health presses an application to extend recombinant DNA technology from microbes, mice and monkeys to man.    Today, the NIH Biosafety Committee will review a proposed experiment by scientists from two NIH units: W. French Anderson of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and Steven Rosenberg and Michael Blaese of the National Cancer Institute. If it passes NIH safety muster, the experiment would face several more reviews, but final clearance for the trial -- the first legal gene transplant in humans -- could come as early as this fall.    Early on, scientists hoped the first human gene transplant could achieve a dramatic cure, since many diseases result from a single defective gene. But they have learned that transplanting a gene into a person isn't as easy as patching new genes into bacteria or yeast. A scientist from the University of California at Los Angeles performed unauthorized gene transplants overseas in a failed attempt to cure a genetic blood disorder.    Meanwhile, several groups researching severe combined immune deficiency (SCID), a congenital ailment made famous by a young boy in Texas who lived out his brief life in an aseptic bubble, have been plagued in laboratory work by the basic problems of getting the corrective gene into the right cells and making it function and endure.    The work continues on SCID and other inherited ills, but with sobered respect for its difficulty. &quot;The field went through an early period of naive optimism that things were going to be simple,&quot; says Theodore Friedmann, a pediatrics professor at the University of California at San Diego. &quot;We've since learned things aren't so straightforward.&quot;    The proposed NIH experiment doesn't aim to cure anything. Rather, it's a back-to-basics experiment, a technical trial of gene splicing in patients already receiving treatment in an experimental cancer program being conducted by Dr. Rosenberg. The goal is to see if a gene can be inserted into the right cells, stay there and function.    In the cancer program, Dr. Rosenberg is testing a form of therapy combining the growth promoter interleukin-2 (IL-2) and cancer-fighting, white blood cells called tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, or TILs. This involves removing a piece of tumor, mincing it and isolating the TILs. Then the scientists soak the isolated cells in IL-2 to grow massive quantities of TILs and infuse them in the patient's body, where they attack the tumor in greater force.    The gene transplant may help the researchers monitor the cancer trial. Dr. Blaese and his colleagues plan to implant a &quot;marker&quot; gene in the TIL cells that would enable scientists to track the cells' migration in the body back to the tumor site. Later the marker could be used as a hook to fish out the cancer-fighting cells and check their behavior in a test tube.    &quot;We'll see where the cells go in the body, and how long they live,&quot; says Dr. Blaese. &quot;Later, we'll examine them in the test tube and see if they're still behaving as (TILs).&quot;    If the gene transplant works, the lessons could be applied to future therapeutic experiments, Dr. Blaese says. &quot;We can see if we can soup them up (the cancer-fighting cells) to make them more effective,&quot; he says, perhaps by inserting a gene to manufacture substances like IL-2 to help fight the tumor.    Subjects in the gene-transplant experiment would be volunteers with advanced cancer and limited life expectancy who already have consented to the risks of the experimental cancer treatment. Scientists say these factors should ease ethical qualms.    Even so, safety issues at today's NIH meeting are likely to stir great public interest. Such interest is fanned by fear of the unknown and anxiety about eugenics -- a leap beyond curing disease to endowing people with specific traits. That, of course, is futuristic fantasy for now. But even in the case of a technical experiment, scientists appreciate the public's wariness.    &quot;Gene therapy is a sensitive issue to both the scientific community and to the public at large,&quot; says Richard O'Reilly, pediatrics chairman and leader of a genetherapy research program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. While assessing potential hazards is difficult, he says, &quot;I expect the risks to be extremely low.&quot;    Much of the debate probably will concern the proposed use of a cancer virus, the Moloney mouse leukemia virus, as a vehicle to deposit the marker gene into the cancer patients' cells. The Moloney virus isn't known to cause disease in humans. Moreover, it is crippled -- stripped of its native genes -- to keep it from spreading.    Still, the developer of this carrier-virus, Eli Gilboa of Memorial Sloan-Kettering, says that even though the virus is crippled, certain precautions are necessary. &quot;It is important to ascertain that the viral stocks used are free from helper viruses,&quot; he says, referring to stray viruses that exist in nature like a traveling stock of spare parts to repair crippled neighboring viruses. A helper potentially could restore a crippled lab virus to full virulence. Dr. Blaese says studies he has done show that the crippled virus in the stocks he would use isn't replicating and is free of such virulent helpers.    Unpublished animal studies of the test's safety show that both healthy and immune-suppressed monkeys given huge doses of Moloney virus show &quot;no ill effects,&quot; Dr. Blaese says. &quot;And I don't anticipate any.&quot; It is unusual for scientists to proceed to human tests before animal studies are completed. But Dr. Blaese says he expects to finish the animal tests by October, when the proposal would go before the full NIH Recombinant DNA Advisory Committee.    Once the gene is inserted in the human TIL cells, another safety check would be made. Dr. Blaese says the team would observe the cells in the test tube before reinfusing them into cancer patients &quot;to make sure insertion of the gene doesn't make them grow abnormally&quot; like a cancer cell. &quot;We think chances of this are incredibly tiny,&quot; he adds.    Some specialists say an extra level of safety would be desirable but is technically unfeasible. &quot;The only thing that would make me feel better about (the NIH experiment) would be to put in a second marker gene as a fail-safe, to allow you to kill all the cells of that lineage at will if something went wrong,&quot; one researcher says. But he and other scientists acknowledge that such techniques haven't been perfected yet.    &quot;You'd like something to shut the system off,&quot; Dr. Blaese says. But so far, he adds, &quot;we don't have one that functions.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
