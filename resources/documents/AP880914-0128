While endorsing a number of weapons programs, Dukakis alsoreiterated his opposition to several favored by Reagan andRepublican presidential nominee George Bush, including therail-based MX missile, and he expressed anew his concern that theB-1 bomber would be unable to perform the job for which it wasdesigned.   Dukakis said he favored continued research on a strategicdefense system but at about $1 billion a year, far below whatReagan wants to spend on the so-called Star Wars system. Dukakisalso said that while he agreed in concept with the Midgetmanmissile he was not convinced the costly program was needed tomodernize the land-based U.S. nuclear deterrent.   Dukakis repeated his promise to make improved conventionalforces his top defense priority if he is elected and said hefavored rapid development of new tanks and anti-tank weapons, theAdvanced Tactical Fighter, the SS-21 Sea Wolf fast-attack submarineand new weapons to fight Soviet submarines.   He also reiterated his backing of the Trident II submarine-basedmissile system, the Stealth bomber and advanced cruise missiles.   ``We're not going to have a laundry list of weapons systems,''Dukakis said. ``We're going to have a strategy for keeping Americastrong.''   Later, at a rally in Annapolis, Md., before heading home toBoston, the Democratic nominee taunted Bush for refusing to agreeto a presidential debate originally scheduled for tonight in theMaryland capital.   ``If George Bush isn't ready today after more than seven and ahalf years as vice president of this country, how can we expect himto be ready on Jan. 20, 1989?'' Dukakis asked. ``Lloyd Bentsen andI are ready.''   He jokingly suggested that the reason Bush refused to come tothe home of the U.S. Naval Academy was ``that his idea of a navalexercise is throwing his campaign advisers overboard.'' That was areference to the recent resignation of six officials of a pro-Bushethnic campaign organization who allegedly had pro-Nazi oranti-Semitic ties.   At Georgetown University, Dukakis accused Bush of playingpolitics by convincing Reagan to veto a defense authorization billrecently passed with bipartisan support in Congress and said theveto had prevented an expanded role for the Coast Guard in the waron drugs and long-overdue pay and benefit increases for militaryforces.   ``My friends, we can't play politics with our nationalsecurity,'' Dukakis said.   He promised to work diligently toward new arms control measuresand a nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union but also saidhe would demand significant cutbacks in Soviet conventional forcesin Europe and call for the dismantling of the Soviets' SS-18missiles.   Despite spending billions on defense, Dukakis said the Reaganadministration has done little to improve the nation's security.   ``The fact is that the Republicans promised in 1980 to make ourland-based missiles invulnerable and, today, after another $25billion and eight years of Republican mismanagement, our ICBMs aremore vulnerable that they were in 1980.''   Dukakis said he was committed to the traditional triad of U.S.defense policy: land-, air- and sea-based strategic capacities. Buthe said Bush had shown no cohesion in his priorities and has failedto discuss the Pentagon procurement scandal.   ``We have what you might call a new type of Republican triadtoday: waste, duplication and fraud,'' he said.   Dukakis also said that as commander-in-chief he would not shyaway from using military force if necessary.   ``We'll use force when it's necessary to protect our territory,our citizens or vital interests; to meet our treaty commitments,and to deter or respond to terrorist attacks,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
