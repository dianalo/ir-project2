The heliocentric radial gradient of proton temperature tendsto decrease in high-speed regions owing to heat generation accompaniedby a velocity increase of more than 50 km s{sup -1} per hour. Temperaturemeasurements in the region with decreasing or nearly constant flow velocityreveal cooling which is still slower than the adiabatic case. The remnantdifference suggests the existence of another heating mechanism for protons,especially in a low-speed stream.</TEXT></DOC>
