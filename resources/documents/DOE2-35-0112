<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-35-0112 </DOCNO><TEXT>Nucleon-induced fission cross sections determined from a statistical preequilibriummodel are used in conjunction with a new scission-point model of fissionfragment mass, charge and excitation energy distributions to produceevaporation model calculations of particle and gamma spectra and multiplicitiesfrom fission. Comparisons are made to experiment for the 14.5-MeV neutron-inducedfission of {sup 238}U. In addition, calculated particle and gamma spectrawill be compared with the ENDF/B library for 2- and 5-MeV neutron-inducedfission of {sup 235}U and {sup 238}U, respectively. Initial predictionsfor these same quantities for proton-induced fission reactions at energiesup to 100 MeV will be presented and discussed. 6 refs., 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
