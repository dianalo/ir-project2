Smith, professor of industrial engineering at the University ofWisconsin (Madison), dismisses the study as &quot;too little, too late.&quot;andP;  He addsthat NIOSH has not started any new VDT research .andP;  &quot;[Government] research hasgone down the tubes,&quot; he says.andM;However, after a long delay, the National Institute of Health recently fundeda four-year, $2 million Mt. Sinai School of Medicine study of the effects ofVDTs and othe roffice equipment on 8,000 female office workers.andP;  In addition,the Kaiser Permanente Medical Care Program is starting a two- to three-yearstudy, in cooperation with the California Department of Health Services,which will, among other things, look at the effects of electromagnetic fieldson pregnancy outcomes.andP;  Overseas epidmiological studies include a researcheffort on VDT use in Great Britain.andP;  Researchers are studying approximately8,000 women and are scheduled to complete the study this year.andM;Media coverage of the possible VDT health hazards is also increasing.andP;  In acontroversial series of three articles published in The New Yorker last June,Paul Brodeur, a journalist who covers public health issues for that magazine,chronicled--and stirred up--the movement to gather more information onpossible radiation health hazards.andM;Unnecessary exposureandM;Brodeur took no prisoners.andP;  The thrust of his encyclopedic coverage was thatthrough a massive cover-up and malfeasance by public and industry officials,scientists, the U.S.andP;  military, and even the press, millions of Americans arebeing unnecessarily exposed to potential health hazards from low-levelelectromagnetic radiation that has become almost ubiquitous in our society.andO;This radiation comes from the alternating current produced bypower-distribution transformers located near homes, from certain types ofU.S.andP;  Air Force radar installations, from electric blankets, and from thecathode ray tubes (CRTs) in millions of VDTs.andM;Brodeur concluded that low-frequency magnetic radiation from VDTs might behazardous to the reproductive process and biologically harmful in the sameway that the radiation from electrical power lines might be contributing tohigher-than-normal incidences of cancer in children living near them.andM;The troublesome phrase in all of these cases is &quot;might be.&quot;andP;  Brodeur calledfor research to find out for sure.andP;  Most of the VDT-oriented research so farhas focused on reproductive problems--spontaneous abortions and defectivefetuses.andP;  This bothers radiation activist Louis Slesin, who thinks the cancerconnection in particular has been given short shrift.andP;  &quot;Brodeur doesn't sayyou're going to get cancer,&quot; Slesin says, &quot;but he raises questions that needto be answered.andP;  Nobody's picking up on that.&quot;andM;Slesin, who figures prominently in Brodeur's writings, publishes a bimontlynewsletter on VDT health and safety called VDT News (P.O.andP;  Box 1799, GrandCentral Station, New York, NY 10163; $87 per year).andP;  He is particularlyconcerned about the lack of basic research.andP;  &quot;the real problem at the momentis that there have been no systematic measurements made of VDT radiation,&quot;Slesin says.andP;  &quot;We're not playing with a full deck when it comes to basicdata.&quot;andM;Many kinds of electrical equipment, including home appliances with motors inthem, such as hair dryers and electric food mixers, produce radiation.andO;Whether it's dangerous depends on what kind of radiation it is, how strong itis, and how long you are exposed to it.andP;  Ionizing waves, such as X-rays, candamage living cells.andP;  The cathode ray tube in a VDT produces some X-rays, butexperts agree that the glass screen of a properly operating CRT blocks theserays.andP;  That means X-rays from the screen won't cause cataracts or otherradiation-induced eye damage.andM;Many forms of radiationandM;Until recently it was thought that nonionizing radiation, which includesbroadcast radio and TV signals, was benign and could bathe us constantly withno ill effects.andP;  VDT concern now centers on this nonionizing radiation atvery low frequency (VLF) and extremely low frequency (ELF) levels.andP;  Monitorsemit radiation, mostly from the backs of their cabinets, at both frequencies:VLF from the flyback transformer that moves the electron beam horizontallyacross the screen at about 15,000 to 30,000 cycles per second (Hz), and ELFfrom the vertical deflection coils that refresh the screen at a rate of 55 to75 Hz, or 55 to 75 times per second.andP;  This &quot;pulsed&quot; radiation--waves that areemitted in cyclic bursts rather than continuously--is causing the mostconcern.andM;As recently as a decade ago, the conventional wisdom in the scientificcommunity was that nonionizing radiation could cause damage only by raisingthe temperature of biological cells.andP;  Examples of this phenomenon are theinfrared and ultraviolet rays from a heat lamp that burn your skin if youexpose youself to them too long and a microwave oven that cooks food withhigh frequency waves.andP;  Thus, the &quot;safe&quot; exposure threshold for this kind ofradiation was set at power intensities far above the levels produced by aVDT.andP;  Then it was learned that weak, low-frequency, pulsed magnetic fieldswith intensities as low as two or three milligauss (units of magneticinduction) can interfere with cell functions, and the door was opened to anew range of concerns--and research.andM;In early September the Second International Conference on Work with DisplayUnits, held in Montreal, highlighted the latest scientific findings in theVDT controversy.andP;  Good news for VDT users came in the form of preliminaryresults from a large laboratory study of mice done at the University ofToronto.andP;  There was no significant difference in the rate of spontaneousabortions between control mice and those exposed to various intensities ofVLF electromagnetic radiation at a frequency of 20 KHz.andM;Further research requiredandM;Seizing on the Toronto study as further proof that VDT radiation isn'tharmful, Linden Heck, executive director of the Center of Office Technology(COT), a New York-Based VDT trade group, points out that research has yet toturn up any &quot;demonstrable link&quot; between VDTs and radiation hazards.andP;  &quot;Ofcourse,&quot; she says, &quot;further research ought to be done.&quot;andM;The Toronto mouse study, which was sponsored by IBM and Ontario Hydro, theCanadian hydroelectric utility, was received with more caution by researchersat the session.andP;  &quot;The Toronto study looks good,&quot; says Dianne Berthelette,general secretary of the conference.andP;  &quot;But now I need to study the report.andO;And I'll have to wait for the rest of the report on fetal malformations&quot;[which was published in November 1989].andP;  Berthelette is a professor in theDepartment of Administrative Sciences at the University of Quebec, inMontreal.andM;The VDT radiation question is, of course, a very emotional one.andP;  And,unfortunately, much of the research has been flawed by biases, either on thepart of the researcher or because of certain limitations built into thestudy.andM;The 2,500-woman NIOSH epidemiological study now nearing completion is anexample of the latter.andP;  This study compares telephone operators who work withVDTs with telephone operators who don't use terminals.andP;  This study has beencriticized because of alleged &quot;meddling&quot; by the Reagan administration, whichrequired NIOSH to drop certain questions about fertility and stress.andP;  LouisSlesin of VDT NEws believes the changes are serious flaws in the study.andP;  &quot;Ifit turns up anything positive, it will only point to the need for anothersuty,&quot; he says.andM;Teresa Schnorr, director of the study, disagrees.andP;  Unlike the first Kaiserstudy, which was designed for a different purpose, &quot;our study will actuallybe able to calculate how many hours a woman sat in front of a VDT in herfirst trimester of pregnancy,&quot; she says.andP;  &quot;If there is a relationship, weshould be able to see it.&quot;andM;The NIOSH study also samples ionizing radition, static electricity,electro-magnetic fields, and body currents from two different models of VDT'sused by the operators.andP;  But Schnorr concedes that the questions on fertilityshe had to omit &quot;will make it easier to criticize the results&quot; and also willmake the study less valuable than it might have been.andM;Unlike the Kaiser and NIOSH studies, which were &quot;retrospective&quot; in that theyasked women about previous VDT use and relied on personal recall, the Mt.andO;Sinai study is a &quot;prospective,&quot; or forward-looking investigation that willtrack the effects of different levels of smoking, alcohol, and VDT use on8,000 female office workers in their child-bearing years.andP;  Although VDTradiation isn't a primary focus, it is a significant aspect of the study.andO;The population will be selected, with the help of various union and employeegroups, from among office workers located in Cleveland, Boston, New York, andone yet-to-be-named city in California.andP;  It wll take four years to complete.andM;Reducing the riskandM;Although the rate of research is accelerating, uncovering the facts is stilla long-term proposition.andP;  In the meantime, what should you do if you work ata VDT?andP;  Remember, it is chronic exposure--four hours or more a day--that isof concern, not occasional use.andM;In a situation where VDTs &quot;may or may not be the problem, we should removethe risk,&quot; says Sharon Danaan, research director for the organization 9 to 5,National Association of Working Women.andP;  9 to 5 urges pregnant office workersto try to arrange for half-time work on VDTs.andP;  VDT News publisher Slesinadvises people to turn off their VDTs when they are not actually using them.andO;Because all radiation falls off sharply with distance, Slesin recommendssitting three feet from any monitor, including those of your coworkers.andM;Why not just shield the radiation?andP;  A cottage &quot;shielding&quot; industry has sprungup for just that purpose.andP;  Some companies offer screen shields and othersoffer lead aprons that are supposed to protect users from radiation.andO;Unfortunately, neither is effective, and the weight of the aprons may beharmful to a pregnancy.andM;Electrical fields can be shielded by grounded screen shields, and weak X-rayscan be stopped by lead aprons.andP;  But unlike X-rays, which travel in a straightline, low-frequency magnetic waves pass through and around most metals,including lead.andP;  Even the &quot;shielded&quot; monitors that IBM and other VDTproducers make primarily for the Swedish market do only part of the job; forthe most part, they shield VLF but not ELF radiation.andP;  No one makes an ELFshield.andM;Alternatives in shieldingandM;That's why an enterprising Massachusetts firm has produced a replacementmonitor that emits no radiation at all.andP;  George Lechter, president of SafeComputing (Needham, Mass.; 800-222-3003), argues that three feet is still tooclose to be totally safe.andP;  His solution is a completely shieldedliquid-crystal screen that emits zero radiation.andP;  Unmodified LCD screens,such as those found on portable computers, emit some electric and magnegitradiation, but not as much as a CRT.andP;  The $695 black-and-white screen isn'tquite as sharp as a CRT, but Lechter says he's sold more than 3,500 of themsince they came on the market last spring.andP;  Customers include state andfederal government agencies.andM;Another alternative is the black-and-white Macintosh.andP;  Lechter says the Macemits one third the radiation of regular monitors, probably because of itssmaller size.andM;If you want to measure just your VDT or power-line radiation levels, Lechterwill sell you the Safe Meter for $145 (or rent it to you for $39.95 a week).andO;What you do after you get those readings is up to you.andM;If you believe IBM and the Center for Office Technology, you'll do nothing.andO;Both of these organizations declare unequivocably that scientific researchdoes not and has never shown there to be any danger from VDT radiation.andM;Professor Smith of the University of Wisconsin isn't that convinced, but hefeels more strongly now that he did a year ago that the problems that existare more likely due to workplace stress factors than to radiation.andP;  In anycase, for those who remain concerned, he had calculated an interesting pairof risk factors in terms of the likelihood of a bad reproductive outcome fora woman: For a woman using a VDT, the risk ratio is 1.5 to 1.andP;  For a womanwho smokes, the risk ratio is 8 to 1.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
