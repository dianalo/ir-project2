The Commerce Department said Thursday that sales increased $632million last month to a seasonally adjusted $134.0 billion. Therise followed increases of 0.4 percent in June and 0.8 percent inMay.   ``Retail sales were on the soft side in July,'' said AllenSinai, chief economist of the Boston Co. ``Where there wereincreases, they were just moderate. However, coming after so stronga second quarter ... some pause in growth should not be suprising.''   At the White House, presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwatercalled the report ``good news'' and said the statistics ``indicatea steadily growing economy.''   Sinai and other economists said sales should continue toincrease through the third quarter because of strong job growth,but they warned that consumer spending will soften eventually asinterest rates creep higher.   Several of the nation's largest banks raised their prime lendingrate a half percentage point to 10 percent on Thursday, just twodays after the Federal Reserve boosted its key lending rate.   It was the third increase this year in the prime rate, on whichmany consumer loan rates are based, and pushed it to its highestlevel in three years.   Bruce Steinberg, an economist with Merrill Lynch, said thegrowing popularity of adjustable rate home mortgages and homeequity loans, most of them fluctuating with the prime rate, meansmore households are pinched by rising rates than in the past.   ``A large group of people are about to experience a squeeze ontheir cash flow and as we move into the last part of the year thatshould effect consumer spending,'' Steinberg said.   Sales last month were led by a 1.9 percent jump at automotivedealers to $30.1 billion, the biggest climb since February, whenauto sales shot up 2.0 percent. Automotive sales had climbed amodest 0.4 percent in June.   Excluding autos, sales were up a scant 0.1 percent in July.   The strongest category other than autos was clothing stores,where sales jumped 1.6 percent after a 0.6 percent rise in June.   However, David Levy of Levy Economic Forecasts in Chappaqua,N.Y., noted that the government does not adjust retail salesfigures for inflation. He said strength in autos and clothing atleast partly reflected higher prices.   The number of autos sold, as reported separately by the CommerceDepartment, was the same last month as in June. Levy said autodealers, who generally have had strong sales this year, are notdiscounting as heavily as in past years. Thus, after seasonaladjustments, sales figures rose.   Levy said apparel sales also look stronger than they normallywould because of price increases earlier this year. However, heattributed some of the strength to consumers postponing purchasesof summer clothing from May, when the weather was unseasonablycool, to June and July.   Sales at department and other general merchandise stores, helpedby hot weather-related buying, were up a slight 0.2 percent to$15.2 billion in July after a strong 1.4 percent increase a monthearlier.   Sales of durable goods, ``big ticket'' items expected to lastthree or more years, were up 0.7 percent, solely on the strength ofautos. Hardware and building supply stores reported a 1.8 percentdrop in sales last month, while sales at furniture stores were off1.0 percent.   Sales of non-durable goods, led by specialty clothing stores,were up 0.4 percent.   There were gains of 0.6 percent at food and grocery stores,caused mostly by price increases rather than an increase in salesvolume, and 0.2 percent at restaurants and bars.   Drug stores reported a 1.0 percent drop in July sales, whilegasoline stations reported a 0.2 percent decline.   Overall sales for the first seven months of the year were 6.5percent greater than the same period in 1987, about two percentagepoints above the rate of inflation.</TEXT></DOC>
