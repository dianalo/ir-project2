General</ITAG>On August 9, 1989, the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery, and EnforcementAct of 1989 (``FIRREA'') was enacted into law. Among other things, theFIRREA added section 21B to the Federal Home Loan Bank Act (the ``Act'')which established a corporation known as the Resolution Funding Corporation(``Funding Corporation'') to provide funds necessary for the ResolutionTrust Corporation (``RTC'') to carry out its purpose under FIRREA.<ITAG tagnum="84">B. Staff</ITAG>Section 21B(c)(6)(A) of the Act provides that the Funding Corporation shallhave no paid employees. However, the Act authorizes the Funding CorporationDirectorate, with the approval of the Board, to authorize the officers,employees, or agents of the banks to act for and on behalf of the FundingCorporation. Section 21B(c)(6)(B). The regulations adopted today providethe Board's approval for the officers, employees, or agents of the banksto act for and on behalf of the Funding Corporation.<ITAG tagnum="84">C. Industry Assessments</ITAG>Section 21B(e)(7) of the Act authorizes the Funding Corporation, with theapproval of the Board of Directors of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation(``FDIC''), to collect assessments from SAIF members. The Oversight Board,established pursuant to section 21A(a)(1) of the Act, is promulgating regulationsimplementing the Funding Corporation's assessment authority, and the FDIChas adopted regulations setting forth the manner in which such assessmentsshall be collected. <T3>See </T3>12 CFR part 327 and 12 CFR part 1510. The FDIC's and the OversightBoard's regulations adopted today merely provide that the banks shall allowSAIF members to establish and maintain a demand deposit account at theappropriate bank in order to assist in the collection of the Funding Corporation'sassessment of SAIF members through a direct debit system.<ITAG tagnum="84">D. Administrative Procedure Act</ITAG>The Board is adopting this regulation as a final rule September 20, 1989.The Board finds that, for its adoption of these rules, observance of thenotice and comment procedures, prescribed by the Administrative ProceduresAct, 5 U.S.C. 553 (1982) and 12 CFR 508.11 and 508.12 (1987), may be waivedpursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(B) and 5 U.S.C. 553(d)(3).The Board for good cause finds that notice and comment procedures are impracticable,unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest for its adoption of thesebank assistance rules (12 CFR part 955). The reasons in support of thisfinding are as follows.First, the Board is of the view that notice and comment procedures areunnecessary because the rules set forth in part 955, as added today, generallyonly permit employees of the banks to assist the Funding Corporation asprovided by FIRREA. The new rules impose no new legal burdens; they merelypermit the officers or employees of the banks or the banks' joint officeto assist the Funding Corporation. The rules also permit the banks to assistin the collection of the Funding Corporation's assessment of SAIF members.Providing notice and comment procedures and delayed effective date wouldbe contrary to the public interest because the Board could not immediatelypermit these employees to assist the Funding Corporation, which must assessthe banks for $1.2 billion by September 30, 1989.Secondly, the Board believes that it is contrary to the public interestto have the adoption of the rules delayed in order to provide for suchnotice and comment procedures. The Board finds that it is in the publicinterest for the Funding Corporation to commence its operations at theearliest possible opportunity. Successful operation of the Funding Corporationis necessary to restore public confidence in the nation's depository institutionsand will enable the Oversight Board and the RTC to meet their obligationsunder FIRREA.Finally, the Board finds that these regulations relate to agency managementwithin the meaning of 5 U.S.C. 553, and are therefore exempt from the noticeand comment provisions set forth therein.<ITAG tagnum="84">E. Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>Because no notice of proposed rulemaking is required for this regulation,the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) do not apply.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 955 </ITAG>Federal home loan banks, Resolution Funding Corporation, Savings associations.Accordingly, the Board hereby amends title 12, chapter IX, Code of FederalRegulations by adding part 955 in subchapter D, as set forth below <ITAG tagnum="72">SUBCHAPTER D_RESOLUTION FUNDING CORPORATION </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 955_AUTHORITY FOR BANK ASSISTANCE </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="70">Sec. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">955.1 Bank employees </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">955.2 Demand deposit accounts</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Authority: </T4>Sec. 702, Pub.
