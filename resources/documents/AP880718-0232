(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   William Barklow has been eavesdroppingon a 25-million-year-old conversation nobody fully understands,using modern techniques in an effort to solve the mystery of theloons.   ``We know very little about them,'' said Barklow, a FraminghamState College biology professor who has spent more than 14 yearsstudying the elusive member of the duck family. ``We don't know howlong they live. We don't know how many there are. There's a lot ofunanswered questions.''   Barklow travels the northern New England woods from spring untilwinter, recording the calls of male loons. Female loons are silent.   He theorizes that loons have a system of communication whichincludes the ``yodel'' and the ``laugh,'' the latter a warning toflee from danger.   The recorded yodels, believed to be signals of aggression, areconverted to voice prints to track and identify the loons, whichare difficult to catch and band since they spend virtually theirwhole lives on water.   ``In this way there is no intrusion. If you band a loon, youmust catch it. This way, they are not disturbed,'' Barklow said,adding that only a few naturalists use ``voice'' patterns to trackanimals.   Since each male loon's call is slightly different, he can matchthe voice prints to make identifications. One loon he tracked hasbeen returning to a northern Maine lake for 9{ years afterwintering in the Atlantic Ocean.   In addition to helping determine lifespan and numbers, the voicepatterns could give insights into behavior and the effects ofchemical contamination, he said. ``They are very sensitive to humandevelopment. In some cases they've been chased by boats on lakes.They really like to be left undisturbed.''   The four species of loons range around the world in northernlatitudes. They are plentiful in the arctic but threatened in thesouthern edge of their habitat, such as Maine and central NewHampshire, said Barklow, who has tracked loons as far south asWalden Pond in Massachusetts.   Barklow has put out pleas from New England to Alaska forrecordings of yodels, and is studying two baby loons in NewHampshire to determine how the calls are learned. ``All this takesa very long time,'' he said.   Meanwhile, the reclusive loons have become quite a sensation,Barklow said. ``There's something very haunting and ethereal aboutthe calls.''   An album of calls he recorded in the 1970s has sold nearly90,000 copies. Calls also have been used in a production by the SanFrancisco Ballet, the film ``On Golden Pond,'' and an upcomingmovie, ``The Far North,'' by Sam Shepard.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for July 21</NOTE></DOC>
