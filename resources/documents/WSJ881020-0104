The systems will comprise personal computers made by Compaq Computer Corp. of Houston and a version of American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s Unix developed by Santa Cruz Operation Inc. of Santa Cruz, Calif.    Unix has been growing in popularity as an office-computer operating system because it enables computers to handle several computing tasks simultaneously and allows several people to share the same computer. Until recently, however, most Unix computers handled engineering and technical tasks rather than conventional business tasks.    ComputerLand will be competing with Tandy Corp.'s Radio Shack chain of computer stores, which sells similar systems based on its own personal computers. Also, Businessland Inc. of San Jose, Calif., has said it will begin selling office computer systems using Unix sometime next year. </TEXT></DOC>
