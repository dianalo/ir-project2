Beazer, the British construction firm that agreed to acquireKoppers last month for $1.81 billion, is expected to announce apreliminary agreement by Tuesday, according to The New York Times.   Brian Beazer, who heads the company, announced before the mergeragreement was signed that he intended to sell Koppers' chemical andallied products division. The Times said the division accounted forabout 40 percent of the Pittsburgh-based company's $1.5 billion inrevenue last year.   Under terms of the merger agreement, Beazer granted Koppersmanagement 45 days to draw up a buyout plan before he offered theunit to other potential purchasers. That period was then extendeduntil Aug. 5.   In a leveraged buyout, investors borrow heavily to buy a companyand then pay off debt with the target company's cash flow or thesale of its assets.   Sterling Group, a Houston-based investment bank run by Gordon A.Cain, will provide financing for the buyout, the paper said.   Cain, according to the Times, has played a major role in recentyears in reviving troubled companies in the refining and chemicalindustries. In April, Cain sold Cain Chemical Co. to OccidentalPetroleum Corp. for $1.25 billion in cash and the assumption of $1billion in debt.   The Times said the involvement of Cain is likely to give thedeal considerable credibility in the chemical industry.</TEXT></DOC>
