This involves, among other possibilities,the development of plants resistant and/or tolerant to air pollutants,with a concomitant understanding of the effects of specific toxic gaseson basic metabolic processes. Such a plant genetics capability was initiatedat LLNL with Departmental IRandamp;D funding. 10 refs., 7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
