One person was killed and nine injured this week in rioting overland reform in the South Pacific tax-haven nation and offshorebanking center.   The Foreign Ministry advised tourists not to visit Vanuatu andthe Defense Ministry ordered the warships Stalwart and Jervis Bayto extend training exercises in the area and be prepared for apossible evacuation.   Prime Minister Bob Hawke repeated his statement that Libya waslinked to Monday's rioting in the Vanuatu capital, Port Vila, butoffered no proof. Libya denied involvement.   News reports said about 750 Australians, residents and visitors,were in Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides. The mainlyMelanesian island nation of 130,000 people is roughly 1,400 milesnortheast of Sydney.   Monday's demonstration turned violent when a mob marched onPrime Minister Walter Lini's office. Demonstrators looted shops andsmashed office windows, causing an estimated $1 million in damage,Radio Vanuatu reported today.   The radio said villagers involved in the demonstration had begunsurrendering to police. It gave no details. One demonstrator waskilled when a police vehicle ran over him. Police arrested 30people.   Within hours of the trouble, Australia and New Zealand flewsupplies of riot control gear to Vanuatu at Lini's request.   Australia's Foreign Ministry said today that there was apossibility of a confrontation this weekend between Lini and thegeneral secretary of his governing Vanu'uka Parti.   Australian media reports said the general secretary, Barak Sope,was behind Monday's demonstration and Hawke said a number of peoplearound Sope ``have actually been trained in Libya and that is amatter of concern.''   Sope last year tried unsuccessfully to gain leadership ofVanuatu, asserting Lini was unfit for the job after suffering adebilitating stroke.   Vanuatu rattled the nerves of generally pro-Western SouthPacific nations with its 1986 decision to establish diplomatic tieswith Libya and the Soviet Union. Since then, Sope's supporters havevisited Libya for what diplomats here described as unspecifiedtraining.   On Thursday, Libya's state-run JANA news agency quoted anunidentified Libyan Foreign Minitry official in Tripoli as denyingHawke's charges.   Vanuatu was administered jointly by Britain and France from 1906until 1980, when it achieved independence.</TEXT></DOC>
