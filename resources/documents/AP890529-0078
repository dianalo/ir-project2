WILLIAMS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The troop cuts proposed Monday byPresident Bush pull together the ranks of NATO for its owndisarmament offensive and shelve disunity in the alliance overshort-range nuclear missiles.   The split between the United States and Britain, on the oneside, and West Germany and many others of the 16 alliance membersover the short-range missiles had stalled a coordinated NATOresponse to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's armsinitiatives.   But, for the sake of a united Western effort to seize momentumfrom the Kremlin, West Germany appears now to have put aside itsnuclear grievance.   The European allies of the United States hailed Bush's call forequal ceilings on NATO and Warsaw Pact troop levels in Europe.   British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Bush's proposalhad ``transformed the summit.'' Spanish Foreign Minister FrancisoFernandez Ordonez said Bush had given a new impetus to conventionalarms talks in Vienna.   Even West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl hailed the proposal as a``great initiative'' and said his first priority was that thesummit ``be a success.''   Bush's move does little to resolve the contentious dispute overwhen and whether the superpowers should take Gorbachev up on hisrequest to negotiate on short-range nuclear missiles deployed inEurope.   But Monday's proposal does offer a face-saving alternative forthe Bonn leadership and could set the superpowers on the tracktoward substantial cuts in the number of soldiers deployed inEurope by both military blocs.   Gorbachev has pushed for reducing the military presence of bothEast and West to minimum levels, and earlier this month said hewould be willing to go along with ceilings on troop strength.   If accepted by both alliances, Bush's proposal would remove atleast 325,000 Soviet soldiers from Europe and at least 30,000American troops, or _ in all _ about 40 percent of the superpowers'combined European forces.   It would also set ceilings on tanks, armored personnel carriersand artillery pieces, and open negotiations to limit combataircraft and helicopters across Europe.   Pressured by a populace eager to take the Soviet leader at hisword, West German leaders had until Monday insisted that the UnitedStates agree to the Soviet call for short-range missilenegotiations.   Most of NATO's short-range nuclear weapons arsenal is based inWest Germany, where anti-nuclear sentiments have been gainingground since the 1987 superpower treaty calling for the destructionof all intermediate-range nuclear missiles.   As the medium-range rockets have been removed, NATO has shiftedto West Germany the burden of retaining a nuclear response optionto repel a possible attack by the Warsaw Pact's superiorconventional forces.   NATO leaders announced soon after beginning their two-daymeeting that the short-range missile issue was being shunted into aspecial working group, an apparent effort to focus attention onBush's troop cut initiative on which the allies all agree.   West German government spokesman Hans Klein told reporters thecommittee had been established ``to keep the short-range issue fromdominating the summit.''   In his opening address at the summit, Kohl praised Bush'sproposal but reiterated his government's push for talks on theshort-range nuclear weapons systems.   ``President Bush has today paved the way for further success ofour alliance,'' Kohl declared. ``I congratulate him on thisfar-sighted step.''   Then, invoking the words of John F. Kennedy, Kohl added:   ``Let us never negotiate out of fear. But let us never fear tonegotiate.''   Asked at a news conference whether short-range weapons talkscould be expected in the future, Bush replied, ``After agreementwas reached and after some implementation (of conventional forcereductions), yes.''   It was not immediately clear how long Kohl's coalition partners,especially liberal Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, wouldbe willing to put off resolution of the nuclear issue.   Genscher and Kohl are known to be divided on how far WestGermany should push the short-range issue. They arrived separatelyfor the summit, and their delegations are even in different hotels.   Bush's troop cut proposal is unlikely to suppress the growingWest German popular movement for reductions in the short-rangemissiles stockpiles.   But it may ease West Germans' concerns about the more than400,000 foreign troops in their country whose maneuvers andlow-flying training exercises have stirred widespread protest.</TEXT></DOC>
