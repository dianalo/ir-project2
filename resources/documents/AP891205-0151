The human rights activist and the others have not publicizedtheir idea of calling a strike of one or two hours in the weekbefore the next session of the Congress of People's Deputies.   Six legislators proposed it at a meeting of the Inter-RegionalDeputies Group, an organization of several hundred legislators whofavor faster and more radical reforms. They hope to put thequestion of rescinding Article 6 of the constitution on the agendawhen the Congress convenes Dec. 12.   Article 6 makes the party the ``leading and guiding force ofSoviet society,'' in effect guaranteeing it a power monopoly.   Poland, Hungary, East Germany and Czechoslovakia have removedsimilar provisions from their constitutions.   Early last month, the Supreme Soviet, the working legislaturewithin the Congress, voted on a proposal to put the question on thelarger body's agenda. It lost by a narrow margin.   Vice President Anatoly I. Lukyanov said Tuesday: ``The Congressis the highest body in the country and can take a decision onwhatever it wants. They can do as they see fit.''   The Congress is the centerpiece of President Mikhail S.Gorbachev's political reforms. Its 2,250 deputies were chosen inMarch in the first competitive elections in more than 70 years.   Lukyanov told a news briefing the Congress agenda, as approvedby the Supreme Soviet, will include the economy, changes inelection laws and a report on what is being done against organizedcrime.   He said ``the economy is the major item'' and a report onefforts to stabilize and improve it will be be delivered by PremierNikolai Ryzhkov, with four days set aside for debate.   The first Congress session began May 25 and was televised liveevery day for two weeks, but Lukyanov said the next will be shownonly in the evening, on tape. He said hundreds of thousands ofworkers stayed home last time to watch, and 20 percent ofproduction was lost.</TEXT></DOC>
