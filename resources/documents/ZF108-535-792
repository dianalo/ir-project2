 The price makes this program worthwhile, andalthough not a perfect product it is nonetheless very useful anddeserves consideration.andP;  Query 2.2 supports many SQL commands toquery dBase files and can show the results as either tables,graphs, or histograms.andP;  Creating graphical representations of datais where Query excels.andP;  The program can generate bar, stacked barand pie charts, and allows text to be embedded in the graphics.andO;Query also allows users to store queries for future use once theyhave been defined.andM;</SUMMARY><DESCRIPT>Company:   YSC Tech (products).andO;Product:   dBASE (Data base management system) (computer programs)Query 2.2 (Computer program).andO;Topic:     EvaluationStructured Query LanguageQuery ProcessingSoftware packages.andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Low-cost SQL-based Query Tools Delivers Data in Tables, Graphs, andHistogramsandM;FACT FILEandM;Queery, Version 2.2 YSC Tech, 47 Protea Garden, Willowdale, Ontario, CanadaM2K 2W5; (416) 733-0228.andM;List Price: $88 (U.S.andP;  dollars).andM;Requires: Two floppy disk drives or hard disk; monochrome, Hercules, EGA orVGA monitor (CGA not supported); DOS 3.1 or later or OS/2.1 or later.andP;  DOSversion requires 640K RAM.andP;  OS/2 version uses 640K RAM in protected mode.andM;In Short: A useful, well-priced SQL-based interactive query tool that candeliver results in dBASE tables, forms, reports, graphs, and histograms, andcan store and reuse queries once they've been defined.andP;  Despite poordocumentation, examples and sample queries make it easy to learn and use.andM;Time and time again it has been demonstrated that software doesn't have to beexpensive to offer a lot of functionality.andP;  YSC Tech's Query, Version 2.2,certainly falls into that category.andP;  The $88 program uses a healthy subset ofSQL (with support for SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE, as well as expressionsusing DISTINCT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING) to query dBASEfiles, and delivers the results in tables, reports, graphs, or histograms.andM;Query operates on database and index files generated by dBASE III, III Plus,and IV, including the latter's .MDX multiple index files.andP;  Not only does itlet you store and retrieve queries by name and reuse them through itscustomizable menu system, it also lets you construct queries from pull-downmenus via its interactive interface.andP;  The program even supplies a shell, soyou can issue SQL SELECT commands from the DOS prompt or from inside ofanother program.andM;Query's table queries can join two or three database files at a time, aprocedure that's similar to dBASE-style relations.andP;  You can edit the resultsfrom a movable, sizable window that holds one record per row, and designateread-only and calculated fields, locked columns, and column colors.andP;  You cansort or group the results, and specify your own headings, footers, andtotals.andP;  A pop-up editor is available for editing memo files.andM;While you can insert new, blank records in the database, Query will notupdate any indexes if you change the contents of key fields.andP;  You can savethe query results in a new dBASE file, or generate instant histograms andgraphs with the touch of a function key.andM;Query will also let you retrieve query results in reports and forms that canbe printed, displayed on the screen, or saved to a file.andP;  Forms can displayfields from multiple databases with one record on each screen.andM;Reports, which present a read-only view of the data, must first be designedwith the report editor.andP;  They can include headers, footers, multiple levelsof subtotals, and crosstab summaries.andP;  The report editor offers facilitiesfor omitting blank lines, controlling color, and manipulating laser printerfonts.andP;  Since Query's reports can display a record on several lines, or morethan one record on a line, you can also use them to create mailing labels.andM;Query excels at creating graphs and histograms of query results.andP;  The formerare standard x,y graphs, where the plotted value is a simple field or acomplex expression.andP;  When you generate a graph, Query switches the display tographics mode, which supports nearly every kind of monitor except CGA.andP;  Graphtypes include bar, stacker bar, and pie charts.andP;  You can embed text legendsin them, add titles, select the data point symbol and color, add free-formtext, and rotate the axis of a graph.andP;  While scaling is automatic, a manualoverride ise available.andM;To create histograms, Query takes a range of values from a database columnand breaks them into categories; then its produces a total for each category.andO;Each record can contribute either a value of 1 or a weighted amount to thecategory.andM;While it will always allow you to create queries on the fly, Query's mostpowerful feature is its ability to store and reuse a query once you'vedefined it.andP;  These are stored in a database table, sorted by a name yousupply and a description.andP;  You can select and rerun a stored query at anytime, regardless of the form in which the results are returned.andP;  Query alsocan build a menu from a table of menu headings and subheadings.andP;  You can runQuery from a batch file, program, or the DOS prompt, and have it display acustomized menu where each selection invokes a query or a graph.andP;  Thus, youcan make Query an extension of a custom application, and users need neverknow they are using it.andM;You can purchase versions of Query for either DOS or OS/2, but the OS/2version is the better performer.andP;  This is largely because of the availabilityof OS/2's virtual memory and better system resources.andP;  While this version isfully compatible with the DOS version, its graphs are incompatible with theOS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  So, you'll have to run the OS/2 version in itsown screen group.andP;  And while the program will run on a LAN, its multiusersupport is primitive, and you'll find it undesirable to have someone editinga database where a query is simultaneously being run.andM;As it stands, Query has only one major flaw: documentation that is poorlywritten and devoid of diagrams and screen shots.andP;  This makes the terminologyand concepts more difficult to grasp until you actually exercise that part ofthe program.andP;  Fortunately, the package comes with a number of sample queries.andO;You'll do well to skip the documentation and try these out--they makeeverything clearer.andM;This flaw aside, Query is a fine tool that you'll want to consider if SQL isyour forte.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
