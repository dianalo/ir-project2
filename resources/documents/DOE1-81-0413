Thetrend is to prevent, if possible, the formation of pollutants and toachieve better efficiency. Examples are the fluidized-bed technologyand the combined gas/steam turbine cycle. In nuclear engineering, effortsare concentrating on minimization of residual risks and in the furtheroptimization of an economic efficiency of operation. (orig.)</TEXT></DOC>
