President Suharto approved proposals from a governmentteam on foreign debt to postpone four large projects, as wellas to confirm that three others totaling $1.5 billion can goahead. Jakarta's action deals a blow to state oil companyPertamina, which had been planning a range of expansionprojects.</LP><TEXT>   The three projects authorized to go ahead are thefollowing:   -- An upgrade and expansion of Pertamina's Musi Refineryin South Sumatra for a total of $324 million. Japan Gas Co.signed a construction contract in May.   -- Expansion of Pertamina's liquefied natural gas plant inEast Kalimantan. A $750 million loan has been signed andconstruction begun on the project to expand Indonesia's LNGproduction capacity by 2.25 million metric tons a year.   -- Construction of a $440 million, 420-kilometer pipelineconnecting a gas field north of Bali with Surabaya in EastJava. The pipeline is important to Indonesian efforts toincrease domestic use of its large gas resources, saving oilfor exports.   The four postponed projects are the following:   -- A $1.26 billion aromatics center in Aceh, near thenorthern tip of Sumatra. This project, planned since the late1970s, would use condensate to produce aromatics, which arethen further processed to make fibers, detergents and otherpetrochemical products. Pertamina had awarded theconstruction work to Thyssen AG of Germany and Chiyoda Corp.and Mitsui andamp; Co., both of Japan.   -- A $3.7 billion export-oriented refinery at Dumai inSumatra. The government had been negotiating a constructioncontract with several Japanese companies.   -- Upgrading a refinery at Cilacap in Java. This $2.5billion project called for construction of a residualcatalytic cracking unit. Construction was to be done by ToyoEngineering Corp. of Japan.   -- A $2.4 billion olefins complex in west Java. Thisproject was planned by PT Chandra Asri, a company close toPresident Suharto's family. Last year Chandra Asri awarded aconstruction contract to Toyo Engineering and ABB LummusCrest Inc. of the U.S. and in March held a groundbreakingceremony. But foreign bankers doubted the project couldproceed because it lacked offshore financing.</TEXT></DOC>
