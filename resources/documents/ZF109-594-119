 As of1987-1988, women constituted slightly more than half of the U.S.andP;  populationand 45% of employed workers in the U.S., but they made up only 30% ofemployed computer scientists.andP;  Moreover, they constituted only 10% ofemployed doctoral-level computer scientists.andP;  During the same time period,women made up 20% of physicians and, at the doctoral level, 35% ofpsychologists, 22% of life scientists, and 10% of mathematicians employed inthe U.S.andP;  On the other hand, there are some disciplines in which womenrepresent an even smaller proportion at the doctoral level: in 1987-88, 8% ofphysical scientists, and only 2.5% of engineers were women [21].andP;  [1]  Theunderrepresentation of women in computer science is alarming for at least tworeasons.andP;  First, it raises the disturbing possibility that the field ofcomputer science functions in ways that prevent or hinder women from becomingpart of it.andP;  If this is so, those in the discipline need to evaluate theirpractices to ensure that fair and equal treatment is being provided to allpotential and current computer scientists.andP;  Practices that exclude women arenot only unethical, but they are likely to thwart the discipline's progress,as potential contributors to the field are discouraged from participation.andM;The second reason for concern about the underrepresentation of women incomputer science relates to demographic trends in the U.S., which suggest asignificant decrease in the number of white males entering college during thenext decade.andP;  At the same time, the number of jobs requiring scientific orengineering training will continue to increase.andP;  Because white males havetraditionally constituted the vast majority of trained scientists andengineers in this country, experts have predicted that a critical laborshortage is likely early in the next century [4, 25].andP;  To confront thispossibility, the federal government has begun to expend resources to studythe problem further.andP;  A notable example is the establishment of a NationalTask Force on Women, Minorities, and the Handicapped in Science andTechnology.andP;  Their final report, issued in December of 1989, lists a numberof government and industrial programs aimed at preventing a labor shortage byincreasing the number of women and minorities trained as scientists andengineers [5].andM;In light of these facts, the Committee on the Status of Women in ComputerScience, a subcommittee of the ACM's Committee on Scientific Freedom andHuman Rights, was established with the goal of studying the causes of women'scontinued underrepresentation in the field, and developing proposed solutionsto problems found.andP;  It is the committee's belief that the low number of womenworking as computer scientists is inextricably tied up with the particulardifficulties that women face in becoming computer scientists.andM;Studies show that women in computer science programs in U.S.andP;  universitiesterminate their training earlier than men do.andP;  Between 1983 and 1986 (thelatest year for which we have such figures) the percentage of bachelor'sdegrees in computer science awarded to women was in the range of 36-37%,while the percentage of master's degrees was in the range of 28-30%.andP;  Duringthe same time span, the percentage of doctoral degrees awarded to women hasonly been in the range of 10-12%, and it has remained at that level, with theexception of a slight increase in 1989 [16, 21].andP;  Moreover, the discrepancybetween the numbers of men and women continues to increase when we look atthe people who are training the future computer scientists: women currentlyhold only 6.5% of the faculty positions in the computer science and computerengineering departments in the 158 Ph.D.-granting institutions included inthe 1988-1989 Taulbee Survey (See Communications September 1990).andP;  In fact, athird of these departments have no female faculty members at all [16].andP;  Thispattern of decreasing representation is generally consistent with that ofother scientific and engineering fields [4, 25].andP;  It is often described as&quot;pipeline shrinkage&quot;: as women move along the academic pipeline, theirpercentage continue to shrink.andM;The focus of this report is pipeline shrinkage for women in computer science.andO;We describe the situation forwomen at all stages of training in computerscience, from the precollege level through graduate school.andP;  Because many ofthe problems discussed are related to the lack of role models for women whoare in the process of becoming computer scientists, we also concern ourselveswith the status of women faculty members.andP;  We not only describe the problems,but also make specific recommendations for change and encourage further studyof those problems whose solutions are not yet well understood.andM;Of course, our focus on computer science in the university by no meansexhausts the set of issues that are relevant to an investigation of women incomputer science.andP;  Most notably, we do not directly address issues that areof concern exclusively or primarily to women in industry.andP;  Although some ofthe problems we discuss are common to all women computer scientists, thereare, without doubt, other problems that are unique to one group or the other.andO;Nonetheless, the committee felt that an examination of the process ofbecoming a computer scientist provided a good starting point for a widerinvestigation of women in the field.andP;  Clearly, to increase the number ofwomen in industrial computer science, one must first increase the number ofwomen trained in the discipline.andP;  Thus, we need to consider why women stoptheir training earlier than men: too few women with bachelor's degrees incomputer science translates into too few women in both industry and academia.andO;Moreover, because of the documented positive effects of same-sex role models[12], it is also important to consider why women drop out in higher numbersthan do men even later in their academic training: too few women withdoctorate degrees results in too few women faculty members.andP;  This in turnmeans inadequate numbers of role models for younger women in the process ofbecoming computer scientists.andM;What is Special aboutandM;Computer Science?andM;There are many professions in which women are underrepresented.andP;  Indeed, aswe noted earlier, underrepresentation of women is a fact in most scientificdisciplines, and the pipeline shrinkage pattern seen in computer science iscommon to most sciences.andP;  Thus, one of the first questions we need to ask is:what, if anything, is different about computer science?andP;  Are there anyspecial characteristics of the discipline that lead to unusual problems forwomen?andP;  Studies addressing these questions have been undertaken by bothcomputer scientists and social scientists, and have identified culturalfactors that are significant contributors to women's special experience incomputing.andP;  These factors range from influences present in elementary-schooleducational software through the experiences of computer science graduatestudents.andM;Computers are encountered today by most children in this country more so thanthe artifacts of other science and engineering fields, even if they neverstudy computer science in a formal educational setting.andP;  The earliestcomputer artifacts that children encounter are not gender neutral.andO;Recreational and educational software programs reflect the gender biases andstereotypes of their designers, and studies reveal that educational softwareis generally designed to appeal to boys.andP;  For a host of reasons that arebeyond the scope of this report, girls and boys have been shown to preferdifferent kinds of software programs.andP;  It is thus disturbing that, in anexperimental setting, teachers instructed to design software for studentstended to build programs that have the characteristics that boys prefer, andfew characteristics that girls prefer--even when they are aware of thesedifferences [13].andM;In addition to abstract characteristics of software use, the cultural valuesembedded in educational software and computer games that target adolescentsalmost exclusively reflect what is commonly identified as adolescent maleculture.andP;  The predominant themes of recreational computer games are war,battles, crimes, destruction, and traditionally male-oriented sports andhobbies [14].andP;  Thus, it is not surprising that boys use computers in coursesand summer camps bothearlier and more often than do girls.andM;Experience in computer use, and a resulting comfort with and affinity forcomputing, have a strong effect on the stsudy of computer science in theuniversity.andP;  When college students encounter computer science, they alreadyperceive its strong cultural component.andP;  Those who are knowledgeable aboutcomputers are differentiated by special names (wizards, hackers, wheels), andare expected to have distinguishing characteristics, language, and behaviors.andO;This &quot;hacker elite&quot; system, along with th relatively new academic structureof computer science which may seem chaotic and confusing to students, resultsin many &quot;computing dropouts&quot; who are alienated by the foreign culture [23].andO;Of course, these problems may affect male as well as female students, but thesituation is likely to be more pronounced for females who, because of thedifferences in early experiences with computers, are less likely to be a partof the elite.andM;The cultural factors we have described thus far appear to have an effect evenon women who are making their way successfully through the computer sciencepipeline.andP;  A study of doctoral students in a world-class computer sciencedepartment found that while male and female students exhibited comparableperformance quality in their studies, the women students felt much lesscomfortable, confident, and successful than did the men [3].andM;It is important to acknowledge the significance of cultural influences in theacceptance and success of women in computer science.andP;  The studies we referredto show that there are a number of aspects of the computer science culturethat may act against women.andP;  Unfortunately, there are no easy solutions tothis problem.andP;  There are a few specific and obvious recommendations that canbe made; for instance, more educational software appealing to girls should bedeveloped.andP;  Similarly, educators and educational institutions must make aconcerted effort to ensure equal access to computers for boys and girls.andO;However, more far-reaching solutions are less tangible.andP;  What appears to beneeded is increased sensitivity on the part of male computer scientists totheir female students and colleagues, an increased awareness by women so thatthey will not be easily discouraged, and quite simply, an increased number ofwomen in the field.andM;In addition to the cultural barriers women face, they also encounter issuesof physical safety.andP;  This is because, as is also the case for those in thelaboratory sciences, computer scientists must often be at their workplaceafter dark.andP;  This is particularly true of students who often do not havecomputers or terminals at home.andP;  The inability to use public terminal areasafter hours not only makes it difficult to complete one's assignments, butalso precludes informal interactions with other students, an integral part ofone's education.andP;  For more senior computer scientists after hours access tosophisticated computing systems that cannot be duplicated at home may benecessary.andM;All computer scientists, male and female, require safe access to theworkplace, particularly at night.andP;  Yet, for obvious reasons, such access iseven more essential for women.andP;  Availability of a well-lit, short route tothe office from well-lit, safe parking and a sense of safety in thedepartment at night are crucial.andP;  It is accepted academic and professionalpractice to work at night, and women should be able to do so safely.andP;  Asnoted previously, working at home is not always possible.andP;  If working atnight in the department or on public terminals is not feasible, a woman'sworking hours are restricted to a subset of those available to her malecolleagues.andP;  As one woman professor put it, &quot;in many places it is a realproblem to do work at night for security reasons, but it is a necessity forprofessional reasons&quot; [16, p. 32].andM;One partial solution to this problem is to make campus administrators awareof the issue, so that they will address it when planning new buildings andparking areas.andP;  Also useful are services that provide escorts for thosewalking around campus after dark.andP;  In addition, because the issue of safetyinside the office at night is equally important, it is crucial that safetyprocedures such as keeping the building locked at night always be followed.andO;Consciousness-raising within computer science departments may help guaranteethat safety procedures are developed and consistently followed.andP;  Finally, weshould find ways to take advantage of the fact that much computer scienceresearch can be done remotely.andP;  One recommendation is that funding agencies,such as the National Science Foundation (NSF), provide small grants to femaleprofessors to purchase terminals or workstations, printers, and modems forhome use, to redress partially the problem of unequal access to resources[16, p. 32].andP;  Male and female faculty advising female graduate students mightalso find ways to loan such equipment to them.andP;  Access to computing equipmentat home can also help women who are attempting to balance their careers withfamily responsibilities that require them to be home in the evenings.andP;  As wewill describe, the conflict between these two sets of responsibilities isanother source of difficulty for many women.andM;Other Obstracies forandM;WomenandM;Previously we described special characteristics of our discipline thatpresent challenges to women who are attempting to become computer scientistsor whose are training future computer scientists.andP;  The majority of obstaclesfor women in the discipline are also shared by other women scientists andengineers, and to a lesser degree, by all other women employed outside thehome.andP;  In our view, there are four primary and interrelated challenges facingwomen:andM;* Difficulties with self-esteem,andM;* Lack of mentoring and role models,andM;* Gender discrimination, andandM;* Difficulties balancing career and family responsibilities.andM;We discuss each of these problems in turn, attempting again to suggest waysto combat them.andP;  If course, since these problems are not unique to womenbecoming computer scientists, the soltions we propse may also hve widerapplicability.andM;Diminished Self-EsteemandM;Several studies of college students have shown that women experience a muchgreater lack of self-esteem during their college years than do men.andP;  In the1988 American Association for the Advancement of Science Presidential Lecture[25], Sheila Widnall noted that a recent survey of graduate students inmedicine, science, and engineering at Stanford University [26] found that&quot;that women were indistinguishable from the men in objective measures ofpreparation, career aspirations, and performance in graduate school.andP;  Theydiffered significantly in their perceptions of their preparation for graduatestudy, in the pressures and roadblocks that they experienced, and in thestrategies that they developed for coping with these pressures.andP;  .  .  .  30%of the women versus 15% of the men questioned their ability to handle thework; 27% versus 12% found criticism difficult to accept; only 30% of thewomen versus 57% of the men felt confident speaking up in class; and 33versus 9% feared that speaking up would reveal their inadequacies [25, pp.andO;1741, 1744].&quot;andM;Widnall also reports on the Illinois Valedicatorian Project, which followed80 high school valedictorians (46 women, 34 men) through their college years[1].andP;  At the end of their college careers, the women had a slightly higherfinal grade point average than the men (3.6 vs.andP;  3.5).andP;  But the women hadexperienced a significantly higher loss of self-esteem.andP;  As high schoolseniors, about 20% of both men and women ranked themselves as &quot;far aboveaverage,&quot; and about 45% as &quot;above average.&quot;andP;  As college sophomores, about 20%of the men thought they were &quot;far above average,&quot; as opposed to about 3% ofthe women; about 50% of the men and a little more than 40% of the womenranked themselves &quot;above average.&quot;andP;  By their senior year, 25% of the men andnone of the women thought they were &quot;far above average,&quot; with about 55% ofthe men and 70% of the women considering themselves &quot;above average.&quot;andO;Overall, the self-confidence of the men increased slightly during college,while that of the women decreased significantly.andM;It seems clear that the diminished self-esteem of female college studentscontributes to the pipeline shrinkage problem.andP;  Indeed, while the studiesthat Widnall reports on refer to self-esteem problems of undergraduates,similar problems may be even more significant at the graduate level, wherestudents receive primarily subjective feedback from their advisors and peers,as opposed to the more objective feedback of test scores and course gradesavailable to undergraduates.andP;  An additional complicating factor is thediffering communication styles of men and women.andP;  Studies have shown that ingroup settings, women are interrupted more frequently than men, and theircontributions are often either attributed to men or ignored altogether [10,11, 25].andP;  Such experiences are likely to exacerbate an existing lack ofself-confidence.andM;Diminished self-esteem may well cause a woman to not consider valid careeroptions, because she believes that she is not sufficiently well qualified.andO;Even women who consider themselves to be as well qualified as most of theirmale peers may lower their career goals when they recognize the additionalproblems that women may face.andP;  As widnall points out:andM;&quot;A second trend noted in [the Illinois valedicatorian Project] was thelowering of career ambitions by the women students.andP;  The researchers linkedlowered career ambitions in part to the unresolved dual-career problem.andP;  .  .andO;.  One of the most effective antidotes for these uncertainties about careergoals was the opportunity for successful professional experiences:independent research, professional employment, opportunity for interactionwith graduate students, and the support and encouragement of a faculty mentor[25, p. 1743].&quot;andM;Those who train women to become computer scientists need to become aware ofthe problem of diminished self-esteem, and work to combat it.andP;  Toward thisend, it is important to give students unambiguous feedback concerning thequality of their work, to provide equal attention to and have equalexpectations of female and male students, and to increase awareness ofdifferent, especially less aggressive, communication styles.andP;  In addition, itis essential to provide women with the opportunity for successfulprofessional experiences.andP;  computer science faculty need to make an effort todraw women into their research projects.andP;  Whle this is of course true offaculty members training graduate students, efforts to include females inresearch projects should ideally begin at the undergraduate level.andP;  Supportmust therefore be given to funding that will facilitate this, both at thenational and institutional levels.andP;  An example of a model program is theNational Science Foundation's Research in Undergraduate Institutions (RUI)program [19], the goal of which is to provide research opportunities forundergraduates in the sciences.andP;  RUI awards are limited to projects thatinclude significant undergraduate participation.andP;  By using programs such asthe RUI to bring women to research early in their careers, faculty membersmay help combat diminished self-esteem in women and its impact on attrition.andM;Mentoring and role ModelsandM;Another major problem facing women in the process of becoming computerscientists is a shortage of mentors.andP;  Mentors play a crucial, though usuallyinformal, role in the training of young computer scientists.andP;  In general, amentor shares with a less experienced colleague information about how to getresearch funding, avenues for publication, the informal power structurewithin a department and within the discipline as a whole, and so on.andP;  Mentorsmay invest a good deal of time in their junior colleagues and may offer themimportant opportunities for research collaboration.andM;Currently, women are much more likely than men to be mentored by femalefaculty members [1, 19].andP;  However, there is no reason that men cannot serveas mentors for women, given an appropriate sensitivity to the problems thatwomen in computer science may face.andP;  Indeed, because the number of womencomputer scientists shrinks as one progresses through the pipeline, it isunreasonable to expect senior women to mentor all of the junior women.andP;  Menin computer science must also support younger women.andM;Related to mentoring is the issue of role models.andP;  While young computerscientists can benefit from mentors of either gender, it is desirable forwomen to be exposed to female role models.andP;  A role model can serve asevidence that a successful career in computer science is not only apossibility, but a normal and unremarkable option for women.andP;  The existenceof role models does matter, and it matters to women at all stages of theircareers.andP;  For students, female faculty members prove, by their veryexistence, that Ph.D.andP;  degrees and faculty slots can be attained by women[11, 12].andP;  A similar phenomenon is true of female faculty members who serveas role models for their more junior colleagues.andP;  Junior women who haveaccess to senior female faculty members adjust to their positions andestablish research programs more quickly than those who do not [7].andM;Of course, the only real solution to the lack of role models is to increasethe number of women in computer science: recall that only 6.5% of computerscience and computer engineering faculty at the Taulbee institutions arefemale.andP;  However, until this situation improves, programs that makesuccessful women more visible can help.andP;  Examples are programs that bringwomen scientists to campuses for a short period of time to give a talk, orfor a longer period of time in a visiting faculty position.andP;  Activities ofthe former sort can be encouraged by anyone who is involved in a departmentalcolloquium or seminar series.andP;  Invitation for a longer period requiresadditional funding; one source of support is the NSF's VisitingProfessorships for Woman program [22].andM;At the undergraduate level, it is useful to design programs in whichundergraduates are paired with female graduate students and/or faculty.andO;Examples of successful programs of this kind include one run by the Women'sScience and Engineering Network at Stanford University [24] and the Women inScience Program at the University of Michigan [25].andP;  Such programs can havethe additional benefit of providing graduate women with the experience ofbeing viewed as capable and successful scientists.andM;Finally, we should point out that role models are important even toprecollege women.andP;  Without sufficient role models, high school girls may endtheir mathematics and science training prematurely, thus precluding a majorin science or engineering before they even begin college.andP;  High schoolguidance counselors and math and science teachers can play a role here byencouraging capable young women to consider science and engineering as validcareer options.andP;  Several programs have been developed to encourage highschool girls to acquire sufficient training to keep their options open.andO;Perhaps the most extensive program of this kind is administered by theMath/Science Network, a non-profit organization that organizes conferencesunder the title of &quot;Expanding Your Horizons in Science and Mathematics&quot; [7].andO;These conferences bring high school girls together with local femalescientists.andP;  Other more local programs include science fairs, sponsored byschools, scouting troops, or similar organizations, in which women areincluded among the judges.andP;  To increase the influence of science fairs, theymay be augmented with career awareness workshops in which participatingstudents can meet with local scientists and engineers to learn about careerpaths and the educational prerequisites for technical careers.andM;DiscriminationandM;The issue of gender discrimination is of course a large one, which cannot bediscussed in great depth here.andP;  By gender discrimination, we mean patronizingbehavior and assumptions that women are less qualified and/or committed thanmen, regardless of whether the assumptions are conscious or unconscious.andP;  Adetailed discussion of the problem of gender discrimination as it relates towomen in computer science departments can be found in the 1983 report&quot;Barriers to Equality in Academia,&quot; which was written by a group of femalegraduate students and research staff in the computer science department atMIT [2].andP;  This influential report notes that the cumulative effects of subtlediscrimination may be even more harmful than relatively infrequent incidentsof overt discrimination:andM;&quot;Often, subtle behavior is not recognized as discriminatory, for two reasons.andO;First, the actions often are not intended to be discriminatory; the peoplewho convey biased attitudes toward women may be well-intentioned.andO;Nevertheless, the effect of their behavior is to undermine the professionalimage of women held by their colleagues and the women themselves.andP;  Second,any particular incident might appear trivial when viewed by itself.andP;  However,when women experience such incidents daily, the overall effect of theenvironment is much greater than the sum of the individual incidents.andO;Because subtle discrimination is harder to recognize than overtdiscrimination, it sometimes does more damage.andP;  Constant exposure to negativecomments diminishes a woman's self-esteem and may lead her to believe thatshe cannot succeed [2, p. 3].&quot;andM;Several reports issued by the Project on the Status and Education of Women(PSEW) of the Association of American Colleges address the subject of genderdiscrimination as it relates to women undergraduates, graduate students, andfaculty [10, 11].andP;  These reports concur with the MIT report's observations onthe chilling effect of cumulative incidents of discrimination:andM;&quot;Overtly disparaging remarks about women, as well as more subtle differentialbehaviors, can have a critical and lasting effect.andP;  When they occurfrequently--especially when they involve &quot;gatekeepers&quot; who teach requiredcourses, act as advisors, or serve as chairs of departments--such behaviorscan have a profound negative impact on women's academic and careerdevelopment by: ...andP;  causing students to switch majors or subspecialtieswithin majors.andP;  .  .  ; minimizing the development of the individualcollegial relationships with faculty which are crucial for futureprofessional development; dampening career aspirations; and underminingconfidence [10, p. 3].&quot;andM;The PSEW reports, by documenting manifestations of both overt and subtlegender discrimination throughout academia, provide evidence that the problemsdescribed in the MIT report are not unique to computer science.andM;A recent study of several science and engineering departments also draws theconnection between gender discrimination and the effective exclusion of womenfrom first-class citizenship in their departments.andP;  The study states that&quot;differential attention to women students was felt to promote performancestress while exclusion from informal relations was a career handicap&quot; [6].andM;A particular manifestation of the differential attention paid to females inthe field is what has been called the &quot;invisibility syndrome.&quot;andP;  Not only isthe percentage of women in computer science smaller than the percentage ofwomen in the general population, but also, even within the field, women areunderrepresented in many important professional activities.andP;  Ideally, therepresentation of women in the perceived power structure of a communityshould reflect their numbers in that community.andP;  One would expect reasonable,non-token representation of women on the editorial boards of technicaljournals; as guest editors of special issues of journals; on programcommittees of technical conferences; as invited speakers both at conferencesand at departmental colloquia; on executive boards of professionalorganizations such as ACM and IEEE; and on policy boards such as theComputing Research Association (Formerly the Computer Research Board) and theComputer Science and Technology Board.andM;Unfortunately, even those women who have been successful often appear to beinvisible, and are not invited to participate in activities of this type tothe same degree as their male counterparts.andP;  One way to address this problemis to make people aware of it, so that those whose job it is to nominate orappoint people to boards, program committees, etc., can make a consciouseffort to include qualified women.andP;  Another solution, towards which somewomen in the field have begun to work, is to compile lists of qualified womenin various areas of computer science who can be suggested to those who areresponsible for issuing invitations and nominations.andM;Not only do women often find themselves subject to the type of unintentionaldiscrimination described so far, but they may also be confronted withinstances of more overt discrimination or even sexual harassment.andP;  It istherefore necessary that departments and universities develop and institutegrievance procedures that guarantee confidentiality and freedom fromretaliation.andP;  We recommend further study of already implemented grievanceprocedures to determine policies necessary to ensure their effectiveness.andM;The author of the MIT study, like those of the PSEW reports, state that&quot;responsibility for change rests with the entire community, not just with thewomen,&quot; and that &quot;many problems would be alleviated by increasing the numberof women&quot; [2, p. 1].andP;  We agree completely, and recommend that the kinds ofactions we have proposed elsewhere in the report be adopted to help increasewomen's representation in the field.andM;Balancing ResponsibilitiesandM;A final issue that is of central concern involves the difficulties inbalancing the responsibilities of a career in computer science with theresponsibilities of raising a family.andP;  Concern with this problem may leadyoung women to abandon the possibility of a career in computer science (orany other science) at a very early stage in their training, as indicated inthe quotation from the Widnall report noted earlier (&quot;researchers linkedlowered career ambitions in part to the unresolved dual-career problem&quot;).andO;Actual difficulties encountered in achieving this balance may result in womenleaving computer science later in their careers.andP;  Of course, in their concernwith this problem, women considering or pursuing careers in computer scienceare not very different from women in a wide range of other careers--or, forthat matter from many men in those careers.andP;  Last April, a New York Timesarticle noted, &quot;Fathers, too, are seeking a balance between their familiesand careers.&quot;andP;  However, while achieving such a balance may be difficult forpeople pursuing many different careers, there are certain aspects of atenure-track position in a scientific field that render the balancing actparticularly difficult [18].andM;The typical &quot;tenure-track&quot; career path appears to be generally incompatiblewith outside interests and responsibilities including, but not limited to,childbearing and rearing.andP;  Junior faculty in tenure-track positions (likejunior lawyers working towards partnerships, junior investment bankers tryingto become vice presidents, etc.) are expected to devote enormous amounts oftime and energy to their careers: so much time and energy that seriousoutside interests are precluded or at least greatly constrained.andP;  The modelfor an academic career was developed during a time in which faculty positionswere primarily occupied by men who had wives to tend to their homeresponsibilities.andP;  We call this the helpmate-in-the-background model.andP;  It isone that is still present today: an illustration can be found in theacknowledgments statement of many academic books.andP;  An example, from a recentbook authored by a male computer scientist, includes a statement of gratitudeto his wife &quot;for sheltering [him] from the travails of the real world.&quot;andM;The problem is that the helpmate-in-the-background model is inappropriate fortoday's society, in which both men and women should have the right, and oftenhave the obligation, to have careers.andP;  The model is most obviouslyinappropriate for women.andP;  Women were the helpmates-in-the-background: they donot typically have helpmates of their own.andM;Further complicating the situation is the fact of women's &quot;biologicalclocks.&quot;andP;  Most students do not complete the Ph.D.andP;  until the middle or late20s and tenure is typically not granted until the middle 30s.andP;  Hence, thechildbearing years directly coincide with the period of time during which awoman is completing her Ph.D.andP;  and working towards tenure.andP;  Both rearingsmall children and achieving tenure are tremendously time-consuming efforts;doing both at the same time seems to many women to be exceptionallydifficult, if not impossible [6].andM;There are a number of things that can be done to help women achieve a balancebetween family responsibilities and career demands.andP;  For example,universities can and should provide affordable, quality childcare.andO;Sufficient maternity leave policies are also necessary.andP;  Many universitieshave no formal leave policy at all, while others grant only minimal leaves(e.g., one month or less).andP;  A few will allow women a semester off fromteaching responsibilities, at reduced pay.andP;  At those universities that do notoffer this option, female faculty are often put in the position of having totry to &quot;time&quot; their babies for semesters that they had planned to take offanyway, such as summer semesters, sabbatical periods, or semesters duringwhich they used grant money to &quot;buy out&quot; of teaching.andP;  However, the first ofthese options is often not viable, since most computer science faculty do nothave the summer off; instead, they use this period to work on researchgrants, generally a requirement for tenure.andP;  The latter two options generallyrequire that the woman already have tenure or at least be fairly close to it.andO;Moreover, attempts to schedule a baby's arrival are far from reliable, andoften fail.andP;  Thus, better maternity leave policies are obviously needed.andM;But solutions like these do not go far enough.andP;  Fundamental changes in thepatterns of academic careers are required.andP;  These changes must rest on arealization that it is the responsibilities of parenting a small child, andnot the responsibilities of mothering a small child, that are incompatiblewith current work requirements.andP;  The model of a helpmate-in-the-backgroundshould be as untenable for men in today's society as it is for women.andM;It is true that there are issues that will always be specific towomen--pregnancy, childbirth, and lactation--and career paths must bedesigned with these in mind.andP;  But there are other realities of women's livesthat should be seen merely as traditionally women's.andP;  Many of these can andshould be shared by men.andP;  For example, universities must develop not justmaternal policies, but parental policies that will allow male as well asfemale faculty members to be involved in the rearing of small children.andP;  Manyuniversities today provide no parental leave at all.andP;  Yet, fathers not onlyneed time off immediately after the birth of a child, but also, like mothers,need reduced workloads for an extended period of time, to enable them toparticipate in the rearing of their small children.andP;  Thus, another importantpolicy that must be developed, for both men and women, involves changing theway in which the tenure clock operates.andM;As with maternity leaves, different universities have different policiesregarding slowing the tenure clock to allow a faculty member to care for asmall child.andP;  Differences involve: (1) whether any slowing of the tenureclock is allowed at all; (2) whether it is permitted only for the &quot;primarycaretaker&quot; or whether it is permitted for both parents; (3) whether it ispermitted for adoptions; (4) the period of time for which the clock isstopped (typically, one semester); (5) the number of children for which thisis allowed (typically one, sometimes two).andP;  In our view, some kind of reducedwork load is essential to permit faculty members who wish to do so to betterbalance their family responsibilities with their careers.andP;  Moreover, thisoption should be available to fathers as well as mothers.andP;  There have beensome doubts expressed about this solution: the claim is that fathers will&quot;take advantage&quot; of the situation by stopping the tenure clock even thoughthey are not participating heavily in the rearing of their child.andP;  The worryis that if this happens, the default tenure period will simply become sevenyears instead of six, and women who do take primary responsibility for therearing of their children will once again be at a disadvantage.andM;In our view, this possibility must be faced, but it appears that one solutionis to make a strong effort not to change the standards for tenure.andP;  That is,departments must continue to impose the same tenure requirements as they donow, but must assume that some faculty members will take seven or eight yearsto meet those requirements rather than six.andP;  We need to expect that, at leastin the beginning, some faculty members may take the extra year or two even ifthey do not have additional child-rearing demands.andP;  As long as the standardsare not raised, which would penalize those with additional responsibilities,this is not a dire consequence.andM;Because the issues surrounding leave policies, deferred tenure, and relatedissues are so complex, we recommend a systematic study of policies inacademic departments, to better evaluate the options.andP;  It is even possiblethat the conclusion of such a study will be that the entire tenure process isincompatible with the demands of a dual-career society.andP;  After all, thedemands of rearing a small child do not stop after six weeks or one semesteror even one year of a leave.andP;  When the helpmate-in-the-background model isthrown out, it needs to be replaced with a much more flexible one in whichpeople are free to move on and off of a &quot;fast track&quot; at different stages intheir career, without those moves permanently jeopardizing that career.andP;  Thisis exactly what tenure precludes: if a faculty member is not fully committedto his or her academic career during the very same period of time in which heor she is most likely to face the demands of raising small children, tenureis unlikely to be granted and the academic career will be permanentlystalled.andM;Although we have emphasized that the traditional helpmate-in-the-backgroundmodel works against women with children, we believe it also works againstwomen without children and men with employed wives.andP;  Few of these people havesuch helpmates.andM;In our view, it is important to work to change the helpmate-in-the-backgroundmode.andP;  It must be possible for both women and men to work hard and well at acareer, without neglecting their personal lives.andP;  We believe this willeventually be advatageous for both men and women.andP;  There is greatsatisfaction to be found in one's work, but there is also great satisfactionto be found in one's personal life.andP;  No one should have to choose one at theexpense of the other.andM;Reopening the PipelineandM;As a result of the kinds of problems we have discussed, many women havedropped out of the computer science pipeline prematurely.andP;  Although we havebeen focusing on ways to reverse this trend, an additional approach tocorrecting the problem of underrepresentation is to help women reenter thepipeline after dropping out of it early.andP;  One example of a particularlysuccessful reentry program is the University of California at Berkeleyprogram, which has been in existence since 1983.andP;  It is aimed at makinggraduate study in computer science possible for women and minority studentswho have received a bachelor's degree in another field.andP;  Students in theBerkeley reentry program take regular computer science courses along withundergraduates, and in addition receive a host of support services.andP;  Theprogram has been producing graduates for seven years now, and students whohave completed the program have been quite successful in gaining admission tocompetitive graduate programs in computer science [9].andM;A second set of women for whom reopening the pipeline may be useful are thosewith science degrees who are not employed in science.andP;  A 1976 NSF program,called the Science Career facilitation (SCF) Projects, was aimed at suchwomen.andP;  This extensive program, which was later discontinued, funded 21projects in fields where women were poorly represented even though jobs werereadily available.andP;  Three of these 21 projects dealt with women reenteringcomputer science.andM;An evaluation of the SCF projects led to several important findings.andP;  Theprimary reasons most women cited for having dropped out of science involvedfamily responsibilities.andP;  Research supported by the SCF projects surveyedmore than 2000 organizations providing potential employment to scientists,and revealed that none of them attended to the needs of reentering women.andO;Yet programs that do address this would appear to be very useful: after all,more than 585,000 women scientists expressed an interest in retraining andreentry.andP;  Finally, the SCF projects that provided this retraining were quitesuccessful: in total, 65% of the participants were reemployed in sciencewhile another 10% became full-time graduate students [15].andM;ConclusionsandM;We have presented some of the problems facing women who are in the process ofbecoming computer scientists, as well as the women who are training them, andwe have made recommendations for change (see sidebar).andP;  There appear to beclear and relatively easily implemented solutions for some problems, whilefor others, such as the apparent conflict between child-rearing and gainingtenure, the issues are more complex and further study is required to developeffective solutions.andP;  Indeed, complete resolution of some of these problemswill depend upon significant societal changes.andP;  Ultimately, everything hingeson increasing the number of women in the field.andP;  We must make sure thatincreased representation of women is not stalled because of policies orpractices of computer science educators or employers.andM;Obviously, this article is not comprehensive.andP;  We have not, for example,addressed problems unique to women in industrial computer science, nor havewe considered how the problems we have described are exacerbated for women ofcolor or disabled women.andP;  We believe it is important that these issues beexamined, but we leave them for other articles.andM;(1) Statistics were also acquired from the U.S.andP;  Bureau of Labor Statisticsin a telephone conversation.andM;ReferencesandM;[1] Arnold K.andP;
