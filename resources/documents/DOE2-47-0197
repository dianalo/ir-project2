The temperature-dependent function of the corrosionin azeotropic nitric acid conforms to Arrhenius relations. The concentration-dependentfunction of the corrosion in 20 to 75 (80%) nitric acid can be describedby a hyperbolic equation. An exception is formed by X 1 CrNiSi 18 15.(orig./MM) With 77 figs., 7 tabs., 17 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
