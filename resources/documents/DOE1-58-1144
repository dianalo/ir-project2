A single-electron-captureprobability P/sub SC/({theta}) is determined, which, with applicationof binomial statistics, provides a good description of measured charge-statedistributions for {theta}andless;10 mrad. For scattering angles {theta}andgt;10 mrad,projectile and recoil-ion charge-state distributions are nearly identical,indicating full participation of all L-shell electrons in quasimolecularstates. Nearly all electron-capture processes are followed by autoionization,indicating the importance of capture into multiply excited states. Weobserved a strong angular dependence of the autoionization probabilities.</TEXT></DOC>
