Now, shesays, agents answer her calls.   London has always loved American dramatists, not just greatssuch as Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill but the up-and-comingtoo, as Nemeth has discovered.   John Logan is virtually unheard of in the United States, exceptin his home city, Chicago. But his 1983 play, ``Never the Sinner,''is running on London's West End with an impressive cast headed byJoss Ackland and Julian Glover.   Richard Nelson's off-Broadway play, ``Some Americans Abroad,''was first produced by the Royal Shakespeare Company last summer.The American dramatist's second commission for the British companyopens in Stratford-upon-Avon in the autumn.   One reason American playwrights can make it in Britain is thatproduction costs are much lower here than in New York. Another isthat critical pressures are less acute. London fields an array ofequally influential reviewers. It isn't just a one-critic town suchas New York, where a nod from Frank Rich of The New York Times canmake or break a production.   Some dramatists feel their work strikes more sympathetic chordsabroad.   ``It's hard to go out on a stylistic limb in the States,although I think that is changing,'' said Nemeth, 30, whose ratherparched, opaque writing style is at odds with much American drama.Her new play, ``Mill Fire,'' about an explosion at an Alabama steelmill, opened to mixed reviews March 16 at west London's RiversideStudios.   ``I think my plays are somewhat hard to read in that they'revery spare. It takes someone who can really read that kind of workto respond to it,'' she said.   Nemeth has found that someone in director Brian Stirner, theBriton who staged her two London plays.   Richard Nelson's oblique, ironic tone seems more attuned tocontemporary British writers than to his American peers.   ``The reaction here has been much more generous, much moreunderstanding,'' said Nelson, 39, who has had two plays performedby the RSC: ``Some Americans Abroad'' and ``Principia Scriptoriae.''   Both got better reviews in London than in New York. ``SomeAmericans Abroad'' received an Olivier Award nomination as theyear's best comedy. In London, says Nelson, his plays ``have beencritically perceived and understood and argued about.''   Only recently has he hit problems. In mid-March he quit as bookwriter of ``King,'' the troubled London musical about the Rev.Martin Luther King Jr.   John Logan says his ``Never the Sinner'' shows an interest inhistory less evident in American playwriting. In the Americantheater, he charges, ``We have forgotten our history; we'vebetrayed it.''   He said he did not want to write the kind of personal play thatproliferates in the United States.   ``I have very little regard for anemic TV theater _ fornaturalistic, self-indulgent, sometimes autobiographical drama,''he said. Four of Logan's five favorite dramatists are British:Steven Berkoff, Howard Brenton, Caryl Churchill and Harold Pinter.   Another Chicago writer, Aaron Iverson, wrote a play in 1982 onlyto find it being premiered, professionally, in London last month.   ``I'd had readings of the play done (in Chicago) but no oneexpressed a whole lot of interest,'' said Iverson, 32.   Instead, his ``Side Pockets'' ended its month-long debut March 3at the Theater Royal, Stratford East. Iverson has been commissionedto write a second play for the theater.   He said the playhouse, in a blue-collar, ethnically mixed area,reached a public more difficult to attract in the United States.There, he said, ``the audience I want only watches TV and movies.''   Iverson, who earns his living as a lawyer, says: ``I kind offeel like working-class or poor people aren't really addressedmuch.''   Nemeth has had many offers from American agents in the wake ofLondon productions of her two plays, but producers so far haven'tbeen forthcoming. Logan continues to work regularly in Chicago,where he currently has a commission from the Goodman Theater, buthe has yet to have a major staging of any of his plays in New York.   While none of the writers sees Broadway as a goal, few are readyto renounce the United States altogether and move to London asplaywright Martin Sherman (``When She Danced,'' ``Bent'') did overa decade ago.   Said Nelson: ``I love my country. I'm American; I love living inAmerica.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PM Wed April 11</NOTE></DOC>
