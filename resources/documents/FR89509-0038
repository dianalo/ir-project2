As discussedlater in this preamble, the Coast Guard considered input from many sourcesto develop proposed regulations which would best address both the safetyand operational needs of OSVs. The Coast Guard seeks input on all aspectsof the proposed regulations from vessel owners, operators, architects,and builders, and from material vendors, insurers, surveyors, and otherpersons involved with OSVs. Comments concerning the proposed regulations,including additional costs they may impose upon OSVs are requested. Persons submitting comments should include their names and addresses, identifythis notice as CGD 82-004/CGD 86-074 and the specific section or paragraphof the proposal to which each comment applies, and give reasons for eachcomment. The regulations may be changed in light of comments received. All commentsreceived before the expiration of the comment period will be consideredbefore final action is taken on this proposal. No public hearing is planned,but one may be held if a written request for a hearing is received andit is determined that the opportunity to make oral presentations will aidthe rulemaking process. This notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) contains a complete set of regulationsthat would be applied to new OSVs, including liftboats, in lieu of otherexisting regulations. The regulations, as drafted, contain numerous changesand relaxations to standards presently applied to existing OSVs. ExistingOSVs would have the option of meeting the requirements of this NPRM inits entirety, or continuing compliance with, and certification under, existingregulations and policy determinations that apply to existing OSVs.<ITAG tagnum="84">Prior ANPRMS </ITAG>Two advance notices of proposed rulemaking (ANPRMs) have been publishedin this rulemaking. In 1983, an ANPRM was published to provide an earlyopportunity for public comment on a preliminary draft of a comprehensiveset of inspection and certification requirements to be applied to new OSVs.This draft was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of February 14, 1983 (48 FR 6636). Twenty-fourcomments were received on various technical aspects of the proposal andmany of their recommendations have been incorporated into this NPRM. In 1987, a second ANPRM was published asking for specific information toassist in developing specialized regulations for self-elevating OSVs (liftboats).This ANPRM was published in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>of April 16, 1987 (52 FR 12439). Fourteen commentswere received and a discussion of their recommendations and concerns isprovided later in this preamble. <ITAG tagnum="84">Drafting Information </ITAG>The principal persons involved in drafting this proposal are LCDR MichaelM. Rosecrans, Project Manager, Office of Merchant Marine Safety, Securityand Environmental Protection and William R. Register, Project Counsel,Office of the Chief Counsel. <ITAG tagnum="84">RIN Number </ITAG>A regulatory information number (RIN) is assigned to each regulatory actionlisted in the Unified Agenda of Federal Regulations. The Regulatory InformationService Center publishes the Unified Agenda in April and October of eachyear. The RIN number contained in the heading of this document can be usedto cross reference this action with the Unified Agenda. <ITAG tagnum="84">Discussion of the Proposed Regulations </ITAG>This NPRM contains proposed regulations for new offshore supply vessels(OSVs). The regulations would apply to conventionally designed OSVs aswell as to self-elevating OSVs. Most of these vessels conduct operationsin the Gulf of Mexico, although some also operate worldwide. Conventional OSVs have traditionally provided a wide range of supply andsupport services to offshore oil and mineral extractive industries. Self-elevatingOSVs, which are commonly known as liftboats, are more specialized in theiroperations. These vessels have built-in jacking systems which allow themto be ``jacked up'' above the ocean's surface to become, in effect, stationaryplatforms for a temporary period. Once ``jacked up,'' these vessels performspecific support functions, such as maintenance and construction, on behalfof adjacent offshore structures.<ITAG tagnum="81">a. Conventional OSVs </ITAG>Conventional OSVs are predominantly motor propelled, of less than 500 grosstons, and engaged in short voyages. Prior to October 6, 1980, these vesselswere_(a) Inspected by the Coast Guard as cargo and miscellaneous vessels under46 CFR Subchapter I, if over 15 gross tons and carrying freight for hire;(b) Inspected by the Coast Guard as small passenger vessels under 46 CFRSubchapter T, if less than 100 gross tons and carrying more than six passengersfor hire; or (c) Not inspected by the Coast Guard under a ``bareboat charter'' arrangement.The Subchapter I vessels were known as supply boats. Typically, these vesselswere of steel construction, carried large amounts of deck cargo, and carriedup to 16 persons in addition to the crew on domestic voyages as permittedby 46 U.S.C. 3304 (formerly 46 U.S.C. 882). The Subchapter T vessels wereknown as crew boats. Typically, these vessels were of aluminum or steelconstruction, relatively swift, carried limited, but significant, amountsof deck cargo, and carried a large number of passengers. Pub. L. 96-378, which was enacted on October 6, 1980, made significantchanges to the way in which conventional OSVs were to be inspected by theCoast Guard. (In 1983, the provisions of Pub. L. 96-378 were consolidated,without substantive change and recodified in Title 46, Subtitle II. Itsprovisions are now contained principally in 46 U.S.C. 2101(19), 2101(21)(C),3301(3), 3302(g), 3306, 3307, 3501, and 8301). Among the changes mandatedby Pub. L. 96-378 were the following: (1) A controversial feature of the offshore support industry for many yearshad been its use of contractual arrangements involving bareboat charterscoupled with operating agreements in order to operate without a Coast GuardCertificate of Inspection. Public Law 96-378 eliminated this controversyby requiring all OSVs to be inspected. (2) Pub. L. 96-378 defined an OSV as being any vessel that regularly carriesgoods, supplies, or equipment in support of exploration, exploitation,or production of offshore mineral or energy resources, is propelled bymachinery other than steam (<T3>i.e., </T3>is a motor vessel), is not a small passenger vessel regulatedunder 46 CFR Subchapter T, and is between 15 and 500 gross tons. (Thisdefinition has been retained in 46 U.S.C. 2101(19)). (3) Pub. L. 96-378 categorized conventional OSVs as follows: (i) Pre-1979 OSVs, <T3>i.e., </T3>those that were operating in support of the offshore industryon or before January 1, 1979, or that were contracted for on or beforethat date and entered into service before October 6, 1980. (ii) All other OSVs. Since 1980, 355 conventional OSVs have been certificated under SubchapterI or T. (4) Each conventional OSV, other than a pre-1979 OSV, is currently subjectto inspection as follows: (i) A vessel of above fifteen and less than one hundred gross tons is subjectto Coast Guard inspection under Subchapter T. (ii) A vessel of one hundred gross tons and less than five hundred grosstons is subject to Coast Guard inspection under Subchapter I. (5) Each pre-1979 OSV continues to be subject to inspection under SubchapterI or Subchapter T as applicable. On October 20, 1980, the Coast Guard publishedrules (45 FR 69242) requiring that pre-1979 OSVs be registered with anOfficer in Charge, Marine Inspection on or before January 6, 1981, andthat they be certificated not later than two years from the date of registration.These vessels are not subject to existing regulations relating to majorstructural changes or major equipment replacements unless compliance isnecessary to remove an especially hazardous condition. The legislativehistory of Pub. L. 96-378 states, in part, that OSVs should ``conform asclosely as possible to inspection standards applied to new vessels.'' However,it was recognized that it would not be practical to require major structuralor equipment changes on OSVs that were previously uninspected. Therefore,pre-1979 OSVs are not subject to rules, regulations, or standards thatrequire major structural or equipment changes unless the Coast Guard determinesthat those changes are necessary to remove an unreasonable risk to thevessel or the crew. <ITAG tagnum="81">b. Liftboats </ITAG>The Coast Guard is also proposing additional regulations that would applyspecifically to new self-elevating OSVs (liftboats). The high rate of casualtiesexperienced by these vessels requires that specific regulations be developedthat address their design, stability, construction, and operating procedures.The Coast Guard anticipates that promulgation and enforcement of the regulationsproposed in this NPRM would significantly improve the safety record ofliftboats. In April 1987, the Coast Guard published an ANPRM regarding establishmentof inspection and certification criteria for liftboats. (This ANPRM isreferenced above under ``Prior ANPRMs''). As stated in the 1987 ANPRM,the need for regulations was based on the high incidence of casualtiesinvolving liftboats, and upon specific safety recommendations made by theNational Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) in its review of liftboat casualties.A Coast Guard review of the available casualty history from 1980 to 1987was conducted in advance of the 1987 ANPRM. The review showed that over20% of the approximately 250 vessels in the liftboat fleet had been involvedin reported casualties resulting in the loss of 10 lives, 33 serious injuries,constructive total loss of 13 vessels, and overall physical damage exceeding$20 million. Many of these casualties were directly attributable to designinadequacies or improper operating procedures. The results of the 1987review have been incorporated into the draft Regulatory Evaluation referencedabove under <T2>``ADDRESSES''. </T2>The review is also discussed in more detail inthe following paragraphs. Prior to the 1987 ANPRM, liftboats were regulated primarily under the provisionsof 46 CFR, Subchapter C, which contains safety the provisions of 46 CFR.Subchapter C, which regulations for uninspected vessels. Virtually allliftboats were under 300 gross tons and were, at that time, believed togenerally provide only contract services to the offshore industry; <T3>i.e., </T3>these vessels and their crews were chartered by an operatorto perform a particular function or task in support of offshore drillingor production activities. Since these vessels were less than 300 grosstons and were not known to be carrying passengers and/or freight for hire,they were considered exempt from the requirements for inspection and certificationunder the general provisions of Title 46, U.S.C. (Chapter 33 of SubtitleII).  The high incidence of casualties involving liftboats reflected in the 1987review made it clear that the requirements in 46 CFR, Subchapter C, wereineffective for promoting their safe operation. Further, the review showedthat these vessels have been routinely carrying goods, supplies, equipment,and offshore workers to offshore structures, in addition to performingtheir traditional function as construction and maintenance support vesselsfor offshore structures.  Accordingly, a determination was made to subjectliftboats to Coast Guard inspection as OSVs under 46 U.S.C. 3301(3). Interimguidance for applying the requirements of Subchapters I and T to existingliftboats was recently published in Navigation and Vessel Inspection Circular8-81, Change 1 (NVIC 8-81, CH-1), discussed more fully below. <ITAG tagnum="81">c. Specialized OSVs </ITAG>The 1987 ANPRM proposed that regulations for liftboats and other non-conventionalOSVs be pursued in two distinct phases, <T3>i.e., </T3>phase I to address liftboats and phase II to address specializedOSVs engaged in dive support, painting, and sand blasting, etc. An analysisof the casualty histories and operation of these specialized OSVs, conductedas a part of the effort to prepare this NPRM, shows that, unlike for liftboats,additional regulations are not needed for these vessels. The requirementsbeing proposed for new conventional OSVs should be sufficient to promotethe safe operation of these specialized vessels. Consequently, the CoastGuard does not intend to take further specific action on phase II of the1987 ANPRM.<ITAG tagnum="81">d. Existing OSVs </ITAG>The Coast Guard has historically made an effort to allow owners and operatorsof existing vessels, coming under inspection for certification for thefirst time, to continue operation without being unduly penalized by newlypromulgated regulations, provided their operations can be conducted safely.Existing conventional OSVs, including pre-1979 OSVs, are inspected andcertificated under guidance provided in Navigation and Vessel InspectionCircular (NVIC) 8-81, ``Initial and Subsequent Inspection of UncertificatedOffshore Supply Vessels Under Pub. L. 96-378''. Also, additional guidancefor inspecting liftboats has been recently published as Change 1 to NVIC8-81. This additional guidance was developed specifically to address thehazards contributing to the high number of liftboat casualties. Change 1 to NVIC 8-81 extends to liftboats the same considerations permittedfor conventional OSVs, <T3>i.e., </T3>relaxation of certain provisions of 46 CFR Subchapter Ior T. The Coast Guard is conscious of the economic hardship potentiallyimposed upon owners and operators of existing uninspected vessels whencoming under inspection initially. This is especially true for liftboatsbecause of a currently depressed offshore industry. Consequently, in keepingwith the intent of Pub. L. 96-378, existing liftboats are treated differentlythan new liftboats. NVIC 8-81, CH-1, does not address some areas that canonly be addressed in the design stage, such as main hull strength and damagestability, since modification of existing vessels to meet recognized standardsin these and other areas is very costly. NVIC 8-81, CH-1, does not generallyrequire modification of an existing liftboat, but may limit the area andconditions of operation based upon the vessel design, including leg strengthand stability. There are in excess of 50 liftboats that have recently appliedfor initial inspection for certification using the guidance of NVIC 8-81,CH-1. Change 1 to NVIC 8-81 includes specific guidance on the following topicsas they relate to liftboats; 1. Specific stability and structural criteria, including leg strength.2. A vessel operating manual, readily usable by the crew, addressing variousoperating modes under differing environmental and loading conditions. 3. Liftboat jacking systems. 4. Lifesaving equipment. 5. Firefighting equipment. 6. Minimum crew provisions. Both NVIC 8-81 and 8-81, Change 1 are available for inspection and copyingin the public docket. Also, copies may be obtained by contacting: CommandingOfficer, Marine Safety Center, 2100 Second St. SW., Washington DC 20593-0100,Attn: NVICs, Phone: (202) 267-0444/0795. The cost of NVIC 8-81 is $2.50and the cost of NVIC 8-81, CH-1, is $1.75. Payment for these orders mayonly be made by check or money order payable, in advance, in U.S. dollars,to ``Treasury of the United States''. <ITAG tagnum="81">e. Intent </ITAG>The regulations proposed in this NPRM would apply to new OSVs, <T3>i.e., </T3>OSVs contracted for after final regulations are publishedand take effect. Additionally, existing OSVs, including pre-1979 OSVs,would have the option of being certificated under these proposed regulations.Many of the regulations in this proposal are similar to corresponding requirementsin 46 CFR Subchapters I and T. Every effort has been made to select themost appropriate of these regulations to apply to OSVs. Where possible,existing regulations have been modified to consider the unique operationof OSVs and to recognize many of the policies developed for these vesselsthroughout the years where equivalent levels of safety have been demonstrated.Editorial modifications have also been made in instances where existingregulations are confusing or not clear enough to explain proposed applicationto an OSV. The regulations in this NPRM that would apply specifically to liftboatsaddress many of the same provisions listed above for NVIC 8-81, CH-1. Thelarge majority of existing vessels have applied for restricted servicebased upon their original designs. However, new liftboats would enjoy awider and less restrictive scope of operation than those certificated usingthe guidance of NVIC 8-81, CH-1, because structural strength and stabilitystandards proposed in this NPRM would be considered prior to construction.<ITAG tagnum="81">f. Associated Regulatory Projects </ITAG>There are several rulemaking projects currently under development thatwould apply to OSVs. As those projects are completed, the regulations inthis NPRM would be revised accordingly. The following ongoing regulatoryprojects have been taken into account in preparing this NPRM: (1) CGD 84-069 ``Lifesaving Equipment'', which proposes to consolidatelifesaving regulations presently found in individual vessel subchaptersin a new Subchapter W. The proposed lifesaving requirements in Part 128of the 1983 ANPRM have been removed from this NPRM as a result. Many ofthe proposed requirements for inspection and testing of lifesaving equipmentand the proposed requirements for drills in the NPRM for CGD 84-069 aresimilar to provisions in this NPRM. Proposed Subchapter W was publishedas an NPRM on April 21, 1989, 54 FR 16198. (2) CGD 83-026(a) ``Fire Protection Equipment'', which similarly proposesto consolidate existing fire protection requirements presently found inindividual vessel subchapters in a new Subchapter K. The fire protectionrequirements in Part 132 of this NPRM would be affected and eventuallyrelocated. (3) CGD 79-059 ``Offshore Cranes''. This project addresses crane certification,periodic testing, and operator qualifications for offshore cranes and waspublished as a notice of proposed rulemaking on February 14, 1986 (51 FR5547). (4) CGD 85-080 ``Small Passenger Vessel Inspection and Certification''was published as an NPRM on January 30, 1989; 54 FR 4412. Many of the proposalsin this NPRM are similar to the proposed requirements in CGD 85-080. (5) CGD 82-004(a) ``Alternative Provisions for Reinspection of OffshoreSupply Vessels in Foreign Ports'' was published as an NPRM on May 17, 1988(53 FR 17477). (6) CGD 84-043 ``Portable Tanks for the Transportation of Hazardous Materialsby Vessel''. This project addresses the carriage of hazardous materialsin portable tanks, often utilized on OSVs. (7) CGD 87-031 ``Posting Requirements on Inspected Vessels'' was publishedas an ANPRM November 24, 1987 (52 FR 31786). The requirements of the Final Rules listed below have been incorporatedinto this NPRM. (8) CGD 81-030 ``Vital System Automation'' was published as a Final Ruleon May 18, 1988, (53 FR 17820). (9) CGD 84-024 ``Intervals for Drydocking and Tailshaft Examination onInspected Vessels'' was published as a Final Rule on August 24, 1988, (53FR 32225). Drydocking and associated inspection intervals proposed in thisNPRM are similar to CGD 84-024. (10) CGD 87-013 ``Anchor Requirements for Certain Vessels'', was publishedas a Final Rule on June 6, 1988 (53 FR 20623). (11) CGD 80-044 ``Hazardous Materials Used as Ship's Stores'' was publishedas a Final Rule on March 10, 1988 (53 FR 7745).(12) CGD 87-031a ``Posting Requirement for Placard of Lifesaving Signalsand Breeches Buoy Instructions, Form CG-811'' was published as a FinalRule on July 22, 1988 (53 FR 27686). (13) CGD 81-059 ``Licensing of Maritime Personnel'', which includes manningrequirements for Offshore Supply Vessels. These requirements were publishedas a Final Rule on January 4, 1989 (54 FR 125). (14) CGD 84-099 ``Operating a Vessel While Intoxicated'' was publishedas a Final Rule on December 14, 1987 (52 FR 47526). (15) CGD 86-067 ``Programs for Chemical Drug and Alcohol Testing on CommercialVessel Personnel'' was published as a Final Rule on November 21, 1988 (53FR 47064). <ITAG tagnum="81">g.

Discussion of Specific Provisions, Including Comments on the 1983ANPRM </ITAG>Section 125.110 Hazardous Materials in Bulk The 1983 ANPRM proposed carriage of Grades D and E combustibles in amountsnot to exceed 20% of an OSV's deadweight. Two commenters stated that this20% limitation was a severe reduction in the quantities of these productsthat have been traditionally and safely carried in OSVs. The 20% limitationhas been in effect since 1979 when the Coast Guard first defined ``limitedquantities'' as specified in andSection; 90.05-35. However, the Coast Guardreviewed the casualty history of OSVs and there was no mention of GradeE drilling fluids in any casualty report. Further, carriage of below deckliquid cargo, such as Grade E drilling fluids, is considered to be as safean operation, if not safer, than carriage of above deck cargo on an OSV.Therefore,  the proposed 20% limitation on the carriage of Grade E drillingfluids and fuel has been deleted in the NPRM.The International Maritime Organization (IMO) Subcommittee on Bulk Chemicalshas finalized <T3>Guidelines for the Transport and Handling of Limited Amounts of Hazardousand Noxious Liquid Substances in Bulk on Offshore Support Vessels. The</T3><T3>Guidelines </T3>have been approved by the Marine Environment ProtectionCommittee and submitted to the Maritime Safety Committee for concurrenceand forwarding to the Assembly for final approval. The effective date internationallywill be six months after adoption by the Assembly. The <T3>Guidelines </T3>would apply to a restricted group of hazardous and/ornoxious liquids, including flammable liquids with a flashpoint not exceeding60 degrees C., when carried in bulk on offshore ``support'' vessels andwould recommend alternative standards from the rules contained in the InternationalCode for the Construction and Equipment of Ships Carrying Dangerous Chemicalsin Bulk and International Code for the Construction and Equipment of ShipsCarrying Liquefied Gases in Bulk. The basic provisions of the <T3>Guidelines </T3>would limit carriage of hazardous and/or noxious liquidsin bulk to a volume corresponding to 40% of an OSV's deadweight, usinga cargo specific gravity of 1.0 but, not more than a volume of 800 cubicmeters. The Coast Guard intends to implement the <T3>Guidelines </T3>after they become applicable internationally. The standardsin the <T3>Guidelines </T3> be incorporated into these proposed rules at a laterdate. The <T3>Guidelines </T3>have been included in the rulemaking docket. Personsdesiring to view the <T3>Guidelines </T3>or comment on them may do so by following the proceduresunder <T2>``ADDRESSES'' </T2>above. Section 126.180 Carriage of offshore workers While the primary purpose of an OSV is not the carriage of offshore workersto and from offshore activities, it has traditionally been one of theirexpected functions. The method of transportation currently used to travelto and from most platforms and MODUs is helicopter, but OSVs may be usedto ferry offshore workers when the drilling contractor does not providehelicopter services or when helicopters can not fly, such as at night orduring severe weather. The flexibility to carry offshore workers is seenas essential to the role of the OSV. The 1983 ANPRM proposed to allow up to 150 offshore workers to be carriedon an OSV. Existing OSVs typically carry up to 16 offshore workers anddo not have the need or the space to carry the large number of offshoreworkers proposed in the 1983 ANPRM. This NPRM proposes to allow up to 36offshore workers to be carried in order to allow increased flexibilityfor new OSVs consistent with the stability standards being proposed forthese vessels. For additional discussion, see the explanation of proposedandSection; 174.205 below. Section 126.250 Period of Validity The 1983 ANPRM proposed that an OSV over 100 gross tons be fully inspectedat least once every 3 years, coupled with one reinspection during each3 year inspection period. The purpose of the reinspection was to assurecompliance with 46 U.S.C. 3307(3), which requires that each OSV 100 grosstons and over be inspected every two years. The NPRM has been revised torequire an inspection for certification every two years for these vessels,with one reinspection during the two year period. Reconsideration of the3 year inspection interval and the procedures involved in conducting areinspection during the 3 year inspection period led to the conclusionthat a reinspection would not suffice as an adequate biennial inspectionof the type mandated by 46 U.S.C. 3307(3). The ANPRM also proposed a three year inspection interval for vessels under100 gross tons, as permitted by 46 U.S.C. 3307(2). The casualty historyfor OSVs under 100 gross tons does not indicate that a 3 year inspectioninterval is appropriate. Consequently, the NPRM has been revised to requirea two year inspection interval for these vessels. Section 127.280 Construction and Arrangement of Crew and Offshore WorkerSpaces One comment on the 1983 ANPRM recommended that minimum standards specifyingcrew and offshore worker accommodations be included. The comment suggested30 square feet per crew member on vessels over 100 gross tons and 20 squarefeet per crew member on vessels under 100 gross tons. Where berths areprovided for offshore workers a 20 square foot minimum was recommended.The comment further recommended that four crew members be allowed per room.The ANPRM included no minimum space requirements other than requiring quartersand accommodations to be of sufficient size and to be provided with suitableequipment. The Coast Guard concurs with the intent of this recommendationas minimum specifications will ensure suitable habitability conditions.This section has been revised to include specific requirements for vessels100 gross tons and over. On such vessels, quarters would be required forcrew essentially as proposed by the commenter, and for offshore workers,as well, when the intended operation is to exceed 24 hours in duration.Quarters for offshore workers would not be permitted to berth more than6, would be required to provide at least 20 square feet of deck area, atleast a volume of 140 cubic feet per person accommodated, and clear headroomof at least 6 feet 3 inches. These proposed rules are similar to currentpolicy. The proposed requirements for crew quarters are similar to thoseof 46 CFR Subchapter I. No specific requirements are included for vessels less than 100 gross tons.Current policy regarding vessels less than 100 gross tons operating insupport of the offshore industry is to leave the suitability of quartersto the cognizant Officer in Charge, Marine Inspection. This policy hasbeen incorporated in the NPRM. <ITAG tagnum="52">Part 127_Subpart D_Window Construction and Visibility </ITAG>Glass and other glazing material used in windows would have to be of thetype that would not break into dangerous fragments if fractured. Additionally,they would have to be strong enough to withstand wave and wind loads appropriatefor the intended location. Pilothouse windows would have to comply withan industry standard which prescribes minimum light transmission and maximumdistortion. Currently, there are no requirements for window visibility.Present Coast Guard policy is to require design calculations and justificationof window strength if the windows could be subject to wave loading. An industry standard for window visibility would be incorporated by reference.This subpart is similar to that of proposed Subchapter T.Lifesaving Equipment The ANPRM contained detailed requirements for lifesaving equipment. Thoserequirements have been removed in this NPRM, as previously stated. Proposed46 CFR Subchapter W will contain requirements for lifesaving equipmentfor OSVs. Consistent with the revised inspection, testing, and drill requirementsthat accompany Subchapter W, additional rules are proposed in this NPRMin andSection; 126.350 and Part 133, Subparts B, C, D, and E. Additionally,andSection; 199.405 would exempt liftboats from the requirements for launchingappliances for liferafts. Rescue Boat Two commenters on the 1983 ANPRM discussed the practicality of a requirementfor a rescue boat. One comment recommended that rescue boats be requiredin all cases. A second comment recommended that the rescue boat requirementbe deleted entirely as rescue boats are cumbersome to maneuver in roughseas and are, therefore, of little value. This comment stated that currentOSVs have greater maneuverability, lower freeboards, and adequate visibilityfrom the bridge to enable rescues with the use of life floats. Section 199.262 of proposed Subchapter W would require a rescue boat foran OSV in ocean service unless exempted by the provisions of andSection;199.410. (An inflatable rescue boat could meet the requirements for therescue boat required by proposed andSection; 199.262, if approved by theCommandant (G-MVI) as meeting the requirements of Regulation III/30.2 andIII/47 of SOLAS). Section 199.410 would allow certain special purpose ships,including OSVs, to be exempt from the requirements for rescue boats.  <ITAG tagnum="56">Part 128_Marine Engineering Equipment and Systems </ITAG>The proposed marine engineering equipment and systems requirements arebased on 46 CFR Subchapter F. Considering the size of OSVs, strict compliancewith Subchapter F is not considered necessary. In order to provide moreflexibility to designers and builders, relaxations and equivalencies havebeen established over the years and have been implemented in the form ofpolicy statements. The requirements in this part reflect many of thosepolicy statements. In summary, Class II piping systems are divided intotwo categories; vital and non-vital. Class II non-vital piping systemswould not be required to comply with the material and pressure design requirementsof Subchapter F; whereas, Class II vital piping systems would be requiredto comply with those requirements, but flexibility would be given in theselection of materials for required systems. A Class I piping system wouldcontinue to be required to comply with Subchapter F. Section 128.310 Fuel Fuel would be required to have a flashpoint exceeding 110 degrees F. Thiswould preclude propulsion engines or auxiliaries from being powered bygasoline, except engines for rescue boats. Current rules do not containsuch a requirement. Diesel engines are already the industry standard andthis requirement is not expected to cause an inconvenience but is addedas a safety consideration. Section 128.450 Liquid Mud Systems  Liquid mud systems, including Grade E liquid mud systems, would be allowedto have resiliently seated valves of the Category A type. This would affectvessels over 100 gross tons, since smaller vessels generally do not carrydrilling fluids due to space limitations. Currently, 46 CFR SubchapterF requires a valve with a metal to metal seat. Liquid mud is abrasive andover the course of time scores the metal to metal seating surfaces of shutoffvalves requiring replacement or disassembly and repair. <ITAG tagnum="56">Part 129_Electrical Engineering Equipment and Systems </ITAG>The requirements of 46 CFR Subchapter J (Electrical Engineering Regulations)are proposed for vessels 100 gross tons and over. Where appropriate, relaxationshave been made to those requirements to allow less costly installationsand provide for less complicated electrical distribution systems. Strictcompliance with Subchapter J is not considered necessary for vessels lessthan 100 gross tons. The proposed electrical engineering requirements forthese vessels are similar to those in proposed Subchapter T. <ITAG tagnum="56">Part 130_Marine Engineering Equipment and Systems </ITAG>Part 130 includes requirements for automation of unattended machinery spaces.These requirements would apply only to OSVs of 100 gross tons and over.In general, the guidelines in NVIC 1-78, ``Automation of Offshore SupplyVessels of 100 Gross Tons and Over,'' have been restated in this part.Section 130.120 Propulsion Machinery Controls Each OSV would be required to have propulsion controls in the pilothouse.This requirement is added to specify existing industry standard practice.Currently, there is no requirement for pilothouse control, although allOSVs are so fitted. Section 130.130 Steering Systems on Vessels Less Than 100 Gross Tons  OSVs less than 100 gross tons would have minimum design requirements underthis proposed rule. Currently, OSVs certificated under 46 CFR SubchapterT must only provide suitable steering apparatus. The proposed rules aresimilar to those in proposed 46 CFR Subchapter T. There is expected tobe little impact on OSV designs because of this proposed rule, since mostexisting OSVs certificated under 46 CFR Subchapter T meet its provisions.Section 130.140 Steering Systems on Vessels of 100 Gross Tons and OverOSVs would be required to be equipped with a steering system meeting therequirements of 46 CFR Subchapter F, as currently required by 46 CFR SubchapterI, or have a hydraulic helm unit. Provisions for steering the vessel whengoing astern would be required for vessels with a hydraulic helm unit.Since the mid 1970's, the Coast Guard has accepted hydraulic helm unitson OSVs. These units are relatively simple mechanically and have provento be reliable. Most OSVs are already equipped with hydraulic helm unitsand many have steering stations within the pilothouse arranged for operationwhen facing aft over the weather deck, for use when backing up to an offshoreplatform or MODU. Sections 130.130 and 130.140 Steering Gear For vessels less than 100 gross tons, the steering system must be ableto shift the rudder from 35 degrees on one side to 30 degrees on the otherside in 28 seconds or less while moving ahead at the maximum service speed.For vessels 100 gross tons and over, each of two main steering pumps anddrive motors must be able to meet that same performance standard. Whilethis requirement has not been applied to OSVs previously, existing OSVsalready meet this performance standard. The purpose of this proposed requirementis to specify what is considered to be the minimum level of performancefor a steering system on OSVs which operate in coastal waters where congestionis heaviest.Section 130.310 Radar Each OSV 100 gross tons and over would be required to be equipped witha general marine radar. It is believed that in excess of 95% of existingOSVs of this size are presently equipped with radar. However, the requirementis included to ensure all new vessels over 100 gross tons meet the minimumlevel of safety considered necessary by the industry and the Coast Guard.This proposed requirement is contained in proposed 46 CFR Subchapter Tfor some small passenger vessels. The proposed requirements for radar andother navigational equipment in andSection; 130.130 satisfy the NationalTransportation Safety Board recommendation M-78-074: Require vessels carryingmore than six passengers for hire and engaged in the offshore oil industryto have electronic navigation equipment including radar, loran and a fathometer.This proposed rule is also in keeping with the intent of their recommendationsM-87-003 and M-84-024 for increased navigational equipment on vessels onextended routes. Section 130.320 Electronic Position Fixing Device Each OSV in ocean or coastwise service would be required to be equippedwith an appropriate electronic position fixing device. There is presentlyno such requirement. The importance of this equipment has been recognizedby industry since most OSVs over 100 gross tons are already so equipped.Section 131.350 Station Bill A station bill would be required for each OSV with a required crew of four(04) or more, including the master, by this proposed rule. A station billhas not been required for OSVs previously because it was felt that thesmall number of crew enabled the master to keep all crew members informedof their duties. Frequent crew changes distinguish OSVs from other vessels.A station bill is considered necessary to ensure that the master formallyassigns responsibilities to the crew. This will also ensure that offshoreworkers know who is in charge of mustering them in the event they mustabandon ship. The benefit that results from this proposal is better organizationand less confusion during an emergency. Section 131.330 Emergency Instructions An emergency instruction placard is not now required for OSVs, but wouldbe required under this proposal. Such a placard would provide the crewand offshore workers with relevant information concerning proper proceduresand precautions to take in emergency situations. The emergency instructionplacard would be required to address the particular equipment, arrangementand operation of each individual vessel. This placard is considered necessarydue to the number of offshore workers that would be permitted and the amountof turn over in workers for offshore jobs. The benefit of this requirementwould be assurance that each of the crew and each offshore worker had atleast a minimum of information on emergency situations available and wouldprevent confusion in the event of an emergency situation. <ITAG tagnum="52">Part 174_Subpart G Stability </ITAG>This rulemaking proposes watertight integrity and stability requirementsspecific to OSVs. For requirements that are applicable to all vessel types,it refers to 46 CFR Part 170. Section 174.185 Intact Stability Requirements The stability criteria proposed in this section is a righting energy analysiswhich has been applied by the Coast Guard to OSVs since 1974. As an alternativeto this criterion, the proposed regulation would permit compliance withandSection; 170.173 of Subchapter S, which is similar to the IMO recommendedcriterion for OSV's contained in Resolution A.469(XII). Sections 174.195 Machinery Space Bulkheads and 174.200 Machinery SpaceDamage Stability Each OSV would be required by these sections to show that it could surviveside damage with a 30 inch transverse extent (penetration) of damage betweenthe forward and aft engine room bulkheads. Because of engine room size, most existing OSV designs could not meet thedamage survival requirements proposed if the engine room were assumed damaged.Survival of the proposed side damage in the area of the engine room couldbe met if the engine room were not flooded or if the size of the engineroom were decreased. Designers of OSVs do not expect to reduce the sizeof already cramped engine rooms, but instead would find a method of meetingthe damage requirements by preventing the assumed damage from extendinginto the engine room. To prevent the engine room from being flooded, theremust be longitudinal bulkheads outboard of the engine room for the lengthof the engine room with no access to the engine room within 30 inches ofthe side shell. No major changes are expected to existing OSV designs asa result of these proposed requirements since nearly all OSV designs currentlyinclude wing tanks outboard of the engine room. This proposal is in keeping with IMO Resolution A.469(XII) and should notrequire major redesign of OSVs. Review of casualty data has shown thatdamage to the engine room in low energy type collisions with fixed objectsis the most likely cause of loss of the vessel due to uncontrolled flooding.A vessel designed to meet the 30 inch collision penetration standard inthe engine room would be less likely to be lost due to minor collisiondamage.Section 174.205 Additional Damage Stability Requirements Each vessel carrying more than 16 offshore workers would be required todemonstrate survival of side damage with a 30 inch transverse extent ofdamage anywhere throughout the length of the vessel except in locationshaving transverse watertight bulkheads. This is a change from the 1983 ANPRM which would have allowed up to 150offshore workers to be carried but require the transverse extent of damageto be B/5 (where B is the maximum beam of the vessel at the deepest draft).In reducing the number of offshore workers that would be permitted on anOSV, the level of subdivision and damage stability was reconsidered. TheB/5 transverse extent of damage was reduced to 30 inches and is consideredto be a reasonable level of safety for vessels of this size, configuration,and operating method carrying the limited number of offshore workers proposed.Review of the casualty history of OSVs shows collisions and groundingsto be of the low energy type. This justifies a reduction to the proposedtransverse extent of damage of 30 inches versus the B/5 value requiredof other vessels of similar size. Section 174.210 Watertight Bulkhead Doors This section proposes to permit Class 1 hinged watertight doors in requiredwatertight bulkheads in lieu of Class 3 sliding watertight doors as requiredin 46 CFR Subchapter S. One comment on the 1983 ANPRM suggested that thissection be modified to require Class 2 sliding watertight doors in lieuof Class 1 hinged watertight doors as specified in the 1983 ANPRM. Transitthrough watertight bulkheads on OSVs is an operational necessity and therequirements proposed in this section are considered to provide an adequatelevel of safety for these vessels, while permitting the necessary operationalflexibility. Requiring a Class 2 watertight door is not considered necessaryas a Class 1 watertight door should provide adequate safety. A second commenter suggested that there was no need for indicating lightson Class 1 doors. This suggestion was not adopted. Class 1 doors wouldbe permitted provided they are equipped with lights which indicate on thebridge if the door is opened or closed. The watertight integrity of subdivisionbulkheads necessitates that doors be opened only when used for transitand indicator lights will allow the vessel operator to ensure that watertightdoors are closed as required. <ITAG tagnum="81">i. Liftboats </ITAG>Discussion of Comments on the 1987 ANPRM for Liftboatsand Proposals Relating to Those Comments The Coast Guard received 14 separate letters in response to the proposalto inspect and certificate liftboats as OSVs. All of the letters expressedgeneral approval of the proposed action. One letter was unsigned and thereforenot included in the docket. Three commenters expressed concern about the impact of new regulationson existing liftboats. The Coast Guard is cognizant of the difficultiesencountered when attempting to impose ``new'' requirements on existingvessels. Consequently, as previously discussed and consistent with theprovisions of this NPRM, owners of existing liftboats will be affordedthe option of complying with these regulations or may choose inspectionunder the previously established alternative means of compliance providedby NVIC 8-81, CH-1. The provisions of NVIC 8-81, CH-1, represent a suitablelevel of safety for existing liftboats and reflect the ``as built'' conditionof these vessels. <T3>Hazardous Materials. </T3>The 1987 ANPRM discussed the possibilityof developing standards for the transportation of hazardous materials aboardliftboats. Carriage of hazardous materials by liftboats does not significantlydiffer from that of conventional OSVs and is adequately addressed by theNPRM. <T3>Crew Requirements. </T3>Licensing, crew requirements, and trainingissues were each mentioned six times. Three comments suggested a reductionin the number of crew currently required for conventional OSVs of correspondingtonnage. These comments stated that liftboat owners/operators have beenpenalized simply because they did not take advantage of certain exemptionsafforded to OSVs under existing admeasurement regulations in 46 CFR, SubchapterG. However, one comment from an operator of a liftboat noted that on numerousoccasions, he and his crew were required to work in excess of 12 hoursa day without benefit of relief. Six commenters suggested that liftboatcrews were not adequately trained to handle all the potential emergencysituations that might be expected to occur. It is apparent from the 1987casualty review that a lack of or insufficient number of qualified crewmembers has contributed to certain liftboat casualties. This NPRM includesprovisions for liftboats to be adequately crewed with properly licensedand documented personnel. The Coast Guard does not agree that owners/operatorsare being unduly penalized because they have not taken advantage of tonnageexemptions. The 1987 casualty review showed that, in many circumstances,even the minimum crew requirements applicable to vessels less than 100gross tons were not being followed. Proposed andSection; 131.1020 would require all OSVs, including liftboats,to be adequately manned as specified by the law and the manning regulationsof 46 CFR Part 15 for OSVs. This requirement incorporates NTSB recommendationM-86-119 to require a liftboat, whether operating on the outer continentalshelf or elsewhere, to be under the control of a licensed officer or operator.This recommendation superseded NTSB recommendation M-85-113 for the CoastGuard to seek legislative authority to license persons-in-charge of liftboats.Since liftboats have been determined to be OSVs, as previously discussed,no additional authority is needed. <T3>Stability. </T3>Five comments were received concerning liftboat stability.Four of the five commenters favored adoption of the 70 knot wind heelingcriteria already in effect for certain MODUs in 46 CFR, Subchapter S. Onecommenter recommended consideration of a 50 knot criteria. Stability ofliftboats is a critical concern, particularly when the vessels are in atransition mode to or from an elevated condition. Proposed 46 CFR 174,Subpart H would require liftboats in ``restricted'' service to meet a 70knot severe storm criteria and a 60 knot criteria for normal operatingconditions. Liftboats in ``unrestricted'' service would have to meet a100 knot criteria for severe storm conditions and a 70 knot criteria fornormal operating conditions. Additionally, liftboats would be requiredto meet the intact and damage stability criteria for OSVs of Part 174,Subpart G. Regardless of route, liftboats would be required to demonstratea downward force on each footing when supported on the bottom under a 100knot wind for severe storm conditions, and a 70 knot wind for normal operatingconditions. The proposed requirements comply with NTSB recommendation M-85-112 to establishstability criteria for liftboats. Casualties occurring while elevated orwhen in transition to or from an elevated position have resulted in 45%of the total liftboat casualties reported, 70% of the associated deaths,and in excess of 60% of the total monetary loss. <T3>Leg Strength. </T3>Five comments were received concerning liftboatleg strength. All pointed to the lack of an established industry standardand a need for one. The commenters suggested developing a required constantvalue for the ``K'' factor, or effective length factor, for use with therules of the American Bureau of Shipping for leg strength. This ``K'' factoraccounts for support conditions at the seabed and essentially determinesthe maximum safe length of leg permitted between the jacking guide structureof the liftboat and the seabed while elevated. Suggested values for thisconstant ranged from 1.65 to 2.0. One commenter also indicated that legstrength design criteria should be ``certified at the expense of the owner.''The NPRM proposes to adopt the leg strength criteria applicable to self-elevatingMODUs contained in the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) ``Rules for MobileOffshore Drilling Units'' with an effective length factor, ``K'', of notless than 2.0.Proposed andSection; 127.110 would require plans of liftboat legs, detailsof supporting structure, and calculations to be submitted for review andapproval. Liftboat leg failures have accounted for approximately 18% ofthe total liftboat casualties reviewed and account for 23% of the monetaryloss from these casualties. <T3>Jacking Systems. </T3>Five comments were received concerning liftboatjacking systems. Four of the five comments suggested certain inherent problemswith the hydraulics employed and recommended that requirements be promulgatedto make them ``fail-safe''. The fifth comment recommended installationof an audible alarm to signal development of a potentially hazardous adverselist or trim condition. One commenter included a recommendation that theAmerican Gear Manufacturers Association (AGMA) Standard 218.01 ``Ratingthe Pitting Resistance and Bending Strength of Spur and Helical InvoluteGear Teeth'' be adopted to assure that a reasonable criteria be employedin the design of any given rack and pinion jacking system. Proposed andSection; 126.340, andSection; 126.430, and andSection; 128.130 recognizethat liftboat jacking systems are critical elements of these vessels andhave a documented history of failure, totaling approximately 16% of thecasualties identified in the 1987 casualty review and 20% of the deaths.Consequently, they are identified as ``vital'' systems and would be thoroughlyinspected at the initial inspection for certification and at each subsequentinspection for certification. This would serve to reduce the number ofcasualties involving liftboat jacking systems. Proposed andSection; 128.240 would address the standards to which all liftboathydraulic systems must be designed including the hydraulic jacking systems.Proposed andSection; 128.460 would incorporate AGMA Standard 218.01 by referenceto assist a designer in determining minimum jacking system gear strength.Additionally, it would require that each jacking system be designed andconstructed so that any single component failure will not result in thevessel's uncontrolled descent. Proposed andSection; 130.210 would require that each control system for aliftboat jacking system be designed so that loss of power or failure ofany one component will sound a visual and audible alarm and will not resultin the vessel's uncontrolled descent. <T3>Operating Manual. </T3>Four comments advised that there is little informationavailable to the liftboat operator with respect to (1) changing operatingmodes, (2) adding required preload ballast to achieve adequate leg penetrationinto the seabed, (3) calculating deck load, and (4) addressing the myriadof emergency situations that may confront personnel aboard the vessel.All felt most of this could be satisfactorily addressed in an operatingmanual, which would be readily accessible and usable by the crew. The NPRMproposes to require that an approved operating manual be on board all liftboats.Proposed andSection; 131.1085 would require each liftboat to have a CoastGuard approved operating manual readily available and usable by the person-in-chargeand the crew. This requirement incorporates NTSB recommendations M-84-004and M-85-114 for the Coast Guard to require a liftboat to have an operatingmanual which sets forth the operating limitations while engaged in outercontinental shelf activities with respect to imposed environmental, loading,and stability conditions. The 1987 casualty review indicated that liftboatsmay become hazardous when operated beyond design limitations. The operatingmanual proposed would explain the operating limits and provide guidancepertaining to various emergency situations. <T3>Cranes. </T3>Three commenters stated that cranes have proven to bean inherent safety hazard on liftboats and indicated there are no industrywide safety standards followed concerning the installation, testing, andservicing of these devices. Proposed andSection; 126.140 would require liftboat cranes to be designed,installed, maintained, and tested in accordance with the same provisionsestablished for MODUs, specifically the American Petroleum Institute (API)Recommended Practices (RP) 2C and 2D. <ITAG tagnum="84">Draft Regulatory Evaluation </ITAG>These proposed regulations are considered to be non-major under ExecutiveOrder 12291 on Federal Regulation and significant under DOT regulatorypolicies and procedures (44 FR 11034, February 26, 1979). A draft regulatoryevaluation has been prepared and placed in the rulemaking docket. It maybe inspected and copied at the address listed under <T2>ADDRESSES</T2>. Copies may also be obtained by contacting the personlisted under <T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT</T2>.<T3>Costs for Conventional OSVs. </T3>As of December 1987, there were 584OSVs certificated, 407 of which were over 100 gross tons. In evaluatingthe effect of these proposed regulations, all additional costs and benefitsof these regulations were assumed in constant dollars. The cost to construct a conventional OSV under these proposed regulationscompared to existing regulations, expressed as a percentage of the initialconstruction cost for each OSV would be: Approximately 2.3% for conventional OSVs less than 100 gross tons. Approximately 0.5% for conventional OSVs 100 gross tons and over. Assuming 90 large OSVs and 50 small OSVs would be built in the 6 yearsafter these proposed rules become effective, the cost of these proposedregulations to the OSV industry would be approximately $0.8 million peryear. The principal benefits of these regulations would be a vessel better equipped,with the authorization to carry more than twice as many offshore workersand twice as much liquid drilling fluid, increased safety for offshoreworkers and crew due to the damage stability requirements, a vessel lesslikely to suffer damage that would result in total loss of the vessel,and a crew better prepared to deal with emergencies. The economic benefitof the safety improvements and operational flexibility offered by theseproposed rules is difficult to quantify, as they are dependent on vesseldesign, operational procedures, and contractual arrangements. However,based upon the modest assumption that these regulations would result ina 30% reduction in damage costs associated with vessel casualties, it isestimated that the overall benefits of these proposed regulations wouldmore than offset the additional construction costs imposed. <T3>Costs for Liftboats. </T3>It is anticipated that the proposed regulationsfor new liftboats would affect small business entities. These vessels havenot been previously required to be designed and built to Coast Guard inspectionstandards. Unlike conventional OSVs, the Coast Guard's experience withliftboats is based primarily on casualty investigations. Therefore, theCoast Guard has no accurate mechanism for determining additional costswhich may be incurred by owners of new liftboats required to meet theseproposed rules. In the 1987 ANPRM, the Coast Guard requested informationconcerning anticipated additional costs that might be borne by liftboatowners and operators resulting from newly imposed inspection requirements.There was no data associated with costs submitted to the docket. Several designers, builders, and owners of liftboats were contacted duringpreparation of this NPRM. The individuals contacted estimated that a largeliftboat of less than 300 gross tons with legs 200 feet in length wouldcost between $2-$4 million to design and construct. The cost to designand construct a liftboat less than 100 gross tons was estimated to be approximately$1 million. These individuals believe that if new regulations were consideredin the initial design, the impact of non-recurring costs associated withconstruction of a liftboat would be minimal_not more than 5% above thecurrent estimated construction cost. This additional construction costwould amount to less than $50,000 for a liftboat less than 100 gross tonsand between $100,000 and $200,000 for a liftboat more than 100 gross tons.Examples of additional non-recurring costs that would be incurred as aresult of this NPRM include: 1. Submittal of vessel plans to the Coast Guard. 2. Preparation and submittal of a comprehensive operating manual to theCoast Guard. 3. Design and construction of a fail-safe jacking system. 4. Upgrading of raw water intake piping systems to supply the firemainsystems while elevated. 5. Compliance with increased lifesaving equipment requirements. There would be no recurring costs to liftboat operators associated withthese proposed rules, in addition to costs already being incurred by existingliftboats. Recurring costs associated with crew salaries, periodic testingand drydocking, and other expenses due to biennial inspections and reinspectionswould not be affected by the regulations proposed in this NPRM.The benefit of casualties and fatalities prevented is the savings to theliftboat industry offered by these proposed rules and is drawn from theannual averages for the liftboat fleet for the period 1981 to 1986. Ifthese rules reduce the average cost per casualty for liftboats to a valuecomparable to conventional OSVs, this will mean a reduction of approximately75-87% in the cost of casualties to liftboats. This reduced cost of casualtieswill amount to approximately $72,900 for a liftboat less than 100 grosstons which exceeds the estimated $50,000 additional design, construction,and outfitting costs. Similarly, for liftboats over 100 gross tons, thereduced cost of casualties will be approximately $183,100, which is withinthe range of the expected cost increase of $100,000-$200,000. It is difficult to gauge the impact of these proposed rules on the liftboatindustry as a whole since there are no plans for new liftboat constructionaccording to those consulted and the Coast Guard has only informal estimatesof the additional construction costs which may be incurred. New liftboatswould enjoy some unquantifiable benefits heretofore limited to conventionalOSVs, <T3>i.e., </T3>carriage of unlimited quantities of Grade E liquid drillingfluids and up to 36 offshore workers. These unquantifiable benefits whenadded to the anticipated reductions in casualty costs discussed above,outweigh the estimated additional construction costs. As previously stated, information concerning additional costs that maybe borne by the liftboat industry as a result of this NPRM is limited.Specific cost data concerning compliance with these proposed rules is requested.All economic information submitted before the expiration of the commentperiod will be considered before final action is taken on this proposal.The regulations may be changed in light of economic data submitted. <ITAG tagnum="84">Environmental Analysis </ITAG>The Coast Guard has considered the environmental impact of this proposedrulemaking and concluded that preparation of an environmental impact statementis not necessary. A draft environmental assessment has been prepared anda finding of no significant impact is anticipated. <ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Assessment </ITAG>This NPRM has been analyzed in accordance with the principles and criteriacontained in Executive Order 12612, and it has been determined that thisproposed rulemaking does not have sufficient federalism implications towarrant the preparation of a Federalism Assessment. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>In accordance with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 through612), the Coast Guard has considered whether this rulemaking is likelyto have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of smallentities. ``Small entities'' include independently owned and operated smallbusinesses which are not dominant in their field and which would otherwisequalify as ``small business concerns'' under section 3 of the Small BusinessAct (15 U.S.C. 632). There are currently 72 owners that own only one conventional OSV (12% ofconventional OSVs). The Coast Guard does not anticipate that there wouldbe more than 17 owners that would own one new OSV (3 per year based upon12% of the anticipated 140 new conventional OSVs to be built in the 6 yearsafter these rules are finalized). The additional out of pocket expensefor initial construction would not exceed 2.5%, as previously discussed,even if none of the operational flexibility or safety improvements (andother unquantifiable benefits) were realized. These proposed rules wouldnot result in additional recurring operational costs. In the case of liftboats, the additional initial construction costs willbe higher, approximately 5% of the estimated construction cost, based uponthe best information available to the Coast Guard. There would be no additionalrecurring cost to liftboat operators due to these proposed rules. Thereare currently 5 liftboat owners that own only one liftboat (2% of the liftboatfleet). The Coast Guard estimates that there would be no more than 1 newliftboat owner with only one liftboat in the 6 years after these rulesare finalized based upon the current percentage.

The tests and inspections under paragraph(b)(3)(i) of this section must also be conducted when each new davit, winch,or other launching appliance is installed on the vessel. The test underparagraph (b)(3)(ii) of this section must also be conducted when each newfreefall lifeboat or rescue boat is installed on the vessel. The inspectionunder paragraph (b)(3)(vi) of this section must also be conducted wheneach new lifeboat, rescue boat, liferaft, davit, winch, or other launchingappliance is installed on the vessel. The test under paragraph (b)(3)(vii)of this section must also be conducted when each new life buoy quick releasedevice is installed on the vessel. (i) Each launching appliance using falls and a winch for a rescue boat,davit-launched liferaft, or lifeboat including any auxiliary davit systemfor a free-fall lifeboat must be tested as follows: (A) The lifeboat, rescue boat or davit-launched liferaft must be loadedwith all of its equipment or the deadweight equivalent. In addition, thedavit-launched liferaft must be loaded with a 165 lb. weight to simulatethe load of one person. A davit-launched liferaft need not be used forthis test if an appropriate test weight is used. The boat or liferaft mustbe lowered from the embarkation station and launched into the water usingthe normal launching procedure. If a test weight is substituted for thedavit-launched liferaft, the weight must be ``launched'' onto a surfacethat will support its weight. The rescue boat must then be loaded withthe deadweight equivalent of its full rescue boat complement using a weightof 165 lb. per person. In the case of a lifeboat or rescue boat launchingappliance, the boat must then be recovered by the launching appliance.In the case of a liferaft launching appliance, the hand-operated quick-returnmechanism must be used to recover the fall. (<T3>1</T3>) There must be no deformation of or damage to the launchingappliance or its connections to the vessel. (<T3>2</T3>) The lowering speed must meet andSection; 199.153(j) of this chapter,and the falls must meet andSection; 199.153(g) of this chapter. For a multipledrum winch, the falls must wind off the drums at the same rate when lowering,and wind onto the drums evenly in a level wrap at the same rate when hoisting.(<T3>3</T3>) The release mechanism control in a boat must open all hookssimultaneously and release the boat into the water. (<T3>4</T3>) The automatic disengaging apparatus for a davit-launched liferaftmust open and release the liferaft or test weight after the apparatus isset to open automatically and the liferaft or test weight is set onto asupporting surface. (<T3>5</T3>) The recovery of the boat must meet andSection; 199.153(1) ofthis chapter, and if the boat is a rescue boat, andSection; 199.160(d) ofthis chapter. (<T3>6</T3>) For each launching device equipped to recover a boat by power,including a launching device with a portable power source, the limit switchesor other safety devices must automatically de-energize power before theboat reaches the stops to avoid overstressing the falls and davits. (<T3>7</T3>) The hand-operated recovery gear for a lifeboat or rescue boatlaunching appliance must be capable of moving the boat into its stowedposition where the boat can be safely and properly secured. (<T3>8</T3>) The operation of the hand-operated quick-return mechanism ona davit-launched liferaft launching appliance must be smooth, rapid, andeasy enough for one person to recover the fall. (B) If the lowering of a lifeboat or rescue boat is controlled from withinthe boat by a control wire wound on an auxiliary drum on the winch, thelaunching of the boat must be tested with the boat loaded as under paragraph(b)(3)(i)(A) of this section, but with an operator inside.(<T3>1</T3>) The mass of the control wire must be sufficient to overcomethe friction of the sheaves used on the control wire when the launchingappliance is being operated by the on-deck controls. (<T3>2</T3>) The control wire must properly operate the winch brake. (<T3>3</T3>) The winch brake must not be affected by the mass of the fullyextended control wire. (<T3>4</T3>) There must be sufficient length of control wire available insidethe boat to operate the winch brake during all stages of lowering.

(C) The test procedure under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(A) of this section mustbe repeated with the lifeboat, rescue boat or liferaft loaded with weightequivalent to all of its equipment and full complement of persons, plus10% of the total weight of the loaded boat or liferaft. In the case ofa davit-launched liferaft, the automatic disengaging apparatus must beset to release. The on-deck launching controls must be used for this test,with the boat or liferaft being stopped after it has reached its maximumlowering speed, and then at approximately 6 foot intervals. In the caseof a lifeboat or rescue boat, when the boat reaches a position just abovethe water, it must be released from the falls using the on-load releasemechanism control. (<T3>1</T3>) There must be no deformation of or damage to the launchingappliance or its connections to the vessel. (<T3>2</T3>) The lowering speed must meet andSection;andSection; 199.153(i)and 199.153(k) of this chapter, and the falls must meet andSection; 199.153(g)of this chapter. (<T3>3</T3>) The launching appliance must bring the boat or raft to a stopwithin 39 inches by application of the brake by the winch counterweightalone. (<T3>4</T3>) The brake action must be smooth and stop the lowering whenapplied. (<T3>5</T3>) The brake must be continually applied unless the operator,or a mechanism activated by the operator, releases the brake control. (<T3>6</T3>) The boat or raft must begin to lower without additional forceeach time the brake is released. (<T3>7</T3>) The release mechanism control in a boat must open all hookssimultaneously and release the boat into the water. (<T3>8</T3>) The automatic disengaging apparatus for a davit-launched liferaftmust not release the liferaft or test weight until the liferaft or testweight is set on the surface of the water, a dock or other supporting surface.(D) The release apparatus for a davit-launched liferaft must be testedto determine that it will release under a towing strain. The liferaft ortest weight loaded as required under paragraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this sectionmust be suspended just above the surface and the release apparatus setto open automatically. A horizontal towing strain sufficient to pull thefalls 5anddegrees; from vertical must be applied to the liferaft or testweight and the liferaft lowered. The release apparatus must release theliferaft or test weight as it is set onto the supporting surface. (E) If any winch brake surface is exposed to the weather, the test underparagraph (b)(3)(i)(C) of this section must be conducted with the brakesurfaces dry and repeated with the brake surfaces wet. The brake must stopthe winch when the brake surface is wet, but the stopping distance requirementdoes not apply. (ii) Each free-fall launched lifeboat and launching system must be testedas follows with the vessel at its lightest seagoing draft: (A) The lifeboat loaded with only its normal equipment or the deadweightequivalent of the equipment, must be launched into the water. After launching,the boat must be retrieved and examined. (<T3>1</T3>) The free-fall release mechanism must operate properly and releasethe boat from the launching appliance. (<T3>2</T3>) The launching system must operate smoothly, must launch theboat into the water at the intended angle, and must not show any evidenceof improper operation. (<T3>3</T3>) The lifeboat must not show any evidence of instability in theair or in the water. (<T3>4</T3>) There must be no deformation of or damage to the lifeboat,the launching appliance or its connections to the vessel. (B) The procedure under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section must berepeated with each seat in the lifeboat loaded with 165 lb. of deadweightproperly secured in place to simulate the weight of one person. (<T3>1</T3>) The inspections required under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(A)(<T3>1</T3>) through (b)(3)(ii)(A)(<T3>4</T3>) of this section must be performed. (<T3>2</T3>) Each seat and its mounting arrangement is closely inspectedby the marine inspector. There must be no deformation or damage to anyseat or its mounting arrangements. (<T3>3</T3>) If the marine inspector has reason to believe that the boatis not being launched in a safe and proper manner, the inspector may orderthe test under this paragraph (paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(B) of this section)to be repeated with the boat instrumented with acceleration monitoringequipment. The data must be compared with the approval test data to determinewhether or not the boat is being launched in a safe and proper manner.(C) The procedure under paragraph (b)(3)(ii)(A) of this section must berepeated with at least one operator aboard the lifeboat. The rest of theseats in the lifeboat must be empty, loaded with deadweight, or with personnelto the satisfaction of the inspector. The launching of the lifeboat mustbe completely controlled by the personnel in the lifeboat. (<T3>1</T3>) The inspections required under paragraphs (b)(3)(ii)(A)(<T3>1</T3>) through (b)(3)(ii)(A)(<T3>4</T3>) of this section must be performed. (<T3>2</T3>) There must be no injury to any of the personnel in the lifeboat.(iii) Each lifeboat and rescue boat must be operated in the water for atleast 2 hours.
