The payments, detailed in a new report to the Senate BankingCommittee obtained Thursday, included $57,500 more to formerDepartment and Housing and Urban Development official JosephStrauss, by far the most highly paid known HUD consultant with morethan $1.7 million in fees in the last five years.   The report by HUD's inspector general also revealed additionalpayments to two prominent Republicans, political consultant LouKitchin and Frederick Bush, the top fundraiser for President Bush'scampaign. Frederick Bush's nomination for an ambassadorial post wasdoomed by disclosures about his role in influence peddling at theagency.   Meanwhile, Stuart Weisberg, staff director of the Housesubcommittee investigating the HUD scandal, said subpoenas orderingformer HUD Secretary Samuel Pierce to appear before the panel werebeing formally served with Pierce's lawyers late Thursday.   The subcommittee voted unanimously Tuesday to subpoena Pierce totestify on at least three occasions, the first next Tuesday, as partof the congressional investigaiton into the department's problems.Weisberg said Pierce's attorneys had agreed to accept the subpoenason behalf of Pierce.   Payments to five consultants not identified in previous reportswere discovered during a follow-up investigation by HUD auditors.Those payments totaled $128,000, a relatively small amount comparedto the huge fees paid to more prominent consultants.   All of the $6 million in consulting fees were paid since late1983 by developers seeking subsidies from HUD's Section 8 ModerateRehabilitation Program. It was an April audit of that program thattriggered the current congressional, internal and Justice Departmentinvestigations of fraud, mismanagement and influence peddling at HUDduring the Reagan administration.   The April audit identified $4.2 million in fees paid toconsultants and said those lobbyists, some former HUD officials andother prominent Republicans with little or no experience in housing,appeared to win special treatment from HUD officials.   At an August hearing, HUD Inspector General Paul A. Adams saidhis investigators had discovered additional payments that broughtknown consultant fees to $5.7 million, and in a report sent to theSenate panel this week Adams said the total had grown to $6 million.   Kitchin, southeastern regional director for the Reagan and Bushpresidential campaigns, received $90,000 more than had been knownjust last month, bringing his total from $25,000 to $115,000, thereport said.   The first $25,000 was for his work on a North Carolina projectPierce approved over the objection of several agency experts.   And auditors uncovered an additional $800 paid to Frederick Bush,who is no relation to the president but served as a top aide tothen-Vice President Bush and as well as treasurer of hispresidential campaign.   Frederick Bush was in line to be U.S. ambassador to Luxembourgbut withdrew him name from consideration earlier this month after itbecame clear his work as a HUD consultant had doomed his chances ofSenate confirmation.   The new report also put a price tag on the effect of the 1983decision to abandon a ``fair share'' financing formula, whichdistributed Moderate Rehabilitation funds to based on local housingneeds and ability to administer the program. Instead, spendingdecisions became discretionary and were made at HUD headquarters, achange auditors have concluded opened the door for influencepeddling.   Of $3.1 billion spent on the program from October 1983 throughSeptember 1988, about 40 percent, or $1.2 billion, was``misallocated when compared to the fair share percentages,'' thereport said.</TEXT></DOC>
