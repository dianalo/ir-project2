SHEERAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CLEVELAND (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The feuding family of brain-damagedsinger-composer Barry Sadler has agreed to allow a judge to name anindependent guardian to handle his affairs, another judge saidTuesday evening.   Cuyahoga County Probate Judge John J. Donnelly said Sadler'sfamily ``has gotten together'' and agreed to let Probate Court JudgeJames Everett, in Nashville, Tenn., name an independent guardian.   Under the agreement, the guardian must consult with familymembers before making major decisions for Sadler, said Donnelly, whosaid relatives indicated a preference for naming as guardian aVietnam veteran like Sadler.   Sadler's mother, Bebe, and son, Thor, 24, had made competingappeals to be named guardian for Sadler, who was interviewed Mondaynight by Donnelly at Southwest General Hospital in suburbanMiddleburg Heights.   ``The responses were confusing,'' said Donnelly. Sadlerrepeatedly referred to this year as 1980 even after being told thecorrect date, the judge said.   Sadler, 48, could name only two of his three children, Donnellysaid.   Sadler is best known for his ``Ballad of the Green Berets,''which was a hit in 1965. He reportedly lost 30 percent of his brainwhen he was wounded by gunfire last fall in Guatamala City, where hehad lived for five years.   The nature of the attack has never been disclosed.   A psychiatrist and psychologist, both of whom interviewed Sadlerat the hospital, testified Tuesday at the guardianship hearing andwere split on whether he was mentally competent.   Gintautas Z. Sabataitis, a psychologist from Parma Heights, saidSadler was competent but ``severely limited'' in his abilities andneeded a guardian to look after his affairs.   Joel S. Steinberg, a Lyndhurst psychiatrist, said he had notdetermined whether Sadler was competent.   ``I didn't reach a conclusion about that,'' he said. ``I had toleave it in the air.''   Steinberg said Sadler had suffered ``profound neurological loss''but said he was surprised by Sadler's capacities.   Sadler's mother, who moved to Cleveland from Denver to be closeto her son, filed for guardianship after Thor Sadler was appointedguardian for his father by a judge in Nashville.   Sadler was treated there for two months before coming to theCleveland Veterans Administration hospital Nov. 8.</TEXT></DOC>
