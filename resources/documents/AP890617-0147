Boesky's status as chief government informant got another bigboost this past week when a Manhattan federal grand jury charged hisone-time friend and fellow speculator, John Mulheren, in a 42-countindictment alleging securities fraud, mail fraud, conspiracy andphony record-keeping.   The indictment represented another notch on the gun for theManhattan U.S. attorney's office, which has used Boesky'sconfessions as the basis for what has become the biggest fraudscandal in Wall Street history.   For Mulheren, the indictment capped months of speculation that hehad been implicated in serious wrongdoing by Boesky, who has beenserving a three-year term at a minimum-security federal prison inCalifornia since March 1988.   Before Boesky was incarcerated, police had arrested Mulheren forthreatening to kill Boesky with an assault rifle. Associates ofMulheren said at the time he was depressed and angered that hisone-time colleague in the stock speculation business was squealingin exchange for lenient treatment.   A day after the Mulheren indictment, another victim of Boesky'stook a dramatically different approach to the future. MichaelMilken, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.'s pioneering purveyor ofhigh-yield, low-grade securities known as junk bonds, quit the firmand formed his own.   That move finally severed one of the best-known financialrelationships of the decade. Milken, one of the world's wealthiestfinanciers, is considered responsible for Drexel's enormous successin junk bonds.   The Milken-Drexel marriage first began to deteriorate late lastyear when Drexel chose to settle federal securities fraud chargesspawned by Boesky's confessions, while Milken vowed to fight them.   Many Drexel employees and clients thought the firm had turned itsback on Milken, though he remained diplomatically silent on thesubject.   When a federal grand jury indicted Milken in March on 98 countsof securities fraud, tax fraud and racketeering, he took a leave ofabsence from Drexel and speculation intensified he would quit.   What remains unclear now is whether his new company,International Capital Access Group, will draw clients and talentaway from his ex-employer. Milken said the company will offerconsulting to businesses that want to raise money. Equally unclearis whether Milken's company will survive. He faces $1.85 billion inforfeitures of alleged illegal profits and a lengthy prison term ifconvicted in what is the largest federal securities crimeprosecution to date.
