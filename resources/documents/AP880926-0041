Finkelstein, a 64-year-old journalist, last saw his son inDecember 1965 shortly before he sought political asylum during avisit to Britain with a group of writers.   He said his protracted campaign to bring his son to Britain cameto nothing until the intervention of the British government lastyear, when Foreign Secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe presented to Sovietauthorities a list of some 20 Soviets seeking to emigrate toBritain, most to be reunited with family members.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher discussed the plight of thosepeople with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev when he stopped inBritain Dec. 7 on his way to a Washington summit with PresidentReagan. The Foreign Office says many have since emigrated, but hasdeclied to give a figure.   Finkelstein has worked for the British Broadcasting Corp.'sRussian Service since 1980. Shustov, an industrial chemist, said helistened to his father's weekly broadcasts in the Soviet Union.   Because he had applied to emigrate, Shustov said he was barredfrom working as a chemist and forced to take jobs as parking-lotattendant and shopkeeper _ ``such work where there would be no riskof getting any classified information.''   ``Maybe now I will work as an industrial chemist again,'' hesaid.   Finkelstein said he was ``still a little at sea'' over meetinghis son again.   ``I can't yet form an opinion but the omens are good,'' he said.``I have good signs which I haven't had for years in my life _ gooddreams, good happenings and good tidings altogether. I think itwill be alright.''   Finkelstein said he was committed to a labor camp in Moscowbetween 1947 and 1953 for ``using the wrong words'' and his sonused to visit him there.   ``I remember him sitting on my knee and saying to me, `Dad,let's go home.'''</TEXT></DOC>
