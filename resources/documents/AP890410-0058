The group, Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility,urged key members of Congress to focus ``particularly closescrutiny'' on the NSA's role in helping to implement legislationaimed at safeguarding sensitive but unclassified information infederal computers.   ``There is a constant risk that federal agencies, under theguise of enhancing computer security, may find their programs _ tothe extent that they rely upon computer systems _ increasinglyunder the supervision of the largest and most secretiveintelligence organization in the country,'' it said.   In a letter sent to Capitol Hill, the group said that ``theclandestine nature of the NSA, its classified budget, thedifficulty in overseeing its activities, and its aggressive use ofadvanced technologies for eavesdropping and encryption anddecryption of communications, raise serious concerns about itsrole'' in implementing the Computer Security Act.   Computer Professionals for Social Responsibility, based in PaloAlto, Calif., describes itself as an organization of computerscientists and other professionals concerned about the impact ofcomputer technology on society.   The letter, signed by Marc Rotenberg, head of the group'sWashington office, was sent to Reps. Dan Glickman, D-Kan.; DougWalgren, D-Pa., and Tim Valentine, D-N.C.   Glickman, a member of the House Intelligence Committee, was oneof the authors of the Computer Security Act. Walgren and Valentineare chairmen of House Science subcommittees overseeingcomputer-related issues.   Commenting on the letter, Glickman said:   ``I think there is some legitimate concern about the role of NSAin computer security issues. ... We need to make certain that theydon't assert power over civilian (computer) records in thiscountry.''   Cynthia Beck, a spokeswoman at the NSA's public affairs office,declined to comment on the letter.   The NSA, headquartered at Fort Meade, Md., about halfway betweenWashington and Baltimore, has a work force topping 60,000 employees_ more than all other U.S. spy agencies combined _ and a budgetsaid to be upwards of $10 billion a year.   Its main missions are eavesdropping on communications around theworld, encrypting U.S. communications and cracking foreign codes,as well as protecting the security of U.S. military computers andcommunications systems.   Last month, the NSA reached an agreement with the NationalInstitute of Standards and Technology, a research arm of theCommerce Department based in suburban Gaithersburg, Md.   The memorandum of understanding was aimed at facilitating aprogram under which the two agencies have started jointly reviewingthousands of computer security plans submitted by officesthroughout the government.   In its letter, the computer professionals group noted thatinstitute lacks the resources to fully implement the computersecurity legislation and thus must rely on the NSA for assistance.   ``This may be a marriage of convenience, but it is not amarriage between equals,'' it said. ``NSA's resources for thisparticular project are, by best estimates, at least 10 timesgreater in manpower and budget than those'' of the institute.   The letter contended that ``Congress must monitor the actions ofthe NSA particularly closely. Under the Computer Security Act, theNSA will have access to information about computer systemsthroughout the entire federal government.''   ``This is an extraordinary amount of information and literallyprovides a blueprint for the management of all federal computersystems,'' it said.</TEXT></DOC>
