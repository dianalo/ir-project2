Well, a large part ofthe answer is a licensing deal the company negotiated with Far Sidecartoonist Gary Larson, who contributed a year's worth of zany line drawingsand random animation events (including a meteor that plunges through thescreen and a flock of penguins on an ice floe).andP;  Amaze says Larson is thesingle best-selling calendar cartoonist in the world; the print versions ofhis Far Side calendars currently sell four million copies a year.andP;  It's hardto translate that kind of cult following into software sales, but our guessis that Amaze's electronic Far Side calendar may top 300,000 copies in thenext six months.andP;  But Amaze's founders aren't just trading on Larson's cultfollowing.andP;  In a broader sense, they've rediscovered the personal computer--amachine that is most interesting and compelling when it embodies a user'sperspective of the world.andP;  Amaze's Far Side calendar isn't just aproductivity tool that organizes data for anonymous robots: Rather,, thecalendar implies that its users are real people who appreciate a touch ofwhimsy and who enjoy embellishing their work environments.andP;  This stuff reallymatters: Witness the proliferation of flying-toaster screen savers andcustomized Windows wallpaper patterns.andP;  Probably one reason for the earlysuccess of the Macintosh was its customizable desktop, the curious beeps andburps that could be substituted for system-level alerts, and the whimsicalicons and messages that constantly remind users that Apple thinks of them (orused to think of them) as something more than biological appendages to amainframe environment.andP;  If there's a lesson here, it isn't that the way tocreate a better spreadsheet is to hire Woody Allen to write the help system.andO;Sometimes &quot;personal&quot; applications are simply software products that areflexible, friendly, and engaging.andP;  In a sense, all software reveals somethingabout the personality and values of its developers.andP;  Amaze is clearly acompany run by enthusiastic, fresh-thinking people (tongue in cheek, GaryLarson says he decided to work with the company because its founders &quot;seemedto have an uncanny resemblance to some of the characters I draw&quot;)--and it'sno accident that their software mirrors those qualities.andP;  The Far SideComputer Calendar, $69.95; Amaze Inc., 11810 115th Ave. NE, Kirkland, Wash.andO;98034; 206/820-7007.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
