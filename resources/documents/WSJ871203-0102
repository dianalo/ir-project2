It explains much, the Cuban-born prelate said, &quot;to think that a person would rather live in a prison in another country than return to his country of birth.&quot; Bishop Roman helped negotiate release of the Oakdale hostages. As of late yesterday, the Atlanta crisis had not been resolved.    Some of the detainees are tough customers who deserve little sympathy, of course. But others are guilty of relatively minor offenses. All are victims of Fidel Castro's cynicism.    Their story began in 1980 when several thousand Cubans mobbed Peru's embassy in Havana seeking political asylum. Castro responded by announcing that for a limited time anyone could leave Cuba from the port at Mariel. Of the more than 125,000 Cubans who set sail, about 2,000 were dangerous criminals and mental patients whom Mr. Castro intentionally folded in among the refugees.    At this point the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) deserves some blame for its handling of the Mariel boatlift. The INS declared that all of the Marielitos were &quot;excludable aliens,&quot; because they were sent to processing camps before an authorized &quot;entry&quot; into the U.S. This is a status in immigration law lower than illegal immigrant.    More than 100,000 were released immediately. An additional 20,000 had committed political crimes or minor offenses in Cuba, and also were released. Of the rest, 1,200 were suspected of having committed real crimes in Cuba and 600 had serious mental problems. Of these, 1,600 were released; 210 remained in detention.    By 1984, however, the 210 had been rejoined by an additional 7,400 of the original Marielitos. The INS says these 7,400 have committed felonies or misdemeanors (such as shoplifting) in the U.S. Immigration law says that &quot;excludable aliens&quot; must return home if they commit a crime. Therefore, going by the book, the INS would ship all these people back to Cuba. (Half of them already have served their full terms.)    These several thousand Cubans remained in the detention centers. Then in 1984, Mr. Castro agreed to take back the detained Marielitos in exchange for the U.S. accepting 3,000 political prisoners and up to 20,000 immigrants a year. This deal sounded too good to be true, and it was. Mr. Castro used his modern slave trade as leverage against the U.S. by announcing in May 1985 that he wouldn't take back any Cubans if Radio Marti was on the air. Radio Marti, the Voice of America station that broadcasts into Cuba, reports the bleak facts of life on Mr. Castro's island. The State Department &quot;retaliated&quot; by refusing to allow Cuban political prisoners or emigrants into the U.S. The standoff continued; the detainees sat.    Mr. Castro eventually missed the hard-currency remittances that flow back to Cuba from emigres and concluded he wasn't going to get Radio Marti off the air. Two weeks ago, he agreed to take back the detained Cubans, and the U.S. agreed to accept more immigrants. The announcement of this deal set off the prison riots.    Many of the detained Marielitos deny they committed any crimes; others are in for minor violations, and most had come to believe there was a good chance they could stay once their prison terms were completed. Many now have families in the U.S.    The rioting is merely the most visible sign of continued disorder in U.S. immigration policy. On another front, the Simpson-Mazzoli immigration bill has already led to fines for two employers who couldn't find legal residents to fill jobs. There will surely be more prosecutions and hounding of immigrants in parts of the U.S. suffering from a labor shortage.    Attorney General Meese has agreed to a review of each Marielito detainee's record. This may not go far enough. Mr. Castro can still revive the Marielitos issue as a pretext for preventing political prisoners or other Cubans from leaving. The game of playing with human lives to gain political leverage over the Yanquis comes easily enough to a communist dictator. This nation, however, bears a moral cost when it sends anyone back to a totalitarian regime.    We should deprive Mr. Castro of the means to make the Marielitos little more than barter for his political prisoners who seek our shores. That could be accomplished by giving all but the most dangerous of the Cuban detainees the right to stay. </TEXT></DOC>
