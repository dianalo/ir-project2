In this method sulphuricacid and air are supplied in the oxidation chamber so that after filtrationsaleable gypsum is produced as a final product. Surprisingly, it wasfound out that with a sufficient lowering of the pH value to the stronglyacid range by addition of sulphuric acid in the range of pH less than3, iron-III is reduced to iron-II.</TEXT></DOC>
