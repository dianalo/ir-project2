WIELAARD</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The government said Tuesday it wantsNATO to delay a decision to modernize its short-range nuclear armsuntil the early 1990s and agree to open East-West arms talks aboutthese weapons as soon as possible.   ``By adopting this position, Belgium hopes to contribute to .. .arms control and disarmament,'' Prime Minister Wilfried Martenstold a joint session of Parliament's defense and foreign affairscommittees.   By seeking a delay, Belgium joins West Germany, where the issuehas caused political friction. Chancellor Helmut Kohl said recentlyhe wants any production decision delayed until 1991 or 1992, afterimportant elections in West Germany next year.   The United States and Britain seek an early commitment tomodernization.   Martens defended a delay by pointing to a new climate of detenteand a more moderate leadership in Moscow.   ``The Atlantic alliance nations evidently cannot remaininsensitive to the policy of perestroika and glasnost,'' he said.   Martens said Defense Minister Guy Coeme would present Belgium'sview to a NATO defense ministers meeting in Brussels next week.   He said no decision to upgrade short-range nuclear arms shouldbe taken before 1991-92, adding that ``the government hopesnegotiations on ... (such) arms can begin as soon as possible.''   ``The government will do all it can to achieve that goal. It isdetermined to open an active diplomatic action, both within NATO ... and in bilateral contacts.''   He said Belgium agreed the North Atlantic Treaty Organizationshould ``maintain tactical nuclear arms, where needed, withoutsignificant increases in their ranges.''   Martens' announcement was seen as reflecting a compromise onnuclear arms within his center-left coalition government. TheSocialist partners of Christian Democrat Martens strongly oppose anearly modernization decision.   Martens referred to Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev'sprogram of economic and political reforms which he said were of``historic importance.''   The prime minister said a delay to modernize was entirelyconsistent with NATO efforts to draft a comprehensive overview ofits defense needs over the next decades. This overview, under studysince June 1987, is to be released at a summit meeting of the NATOleaders in Brussels on May 29-30.   Within NATO, America and Britain want quick approval of plans toboost the range of the 700 nuclear-armed Lance missiles from 65 toroughly 250 miles by the mid-1990s.   This is part of a modernization program that also coversartillery shells and replacing free-fall bombs with air-to-groundmissiles.   The new Lances and the air-launched missiles would be deployedas of 1995. The gun shells already have been upgraded or are beingimproved.   The United States and Britain want to move ahead on the newLances now so the U.S. Congress can allocate the required researchand development funds. The two countries oppose negotiations aboutthese weapons.   ``We cannot accept negotiations about short-range nucleararms,'' a U.S. source at NATO said Tuesday, speaking on conditionof anonymity.   ``We think these weapons are necessary to NATO strategy. Thereare the only (nuclear) weapons left in Europe,'' he said, followingU.S.-Soviet accord to remove ground-launched, medium-range nuclearmissiles.   The source said an alliance commitment to the new Lance does notimply a decision to produce the missiles.   ``What we want (from the allies) is a signal so that theCongress can proceed with funds for research and development,'' hesaid, adding that such a signal would go a long way to stiflecongressional complaints that the European NATO allies do not pulltheir weight in NATO.</TEXT></DOC>
