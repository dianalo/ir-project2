Not that prices fell; in fact, most OTC stocks rose a bit. The Nasdaq composite index was up 0.5% to 328.67; and the National Market System industrials, which better reflect the big stocks traded by institutions, were up 0.8% to 130.52, in line with the Dow Jones Industrials. Gainers outpaced losers on the National Market System 10 to 9.    But no signs of last week's buying frenzy were apparent in the market yesterday. Trading was leisurely. Some 108 million shares changed hands on the National Market System, far fewer than during the record-setting days of last week. And the stocks that made big moves yesterday were reacting to news, rather than speculative enthusiasm for depressed stocks at bargain prices.    &quot;Most salesmen have gone away for the holiday,&quot; says Peter Da Puzzo, executive vice president of Shearson Lehman Bros. Traders and the representatives who sell stocks to individuals have had an exhausting few months, dealing with the rigors of the crash and then the sudden sharp reversal and upturn in the OTC market last week. &quot;They've taken a few days to relax,&quot; he says, adding that the slowdown probably will continue through the holiday period.    With many of the top traders, portfolio managers and other decision makers away yesterday, most traders were carrying out maintenance plans laid out last week or filling orders. The big technology stocks, which ordinarily drive up the OTC market on strong days, were slow and mixed yesterday. Apple Computer rose 1 1/4 to 41 3/4; but it had announced that a summary judgment was granted by a district court in California that dismisses claims against it in a securities class action over charges that it failed to disclose material information regarding the Lisa computer in 1982 and 1983.    Among other computer hardware issues, Seagate Technology fell 1/4 to 15 3/4; Intergraph was off 1/2 to 24 3/4; Sun Microsystems fell 3/4 to 31 3/4. Microsoft, the largest software issue, fell 1/2 to 51 1/2; while Lotus was up 3/4 to 30 1/4.    Among the slightly smaller computer issues -- many that soared in the start of the winter rally last week -- Wyse Technology fell 3/8 to 21 5/8; Apollo Computer rose 1/8 to 12 7/8, and Mentor Graphics fell 3/4 to 23.    Individuals continued buying some depressed small issues yesterday, but most were stocks with a story.    Typical of the stocks with the biggest gains, John Adams Life, whose board last week authorized a buy-back of 450,000 of the insurers' 2.9 million shares, rose 1 1/8 to 3 1/8. The stock ended 1986 at 6, had drifted to 4 3/4 before the crash, when it tumbled to 2 1/4.    CMS Advertising, which packages packets of direct-mail postcards and was one of 1986's hottest new issues, yesterday rose 5/8 to 2 3/8. Market-makers had held the stock at 7 1/4 through the crash, but it buckled in November when one of its co-underwriters and market makers, Porcari Fearnow andamp; Associates, ceased doing business.    And Rabbit Software yesterday announced some big management changes, sending its share price up 9/16 to 3. Rabbit had tumbled to 2 3/8 from 4 1/4 in the crash. </TEXT></DOC>
