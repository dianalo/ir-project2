The averagesize of the rabbit dermal irritant patch tests was 1.0, indicating thatMSMA is a mild irritant to intact skin. Relatively little work has beendone on the toxicity of organic arsenicals, especially the herbicidemonosodium methanearsonate (MSMA). The EPA review reported a dermal studycarried out on 6 adult male rabbits. The clipped skin areas of the rabbitswere exposed to doses of MSMA for a 24 hours period. The animals wereobserved for a period of 2 weeks for signs of toxicity following theexposure. The dermal LD{sub 50} value was found to be between 2 and 4g/kg.</TEXT></DOC>
