The Bonneville Power Administrationsponsored the Residential Standaards Demonstration Program (RSDP) in1984 that resulted in the construction of 400 energy efficient singlefamily homes in the four state region. typically these building incorporateddesign features such as high levels of insulation for attic, walls andfloors, triple glazed windows and air tight construction with heat recoveryventilation. These energy efficient buildings have been compared againstanother group of 400 new, but conventional houses in the Northwest todetermine the actual savings of such efficiency standards for space heat.Each house has been monitored for at least one year using a triple meteringsystem that records energy use for space heat, domestic hot water andother appliances as well as average interior and exterior temperatures.In addition, a wealth of further detail is collected on the constructionof the homes, and the heating system and occupancy characteristics. Thethermal performance data are now available. The project has revealedaverage annual space heat savings of 2-4 kWh/square foot of living areawhen comparing the energy efficient homes against others currently built.</TEXT></DOC>
