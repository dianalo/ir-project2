Tonetti also said the industry needs more regulation at allgovernment levels, especially in the area of commercialized wastemanagement facilities.   He spoke to the Independent Petroleum Association of America.The conference in San Antonio lasts through Tuesday.   Oil producers, in some cases, are not using ``common sense''when disposing of exploration and production wastes, allowingnon-hazardous materials to be mixed with toxic chemicals, Tonettisaid.   If not disposed of properly, oil field wastes threaten publichealth and safety because wastes generated during oil explorationand production can wipe out groundwater supplies and contaminatesoil, Tonetti said.   Under the EPA's Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, thosewastes are exempt from hazardous waste regulations.   But the act applies the exemption only to drilling fluids,produced waters and other wastes associated with crude oil ornatural gas production.   The exemption does not include unused chemicals, spent solvents,empty drums, used lubrication oils or acidic cleaners. Thesechemicals sometimes get mixed with non-hazardous wastes and createa hazardous substance and a health risk, Tonetti said.   ``A lot of misunderstanding exists among producers about what isexempt and what is not,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
