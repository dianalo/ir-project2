In fact,some of these sources do not apply in the Mediterranean. And the mostpromising interesting seem to be solar, wind, geothermal and on a smallerscale biomass. The paper gives respectively the technical potential,the exploited level (in the world) and technical status of present andfuture exploitation. The paper concludes on the need of active policiesfor development, for these sources to contribute valuably to future energysupply in the Mediterranean Basin.</TEXT></DOC>
