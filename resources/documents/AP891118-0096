Tim Wirth,D-Colo. ``We have failed.''   Senate leaders spent Friday imploring their colleagues to acceptthe plan passed by the House Thursday _ to push $89,500congressional salaries to at least $120,800 in the next 13{ monthsand then bar members from padding their income with speeches.   ``The House of Representatives demonstrated courage,'' saidSenate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine.   But a majority of senators didn't buy it. Privately, it was saidMitchell was three votes short.   So he and Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas regroupedand pushed through a compromise to increase senators' salaries only$8,900 and gradually, over many years, phase out themuch-criticized honoraria system.   Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., called it a ``safe chicken dance''and predicted a new Senate salary-honoraria fight next year.   Sen. Robert C. Byrd, D-W.Va., said the Senate demonstrated``cowardice'' and made itself an even more elite institution forthe wealthy than it already is. ``We have failed the country, wehave failed the institution and we have failed its future,'' hesaid.   The House, which stayed in session past 1 a.m. Saturday awaitingSenate action, took about 30 seconds to send the bill to thepresident who is expected to sign it. The bill gives Bush'sCabinet-level aides and federal judges the same percentage raisesas the House.   House and Senate leaders waited until only a few days before theplanned adjournment of Congress for the year to push the packagethrough. Compared to a failed attempt at a 51 percent pay hikeearly this year, their strategy gave opponents little time to mounta campaign against it.   But consumer advocate Ralph Nader, a critic of any congressionalsalary boost, said that when the Senate blinked at the Housepackage, it opened the door for opponents to win repeal later.   ``The disparity now between the House and the Senate versionswill further encourage next year a major repeal drive of the entirepackage and will probably affect the next election,'' he predicted.   By careful design, the biggest part of the House pay raise _ 25percent on Jan. 1, 1991 _ is delayed until after next year'selections. That way, members cannot be accused of voting themselvesa whopping pay increase _ at least not one that takes effect beforetheir constituents have a chance to express their displeasure atthe voting booth next fall.   House members seemed comfortable with that delay, and withgetting rid of honoraria. It was James Madison who more than 200years ago suggested that Congress approve pay raises for itselfonly to take effect in the next Congress.   ``Somehow, I just have this visceral feeling we look better thanthe other body,'' said House Minority Leader Bob Michel, R-Ill.``I'd be willing to bet a good deal that they'll be adjusting theirown scenario within a year.''   Seven years ago, in a similar situation, the Senate earned lessthan the House for about six months before passing a catchup raise.   The pay package finished Saturday is quirky and complex, and theSenate will actually earn more than the House in 1990 beforefalling behind in 1991.   For the House, the federal judges and government executives, a4.1 percent raise will take effect as soon as Bush signs adeficit-reduction bill that Congress hopes to send him by Monday.   Then, on Jan. 1, the Senate will take a 9.9 percent raise andthe House and the others a 3.6 percent raise. That would bringSenate salaries to $98,400 and House salaries to $96,600 for 1990.   On Jan. 1, 1991, the House will get a 25 percent raise to$120,800. Both chambers also get whatever government-wide cost ofliving adjustment is given at that time.   The House bans its members from pocketing honoraria checks in1991, but the Senate, which now allows its members to take morethan the House, decided to start now reducing honorariadollar-for-dollar as its salary goes up over the years.   In 1990, House members can keep $26,850 in honoraria, the sameas in 1989. The Senate reduces its limit of $35,800 to $26,568.   For both chambers, the legislation caps other outside earnedincome at 15 percent of salary, and restricts lawmakers from beingpaid members of boards of directors or performing otherprofessional services. Book royalties from legitimate publishersare exempted.   Rules on accepting gifts and free travel from other than familyare tightened.   In addition, lawmakers and Cabinet-level administrationofficials are barred from lobbying in their old branches ofgovernment for a year after leaving office. Government employeeswho get special knowledge from working on treaties or tradeagreements are barred from turning around and hiring out to privateinterests who need that knowledge.   However, in a compromise with the Bush administration, the billalso softens recently-enacted laws on government procurement thatthe administration contends are too burdensome.</TEXT></DOC>
