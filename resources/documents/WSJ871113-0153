A new twist this year is the stock market's recent decline, which opens the door for a normally unwise tax strategy -- accelerating gains from other investments into the current year. This maneuver would at least put stock-related losses to good use and could ultimately reduce taxes.    Although tax rates for 1987 are lower than they were last year, the decline won't be enough to offset the elimination or scaling back of some important deductions. Some, such as the write-off for sales taxes, are gone entirely, while many others that are being phased out over several years, including the deduction for consumer interest, begin fading away with 1987 returns.    That will mean tax increases for a lot of people. William G. Brennan, publisher of Brennan Reports newsletter, echoes a by-now familiar lament when he says, &quot;Most of my clients' tax liabilities for 1987 and 1988 will be equal to -- if not higher than -- (what) they would have been without tax reform.&quot;    Individuals who move quickly may still be able to ease the blow with some traditional year-end tactics -- timing capital gains and losses, deferring income and accelerating deductions. But the Tax Reform Act of 1986 has made it essential for taxpayers to look before they leap.    With the loss of so many deductions, for example, it will be tempting to give appreciated property to charity and round up other remaining write-offs before Dec. 31. But those moves could trigger the expanded alternative minimum tax, which no longer affects just the wealthy.    &quot;It's going to sneak up and grab a lot of people,&quot; says Tom Ochsenschlager, a tax partner in the Washington office of the Grant Thornton accounting firm.    This year there are five marginal tax rates, or the highest rates at which the last dollar of income is taxed, starting at 11% and rising to 38.5% in an orderly manner. Beginning next year there will be only two marginal rates -- 15% and 28% -- but &quot;that top bracket has some wrinkles to it,&quot; says Rick Wolfe, a tax partner at accountants Touche Ross in Los Angeles.    As a result, many people next year will pay 33% on income within certain ranges, as well as on some additional income, depending on how many personal exemptions they have. The thresholds on that 5% surtax will be adjusted annually for inflation.    Here's how it will work in 1988: Married couples filing joint returns will pay 33% on taxable income between $71,900 and $149,250. For single people, the surtax will apply to income between $43,150 and $89,560. Then, for each personal exemption, an additional $10,920 of income beyond the top of those ranges will also be taxed at the 33% rate. After that, the tax rate drops back to 28%.    Getting an early start on the calculations can help taxpayers avoid running afoul of the tax act's stiffer withholding rules. To avoid a penalty, withholding and estimated tax payments through Dec. 31 must at least equal 90% of taxes that will be due next April 15. That's up from 80% under the old tax law. There is an exception for taxpayers whose withholding and estimated tax payments at least equal last year's tax liability.    The new record-keeping requirements provide an extra incentive to compile information now. The Internal Revenue Service wants records tracing four kinds of interest expenses: mortgage -- type borrowing (including home-equity loans), investment, personal and business. Most mortgage interest is fully deductible in 1987; personal or consumer interest is 65% deductible this year, but only 40% deductible in 1988; business interest is generally fully deductible in both years.    Still, with Dec. 31 fast approaching, reducing the 1987 tax bite is apt to be uppermost in the minds of most taxpayers. What follows is a summary of the maneuvers that are likely to be the most helpful -- and some of the things to watch out for in implementing them.    Investors who took short-term gains earlier this year might still be able to ease the tax bite by realizing short-term losses on other investments. For the first time, any losses, whether short-term or long-term, that exceed gains can be used to offset ordinary income dollar-for-dollar, up to a $3,000 limit. Previously, long-term losses were worth only 50 cents on the dollar.    Stock investors who have recognized more than $3,000 of losses might want to &quot;look at their portfolios to see if this is the year to recognize gains they might otherwise put off,&quot; says Jeffrey Cole, a tax attorney at the New York law firm of Baer Marks andamp; Upham. Such gains might come from selling an old tax shelter, for example, or disposing of an installment-sale note on real estate. Taking these gains now rather than later could save taxes in the long run.    In some cases, however, it may be beneficial to carry forward stock losses from this year into next if an investor will be in the top tax bracket next year and anticipates capital gains. As a rule, investors who expect to be in the 33% bracket in 1988 and already have long-term capital gains might want to go ahead and take them this year. Such profits are currently taxed at a flat 28% rate, but after this year they will be taxed as ordinary income.    Just the opposite strategy would work best for short-term gains on investments held less than six months. Those gains are already taxed as ordinary income. So, a deferral could save an investor in the top tax bracket both years 5.5 percentage points in taxes -- the difference between having those profits taxed at 38.5% in 1987 and 33% in 1988.    A municipal bond &quot;swap&quot; can also save taxes. Such a swap involves selling old bonds, to nail down either gains or losses on those issues this year, and buying new ones with similar credit ratings, coupon rates and maturities. While the strategy also works with corporate bonds, it is more difficult to swap taxable bonds with the same terms.    Even this late in 1987, it may still be possible to defer some income so that it will be taxed at a lower rate next year. Payment of a year-end bonus, for example, might be delayed until 1988; buying Treasury securities would produce interest that isn't taxed until maturity. Just how much tax savings such moves would produce will vary from individual to individual.    But if deferring income until next year is a good idea, trying to postpone it until 1989 and beyond is chancy, particularly for executives who normally defer large amounts of salary. Congress is already talking of a tax increase in 1988 to help cover the federal budget deficits.    &quot;A lot of people believe rates will never be lower&quot; than 28%, says Peter Baumler, a compensation specialist in the Milwaukee office of the Arthur Andersen andamp; Co. accounting firm.    It will be wiser than ever to accumulate planned medical expenses this year since the deductibility threshold for 1987 increased to 7.5% of adjusted gross income and tax rates will decline next year.    Prepaying several years of regular contributions to charity in 1987 is as valid as it was last year, when tax rates first dropped. Except for taxpayers who may be subject to the alternative minimum tax, gifts of appreciated property, which are deductible at full market value and don't incur capital gains tax, will be worth more than deductions for cash.    The IRS, however, will frown on prepaying miscellaneous expenses, such as subscriptions to periodicals or fees for general financial and tax advice. Those expenses must now exceed 2% of adjusted gross income to be deductible.    Individuals who regularly use a professional investment counselor but don't have 2% in miscellaneous expenses might still be able to deduct some advisory fees. &quot;Asking an adviser to evaluate specific investments should qualify as an investment expense,&quot; says Mr. Brennan, the newsletter publisher.    A vacation home rented out part time may now produce more deductions if it qualifies as a second home, rather than as rental property. Individuals who haven't yet used a ski condo or beach house the greater of 14 days or 10% of the time it has been rented this year might want to schedule in a few more days before Dec. 31. That way, mortgage interest will be fully deductible.    While high-income individuals with heavy tax-shelter losses and lots of deductions have always had to worry about the alternative minimum tax, this year it will ensnare many people earning as little as $50,000.    The minimum tax essentially establishes a floor on the amount of tax that must be paid. The rate is a flat 21% but it applies to more income than the usual method because certain deductions can't be used. This year, for example, taxpayers subject to the minimum tax can't deduct losses from real estate or businesses where they aren't actively involved in management. The regular method still allows taxpayers to use 65% of such losses from investments made before Oct. 23, 1986, to offset salary income and dividends.    Other regular deductions also can't be used in calculating minimum tax liabilities. Two additions that can't be used for 19: the appreciation on property given to charity and the so-called bargain element of incentive-stock options -- the difference between the option's price and the stock's market value when the option is exercised.    To gauge the minimum-tax threat, individuals should figure their taxes the regular way and with the special minimum-tax rules; they pay the higher tab. Deciding which deductions to accelerate into this year without triggering the minimum tax calls for making those dual projections for at least 1987 and 1988, and preferably even further out.    ---   Ms. Bettner, based in Los Angeles, writes frequently on personal finance and investing for The Wall Street Journal.    ---                   Estimating Your Taxes   The following work sheet will help you quickly estimateyour 1987 tax liability; many tax situations will requireadditional calculations.
