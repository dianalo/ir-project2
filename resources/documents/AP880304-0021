The 16 NATO leaders on Thursday wound up their two-day summit,the first in six years, in a show of solidarity that glossed overdifferences on arms issues and applauded superpower efforts toreduce long-range nuclear weapons.   President Reagan claimed a mandate for his planned spring summitin Moscow and said NATO was ``ready to get down to business'' onstrategic arms talks.   He said the medium-range nuclear weapons treaty signed by theUnited States and the Soviet Union last December was ``a directresult'' of alliance unity.   The alliance, troubled by a dispute over the modernization ofshort-range nuclear missiles in West Germany, sidestepped a directconfrontation on that issue and produced an upbeat proclamation ofunity.   The leaders pledged to maintain a nuclear presence in Europe todeter a Soviet attack, and called for a reduction in Soviet blocconventional forces. The West says the Soviet bloc has asubstantial edge in five major ground categories.   NATO said ``the search for improved and more stable relationswith the Soviet Union and the other countries of Eastern Europe isamong our principal concerns'' and called for efforts to reduceEast-West tensions.   The statement noted ``encouraging signs of change'' in thepolicies of the Soviet Union'' that create ``the prospect forgreater openness in their relations with their own people and withother nations.''   ``But we look beyond pronouncements for tangible and lastingpolicy changes addressing directly the issues dividing East andWest,'' the communique said.   ``We agree that the speedy and complete withdrawal of Soviettroops from Afghanistan and effective restoration of that country'ssovereignty would be of major significance. It is against thesecriteria that we shall assess General Secretary Gorbachev's recentstatements,'' the statement said.   The NATO leaders were united in their assessment of the allianceand its goals.   ``We're strong, we're united, we're prosperous and we're free,''said Reagan.   Underscoring NATO's commitment to keep nuclear weapons inEurope, he said, ``All of us understand the absolute necessity ofmaintaining the credibility of our deterrent.''   ``There is no doubt whatsoever that the agenda we have set nowis the right one for NATO,'' said British Prime Minister MargaretThatcher.   French President Francois Mitterand said ``this is one more steptoward disarmament, with all the necessary precautions.''   The harmony of the meeting had been threatened by West Germany'sreluctance to replace older short-range nuclear weapons with newer,more effective ones.   Most of these weapons, if fired, would hit German soil, East orWest, and the modernization campaign has inflamed disarmamentpassions in West Germany.   In a compromise, the communique avoided use of the wordmodernization, to which West Germany objects. Instead, the documentsaid NATO will maintain ``an appropriate mix of adequate andeffective nuclear and conventional forces which will continue to bekept up to date where necessary.''   NATO Secretary General Lord Carrington said the wordmodernization _ perhaps because of translation problems _ ``meansin the minds of a number of people in different countries in Europethe introduction of new and more terrible and more destructiveweapons.''   However, he said it was more likely that the new weapons wouldbe ``more accurate and may very well be of less destructive power.''</TEXT></DOC>
