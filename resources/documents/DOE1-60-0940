Theevolution of the present agricultural structure and resource utilizationpatterns are analysed in terms of past economic, political and technicalconditions. This framework provides the underpinnings to examine whataspects of the western Canadian food system are of variance with thegoals of the conserver society. As fossil fuel related inputs becomerelatively more expensive then renewable energy substitutes, farmerswill expand the usage of the less costly alternatives. Some of theseadjustments will involve a reduction in tillage operations, expandeduse of herbicides, inclusion of forage and cropping rotations, expansionof livestock production, and utilization of their waste products forfertilizer and energy inputs. These and similar changes can largely beaccomplished through the price system. Government can hasten the adjustmentthrough providing rural communities with more information on conservationalternatives and tax incentives. Another menues of adjustments associatedwith agricultural use of land, water and air can only be achieved withincreased government involvement. Some of these include the preservationof farm land, erosion control, reduction of livestock odors, improvedwater quality and water development (drainage and irrigation). A seriesof policy options are reviewed in terms of their effectiveness and comparativecosts of meeting the goals of a conserver society. 2 refs., 1 fig., 6tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
