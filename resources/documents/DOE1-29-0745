A method used to determine the value of conventionaltechnologies is described; three years of performance data for the world'slargest PV plant (Carrisa Plains, California) are presented; and thedata are combined with the valuing method to determine the PV plant'svalue. Results show that the Carrisa Plains PV plant had comparable outputpatterns during 1984, 1985, and 1986. In particular, the plant's outputwas consistently a good match to PGandE's peak loads thus giving theplant a high value.</TEXT></DOC>
