 According to Dave Ferrise, silicon Graphics' managerof IS technical support, the insufficient disk space of the system'sinformation arteries was costing the company millions.andM;According to Ferrise, restricted disk I/O was the culprit that forcedtechnicians to close access to the system for as many as five days each monthso they could chum out vital end of-month reports.andP;  The closure and delaycaused by the end-of-month reports frequently forced managers to makecritical manufacturing decisions without up-to-the-minute information onbacklogs and inventories, often resulting in costly planning mistakes.andM;Two HSC70 controllers connected the clustered VAX 8530, 8550 and 6420 to 10DEC RA-series drives, providing a total capacity of 5.55GB.andP;  Using a DECdiagnostic package called VAX Performance Advisor, Ferrise conducted anexhaustive survey of I/O traffic between the system's four 456MB RA81s andsix 622MB RA82s.andP;  The survey pinpointed three main data types, each of whichcalled for a different storage solution.andM;First, Ferrise concluded that he needed two 500MB to 600MB disk drives tohold a few &quot;very hot files,&quot; consisting of several high-contention RMSdatabase files that contained sales analysis, general ledger and order-entryinformation.andP;  Second, he ascertained that two 1.7GB disks were needed tostore test database files, which were voluminous but considered &quot;lowcontention&quot;--users rarely needed to access them.andP;  Finally, Ferrise selected asolid-state disk to store a few smaller, high-contention RMS files containingpurchase-order transactions.andM;He contacted about five storage vendors, including DEC.andP;  He decided onthird-party storage provider System industries (SI) of Milpitas, Calif.,andO;primarily because it was able to offer the variety of disk products heneeded.andM;Besides two 1.7GB SMD drives, two 5-1/4-inch 566MB ESDI drives and 96MB ofsolid-state disk storage, Ferrise purchased four 900MB SMD drives and four600MB SMD drives from SI to expand capacity for general-purpose data storage.andO;The total purchase ran about $200,000, according to Ferrise.andM;Although DEC's list prices for disk subsystems were substantially higher thanthose of the third parties, cost turned out to be a minor factor in the finaldecision to buy from an independent vendor, he said.andM;&quot;DEC will really move on the price when they're in competition,&quot; Ferrisesaid.andM;Although SI offered a slight price advantage even after heavy discountingfrom DEC, the major motivating factor in choosing SI was the company'ssuperior breadth of product line, Ferrise said.andM;&quot;DEC did not have the product line--it only had a couple of disks that metour needs,&quot; Ferrise said.andP;  &quot;SI gave us the price and the product that wefound was the best.&quot;andM;In addition to SI's variety of disk drives, the company was able to offer asolid-state disk product unavailable in DEC's product arsenal, as well as acompetitive service and support program.andM;During the bidding process, the DEC sales representative who called onFerrise told him that DEC technicians would not service the third-partydrives, a claim that later turned out to be false, Ferrise said.andM;&quot;A lot of DEC sales reps will try to blow that one by you,&quot; he said.andM;Silicon Graphics opted for SI's service package, not only because it was lessexpensive than DEC's comparable service program, but because Ferrise felt SIwould offer faster turnaround for parts replacement.andP;  Ferrise said he hasfound the SI drives to be only half as reliable as his original RA-seriesdrives, but SI technicians have acted promptly to replace defective boardsand firmware.andM;Oddly, performance was never considered an issue in Ferrise's evaluation ofthe various ESDI, SMD and RA drives.andP;  Because the HSC70's data channel cardlimits throughput to only 22MHz, all the drives offered roughly equivalentI/O performance, Ferrise said.andM;&quot;There were no appreciable performance differences,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;[With theHSC,] it's the data path that limits you, not the drive itself.&quot;andM;For an outlay of about $175,000 for the 12 SI Winchester disk drives, thecompany expects to reap rewards amounting to as much as $5 million per year,Ferrise said.andM;Using the additional disk capacity to set aside a &quot;snapshot&quot; copy of thecompany's fiscal data at the end of each month, the information systemsdepartment no longer needs to limit access to the system on the days itgenerates end-of-month reports and zero accounts for the new month, Ferrisesaid.andP;  So, instead of closing the system for four to five days each month,the system is closed for just one day, Ferrise said.andM;&quot;If you were to ask executives here what the greatest thing IS has given themin the past five years, they would say, 'You gave us one-day close [thatamounts to] four or five days of extra visibility into what we were doing,'&quot;Ferrise said.andM;MILES AND MILES OF STORAGEandM;At Lufkin Industries in Lufkin, Texas, a different solution was needed forthe company's disk I/O problems.andM;Lufkin designs and manufactures heavy equipment, such as largepower-transmission gear boxes for ships, refineries and steel mills.andM;The company's lifeblood is its team of 30 designers, draftsmen and engineersthat produces the blueprints for the custom machinery.andP;  The group uses a CADpackage from Schlumberger Technologies that runs redundantly on a MicroVAX3400 and a VAXserver 3800.andP;  The two-host cluster is connected to 31VAXstations over thin-wire Ethernet.andM;Because of the importance of keeping the design group up and running, LouisLloyd, Lufkin's CAD system manager, chose DSSI instead of third-party SCSIperipherals and controllers &quot;to get as close to fault-tolerant as possible.&quot;andM;Although Lloyd might have saved money by choosing SCSI and affording himselfaccess to the proliferation of low-priced SCSI peripherals, he found thatonly DEC's DSSI provided the failure protection he required.andP;  With DSSI, anynode on the network has access to any drive, regardless of which host thedrives are connected to physically.andM;Unlike a DSSI-based system, DEC's SCSI implementation limits access to aparticular disk drive in the event that the drive's primary host fails,according to Lloyd.andP;  The resulting loss of access to critical data would haveconstituted a significant breach in Lloyd's plans for a fault-tolerantsystem.andM;When Lloyd decided that he needed to enlarge the department's disk storagespace, he approached DEC and San Jose, Calif.'s Exsys, the only other companyselling DSSI subsystems.andP;  He decided to buy from both.andM;&quot;We weren't absolutely sure we'd get trouble-free performance out of theExsys tower, so we hedged our bets with DEC drives,&quot; he said.andM;Each host was equipped with two internal DEC RF71 drives.andP;  In addition, Lloydbought a free-standing Exsys system with four 1.2GB SCSI drives.andP;  Althoughone Exsys controller supports as many as seven SCSI disks, Lloyd chose a moreconservative, fault-tolerant approach and followed DEC's precedent ofassigning one controller to each drive.andP;  The Exsys controller attaches toeach drive, performing a SCSI-to-DSSI translation.andM;The reason for choosing the third-party DSSI subsystem was&quot;price/performance, pure and simple.andP;  We got twice the capacity at half theprice,&quot; Lloyd said.andP;  When Lloyd bought the Exsys system in January, DECoffered only four 400MB RF71s in an enclosure.andP;  Lloyd recalls that the driveswere each about $16,000.andP;  Lufkin would have needed 12 RF71s, at an estimatedcost of $192,000, just to equal the capacity of one Exsys system, which costonly about $48,000, he said.andM;Aside from price/performance, Lloyd's biggest concern was whether the servicefor the unit would be as good or better than DEC's maintenance program.andM;&quot;Every day [the system] is down, we lose 31 man-days' worth of production.andO;Even if DEC makes a one-day turnaround on a busted server, we're in deepyogurt,&quot; Lloyd said.andM;Lloyd said his faith in the technical support offered by third parties hasbeen rewarded, and that may lead him to purchase from a third-party vendor inthe future.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
