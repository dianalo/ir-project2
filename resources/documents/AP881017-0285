(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Corning Glass Works more than doubled itsnet income in the third quarter to a record $123.9 million from $50million during the same period last year, the company said Monday.   Corning Chairman James Houghton said ``the excellent resultscame from equity companies as well as strength across the board invirtually all Corning businesses, where the rate of profitabilitywas the best we've seen for a third quarter in the last decade.''   Even without one-time gains of $59 million stemming fromtransactions in Japan, the third-quarter results were a companyrecord.   On a per-share basis, Corning returned $2.74 compared to $1.08 ayear ago. Sales for quarter totaled $625.4 million, up 2.5 percentfrom $610.1 million in the same period a year ago. The company saidthe figure was up 11 percent if adjusted for the disposition of theelectronics business in 1987.   For the 40 weeks ended Oct. 9, the company reported net incomeof $243 million, up from $148.5 million, and sales of $1.58billion, up from $1.54 billion.   Charles Ryan, analyst for Merrill Lynch in New York, saidCorning's restructuring efforts during the past few years have paidoff. The glass maker based in upstate New York has focused itsresearch and development in four main areas _ fiber optics andtelecommunications; medical diagnostic services; ceramics andspecialty glasses; and household products.   Optical fiber sales were modestly improved, according to StephenAlbertalli, a Corning vice president.   ``We projected a flat year in the volatile fiber opticsmarket,'' Albertalli said. ``We're doing a little better than weexpected.''   The company's clinical testing service subsidiary, MedPath,Inc., expanded exports to Latin American and Asia and was part ofthe reason for a 31 percent increase in income from equitycompanies.   A new manufacturing facility being built by Corning and AsahiGlass in Osooka, Japan is expected to expand Corning's presence inthe world market for specialty glass. The plant, which is due toopen in 1989, will manufacture glass used in the display modules ofportable computers and other electronic devices.   The companies household products unit, which manufacturesCorning Glassware, also showed strong sales gains.</TEXT></DOC>
