Based on polls asking how much money people need to avoidpoverty, the groups concluded in a report that 45 million peopleactually live in poverty in the United States _ more than the 32million that fall beneath the federal poverty line.   The report was based on four Gallup Polls of 3,511 peoplebetween July and October of last year. It was released by theCenter on Budget and Policy Priorities, which studies policiesaffecting the poor; and the Families USA Foundation, an advocacygroup for the elderly.   Their report concluded that the nation's poor are more likely tobe white, older and better educated than it would appear using thefederal government's more conservative definition of poverty.   It said there are 53 percent more poor whites, 88 percent moreelderly and 48 percent more higher educated people living inpoverty than government figures show.   ``The government poverty line is based on an arbitrary, arcaneand outdated formula intended to serve the needs of bureaucrats andpoliticians,'' said Ron Pollack, executive director of Families USA.   The groups said their polls asked how much weekly income eachrespondent would set as a poverty line for a family of four. Theaverage income given by respondents was $15,017. The government'sofficial poverty line for a family of four, including two children,is $12,092, based on 1988 figures, the groups said. There is aseparate lower poverty line for the elderly.   The report said 13 percent of Americans are said to be poor bythe government's figures, but 18 percent are poor by the report'sfigures.</TEXT></DOC>
