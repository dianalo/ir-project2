(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Archeologistshope to begin digging this spring for equipment discarded bysoldiers of the Seventh Cavalry as they retreated after the June 25,1876, defeat at Little Bighorn.   Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer and about 215 men were wiped outby Sioux and Cheyenne. Six companies under Maj. Marcus Reno andCapt. Frederick Benteen dug in a few miles away on bluffs above theLittle Bighorn River. Much of what is known about Custer's last daycomes from survivors under Reno and Benteen.   The National Park Service wants to survey a site that wasidentified as the place where, according to historic accounts, Renoand Benteen's men destroyed everything they couldn't carry away orrepair after the two-day siege ended.   There probably won't be any startling revelations about thebattle, but the dump could serve as a time capsule of military gearin use on the Plains during the era, said Doug Scott of the MidwestArcheological Center at Lincoln, Neb.   Scott, a leader of 1984 and 1985 surveys that identified thesite, said he will be looking for pieces of saddles and tack, andnails from ammunition and ration boxes that could support accountsof soldiers using the boxes as fuel.   Horse gear could show what saddles the ies don't threatenresidents' health, said Don Bayly, assistant chief of the cityBio-Environmental Services Division. ``It's just a nuisance, not ahealth matter or violation.''</TEXT><NOTE>Soviets Hire Houston Firm to Market Space Services</NOTE><DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A company whose president wants to launch the U.S.space station into orbit on a Soviet rocket booster has signed acontract to promote Soviet space science services, data and hardware.   Space Commerce Corp. will handle public relations, market Sovietsatellites _ including a new satellite-borne nuclear reactor _ andprovide engineering and technical services, said company presidentArthur M. Dula. He signed a contract with Glavcosmos, the civilianSoviet space agency, Dec. 19 in New York, and it became officialJan. 4 when Alexander E. Dunayev, head of Glavcosmos, signed it inMoscow. Terms were not disclosed.   ``The Soviet Union is going to have a commercial space program,there is no question about that,'' Dula said. ``The only question iswhether an American company is going to work with them to make itreal.''   Dula wants to launch America's space station, Freedom, now in itsdesign and development stage, on the giant Soviet rocket Energia,the world's mightiest rocket, sometime in the 1990s.   ``It would save the American taxpayers about $5 billion,'' hesaid.   U.S. observers have said it might take as many as 18 shuttlemissions, just in the first phase, to put Freedom into space. TheEnergia could put the space station in orbit with two launches.   Space Commerce Corp. is a privately-held Texas corporation withabout 40 shareholders formed in January 1987.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Jan. 26</NOTE></DOC>
