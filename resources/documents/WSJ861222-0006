Terms weren't disclosed.    The engineering, construction and raw materials concern said the three divisions will be sold to an investor group headed by their current management and Citicorp Venture Capital Ltd., a unit of Citicorp, New York.    Only one of the three businesses is unprofitable, but each failed to meet growth and profitablity goals. Thomas F. Faught, president and chief executive officer, called the transaction a step in concentrating Dravo's resources on businesses &quot;which afford greater potential return.&quot;    The combined businesses accounted for $235 million of Dravo's $893 million in revenue in 1985.    Dravo said the intended sale fits its long-term strategy of shedding mature businesses and refocusing the company on markets in which it has a proprietary or technological advantage. Among the units that Dravo has sought to expand, either through acquisition or internal growth, are its municipal waste-to-energy, cogeneration and factory automation businesses, a spokesman said.    Disposition of the three divisions would follow earlier moves by Dravo out of the marine construction and industrial heating equipment businesses.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Dravo closed at $18.75, up 75 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
