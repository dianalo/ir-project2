<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-03-0223 </DOCNO><TEXT>Pulse radiolysis of all-trans diphenyl-substituted polyenes, such as 1,4-diphenylbuta-1,3-diene,1,6-diphenylhexa-1,3,5-triene and 1,8-diphenyl-octa-1,3,5,7-tetraene,in 1,2-dichloroethane solution has been undertaken in the absence andpresence of Bu/sub 4/NPF/sub 6/. The absorption maxima of the diphenylpolyeneradical cations are shifted to shorter wavelengths in the presence ofthe salt. This is evidence for the formation of the contact ion pairsbetween the radical cations and PF/sub 6//sup -/. The decays of the radicalcations, which are due to neutralization reactions with Cl/sup -/, areretarded by the addition of the salt. The rate constants for the neutralizationreactions have been determined for the free-ion and ion-paired states.The pulse radiolysis results are compared with those for other aromaticcompounds such as triphenylethylene, tetraphenylethylene and perylene.The appreciable spectral shift is characteristic of the diphenylpolyeneradical cations.</TEXT></DOC>
