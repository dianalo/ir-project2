 To help realize that vision, we should examine our ways ofseeing, understanding, and looking into things.andP;  Destructive testing isneither kind nor gentle.andP;  Remote sensing may suffer some quantumuncertainties, a la Schroedinger's cat and the generalized uncertaintyprinciple (sounds like a great name for a band, eh?), but it definitely iseasier on the observed than shaking it 'till it breaks or setting it on fire.andM;Besides, some things you don't particularly want destroyed while you find outwhat makes them tick.andP;  Tomography would be useless if a CAT scanner reduced apatient to ashes.andP;  A similar seismography technique would be of dubious useif it caused earthquakes.andM;Most of what I have read in the past few years has been about perception andpattern recognition.andP;  Much of the research concerns extracting meaning from asignal, whether linear as in sound or planar as in sight.andP;  By the way, neuralnetworks and other parallel-processing schemes seem to excel in this area.andM;LIGHTSandM;One area of interest for remote sensing is illumination.andP;  In many situations,lighting can be controlled to enhance certain traits or diminish others, suchas side illumination to enhance shadows for texture recognition orultraviolet light to make chemical compounds fluoresce.andP;  Natural or incidentlighting can cause problems in distinguishing the observed object fromartifacts of the lighting.andP;  The energy spectrum used might span the entirerange, from microwaves through deep infrared visible light and ultraviolet togamma radiation.andP;  In seismography and sonography, the light is actually soundwaves generated by the object or something that causes the object to vibrate.andM;CAMERAandM;To take an image it is necessary to have a sensor responding to theappropriate energy range and type.andP;  The most commonly used sensors, or atleast the most commonly seen, use the near-infrared to blue spectrum.andP;  CATscans use X-rays; sonograms use ultrasound for greater resolution.andO;Seismographic sensors use much longer waves and compensate for resolutionloss by increasing the number of sensors.andP;  They try to recoup on the acuityby extracting much of their information from phase angles.andP;  In fact,detecting and acquiring signals is one of the most active and wide-rangingendeavors on or off the earth.andP;  We capture signals of all kinds witheverything from billion-dollar satellites and radar installations to thefillings in my Aunt Minnie's teeth, which receive the local heavy-metalstation on cold, clear winter nights.andM;ACTIONandM;Here is where the rubber meets the road.andP;  Detected signals must betransformed several times before they can be used.andP;  Aside from the trivial(for AI purposes anyway) mathematical scaling, rotations, transpositions, andother massaging that a raw signal undergoes, we are left with theconsiderable problem of building some framework to encapsulate this massageddata.andP;  The framework should discriminate between the important and theinsignificant.andM;Of course, significance requires intelligence and understanding in theacquisition as well as the signal itself.andP;  Stare fixedly at a spot on a blankwall without moving your eyes-your field of vision will eventually &quot;greyout.&quot; Your peripheral vision should be the first to go, followed bysolarization of the objects in your field of direct visual attention.andO;Solarization is the reduction of gradation into contrast -edge detection, ifyou will.andP;  Your ocular neural net also does line and arc detection beforeyour brain ever gets a signal.)andM;Moving your eys restores your field of vision, because our optic nerves andtheir associated processing and detection neural net react to motion and havea bias toward it.andP;  This bias occurs because the detection predators or preyare, if you'll excuse the Darwinian reference, favored for survival.andP;  Whileit would appear reasonable to be more interested in moving, as opposed toinert, things, it's not the right mechanism to keep you out of quicksand orfrom eating tuna casserole.andM;INTERPRETATIONandM;So far we have confronted only acquisition.andP;  This leaves the entire questionof interpretation open to, well, interpretation.andM;One important attribute of good vision is object recognition without regardto scaling (matched dimensionalities, if you will).andP;  You must describe anobject in terms of whatever metrics can be derived from that object.andP;  Thisderivation can be done purely from edge- and center-line detection and otherfast and simple algorithms, though I suspect there are as many objectclassification schemes as there are implementations.andM;The problem with simple algorithms is deciding where an object leaves off andanother object or background begins.andP;  Shading can be used to extrapolateshape, though this introduces the possibility of artifacts, opticalillusions, and other trompe l'oeil to define the boundaries of an object.andO;Stereoscopy allows the simple, almost brute force, matching of scenes toprovide measurements of arbitrary scale in three dimensions, yielding themeans to detect discontinuities.andM;A trade-off exists between acuity, the number of pixels acquired, andresolution, being in this case the time it takes to process a scene andextract relevant information.andP;  Definition goes through many levels until asatisfactory description of an object or scene can be acquired.andP;  The betterdefined and described an object is, regardless of the representation schemeand as long as that scheme is internally consistent, the easier thepattern-matching process.andM;The previous paragraph contained a key concept: relevance.andP;  It exists purelyin the context of an application.andP;  For the military, observing theconstruction of Grenadian runways was relevant.andP;  For the Canadian Ministry ofAgriculture, tracking the progress of a plague of locusts across the prairieswas relevant.andP;  For a forest-product company, monitoring fires in northernOntario was relevant.andP;  For Ducks Unltd., examining the types and condition ofNorth America's wetlands was relevant.andM;AIl this information, and much more besides, was gathered from satelliteimagery.andP;  And almost all of it had to be extracted by hand and eye.andP;  We stillhave a long way to go, but look on the bright side: doctors know if theirpatient has a brain tumor without exploratory surgery.andM;THE BOOKSHELFandM;I'm sorry this month's book shelf is so long.andP;  I've compressed a few years ofravaging the book stores like a Visigoth and many nights alone with thereading light into a single column.andP;  We have so much more to cover that I maynot come back to this topic for a while.andM;Satellite Photography Of Canada.andP;  Camden East, Ont., Canada: Camden HousePublishing, 1989.andM;AIthough a quarter of 1990 has already passed, it might be interesting topick up this rather striking calendar.andP;  Its full of Landsat imagery of theCanadian landscape.andM;Satellite Images: Photographs of Canada from Space, by Brian Banks, CamdenEast, Ont., Canada: Camden House Publishing, 1989.andM;This book is lovely and informative.andP;  For instance, I found out how much itcosts to buy a Landsat image.andP;  (I'll stick to digitizing photocopies.) Thebook also compares the French Spot and American Landsat systems.andM;Premieres Images de Spot, by Jean Dieuzaide, 112th monograph of a collectionpublished by the Galerie Municipale du Chateau d'Eau, Toulouse, France, 1987.andM;This little booklet (my copy is in French, it may be available in English)contains striking Spot images.andP;  Especially interesting for people intofractals is an image of Libreville in Zaire-it looks just like a fractaltree.andM;Does God Play Dice? The Mathematics of Chaos, by Ian Stewart, Oxford, U.K.:andO;Basil Blackwell, 1989.andM;If you're into chaos, this book is for you.andP;  I ordered it as soon as I sawthe ad in Scientific American; it took forever to arrive but it was worth thewait.andP;  The book explores chaos from a topologist's perspective.andP;  Stewartgives a good overview of what topology really is and explains the way chaosbreaks the rules by explaining the rules chaos breaks.andP;  If you've already gotChaos by James Gleick you'll see some of the same illustrations from adifferent perspective.andM;Readings in Computer Vision, by Martin Fisher and Oscar Firschein (eds.), SanMateo, Calif.: Morgan Kaufmann, 1987.andP;  This book contains many gems andtechniques that can be adapted and integrated into applications where visionis a means of gathering information.andP;  It even has a section devoted toparallel computer architectures for computer vision and concludes with a goodbibliography.andM;Proceedings: Image Understanding Workshop two vols., San Mateo, Calif: MorganKaufmann, 1988.andM;This excellent, though physically imposing, DARPA-sponsored collection ofresearch papers contains a lot of information about vision, color, texture,edge and motion detection, and stereoscopic vision.andP;  The work is of suchscope that I won't even attempt to describe it.andM;Deep Black Space Espionage and National Security, by William E. Burrows, NewYork, N.Y.: Random House, 1986andM;People interested in the history and uses of satellite imagery will want toread this book.andP;  AIthough some may find espionage and reconnaissancedepressing subjects, I take heart in the fact that satellites have avoidedmore conflicts than they have abetted, and the future of peace might welldepend on the ability to verify adherence to treaties.andP;  The book also hassome dynamite pictures of the Nikolaiev shipyard from 504 miles away.andP;  (Theresolution is about one foot.) Astounding, when you think that these picturesare six years old and progress has not slowed.andM;Charles-A.andP;  Rovira is serious but never solemn.andP;  He would like John R. Searleto ship him a bucket of biologically produced mental content.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
