During a weekend congress in Duisburg, the Greens elected a newand diverse slate of leaders to replace a leadership long dominatedby radicals.   There were also signs of moves within the party to consider theprospects of a possible coalition government with the mainopposition Social Democratic Party if Chancellor Helmut Kohl'sgoverning Christian Democrats lose next year's federal elections.   More than 600 Greens delegates came to Duisburg to try to put theparty of leftists, anti-nuclear activists, feminists andenvironmentalists back on its feet after its radical leadership wasbrought down in December.   On Saturday night, the Greens elected new leaders who are lesscontroversial and more moderate than their predecessors _ animportant new change for parliament's most vocal party.   But Otto Schily, a founder of the Greens and a respected memberof Parliament, says he fears the party that holds 41 of the 497seats in parliament could still face problems in improving its voterappeal.   ``There are still Greens who insist on holding onto theirideological and dogmatic ideas who could hinder our access tocitizens whose support we really need,'' Schily told The AssociatedPress.   For the first time in recent years, a member of the Greens'moderate ``realos'' (realists) faction was elected as one of the topthree leaders _ Ruth Hammerbacher, a state lawmaker from LowerSaxony.   The two others are also completely new to the leadership: VerenaKrieger, who comes from the party's radical ranks, and Ralf Fuecks,whose ideas fall somewhere between those of his two colleagues.   The Greens tried to find a leadership that represents a widerange of party interests and to avoid giving all power to a singlefaction.   Jutta Ditfurth, one of the radical leaders ousted in December,stunned the congress by saying she plans to quit the party nextyear. She blamed moderate Greens for her decision.   But in an unusual show of party unity, several other Greensrejected Ms. Ditfurth's attacks.   The 39,000-member Greens Party, which sprang from protest groupsin the late 1970s, has long been divided by ideologicaldisagreements between radical and moderate elements.   The disputes have pitted party members willing to work withinestablished political procedures against Ms. Ditfurth's radicalwing, the so-called ``fundis'' (fundamentalists), who see littlevalue in pursuing a pragmatic legislative course.   After fundis took control of the party leadership in 1987, theybegan returning the party to its radical roots and a highlyconfrontational style of politics. That course stalled any effectiveaction by the party in parliament.   In December, however, moderate Greens forced the fundis' ousterfrom the party leadership with a no-confidence vote.   Moderate Greens have an added morale boost from the strongpossibility that the Alternative List, the Greens' sister party inWest Berlin, will join with the Social Democrats to run the city'sgovernment after the Christian Democrats were ousted from power inlast month's state elections.</TEXT></DOC>
