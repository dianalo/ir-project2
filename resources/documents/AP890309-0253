The filing under Chapter 11 in U.S. Bankruptcy Court in New Yorkis designed to give tottering Eastern a reprieve from bills anddebts while it tries to restructure and extricate itself from theworst crisis in the history of the 60-year-old airline.   At a news conference today, Eastern boss Frank Lorenzo said theanimosity many union leaders have expressed toward him have ``hurtmy family and me.''   ``But I suggest that the intensive focus on a single person doesa real gross injustice to the real issues that are at stake inairline deregulation and, indeed, in our business climate today,''he said.   ``The issue is fundamentally whether a troubled and sick businessin a competitive marketplace should be allowed  whichexpired in June. There was no immediate word what effect the courtfiling would have on talks.   Also today, the U.S. House Public Works Committee was expected toapprove a measure that would force a reluctant President Bush totemporarily halt the strike. The bill has gloomy prospects in theSenate and at the White House, and the committee's meeting waspostponed at least until afternoon after the court filing.   In a desperate effort to help stem its losses, Eastern reducedone-way fares on its Northeast shuttle to $12 on weekends, from$69-$99, and to $49 on weekdays, down from $99.   George Brennan, marketing vice president, denied the slashedfares were a move to protect the pending $365 million sale of theshuttle to developer Donald Trump.   ``We are confident the sale will go through,'' despite thebankruptcy filing, Bakes said today.   Pan Am Corp., a competitor, said it would not match the fares.   USAir, meanwhile, announced that months of talks had produced a$70 million deal with Eastern to acquire the airline's eight gatesat Philadelphia International Airport, third-largest of Miami-basedEastern's four hubs.   Eastern stood to gain $15 million more in a separate deal,selling USAir its Philadelphia-Toronto and Philadelphia-Montrealroutes for $15 million.   Both deals would require government approval that could takemonths.   Eastern's sister airline, Houston-based Continental, announced itwas assuming Eastern's lucrative New York-Miami route beginningtoday with four daily daily round-trip flights.   Among other developments:   _ Pilots at other airlines continued strictly adhering to safetyrules, but for a second day there was little evidence of flightdelays.   _ In New York, a U.S. District judge scheduled a hearing today onwhether to extend a ban against commuter rail sympathy strikes. OnWednesday, a federal appeals court refused to lift the judge's orderpreventing the Eastern strike from paralyzing New York's commuterrail lines.   _ Eastern lawyers have filed notice with a federal appeals courtin Atlanta on plans to continue efforts to force non-striking pilotsto cross picket lines. Bakes said the appeal would not be filedtoday.   _ In Philadelphia, a federal judge issued a preliminaryinjunction extending a temporary restraining order that prohibitedlocal rail unions from honoring pickets set up by Machinists.</TEXT></DOC>
