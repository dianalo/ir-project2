While the officials concede that clever disinformation could be throwing them off the track, they theorize from largely circumstantial evidence that the PLO may recently have taken custody of Mithileswhar Singh, the Indian educator who was released, and three Americans who were kidnapped with him on Jan. 24, 1987 by Iranian-backed Shiite terrorists in Beirut.    These officials, who asked that their names not be used, and a senior State Department official say the U.S. continues to believe Iran has influence over whoever is holding Mr. Singh's three companions, Americans Robert Polhill, Alann Steen and Jesse Turner. Intelligence officials believe three other small terrorist cells, which are thought to be holding six more Americans, are more firmly allied with Iran.    If the PLO has entered the hostage affair, U.S. officials say, it is probably because its leader Yasser Arafat, who is seeking a visa to visit the U.S., wants to arrange a quick release of the three Americans to reap the public-relations benefits. But that might not be easy. A State Department official told reporters yesterday in West Germany there aren't any signs that any Americans will be freed soon.    U.S. officials base their theory that the PLO may currently control the hostages on a variety of signs. From the start, the kidnappings 21 months ago of Messrs. Polhill, Singh, Steen and Turner, all professors at Beirut University College, haven't fit the pattern of Iranian-sponsored terrorism in Lebanon, senior U.S. officials note. And four recent communiques from Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine, the group claiming to hold the four, were strikingly different from hostage statements issued by Shiite fundamentalists.    Intelligence sources say the recent communiques are written in much better Arabic than the Lebanese Shiite terrorists use. The new communiques also are more conciliatory than earlier messages, none contain fundamentalist rhetoric and all seek only U.S. support for the Palestinian cause in exchange for the hostages' release, American analysts say.    In addition, one sharp-eyed expert noticed that a new photograph of Mr. Singh and the three Americans showed them drinking tea. A Middle Eastern analyst says Lebanese usually drink coffee at such occasions; Palestinians drink tea.    In addition, intelligence sources said although there have been extensive recent discussions between Iranian leaders and Lebanese terrorists about releasing hostages held by other Lebanese terrorist cells, there apparently has been little contact between Tehran and Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine.    The hard-line leaders in Tehran who midwifed the creation of the pro-Iranian terror in Lebanon appear to be losing ground, and Iranian financial and political support for fundamentalist groups in Lebanon is beginning to dwindle, U.S. and European officials believe. As a result, they say, groups such as the Islamic Jihad for the Liberation of Palestine may have begun looking for new patrons.    &quot;There is a strong Palestinian hand in this,&quot; says one U.S. official. &quot;They probably got into it to get some favorable publicity by arranging the hostages' release, but they've gotten themselves in the middle of the hostage-holding business.&quot;    It has never been widely known, but some Shiite terrorists holding Americans hostage formerly worked for a PLO terror group called Force 17, U.S. analysts say. In 1986, U.S. and Israeli intelligence analysts believe, the PLO and Lebanese terrorist Imad Mugniyah, who is believed to be holding Americans Terry Anderson and Thomas Sutherland, conspired to kidnap two Cypriot students, then give Mr. Arafat credit for securing their release.    U.S. officials concede the possibility that the Shiite terrorists, who long have conducted a vigorous disinformation campaign to keep their hostages' whereabouts secret, are manufacturing the evidence of Palestinian involvement.    But if debriefings of Mr. Singh buttress the suspicion that the PLO is holding Americans, the news could doom Mr. Arafat's chances of getting a U.S. visa to address the United Nations this fall and torpedo whatever chance exists for the U.S. to revive Arab-Israeli peace negotiations. </TEXT></DOC>
