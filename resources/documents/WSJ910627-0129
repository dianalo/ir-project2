The ministry's inquiries, which fall short of a full-scaleinvestigation, expand the scope of its current evaluation ofimproper dealings at Japan's Big Four securities companies.On Monday, Nomura's Yoshihisa Tabuchi and Nikko SecuritiesCo.'s Takuya Iwasaki resigned as presidents of their firms toaccept responsibility for their companies' ties to SusumuIshii and for improperly paying hundreds of millions ofdollars to compensate major clients for investment losses.</LP><TEXT>   Ministry officials are trying to find out if actions byNomura employees had any connection with the doubling in theshare price of Tokyu Corp., a large Japanese railway concern,during the final two months of 1989. The ministry officialswould like to determine if Nomura violated a 1974 directivebarring securities houses from attempting to manipulate shareprices by temporarily concentrating their research andmarketing resources on the stock of a single firm. Regulatorssay that Nomura brokers traded heavily in Tokyu as its shareprice leapt.   Mr. Ishii, the former head of the Inagawa-kai crimesyndicate and one of Japan's most celebrated mobsters,acquired a large stake in Tokyu shares between March andOctober 1989. When the Tokyu shares soared in November, heused his Tokyu stock to secure loans of 25 billion yen($180.6 million) from the two brokerage houses. Bothsecurities firms say they made the loans through a thirdparty whom they didn't realize was acting on Mr. Ishii'sbehalf.   A Nomura spokesman said that while the firm is aware ofthe inquiry, it hasn't been contacted directly by theministry about the transactions. At the news conferenceannouncing his resignation, Nomura's Mr. Tabuchi declined toanswer questions about whether Nomura played a role inpushing up the price of Tokyu stock, citing the need topreserve the confidentiality of its relations with itsclients.   Japanese newspaper reports in the past week allege thatNomura bid up the price of Tokyu shares, using its network ofmore than 3,000 salesmen in 150 branches to whip up investorinterest. Tomoko Aikawa, a Nomura spokeswoman, said thecompany had issued buy recommendations on Tokyu shares, butdenied that it did anything illegal in recommending thestock. Tokyu was &quot;only one of many recommendations&quot; thatNomura made, she said.   In another scandal-related development, Japanese pressreports alleged that Mr. Ishii participated in an effort tobid up the stock of Honshu Paper Co. The price of thatcompany's shares also nearly doubled between November 1989and last August. The reports said Tokyo police wereinvestigating the share run-up, but a police spokesman saidhe wasn't aware of any investigation.   And Kyodo, the Japanese news service, reported that Mr.Ishii promised a lucrative contract to a major Japaneseconstruction company on condition that the company lend himfive billion yen. Kyodo, quoting police investigators, saidTokyo Sagawakyubin Co., a leading transporation conglomerate,helped Mr. Ishii's Inagawakai crime syndicate get the loan byallowing it to promise the construction firm a contract todevelop the conglomerate's 20 billion-yen resort in Shizuoka.   According to the investigators, the construction companyis also among 12 corporations that lent a total of 38.4billion yen to Mr. Ishii in return for &quot;exclusive&quot; golf clubmemberships that police say had no value, Kyodo said. Policewithheld the name of the construction company, saying onlythat it is traded on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.</TEXT></DOC>
