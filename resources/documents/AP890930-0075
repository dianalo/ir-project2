Ernestina Garcia brought 20 candles, each in a paper sack thatglowed at the edge of the chasm, filled with about 12 feet ofstagnant water.   ``We usually do this at Christmas, and I thought it would be anice thing to do for the kids,'' she said one evening last week.   Her friend Rose Mary Rios was back the next morning, exactly aweek after the Sept. 21 crash, happy to see that the candles hadburned all night.   Neither woman had children on the bus, but both knew victims inthe small, South Texas community of Alton, where the tragedy isstill too horrible for some to believe.   ``It's going to take some time,'' said Mayor San Juanita Zamora.``It will take time.''   Activities at Mission Junior High and Mission High School, wherethe victims and 59 survivors attended, were returning to normal bythe end of the week. Football resumed with a junior high gameThursday afternoon.   Then Friday, the community was shaken again when 15-year-oldElizabeth Flores died at Mission Hospital, becoming the 21stfatality. She had been in a coma and on life-support systems sincethe accident.   But Friday night's football games went on. Keeping the studentsbusy and moving ahead with life are the best remedies, said headfootball coach Sonny Detmer of Mission High School.   ``It's a terrible thing it had to happen, but at least ithappened during football season,'' the coach said. ``If it hadhappened any other time of the year it would have been depressionuntil football season started again.''   ``You can't tell them to forget it, because there's no waythey're ever going to forget it,'' Detmer said. ``You just tellthem to go on.''   Counselors in the region mobilized and will continue to help thestudents, their teachers and families and others in the grievingcommunity, officials said.   ``We've had several teachers who I would say took it harder thanthe kids,'' said John Abbenante, junior high principal.   He started the week with an emotional talk over the school'spublic address system, while tearful teachers and counselorsembraced shaken survivors and their friends.   More and more survivors came back to school, some by bus, as theweek progressed, he said, but a few found it impossible to stay allday.   Juan V. Granados, 12, who escaped through a window in the bus,has started going to school in his father's car, and didn't know ifhe would become a bus rider again.   ``Maybe,'' he said.   Some of the scores of rescuers also have had trouble coping withthe sight of so many young people dying. A group counseling sessionwith the Charter Palms Hospital of McAllen helped, said ShawnSnider, an emergency medical technician with the Alamo FireDepartment who cannot remember any of the dead children's faces.   A dramatic Associated Press picture transmitted around the worldshowed Snider and another rescuer as one of them tried toresuscitate a student pulled from the murky waters. Snider said theboy did not live.   ``When I looked over that cliff and saw all that yellow (thesubmerged bus), it was like somebody hit me with a 2-by-4, and Istarted shaking,'' said Snider, who thought he was used to seeingtrauma victims. ``Everybody's dealing with it. Everybody's having ahard time.''   Red Cross volunteer Anna Rubio said the organization would bearound for a long time helping victims' families, citing a parent``who has not worked for a week and will need gas money.'' Theorganization is using a trailer at Alton Elementary for itsoperations.   Daniel Rodriguez, father of 16-year-old victim Ana DeliaRodriguez, said his main concern was obtaining a headstone for hisdaughter's grave.   Valley Coca-Cola Bottling Co., owner of the truck that wentthrough a stop sign and knocked the bus into the pit, offered topay funeral and medical costs for victims and survivors.   At least one lawsuit has been filed against the company, withothers in the works, according to lawyers.   The National Transportation Safety Board is winding down itsinvestigation but probably will not have a report out for ninemonths, said chief investigator Bob Barlett. The NTSB has concludedthat the truck's brakes worked well enough to halt it at the stopsign in Alton.   No charges, however, have been filed against the truck driver,25-year-old Ruben Perez of Mission, on administrative suspensionfrom his duties.   No guard rail separated the pit from the roadway 20 feet awayand no road signs warned of its presence, but authorities said thatwas not unusual in south Texas. The pit was one of thousands dug inthe Southwest to mine caliche, a sandy gravel mixture that occursnaturally in desert areas and is used for construction.   Hidalgo County officials are talking about ways to make the pitssafer.   Residents are discussing a memorial at the site, which alongwith candles has been marked by several wreaths. Other reminders ofthe tragedy are a child's red tennis shoe, two T-shirts, theremnants of notebook paper and a blue ballpoint pen floating on thewater's surface.</TEXT></DOC>
