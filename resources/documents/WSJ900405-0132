It will hunt forblack holes and help explain the birth of galaxies.   It's also an example of Big Science gone bad.</LP><TEXT>   The $1.54 billion telescope is at least seven years behindschedule, $1 billion over budget and doesn't work as well asexpected. The reasons for that are more political thanscientific. The National Aeronautics and Space Administrationunderestimated the telescope's price to win congressionalapproval. Then the agency drove up the cost and complexity bytying the telescope to the space shuttle, and using theproject to stave off layoffs.   &quot;We've been rolled too many times by megascienceprojects,&quot; complains Rep. Bob Traxler, the Michigan Democratwho heads the appropriations panel overseeing NASA. &quot;Theydevelop a constituency and keep going, no matter what thecost.&quot; In the past month, for instance, the Energy Departmentincreased the price of its superconducting supercolliderone-third to about $8 billion, and NASA engineers warned thatthe $30 billion space station faces costly design changes.   The space telescope is a case study in how scienceprojects get out of hand. From the beginning, astronomers andNASA managers prized salesmanship as much as science. &quot;A NASAmission gets started by advertising the potential of anidea,&quot; says Robert Brown, an astronomer who spent two yearsas the space telescope's chief scientist. &quot;Then you solve theproblems you find.&quot;   NASA's biggest problem in the 1970s, when the agencystarted selling and building the space telescope, was a lackof political support. The agency was desperately trying toline up backing for the space shuttle and fend off attemptsto close its big Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville,Ala. The space telescope was designed to aid both efforts --even though the cost to the program proved to beconsiderable.   Promoting the shuttle was the key. NASA designed thetelescope so it could be launched into orbit and serviced bythe shuttle, giving the shuttle a prominent role in spacescience. Shuttle servicing also gave NASA a rationale toslash the telescope's price tag so it would pass muster withCongress. NASA could dispense with plans for costly testingby promising to lug the telescope back from space and fix iton the ground if anything important broke.   &quot;It was a political plus to use the shuttle,&quot; says NoelHinners, a former NASA science official who pushed thetelescope through Congress by citing the shuttle's technicalmerits, too. But years after winning approval of thetelescope, NASA dropped its plans to haul the satellite backto Earth -- fearing that the extra handling could harm theinstrument.   NASA kept its plans for in-orbit servicing, but that ledto other problems. Designing the telescope so it would besafe for astronauts to work on in space increased costssharply. The Challenger shuttle disaster in 1986 delayed thetelescope's launch by three years. Meanwhile, the orbit theshuttle can reach -- about 350 miles above the ground -- isso low that Earth blocks the telescope's view 40% of thetime. Overall, the space telescope will spend only one-thirdof its time making observations, just slighty better than anEarth-bound telescope, which can only work at night.   Internal NASA politics also set back the space telescope.NASA split the project between the Marshall facility, whichthe White House was threatening to close, and the agency'straditional astronomy center, Goddard Space Flight Center, inGreenbelt, Md. The two centers fought regularly over testingand design issues, say scientists involved in the project,while the telescope fell behind schedule and its costescalated.   Marshall also was forced by the Pentagon to limit thenumber of managers it assigned to oversee the telescope. Themilitary feared that too many civilians would learn abouttechnology useful for spy satellites, says Robert Smith, aSmithsonian Institution historian who has written a bookabout the telescope. As a result of these tussles, says Mr.Smith, NASA managers didn't catch engineering problems earlyenough.   Now, in some important respects, the telescope isn't asgood as advertised. Its ground-based computer system iswoefully inefficient, says C.R. O'Dell, a former telescopechief scientist, who estimates that his observing time on thetelescope has been cut nearly in half because of the problem.Scientists say the telescope's tracking system isn't quickenough to follow storm systems on nearby planets, whichscientists want to study to help learn more about hurricaneson Earth. Its parts are aging.   The project's huge budget also led NASA to rule outsmaller missions that it could have launched sooner. If NASAhad built a smaller, cheaper telescope, &quot;many of thediscoveries that {Hubble} will make might have been made 10years earlier,&quot; writes Freeman Dyson, a physicist at theInstitute for Advanced Studies, in the astronomy magazine&quot;Sky andamp; Telescope.&quot;   NASA officials believe that the launch of the spacetelescope will silence the critics. Lennard Fisk, theagency's space-science chief, says shuttle servicing willenable NASA to update the telescope's instruments and repairit if anything goes wrong. Edward Weiler, a NASAspace-telescope scientist, says the instrument &quot;representsthe biggest leap in astronomical capability since Galileo puta telescope to his eye.&quot;   But a little skepticism is in order. In his book, &quot;TheSpace Telescope,&quot; Mr. Smith recounts an exchange a few yearsback between James Beggs, who then headed NASA, and Rep.Edward Boland, the Massachusetts Democrat who then headed theappropriations subcommittee responsible for the agency.   &quot;The space telescope will be the eighth wonder of theworld,&quot; boasted the NASA administrator.   &quot;It ought to be at that price,&quot; replied the lawmaker.   ---                      Hubble Chronology                                                                                                          1946 -- Princeton astronomer Lyman Spitzer proposesorbiting space telescope                                                                                                          1958 -- NASA established                                                                                                          1962 -- National Academy of Sciences recommends a spacetelescope                                                                                                          1971 -- Early NASA space-telescope studies                                                                                                          1977 -- NASA wins congressional approval of spacetelescope; cost estimate of $435 million; 1983 launch date                                                                                                          1981 -- Space-telescope mirror completed, one year behindschedule                                                                                                          1983 -- Launch delayed to 1986; cost estimate of $1.18billion                                                                                                          1984 -- NASA gives up idea of bringing space telescopeback to earth for servicing                                                                                                          1986 -- Launch delayed after Challenger disaster                                                                                                          April 10, 1990 -- Scheduled launch of space telescope;cost estimate $1.54 billion</TEXT></DOC>
