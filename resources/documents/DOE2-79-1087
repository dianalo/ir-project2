Within this context, the classification scheme ofAvron-Seiler-Simon for non-degenerate energy bands is extended to covergeneral parameter spaces, whole their sum rule is generalized to covercases with degenerate bands as well. Additive topological quantum numbersare defined, and these are shown to be conserved in energy band &quot;collisions&quot;.The conservation laws dictate that when some invariants are non-vanishing,no energy gap can develop in a set of degenerate bands. This gives riseto a series of splitting rules.</TEXT></DOC>
