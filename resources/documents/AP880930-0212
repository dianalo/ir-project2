Powered by redesigned booster rockets, urged skyward by thehopes and tears of a nervous nation, Discovery took America back tothe last frontier Thursday.   On paper, its mission was simple: test the new features of theshuttle and deploy a communications satellite.   But in the hearts of millions, Discovery headed for the heavensto erase the vision of explosion frozen for 32 months, to expungethe haywire contrails that blotted the Florida sky, to place in thepast the public deaths of the Challenger Seven.   ``This does not mean there are not terrible scars left byChallenger. But they are no longer wounds,'' said former astronautJoe Allen, now an executive at a local aerospace company.   ``I've always marveled at the resiliency of humans. We arecreatures that throughout history have been beset by challenge andtragedy, and for whatever reason, able to grieve and pick ourselvesup,'' Allen said.   Said Jane Smith, widow of Challenger astronaut Michael Smith,``We feel like we are all, in a sense, flying with them.''   But back on Earth, the uncertainty for America's space programis far from over. NASA's abilities and safety efforts are stillscrutinized. Since the free-spending Apollo days, the agency hashad persistent problems getting money from Congress, some membersof which now question the expense of a space station _ NASA's nextgoal which is at least eight years away.   NASA's woes mounted as the Soviet Union was setting records forspace duration. When the five Discovery astronauts reached orbitThursday, three cosmonauts were already there aboard the Mir spacestation, two of them more than halfway through a mission planned tolast a year.   It will take some time to catch up. If the United States hopesto send men to Mars, for example, NASA must learn much more aboutthe effects of long duration in space, astronauts say.   Most observers say the United States still has the lead in spacetechnology, but the Soviets, perhaps to underscore that they areclosing the gap, released the first photos of its space orbiter, ashuttle look-alike, about 90 minutes before Discovery's gloriousliftoff.   Still, the roar of Thursday's launch and the shuttle program'sreDiscovery of space turned the questions to cheers across thecountry.   ``When this mission is on the ground, all these other milestonesbecome real goals,'' said astronaut Linda Godwin, who has been withNASA three years and is not yet scheduled to fly. ``This step hadto be accomplished. Everything is contingent on when we get backflying. I think it's a turning point in a sense that Challenger isno longer our last flight.   ``Now we have new memories. For a while, all we had wasChallenger.''   For NASA, the last 32 months have been an emotional andtechnological roller-coaster.   Those seeking the causes of the Challenger explosion found thatthe fault was not just the failure of an O-ring seal, but also afailure of communications within NASA _ warnings of O-ring troubleswere ignored or not relayed to launch officials.   While grounded, NASA went through a complete shakeup, all theway from top officials down to engineers and astronauts who left towork elsewhere.   Redesigning the shuttle's booster rockets and then getting themapproved for flight took longer than many within NASA had hoped.   Morale sank even lower.   ``In many ways, it's a thankless task. At this time of personaltragedy and low morale, you've still got a mountain of work todo,'' said Allen, who's still closely involved with people andprojects here at the Johnson Space Center. ``You have to tip yourhat to the NASA worker that went through that.''   Astronauts launched themselves into higher positions in theagency, assuming administrative and oversight roles not enjoyedsince the early days of the space program. They sat in on meetingsthey had not been invited to before, and training continued onmissions slated for the next decade.   But it wasn't until this summer that morale started to climb,officials said.   ``Even the last week, it (the launch) seemed remote because ofbad weather and another leak,'' Godwin said. ``Then we startedseeing things happen (in preparation for the launch) that we hadn'tseen before in the last 2{ years.''   As Thursday's countdown progressed, the emotional mix here wasas volatile as the fuel in the giant orange external fuel tank.   Some of the astronauts gathered in the same room where they hadviewed the Challenger launch.   ``There was a lot of tension. It was a long two minutes. Youcan't help but compare,'' said Godwin. ``Challenger could have beenany crew. I don't think anybody can be strapped in there on top ofthat rocket and those boosters and not realize what you're sittingon top of. But we get through life thinking it's not going to beme.''   As Discovery lifted off and cheers erupted all around theJohnson Space Center, the flight directors in Mission Control heldback. Nary a sound, until 2 minutes, 4 seconds into flight, whenDiscovery shed its solid rocket boosters safely, and applause brokeout.   NASA, back in the saddle, contained its glee within thestatement, ``Discovery, performance nominal'' _ space parlance forno problems.   With Discovery's nominal performance, and landing scheduled forMonday, the talk has shifted even beyond the next shuttle flight.   Astronauts are already training in a mockup of a space station.Shuttle missions are mapped out to 1992. The talk has turned backto a space competition with the Soviets. Never, actually, was theredoubt that America would not explore space.   ``We went to space originally out of a sense of competition,''Allen said. ``I do believe the challenge of space is certainlyinherently great enough to challenge any particular country thathas some confidence in its destiny and even if there was a singlecountry on the planet, people would still go into space.''   Wherever Discovery leads us, it surely leads us out of ourChallenger mourning. Even for some relatives of the lost crew,Discovery may mark a final picking-up of the pieces.   ``I hope for the (Challenger) crew, for my husband, that todaybrought him a greater peace,'' Lorna Onizuka, widow of missionspecialist Ellison Onizuka, said here after the launch.   The triumph of Discovery may bring a sense of peace to thenation as well. The fiery explosion caused the most public deathsfor America since the assassination of President John F. Kennedy.And as the Discovery launch repeated the sequence that led to thatmoment of horror, many watching cried _ tears of joy, tears of fear.   The spaceship cleared the launch tower and headed toward thestars. About 70 seconds into flight, Mission Control radioed,``Discovery, go at throttle up,'' a repeat of the final words sentto the Challenger crew.   The words were so, so familiar.   ``Roger go!'' exclaimed commander Rick Hauck.   Roger go, Discovery.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Scott McCartney, the AP Southwest regionalreporter, based in Dallas, helped cover the Challenger disaster.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Oct. 2</NOTE></DOC>
