Tawana Brawley told the friend that she and her mother, Glenda,invented the story to keep the mother's live-in boyfriend frombeating Ms. Brawley, New York Newsday reported today.   Ms. Brawley denied the friend's report, the newspaper said.   She was 15 when found Nov. 28, 1987, in a plastic bag, smearedwith dog excrement and racial epithets. She said she had beenabducted and raped over four days by five or six white men, atleast one with a badge.   Hospital tests did not show signs of rape, and witnesses latersaid they saw her at a party during the four-day period.   Activist lawyers C. Vernon Mason and Alton Maddox and the Rev.Al Sharpton advised Miss Brawley and her family not to cooperatewith a grand jury or investigators, claiming white officials wereengaged in a racist cover-up.   The grand jury concluded last fall after a seven-monthinvestigation that the charges were untrue and that her conditionwhen found was not inconsistent with ``having been self-inflicted.''   Attorney General Robert Abrams, the special prosecutor in thecase, told Newsday that Daryl T. Rodriguez's tale was consistentwith the grand jury's findings.   Rodriguez, who began dating Ms. Brawley in the fall of 1987,told the newspaper that within the last two weeks Ms. Brawley toldhim what happened during the time she was supposedly missing.   According to Rodriguez, the invented story went awry when Mrs.Brawley picked up her daughter at a condominium complex inWappingers Falls, north of New York City, and saw two neighborshelping her out of the trash bag. The mother then reported topolice that her daughter had been missing for four days, Rodriguezsaid.   Ms. Brawley, who now lives in Virginia Beach, Va., denied thereport and told Newsday she has not talked to Rodriguez since lastsummer.   Maddox and Sharpton did not immediately respond to messages lefttoday asking them for comment. Mason was out of the country.</TEXT></DOC>
