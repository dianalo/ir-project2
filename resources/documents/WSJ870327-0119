I think this plainly fictional construction would more surprise the Founding Fathers than the odious phenomenon of local rent control.    The Constitution grants only limited power to the federal government and deprives the states of very little. The states (and localities within them) are and should be free to engage in whatever folly their own republican form of government will endure. In the case of rent control, if the ordinance does not affect interstate commerce (the Founders would be surprised to learn that &quot;interstate commerce&quot; could be stretched so far) and if it does not impair existing contracts (the poor seldom have long-term leases), the U.S. Supreme Court has no business butting in.    The case of local rent control presents the court with a golden opportunity to begin restoring constitutional government during the bicentennial of its adoption. By rejecting both the argument that the Fifth Amendment prohibits rent control and the theory behind that argument, the court can hand the liberals a small victory while at the same time demolishing the most pernicious theory that they have ever devised for subverting the Constitution. To again have a written constitution that means what it says is far more important to the nation than reaching the &quot;right&quot; result on a stupid little issue such as rent control in San Jose, Calif.
