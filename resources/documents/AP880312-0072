Officials called the launch Friday night of the West's onlyactive commercial satellite launcher ``a complete success,'' withall operations perfect. It was Ariane's 21st launching and thefirst of eight planned for this year.   The Ariane 3 placed into orbit France's Telecom 1C and theAmerican Spacenet IIIR-Geostar, which includes facilities for TheAssociated Press.   Technicians said the two satellites, placed into orbit by Arianeabove the equator, obtained an altitude of 22,554 miles.   The critical day for the Spacenet satellite is Wednesday, whenits own motor ignites to place it into its definitive orbit 87degrees west above the equator.   Liftoff from the space agency's jungle base on the northerncoast of South America came at 8:28 p.m. local time (6:28 p.m. EST).   The third-stage engine, at fault in three of Ariane's fourfailed launchings, ignited normally four minutes after blastoff,officials said. Twenty minutes after blastoff, the rocket separatedfrom its payload, thrusting the two satellites into geostationarytransfer orbits.   Frederic d'Allest, president of Arianespace, the European SpaceAgency's commercial arm, immediately announced plans for launcheson May 11 and at the end of May. One would be a demonstration ofthe more powerful Ariane 4 rocket, described by ESA as ``the newgeneration of the European launcher.''   ``This success enables us to envision the ambitious program ofeight launches a year,'' d'Allest said after the launch. ``Forthat, vigilance and rigorousness are needed.''   Some experts estimate the commercial space market will be worthmore than $1 billion per year after 1991.   Including Friday's payload, Arianespace has 43 satellites on itsorder books worth $2.36 billion, according to the company.   To keep up with the orders, the Kourou space center has made twolaunch pads available.   The launch Friday was first scheduled for December but wasdelayed for extra tests after abnormalities were detected in theoxygen and liquid hydrogen third-stage engine.   ``We preferred to take the time to understand the problem,''said d'Allest.   Third-stage engine failure was the cause of failed Arianelaunches in September 1982, September 1985 and May 1986. The lastfailure, the 18th launch, left the rocket grounded for more than ayear.   Another failed launch occurred in May 1980 because of a problemwith the first-stage engine.   The 21st launch thrust into orbit the American GTE SpacenetCorp.'s fifth satellite, Spacenet III R-Geostar R01. The satelliteis aimed at increasing the company's telecommunications services inthe United States and helping set up a system of satellitecommunication with mobile units such as trucks, cars and trains.   The satellite, with an expected lifetime of 10 years, weighed2,674 pounds before liftoff and 1,562 pounds in orbit.   GTE Spacenet lost a satellite in the 1985 failed launch.   Two transponders on Spacenet III purchased by the AP are toprovide the New York-based news cooperative with domestic satellitedelivery services over the next 10 years. A satellite being used isnearing the end of its operational service.   The French Telecom IC, the third in a series of satellites ownedby France Telecom, the state-owned telecommunications system. It isto replace Telecom 1-B, which broke down Jan. 15.   With the U.S. space shuttle grounded and America's Titan 4 andDelta rockets not yet competitive, Ariane remains the only activelauncher for commercial satellites in the West.</TEXT></DOC>
