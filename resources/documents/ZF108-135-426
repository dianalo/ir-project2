 In practice, some agencieshave very well developed IRM functions and can get by with minimal oversight.andO;Other agencies need a lot of oversight and actual operating assistance.andM;GCN: Do you approve all computer buys?andM;KOMAREK: Yes.andM;GCN: To what degree do the agencies share information?andM;KOMAREK: When I took this position in 1983, the Labor Department was beingcriticized by a whole series of oversight agencies.andP;  The General ServicesAdministration, the inspector general, the appropriations committees in theHouse and Senate, the General Accounting Office -- all of them to one degreeor another found problems with the way we were doing IRM.andM;First, they felt there was not enough general oversight and direction beingprovided to our programs.andP;  And second, the different parts of the departmentdidn't relate well enough to each other on an IRM basis.andM;For example, in those days the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is afantastically advanced agency in terms of IRM, had one sort of computerenvironment.andP;  Their mission is to develop employment statistics for thecountry and to study the ways Americans are employed.andM;On the other hand, the Employment Training Administration had a differentcomputer environment.andP;  That made it very difficult for the Bureau of LaborStatistics to exchange data with the Employment Training Administration.andM;About two years I got here, Secretary Bill Brock arrived.andP;  One of the firstthings he asked for was a PC for his desk.andP;  Another thing he asked for was abriefing on how are related to each other within the department in terms ofIRM and computing environments.andP;  With his backing, we now have significantcompatibility throughout the department.andM;He said, &quot;Hey, it doesn't make sense to have major operating components inthe department have different computing environments when in fact we wantthose agencies to be related to each other.&quot;andM;In 1983, 1984 and 1985 we had very little compatibility within thedepartment.andP;  In the 1990s we have significant compatibility.andM;GCN: How far along are you in getting where you want to be in compatibilityand information sharing?andM;KOMAREK: I think we're pretty far along.andP;  Like many organizations, we'regoing to a linked PC network throughout the department.andP;  It was interestinghow it developed here.andM;It's difficult to develop compatible networks at the grass roots level in avariety of different organizations, because each agency will want a systemsuitable for its own operating environment.andP;  Because of that and the natureof the procurement process, it is unlikely for different agencies to end upwith the same kinds of systems.andP;  That is what existed here before 1985.andM;In 1985, Secretary Brock instituted the Executive Computer Network, a PCnetwork linking the top offices in the department.andP;  We got each of theassistant secretaries and agency heads and all key members of the secretary'sstaff on an IBM PC-compatible network.andP;  Then we moved down one level and gotall their deputies on this network.andM;Then we found that more and more people below the 18 agency heads wanted toget on the network so they could communicate up to the executive staff and tous in the department.andP;  The next phase was to link each of our 10 regionaloffices.andP;  We did that in 1987 and 1988.andM;A good example of how this worked is that we had a deputy assistant secretaryin the Employment Standards Administration who moved about a year ago to theOccupational Safety and Health Administration as deputy assistant secretary.andM;OSHA had been somewhat behind the rest of the department in getting on boardthis network.andP;  This deputy assistant secretary asked, &quot;Where is my ExecutiveComputer Network hookup?andP;  Why can't I communicate with the other agencies asI used to in my former bureau?&quot;andM;Well, it wasn't too long thereafter that the system spread throughout OSHAand other parts of the department.andM;Basically, it has been top-down.andP;  People have wanted to get on simply tocommunicate upward with all the important people in the department, tocommunicate across agency lines and to regional offices.andM;So a system that started out with an initial PC buy of about 200 will, by theend of 1990, have 5,000 to 6,000 PCs capable of being linked together, with astaff of 18,000 people.andP;  About one of every three desks will have a PC thatcan be linked into this overall network.andM;GCN: Do you have a PC contract out now?andM;KOMAREK: We have two invitations for bids out on the street.andP;  But quitefrankly, over the last couple of years we have bought the major share of PCsthat we need to buy.andM;We may be letting some contracts in thenext year, but this is almost the tailend of the cycle in terms of actually buying PCs.andP;  Most of the PCs werebought last fiscal year and the year before.andM;GCN: When are you thinking about actually awarding the contracts?andM;KOMAREK: That's up in the air.andP;  One of the problems this year is theGramm-Rudman situation.andP;  Our financial situation has changed from what it waswhen we initially wanted to do these IFBs.andP;  So at this time we arere-evaluating.andM;MALIA: We have an installed PC base of 4,000 to 5,000, with several thousandpurchased and not yet delivered.andP;  Of those, 4,000 will be linked in a seriesof local area networks within the agencies to an overall departmental officeautomation environment.andP;  By the end of this fiscal year, we will havecompleted the installation with national and regional offices.andM;GCN: Is there much minicomputer use?andM;MALIA: We have had a series of minicomputer awards on behalf of the agencieswho have a strong programmatic base.andP;  Some of these minicomputers are at theend of their life cycles.andP;  They are being closed out, and the agencies aremigrating into this PC LAN-based office automation environment.andM;Others, because of the nature of their business, are not at the end of theirlife cycles.andP;  But they will ultimately have a linkage into the officeautomation environment.andM;The agencies frequently have two environments.andP;  Their programmatic processingwith their functional staff may work on a minicomputer or mainframe, whereasall the office automation would be a common environment with linkages withinagencies to their programmatic functions.andM;That way we have commonality for purposes of management and administration.andO;Each agency can tailor the solution to its program.andP;  We feel that has givenus the most efficient environment using the technology available.andM;GCN: What about large departmentwide systems?andM;KOMAREK: Well, we do quite a bit of business with Boeing [Computer Services].andO;Our payroll system is on a Boeing service contract, and each agency of thedepartment feeds into the payroll system.andP;  That is probably the only largesystem that is departmentwide.andM;MALIA: We also use the Air Force Civilian Personnel Systems, which happens tobe operated on equipment in Kansas City.andM;GCN: How do you do IRM reviews?andM;KOMAREK: We differentiate agencies with mature programs that are able to do alarge measure of the review themselves.andP;  We can minimize the resources we putinto oversight for them compared with other agencies where we might need tospend a little more time.andM;MALIA: We review procurements for the department.andP;  GSA has a triennial reviewprogram where it asks agencies to analyze the efficiency and effectiveness oftheir processing.andP;  We have departmentwide reviews out of my office, but wesupplement that by the agencies' tailoring some reviews for their ownpurposes.andM;GCN: Let's talk about your Presidential Priority System, the EmployeeRetirement Income Security Act (ERISA) Information System.andP;  How far along isit?andM;KOMAREK: It's three-quarters to 80 percent done.andP;  I think it will beoperational sometime in 1990.andP;  ERISA is a law to protect the pensions andbenefits of employees.andP;  If a large pension system fails, then the PensionBenefit Guaranty Corp. has to take responsibility for it.andP;  That would be veryexpensive if the federal government had to do it very much.andM;The ERISA Information System is designed to take information that employersreport on IRS 5500 forms, put it in machine readable format and edit andanalyze the information.andP;  Like an individual tax return, the system can tellif there is a problem with the information submitted and we need to look atit.andM;For the form to be accepted, it has to pass a series of edits.andP;  [The system]would have the ability to edit large volumes of forms and data in anautomated fashion.andP;  That's very, very important.andM;As with the Internal Revenue Service, certain indicators are contained in theinformation that can make one plan more likely to be audited than anotherplan.andP;  A second feature of ERISA will focus the efforts of our PensionWelfare Benefits Administration investigators on plans that may haveproblems.andP;  So we can preclude situations where the government has to takeover a plan because it goes bankrupt or there is illegality.andM;MALIA: We have an interagency agreement with GSA using Planning ResearchCorp.andP;  We also have an interagency agreement with IRS, and we're using IRSdata.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
