The British builder extended the offer until 12:01 a.m. EDT Saturday. It had expired at 12:01 a.m. Saturday, after having been previously extended.    As of April 22, about 13,896,699, or 53.4%, of the common shares outstanding and 112,207, or 74.8%, of the preferred shares outstanding had been tendered. The common shares tendered, together with the 2,094,100 common shares already owned by BNS-related entities, represent close to 57% of the Pittsburgh building materials concern's common outstanding.    Federal judges in Pittsburgh and Los Angeles have issued injunctions that prevent BNS, the Beazer unit that is making the tender offer, from actively soliciting shares. Beazer contends that the company abided by those orders and that stockholders freely tendered their shares.    A Koppers spokesman had no comment on the extension. </TEXT></DOC>
