In denying the request of the accident victim's parents to subpoena Mr. Krischer, Judge Timothy Poulton argued that such a move would violate the privileged nature of conversations between an attorney and his client. &quot;If we fail to rule as we do, the result would be the erection of a wall between the public and attorneys,&quot; he said.    Mr. Krischer learned the name of the alleged hit-and-run driver shortly after Mark Baltes, a local electrician, was killed on a road near here 2 1/2 years ago; the attorney had unsuccessfully attempted to negotiate a plea bargain with prosecutors. Police have been unable to find the driver, and Mr. Krisher's refusal to divulge the information that could solve the case has enraged many members of the public.    Judge Poulton acknowleged that the case, &quot;has tremendous emotional appeal,&quot; adding that, &quot;It's difficult to rule against the plaintiffs, but I'm convinced that the law requires it.&quot;    Mildred Baltes, the victim's mother, vowed to appeal the decision, saying, &quot;I'm disappointed, but it makes me even more eager to continue.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
