Donaldson Chapoton, deputy assistant treasury secretary for tax policy, told the Senate Finance Subcommittee on Taxation and Debt Management.    Mr. Chapoton was testifying on a package of corrections to the 1986 Tax Reform Act, all of which are supposed to be technical in nature. The bill has attracted the attention of other governments, foreign banks operating in the U.S. and domestic multinational corporations because of a relatively obscure provision, drafted by congressional tax staffers, declaring that unless specific exceptions are listed, the 1986 act shall take precedence over treaty provisions.    Historically, treaties and legislation have been given equal standing in the U.S., with apparent conflicts resolved in court.    Sen. Max Baucus (D., Mont.), the subcommittee chairman, told Mr. Chapoton that he shared the Treasury's concern.    Among other things, tax treaties protect companies doing business internationally from double taxation and some provide specific benefits for U.S. concerns to offset certain concessions granted to foreigners in bargaining over the treaties. </TEXT></DOC>
