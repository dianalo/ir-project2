Companies ranging from battery maker DuracellInternational Inc. to retailer AnnTaylor Stores Corp. soldstock to pare heavy debt loads, and younger companies fromAIDS-related MedImmune Inc. to restaurateur OutbackSteakhouse bankrolled their growth from selling shares toinvestors.</LP><TEXT>   The IPO market began the year dormant, unnerved by thePersian Gulf crisis, but soared in March as the war ended.Investment bankers didn't look back as they hustled to sell$16.4 billion in stock by 360 newly public companies,excluding investment funds, just behind the 1986 record of$18.3 billion. An additional 454 already-public companiessold $29.8 billion more in new shares, making 1991 a recordyear for all stock sales, according to IDD InformationServices Inc.   Investors profited handsomely: Standard andamp; Poor's Corp.'sindex of new issues doubled as of Dec. 30, more-than twicethe full-year rise of 46.6% in the Sandamp;P Mid-Cap Index andthree times the 26.3% gain in the Sandamp;P 500-Stock Index. Manyinvestors simply &quot;flipped&quot; their hot new stocks, or sold themquickly.   As the year closed, investment bankers rushed to push outa big backlog of IPOs and filed an unusually large numberthat they hope to bring to market in 1992. Bankers foreconomically sensitive IPOs, such as USX Corp.'s USX-MarathonGroup, delayed their plans, but underwriters foremerging-growth companies remained bullish.   &quot;There's still a lot of energy out there in terms of newideas, new products and new systems that need capital,&quot; saysGar Richlin, head of investment banking for Alex. Brown andamp;Sons.   Portfolio managers, overwhelmed by the numbers, remaincautious as they sort through a mixed bag of prospects among105 companies that hope to go public this month. &quot;They rangefrom junk with sweetheart deals for management tohigh-quality deals,&quot; says Robert Czepiel, manager of theRobertson Stephens Emerging Growth Fund. &quot;It's a little bitlike lighting a match and looking into your gas tank,&quot; headds. &quot;You don't know if you're going to get your head blownoff.&quot;   As corporate America continues to thirst for equity, IPOsare expected to remain strong throughout 1992, particularlyif President Bush succeeds in getting the economy rollingbefore the election. Look for biotechnology, health-care andcomputer-related IPOs early in the year, says Robert Natale,new-issues market for Standard andamp; Poor's. Next will comecompanies that tend to do well in the early stage of arecovery, such as retailers and entertainment concerns,followed by the big steel, auto and other economicallysensitive companies.   Nearly one-third of the proceeds from last year's IPOswere raised by formerly public companies such as Duracellthat were taken private and piled on debt during theleveraged-buy-out binge of the 1980s. These mostly bigcompanies floated the year's biggest offerings; 54 so-calledreverse LBOs raised $5.2 billion, which was used mostly toshed debt. Their performance was mixed, however, asinvestors' hopes for many economically sensitive companiesfaded along with the economy: Duracell more than doubled, butretailer AnnTaylor fell 42%.   The majority of IPOs continued to be companies goingpublic for the first time. Credit-card specialist MBNA Corp.weighed in as the largest with a $689.3 million offering in aspinoff from MNC Financial, a troubled Maryland bank, androse a robust 58%.   Biotechnology stocks were the rage, as investors dreamedof big rewards from the gene-splicing technology that'srevolutionizing medicine and promising treatments for suchdiseases as Alzheimer's, cancer and acquired immunedeficiency syndrome: 43 biotech IPOs raised $1.2 billion androse an average 59%.   International issues commanded a growing share of thenew-issues market as investors rushed to invest in newlyprivatized companies around the world. Hot foreign issuesincluded telephone companies in developing countries, such asTelefonos de Mexico S.A., or Telmex, which rose 72%. `It'sall part of the internationalization of equity markets,&quot; saysMr. Natale of Sandamp;P.   ---                    The Year's Biggest IPOs                                                                                                                             DOLLAR ISSUER    DATE    (in millions)  PRICE    CLOSE     CHANGE                                                                                                        MBNA           Jan. 22    $689.3     $22.50    $35.63    58.36%                                                                                                        Owens-Illinois           Dec. 11     528.0      11.00     12.00     9.09                                                                                                        Healthtrust           Dec. 12     511.0      14.00     15.25     8.93                                                                                                        Exel           July 18     487.2      25.50     37.50    47.06                                                                                                        Duracell International           May 1       365.6      15.00     34.50   130.00                                                                                                        Ambac           July 11     292.0      20.00     35.00    75.00                                                                                                        Health Care andamp; Retirement           Oct. 17     263.1      17.00     22.13    30.18                                                                                                        Destac Energy           March 14    240.0      20.00     19.75    -1.25                                                                                                        Telecom Corp. of New Zealand           July 16     237.1      22.58     28.63    26.79                                                                                                        Total S.A.
