Sesit (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> MON FRX </IN><G> FED </G><TEXT>   The U.S. government took modest action to slow the rise of the dollar. But officials indicated the move was largely symbolic and didn't reflect a commitment to stop further increases in the currency.    The U.S. intervention in currency markets occurred yesterday morning, when the Federal Reserve sold a small amount of dollars in exchange for West German marks. The move helped slow the rally that has carried the dollar sharply higher in the past week.    U.S. officials indicated that the Fed's action was intended as a show of support for the West German central bank, whose leaders fear further increases in the dollar could boost inflation in their country.    But U.S. officials remain generally satisfied with the recent rise in the dollar. At the Fed, in particular, it is seen as a sign that foreign investors are growing convinced of the central bank's determination to fight inflation. Fed officials have no intention, for now, of undertaking large-scale intervention to stop the dollar's ascent.    New York currency dealers described yesterday's intervention as modest. They said the Federal Reserve Bank of New York entered the market in the morning when the dollar was trading at a little above 1.8200 West German marks and sold several banks between $10 million and $15 million each. Traders estimated the Fed's total sales at between $200 million and $300 million, enough to move the market but not have a lasting impact.    The dollar quickly fell to about 1.8150 marks. But the head of foreign-exchange operations at one big U.S. bank said that within a short time, the U.S. currency &quot;went right back up again.&quot;    He interpreted the Fed's action as &quot;more a concern with the rate of (the dollar's) increase&quot; than its actual level. He added: &quot;They wanted to temper its rise, slow the rate of increase, not stop it.&quot;    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8218 marks, up nearly a pfennig from 1.8130 late Friday. During the afternoon in Tokyo trading Monday, the dollar reached an intraday high of 1.8300 marks.    The recent rise in the dollar has been fueled by higher interest rates in the U.S., and by improvement in the U.S. trade deficit.    The currency may also have gotten a boost from inaccurate published reports last week that the governments of the seven major industrial nations agreed at the economic summit in Toronto to accept &quot;a slight rise&quot; in the value of the dollar. In fact, the nations reached no such agreement, but merely reaffirmed an agreement reached last December.    That agreement said, in part, that a rise in the dollar would be considered &quot;counterproductive&quot; if it reached a level that governments considered &quot;destabilizing&quot; to the process of adjusting trade imbalances among their countries.    The exact level at which a rise in the dollar becomes &quot;counterproductive&quot; has never been specified in public. Despite yesterday's intervention, it appears U.S. officials are willing to see the dollar go somewhat higher.    The action yesterday focused on the dollar/mark exchange rate because the West German central bank feels especially threatened by the dollar's rise. The Bundesbank modestly increased a refinancing interest rate last week in response to the inflation threat, and there has been widespread speculation in West Germany that further rate increases may follow. </TEXT></DOC>
