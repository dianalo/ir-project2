Boone PickensJr. &quot;If he tells you a goose will pull a plow,&quot; says Mesaholder Morris Bailey, &quot;you can hook it up.&quot;   But now some major holders are losing faith, on the eve ofan important vote on Mr. Pickens's plan to convert Mesa'spartnership structure into a corporation.</LP><TEXT>   Heading into tomorrow's special meeting, several holdershave voted against the change or indicated that they plan todo so. They complain that the plan is far more generous toMr. Pickens than to holders of Mesa's partnership units.These skeptics also fear that a planned 1-for-5 reverse stocksplit could send their already battered shares into anotherdownward spiral.   &quot;We think this is a very unnecessary reorganization,&quot; saysScott Ford, assistant to the chairman at Stephens Inc., aLittle Rock, Ark., investment banking firm with just under 1%of the preferred units. Fund American Cos., which owns fivemillion common units, a 6.4% stake, also voted against theproposal, though it won't say why. Lacos Land Co., owner of750,000 preferred units, asked a Delaware chancery court tohalt the meeting; a judge rejected the request yesterday.   How is Mr. Pickens, the avowed champion of shareholderrights, handling this incipient shareholder revolt? Heinsists the deal is fair to all concerned and says he remainsconvinced that the majority of shareholders want the change.   Mesa says that roughly 70% of the common and preferredshares tallied so far have been voted for the conversion. Butapproval isn't assured: For it to pass, half of all thecommon shares outstanding and half of the preferred unitsoutstanding must be voted for the measure at tomorrow'smeeting. Mesa doesn't have that kind of turnout yet.   Mr. Pickens says a major goal of the plan is to catch WallStreet's eye so the stock will trade higher, reflectingMesa's sizable natural-gas reserves. By contrast, units tendto trade based on the yield from distributions -- but Mesahalted both common and preferred distributions about twoyears ago. Once up in the low teens, the common units now arelanguishing at 1 1/2 and the preferred at 1 3/4. Only about20% of Mesa is held by institutions; many individuals boughtit for the generally tax-free distributions.   Mesa's big challenge is to win over preferred holders, whoare owed $1.875 a unit, or about $164 million, in accrued butunpaid distributions. For each preferred unit, Mesa aims toswap 1.35 common shares of the new Mesa Inc., of which 0.35represents the unpaid dividends. Mr. Pickens says the offeris fair because Mesa probably can't resume payouts forseveral years unless the long-depressed price of natural gassoars.   A more appropriate distribution, says Mr. Ford ofStephens, would be 1.7 common shares for each preferred unit.The offer is what one might expect in a bankruptcy, he says,&quot;but Mesa's a long way short of being bankrupt.&quot;   Thomas A. Dugan, whose Farmington, N.M., oil company ownsabout 90,000 preferred units, says he's more disturbed thatthe new Mesa plans to pay Mr. Pickens a $960,000 annualsalary and grant him 800,000 stock options, twice as many ashe now has after adjusting for the reverse split. Theexercise price will be lowered to current trading prices from$6.1825. Mr. Pickens hasn't received a general partner's feesince the distributions stopped. &quot;I didn't mind paying oldBoone millions when he was doing all that fancy stuff,&quot; liketrying to acquire companies, says Mr. Dugan, &quot;but the fancydays are over.&quot;   Some holders dislike losing the tax benefits available topartners. Mr. Pickens will keep a 4.24% general-partnerinterest in the new Mesa's partnership subsidiary, giving him$2 million to $5 million in tax savings over a few years.   Mesa argues that new laws bar many individuals fromreaping many of the tax benefits that helped popularizepartnerships. It adds that Mr. Pickens must remain a generalpartner, under terms of some Mesa debt. As for salary andoptions, Mr. Pickens says that he is doing withoutacquisition-related fees and other compensation and thatrevaluing stock options &quot;isn't unusual.&quot; He says his salary,actual stock options and exercise price will be up to Mesa'snew board.   The flap might quickly fade if the stock rebounds. Butalas, says one institutional holder, stocks such as Mesa tendto fall further after a reverse split. Still, some holdersbelieve conversion is their only hope in a dismal natural-gasmarket. &quot;As long as the stock is a limited partnership, it'sdead in the water,&quot; says analyst John A. Appleby at Froley,Revy Investment in Los Angeles, who has voted for the change.   ---   Mesa L.P.
