Fractures occur in most geologic formationsand introduce a high degree of heterogeneity. Within each fracture, theaperture is not constant in value but strongly varying. Thus for suchmedia, tracer tends to flow through preferred flowpaths or channels withinthe fractures. Along each of these channels, the aperture is also stronglyvarying. A detailed analysis is carried out on a 2D single fracture withvariable apertures and the flow through channels is demonstrated. Thechannels defined this way are not rigidly set pathways for tracer transport,but are the preferred flow paths in the sense of stream-tubes in thepotential theory. It is shown that such variable-aperture channels canbe characterized by an aperture probability distribution function, andnot by the exact deterministic geometric locations. We also demonstratethat the 2D tracer transport in a fracture can be calculated by a modelof a system of 1D channels characterized by this distribution functiononly. Due to the channeling character of tracer transport in fracturedrock, random point measurements of tracer breakthrough curves may giveresults with a wide spread in value due to statistical fluctuations.The present paper suggests that such a wide spread can probably be greatlyreduced by making line/areal (or multiple) measurements covering a fewspatial correlation lengths. 13 refs., 11 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
