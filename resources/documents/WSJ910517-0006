Instead, the Denver company has been nearly wiped out. Aflood of old newspapers and aluminum cans drove down thevalue of such goods, leaving Tri-R awash in losses and unableto service its debt. In April, the company filed forprotection from its creditors under Chapter 11 of the federalBankruptcy Code. At least for now, the troubled companycontinues to operate, while working on a plan to settle withthe creditors. But its biggest investor doubts it willsurvive.</LP><TEXT>   Like many other entrepreneurs mesmerized by a rapidlygrowing market, Mr. Powelson jumped into recycling withoutthe shelter of a niche. Tri-R had a motto (&quot;Where RecyclingReally Pays&quot;), but owned no special process or technology.There was nothing especially distinctive about its service.For Mr. Powelson, success relied simply on selling reusabletrash for more than he paid for it.   But prices for recyclable waste plummeted because of amarket glut. &quot;No one I know saw it coming until it was on topof us,&quot; says the 46-year-old Mr. Powelson, Tri-R's presidentand co-founder.   Plenty of others leapt into recycling with similarlysimple strategies. These small companies failed to appreciatethat &quot;these are commodities and their prices fluctuate,&quot; saysBruce Bond, marketing director of wTe Corp., a Bedford,Mass., waste-management company. &quot;I don't think any of themare getting rich.&quot;   By contrast, some small firms are thriving because theydid understand recycling's commodity orientation -- andcarved out niches to protect themselves. For example,Horsehead Resource Development Co., Palmerton, Pa., recyclesprimarily zinc-laden dust left over from steelmaking. Insteadof dumping the dust in landfills -- a costly practice thatthe federal government plans to ban -- steel makers ship thewaste to one of Horsehead's three metal-recovery plants. Witha process that recycles 98.5% of the dust, Horsehead removesthe zinc.   By relying on the value of its recovery process tosteelmakers rather than the resale value of the commodity itcollects, Horsehead has grown robustly. Since 1988, thecompany's net income has quadrupled, to $19.8 million, on anear doubling of sales, to $54.7 million. A spokesman says anew technology that Horsehead has patented could bringfurther profitable growth, beginning next year. It wouldallow the company to recover metals at sites contaminated bycopper, zinc and lead smelters.   When Tri-R Systems went public through a $2.5 millionstock offering in July 1988, Mr. Powelson had no suchproprietary edge. But with concerns about the environmentgrowing and the nation's landfills topping out, localgovernments everywhere were requiring businesses andconsumers to sort their trash. &quot;We thought it was the righttime to expand substantially,&quot; says Mr. Powelson, who owns25% of Tri-R's stock.   During the next two years, Tri-R picked up big commercialcustomers, such as Martin Marietta Corp.'s Astronautics unitin Denver; expanded its chain of neighborhood collectioncenters to 20 from three (including eight franchised units),and opened a Phoenix, Ariz, processing plant as the hub ofits first recycling network outside Colorado. Tri-R, alongwith Laidlaw Waste Systems, a garbage-hauling unit of LaidlawTransportation Ltd. of Canada, also created a curbsideprogram to pick up and sort 35 kinds of reusable junk,including paper, aluminum, plastic, glass, copper, brass,stainless steel and silver-bearing film negatives.   Soon, though, Tri-R and many other recycling companiesrealized that they had more garbage on their hands than theycould handle. Soaring supplies of reusable trash overwhelmeddemand among manufacturers, and commodity prices tumbled. Thevalue of some kinds of paper, which accounted for more thanhalf of Tri-R's revenue, fell by half during the first halfof last year alone. (Prices since then have partiallyrecovered, and industry analysts expect further improvementas use of recycled materials picks up.)   Tri-R's aggressive expansion in the two years after goingpublic increased annual revenue 47%, to $7.8 million. But thecompany piled up $1.8 million in losses and more than tripledits debt, to $2 million.   Suddenly, Mr. Powelson was tearing down the company evenfaster than he had built it up. He slashed employment bytwo-thirds, to 45 workers, shut down all but threeneighborhood recycling centers and closed the Phoenix plant.Tri-R's role in the curbside program was turned over toanother company.   During the six months ended Jan. 31, 1991, Tri-R'sfinancial condition deteriorated further. The companyreported a net loss of $1.3 million, or 31 cents a share, onrevenue of $2.8 million. Three months later, Tri-R filed itsChapter 11 petition, in federal bankruptcy court in Denver.   Tri-R's largest shareholder doubts the company willsurvive. &quot;We've already written off the investment,&quot; saysCharles Watson, the chairman of Watson General Corp., a LaJolla, Calif., holding company that purchased a 28% stake inTri-R for $1 million less than a year ago. &quot;I don't see howthat company can be salvaged.&quot;   Kirk Sanders, a Watson General executive vice presidentwho also serves as Tri-R's chairman, says Watson would bemore upbeat about its investment if Mr. Powelson steppeddown. Mr. Powelson reacted too slowly when Tri-R's businesssoured, Mr. Sanders says. &quot;David Powelson refused or failedto make cutbacks, always betting on the come that prices weregoing to turn around,&quot; he adds.   Mr. Powelson, who has no plans to step down, says heagrees that he should have made the cutbacks sooner -- butinsists that Mr. Sanders had approved the timing of themoves. In any case, Mr. Powelson says he wants the chance toprove that his biggest investor is wrong about him. Heproposes coming out of bankruptcy court as a much smallercompany focused on high-value recyclable waste, such ascomputer paper and non-ferrous metals. He'd also like to beefup Tri-R's records-destruction business, which is unaffectedby commodity price swings.   But even if he saves the company from the scrap heap, Mr.Powelson says Tri-R's rise and fall is an experience he isunlikely to forget. He says, &quot;It's humiliating, knowing youlet a lot of people down.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
