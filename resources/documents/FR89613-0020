Overhead expenses (such as the cost of space, and heatingor lighting the facility in which the records are stored), are not includedin direct costs.``Disclose or disclosure'' means making records available, on request,for examination and copying, or furnishing a copy of records.``Duplication'' means the process of making a copy of a document necessaryto respond to an FOIA request. Among the forms that such copies can takeare, paper, microform, audiovisual materials, or machine readable documentation(e.g., magnetic tape or disk).``Records,'' ``information,'' ``document,'' and ``material'' have the samemeaning as the term ``agency records'' in section 552 of title 5, UnitedStates Code.``Review'' means the process of initially examining documents located inresponse to a request to determine whether any portion of any documentlocated may be withheld. It also includes processing documents for disclosure;e.g., doing all that is necessary to excise them and otherwise preparethem for release. Review does not include time spent resolving generallegal and policy issues regarding the application of exemptions.``Search'' means the time spent looking for material that is responsiveto a request, including page-by-page, or line-by-line identification ofmaterial within documents. The definition assumes that searches will becarried out in the most efficient and least expensive manner so as to minimizethe cost for both the agency and the requester.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.103 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Definitions of categories and assignment of requests and requestersto categories.</ITAG>OPM will apply the definitions and procedures contained in this sectionto assign requesters to categories. The four categories established by5 U.S.C. 552(a) are requests for commercial use, requests for non-commercialuse made by educational or non-commercial scientific institutions, requestsfor non-commercial use made by representatives of the news media, and allothers.(a) <T3>Request for commercial use</T3>. A ``commercial use request'' is fromor on behalf of one who seeks information for a use or purpose that furthersthe commercial, trade, or profit interests of the requester or the personor institution on whose behalf the request is made. In determining whethera request properly belongs in this category, OPM will look first to theintended use of the documents being requested.(b) <T3>Request for non-commercial use made by an educational or non-commercialscientific institution</T3>. OPM will include requesters in one of thetwo categories described in paragraphs (b) (1) and (2) of this sectionwhen the request is being made as authorized by, and under the auspicesof, a qualifying institution; and the records are sought, not for a commercialuse, but in furtherance of scholarly or scientific research.(1) ``Educational institution'' refers to any public or private, preschool,elementary, or secondary school, institution of undergraduate or graduatehigher education, or institution of professional or vocational education,which operates a program or programs of scholarly or scientific research.(2) A ``non-commercial scientific institution'' refers to an institutionthat is not operated on a ``commercial'' basis as that term is referencedin paragraph (a) of this section, and which is operated solely to conductscientific or scholarly research, the results of which are not intendedto promote any particular product or industry.(c) <T3>Request from a representative of the news media</T3>. ``Representativeof the news media'' refers to any person actively gathering news for anentity that is organized and operated to publish, broadcast, or otherwisedisseminate news to the public. The term ``news'' means information thatis about current events or that would be of current interest to the public.Examples of news media entities include television or radio stations broadcastingto the public at large, and publishers of periodicals who make their productsavailable for purchase or subscription by the general public. Free-lancejournalists may be regarded as representatives of the news media if theydemonstrate a solid basis for expecting publication, or some other formof dissemination, through a particular organization even though they arenot actually employed by it. OPM will assign news media officials to thiscategory only when a request is not for commercial use. If a person meetsthe other qualifications for inclusion, OPM will not apply the term ``commercialuse'' to his or her request for records in support of a news disseminationfunction.(d) <T3>Requests from others</T3>. The category ``all others,'' consists ofany requesters not covered by paragraph (a), (b), or (c) of this section.However, as provided by andSection; 294.105, OPM will use its Privacy Actregulations, rather than this subpart, when individuals ask for recordsabout themselves that may be filed in OPM systems of records.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.104 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Clarifying a requester's category.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Seeking clarification of a requester's category</T3>. OPM may seekadditional clarification before assigning a person to a specific categoryif_(1) There is reasonable cause to doubt the requester's intended use ofrecords; or(2) The intended use is not clear from the request itself; or(3) There is any other reasonable doubt qualifications that may affectthe fees applicable or the services rendered under andSection; 294.109 ofthis part.(b) <T3>Prompt notification to requester. </T3>When OPM seeks clarificationas provided by paragraph (a) of this section, it will provide prompt notificationeither by telephone or in writing of the information or materials needed.(c) <T3>Effect of seeking clarification on time limits for responding. </T3>Whenapplying the time limits in section 552 of title 5, United States Code,OPM will not officially consider any request for records as being receiveduntil the official who is assigned responsibility for making a decisionon releasing the records has_(1) Received any additional clarification sought under paragraphs (a) and(b) of this section; and(2) Determined that the clarifying information is sufficient to correctlyplace the requester in one of the categories prescribed in this section.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.105 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Access to the requester's own records.</ITAG>When the subject of a record, or a duly authorized representative of thesubject, requests his or her own records from a Privacy Act system of records,as defined by 5 U.S.C. 552a(a)(5), and the record is maintained so thatit is retrieved by the subject's name or other personal identifier, OPMwill process the request under the Privacy Act procedures in Part 297 ofthis chapter.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.106 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Index of information.</ITAG>(a) (1) OPM publishes OPM Document No. 1, ``Index to Information'' annuallyand issues supplements during the year when there is a sufficient volumeof new or revised material. This index contains material published andoffered for sale or available for public inspection and copying. Unlessthe material is published and offered for sale, OPM generally makes availablefor public inspection and copying:(i) Final opinions made by OPM in the adjudication of cases, which arerelied on and cited by the OPM as precedent;(ii) OPM policy statements and interpretations adopted by OPM but not publishedin the <T4>Federal Register</T4>; and(iii) OPM administrative staff manuals and instructions that affect a memberof the public.(2) OPM may not make available material (or portions of material) whererelease would constitute a clearly unwarranted invasion of personal privacy;or where the material is exempt from disclosure under the provisions of5 U.S.C. 552(b); or where release is not in accordance with OPM regulations,administrative staff manuals or instructions, referenced in Subpart D of5 CFR Part 294.(b) A copy of this index is available at no cost from the Internal DistributionSubunit, Office of Personnel Management, Room B443, 1900 E Street NW.,Washington, DC 20415.(c) OPM indexes material for the convenience of the public. Indexing doesnot constitute a determination that all of the material listed is withinthe category that is required to be indexed by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2). Mostof OPM's publications may be found in OPM's Library in Room 5H27 at theaddress listed in paragraph (b) of this section.(d) As provided by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(2), OPM has determined that it is unnecessaryand impractical to publish the ``Index to Information'' more frequentlythan annually because of the small number of revisions that occur.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.107 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Places to obtain records.</ITAG>(a) Address requests for OPM records to the officials listed in paragraph(b), (c), or (d) of this section.(b) The following is a list of key Washington, DC officials of OPM andtheir principal areas of responsibility.

If aperson has asked to be kept apprised of anything that will delay the officialreceipt of a request, OPM will provide notice of this forwarding action.Otherwise, OPM may, at its option, provide such notice.(f) <T3>Applying the time limits.</T3> When applying the time limits in section552 of title 5, United States Code, OPM will not officially consider anyrequest to be received until it arrives in the OPM organization that hasresponsibility for the records sought.(g) <T3>Records from other Government agencies.</T3> When a person seeks recordsthat originated in another Government agency, OPM may refer the requestto the other agency for response. Ordinarily, OPM will provide notice ofthis type of referral.(h) <T3>Creating records.</T3> If a person seeks information from OPM in aformat that does not currently exist, OPM will not ordinarily compile theinformation for the purpose of creating a record to respond to the request.OPM will advise the individual that it does not have records in the formatsought. If other existing records would reasonably respond to the requestor portions of it, OPM may provide these. If fees as provided in andSection;294.109of this part apply to any alternative records, OPM will advise the requesterbefore providing the records.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;294.108</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Procedures for obtaining records.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Mailing or delivering a request.</T3> Any person may ask for recordsunder section 552 of title 5, United States Code, by directing a letterto one of the organizations listed in andSection;294.107 of this part, orby deliverying a request in person at the addresses listed in that sectionduring business hours on a regular business day.(b) <T3>Proper marking.</T3> Each request for records should have a clear andprominent notation on the first page, such as ``Freedom of InformationAct Request.'' In addition, if sent by mail or otherwise submitted in anenvelope or other cover, mark the outside clearly and prominently with``FOIA Request'' or ``Freedom of Information Act Request.''(c) <T3>Contents of request letter.</T3> A request must describe the recordssought in sufficient detail to enable OPM personnel to locate the recordswith a reasonable amount of effort.(1) OPM will regard a request for a specific category of records as fulfillingthe requirements of this paragraph, if it enables responsive records tobe identified by a technique or process that is not unreasonably burdensomeor disruptive to OPM operations.(2) Whenever possible, a request should include specific information abouteach record sought, such as the date, number, title or name, author, recipient,and subject matter of the record.(3) If an OPM organization determines that a request does not reasonablydescribe the records sought, it will either provide notice of any additionalinformation needed or otherwise state why the request is insufficient.OPM will also offer the record seeker an opportunity to confer, with theobjective of reformulating the request so that it meets the requirementsof this section.(d) <T3>Medical records.</T3> OPM or another Government agency may disclosethe medical records of an applicant, employee, or annuitant to the subjectof the record, or to a representative designated in writing. However, medicalrecords may contain information about an individual's mental or physicalcondition that a prudent physician would hesitate to give to the individual.Under such circumstances, OPM may disclose the records, including the exactnature and probable outcome of the condition, only to licensed physiciandesignated in writing for that purpose by the individual or his or herdesignated representative.(e) <T3>Publications.</T3> If the subject matter of a request includes materialpublished and offered for sale (e.g., by the Superintendent of Documents,Government Printing Office), OPM will explain where a person may reviewand/or purchase the publications.(f) <T3>Responses within 10 working days. </T3>Except in unusual circumstances(as defined in 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(6)(B)), OPM will determine whether to discloseor deny records within 10-working days after receipt of the request (excludingweekends and holidays) and will provide notice immediately of its determinationand the fees required, if any, as prescribed by andSection; 294.109 of thispart.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 294.109</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Fees.</ITAG>(a) <T3>Applicability of fees. </T3>OPM entities will furnish, without charge,reasonable quantities of material that they have available for free distributionto the public. Subject to payment of fees as specified in this section,OPM may furnish other material. These fees are intended to recoup the fullallowable direct costs of providing services.(b) <T3>Payment of fees. </T3>Individuals may pay fees by check or money order,payable to the Office of Personnel Management.(1) OPM will not assess fees for individual requests if the total chargewould be less than $25, except as provided in paragraph (b)(5) of thissection.(2) If a request may reasonably result in a fee assessment of more than$25, OPM will not release records unless the requester agrees to pay theanticipated charges.(3) If the request does not include an acceptable agreement to pay feesand does not otherwise convey a willingness to pay fees, OPM will promptlyprovide notification of the estimated fees. This notice will offer an opportunityto confer with OPM staff to reformulate the request to meet the requester'sneeds at a lower cost. Upon agreement to pay the required fees, OPM willfurther process the request.(4) As described in andSection; 294.107 of this part, OPM ordinarily respondsto Freedom of Information Act requests in a decentralized manner. Becauseof this, OPM may at times refer a single request to two or more OPM entitiesto make separate direct responses. In such cases, each responding entitymay assess fees as provided by this section, but only for direct costsassociated with any response the component has prepared.(5) OPM may aggregate requests and charge fees accordingly, when thereis a reasonable belief that a requester, or a group of requesters actingin concert, is attempting to break a request down into a series of requeststo evade the assessment of fees.(i) If multiple requests of this type occur within a 30-day period, OPMmay provide notice that it is aggregating the requests and that it willapply the fee provisions of this section, including any required agreementto pay fees and any advice payment.(ii) Before aggregating requests of this type made over a period longerthan 30 days, OPM will assure that it has a solid basis on which to concludethat the requesters are acting in concert and are acting specifically toavoid payment of fees.(iii) OPM will not aggregate multiple requests on unrelated subjects fromone person.(6) If fees for document search are authorized as provided in paragraph(f) of this section, OPM may assess charges for an employee's (or employees')time spent searching for documents and other direct costs of a search,even if a search fails to locate records or if records located are determinedto exempt from disclosure.(7) Services requested and performed but not required under the Freedomof Information Act, such as formal certification of records as true copies,will be subject to charges under the Federal User Charge Statute (31 U.S.C.483a) or other applicable statutes.(c) <T3>Payment of fees in advance. </T3>If OPM estimates or determines thatfees are likely to exceed $250, OPM may require the payment of applicablefees in advance.(1) If an OPM official, who is authorized to make a decision on a particularrequest, determines that the requester has a history of prompt paymentof FOIA fees, OPM will provide notice of the likely cost and obtain satisfactoryassurances of full payment.(2) When a person, or an organization that a person represents, has previouslyfailed to pay any fee charged in a timely manner, OPM will require fullpayment of all fees in advance. In this section, an untimely payment isconsidered to be a payment that is not made within 30 days of the billingdate.(3) If a person, or an organization that a person represents, has not paidfees previously assessed, OPM will not begin to process any new requestfor records, until that individual has paid the full amount owed plus anyapplicable interest, and made a full advance payment for the new request.(4) If a request, which requires the advance payment of fees under thecriteria specified in this section, is not accompanied by the requiredpayment, OPM will promptly notify the requester that he or she must paythe required fee within 30 days and that OPM will not further process therequest until it receives payment.(5) OPM may begin assessing interest charges on an unpaid bill startingon the 31st day following the date on which the bill was sent. Interestwill be at the rate prescribed in 31 U.S.C. 3717 and will accrue from thedate of the billing.(6) To encourage the repayment of debts incurred under this subpart, OPMmay use the procedures authorized by Pub. L. 97-365, the Debt CollectonAct of 1982. This may include disclosure to consumer reporting agenciesand the use of collection agencies.(d) <T3>Waiver of fees.</T3> OPM will furnish documents under this subpartwithout any charge, or at a reduced charge, if disclosure of the informationis in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantlyto public understanding of the operations or activities of the Government,and it is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester.(1) In determining whether disclosure is in the public interest becauseit is likely to contribute significantly to public understanding of theoperations or activities of the Government, OPM shall consider the followingfactors:(i) The subject of the request: Whether the subject of the requested recordsconcerns ``the operations or activities of the Government'';(ii) The informative value of the information to be disclosed: Whetherthe disclosure is ``likely to contribute'' to an understanding of Governmentoperations or activities;(iii) The contribution to an understanding of the subject by the generalpublic likely to result from disclosure: Whether disclosure of the requrestedinformation will contribute to ``public understanding''; and(iv) The significance of the contribution to public understanding; Whetherthe disclosure is likely to contribute ``significantly'' to public understandingof Government operations or activities.(2) In determining whether disclosure of the information is not primarilyin the commercial interest of the requester, OPM will consider the followingfactors:(i) <T3>The existence and magnitude of a commercial interest.</T3> Whetherthe requester has a commercial interest that would be furthered by therequested disclosure; and if so(ii) <T3>The primary interest in disclosure.</T3> Whether the magnitude of theidentified commercial interest of the requester is sufficiently large,in comparison with the public interest in disclosure, that disclosure is``primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. ''(3) An OPM official may deny a waiver of fees or a request for a reducedfee without further consideration if the request does not include the followinginformation:(i) A clear statement of the requester's interest in the document(s);(ii) The use proposed for the documents and whether the requester willderive income or other benefit from such use:(iii) A statement of how the public will benefit from OPM's release ofthe requested documents; and(iv) If specialized use of the documents is contemplated, a statement ofthe requester's qualifications that are relevant to the specialized use.(4) In all cases the burden of proof shall be on the requester to presentevidence or information in support of a request for a waiver or reductionof fees.(5) A requester may appeal the denial of a waiver request as provided byandSection; 294.110 of this part.(e) <T3>Rates used to compute fees.</T3> The following rates form the basisfor assessing reasonable, standard charges for document search, duplication,and review as required by 5 U.S.C. 552(a)(4). The listing of rates belowshould be used in conjunction with the fee components listed in paragraph(f) of this section, the first-100-pages of paper copies exception in paragraph(g) of this section, and the first-2-hours manual records search exceptionin paragraph (h) of this section.<ITAG tagnum="110"><C>2,L0,tp0,p0,8/9,g1,t1,i1,s50,r50</C> <H1> </H1><H1> </H1><ITAG tagnum="1">Employee time<D>Salary rate plus 16 percent to cover benefits.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Photocopies (up to 8\1/2\andmin16;andmin16;x14andmin16;andmin16;<D>$0.13 a page.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Printed materials, per 25 pages or fraction thereof<D>$0.25.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Computer time<D>Actual direct cost.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Supplies and other material<D>Actual direct cost.</D></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="1">Other costs not identified above<D>Actual direct cost.</D></ITAG></ITAG>(f) <T3>Fee components by category of user. </T3>For the purpose of assessingfees under this section, requests may have three cost components. Theseare the cost of document search, the cost of duplication, and the costof review. When computing the fee applicable to a request, OPM will applythe rates in paragraph (e) of this section to the cost components thatapply to the requester's category. Cost components apply to categoriesof requesters as follows.(1) A commercial use requester_Pays actual direct costs for document search,duplication, and review.(2) A requester from an educational and non-commerical scientific instititionand a representative of the news media_Pays actual direct costs for documentduplication when records are not sought for commercial use.
