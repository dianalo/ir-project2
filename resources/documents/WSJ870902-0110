The former American president deserves a small share of the credit for the Italian domino that didn't fall, the Communist takeover that didn't happen. It is particularly worth recalling this history now that the Iran-Contra hearings have shown how excessive resort to covert operations has displaced professional diplomacy as an instrument for promoting U.S. foreign-policy goals.    When President Carter was elected in November 1976, Italy was, as the national security adviser at the time, Zbigniew Brzezinski, warned in a memorandum, &quot;potentially the greatest political problem we now have in Europe.&quot; In the last months of the Ford administration, the Communists achieved a record high in an Italian election, 34.4% of the vote. They were extending their hegemony in every important area of Italian life -- the schools, the press, the judiciary, the trade unions, regional and local government.    It seemed inevitable that they would soon enter the government in a &quot;historic compromise&quot; coalition with the Christian Democrats, eventually destroying both Italian freedom and the country's support of the Western alliance.    In this crisis atmosphere, the Carter administration was pressured with bad advice from the two extremes of the American political spectrum. From the right came demands for the U.S. to take a direct role in stopping the Communist threat, through covert operations if necessary. The president, supported by Mr. Brzezinski and Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, rejected that option. In a presidential decision paper of March 14, 1977, he ruled out the financing of Italian political parties, the manipulation of Italian political events, and trying to dictate to the Italians how they should vote.    The other bit of bad advice came from a small group of academic specialists in Italy, centered at Harvard and Yale, who argued that the accession to power of the Communist Party (known as the PCI) was both inevitable and desirable. The inevitability was &quot;proved,&quot; they argued, by the fact that in all recent elections the PCI had won more than its share of the youth vote. They &quot;proved&quot; the desirability of PCI entry into government with the argument that worker peace and control of terrorism could be obtained only by giving the Communists a share of power. Of course, Benito Mussolini had used a similar argument, and it cost Italians their freedom.    President Carter rejected this advice as well. In the same March 1977 memorandum, he determined that the U.S. should make clear privately to Italian leaders and publicly to the Italian people that while the U.S. would not interfere with the Italians' right to choose their leaders, it would exercise its right to express a preference that Communist parties not participate in Western governments. This was stated plainly in public six times between April and December 1977.    During these difficult months, the American Embassy in Rome, where I was ambassador, launched a major effort to win the confidence of Bettino Craxi and other leaders of the Italian Socialist Party. The Socialist Party was beginning to chart a new course, terminating its alliance with the Communists and later joining in governments with the Christian Democrats and the small centrist parties. We also cultivated leaders of the non-Communist left who had previously been neglected.    When we learned in December that some Christian Democratic leaders were contemplating bringing the PCI into the government, we urgently asked President Carter to authorize a stronger statement of our foreign-policy preferences. I was summoned to Washington and after I met with the president and National Security Council, the State Department issued a declaration on Jan. 12, 1978, saying, &quot;We do not favor such {Communist} participation and would like to see Communist influence in any Western European country reduced.&quot;    After this statement, plans to share power with the Communists were dropped. In the 1979 elections, the PCI suffered its first postwar electoral setback, its share of the vote slipping to 30.4%. The party has been on the downhill slope ever since.    The main credit for Italy's recent political stability belongs to the Italian people, of course, but that almost-forgotten man in Plains, Ga., deserves at least an honorable mention.    ---   Mr. Gardner, professor of law at Columbia, served as U.S. ambassador to Italy from 1977 to 1981. </TEXT></DOC>
