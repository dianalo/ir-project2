The authors' latest model represents a significantimprovement over our previous ones in the following aspects: (1) TheU-arm gantry containing the x-ray tube and detector assembly is movedduring the scanning and the patient therefore does not move. (2) Thedigital images can be taken with the patient standing. (3) The fieldof view has been increased to include the entire chest. (4) The matrixsize has been greatly expanded. (5) A newly developed rare earth phosphorscreen with much higher resolution and good absorption is used. The imagesare digitally processed, resulting in a balanced image in which structuresin all regions of the chest are simultaneously displayed with optimumcontrast.</TEXT></DOC>
