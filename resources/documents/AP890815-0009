LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Six months after the Soviet militarywithdrawal, President Najib remains in power, the U.S.-backedguerrillas who oppose him are feuding and both superpowers areincreasing arms deliveries.   The United States and Soviet Union have said they want apolitical settlement of the 11-year-old civil war, but talks inStockholm two weeks ago produced no breakthrough and summer fightinghas continued.   When the last Soviet troops crossed the Oxus River border Feb.15, journalists in Kabul awaited the imminent arrival of the Moslemguerrillas, as predicted by Western diplomats who had closed theirembassies and left.   Six months later, with Najib in office and his communistgovernment denying rumors of an attempted coup in July, there is noexpectation of guerrillas capturing Kabul or any key provincialcapital.   Western embassies remain closed, however. Soviet bloc and Asiandiplomats in Kabul say that is more indicative of U.S. opposition toreaching a deal with Najib than to fear of the rockets that fall onthe city almost daily.   Foreign Ministry spokesman Mohammad Nabi Amani said Monday thatNajib, who uses only one name, has proved his government can defenditself and is not the kind of Soviet ``puppet'' the United Statesexpected to fall.   Najib has offered to hold elections, under U.N. supervision, fora broad-based coalition government but insists his partyparticipate. The guerrillas reject that participation.   ``We want a political settlement,'' Amani said. ``War bringsnothing but the killing of innocent civilians and furtherdestruction of our country. The war option cannot solve anything.''   Rockets are a daily threat in this mile-high capital ringed bymountains. Some unofficial estimates say they hit civilian targets98 percent of the time and military targets only 2 percent.   U.N. sources said 281 people were killed and 745 wounded, nearlyall civilians, by rockets and a car bombing between June 25 and Aug.1.   Residents generally blame the rockets on the guerrillas and onthe United States, which pays for them, but more and more they alsoare holding the government and Soviets responsible.   ``Both sides buy rockets and we hate both of them,'' said Salah,an 18-year-old student, as he walked through rubble that had been afriend's home.   ``I think now it's time the great powers, the Soviet Union andthe United States, must accept some type of solution forAfghanistann'' said Esmatee Wardak, president of the Women'sCommittee.   Washington and Moscow agreed to act as guarantors of theU.N.-mediated accords of April 1988 between Afghanistan andneighboring Pakistan, which provided for withdrawal of Sovietsoldiers and an end to outside involvement.   Moslem guerrillas began fighting after a communist coup in April1978 and Soviet forces entered the country in December 1979.   Each side has accused the other of interfering. The United Statessays the Soviet Union is shipping arms to Najib's government at therate of $2.5 billion to $3 billion a year, nearly double the figurebefore the withdrawal.   The United States has promised the guerrillas new weapons withwhich to disable airport runways and counter high-altitude bombingby the Afghan air force.   Lt. Gen. Abdul Haq Ulumi of the Afghan supreme military councilsaid last week the Soviets were supplying with new MiG-29 fightersand the latest Sukhoi-27 ground attack jets to defend against apossible Pakistani attack.   At least 3 million Afghans have fled to Pakistan, Afghanistan'seastern neighbor, which Najib's government accuses of directinvolvement in the war. Guerrillas use border cities and refugeecamps as bases and supply points.   Peter Tomsen, a U.S. envoy to the guerrillas appointed byPresident Bush, predicted a major guerrilla offensive during thefighting season, which lasts until November, but it has notmaterialiized.   ``The end is clear,'' he told a congressional committee lastmonth. ``Resistance will prevail.''   Tomsen said little of the guerrillas' failure to capture theprovincial capital of Jalalabad after months of siege, and an attackJuly 9 by one of the seven guerrilla groups based in Pakistan onanother.   Members of the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar's group Hezb-i-Islami, whichhas received the most U.S. aid, were reported to have killed 30field commanders and fighters of the rival Jamiat-i-Islami.   Compounding the effections of factionalism has been thereluctance of some field commanders to fight. Some say they resentnot being included in the exile government formed earlier this yearand are unwilling to risk their men for it.   Najib has emphasized national reconciliation, offering autonomyto local commanders who make peace will him.   On Monday, he met with 60 former guerrillas who came over to thegovernment and said: ``Those who were fighting come together, justlike two brothers beside each other.''   The government has yet to win over any major guerrilla commanders.   Amani, the Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Monday the securitybelt around Kabul was being extended to prevent long-range rocketsfrom reaching the city.   He said the zone, now about 20 miles, would be enlarged tobetween 25 miles and 40 miles, depending on terrain. Amani said thegovernment expected the guerrillas to start using long-ranterockets. Those now in use have ranges of 20 miles or less.</TEXT></DOC>
