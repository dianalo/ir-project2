Ricks (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><IN> STK SCR </IN><G> CNG SEC </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A General Accounting Office study of efforts to combat insider trading concludes that Congress may eventually be forced to define that crime.    &quot;It is unclear . . . how the courts will rule in future insider trading cases&quot; when &quot;defendants may claim that the laws aren't sufficiently clear to justify criminal sanctions,&quot; the GAO said. &quot;Because of this, it may become necessary for Congress to amend the securities laws to show more clearly what behavior constitutes insider trading.&quot;    The GAO study was requested by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), the leading congressional opponent of defining insider trading. A spokesman for Rep. Dingell didn't have any immediate comment on that aspect of the GAO study, but said the lawmaker continues to believe that any definition would contain exploitable loopholes.    The spokesman indicated that Rep. Dingell is more interested in the report's findings about the difficulties the Securities and Exchange Commission encounters in pursuing insider trading by offshore accounts. As reported earlier this year, the GAO found that more than one-third of all cases of suspected insider trading referred to the SEC by stock exchanges in 1986 and 1987 involved foreign brokerage firms. Rep. Dingell is expected to hold investigative hearings on foreign-based insider trading within a few months.    In a prepared statement, Rep. Dingell also said that the report underscores the SEC's need for additional resources. &quot;That's an issue I plan to address early in the next Congress,&quot; he said. He has suggested in the past that the agency be allowed to keep for its own use a greater amount of the fees and fines it collects.    The report also makes several less controversial recommendations, including offering bounties to informers, speeding the exchanges' referrals about suspicious trading to the SEC, and authorizing the SEC to withhold from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act information obtained from foreign officials. Those suggestions already have been acted upon by the SEC or incorporated into pending legislation. </TEXT></DOC>
