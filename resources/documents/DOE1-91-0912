The active enzyme is a dimercomposed of identical subunits of M/sub r/ = 53,000. Antisera raisedto enzyme purified from rats fed a diet containing cholestyramine andmevinolin precipitated HMG-CoA synthase. The antibody precipitated apolypeptide of M/sub r/ = 53,000 after NaDodSO{sub 4} gel electrophoresisfrom rat hepatocytes that had been previously incubated with [{sup 35}S]methionine. The rates of synthesis and degradation of HMG-CoA synthasewere determined by immunoprecipitation of the enzyme from hepatocyteswhich were labeled with [{sup 35}S] methionine during pulse and pulse-chaseexperiments. In hepatocytes isolated from the livers of rats fed eithera diet containing cholesterol, a control diet, or a diet containing cholestyramineplus/minus mevinolin, the relative rates of synthase synthesis were 0.12%,0.20%, 0.30%, and 0.43% respectively, of the rates of total cellularprotein synthesis.</TEXT></DOC>
