Ownership in the new company, Sprint Networks USSR, issplit evenly between Sprint and Central Telegraph of theSoviet Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications. The ventureplans to begin operating a switching center by the fourthquarter in Moscow to provide high-speed data communicationsservices, domestically and internationally.</LP><TEXT>   The agreement would broaden European penetration bySprint, which has built many of Western Europe's public-datanetworks and which has been trying to strengthen its presencein overseas markets against the overwhelming dominance ofAmerican Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. Moreover, many of Sprint'spotential corporate customers are U.S.-based companies thatare locating businesses in Moscow and are demanding moredata-communications services.   The joint venture still needs approval from the U.S.Department of Commerce and the Paris-based CoordinatingCommittee for Multilateral Export Controls (Cocom). While theU.S. government has expressed a willingness to increaseexports of sophisticated telecommunications equipment to theSoviet Union and Eastern Europe, it recently shot down a planby a consortium led by US West Inc., the Denver-based Bellregional phone company, to build a giant fiber-opticcommunications network linking the Soviet Union with Europeand Asia.   Sprint, a unit of United Telecommunications Inc., filedapplications for licenses to export its technology lastMarch, when it announced it was holding discussions with theSoviets. Susan Williams, Sprint's vice president ofinternational business development, said Sprint is confidentthat its export requests will be approved.   &quot;Our applications for export are going well, and we stillexpect service to begin in the fourth quarter {of thisyear},&quot; she said. &quot;Everything is ahead of schedule.&quot;   Sprint said the venture will link Soviet governmentcustomers and the diplomatic corps in Moscow to the SprintNetinternational data network, which ties databases and onlineservices in the U.S. and throughout the world. Thesecustomers also will be able to get Sprint's Sprintmailelectronic mail service.   &quot;The goal is to offer all data communications services toresidential customers in Moscow that our customers inCincinnati and Miami can get today,&quot; said Ms. Williams.Eventually service will be extended to other parts of thecountry as the Soviet Union upgrades its telephoneinfrastructure. Overseas links will be provided viasatellite, she said.   A major portion of the agreement is potential futureorders for Sprint's Telenet data communications equipment.Sprint added that installing Telenet transmission equipmenton customer sites in the country will end up &quot;forming thebackbone of the Soviet Union's first data communicationsnetwork.&quot;   &quot;The joint venture is a landmark in the development of theU.S.S.R.'s data communications capability, joining our telexsystems with new technologies that will serve our country'sneeds, and those of foreign interests based here, well intothe 21st century,&quot; said Viacheslav Rubtsov, general managerof Central Telegraph.   The new company will be headed initially by SprintInternational's director of business planning anddevelopment, Henry Radzikowski, while deputy managingdirector will be Viktor Toor, who is currently thesecond-ranked manager at Central Telegraph. The remainingstaff of 30 employees will be made up mostly of Sovietnationals, said Ms. Williams.   In New York Stock Exchange composite trading yesterday,United Telecommunications stock closed at $40, up 37.5 cents.</TEXT></DOC>
