With the countdown to tonight's United Nations deadlinefor Iraq to pull out of Kuwait now down to hours rather thandays, there was a surge of buying in oil markets. The reasonwas &quot;a heightened fear of war, given developments over theweekend,&quot; said Ann-Louise Hittle, a senior oil analyst forShearson Lehman Brothers.</LP><TEXT>   Among the developments was the failure of U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to persuade SaddamHussein to withdraw his troops from Kuwait. Analysts alsocited reports that Iraq's national assembly voted unanimouslyyesterday to support Saddam Hussein's tough stand on Kuwait.   Futures prices shot up in both Europe and the U.S. asmarkets opened. They closed much higher despite profit-takinglater in the day. On the International Petroleum Exchange inLondon, where margins were increased 25% in view of potentialvolatility if hostilities break out in the Middle East, Brentcrude for February delivery closed up $3.50 a barrel at$29.17.   In U.S. futures trading, the February crude again brokethrough the psychologically important level of $30 a barrel,reaching an intraday high of $32. It settled at $30.78, up$3.49 a barrel.   Futures prices for fuels also rocketed up on the New YorkMercantile Exchange. February heating oil was up 11.62 centsa gallon to 88.98 cents, and February gasoline rose 9.38cents a gallon to 82.26 cents.   In the cash market, crude and product prices trackedfutures prices. Also, refiners increased field postings --the prices they pay directly to producers -- for West TexasIntermediate, the U.S. benchmark crude, by $3.50 a barrel to$29.50.   &quot;A lot of people hadn't taken the war threat seriously&quot;until yesterday, &quot;in hopes that something would be worked outat the 11th hour,&quot; said Peter Beutel, director of the energygroup at Pegasus Econometric.   At least one energy futures broker still expects somethingto be worked out in the Persian Gulf crisis, however.Shahrokh Nikkhah, senior vice president, futures investments,at Prudential-Bache Securities, suggested Saddam Hussein willyet negotiate himself out of his sticky position in Kuwait.   &quot;He will come up with a proposition no one can refuse,&quot;said Mr. Nikkhah. &quot;We could be looking at $22 crude&quot; by thisafternoon, he added.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Gold jumped as weekend attempts failed toresolve the Gulf dispute peacefully. February gold finishedat $401.60 an ounce, up $8.30. Silver was &quot;tagging along withgold,&quot; according to William O'Neill, futures analyst atMerrill Lynch in New York; the March silver contract ended at$4.257 an ounce, up 8.2 cents. April platinum eased 90 centsto $421.70 an ounce. Since Aug. 3, the day after Iraq invadedKuwait, gold has risen about $11 an ounce while silver andplatinum prices have dropped roughly 15%, Mr. O'Neill said.&quot;On a relative basis, gold is now reflecting a war premium,&quot;Mr. O'Neill said. He is pessimistic that any of the metalscould rally from current levels. &quot;Of course, we could have asharp spike up when and if the missiles start to fly, buteven under a worst-scenario situation I can't see goldexceeding $440,&quot; he said. Mr. O'Neill noted that there hasbeen steady selling by Australian producers with someadditional producer selling -- possibly South African orSoviet -- in European markets. But selling by neither dealersnor speculators has been aggressive, he added. &quot;Based on thevolume we have seen on {New York's} Comex the interest ingold is good, but far from overwhelming,&quot; he said.                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Corn futures prices rose on agovernment report showing record domestic feed use, but wheatand soybean futures prices declined as traders sold off longpositions. A U.S. Agriculture Department report releasedFriday showed the highest-ever use of corn as feed forlivestock during the last quarter, prompting widespreadbuying of corn futures yesterday. The corn contract for Marchdelivery rose 2 3/4 cents to $2.335 a bushel. The Marchsoybean contract, however, fell 2 1/2 cents to $5.925 abushel, its lowest price since fall 1989. Analysts saidprospects were dim for relief from the steady decline insoybeans, with anemic export demand exerting continuingdownward pressure on prices. The March wheat futures contractdeclined 3 3/4 cents to $2.4875 a bushel but is expected torise at the opening of trading today on a positive governmentreport released after trading yesterday. The USDA announcedan export bonus of 1.2 million metric tons of wheat to thePhilippines.                                                                                                          ORANGE JUICE: Futures prices rallied following Friday'sU.S. Agriculture Department crop report. The March contractgained 4.80 cents a pound to $1.1895. The crop report, basedon Jan. 1 conditions, showed the Florida crop declining byfour million 90-pound boxes from the December estimate, to161 million boxes. More important, said Celeste Georgakis,orange juice analyst at Cargill Investors Services in NewYork, was that the juice yield was reduced to 1.48 gallons abox from 1.50 gallons. The California crop was estimated at25 million boxes, down from the December estimate of 63million boxes. That reduction, due to a cold snap inCalifornia, wasn't a surprise, Ms. Georgakis said. &quot;Ofcourse, the small crop from California will have to bereplaced with fruit from elsewhere -- either Florida orIsrael,&quot; she noted. The California crop mainly goes to thefresh fruit market and not toward producing orange juice. Thelatest crop report encouraged people in the orange juicetrade in thinking prices can be kept above $1 a pound Ms.Georgakis said. Another factor buoying the market is thebelief of some producers and processors that the Braziliancrop will come in at around 220 million boxes instead of theearlier estimate of 290 million to 300 million. But &quot;theindustry is not ready to believe these lower numbers yet,&quot;Ms. Georgakis cautioned.                                                                                                          COPPER: Futures prices continued to weaken on worries thata war would worsen a recession. The March contract ended 2.25cents lower at $1.106 a pound. Bernard Savaiko, senior metalsanalyst at PaineWebber in New York, said traders thought warwould hurt the economy by causing consumers to postponepurchases of consumer goods that include copper, such asappliances and automobiles. However, he noted that becausecopper is &quot;a metal of war,&quot; used in armaments and munitions,industrial demand could rise in an extended conflict.Profit-taking following copper's recent rally alsocontributed to the decline. John E. Gross, president of J.E.Gross andamp; Associates, consultants to the metals industry, notedthat some investors who bought during the recent technicalrally have been selling positions in the past week after afollow-through failed to materialize. The March contract roseto a high of $1.197 on Jan. 2 and since then has beengenerally weakening.</TEXT></DOC>
