Petroleum product futures market permitbuyers to use that leverage more effectively. During periods of surplusmarkets, declines in product prices back into crude oil markets veryrapidly. That is, as buyers of petroleum products throughout the distributionchain bid on product prices, the refiner must either cut back his refineryruns until the product surplus disappears or seek lower crude oil pricesfrom his suppliers. The refiner will take both of these actions to varyingdegrees today, but with the advent of futures trading, a declining productfutures price gives an important early warning signal to crude oil suppliers.These crude oil producers, private oil companies and OPEC national oilcompanies alike, must then react by either reducing crude oil productionor decreasing crude oil prices. Each seller must react faster and toa greater degree than under the previous system, thereby generating thepotential for more competition among crude oil suppliers. Since the historyof the petroleum industry has been one of surplus, and in all likelihoodthat surplus is likely to continue, the futures market represents animportant mechanism by which that surplus is visibly and rapidly translatedinto lower product prices.</TEXT></DOC>
