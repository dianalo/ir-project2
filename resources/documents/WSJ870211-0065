In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group said it holds 925,100 Computer Memories common shares, including 181,600 purchased from Jan. 26 through last Friday for $2.25 to $2.375 each.    The group includes Far Hills, N.J.-based Sun Equities Corp. and its chairman, Paul O. Koether; Emerald Partners, and Sussex Group Inc.    Last Saturday, at the request of management, Mr. Koether sent a letter to Irwin Rubin, Computer Memories president, outlining the group's plans for the company if it obtains control, the filing said. The letter said the group plans to use the company's assets to buy another business.    The group added that it hasn't approached a particular company about an acquisition, but has identified potential candidates in several industries, including natural gas, environmental services, office supplies, and record storage and retrieval.    According to the filing, Computer Memories' board is scheduled to meet Friday to consider the company's direction. Officials of the Chatsworth, Calif.-based maker of disk drives weren't available for comment. </TEXT></DOC>
