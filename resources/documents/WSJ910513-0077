The verticaltorrent of water splashes and sprays as it descends overmoss-covered rocky shelves. Eventually it mellows into aquiet pool where catfish and bass lazily swim amid the fallentrees and boulders.   Turning to leave, your eyes focus on the slow, hypnoticalmovement of a water wheel as it's methodically turned by atrickle of water. Below the wheel a pair of alligators snoozeat the side of the stream.</LP><TEXT>   It is a classic outdoor scene . . . but it's indoors, andthe waterfall and water wheel are but two of the manyattractions within this mall-sized building. A stroll takesyou past aquariums totaling 130,000 gallons of fresh andsaltwater. Behind the walls of glass, visitors watch some ofthe largest sport fish in captivity swimming withinenvironments painstakingly sculpted to copy natural habitats.   Countless hours can be spent browsing through a vastcollection of antique fishing tackle. A gallery filled withcanvases, carvings and bronzes will draw and hold awildlife-art fan like moth to a light.   The place has been called many things, including &quot;Asportsman's Disneyland&quot; and &quot;the greatest outdoor sportingexpose in the world.&quot; Its actual name is Bass Pro ShopsOutdoor World. It's not only the No. 1 tourist attraction inMissouri, it's the world's largest sporting goods store.Between the many attractions and amusements sit row upon rowof equipment, clothing and assorted services.   Despite the current grandeur, Bass Pro's success story hadthe most humble of beginnings. &quot;A lot of it came through myown frustrations,&quot; said John L. Morris, founder and presidentof Bass Pro Shops. &quot;It started when I was a college studentin the late 1960s. I was fishing the bass tournaments, whichwere fairly new at the time, and I was intrigued by thespecialized baits and equipment that fishermen were bringingto the tournaments. I really wanted to use the same equipmentbut I couldn't find it locally.&quot;   Figuring he wasn't alone, Mr. Morris took a meager amountof capital on the road and simply bought such specialequipment until his funds were exhausted. Lacking the moneyto pay the overhead of a regular tackle shop, Mr. Morriscleared a few shelves in local liquor stores and put baitswhere bottles had once been.   By wisely reinvesting his profits it wasn't long beforeMr. Morris had a regular outlet. But his clients wanted more.&quot;We've always {had} a prime location,&quot; said Mr. Morris, a manwho features the spirit and looks of a man younger than his42 years. &quot;Springfield is in the heart of some of the bestbass fishing in the nation, so we had both local and visitinganglers to sell to.&quot; It was the latter that propelled BassPro Shops into the industry giant that it is today.   &quot;We started getting a lot of requests from people inKansas City and St. Louis who'd bought baits while in thearea but then couldn't find them when they got home,&quot; saidMr. Morris. &quot;They'd call and want us to ship things to themas soon as possible, so in 1974 we put together our firstcatalog.&quot;   Bass Pro Shops now markets a variety of full-colorcatalogs with a combined circulation in excess of 22 millioncopies. The catalogs, which carry a full line of hunting andfishing equipment, have become the bible of the seriousoutdoorsman. Not surprisingly, many of his faithful followerswanted to see the place that was the source of their manypleasures.   &quot;We had so many people just stopping by while they were inthe area that we decided to build a day-dream type of storefor our customers,&quot; said Mr. Morris. &quot;We wanted somethingthat would appeal to our customers while separating us fromour competitors, the mass merchants. I can't honestly saythat we set out to build anything like what we have now.&quot;   Outdoor World's collection of attractions and equipmentpulled more than three million visitors through its doors in1990. Many are simple vacationers, while others are drawn tothe store's special events and sales. On one occasion such anevent was a little too popular.   &quot;We routinely draw between 50,000 and 80,000 people to ourseasonal fairs and we can handle that,&quot; said Toby Bridges,Bass Pro Shops public relations director. &quot;But in March of1988 we had what we called the World's Fishing Fair. Itfeatured the entire who's who of fishing. We ended up withabout a quarter of a million people] We had Springfieldlocked up. There wasn't an available hotel room within 80miles. We need to be careful that doesn't happen again.&quot;   No matter when they tour the facilities, visitors willfind the most complete selection available. &quot;We've tried toset things up so someone can walk in and have absolutelyeverything ready to go when they leave,&quot; said Mr. Bridges.&quot;If they buy a rifle they can have it sighted in at our100-yard indoor range.&quot;   A walk down the many aisles reveals an inventory thatranges from a 39-cent trout fly to a fully rigged,top-of-the-line $34,000 boat. If that new gun or lure pansout, Outdoor World features a complete taxidermy studio.   Customers who need a place to try their new toys can stopat the in-store travel agency to plan a trip anywhere in theworld. One of the agency's most popular destinations is butan hour away, the legendary Table Rock Reservoir, one of thetop fishing lakes in the nation.   Like Outdoor World, Bass Pro Big Cedar Lodge at Table Rockhas quickly established itself as a driving force in theOzarks. Despite its recent birth in 1988, the posh, full-lineretreat has quickly matured into the best of the best in theregion.   But Bass Pro Shops' Midas touch comes as little surpriseto those who've spent time within the company. Walkingthrough the maze of offices and cubicles, it's quicklyapparent that fishing and hunting is more than just abusiness. Office walls are lined with sporting memorabilia,mounts and enlarged snapshots that feature a grinningemployee or Mr. Morris with a monstrous fish, prize buck orturkey. Obviously the product buyers, designers and thecompany president truly understand the needs of theirclientele.   ---   Mr. Pearce is a free-lance writer in Manhattan, Kan.</TEXT></DOC>
