The report, released Friday by the Alaska Federation of Nativesand the University of Alaska's Institute of Social and EconomicStudies, concludes that without major steps taken by the government,problems in the villages will likely only get worse.   Especially troubling, the report said, is a population surge inrural villages that will mean an increasing number of youngvillagers without jobs, dependent on government benefits and at highrisk of alcoholism, suicide and violent death.   ``During the next two decades young native adults, many of whomhave been brutalized by alcohol abuse, despair, violence and deathsin their homes and villages, will be having their own children,''the report said.   ``Unless the cycle can be broken, the projected high birth ratefor young native adults will create a new generation at risk, farmore numerous than the current one.''   The native birth rate in 1980 was twice the national average and50 percent higher than the rate for non-natives in Alaska, thereport said. At the current rate, Alaska's native population of75,000 is expected to double in 26 years.   Alcoholism, accidental death and suicide are major concerns amongnative Alaskans.   Alaskans drink the equal of 4 gallons of pure alcohol per personeach year, compared with the national average of 2.88 gallons,according to the National Institute for Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.   Alaska has twice the national average of accidental deaths, and70 percent are alcohol-related, according to a 1982 state report.   Suicide rates in rural Alaska quadrupled during the past decadeand doubled in urban areas, according to the 1982 report. Officialsbelieve 80 percent of the suicides were alcohol-related.   Among the recent report's conclusions:   _A plague of alcoholism, violence and self-destruction afflictsnatives throughout Alaska.   _Village economies, based largely on public assistance orgovernment jobs, cannot meet the needs of the growing nativepopulation.   _Despite improvements in public health, native Alaskans remainmore vulnerable to serious injury, infectious disease and violentdeath than non-natives.   The document was the first ``status report'' on Alaska nativespublished in a decade, said AFN President Janie Leask.   The report does not offer specific solutions, although Leask saidit has become obvious that many government programs intended to helpAlaska natives have failed.</TEXT></DOC>
