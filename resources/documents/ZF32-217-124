(SAIC), known forits system integration and software-development capabilities, to port,distribute and support HP VUE on Sun workstations.andM;With HP VUE, SPARCstation users can have access to a Motif-based,industry-standard user environment.andP;  HP VUE will support Motif and OPEN LOOKapplications and traditional UNIX*-system-based applications withoutmodification.andM;Previously available only on HP computers, HP VUE is a component of HP'sNewWave Computing strategy -- a strategy-based on open-systems solutions andindustry standards.andP;  HP believes it is a leader in open systems and isoffering hardware-independent technology that includes open-systemsapplications, tools and other hardware.andM;HP VUE is a graphic-user environment for UNIX-system-based computers.andP;  Basedon the industry-standard Motif and X Window System, HP VUE is believed to bethe only user environment that offers multiple workspaces, a front panelcontaining frequently-used applications, full customization and a systemwideHELP facility.andM;HP VUE makes a UNIX system easy to use without requiring technical expertise.andO;It provides access to applications and files across a distributed network.andM;EASE-OF-USE COMPONENTS Since HP VUE provides an easy-to-use interface to aUNIX operating system, novice users can perform basic tasks without knowledgeof the UNIX system.andP;  Experienced users still can access the UNIX system viatyped-in commands.andM;Five main HP VUE components provide users with a graphical interface to thefunctions of a UNIX system:andM;o  Log-in Manager -- provides a window allowing a user to enter the user'sname and password to gain access to the system.andP;  Applications can be startedautomatically at log-in;andM;o  File Manager -- uses an icon-based, drag-and-drop model for filemanipulation and navigation through directories.andP;  With a mouse, the user canmove, copy or delete files and access and manipulate files in local or remotedirectories;andM;o  Workspace Manager -- allows the user to manage and navigate through six ormore workspaces.andP;  Each workspace is a separate screen or collection ofwindows and icons that are defined by the user and accessed through a singleclick of a mouse.andP;  With multiple workspaces, users can organize work intoseparate screens and avoid window clutter;andM;o  Style Manager -- provides menus, slider bars and buttons that allow theuser to customize colors, background patterns, fonts and other settingsdynamically without having to edit a file manually that contains thosesettings.andP;  Once the HP VUE environment is customized, the configuration canbe saved so users later can resume with the same settings and applications.andM;o  HELP Manager -- is a system-wide, context-sensitive help facility.andP;  Itprovides help on individual items, applications, keys, version and helpitself, as well as tutorial lessions for beginners.andM;INTEGRATED WITH SUN ENVIRONMENT HP VUE will run on Sun Operating System 4.0or greater, with Sun OpenWindows 2.0.andP;  It will use the standard Sunmonochrome and color displays that are supported by the X Window System.andP;  TheOpenWindows Deskset utilities and existing Sun applications will run in HPVUE without modification.andM;In the past several months HP has introduced other software products for theSun SPARCstations:andM;o  HP OpenView network-management server software;andM;o  SoftBench, a CASE integration framework; andandM;o  HP TaskBroker, a network optimizer.andM;AWARD WINNING The visual design of HP VUE won a Gold Industrial DesignExcellence Award (IDEA) from the Industrial Designer's Society of America in1990.andP;  The IDEA awards are based on the decision of a panel of judges whoevaluate products for innovation, user benefits, customer appeal, positivesocial impact, benefits to client or manufacturer and appropriate use ofmaterials and manufacturing processes.andM;HP VUE was chosen for the award because of its visual appeal and thesimplicity and power of its design.andP;  This marked the first time the award wasgiven to a software product.andM;U.S.andP;  LIST PRICE AND DELIVERY HP VUE for Sun workstations is $550.andP;  It isexpected to be available from SAIC in the summer of 1991.andM;SAIC is a diversified company with products that serve national security,energy, environment, health, government and industry.andP;  SAIC is one of thelargest employee-owned businesses in the U.S.andP;  with more than 12,000employees and revenues in excess of $1 billion in its 1990 fiscal year.andP;  Tosupport its customer base, the company has 297 offices in the U.S.andP;  and 14offices in other countries.andP;  HP VUE on Sun will be supported out of SAIC'scorporate headquarters in San Diego, California.andM;Key Executive: Chung C.
