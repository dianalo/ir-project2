But not all money managers are aghast.   Many companies whose stocks were beaten down long ago tocheap multiples of annual per-share profit are surprisinginvestors with better-than-expected second-quarter earnings.To see such &quot;low P/E&quot; industry groups as aluminum andinsurance earn more than analysts predicted is enough tobring tears of joy to value investors' eyes. With earningsexpectations driving the stock market this year, theseforlorn owners of stocks that usually respond to healthyeconomic growth have watched their portfolios lag the market,while portfolios filled with blue-chip shares oftried-and-true growth companies raced ahead.</LP><TEXT>   Now, however, the tables may be turning. Last Monday,investors said enough to hyped-up earnings expectations andtook two steps back from the market. The Dow Jones IndustrialAverage tumbled 105 points in about an hour, then recoveredto post a 56.44-point loss. There's no question that earningsgrowth is still the stock market's motor. But what may bechanging is the kind of stocks investors are looking to forgrowth.   Whether money managers begin paring back positions in suchdouble-digit earnings growers as Coca-Cola and Wal-MartStores and begin reaching down to cheaper, neglected sharesof slower-growing companies depends largely on their economicoutlook.   Data released Friday morning showed the economy growing ata annual rate of 1.2%. That report shook up the stock market,contributing 22.28 points to the Dow industrials' loss of62.63 points for the week. If anything, thisweaker-than-expected growth bolstered the convictions ofgrowth stock managers, who are betting that the companies inwhich they own stakes will increase profits faster than thosewhose fortunes are tied to the economic cycle.   But economic growth between 1% and 2% is turning outstronger-than-expected earnings in many neglected sectors ofthe stock market. If the economy can sustain thisslow-but-steady pace, investors may begin to look at somecheap stocks that are entering stronger earnings cycles.   Copper and aluminum stocks, for example, which fall intothe nonferrous metals industry group, earned more in thesecond quarter than analysts expected. &quot;Better productpricing is materializing despite economic weakness,&quot; saidJoseph J. McAlinden, director of research at Dillon, Read andamp;Co. The coal industry also beat analysts' earningsexpectations.   If the economy does slow further, some strategists thinkthe Federal Reserve will take its foot off the monetarybrakes and drive interest rates lower to avoid recession.Reflation, as this policy is called in some quarters, is anemerging theme in the stock market these days, possiblybecause it's essential to the case of investors who foreseestepped-up earnings growth for many cyclical companies.   &quot;To the extent that the Federal Reserve stimulates more,you have tremendous upside potential&quot; in cyclical shares,said Stefan Abrams, chief investment strategist at Kidder,Peabody andamp; Co. &quot;Nobody is valuing these shares for reflation&quot;-- at least not yet.   If the economy lapses into a recession, which manystrategists think is possible, high-flying growth stocks maybe hurt more than cyclical shares. For all their talk aboutglobal earnings power, investors have been digging intoearnings reports to see how much came from the U.S. -- andshivered. It was McDonald's disappointing performance in U.S.stores that caused the stock to drop 12% in two days lastweek. Meanwhile, many cyclical stocks are already trading atprices that appear to anticipate a recession.   Positive and negative earnings surprises reflect analysts'exaggerated fears and hopes. So far in this period of profitreports, negative earnings surprises, on average, were 61.6%below the average estimate of at least three analysts.Positive surprises averaged 28% better than the forecasts.   Zacks Investment Research said the overall earningsdisappointment for the 750 companies that are in the DowJones Equity Market Index was 4.5% in the second quarter,compared with 3% in the first quarter. However, the number ofnegative surprises dropped to 51.5% in the second quarterfrom 54% in the first quarter, said Ben Zacks, executive vicepresident.   For a value investor, the trick is to find stocks that areat the trough of their earnings cycle, just before resultsstart heading up again.   Positive earnings surprises in aerospace, securitiesbrokers, and container makers don't reflect a profitturnaround, analysts say. Defense contracts will get slimmer;Wall Street is still weathering a drought in investmentbanking fees, and the paper packaging industry can stillproduce more than it can sell, analysts say.   But the positive surprises in the insurance, nonferrousmetals, oil and food industry groups may portend acceleratingearnings growth.   Life insurance firms seem headed toward higher earningsagain by cutting back on sales incentives and keeping moreinvestment income for themselves. &quot;A value investor with somedegree of patience should be accumulating&quot; insurance stocks,said Denis Callaghan, managing director at Alex. Brown andamp;Sons. Earnings aren't rising yet, he cautioned, but the ratewars are over, and earnings should be climbing unmistakablyby late 1991. He recommends Chubb and Marsh andamp; McLennan.   Earnings of food retailers should also be stable tobetter, said Edward Comeau, analyst at Oppenheimer andamp; Co. &quot;Youhave a whole array of highly leveraged companies out there.It is not in their best interest to get aggressive&quot; and cutprices, Mr. Comeau said.   Among metals stocks, Phelps Dodge's second-quarterearnings of $3.30 a share beat analysts' expectations bynearly 15%. Analysts figured that slow economic growth woulddrive the average price of copper below $1 a pound this year,but prices have averaged above $1.   &quot;The economy is expanding fast enough to create anenvironment where copper, aluminum and insurance companiesare able to raise prices,&quot; said Mr. McAlinden. Inflationremains stuck between 4% and 5%, even though economic growthis slow, because the unusually long eight-year expansion hascreated shortages in labor and other resources, he added.   Said Kidder's Mr. Abrams, &quot;If investors come to believethat we are in a recession, these {cyclical} stocks don'thave much downside {risk}, and they will be good performersbecause step A is recession, and step B is reflation&quot; by theFed.   But without renewed inflation to help boost productprices, many of these stocks may just muddle along withmediocre earnings in a 1% to 2% growth economy, Mr. Abramscautioned. For now, he recommends that investors stick with aportfolio that's two-thirds growth stocks. &quot;For the very longterm, that's where the big money has always been made,&quot; hesaid. &quot;Sam Walton {chairman of Wal-Mart} didn't get richtrading the cyclicals.&quot;   ---   Friday Market Activity                                                                                                          The Dow Jones Industrial Average tumbled 22.28 to 2898.51,largely because of weaker-than-expected second-quartereconomic growth and increased recession fears. Volume on theNew York Stock Exchange was a moderate 149,070,000 shares.   The industrial average's loss for the week, which startedwith a 56-point drop Monday, was 62.63, or 2.1%. Standard andamp;Poor's 500-stock index fell 2.3% for the week, while the BigBoard's composite index lost 2.2% and the Dow Jones EquityMarket Index dropped 2.4%. A steady stream of disappointingsecond-quarter earnings reports was the main influence.   Friday's preliminary report on second-quarter grossnational product -- the nation's output of goods and services-- reinforced the notion that the economy may be slowing toomuch. Investors were concerned not just because GNP growthwas less than consensus expectations -- 1.2% as opposed to1.8% -- but also because the figure included a decline inconsumption and a rise in inventories. Many consumer stockswere hit especially hard.   Investors clearly are refocusing on how weak economicgrowth might hurt profitability, rather than on how it mightlead to lower interest rates, which can help corporateprofits, said David Bostian, chief investment strategist atJesup, Josephthal.   Walt Disney added to investors' anxiety about earnings.The company's second-quarter profit rose 23%, which wasslightly lower than analysts' expectations. The stock dropped5 to 116.   McDonald's, which started the week with anearnings-related sell-off, lost 7/8 to 31 3/4.   Philip Morris continued to stumble on news earlier lastweek suggesting tobacco companies aren't immune toproduct-liability lawsuits. The stock fell 5/8 to 46 5/8.   Wal-Mart Stores dropped 1 to 31 5/8. Elsewhere in theconsumer sector, Anheuser-Busch dropped 1 1/2 to 42 3/8;Johnson andamp; Johnson fell 1 to 72 3/8; Procter andamp; Gamble slid 3/4to 86 1/8; Woolworth lost 3/4 to 31 1/2, and Toys &quot;R&quot; Us fell1 3/8 to 29 3/8.   International Business Machines fell 1 3/4 to 111 3/8.SoundView Financial Group downgraded the stock's investmentrating to &quot;sell&quot; from &quot;hold&quot; and lowered its 1991 earningsestimate, saying it expects IBM will have problems making thetransition to a new line of mainframe computers in the fourthquarter.   Other technology issues also declined: Compaq Computerfell 2 1/8 to 55 3/4; Digital Equipment lost 1 1/4 to 74 7/8;Unisys slid 3/4 to 11 1/8; Cray Research slipped 7/8 to 43;and Hewlett-Packard fell 5/8 to 44 1/8.   Oil stocks, on the other hand, generally held firm amidnews that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countriesagreed on a target price of $21 a barrel, up from $18, forcrude oil. Exxon rose 3/8 to 49 1/4, Chevron rose 1/4 to 771/4, and Amoco rose 7/8 to 54 1/4.   Dividend-related trades swelled volume in the two mostactive Big Board issues: Merrill Lynch, which fell 1/8 to 231/2 on 3.2 million shares, and Citicorp, which declined 1/2to 20 3/8 on 2.9 million shares.   Boeing advanced 1/8 to 59 1/4 on a better-than-expectedearnings report.   Mylan Laboratories skidded 2 1/2 to 19, extending itsslide in the wake of a weaker-than-expected quarterlyearnings report.   Pfizer added 1/4 to 74 3/8 on news that a Food and DrugAdministration panel set a tentative date for review ofSertraline, the company's anti-depressant drug.   Northrop fell 1 3/8 to 14 1/8 amid reports of a JusticeDepartment recommendation that the company be barred frommaking weapons for the U.S. military. Northrop has pleadedguilty to fraud charges.   Grumman gained 3/4 to 15 1/2 on a report that the companyexpects to report strong quarterly earnings.   Milton Roy advanced 1 3/4 to 28 5/8 after its board agreedto hold discussions with Sundstrand, which holds a 15% stakein the company and has offered $28 a share for the rest.   The American Stock Exchange Market Value Index slid 0.84to 355.49, extending its loss for the week to 1.4%.   Air andamp; Water Technologies Class A tumbled 3 1/8 to 24 3/4.Alex.
