Currently, toobtain such approvals, a federal association is required to file an applicationto amend its charter and/or bylaws with the association's Supervisory Agent.Immediately upon filing, the Supervisory Agent is required to forward promptlya copy of the application to the Director of the Office of District Banks,who then forwards the application to the Office of General Counsel. Thereafter,the Supervisory Agent is required to make a recommendation on the application,to approve or deny in whole or in part, to the Director of the Office ofDistrict Banks. Upon receipt of the application, the Office of GeneralCounsel determines whether the amendment would be in conformity with theprovisions of 12 CFR 544.2 or 552.4, if the application involves a charteramendment, or whether it is not inconsistent with the provisions of 12CFR 554.5 or 552.6 through 552.6-4, if it involves a bylaw amendment. TheOffice of General Counsel then generally prepares and signs a letter eitherapproving or denying the application that is then returned to the Officeof District Banks, which also executes the letter.<ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\2\ Resolution No. 86-719 (July 15, 1986), repealing <T3>inter alia</T3> Resolution No. 83-206 (April 8, 1983).In order to streamline this process, the Board is adopting 12 CFR 544.2(d),544.5(c), 552.4(e) and 552.5(d) so that applications for approval of charterand bylaw amendments may be granted or denied by a federal association'sPrincipal Supervisory Agent, <T3>provided</T3> that they (i) do not have the effect of rendering moredifficult or discouraging a merger, tender offer, or proxy contest, theassumption of control by a holder of a larger block of the association'sstock, or the removal of incumbent management (hereinfater, ``Anti-takeoverAmendments''), or (ii) do not involve a significant issue of law or policy.In addition, applications for approval of charter or bylaw amendments thatinclude Anti-takeover Amendments or that involve a significant issue oflaw or policy may be acted upon by the Office of General Counsel, whichwill have delegated authority to either approve or deny such proposed amendments.As appropriate, e.g., for amendments presenting policy issues of potentiallybroad precedential effect, the Office of General Counsel will refer proposedamendments to the Board for a determination.If an applicant believes its application is eligible to be processed underdelegated authority by the Principal Supervisory Agent pursuant to eitherof these provisions, the applicant should submit to the Principal SupervisoryAgent, together with the proposed amendments, a brief description of theproposed charter and/or bylaw amendments including a statement indicatingthat the amendment does not include any Anti-takeover Amendments and doesnot involve a significant issue of law or policy. Such statement shouldbe clearly marked ``Statement Regarding Eligibility for Processing UnderDelegated Authority.'' Although failure to provide such a statement willnot cause the application to be deemed deficient, it may cause delay inprocessing the application until a determination is made by the SupervisoryAgent as to whether the application may be processed under delegated authority.In addition, filing an application with the suggested statement will removethe necessity of concurrently filing the application with the Office ofGeneral Counsel. However, if the Supervisory Agent determines that theapplication includes an Anti-takeover Amendment or involves a significantissue of law or policy, contrary to an applicant's statement of delegatedauthority, then the application will be immediately forwarded to the Officeof General Counsel to avoid further delays in processing. Failure to fileproperly with the Office of General Counsel at the outset will cause theapplicable time frames for review not to commence until the applicationis received from the District Bank. Thus, an applicant that is uncertainas to whether a charter or bylaw amendment may include an Anti-takeoverAmendment or involve a significant issue of law or policy is strongly encouragedto contact either its Supervisory Agent or the Office of General Counselfor guidance on the issue prior to filing an application so as to avoidunnecessary delays in processing the application.As a general matter, Anti-takeover Amendments that will cause an applicationfor approval not to be processed under delegated authority include <T3>but are not limited to</T3> (i) establishing supermajority approvalrequirements for specified corporate transactions, (ii) establishing asupermajority vote to cancel an existing or proposed supermajority provision,(iii) establishing a supermajority vote to amend an association's charter,(iv) reducing an existing or proposed supermajority vote requirement ifa transaction involves a related party to the association, <T3>e.g.,</T3> an insider or 5 percent or more shareholder, (v) issuingpoison pill preferred stock or establishing shareholders' rights plans,<T3>i.e.,</T3> the creation of a class of stock or the issuance of optionsto management that will serve to discourage prospective acquiror's of theassociation's stock, (vi) establishing employee benefit, stock ownership,or stock option plans that provide a means to defend against a takeoverattempt, (vii) provisions that unreasonably restrict the ability of theshareholders to remove the current board of directors or that unreasonablyrestrict the ability of the shareholders to call a special meeting, (viii)establishing a supermajority vote requirement, or requiring the consentof management, for a large shareholder to vote those shares that it ownsthat exceed a designated percentage of the outstanding stock of the association,(ix) establishing fair price provisions for an association's stock thatwould make it more expensive for a prospective acquiror of an association'sstock to purchase a controlling interest of the association without thecooperation of current management, (x) limiting the shareholders' abilityto nominate directors and to introduce new business proposals at a shareholders'meeting, and (xi) requiring a supermajority shareholder vote to removea director.In addition, a charter or bylaw amendment will be considered to involvea significant issue of law or policy if it contains unique, novel, complex,or nationally precedential issues of law or policy. Examples in this areainclude provisions attempting to limit the liability of directors for breachesof certain types of fiduciary duties, and officer and director indemnificationprovisions that do not conform to the requirements of 12 CFR 545.121.The standard of review for applications for approval of charter and bylawamendments is not changed as a result of these amendments. All routinecharter amendments filed with the Supervisory Agent may be granted preliminaryapproval so long as such amendments do not differ in any material respectfrom the charter amendments granted preliminary approval under 12 CFR 552.4(b)or other law or regulation, including the indemnification provisions of12 CFR 545.121. In addition, all routine bylaw amendments that are notmaterially inconsistent with the provisions of 12 CFR 552.6 through 552.6-4may be approved by the Principal Supervisory Agent. Thus, for example,an applicant filing an application to adopt an indemnification provisionin its charter or bylaws may be eligible to receive approval for the applicationfrom the Principal Supervisory Agent, provided, that such provision doesnot differ <T3>materially</T3> from the requirements of 12 CFR 545.121.\3\<NOTE/><ITAG tagnum="28"/><NOTE/>\3\This particular provision is referenced due to the factthat in the past there has been considerable confusion among applicantsas to what type of wording is acceptable for an indemnification charteror bylaw amendment. In this regard, although the precise language of 12CFR 545.121 need not be adopted for a charter or bylaw amendment to beapproved by the Principal Supervisory Agent, any such amendment shouldnot exceed the limitations set forth in 12 CFR 545.121, with the exceptionthat officers, directors and employees of wholly-owned subsidiaries alsomay be included within the scope of permissible indemnification.The amendments to 12 CFR Parts 544 and 552 also include an appeal procedurethat an applicant may utilize if it feels that the Principal SupervisoryAgent has erroneously denied its application. In this regard, if an applicationdelegated to the Principal Supervisory Agent is denied, the applicant may,within 30 days after notification of the Principal Supervisory Agent'sdecision, file a request for review with the Office of General Counsel.Upon receipt of such a request, which should include a copy of the applicationand indicate the specific reasons why the Principal Supervisory Agent'sdenial is contended to be erroneous, the Office of General Counsel willhave 60 days to review the application to determine whether to approveor deny the amendment. If the Office of General Counsel does not deny theappeal within such 60 day period, then the appeal request and the amendmentshall be deemed to be automatically approved.Finally, in connection with the aforementioned amendments to 12 CFR Parts544 and 552, the Board is adopting 12 CFR 554.2(e), 552.4(f) and 552.5(e)regarding the filing requirements for applications for approval of charterand bylaw amendments. The foregoing changes are effective January 30, 1989 and are applicableto applications filed after such date.Because this change is nonsubstantive, the Board finds that observanceof the notice and comment period pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(b) and 12 CFR508.11 and the 30-day delay of effective date pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 553(d)and 12 CFR 508.14 is unnecessary and contrary to the public interest.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Parts 544 and 552</ITAG>Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Savings and loan associations,Securities.Accordingly, the Board hereby amends Parts 544 and 552, Subchapter C, ChapterV, Title 12, Code of Federal Regulations, as set forth below.<ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * *</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="76">SUBCHAPTER C_FEDERAL SAVINGS AND LOAN INSURANCE CORPORATION</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="52">PART 544_CHARTER AND BYLAWS</ITAG>1.
