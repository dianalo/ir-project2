At least 1,300were arrested.   President Roh Tae-woo told the nation his government will nottolerate violent campus protest. He said unchecked student activismwould endanger the Olympic Games, which open Sept. 17 in Seoul.   Officers were seen taking away hundreds of protesters who triedto march from Seoul to the border truce village of Panmunjom, 35miles north of the capital, for talks with North Korean studentleaders.   Witnesses saw dozens of protesters and policmen injured but noinjury statistics were available. Authorities said they arrested1,300 students but released many after warnings.   Riot police fired tear gas at Yonsei University in western Seouland charged into a crowd of students. They kicked protesters, beatthem and dragged about 200 away.   In a speech marking the 43rd anniversary of Korea's independencefrom Japanese colonial rule, Roh said: ``We cannot any longertolerate activities which destroy free democracy, our way of life,''   He said the Olympics will bring East and the West together, and``peoples around the world are praying for the success of theGames. Therefore, the people and the government will not forgiveanyone who spoils the festival through mob action or the throwingof firebombs, no matter for what plausible cause.''   Roh delivered a similar warning Friday, accusing radicalstudents and dissidents of siding with North Korea and trying tooverthrow the government.   In the speech Monday, he also proposed a summit with PresidentKim Il Sung of North Korea to discuss the future of the peninsula,which was divided at the end of World War II. Similar proposals inthe past have led nowhere, but the two Koreas are consideringparliamentary talks on easing tension.   A few hours after the speech, thousands of radical studentsrallied at Yonsei and tried to march into the streets on their wayto the border.   Troopers in green combat fatigues and black-visored helmetsfired tear gas and charged the protesters, who shouted ``Unite thefatherland!'' and ``Yankee go home!''   Students who did not resist huddled in groups on the ground,clinging to each other as policemen beat them with fists and evenriot shields.   Senior officers hit and slapped their own men in an attempt tostop the beatings. One commander slashed at troopers with a ridingcrop.   Many students apparently decided to let themselves be arrested,a change from their normal tactic of violent resistance. About 100members of the ``unification vanguard'' tied themselves together sopolice would have to arrest them as a group.   Among those detained were 12 leaders who were to haverepresented South Korea at the talks Monday in Panmunjom.   Police blocked a similar march to Panmunjom on June 10. About3,000 radical students tried to march Monday, a much smaller numberthan in June, and there was virtually no evidence of public support.   The radicals, a small but powerful minority on campuses, haveseized on national unification in their campaign against thegovernment.   South Korean authorities declared Monday's march illegal anddeployed 25,000 riot police in Seoul to stop it. They insist thatall dialogue with North Korea be conducted through governmentchannels.   When their march from Yonsei was blocked Monday, studentsregrouped on campus and surged out with rocks and firebombs to dobattle for an hour with about 7,000 riot police. Volleys of teargas were fired from armored police vans.   About 600 protesters were arrested downtown and in other partsof Seoul. In one confrontation in the heart of the capital, 700students lay down on the pavement with their hands interlocked aspolice charged, and 200 were taken away.   Student leaders told a rally at Yonsei they would not stoptrying to oust the Roh government and reunite Korea. Dozens ofstudents cut their fingers with razors and wrote four Koreanletters meaning ``national unification'' in blood.   They denounced the United States, saying Washington supportsmilitary rule in South Korea, and demanded withdrawal of the 42,000U.S. troops based here under a mutual defense treaty.</TEXT></DOC>
