The Denver-based concern will combine its Mountain Bell, Northwestern Bell and Pacific Northwest Bell units into one company called U S West Communications. The Bell name will disappear, and the Bell logo will be reduced to a small, punctuation-like tag line at the end of the new name.    U S West is betting that the consolidation will bolster awareness among corporate customers in its sprawling, 14-state territory. Other motives include centralizing distribution and marketing efforts and cutting costs. The company said it decided to scrap the 100-year-old Bell label because consumers no longer associate the name with technology leadership.    The move is in character for four-year-old U S West, which has fancied itself a bold innovator since its birth as a result of the breakup of the Bell system. U S West's culture has adopted the metaphors of pioneers and cattle wranglers of the Old West, and its business slogan is a trail boss's creed: &quot;If you don't make dust, you eat dust.&quot;    The Bell name itself has been a powerful point of contention since the breakup. After the seven regional companies were created, American Telephone andamp; Telegraph Co. fought vigorously and unsuccessfully for the right to use the Bell name as its own. Now, if other regional Bells follow U S West's example and scrap the name, as some industry consultants predict, it would be an ironic twist in the breakup saga.    Thomas F. Madison, executive vice president of U S West and chief architect of the new structure, called the plan &quot;critical to our being successful.&quot; U S West's telephone revenue has been sapped steadily by increasing competition. What's more, the three operating companies weren't structured properly to address marketplace needs, making it difficult for them to fend off such rivals as MCI Communications Corp. and ATandamp;T.    In 1985, for example, U S West revenue rose 7.3% to $7.8 billion from the prior year. But in 1986, the increase was only 6.3%, and in 1987 the gain fell to 1.6%.    &quot;We've got to do better than that,&quot; said Howard P. Doerr, U S West's chief financial officer. If the new structure is successful, Mr. Doerr said, the company expects to see annual revenue growth of about 10% after five years.    The bold plan carries big risks. The name change could backfire, adding to confusion in the marketplace. Many customers are already frustrated by the general chaos created by the breakup in 1984; there is a danger now that some could come to resent U S West in particular.    But U S West hopes that its new corporate motto, &quot;Say yes to customers,&quot; will help make the transition smoother. Under the new structure, employees are being trained to go to extra lengths to accommodate consumers, from changing a billing date to having phone service installed at odd hours. In addition, a traditional, geographic approach will be replaced with an organization defined by market segment: residential, business, and carrier-and-information services.    &quot;We were managing these markets across several states. We lacked focus,&quot; said U S West's Mr. Madison. &quot;This kind of a program will allow us to be more productive and efficient.&quot;    Mr. Madison said the company plans to boost its sales staff as much as 15% this year to implement the new plan swiftly. He said special attention will be given to the residential market, to small and medium-sized business clients and to the government and education sectors, which previously were ignored.    Under the old structure, all of those sectors were lumped together and served by one sales team. Consequently, sales people tended to concentrate on the largest business customers and slighted everybody else. &quot;Now we are telling our people, 'Pay attention to this sector. This will be all you're going to focus on,'&quot; Mr. Madison said. &quot;I think we can double some of these markets.&quot;    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading, U S West closed Friday at $52.625, down 62.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
