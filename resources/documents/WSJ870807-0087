Home buyers with fixed-rate mortgages committed to an average effective interest rate of 10.72% in early July, down from 10.86% the previous month, the Federal Home Loan Bank Board reported.    As recently as March, fixed-rate home loans carried an average rate of 9.47% -- a figure that includes the rate offered by mortgage lenders plus points paid by the home buyer. The figures apply to single-family home mortgages maturing in 15 years or more.    Richard Peach, senior economist with the Mortgage Bankers Association, called the surge in rates since March &quot;very unusual, even in this day of volatile interest rates.&quot; But the July decline, while welcome news for home buyers and builders, is &quot;probably only temporary comfort,&quot; Mr. Peach added. &quot;We expect mortgage rates and all interest rates to trend up in the third and fourth quarters and through all of 1988, due primarily to the economy picking up steam.&quot;    Mark Obrinsky, economist with the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, said mortgage rates through early autumn will likely &quot;bounce around from day to day,&quot; and then begin a slow rise, reflecting higher inflation and a weaker dollar.    Rates on adjustable-rate mortgages also tailed off in July to an average 8.70% from 8.75% in June, the bank board said. In contrast to rates on fixed-rate mortgages, rates on adjustable-rate home loans have increased only slightly since spring.    The rate spread of 1.81 percentage points between fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages, on all loans that closed in early July, was the widest since the Bank Board began reporting separate figures for the two types of mortgages six years ago.    The rate difference has made adjustable-rate loans increasingly popular. In July, 50% of all home loans closed were the adjustable-rate variety, compared with just 22% in March.    Mr. Obrinsky said adjustable-rate mortgages cushioned the market, giving buyers a financing option when fixed-rate loans surged last spring. &quot;If this had happened 10 years ago, it would have battered the housing market,&quot; he said. &quot;In this case, the impact was rather small.&quot;    The bank board said the average price of a new home dropped to $116,700 in July, nearly $20,000 less than the average price in April. The average term for conventional mortgages closed in July was 26.6 years, about the same as in June. </TEXT></DOC>
