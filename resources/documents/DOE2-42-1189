In 1985, the Health Minister therefore decidedto launch a nationwide survey on carbon monoxide poisoning. This operation,spanning several years, involves the systematic gathering of informationon accidents accountable to carbon monoxide, through close collaborationof all concerned at a local level (eg. national and municipal healthservices, fire brigades, poison centers, forensic medecine, emergencyservices, general practitioners).
