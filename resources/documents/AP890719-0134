Ito, a coastal resort city on the Izu peninsula, about 60 milessouthwest of Tokyo, has had more than 23,000 temblors, including 486strong enough to be felt, since June 30.   On July 13, an undersea volcano erupted off the Ito coast,creating a mound 82 feet high, according to the Maritime SafetyAgency, Japan's coast guard.   Volcanic activity has slowed since then, and no strongearthquakes have been recorded since Sunday. No injuries or damageswere reported after the eruption.   But the Central Meteorological Agency has warned the volcano islikely to erupt again because the movement of magma, or molten rock,continues.   Kakefu said the hospital, which has an average of 250 outpatientsdaily, Monday began receiving more patients with stomach aches,insomnia and diarrhea, ``all from fear and stress.''   ``They didn't feel sick for a couple of days after the eruptionbecause they were still tense,'' he said. Kakefu said he does nothave any statistics, but indicated the number of such patients islikely to increase.   Pets have also been developing similar symptoms since shortlyafter the eruption, said Masaaki Mochizuki, an Ito veterinarian.   He said he has examined 129 cats and dogs suffering the``earthquake syndrome'' between July 4 and July 14.   Symptoms such as nausea, diarrhea and loss of appetite werefrequent among cats, and many dogs suffered skin problems includingrashes and hair loss, he said. He said some dogs were also afflictedwith coughing and trembling due to excessive fear.   ``My busiest day was July 14, the day after the eruption,''Mochizuki said. ``Symptoms in animals appeared earlier than inpeople because animals are more sensitive, and they feel thetemblors and noises more strongly.''   ``We humans have information from the municipal office and themeteorological centers, which help to relieve our tensions ... butsuch things don't work for animals,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
