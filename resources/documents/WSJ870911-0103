With yields just topping 6%, money market funds are hardly high rollers. But they're drawing assets again because their safe haven looks good -- at least temporarily -- to investors agonizing over the thinning bravado of stocks and the latest bond bashing tied to rising interest rates. Money market fund shares don't fluctuate in price, thereby safeguarding principal for investors who want to buy time before settling into an alternative.    The Investment Company Institute says that money market funds rose sharply to $245.09 billion for the week ended Wednesday, despite big outflows by institutional investors following the recent boost in the Federal Reserve's discount rate. The shift by institutional investors was more than offset by individuals moving out of stock and bond funds, the institute said.    Meanwhile, the Donoghue Organization, which tracks 290 taxable and 130 tax-free money market funds, reports a big increase in the funds it tracks, too. William Donoghue, head of the organization, figures the increases are due to the many &quot;bond fund investors who are waking up to the fact they're losing money&quot; along with the more nervous stock investors.    Mr. Donoghue sees other forces at work, too, including uneasiness among some savings and loan customers who are leaving those accounts for the money market funds. &quot;It is ironic to see 'nervous' money leaving those insured accounts,&quot; he says.    Much of the inflow to money market funds obviously comes from other mutual funds -- notably certain municipal and long-term bond funds whose net asset values have been hit hard by rising interest rates. But many fund complexes say they aren't experiencing overall net redemptions -- that is, more money in total leaving than coming into the funds -- though they acknowledge many investors are readjusting assets.    Vanguard Group, which manages some $30 billion, says its overall stock and bond fund redemptions were running about $20 million a day between Sept. 4 and Wednesday. A little more than half was from bond funds, with the balance exiting common stock funds, says John Bogle, chairman. After counting new sales during the same period, he says Vanguard is maintaining a &quot;marginally positive cash flow.&quot; The municipal bond funds are showing marginal net redemptions while the stock funds are holding up with net new sales.    A spokesman for T. Rowe Price Associates says movement &quot;isn't in great amounts. But the pattern among investors who are exchanging is moving out of stock and bond funds into money market funds.&quot; The notable exceptions, he says, are switches into international stock and bond funds.    T. Rowe Price's Prime Reserve money market fund was up about $80 million to $3.24 billion for the month through Wednesday. Among other big groups, Kemper Financial Services says its money market funds &quot;are going strong&quot; and several other large fund groups also report money parking in the funds.    Alternatives might have been easier for the exiting bond fund investors to find in the spring when the stock market was still roaring. This time around stocks, too, have stumbled off the bull market course often enough to cause investor concern.    &quot;The way I read what happened in April is that the (bond fund) consumer had a bad experience, and is continuing to have one,&quot; says Michael Goldstein, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. Mr. Goldstein holds that &quot;environmental factors&quot; such as rising interest rates could favor competing investments, notably bank certificates of deposit. Yields on bank CDs are inching up along with rates and may appeal to investors willing to lock in a rate for at least a half-year.    But bond investors aren't the only ones who are antsy.    Even some of the most aggressive stock fund players -- those who trade Fidelity Investment's sector funds -- recently pulled in their horns.    During the week ended Sept. 4, assets dropped in several Fidelity Select stock funds, including chemicals, brokerages, and savings and loans. But assets jumped in the group's precious metals fund and the money market fund. Overall, the movement evened itself out for the house as Fidelity wound up the period with a total of about $3.71 billion in total Select series assets -- the same amount as when the period began.    Assets of the nation's money market funds rose $1.26 billion to $245.09 billion in the week ended Wednesday, the Investment Company Institute, said.    The sharp gain follows the prior week's revised decline of $426.3 million, which previously was reported as a $258.2 million increase. The revised total was $243.83 billion.    &quot;In the aftermath of the recent hike in the Federal Reserve discount rate, institutional investors shifted dollars from money funds to higher-yielding short-term securities,&quot; said Alfred P. Johnson, vice president and chief economist for the Washington-based trade group.    &quot;These outflows, however, were more than offset by individual investors who moved some of their stock and or long-term debt holdings into the safe haven of money market mutual funds,&quot; he added.    Assets of 200 general purpose funds rose $2.04 billion to $72.37 billion, assets of 93 broker-dealer funds rose $780.4 million to $108.14 billion. Assets of 103 institutional funds dropped $1.56 billion to $64.58 billion.    The average seven-day yield for funds, in the week ended Tuesday, rose to 6.04% from 6.03% a week earlier, according to Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston, Mass.-based newsletter. The average 30-day yield for funds increased to 6.01% from 6%, and the average maturity of funds dropped to 42 days from 43 days.    Banks, which compete with money funds, were paying an average yield of 5.39% on money market savings accounts in the week ended Wednesday, compared with 5.36% the week before, according to Banxquote Online, a New York-based information service. Bank yields were 6.70% on six-month savings certificates of deposit, compared with 6.52% the previous week, and 7.17% for one-year bank savings CDs, compared with 6.98%. </TEXT></DOC>
