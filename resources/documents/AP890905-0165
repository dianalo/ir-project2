Growing stagnant, MTV and its music-video format have beenrevamped from top to bottom, and have emerged on its eighthanniversary as one of television's more robust and diverseenterprises.   In the wake of a two-year overhaul spread across MTV and its twoaffiliated channels _ VH-1 and Nickelodeon-Nick at Nite _ MTVNetworks now features a mix of game shows, children's programs,newscasts, dance shows, sitcom reruns and rap music.   MTV's archly irreverent ``Remote Control'' quiz show has becomeso popular that it's now a hit in the TV syndication market.Nickelodeon, jammed with offbeat children's shows, will deliver2,343 episodes this year, an increase of more than 300 percent since1986.   After losing about $50 million in its first two years, MTVNetworks now has a combined subscriber base of 125 million viewers,MTV says, and a growing following overseas. Earnings for the threechannels through the second quarter of this year were up 21 percentfrom a year ago, to $17.9 million.   All the same, MTV's evolution has been clumsy at times, and thefuture is dotted with challenges. Even after a redesign, soft-rockVH-1 still attracts meager ratings. And Nick at Nite has yet tobecome more than a rest home for old sitcoms.   In the coming months both MTV and Home Box Office will introduceall-comedy cable channels.   ``We think a comedy channel is a real logical next step for us,''said Tom Freston, MTV Network's president and chief executiveofficer. ``But I think that you probably will see only one (comedychannel) surviving.''   With HA!, as MTV's comedy channel will be called, MTV will bechasing the competition.   ``I think that what we're doing is unique and innovative and whatthey're doing is already available on other cable channels,'' saidDick Beahrs, president of HBO's Comedy Channel.   The Comedy Channel, which debuts in November, will be composed ofbrief comedy sketches culled from movies and nightclub performances,complemented by occasional feature-length films and sitcoms. HA!,using longer-form program packages, premieres April 1.   MTV's other channels continue to be reworked. VH-1, now 4 yearsold, faces perhaps the most difficult battle.   Freston labels VH-1 ``a work in progress.'' A few cable operatorshave called it something else: unnecessary.   When the Consumer News and Business Channel began in April,several cable systems bumped VH-1 to make room at a cost of nearly amillion subscribers, according to CNBC. MTV, however, says it'scloser to 250,000.   VH-1's problem is that it is still seen as the drydock for MTVflotsam. ``It was a repository for everything MTV didn't want toplay,'' Freston said. ``And it still has a way to go.''   VH-1 these days offers an eclectic musical blend of artists suchas Enya, Fine Young Cannibals, 10,000 Maniacs and Edie Brickell andamp;New Bohemians. Gone for good, VH-1 promises, are Julio Iglesias andNeil Diamond.   The channel also has added lifestyle reports, entertainment news,nostalgia programming such as ``My Generation'' and the Sunday jazzshow ``New Visions.'' A new comedy program will join the VH-1 lineupthis fall.   ``What music videos did to music, we can do to information andentertainment,'' said Ed Bennett, VH-1's president. Ratings have yetto take off.   John Reardon, the new president of MTV, echoed the theme ofdiversifying as he explained the burst of packaged shows nowarriving on MTV's schedule: ``Clearly, we've been trying to keep theviewer interested longer.''   So MTV's videos from acts such as Bon Jovi, Madonna and Princeare being supplemented by the dance program ``Club MTV,'' the rapshow ``Yo! MTV Raps,'' ``Monty Python's Flying Circus,'' regularnews broadcasts, occasional concerts and a variety of other originalprograms including ``Remote Control.''   Among other projects discussed for MTV's future are a daily soapopera, at least two movies and a music-rating show.   Originally a property of Warner-Amex, Nickelodeon is MTV's oldestproperty at age 10. Its gross ad billings have grown from $31.8million in 1988 to an estimated $48.2 million this year, accordingto Paul Kagan and Associates.   The children's service, which switches to the sitcom-heavy ``Nickat Nite'' at 8 p.m. in most time zones, offers whimsical programmingsuch as the messy game show ``Double Dare,'' the legal send-up``Kids' Court'' and the talk show ``Don't Just Sit There.''   ``We're always trying to stay as close to kids as we can,'' saidGeraldine Laybourne, president of Nickelodeon and Nick at Nite.``And we believe that they deserve a full entertainment network.Everything doesn't have to be a ratings hit.''   Among the new shows being added to the network's schedule are``Eureeka's Castle,'' an ambitious daily series for preschoolers,and ``Hey Dude,'' a weekly situation comedy set at a dude ranch. Achildren's cooking show, a daily news program and a soap opera alsoare being planned.   And then there's Nick at Nite.   Although Nick at Nite's been around since 1985, its firstoriginal program _ a spoof review show called ``On the Television''_ was just announced this July. Other than that, Nick at Niteconsists of reruns of such ancient sitcoms as ``Mr. Ed,'' ``My ThreeSons'' and ``Laugh-In.''   Laybourne conceded, ``We have to have something on the networkwhere if (audiences) don't watch tonight, they're going to miss it.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Wed PMs, Sept. 6</NOTE></DOC>
