First, the House and Senate have sent President Reaganlegislation that would continue the industry's protection _ uniquein federal law _ against being required to pay unlimited amounts ofmoney to victims of a reactor accident.   And on Monday, the Senate approved legislation long sought bythe nuclear industry to streamline the licensing process for newnuclear plants and to attempt to revitalize the moribund U.S.uranium industry.   Industry spokesman have said that a new licensing process, alongwith a standardized plant design they hope the process willproduce, will break the drought that has seen no new nuclear plantconstruction in this decade.   The licensing and uranium provisions were added on the Senatefloor to legislation that would convert the Nuclear RegulatoryCommission from a five-member panel to a Nuclear Safety Agencyheaded by a chief administrator.   The bill, approved 89-6, also would strengthen NRC proceduresfor investigating nuclear plant accidents and wrongdoing by NRCemployees.   However, none of the several House committees that sharejurisdiction over the legislation has held hearings on all of theSenate bill's many elements. It was considered unlikely that thecomplex legislation would clear Congress in the five weeksremaining on the schedule for the 1988 session.   The liability bill sent to Reagan, a 15-year renewal of the 1957Price-Anderson Act, would set $7.1 billion as the maximum amountthe owners of nuclear generators would have to pay in damagesarising from a single accident.   That amount is 10 times the previous liability cap. It is abouttriple what the industry was lobbying for. But it could have beenfar worse from the industry's standpoint.   Some government reports have estimated that a major nuclearaccident could cause $100 billion in damages. Environmental groupsand the Ralph Nader organization had been pushing for unlimitedliability for the industry.   Officials of the Office of Management and Budget say it islikely that Reagan will sign the Price-Anderson reauthorization,which leaves it to Congress to decide how to find the money neededto pay more than $7.1 billion in damages.   Barring an accident requiring large payments to victims, thehigher liability limit is not expected to have any major impact onelectricity rates charged by utilities with nuclear plants,according to congressional staffers.   Sen. James McClure, R-Idaho, added the amendment Monday to theNRC restructuring bill that would scrap the process under which anew plant must get separate construction and operating licensesfrom the agency.   The industry has blamed much of its problems in getting newplants built on the NRC's two-step process. It has said that asingle license would spur development of cheaper, standardizedplant designs.   The uranium industry also won a long-sought provision with a78-17 vote for an amendment that would force plant operators to paya federal fee if they obtain more than 37.5 percent of theirreactor uranium from foreign sources.   The amendment by Sens. Wendell Ford, D-Ky., and Pete Domenici,R-N.M., also would create government-owned corporation to take overthe U.S. uranium enrichment program and spend $750 million toacquire up to 30 million pounds of uranium by 1996.   Their plan also would authorize spending about $1 billion toclean up uranium tailings _ the waste created by uranium miningactivities in Western states.   Voting against the bill Monday were Bill Bradley, D-N.J.; MarkHatfield, R-Ore.; Gordon Humphrey, R-N.H.; Frank Lautenberg,D-N.J.; Patrick Leahy, D-Vt.; and William Proxmire, D-Wis.   Not voting were Joseph Biden, D-Del., Alan Cranston, D-Calif.,Phil Gramm, R-Texas, Bob Kasten, R-Wis., and Lowell Weicker, R-Conn.</TEXT></DOC>
