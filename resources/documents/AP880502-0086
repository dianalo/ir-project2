OATIS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><TEXT>   A storm packing powerful wind dumped heavy snow on Westernmountains today, leaving more than a foot of snow in some areas,after closing entrances to Yellowstone National Park and kicking updust storms blamed for two traffic deaths.   The storm also contributed to weekend wind in SouthernCalifornia that left one boater dead and another missing andbelieved drowned.   It was easing eastward onto the Plains but Wyoming, first struckby the storm on Saturday, was expected to continue feeling itseffects well into Tuesday.   The National Weather Service predicted up to a foot of snowtoday in higher elevations of eastern Wyoming and northern andcentral Colorado and the Black Hills of western South Dakota.Oregon's Cascade Mountains were expected to get up to 6 inches.   The 7 a.m. temperature in northwestern Wyoming was just 10degrees in Yellowstone National Park. The weather service warnedfruit growers along Utah's Wasatch Front that a hard freeze waspossible today and tonight.   The storm left up to 14 inches of snow in the mountains andfoothills of south-central Montana.   Eight inches of snow fell in northwestern Wyoming, closingYellowstone's eastern and southern entrances Sunday. South of thepark, 5 inches of snow was reported in Moose and Jackson, wheredowned power lines caused blackouts.   Heavy rain fell in advance of the snow, with 2.25 inches in 24hours at Alliance, Neb., and 1.86 inches at Rapid City, S.D., theweather service reported.   Interstate 80 in Wyoming was closed today in Wyoming fromLaramie west to Walcott Junction and road conditions continued todeteriorate as snowfall increased over the state's southernsection, police said. Wind gusting to 40 mph created blizzardconditions around Cheyenne, parts of which had no power thismorning.   Schools in Cheyenne were closed and workers in federal officesthere were told to follow their department's bad weather plan.State government workers living in rural areas were told their paywould not be docked if they chose not to drive into Cheyenne, saidDennis Curran, spokesman for Gov. Mike Sullivan.   Snow also was widespread over eastern sections of Idaho andnorthern Utah. Parts of eastern Idaho got 5 inches of snowovernight. Up to 8 inches was reported at Tooele, Utah, with 7inches at the Snowbird ski resort east of Salt Lake City and 5inches at Alta.   ``The trees are loaded (with snow) and it's the kind of sceneski films look for. In fact, one's coming in so they timed it justright,'' said Mike Elwood of Snowbird.   ``There's quite a few powder hounds, diehards out there,''Elwood said. ``That's what they love and that's what they'reskiing.''   In eastern Colorado, the storm unleashed 50 mph wind and causeda dust storm. Visibility dropped to zero and two pileups occurredon Interstate 70, killing two people and injuring 17, officialssaid.   ``Visibility was down to zero,'' said State Patrol Trooper JamesE. Price. ``Dust was blowing so it covered everything like a filmof oil. You couldn't see in front of your face.''   About 76 miles of I-70 between Limon and Burlington were closedfor more than two hours until visibility improved.   In Utah, trucks and trailers with high profiles were banned fromInterstate 80 at Wendover because of the strong wind. Snow and windclosed Interstate 15 north of Point of the Mountain south of SaltLake City for several hours.   A young cougar that may have been separated from its mother bythe storm wandered into the Salt Lake City suburb of Holladay, saidBill Bates, a biologist with the state Division of WildlifeResources. The cougar was shot with a tranquilizer gun and returnedto the mountains.   In New Mexico, wind gusted to 80 mph in Ruidoso and 60 mph inAlbuquerque. Ruidoso's Sierra Blanca Regional Airport was closed.   The northern and central high Plains also had high wind. Gustsexceeding 50 mph were reported throughout the Dakotas and up to 60mph in central Colorado.   The wind whipped loose topsoil into a dust storm aroundAberdeen, S.D., forcing some drivers to turn on their headlights inthe middle of the day Sunday. Farmer Harry Pharis Jr. of ruralGroton said about 30 acres of newly sprouted barley was cut down bythe wind and blowing grit.   The difference in pressure between the storm and a high-pressurefront off the West Coast generated 65 mph wind in SouthernCalifornia on Saturday, causing waves that destroyed a municipalpier in Redondo Beach and stranded 1,400 tourists on Santa CatalinaIsland.   Boat service to Catalina resumed Sunday.   The body of a man believed to have jumped from a disabled boatwashed ashore Sunday, said Los Angeles County Lifeguard Sgt. TomHargett. Another man knocked off a boat Saturday near Catalina wasmissing and believed drowned, said Coast Guard Petty OfficerCharles Embleton.</TEXT></DOC>
