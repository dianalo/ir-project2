August usually is a slow month for machine-tool builders. But last month's orders at U.S. machine-tool plants totaled $339.6 million, up from $142 million a year earlier.    Machine tools are sophisticated machines, which frequently cost $200,000 or more, that shape metal into parts ranging from truck axles to cookware.    Orders for milling machines, machining centers, grinders, lathes, boring mills and other machines that shape metal by cutting were $261.5 million, nearly triple the year-earlier's $96.4 million. Last month's orders for metal-forming presses and other machines to shape metal with pressure were $78 million, up 71% from $45.7 million a year earlier.    For the first eight months of 1988, U.S. machine-tool companies reported that export orders more than doubled to $366.3 million from $174.7 million.    August shipments were $153.9 million, down nearly 3% from $158.4 million a year earlier. Shipments have lagged well behind orders so far this year. It often takes several months to complete engineering and production of these sophisticated machines.    The industry's backlog of unshipped orders at the end of August was $1.99 billion, up from $999.5 million at year's end.    ---                  August 1988      July 1988     August 1987      Comparative new orders for metal-cutting machines: Domestic ...... $179,300,000    $167,550,000    $90,250,000 Foreign ......... 82,200,000      19,450,000      6,100,000   Total ........ 261,500,000     187,000,000     96,350,000   8-month total for 1988: $1,791,250,000; for 1987: 863,850,000.
