The aide said Cools, 32, a physician with the Norwegian AidCommittee, was ``turned over'' to the leader of the Nasseritemilitia, Mustafa Saad, a Sunni Moslem. Saad's militia controlsSidon, 25 miles south of Beirut.   ``He is wearing spectacles and has a bushy beard. He's having ameeting with Saad right now,'' said Saad's aide, who spoke oncondition of anonymity.   Saad's aide said Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Robert Urbain;his chief aide, Robert Willermain; and Belgian Charge d'Affaireswere at Saad's residence when Cools arrived. Urbain and Willermainhad driven from Damascus, Syria, earlier in the day, apparentlyafter hearing about a statement from the kidnappers that Cools'release was imminent.   ``All of them are meeting with Saad. They'll leave later,probably for Damascus,'' he said.   Cools was kidnapped on May 21, 1988, near the Palestinian refugeecamp of Rashidiyeh, where he worked, on the outskirts of thesouthern port of Tyre.   A group calling itself Soldiers of Justice claimed reponsibilityand accused Cools of spying for Israel.   Cools' parents visited Sidon last month on the anniversary of hisabduction to appeal for his release.   The Soldiers of Justice, in a typewritten statement delivered toa Western news agency, said Wednesday that it would free Cools as agesture of good will and cited an appeal from Libyan leader Col.Moammar Gadhafi.   It also said the decision resulted from negotiations undertakenby Fatah-Revolutionary Council, the radical Palestinian guerrillafaction headed by terrorist mastermind Abu Nidal.   There has been widespread speculation in Lebanon that Cools wasabducted by Abu Nidal's group, despite its public disclaimers. Manyanalysts believe Soldiers of Justice is one of many names used bythe group.   There are now 14 foreigners, including nine Americans, missingand believed held hostage in Lebanon.   The longest held is American journalist Terry Anderson, chiefMiddle East correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnappedMarch 16, 1985.   Most of the hostages are believed held by pro-Iranian ShiiteMoslem extremist factions.   In a statement released on Wednesday, the Fatah-RevolutionaryCouncil praised the Soldiers of Justice for deciding to releaseCools.   It also pledged to ``spare no effort to help release other kidnapvictims, hoping European nations will help curb the Israelisuppression of our Palestinian people's uprising in the occupiedterritories.''   Nidal formed the council in 1976 after splitting a few yearsearlier from Yasser Arafat's mainstream Palestine LiberationOrganization.</TEXT></DOC>
