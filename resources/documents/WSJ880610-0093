Taylor (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> FIN BNK SCR </IN><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Federal Home Loan Bank Board proposed a rule designed to prevent misleading accounting practices that can hide losses within thrifts' securities portfolios.    The proposal would put pressure on thrifts to mark down the value of below-market securities that are held to trade or sell. Only securities held for long-term investment could be carried on their books at cost.    Under the rule, regulators would bar thrifts from putting their securities in the investment category unless they demonstrated both the intent and ability to keep them &quot;for the foreseeable future.&quot;    The rule could &quot;have a radical effect on the value of investment portfolios at savings institutions,&quot; said Thomas Vartanian, a former counsel to the Bank Board.    It would hit hardest at institutions that have large holdings of mortgage-backed securities and that trade them actively. Currently, few thrifts adjust their financial statements to reflect losses embedded in their securities portfolios, industry sources said.    The rule caught the industry's trade groups by surprise, but strong protests are expected. Mr. Vartanian said the proposal, approved at the first public Bank Board meeting in almost six months, &quot;may be the most significant and controversial regulatory action that will be taken this year.&quot;    Lawrence White, a Bank Board member, said the rule would discourage &quot;gains trading,&quot; by which a thrift will book profits by selling the best securities in its portfolio without disclosing losses on the rest.    If enacted, the rule would move thrift accounting closer to the methods used by bank regulatory agencies. But the proposal would give thrifts much more flexibility than banks have to justify trading in their long-term investment portfolios. Bank Board officials said thrifts require that flexibility because they often need such trades to hedge their interest-rate risk.    Thrifts are concerned about the paperwork required, according to officials at the U.S. League of Savings Institutions, the industry's largest trade group. They would have to draft detailed investment strategies to guide their classification of securities. And the accounting of each transaction would have to be justified according to the strategies. </TEXT></DOC>
