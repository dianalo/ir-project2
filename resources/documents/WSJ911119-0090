Last week the county collected a $100,000 check from thegroup's U.S. distributor, Arista Records, settling charges ofunfair competition and false advertising. It is the biggestconsumer-fraud award ever won by the district attorney ofYolo County -- population 141,092, annual budget $147.8million.</LP><TEXT>   Another $100,000 has been earmarked for a state fund thatsupports the prosecution of consumer cases.   Under the settlement, Arista and its New York parent,Bertelsmann Music Group Inc., a unit of Bertelsmann A.G.,admitted no wrongdoing. The California attorney general'soffice also signed on to the deal, guaranteeing that no otherstate law enforcement agency could bring any future actionsagainst the company. Nothing would prevent prosecutors inother states from doing so, however.   Arista has already been hit with at least 26 consumerfraud cases brought by people contending they were injured bythe dreadlocked German duo's false claims that they sang ontheir hit record. By settling with the Yolo districtattorney, lawyers for the record company say, they can arguethat -- at least as far as California is concerned -- thematter has been resolved and the other cases should bedismissed.   As for Yolo County, which assigned two investigators plusa deputy district attorney to buy Milli Vanilli records,tapes, compact disks and videos and make dozens oflong-distance phone calls to confirm the alleged fraud, theeffort appears to have paid off.   &quot;When you consider the amount of time we spent -- maybe 45hours or so -- and the money we recouped, I don't think youhave a problem with the taxpayers being upset,&quot; said deputydistrict attorney Mark Jones.</TEXT></DOC>
