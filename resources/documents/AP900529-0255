(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The long-delayed Seabrook plant lit uphomes with nuclear power for the first time Tuesday night asoperators began gearing up toward full operation, officials said.   The plant was operating at 15 percent capacity and producingabout 75 megawatts of electricity, enough to supply 65,000 homes,when it was connected to the New England power grid just after 8p.m., officials said.   The hookup occurred as part of a series of tests to ready theplant for full operation by mid-summer, spokesman Ron Sher said.   ``By making this initial connection ... we're now on our waytoward making a major contribution to New England's long-termenergy supplies,'' Edward Brown, president of plant operator NewHampshire Yankee, said in the news release.   Sher said the plant would produce electricity into the earlymorning hours and then be disconnected from the power grid soequipment can be tested. Operators will connect and disconnect thegenerator from the grid repeatedly during the next several weeks oftesting.   At full power, Seabrook will generate 1,150 megawatts, enough tosupply 1 million homes, New Hampshire Yankee has said.   The plant first produced electricity during tests in November1985, before it received an operating license, but that wasnon-nuclear power generated by the system's heater and pumps.   The $6.5 billion plant was licensed in March after years ofdelays. Opponents who claim the plant is unsafe and that thesurrounding area cannot be evacuated in an emergency have foughtthe reactor in the courts, through the regulatory process and inmass demonstrations since construction began in 1976.   The long delays and rising costs _ the original cost wasprojected at less than $1 billion _ forced its lead owner, PublicService Co. of New Hampshire, into bankruptcy court in January1988. Public Service is in the process of being taken over byNortheast Utilities of Connecticut.</TEXT></DOC>
