(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Sammy Davis Jr.'s health hasdeteriorated steadily since the cancer-stricken entertainer left ahospital eight weeks ago to recuperate at home, according to hisfriends.   Publicist Susan Reynolds would only say Davis was ``resting''and ``there has been no change.''

Davis' weight has dropped to about 60 pounds and he was in afetal position, a source close to the entertainer told TheAssociated Press on condition of anonymity. The source said he'd besurprised if the entertainer lived another week.   Reynolds would not comment on the report.

The source told the AP that stars visiting Davis come away``heartsick,'' some in tears.   Davis, 64, was released from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center onMarch 13 to recuperate at home. He was admitted mid-January fortreatment of a gum infection and doctors later found that he had arecurrence of throat cancer. No further chemotherapy was planned.   Davis was honored Sunday at a testimonial dinner by the Friendsof the Israel Defense Forces. In her brief acceptance, Davis' wife,Altovise, said: ``To try and say thank you is almost impossible.
