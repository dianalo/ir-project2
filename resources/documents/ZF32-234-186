 One reason is the growing number of personal computersand workstations that hook onto the data highways for accessing and sharinginformation.andM;Another reason is that, as computer applications become more complex, ittakes more bits and bytes to transmit the information via LANs.andO;Increasingly, workstations perform tasks which require frequent access to thenetwork to exchange large overhead as well as tapping into extremely largedatabases.andP;  Examples of such applications include aircraft flight simulation,color high-resolution graphics, and video imaging.andM;FDDI Applications And CharacteristicsandM;The new 100 megabits-per-second (100 mbps) Fiber Distributed Data Interface(FDDI) LAN is designed to enhance LAN performance.andP;  FDDI is a token-ring LANprotocol incorporating several layers of fault tolerance, fault isolation,and network management capabilities being developed as a standard by theAmerican National Standards Institute (ANSI) X3T9.5.andP;  As a high-speedbackbone bus, FDDI will act as:  (1) a bridge to lower speed LANS (e.g.,andO;Ethernet); (2) a bridge to FDDI backend rings interconnecting large,high-performance computers and disk drives; and (3) via data concentrators asa link to FDDI front-ends handling high-end workstations.andM;Falling costs of fiber-optic systems--currently $6,000 a node today butexpected to drop to $800 in the next few years--will make FDDI attractive ona price-performance basis.andP;  Ethernet typically costs $100 to $200 per nodetoday.andM;What Next-Generation FDDI Chips Should DeliverandM;Besides high speed, FDDI system requirements demand low power, highreliability, advanced network management features, and the smallest number ofcomponents as well as silicon processes that are compatible and scalable.andM;And for the future, a multi-chip solution should be able to be integratedinto one or two chips to meet cost and performance pressures.andP;  National'sFDDI chipset provides this kind of migration path through the use ofscalable, compatible processes.andM;National feels its next-generation, five-chip set provides performance,diagnostic capability, and functionality above and beyond the requirements ofthe FDDI standard.andM;For example, National's product incorporates a full-duplex architecture whichenables a loopback test feature that allows for transmission across the FDDIring.andM;Locked-In ReliabilityandM;National has drawn on its experience in analog technology to incorporate ananalog phased lock loop (PLL) circuit that has larger noise tolerancecapabilities.andP;  This translates into a lower bit error rate or betterreliability and quality of data being transmitted over the FDDI.andM;To achieve systems-level, mixed analog/digital solutions requires a varietyof capabilities.andP;  For example, with process technologies, for example.andP;  CMOSis the preferred process for FDDI because of its density and low power.andO;Although CMOS varies depending on the manufacturer, National feels itsproprietary M2CMOS is one of the few that can integrate high-performancelogic, memory and analog circuitry on the same chip.andM;BICMOS Is KeyandM;And because FDDI data rates are extremely high, silicon solutions alsorequire a process for interfacing particular circuitry with the fiber opticsthat combines a high-speed bipolar capability with low power consumption.andP;  Tomeet this requirement National uses its BICMOS (combined bipolar and CMOSprocess).andM;National's designers were able to analyze and incorporate importantsystem-level features into the FDDI chipset.andP;  Provided on-chip diagnosticfeatures include:andM;Multiple loopback paths that provide the ability to send data from a stationback to itself, as well as between individual chips, for chip-level faultisolationandM;-    Diagnostic counters that can analyze the work load onandM;the LAN to simplify network management and reduceandM;software overheadandM;-    An injection register that allows invalid symbols to beandM;purposely placed in the data stream for system- orandM;chip-level testingandM;-    Duplicate address and multiple token detection forandM;fault detectionandM;National's chipset also incorporates automatic generation of Beacon and Claimframes; automatic filtering of Beacon and Claim frames; and an &quot;elastic&quot;buffer memory that supports large chunks of back-to-back data.andM;To reduce board space by eliminating external logic parts, National's FDDIchipset features an on-chip switch to configure the bus for the type ofterminal on the LAN, eliminating external multiplexers and permittinglow-power system designs; on-chip counters that do away with externalcounters; and a physical interface to station management software.andM;FDDI LAN LabandM;One of the major reasons for a standard like FDDI or Ethernet isinteroperability--i.e., equipment and software from different vendorsfunctioning properly when brought together so that users can &quot;mix and match&quot;to suit their specific needs.andM;Because FDDI is new, high-performance, and fiber optic-based, National isworking closely with standards groups, computer manufacturers, softwaredevelopers, and potential customers to facilitate implementation of the LAN.andM;To ensure that a complex mix of LAN equipment and software work together,system integrators need to perform interoperability tests.andP;  Assembling all ofthe hardware and software, to conduct that testing outside the actualengineering or office environments, however, is difficult.andP;  To address thisissue, National has set up a dedicated FDDI LAN laboratory.andP;  The FDDI LAN labis equipped with computers, software and adapter boards from a variety ofmanufacturers that enable National engineers to assist customers by testingthe performance of individual components, including National's LAN chipsetsas well as entire systems.andM;ConclusionandM;FDDI represents an important technical opportunity for NationalSemiconductor, drawing on the company's extensive expertise in analog,digital, and mixed signal technologies.andP;  National believes that fewsemiconductor manufacturers come close to their capabilities.andM;With its expertise and resources, National provides a thorough technicalapproach to the FDDI standard.andP;  While others are still struggling to producetheir first generation  FDDI silicon, National is producing thenext-generation solution--a chipset that worked at first silicon.andM;For additional information on National Semiconductor Corporation'snext-generation FDDI chipset, contact Leslie Davis at NSC, 2900 SemiconductorDrive, P.O.
