(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>Hand-held scanners are rolled across a page to capture an image or to readcharacters into a PC.andP;  Although similar in function to tabletop scanners,they generally read smaller areas, cost less and are more flexible.andM;Graphic scanners are used in desktop publishing: some scanners also haveoptical-character recognition (OCR) ability, used mainly to read selectedexcerpts from existing documents.andM;Chicony IS-8105 Handy ScannerandM;Chicony America Inc.andM;The Chicony Handy Scanner is a good example of how a widely available basicscanner mechanism is turned into a unique finished product.andP;  ''Mitsumiprovides the wand,'' said Vince Montgomery, Chicony's sales manager, ''but weprovide the interface card and the driver software.'' The result is a scannerwith some elements common to other units and some unique differences.andM;At the scanner side, the Chicony unit features a 4-inch sensor with aresolution of 8 dots per millimeter (200 dots per inch).andP;  The hand-held unit,which resembles a wide mouse, plugs into a PC-bus interface card.andP;  A switchon the side of the unit selects either bitonal scanning (for OCR and lineart) or scanning with 16 levels of dithering (simulating gray tones by usingblack and white dots).andM;The unique hardware feature, said Montgomery, is the small size of theinterface card.andP;  Although equipped with the usual edge connector, it issmaller than even a half-card size, making it a good choice for portables andfor desktop machines that are short on space.andM;Distribution of the Chicony unit began only this month; no users could beidentified for this report.andM;Chicony America Inc. is located at 1641 W. Collins Ave., Orange, Calif.andO;92667 (714) 771-6151.andM;NiscanandM;Comar Systek Inc.andM;Just because the Niscan hand-held scanner looks somewhat similar to thosebuilt on generic engines, don't assume it's the same, warned product managerW.C.andP;  Frome.andP;  Although the Niscan unit is the same size and shape as thegeneric engines, Comar Systek builds its own scanner as well as its owninterface board, Frome said.andM;The Niscan hand scanner uses the 4.2-inch scanning width of most hand-heldmodels, with a software-selectable resolution of 100 or 200 dots per inch.andO;Material can be scanned at up to 2 inches per second.andP;  In dither mode, up toeight dither patterns can be applied to the 64 recognized gray levels.andP;  Infact, all parameters on the unit can be set in software, which is one featurethat distinguishes it from competitors, Frome said.andM;Comar Systek Inc. is located at 2693 Walnut Hill Lane, Suite 113, Dallas,Texas 75229 (214) 350-5088.andM;According to Users .andP;  .  .andM;''If you're looking to incorporate some good-looking artwork and some photosinto your work, it's a fine instrument,'' said Donald Fredericks, presidentof Accounting Decisions Inc., a financial consulting and services firm inMinneapolis.andP;  Fredericks said the improvement in his firm's newletters isappreciated by his clients.andM;Price was the main reason he chose a hand scanner, said Fredericks.andP;  ''It's agood way for people in business to gain entry and find out if it haspotential,'' he explained.andP;  While he'd like a larger scanning area and higherresolution, he said he's ''very pleased with the unit.''andM;Complete Hand Scanner CHS/400 Complete Half-Page Scanner CHPSandM;The Complete PCandM;''The Complete PC was the first company to ship hand scanners in the U.S.,''andO;claimed Lee Cannon, vice president of marketing for The Complete PC.andP;  Thefirm now has two hand-held scanners, the Complete Hand Scanner and theComplete Half-Page Scanner.andM;The Complete Hand Scanner is a smaller model, with a scanning width of 2.5inches.andP;  The maximum scanning rate is 2 inches per second, and the gray-scalemode can code for 16 levels of gray using three different dither patterns.andO;Resolution is user-selectable at 200, 300 and 400 dots per inch.andM;The unit is packaged with a software program called SmartScan, which allowsusers to resize, rotate, crop and edit images.andP;  Images can also be output inTIFF, PC Paintbrush (.PCX), Windows Paint (.MSP), Dr.andP;  HALO (.CUT) and GEM(.IMG) formats.andM;The Complete Half-Page Scanner is a similar but slightly larger unit thatscans images up to 4 inches wide at a resolution of 200 dots per inch.andP;  It isanother unit that started with a standard hardware base but has had uniquefeatures added, company officials said.andP;  ''We design and manufacture theinterface card and we do the software,'' said Barbara Weatherbee, productmarketing manager.andM;The Complete PC is located at 521 Cottonwood Drive, Milpitas, Calif.andP;  95035(408) 434-0145.andM;According to Users .andP;  .  .andM;''It was low-cost, and the size is easy to move around to use,'' said AnnMarshall of San Jose, Calif., an early purchaser of the scanner.andP;  Marshallsaid it was easy to install and to use.andP;  In addition, when teamed with aprinter, it serves as a low-cost copier, she said.andP;  ''If you need a quickcopy, you can scan something.andP;  If we need a copy of a check, we just scanit,'' she reported.andM;Diamond Flower HandyandM;Scanner HS-2000andM;Diamond Flower ElectricandM;Instrument Co.andP;  The Diamond Flower Handy Scanner is another combination ofstock engine and custom interface.andP;  The basic performance model includes a4.2-inch-wide scanning swath and a resolution of 100, 200 or 300 dots perinch (400-dpi resolution is also possible, when interpolated from 200-dpidata).andP;  An optional green scanning color allows it to scan more effectivelycolored images that include reds.andM;Software support includes Diamond Flower's Scan program, plus a copy of MediaCybernetics Inc.'s Dr.andP;  HALO Desktop Publishing Edition.andP;  The latter is afull-featured paint program that allows users to edit scanned images beforeprinting them or exporting them to other applications.andM;Diamond Flower is also the publisher of OCR software for scanners, calledCarets, which will be available as an option on the Handy Scan early thisyear.andM;Diamond Flower Electric Instrument Co. is located at 2544 Port St., WestSacramento, Calif.andP;

 Erickson, who is scanningpublic-domain art for use in publications, said the software included withthe Handy Scanner was particulary helpful.andP;  ''It's a good front end forPageMaker and Ventura [Publisher].''andM;For gray-scale work, Erickson continued, he does notice that the hand-heldscanner's output isn't as precise as a flatbed scanner's, ''but we find theresults reasonably pleasing.'' He's also happy with Diamond Flower as avendor.andP;  ''From a support and service viewpoint, they have an excellentservice staff.''andM;GeniScan GS-2000 PlusandM;KYE International Corp.andM;KYE, the maker of the popular Genius Mouse, is another manufacturer thatdistinguishes its hand-held scanner by implementation details, support anddistribution.andP;  The hardware, based on a standard engine, provides 4-inch-widescanning at 100, 200, 300 and 400 dots per inch; it uses a half-card formatadapter.andM;The software in the package includes KYE's Genius ScanEdit, Dr. HALO III andStudio Software Corp.'s Front Page Personal Publisher.andP;  ScanEdit, companyofficials claim, is the only scanner-control program in which text andgraphics can be overlapped transparently, and where scanning, sizing andshading can take place in multiple windows.andM;The program supports many 9- and 24-pin matrix and laser printers.andP;  Imagescan also be exported to most popular desktop-publishing programs.andM;KYE provides direct technical support for ScanEdit users, and maintains abulletin board containing any updated or added drivers.andP;  The GeniScan comeswith a lifetime warranty.andM;KYE International Corp. is located at 769 Pinefalls Ave., Walnut, Calif.andO;91789 (714) 594-9234.andM;According to Users .andP;  .  .andM;GeniScan's biggest attraction, said Charles Schaffer, a biological consultantin San Pedro, Calif., was its convenience.andP;  ''I like to keep to outboardunits as much as possible.'' Overall, he said, ''I like what it does, andit's very easy to use.''andM;As a user of many different add-on units, however, he has occasionally hadsome problems.andP;  ''I thought it was having problems the other day, but itturned out it was an analog to digital board on the same address.''andM;Schaffer said he was able to remedy a regular distortion that initiallyplagued some of his images.andP;  ''If you draw the scanner down at a slow butconstant speed, circles come out as elipses.'' The cure, he said, is to scanat the correct speed.andP;  ''It doesn't take long to learn what the speed shouldbe.''andM;ScanManandM;Logitech Inc.andM;Logitech is focusing on software, support and product quality to make itsScanMan hand-held scanner stand out among the competition.andM;On the hardware side, ScanMan is fairly standard, with a 4-inch-wide scanningwindow and a 200-dot-per-inch resolution.andM;Logitech Inc. is located at 6505 Kaiser Drive, Fremont, Calif.andP;  94555 (415)795-8500.andM;According to Users .andP;  .  .andM;''I'm trying to learn desktop publishing,'' said Dennis Alexander, a civilianemployee of the U.S.andP;  Army in Chambersburg, Pa.andP;  Because of the ScanMan'sconvenience and price, Alexander said, he could afford to buy a scanner ofhis own to try to get up to speed before the scheduled introduction of adesktop-publishing system in a few months.andP;  ''If I could have gotten awhole-page scanner, I would have,'' he admitted.andP;  However, he said, thetraining he's getting now could make a large difference in his worksituation.andM;The ScanMan has been ''the cat's meow'' for Terry Smith, president ofchemical maker CDI Inc., in Auburn, Wash.andP;  ''We do a weekly newsletter forour salespeople,'' he explained.andM;''We didn't have a need for a full-page scanner,'' Smith said.andP;  ''Basically,what we had to scan fell well within the realm of the hand scanner.''andM;His material is usually product illustrations from manufacturers' cataloguesor art from trade-association publications.andM;The main limitation of the unit, he said, was its software.andP;  ''It does nothave a rotation feature.andP;  It does not have a resizing feature.andP;  We've learnedto live with it, but they claim they're taking care of it.''andM;MarqSystemandM;Marq TechnologiesandM;The MarqSystem is a modular input device that serves as a mouse, imagescanner and OCR reader all in one.andP;  The basic mouse, which features atracking resolution at double the level common in the industry, is availablenow.andP;  The add-on MarqScanner and MarqReader units will be shipped in thefirst quarter of the year.andM;Marq officials claim that the device, when configured as a scanner, willdeliver 300-dpi output as 16 gray levels per dot.andP;  This represents''near-photographic quality, with the equivalent resolution of a 1,200-dpioutput device,'' they said.andM;When configured as an OCR reader, the Marq system will use a topologicalrecognition system that will, according to the company, ''solve traditional,common recognition problems such as proportional spacing, restricted typestyles, and multiple-font types and sizes on one page.''andM;''This is the first product of this kind,'' affirmed Jennifer Mitchell,senior industry analyst at Dataquest Inc., a market-research firm in SanJose, Calif.andP;  However, she said, it is not yet clear whether the particularconfiguration that Marq Technologies has chosen will find favor with users.andO;''It's up to the market to decide,'' Mitchell said.andM;Marq Technologies is located at Nancy Ridge Drive, San Diego, Calif.andP;  92121(619) 452-4248.andM;SP-MH216AFandM;Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc.andM;The Mitsubishi SP-MH216AF is a full-page-wide convertible scanner.andP;  Byitself, it can be rolled down a page manually to scan a swath up to 8-1/2inches wide, or it can be combined with an optional paper feeder toconstitute a roll-fed unit.andM;According to Gary Holtorf, product manager, the unit is ''compact andlightweight for desktop use, compared to a flatbed scanner, which is roughlythe size of a laser printer.'' It is ''the only full-page-wide hand-heldscanner we know about,'' he said.andM;Resolution is 200 dots per inch, and up to 16 levels of gray can be simulatedwith a 4-by-4-dot dither pattern.andP;  Scans can be up to 14 inches long, ifsufficient memory is available (including expanded memory).andP;  Images can alsobe buffered to the hard disk, taking up to 1.2M bytes.andM;The unit is fast, Holtorf said, scanning a full-sized page in 19 seconds.andO;The SP-MH216AF comes with utility software that allows images to be saved inTIFF or .PCX file formats, the formats needed for most popular paint,desktop-publishing and OCR software.andP;  ''We're working with softwaredevelopers to incorporate drivers directly into their packages,'' saidHoltorf.andM;We were unable to locate users in time for this report.andM;Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc. is located at 991 Knox St., Torrance,Calif.andP;  90502 (213) 217-5732.andM;Pocket Scanner PBPS-1000andM;Packard BellandM;The Packard Bell PBPS-1000 is a standard, mouse-shaped scanner, with ascanning width of 64mm (about 2.5 inches).andP;  Resolution is 200 dots per inch.andO;It hooks up to a PC with a half-slot, 5-inch-long adapter card, which alsosupplies the power for the scanner.andM;Packard Bell includes a menu-driven scanner program to capture images anddisplay them on-screen.andP;  Images longer than the screen height can be scrolledfor viewing.andP;  Files are saved in the TIFF format.andM;Packard Bell officials said the scanner is sold through distributors anddealers, and therefore the user names were not available to Packard Bell.andM;Packard Bell is located at 9425 Canoga Ave., Chatsworth, Calif.andP;  91311 (818)716- 2727.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
