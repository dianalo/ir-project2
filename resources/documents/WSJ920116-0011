The company, which designs and manages self-fundedemployee benefit programs for smaller companies, said netincome for the quarter ended Nov. 30 slipped to $2.8 million,or 34 cents a share, from the year-earlier $4.4 million, or61 cents a share.</LP><TEXT>   The year-ago period was boosted by a $2 million, or 27cents a share tax benefit; excluding that item, the latestquarter's earnings rose 16%, and per-share earnings were flatwith the year-earlier period.   That performance -- which reflects an increase in thenumber of shares outstanding to 8.2 million from 7.1 million-- came despite a 40% increase in revenue, to $53.4 millionfrom $38.2 million.   Analysts had been expecting higher revenue, and per-shareearnings of 45 to 48 cents, until the company's recentdisclosure that it expected 34 cent-a-share second-quarterresults. Employee Benefit shares, which had recently surgedupward to the low $60s, plunged $30.125 to $30.375 in thesession following that news. The shares have since registereda modest further decline: In late composite New York StockExchange trading yesterday, EBP was quoted at $26.75, off$2.125.   Employee Benefit also said that two separate shareholderlawsuits alleging violation of securities laws had been filedagainst the company in the wake of the stock's big decline.
