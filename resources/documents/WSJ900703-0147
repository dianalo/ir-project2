Aides to the ANC leader gave details of the extensive butlittle-known support Cuba has rendered to the anti-apartheidstruggle in South Africa. In interviews last week, the aidesalso talked about the ANC's more limited relationship withLibya's Moammar Gadhafi and with Yasser Arafat of thePalestine Liberation Organization.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. Mandela's positive comments about these three foreignleaders were the only blemishes on his otherwise successfuleight-city tour of the U.S., which ended Saturday. He raiseda considerable amount in private donations for the ANC duringthe visit. But some members of Congress said his favorablecomments about Mr. Castro, which upset anti-Castro Cubans,about Mr. Arafat, which unsettled Jews, and about Mr.Gadhafi, whose support of terrorism angers many Americans,would make it more difficult to get the $50 million in U.S.aid Mr. Mandela is seeking.   Mr. Mandela explained publicly that the ANC forged tieswith Cuba in 1960, when, on a trip to the West, ANC leadersreceived a promise of anti-apartheid aid from Cuba but nosuch promise from the U.S. In the years that followed, Cuba'ssupport for the ANC was mostly educational, including medicaltraining. &quot;The largest number of doctors we have was trainedin Cuba,&quot; said Thambo Mbeki, the ANC's director ofinternational relations.   But after the 1976 uprising in Soweto, during whichstudents protesting the apartheid educational system wereshot down by South African government forces, Cuba beganmilitary training for the ANC, said Patford Shuma, a memberof Mr. Mandela's U.S. traveling delegation.   Mr. Castro indirectly assisted the ANC by providing troopsto help defend Angola from rebels backed by South Africa andthe U.S. After it won independence in 1975, Angola allowedANC training camps to operate there; continuing Cubanmilitary assistance helped protect the ANC camps in Angolaand facilitated ANC armed actions against South Africa, Mr.Shuma said.   &quot;It was a very, very safe rear base for us,&quot; he added.&quot;The Cubans really helped us a lot.&quot;   The ANC's ties with Mr. Arafat, brought to life in aphotograph of Mr. Mandela and Mr. Arafat embracing, have alsobeen controversial in the U.S. But unlike the ANC's ties toCuba, &quot;the relationship with the PLO is purely political,&quot;said Thomas Nkobi, the ANC's treasurer-general. Because ofmilitary links between South Africa and Israel, Mr. Nkobisaid, &quot;We feel we are fighting a common enemy.&quot;   An October 1989 study by the United Nations Center AgainstApartheid describes years of close military ties betweenSouth Africa and Israel, including cooperation on thedevelopment of a nuclear-capable intermediate-range ballisticmissile -- a modification of Israel's Jericho II. The reportasserts that Israel also has helped upgrade the Mirage III, aSouth African fighter jet, and that it has provided refuelingaircraft that extended the range of South African spy planesto Tanzania.   The Israeli consul general in Chicago, Uri Bar-Ner, saidthat Israel is now &quot;in an accelerated pace of disengagement&quot;from military cooperation with South Africa. Israel'scollaboration was done &quot;for survival, not for profit-making,&quot;he added. During his U.S. tour, Mr. Mandela placed the ANCfirmly behind Israel's right to exist, but in opposition toits occupation of captured Arab territory.   The ANC's relationship with Mr. Gadhafi, whom Mr. Mandelacalled a &quot;brother leader,&quot; is a new one. Indeed, Mr. Mandelanoted that Mr. Gadhafi until last February refused to let theANC open offices in Libya because of the involvement of SouthAfrican Jews in the anti-apartheid group. Before that, theANC had a distant relationship with Mr. Gadhafi, whosupported the Pan Africanist Congress, a liberation movementthat broke away from the ANC.   In May, Mr. Mandela visited Libya and received $250,000 inaid for the ANC from the Gadhafi government, Mr. Nkobi said.</TEXT></DOC>
