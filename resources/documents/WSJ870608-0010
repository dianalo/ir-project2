The mark has been among the stronger non-dollar currencies in recent weeks, and traders see upward pressure on it intensifying. Reasons include international investment flows, speculative buying and perhaps even a shared U.S.-Japanese willingness to see the mark climb.    &quot;The mark will be considerably more volatile than the yen over the next several weeks,&quot; Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, predicts.    In late New York trading Friday, the mark was quoted at 1.8179 to the dollar. It stood at 1.7635 to the dollar May 4, meaning the U.S. currency strengthened by 3.1% against the mark in the past month.    But traders are drawing their conclusions from a different rate: the mark-yen exchange rate. The mark and yen in recent years often moved in tandem against the dollar. But since late April, the mark has strengthened 1.4% against the yen. That followed a seven-month downward trend in the mark's value against the Japanese currency.    With Japan's Ministry of Finance having clamped down lately on Tokyo traders' speculation against the dollar, some dealer attention has turned to the mark instead.    &quot;The Japanese government and the Bank of Japan are really sitting on their traders&quot; to stem dollar-selling, Mr. Kellner says. Some of the volatility in the mark-yen rate, he says, could be the result of Japanese traders &quot;using that as an instrument rather than the dollar-yen.&quot;    Political factors also are contributing to the interest in the mark. In recent weeks, Japan has responded to some of the Reagan administration's calls for a more stimulative domestic economic policy. Thus, many traders now expect the U.S. to shift its attention to West Germany and urge similar actions to increase economic growth there.    &quot;From the U.S. perspective, the Japanese have clearly done something to address the trade deficit,&quot; a top foreign-exchange dealer in New York says. &quot;In contrast, the Germans have done relatively nothing.&quot;    James T. McGroarty, vice president, foreign exchange, at Discount Corp. of New York, says, &quot;If the administration says they want the West Germans to cooperate more, then the market is going to think the dollar is going down against the mark.&quot; Exchange rates, he says, have been the Reagan administration's favorite tool in seeking policy changes from its allies.    Carmine J. Rotondo, vice president and chief corporate dealer in New York at Security Pacific National Bank, says: &quot;The market realizes that the Japanese have done what they should be doing. Now the market is looking at the West Germans and what they've done. So far, they've done nothing.&quot;    Some traders who expect a stronger mark figure that the economic summit this week in Venice could provide a chance for the U.S. to press its case with West Germany.    &quot;At the last summit, the focus was on the Japanese. Now we're going to call on the Germans to do their part,&quot; Mr. Rotondo says.    Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co., says Japan may be helping boost the mark against the yen.    &quot;I heard it was a deliberate effort by the Japanese,&quot; he says, &quot;to improve Japanese exports to Germany and to Europe in general.&quot;    The Bank of Japan generally doesn't comment on such speculation.    Still another factor aiding the mark, traders say, is the movement of funds by big Japanese investors into West German and other European financial markets. Japanese investors are reported to be especially attracted to the West German bond market; interest rates are higher than in Japan, and inflation in West Germany is practically nonexistent right now.    Within Europe as well, nervousness ahead of Thursday's British election has caused some investors to move out of British pounds and into marks. Political uncertainties in Italy and France also may be boosting the mark.    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar ended lower in dull, directionless trading as dealers retreated to the sidelines ahead of this week's Venice summit of the U.S. and its six major allies.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 143.98 yen, compared with 144.38 late Thursday. The U.S. currency also slipped to 1.8179 marks from 1.8195.    Dealers said the market shrugged off news that U.S. civilian unemployment was unchanged at 6.3% in May and that non-farm payrolls rose 123,000. The market had been generally expecting an unemployment rate of 6.4% and a payroll rise of about 214,000.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery rose 70 cents an ounce to $453.80 in light trading. Estimated volume was two million ounces.    Gold was quoted at $454.25 an ounce in early trading Monday in Hong Kong.    ---                     LATE NEW YORK TRADING                      Friday, June 5, 1987    Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
