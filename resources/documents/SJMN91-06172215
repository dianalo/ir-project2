Nevertheless, I insisted that our son &quot;John&quot; have a first-rateeducation. His mother, who lived in a $250,000 home in Sarasota, refused tohelp him. John and I talked it over and he agreed to repay me when he was ablesince I have no retirement benefits and won't be able to work forever.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Living  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  LEND WITH NO PROOF, KISS MONEY GOODBYE  </HEADLINE><TEXT>     During his four years of college and two additional years earning anM.B.A., he wrote often to express his gratitude and reaffirm his promise torepay me when he could.;    John became an investment banker, and now, at theage of 32, is vice president of one of the biggest firms on Wall Street. Heshowed no interest in spending time with me after he left school and failed toreturn my phone calls. After years of trying, without success, to re-establishcommunication, I decided to sue him for the money I had spent to put himthrough school. The court decided that since there was no agreement in&quot;legally enforceable form&quot; his letters acknowledging his obligation andpromises to pay were meaningless.;    The lesson is as follows: If you want tobe sure you can collect, no matter what the nature of the debt, run it by alawyer.;    -- Rockville Centre, N.Y.;    DEAR ROCK -- Your story is a sad oneand not uncommon. Read on:;    From Charleston, S.C.: The letter you printedfrom the Seattle woman whose daughter and son-in-law borrowed $125,000 to gointo business and refused to pay it back described exactly what happened tome, only it was $150,000 and the borrowers were two nephews whom my wife and Ihad practically raised.;    When I told my wife I thought we should ask theseyoung men to sign a note, she said, &quot;Don't insult them. They are as honest asthe day is long.&quot; Well, you can guess the rest. Although the business did verywell, they made no effort to repay us. After a few years they phoned tosuggest that I write it off as a &quot;bad loan&quot; and take a tax deduction.;    --Charleston, S.C.;    Can you use another letter about getting stuck by arelative? It was my daughter who ripped me off. Before I went to the hospitalfor serious surgery I gave her power of attorney. Much to her surprise, Ilived through the operation and made a remarkable comeback. Good news? Notexactly. During my recovery, my daughter went into two oil and gas deals (withmy money) and damn near wiped me out. There's a lesson here.;    -- Venezuela;   When it comes to co-signing or lending money, I am a strong advocate of the&quot;kiss principle.&quot; Here it is: &quot;Never loan money to anyone unless you arewilling to kiss it goodbye.&quot;;    -- Purchase, N.Y.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ann Landers column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910620  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Thursday  </DAY><MONTH>  June  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  516  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Thursday June 20, 199100172215,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
