Iran's leaders and Shiite leaders in Lebanon have often demandedthat the United States urge Israel to release 350 Moslem prisonersheld in Israel and in Israel's self-declared security zone insouthern Lebanon.   However, it was the first time in some months that an Iranianleader referred to 15 Shiite Moslems jailed in Kuwait in 1984 forcar bombings in that country that killed five people and wounded 86.   Two American educators, Robert Polhill and Frank Reed, werereleased by their pro-Iranian kidnappers at Tehran's bidding inApril, and Iran said Washington should make a gesture in return.   ``An appropriate response was expected after the Lebaneseunconditionally set free the hostages _ release of hostages inKuwait and Israel,'' Rafsanjani said without elaborating.   ``Why don't you help increase the necessary public pressure onthose governments to release these hostages, so that the Westernhostages can be freed in return?'' the Iranian president asked thejournalists.   ``If the United States is serious about wanting relations withIran in the future, it must begin to act, because talking is notenough,'' he added.   Polhill and Reed were the first U.S. captives to be released in3{ years. Six Americans are among the 16 Westerners still held bypro-Iranian kidnappers in Lebanon. The longest-held is TerryAnderson, chief Middle East correspondent for the Associated Press,who was abducted in March 1985.   Rafsanjani also said he did not rule out a peace summit withPresident Saddam Hussein of Iraq. But he said that will happen onlyafter lower-level Iraqi-Iranian meetings are held to discussreaching a permanent settlement to the Persian Gulf war, which endedin a cease-fire in August 1988.   Referring to Iran's death threats against British author SalmanRushdie, he said ties with London could be resumed if Prime MinisterMargaret Thatcher condemns his book ``The Satanic Verses.'' But hesaid there was no question of lifting the death decree on Rushdie,whose book Iran says defames Islam.   Rafsanjani said Iran's policy was ``to help secure the release ofall the hostages, whether they be Western, Lebanese or Iranian.''   The Iranian president reiterated his country's claim that fourIranians _ two diplomats, a journalist and a driver _ who werekidnapped by the Christian Lebanese Forces militia in 1982 are stillalive.   ``We have learned officially from a government, and from reliablesources in east Beirut, that the Iranian hostages are alive,''Rafsanjani said. ``The special envoy of a certain government hasinformed us.''   He did not identify the country.   The Bush administration recently provided Iran with informationthrough the Swiss government which it said indicated the four menhad been killed.   Sources in the Lebanese Forces have said the Iranians were killedsoon after they were seized. Rafsanjani has said repeatedly that ifthe West wants help in releasing hostages, it must help determinethe fate of the four.</TEXT></DOC>
