Independent grading services, which have been rating and encapsulating coins since 1986, have made rare coins &quot;more of a commodity,&quot; says Keith Zaner of Coin World newspaper. That's allowing people to buy coins sight unseen. &quot;It's starting to attract major money,&quot; says John Albanese, president of Numismatic Guaranty Corp., a Parsippany, N.J., grading service, citing formation of at least two multimillion-dollar limited partnerships. The next step: Wall Street, says John Sack of Shearson Lehman Hutton. &quot;I firmly believe rare coins will be traded daily on Wall Street soon.&quot;    But the coin market remains small -- only $3 billion in sales a year -- and very sensitive to big trades, says Scott Travers, a New York dealer. He partly blames recent softening of this year's red-hot market on a major investor's decision to shift emphasis and sell his collection. Even $100 million is &quot;very substantial&quot; in this field, he says.    The move to big money hurts some players. &quot;Little guys on the corner are going out of business,&quot; Mr. Sack says.    RELAXED HUNTING LAWS become a weapon against growing deer problems.    With more deer munching crops, orchards and suburban landscaping, states have begun relaxing their hunting laws. Georgia extended its season for killing does. &quot;We've found it's the only way to keep the population down,&quot; says Joseph Kurz of the state game-management office. Connecticut lengthened its hunting seasons and permits more kills, making it the most liberal deer-hunting state in New England, says Jim Spignesi of the state's wildlife bureau. New York proposes laws to allow more kills.    But problems remain. Pennsylvania cites lack of interest from once-enthusiastic hunters. &quot;It used to be that a hunter would go out and hunt every day. Now they don't take many days off work to hunt,&quot; says Ted Godshall of the state's game commission. Officials in Connecticut and New York hold town meetings to encourage landowners to open their property to hunters. Hunting alternatives are costly: Some Pittsburgh suburbs trap deer with tranquilizers and nets at an estimated cost of $300 a deer.    FINANCIAL PRINTERS struggle to recover from last year's stock-market crash.    Having increased press capacity during the equity-issue boom of the early 1980s, financial printers are suffering from the drop-off in stock offerings. Sorg Inc., which reported a loss of $4.2 million in the year ended May 31, has laid off close to 150 employees, says David Rosenstein, a vice president. &quot;With filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission down sharply, we're still hurting from the crash.&quot;    For financial printers hoping to survive, diversification is a must because &quot;this cyclical business may never return to pre-crash levels,&quot; says Mark Witmer, analyst for Wessels, Arnold andamp; Henderson. Merrill Corp., Minneapolis, shifts to photocopying for attorneys and printing newsletters for thrifts, hospitals and TV stations. &quot;Non-financial printing now accounts for about 15% of our sales and may eventually rise to 50%,&quot; says John Castro, president.    But non-financial printing's profit margins can be 25% to 40% lower than financial printing's, Mr. Witmer says.    AUTHOR, AUTHOR: Each visitor to New York's World Trade Center during the week of Oct. 31 can write one sentence of &quot;The Great American Novel.&quot; Sponsored by penmaker Montblanc, the novel will be submitted to the Guinness Book of World Records for having the most authors.    RADIATION DETECTORS find a market after disclosure of mishaps at the Savannah River nuclear-weapons plant in South Carolina. Since the news broke three weeks ago, total orders of a new home detector from Unique Products Inc., Reno, Nev., have jumped to $2.5 million from $250,000.    HEAVY SMOKERS are different from light smokers, and they also stay away from smoking studies. So Stanford University is offering people who smoke 25 cigarettes or more a day $100 to stay smoke-free for 24 hours. It hopes to attract 2,800 smokers.    OLD APPLIANCES become a major disposal headache.    Concern about PCBs in the capacitors of some old appliances has many scrap-metal processors refusing these items. &quot;This is a very serious problem,&quot; particularly in areas where landfill space is tight, says Robert McCarty of New York's waste reduction and recycling bureau. Tops Appliance City Inc., a New Jersey chain, removes 200 old appliances a day and now must truck them to Maryland to get rid of them. &quot;We may reach a point when we are going to have to stop removing appliances,&quot; says Sam Rozenberg, vice president of operations. That, he says, would reduce sales.    The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it didn't create the turmoil; it simply reminded scrap processors this summer of the agency's PCB-disposal policy. But scrap processors say they don't want the liability unless the EPA exempts appliance waste. The latest round: The EPA sends out letters stating that most appliances don't contain PCB capacitors.    Since PCBs weren't used in appliances after 1979, the problem will eventually diminish, Mr. McCarty says.    BRIEFS: For $25, Fidelity Services of San Francisco will notify friends and family in the event of a client's untimely death. . . . To recruit employees, Batesville Casket Co., Batesville, Ind., sends videotapes to 40 colleges, stressing the high-tech and robotic side of the business. </TEXT></DOC>
