The Nasdaq Composite Index fell 1.24, or 0.34%, to 359.00-- its fifth consecutive drop this year. Declining issues,meanwhile, outpaced advancers, 1,005 to 742.</LP><TEXT>   Lance Zipper, manager of over-the-counter trading atKidder Peabody andamp; Co., said yesterday's session was similar totrading over the past several days -- characterized by lowvolume and a lack of investor interest.   Concern about the Persian Gulf situation and trepidationahead of Tuesday's United Nations' deadline for Iraqiwithdrawal from Kuwait have kept investors on the sidelines,traders say.   Unlisted stocks got a temporary boost at midday by theFederal Reserve Board's apparent move to allow the federalfunds rate to decline to 6 3/4% from a previous target of 7%.   But over-the-counter stocks were unable to pull themselvesinto positive territory on the development and spent the restof the day drifting at lower levels.   While New York Stock Exchange shares did move aboveMonday's closing level following the Fed's move, theexchange's Composite Index closed down 0.46, or 0.27%, andthe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed off 13.36, or 0.53%.   Meanwhile, unlisted shares also ignored an easing in crudeoil prices. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the Februarycontract for crude oil fell 48 cents, to $27.17 a barrel.   Tony Cecin, director of equity trading at Piper, Jaffray andamp;Hopwood in Minneapolis, said people are using next Tuesday'sU.N. deadline &quot;as a reason not to do anything.&quot;   He said: &quot;Until people have a clearer understanding ofwhat they are looking at down the road they will probablyjust keep their hands in their pockets.&quot;   Leslie Seff, head of OTC trading at Gruntal andamp; Co., saidMiddle East nervousness is being compounded by economicconcerns.   He said last Sunday's federal seizure of Bank of NewEngland and yesterday's bankruptcy-law filing by Pan Am areputting an added crimp on investor sentiment. Although sharesof both of those concerns trade on the Big Board, Mr. Seffsaid the effects spill over into the OTC market.
