The Mountain View, Calif., microchip and computer-parts maker had third-quarter net income of $1.3 million, or 15 cents a share, on revenue of $34.5 million.    Scientific Micro said it will report fourth-quarter revenue of between $33 million and $34.5 million.    In its year-ago fourth period, it had net of $309,000, or four cents a share, on revenue of $17.6 million. Industry analysts had expected this year's fourth-quarter results to match those of the third quarter.    A Scientific Micro spokesman declined to be more specific about the company's expected profit drop.    He did say production was hampered in the period by claims by IBM, Armonk, N.Y., that Scientific Micro's &quot;BIOS&quot; software system violated IBM copyrights. The spokesman said the conflict was resolved, after a period of &quot;reassessment.&quot; The BIOS program controls the flow of data into and out of computers.    Scientific Micro also tied the earnings fall to production delays caused by technical modifications, including efforts to bring products into compliance with U.S. radiation standards for computing equipment. It also said output was slowed from difficulties in obtaining microprocessor chips for IBM-compatible computers.    &quot;We believe that we have corrected the majority of the causes of the delays,&quot; said Charles Mathews, Scientific Micro's president and chief executive officer.    In national over-the-counter trading Thursday, Scientific Micro closed at $4.875 a share, down 12.5 cents. </TEXT></DOC>
