 As noted in our opening remarks, the drama, confusion andconfrontation of the September Conference were superceded by a remarkablycalm and rational (although still competitive) atmosphere.andP;  It is obviousthat everyone concerned has been very hard at work in the intervening time,and the results promise real benefits to everyone in the industry.andM;Background.andP;  The war over outline font technology erupted into publicconsciousness at the Seybold Desktop Publishing Conference in September,1988.andP;  Two facts had become painfully apparent.andP;  First, font rasterizing wassimultaneously the key to acceptable 300-dpi print quality and the hardestpart of a PostScript interpreter.andM;Second, unless you had absolutely identical fonts on all machines, you didnot have true advice independence.andP;  Since device independence was one of themost attractive features of a page description language, this posed a seriousproblem.andP;  Differences in character widths could change the position of lineendings and consequently would move page breaks or upset the careful fittingof copy to layouts.andP;  Differences in character shape could alter clippingpaths and fail to render artwork accurately.andM;The problem was especially serious for the graphic arts world, where it wasfirst noticed, because designers and printers are trained to focus on thefidelity of print reproduction.andP;  But it was just as big a problem for thecomputer industry, though the computer industry was slower to realize it.andO;Just as you cannot reliably print a document unless the printer and thedesigner have the same fonts, you cannot send a formatted document from onecomputer screen to another unless the same fonts are available on both.andP;  Aselectronic document interchange became more and more a requirement, thecomputer industry began to sit up and take notice.andM;Screens too.andP;  At that same Conference, it became apparent that 300-dpi laserprinter output was only the beginning of the problem.andP;  Display of trueWYSIWYG fonts on a 72-, 85- or 100-dpi desktop computer screen was going tobe an even bigger (and more difficult) problem.andM;Apple was roasted by Conference attendees for contending that users do notneed scalable outline fonts for screen display and the bitmap fonts in arange of commonly used sized are quite sufficient for most needs.andP;  Users whohad struggled with the limitations of bitmap screen fonts were not buying theargument.andP;  Apple left the Conference with a quiet resolve to make developmentof its own outline font technology a higher priority.andM;Adobe the villain.andP;  Adobe was also on the hot seat.andP;  The PostScript clonevendors had belatedly discovered that their machines were not trulyAdobe-compatible if they could not use Adobe fonts.andP;  Despite fierce pressurefrom the audience, Adobe refused to make its encrypted.andP;  Type 1 font formatand its font technology public.andP;  Just like the dedicated typesetter vendorsof yore, it regarded its font library and font technology as importantprotection against clones.andM;March 1989.andP;  At the Seybold Seminars last year, Apple announced that itwould, in fact, include scalable outline font technology in future release ofthe Macintosh operating system.andP;  Characteristically, Apple indicated that itwas inventing its own scaling technology as an in-house project.andP;  Thisproject was later announced under its code name, &quot;Royal.&quot;andP;  Apple promisedthat Royal would combine the best features of all known font scaling systems,including a highly generalized system of hints that would allow good-qualityrendering on laser printers, dot-matrix printers and even computer screens.andM;Microsoft, having taken the reaction to Apple's earlier position to heart,announced at the March Seminars that it, too, would build outline fontscaling technology into its operating environment.andP;  In contrast to Apple, itsaid that it would license an existing technology.andM;This announcement launched a search process to decide on which of theavailable font technologies Microsoft would build into its operating systemsoftware.andP;  Microsoft stated that it would only consider a system that wascompact, was fast, and had an open font specification.andP;  Since everyoneassumed that whatever Microsoft chose would automatically become a de factostandard, all of the vendors of font technology were anxious to be the luckybride.andP;  Compugraphic (Intellifont), Bitstream (Speedo), The Company (NimbusQ), Sun (Folio) and even Adobe vied for the honor--and the commercialadvantage that would accompany it.andM;Adobe began to respond to the pressure by signing deals with Compugraphic andMonotype to add their faces to the Adobe font library.andP;  But there was adisquieting undercurrent: both Apple and Microsoft gave indications of movingaway from PostScript towards using their own respective imaging models foroutput as well as screen display.andP;  (More on this in a moment.)andM;May 1989.andP;  A number of events in May helped set the stage for the crisis thatwas to come.andP;  Microsoft acquired Bauer Enterprises and its PostScript clone.andO;Apple publicly announced its Royal font technology project.andP;  The week beforethe Apple announcement, Adobe announced ATM (Adobe Type Manager).andP;  This was adirect challenge to Apple, since ATM was also designed to generate on-the-flyMacintosh screen display, using widely available Adobe outline fonts.andM;September 1989.andP;  Shortly after the March Seminars, Microsoft had decided thatit would announce its font technology decision at the next Seybold Conferencein September.andP;  When the announcement came, it took a direction that fewpeople had expected: rather than one of the candidates listed above,Microsoft had cut a deal with Apple under which Apple would use the Microsoft(Bauer) PostScript clone, while Microsoft would adopt the Apple Royal fonttechnology and font library.andM;The announcement of the Microsoft-Apple alliance caused on uproar.andP;  It wasobvious that the two vendors controlled virtually the entire desktopcomputing business by virtue of supplying the Macintosh and MS-DOS operatingsystems, and anything they did in concert would ipso facto became acompetitive future standard.andM;Adobe's future--and with it the future of Adobe PostScript and Adobefonts--were suddenly in jeopardy.andP;  In an emotional response, John Warnockannounced that Adobe would publish the specifications for its font formatwith all deliberate speed--exactly what the Conference audience had pleadedwith it to do one year before.andM;Actually, Adobe had little to lose at this point.andP;  Several firms had alreadydeciphered the encryption scheme that protected the Adobe trade secret.andP;  RIPSwas openly advertising its ability to run encrypted Type 1 fonts; The Companyshowed software that would take URW outlines and convert them to Type 1format.andP;  The University of California offered to sell anyone the source codefor a complete, working PostScript interpreter--including front encryption,decryption and rasterizing routines--for a flat $10,000.andM;Adobe vociferously defended its claim of being the reigning standard.andP;  Itpointed out that it had working technology, a large library of fonts in thefield, and real momentum behind it.andP;  Apple responded by suggesting that whileAdobe appeared to have made its ATM technology work with the existingMacintosh system software, Adobe would have a difficult time making it workwith the upcoming Macintosh System 7 software (which would include Royalscalable font technology).andP;  It also pointed to pledges of support for Royalfrom a number of key font foundries--including Linotype, which supplied theheart of the Adobe font library.andM;Rally around Adobe.andP;  User response was remarkable.andP;  Many of the people whohad been complaining about Adobe's market position a year ago now rallied toAdobe's defense.andP;  The users clearly wanted to be able to function in aheterogeneous environment.andP;  They wanted to be able to move formatteddocuments from one computer to another, anyplace in the world.andP;  They wantedto be able to send a formatted document to any output device.andP;  Even thoughthey might not like the way Adobe had been doing business, they had reallybought the concept of device independence.andP;  Now, just when they were on theverge of having a single standard, it was being taken away from them and thebearer of that standard, Adobe Systems, was being threatened.andP;  If Microsofthad announced support for Adobe, there would have been dancing in the aisles.andO;Instead, the users felt betrayed.andM;What about IBM?andP;  There was, however, one major player missing.andP;  The Microsoftannouncement put IBM in a very difficult position.andP;  Big Blue already had acommitment to Adobe PostSCript.andP;  But it also had a very important commitmentto Microsoft and to its customers to support a common Microsoft/IBMimplementation of the OS/2 Presentation Manager operating environment.andM;If Microsoft was going to built Royal font technology and Royal fonts intoPresentation Manager, the IBM version of Presentation Manager would not befully compatible with the Microsoft version unless it, too, supported Royalfonts.andP;  Even worse, IBM had also committed that Presentation Manager would bethe common user interface for its SAA (Systems Application Architecture),which spans its entire product line from PC to mainframe computer (with theexception of the Unix workstations).andP;  Whatever IBM did in PresentationManager, it had to support across the entire micro/mini/mainframe productline.andM;IBM announced at the Conference that it would include support for Royal inits version of OS/2 Presentation Manager.andP;  But, much to Microsoft's chagrin,it stopped short of announcing broad support for Royal.andM;Waiting for IBM.andP;  From March '89 until September '89, all eyes has focused onMicrosoft's choice of font technology.andP;  From September '89 until March '90,they focused on IBM.andP;  IBM's position in the industry and the breadth of itsproduct line in computers and printers gave it enormous market clout in itsown right.andP;  Beyond this, other important computer vendors were waiting to seewhat IBM would decide.andP;  If IBM chose Royal, they admitted that they wouldfeel compelled to do the same.andP;  They would not want to be the odd-man-outsupporting a standard different from the one built into 95% of the desktopcomputers plus all larger IBM computer systems and IBM printers.andM;If, however, IBM chose the Adobe technology, it would act as an importantcounterbalance to Microsoft/Apple and increase the chances that other majorcomputer vendors would follow a similar course.andM;The initial bets were that IBM would choose Royal.andP;  Presentation Manager is,after all, central to IBM's whole SAA strategy, and IBM had pledgedsolidarity with Microsoft on Presentation Manager.andP;  In fact, we believe thatIBM came close to endorsing Royal in September.andM;A difficult decision.andP;  The hostile reaction of the attendees at the SeptemberConference alerted IBM to the fact that this was something users care about.andO;The more it delved into the issue, the more IBM realized that the choice offont technology had far-reaching implications.andP;  It needed to have a commonfont technology to insure that customers could even move formatted documentsfrom one IBM computer to another, let alone exchange documents with other,non-IBM systems.andP;  Every significant IBM product division had a stake in thedecision.andP;  It needed to be able to use common fonts on all IBM computers,display them on all IBM graphic screens, and print them on all IBM printers,both PostScript and non-PostScript.andM;The stakes were high and the battle was hard-fought.andP;  We did not know forcertain until right before the Seminars that IBM would, in fact, be able tomake its announcement at the event.andP;  But, with a tremendous last-minute push,after six months of soul searching, internal debate and review, IBM made itscommitment and moved immediately to announce this to the world.andM;IBM picks ATMandM;The opening session of this year's Seminars therefore began with a surpriseappearance by Lee Reswick, the new vice president of system software forIBM's Entry Systems Division.andP;  His message: IBM will use Adobe fonts andAdobe's ATM rasterizing technology across its entire product line--PCs, theAS/400 minicomputer family, the 370-series mainframes and the AIXworkstations (which will use the NextStep user interface and DisplayPostScript to drive the screen).andP;  It will also use Adobe technology in allits printers--including the non-PostScript printers.andP;  IBM's goal is to letusers &quot;print anywhere&quot; using PostScript printers attached to IBM computersand networks.andM;The OS/2 PCs that IBM sells will also support Royal fonts, since Microsoft isbuilding that into the OS/2 operating system.andP;  But wherever it is importantto move documents from PCs to larger computers (which is the case whereverIBM's larger computers are used), it will be necessary to use Adobe fonts.andM;This is not another schism in the PC world, like the split between the EISAand Micro Channel buses, nor a way of keeping clone PCs out of IBM shops.andO;Adobe will itself provide ATM for the Windows and OS/2 environments,presumably in the form of installable modules and probably available throughretail channels just like the Mac product.andM;Customer-driven.andP;  Reswick said that the most important influence in IBM'sdecision was customer feedback.andP;  Starting with the reaction at the ComputerPublishing Conference in September, IBM has heard a strong and consistentmessage from its customers: they want IBM to support Adobe and Adobetechnology.andP;  As a company that now prides itself in being customer-driven,IBM therefore decided to take the course it announced at the Seminars.andM;Adobe resurgentandM;John Warnock made the understatement of the week by saying that Adobe was&quot;extremely thrilled&quot; with IBM's announcement.andP;  Put on the defensive lastfall, Adobe has had to hustle as never before, but it is now the clearfront-runner in the font technology race.andM;Type 1 is public.andP;  True to its word, Adobe delivered the Type 1 fontspecification.andP;  It did this in a very dramatic fashion: it placed 1,000copies of the Adobe Type One Font Format Book on tables for Seminarsattendees.andP;  Within 20 minutes, every one of the books had been snatched up.andO;Considering the technical nature of the book, and the fact that there werejust over 1,250 people in the room at the time, this is pretty amazing.andM;The book is now available directly from Adobe and can ordered by calling(800) 833-6687 (that's 83-FONTS) or (415) 961-4400.andP;  The price in the U.S.andO;is $14.95 plus $5.00 for UPS ground shipping.andM;Adobe said that it had been very careful to make the specification accurate.andO;The material had been &quot;beta tested&quot; by both Altsys and Letraset beforepublication.andP;  Altsys used the information to prepare an updated version ofFontographer that can make Type 1 fonts.andP;  (Last fall, Altsys releasedFontographer 3.0, containing Nimbus Q hint insertion technology.)andP;  Letrasethas updated both LetraStudio (the letterform distortion program) andFontStudio (the font design and creation tool) to handle Type 1 fonts.andM;The release of the Type 1 spec book does not necessarily mean that PostScriptimplementers will have an easier time.andP;  The spec tells what a rasterizerneeds to do, but not how to do it.andP;  Particular implementations may do thisbetter or worse, depending on the skill of the programmers and thethoroughness of their testing and quality-control procedures.andP;  It isimportant to keep in mind that from here on out, a rasterizer will be judgedon its ability to produce type not just at 300 dpi, but also at the lowerresolutions used on computer screens, ink-jet printers, dot-matrix printersand other devices.andM;ATM takes over.andP;  Adobe announced that the rasterizer used in its MacintoshATM product, which is a distinct improvement over its earlier rasterizers,will be used in all future Adobe RIPs.andP;  The ATM rasterizer is alreadyincluded in IBM's OS/2 version 1.2; the first discrete product to use it willbe the HP PostScript upgrade cartridge for the LaserJet IID, IIP and III.andO;Adobe will be licensing ATM technology to other PCL printer makers and toWindows application software developers.andM;Adobe also said that it has licensed ATM to Agfa Compugraphic for use in aforthcoming X11/News driver that will be part of CG's new generation of ASPEcolor publishing systems.andP;  (Details on ASPE follow later in this report.)andO;ASPE runs on Sun workstations, but it uses the ATM font technology instead ofSun's own Folio software.andM;If you count only unit shipments, ATM is the most popular software productAdobe has ever offered.andP;  It claims that it has sold more than 100,000 copiesof ATM for the Macintosh, and that 80% of its ATM customers had not usedoutline fonts previously.andP;  Adobe said that it had an installed base of 23million fonts; if ATM goes over in the PC world the way it has in the Macworld, that may be just the beginning.andM;Font cross-licenses.andP;  Adobe has reached cross-licensing and marketing dealswith Monotype and Agfa Compugraphic.andP;  Both vendors had earlier licensed theAdobe font-making tool set, and both have begun to deliver Type 1 fonts fromtheir own libraries.andP;  The deal means that Adobe will include Monotype and CGfonts in the Adobe Type Library, which heretofore had included only Linotype,Bigelow andamp; Holmes and ITC designs.andM;Royal becomes TrueTypeandM;&quot;Royal&quot; was never more than a code-name used during the development ofApple's font-scaling software.andP;  It has, we were told, now been given anofficial product name: TrueType.andP;  (The old name may be hard to kill, however.andO;In a straw poll taken at the Font Free-for-all session, an overwhelmingmajority of attendees said they preferred Royal.)andP;  The font subsystem's nameis thus closely identified with the Microsoft PostScript interpreter in whichit will run (discussed below), which is named TrueImage.andM;TrueType, said Apple, is on schedule and will be part of System 7, due forrelease sometime this summer.andP;  It has already been extensively tested by themajor font foundries, and pre-release versions will be available to softwaredevelopers this spring, probably in April.andP;  As a result of the early testing,at least one major improvement--dropout control to prevent disjoint lines atsmall sizes--has been added to the rasterizer (see the Seybold Report onDesktop Publishing, Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  7, pp.andP;  3-8).andP;  Apple has obtained trademarklicenses from Linotype and ITC, so it will be able to offer a core set of the35 LaserWriter Plus brand-name faces when System 7 is shipped.andP;  The ITC faceswill be converted into TrueType format for Apple by Bit-stream.andM;Promised compatibility.andP;  But Apple was at pains to emphasize that its currentinstalled base will not be left behind.andP;  First, it is working on a method todownload TrueType fonts into current LaserWriters.andP;  No details were providedon how this is being done, but we can tell you that it appears to work.andO;However, Apple cannot yet offer any promises on whether the technique itdreams up will work in non-Apple PostScript devices such as Linotypeimagesetters, Agfa Matrix slide recorders or other Adobe-licensed laserprinters.andP;  (Our suspicion is that the technique should work in most Motorola68xxx-based Adobe controllers.)andP;  We do not know what the legal ramificationsof this are, or what--if anything--Apple plans to do about future AdobeRISC-based controllers.andM;Second, Apple is providing Adobe with information about System 7, just as itprovides other major independent software vendors with advance information.andO;This information should be sufficient for Adobe to adapt ATM to the newsoftware.andP;  Current users may need to get an upgraded version of ATM, but alltheir fonts should continue to work.andM;Third, the TrueImage PostScript interpreter that Apple is licensing fromMicrosoft will be able to run Adobe Type 1 fonts as well as TrueType fonts.andM;Microsoft fleshed out the picture with further details.andP;  First, TrueType willbe available for Windows this year, but it won't be in OS/2 until version2.0, which still has no public timetable.andP;  Second, TrueImage, a Royal fontpage description language and rasterizer developed by Bauer and licensed toApple, will also be available for Windows.andP;  It will provide on-the-flyrasterizing of outline fonts and yet will take only 50K of RAM.andP;  (The realquestion, of course, is whether users who run DOS networks can afford even50K.)andP;  Third, Microsoft (or HP) will make available a TrueType cartridge forthe HP LaserJet printers--the first announcement of Royal fonts for theLaserJet.andP;  No timetable was announced.andP;  Fourth, Microsoft will support Type 1fonts in OS/2, but it is not committing to support them in Windows.andP;  Instead,Microsoft will rely on Adobe to provide ATM for Windows.andP;  The lastannouncement was that Microsoft will license TrueImage to vendors ofhigh-resolution imagesetters.andP;  Predictably, reaction to this announcement wascool.andP;  Service bureaus may now look forward to buying yet another RIP fortheir imagesetters, if they intend to support Royal users in the future.andM;TrueType speed.andP;  Microsoft and Apple took some pains to demonstrate why theythink the Royal (TrueType) technology is superior to Adobe's technology.andP;  Inthe opening session, Microsoft senior vice president Steve Ballmer ran aside-by-side speed comparison of Royal vs.andP;  ATM.andP;  Running on identicalMacintoshes with everything (including cache memory) tuned to be as equal aspossible, TrueType display was dramatically faster than ATM 1.2 display.andP;  Thesample jobs included both the &quot;waterfall&quot; we reported on in the March issueof our Desktop Publishing report and a PageMaker page.andM;Adobe's response to the demonstration was twofold.andP;  Adobe pointed out thatATM is available now, while TrueType is still months away.andP;  Adobe then saidthat by the time TrueType is available, ATM will have improved its speed andwill be very competitive.andP;  These are valid points, and are commonly raisedwhenever a newcomer shows technology that works better than the currentmarket leader.andP;  (To paraphrase, &quot;You're showing futures, not real product;but our futures are going to be better than your futures.&quot;)andM;Of course, Apple will probably be fine-tuning TrueType's speed at the sametime.andP;  And this leads us to an important point: even if it does nothing else,TrueType will keep pressure on Adobe to improve ATM.andP;  Conversely, Apple willhave to make TrueType very good if it is to overtake ATM in the market.andM;TrueType quality.andP;  In the Font Free-for-All the following evening, MatthewCarter of Bitstream extolled the virtues of the Royal technology.andO;Ultimately, he contends, font foundries will be able to use the TrueTypecommand language to do things that are not now possible, including non-linearscaling of type (adjusting the character shape for best design andreadability at different point sizes).andM;For the moment, however, the challenge remains to get TrueType output onscreen displays and 300-dpi printers up to the quality level of Adobe ATM.andO;Bitstream has developed automatic tools to convert its entire library intoTrueType format, complete with base-level hints.andP;  (The base level providesroughly the same degree of hinting as Adobe puts into its fonts.andP;  Non-linearscaling, context-dependent variants and so on use higher-level hintfunctions.)andP;  Taking advantage of the dropout-control function recently addedto the TrueType repertoire, Bitstream can now generate automatically Royalfonts which, Bitstream says, produce screen display and 300-dpi printeroutput that are approximately as good as those produced using Bitstream's ownSpeedo technology.andM;The problem is that Adobe ATM currently produces output that looksappreciably better.andP;  To get to parity with ATM quality, Bitstream will haveto add instructions to its faces, No one is entirely certain yet how muchwork this will entail.andP;  Bitstream feels that it will not be tootime-consuming.andM;Most of the other major font foundries are still less far along.andO;Compugraphic, Linotype and Monotype reported that they are still findingproduction arduous.andP;  All expect to have a modest number of Royal fonts readyfor the market by the end of the year.andM;The benefits of competitionandM;As the dust settled at the end of the week, the situation appeared asfollows:andM;The leader.andP;  Adobe fonts and Adobe technology are the clear de facto industrystandards.andP;  The Adobe fonts will be supported out-of-the-box by all IBMcomputers and printers (including non-PostScript printers) and by allPostScript printers (including clones) from any source.andP;  They will also besupported (at extra cost) on all Macintoshes and Mac printers (includingQuickDraw devices), PCs running Windows and non-IBM PCs running OS/2.andM;They will not be supported on Hewlett-Packard PCL 5 printers, which use CGIntellifont fonts instead.andM;They will be supported on DEC, Next and IBM workstations.andP;  They are notcurrently supported on Sun Workstations and other workstations that run theSun/ATandamp;T Unix V.4 (which support the Sun/Folio technology, or most X WindowMotif workstations (which currently support only bitmap faces).andM;More than 100,000 Mac users have already purchased ATM.andP;  As ATM becomesavailable for Windows and OS/2 machines and for more Unix workstations, thatnumber will almost certainly rise fairly quickly.andM;Further confirmation of Adobe's position came from an ISO standard meetingheld a few months ago, in which it was agreed that the ISO standard forrepresenting glyphs, or font shapes, would be very close to PostScript.andO;Likewise, the ISO effort to establish a standard page description language(SPDL) is now close to adopting a language that will be a superset ofPostScript but very close to PostScript in many ways.andM;The differences between Adobe and Xerox, the primary PDL vendors with avested stake in this standard, have been resolved in a compromise that, notsurprisingly, favors the overwhelming support for PostScript over Interpress.andO;In both cases, it is clear that Apple's failure to join the standardscommittees has left it without a committed sponsor in the standards arena.andM;Most important of all, there is a huge--and rapidly growing--library ofAdobe-format fonts.andP;  All of those fonts should run on all of the machineslisted above.andM;The challenger.andP;  This means that TrueType will arrive in the market with amuch smaller type library and facing an established standard.andP;  The fact thatthe Royal technology will be built into every Mac with 2 MB or more of memoryand every Windows and OS/2 PC will give it a real boost.andP;  However, in theend, we think TrueType will have to win its position on technical merit.andM;It will have to show real seed or quality advantages.andP;  Font Foundries willalso have to be able to make Royal fonts, with quality at least comparable toAdobe ATM standards, relatively quickly and painlessly.andP;  If not, the libraryof Royal faces will remain comparatively small, or of poor quality, or both.andM;The big winner is the user.andP;  There is no question that the competition hasforced Adobe to run harder.andP;  It is rapidly improving its products.andP;  It isbecoming more competitive in its business practices.andP;  Similarly, Adobe issetting the standards that Royal has to meet or better in order to earn itsplace in the market.andM;From the user's standpoint we now have a de facto standard in the form of theAdobe technology and the Adobe library, with the benefit of an aggressivecompetitor that is pushing Adobe and that could well turn out to offer asuperior product.andM;If Royal catches on, we would expect that everyone (including Adobe) wouldadd support for Royal as well as Adobe-format fonts.andP;  Users should be able tointermix the two kinds of fonts in the same job.andM;Other challengersandM;Thus far, the Royal/Adobe battle seems to be settling down far better thanmost people had expected last September.andP;  There are, however, still a coupleof very important ringers that make things more difficult:andM;Sun's Folio.andP;  Sun Microsystems (which includes its own variant of DisplayPostScript in its News windowing system) initially tried to make a deal withAdobe to license Adobe font technology (and perhaps Adobe Display PostScripttechnology, as well).andP;  When this failed, Sun decided to go out and buy itsown scalable font technology.andP;  It acquired Folio and the Folio fonttechnology in 1988.andM;The converged Sun/ATandamp;T Unix V.4 released this past fall includes the Foliotechnology.andP;  Since we expect Unix V.4 to become the standard kernel for Unixfairly soon (with or without Sun's Open Look user interface), this means thatfor a significant segment of the computing industry--one that is especiallyimportant to publishers--the font wars are not over.andM;We have argued in the past that the Unix world seems to have taken a baddetour by its adoption of X Window.andP;  X is ill-suited to publishingapplications (though it has advantages for some scientific computingpurposes) because it provides a very loose coupling between an applicationand the screen.andM;Our greatest criticism of X has been that it provides only fixed-size bitmapfonts.andP;  However, in System V.4 Sun has provided a workaround.andP;  Theapplication may request any size of font that it likes; the Folio rasterizerprepares a bitmap for that size and hands the bitmap to the X server (underthe table, so to speak) so that the server can always carry out the request.andO;There are a few limitations; for example, there is no good mechanism forresponding to an application that asks for a list of installed font bitmaps.andO;But the X Consortium is working on extensions to the X command set to dealwith these issues.andM;Folio has some clear technical advantages.andP;  The rasterizer is fast.andP;  Thequality of type it generates on the screen and on 300-dpi printers is quiteacceptable.andP;  The automatic hint-generation software works; a respectablelibrary of more than 600 fonts, from Linotype, Monotype, ITC and others, havebeen converted to the F3 format.andP;  If the marked called for it, a lot morecould be produced fairly quickly.andM;Sun is currently selling Sparcstations at a rate of 100,000 per year.andP;  Thisis a tiny number compared to the output of Apple, Compaq, IBM et al., but itis growing rapidly.andP;  And a much larger portion of these machines (and otherUnix workstations) goes to people who will use them to produce documents forpublication.andP;  We think it is too soon to dismiss the impact Sun will have inthe office and publishing markets, and hence the role that Folio may play inthe font market.andM;PCL 5.andP;  The other force in the office market is Hewlett-Packard's LaserJetseries printers (and clones), which outsell PostScript printers by five toone.andP;  Until recently, the publishing community could ignore the LaserJet,since its PCL language was simply too underpowered for graphic arts.andP;  Userswho needed graphics and scalable type had to use PostScript.andP;  With theintroduction of PCL Level 5, that has changed.andM;PCL 5 gives most office users as much graphic flexibility as they are likelyto need: scalable and rotable type, bitmap-and vector graphics.andP;  The thingsthey don't get--halftone screening, arbitrary anamorphic distortion ofobjects, clipping images to a path--are not all that crucial in officedocuments.andP;  These users already like the speed and low cost of PCL printers.andO;With the inclusion of the Resolution Enhancement technology in the LaserJetIII, they are going to think that the quality of results they get out of PCLis better than the output of most 300-dpi PostScript printers, and they aregoing to feel very little incentive to pay extra for PostScript.andP;  Since agreat deal of publishing originates in the office environment (and documentinterchange is much more important there), publishers cannot ignore theimpact of PCL any longer.andM;PCL 5 uses Compugraphic's Intellifont technology for rendering type.andP;  Intransferring PCL documents into a PostScript environment (or into an OS/2 orMac screen environment), it will be necessary to have CG fonts available thatmatch the PCL fonts in widths and glyphs, and to have a mechanism for dealingwith the HPGL/2 plotter commands that make up the PCL graphic functions.andP;  Webelieve that, simply because PCL 5 printers are going to be ubiquitous in theoffice, PCL will be a key fact of life to publishers.andM;In short, even though a major turning point in the font wars has been reached(with an outcome that is a lot less messy than it might have been), a fewissues still must be hammered out.andP;  If all this works as planned, TrueTypeand ATM will compete on a more-or-less level playing field, with neithertechnology locked out of any significant part of the market.andM;It is evident that the Adobe technology has a big head start due to themillions of fonts that are already in use.andP;  On the other hand, once Microsoftand Apple get their next generation of products into the market, the Truetechnologies will have the advantage of being built in, while ATM will be anoptional add-on sale except in IBM brand systems.andM;DEC's network font strategyandM;We think one final piece of the font fracas needs to be included here.andO;Digital Equipment is currently hard at work adding a whole layer of supportsoftware that will provide important services for all DEC-based publishingapplications.andP;  These will include job management and information access toolsas well as unique network-wide font management facilities.andM;It's a safe bet that most people think of fonts and page descriptionlanguages as either absent or present in a particular computer or printer.andO;But DEC is developing a strategy for treating fonts as network-wideresources.andP;  This is an integral part of its vision for electronic documentinterchange across multiple platforms that may have been furnished bydifferent vendors and may not even be running the same operating system.andP;  DECwants its users to be able to ship documents to remote sites, where they maybe displayed or printed on devices that cannot be known in advance.andM;There are some problems to be solved here and some divergent interests to bereconciled.andP;  Users want to have many fonts universally available.andP;  Systemmanagers want to avoid installation hassles and to prevent violation of fontlicense terms while minimizing the overall cost to the organization.andP;  Fontvendors want to get paid for the value they are selling, through securelicensing systems.andM;DEC is therefore working on network conventions for transmitting fontmetrics, for font-naming and font-substitution conventions, and fornetwork-wide site licensing of fonts, which would allow a font to be&quot;paper-clipped&quot; onto the document that uses it.andP;  It is looking intodistributing fonts on CD-ROms, with access to the encrypted contents of thedisk controlled by key codes.andP;  (On the show floor, Agfa Compugraphicdemonstrated just such a system.)andP;  Font services will be an integral part ofthe infrastructure of DEC's network computing vision, as are DECprint and theCompound Document Architecture.andM;Digital has obviously done a lot of thinking about the way electornicdocuments will move within and between networks in the future.andP;  The relevanceto the publishing industry is evident, and we think this will be an importantissue in coming years.andM;Page description languagesandM;The good news in page description languages this year is that the threat ofMicrosoft and Apple each going their own way with their own imaging languagesdid not materialize.andP;  A year ago, it looked as if both would push theirscreen imaging languages (QuickDraw for Apple, GDI for Windows and GPI forOS/2 Presentation Manager) as printer output languages.andP;  This would give themtrue WYSWIYG correspondence between screen display and hard copy output.andP;  Itwould also save Apple some royalties it otherwise would have to pay to Adobefor every Adobe PostScript printer it sells.andP;  (Note, though, that at Apple'ssales volumes these royalties do not represent a substantial portion of thecost of the printer.)andM;Just in time, both companies came to realize that users really expectheterogeneous systems.andP;  They want to be able to share printers between PCsand Macs, and they want to be able to share data files.andP;  In other words,users want a common device-independent output language.andP;  A year later, bothApple and Microsoft are firmly committed to PostScript as a common outputlanguage--only now it will be Microsoft PostScript rather than AdobePostScript.andM;The bad news is that Microsoft intends to address the problem of differencesbetween the screen imaging model and the output imaging language by addingcommands to PostScript that more closely mimic functions performed inMicrosoft screen imaging languages.andM;TrueImage to be shipped in 1990.andP;  At the same time that Apple named its fonttechnology TrueType, Microsoft named its PostScript interpreter TrueImage.andO;Steve Ballmer announced that Microsoft would have an interpreter for the OS/2environment ready to ship by the end of this year.andP;  This initial product willbe entirely compatible with current Adobe PostScript implementations and willrun Type 1 fonts alongside the native TrueType fonts.andP;  TrueImage will also beavailable for licensing to printer and imagesetter vendors.andP;  Unlike Adobe,Microsoft does not develop complete pritner or imagesetter controllers.andP;  Thistask must be performed by the output device vendor or by one of the thirdparty companies which specialize in this sort of thing.andM;Diverging extensions.andP;  But, as mentioned above, Microsoft plans to gofurther.andP;  It promised to develop extensions to its interpreter.andP;  Microsoft'sscreen imaging models, GDI for Windows and GPI for OS/2 Presentation Manager,have a number of functions that are different from the PostScript commands.andO;As a result, current PostScript device drivers must emulate these functionsby a sequence of procedures, and this can be rather inefficient.andP;  (Apple hasthe same problem with its QuickDraw screen imaging model.)andP;  It thereforeplans to add extensions to the page description language that would allowspecific device drivers to optimize the speed of rendering GPI and GDIfunctions.andM;Other extensions would implement various data compression schemes, add adevice-independent color model to the language, and support Kanji, Korean andChinese fonts.andP;  Although Apple has not said anything about its plans, we caneasily imagine more extensions to accommodate its specific requirements.andM;The trouble is, Microsoft is under no obligation to make its extensionscompatible with the extensions that Adobe will doubtless be inventing.andP;  Whilea general desire to make life easier for customers will probably leadMicrosoft and Adobe to discuss matters before they commit to a particulardecision, there are bound to be instances where their interests diverge.andM;We are profoundly troubled by the prospect of two distinct strains of thePostScript language.andP;  True, the differences might be papered over byinstallable device drivers, and perhaps the end users would never perceiveany problem.andP;  But application developers would have to be aware of thedifferences and would have to test their software in more environments,adding to development costs and delaying the introduction of new products.andM;Six platforms.andP;  One of the interesting statements Microsoft made was that ithas ported TrueImage to six chip architectures--Acorn, AMD, Intel, Motorola68K, National Semiconductor and Weitek--and that it intends to keep all sixcurrent as new versions are produced.andP;  The printer controller business isvital to these chip makers, and they work hard to convince printer makers touse their designs.andP;  Microsoft is working hard to make it easy for the printerand controller makers to use TrueImage software.andM;Adobe developers meeting.andP;  For its part, Adobe announced that it will host aPostScript developer's conference in June at which it will lay out its plansand ask for feedback.andP;  We expect that several new standards and extensions toPostScript will be decided at this point.andM;The extensions promised include substantially better support for color andcolor output.andM;Editable PostScript.andP;  At the Computer Publishing Conference in September,there was great interest in the concept of editable PostScript files thatcould be passed from one application program (e.g., PageMaker) to another(e.g., Xpress).andP;  Adobe and several page-makeup program vendors experimentedafter the Conference.andP;  At the March Seminars, they reported to an informal&quot;summit&quot; meeting of vendors and users that the experiment had not beensuccessful.andP;  It took so much data to describe the page that it was deemedimpractical.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
