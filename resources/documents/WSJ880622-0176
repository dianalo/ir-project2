Arianespace, a branch of the agency, announced the program following a successful launching of its Ariane-4 rocket, which first lifted satellites into orbit last Wednesday.    On July 21, an older Ariane-type rocket is to fire a European telecommunications satellite and an Indian satellite into orbit.    An American telecommunications satellite will go up Sept. 8, followed by the Oct. 26 launching of France's first television satellite.    The second launch of the Ariane-4, which is more versatile and can carry heavier loads than its predecessors, is to take place in November.    In December, the final Ariane launch of the year will carry the international communications satellite INTELSAT-5 F-15 into space. </TEXT></DOC>
