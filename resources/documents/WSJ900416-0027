The president has invited 17 nationsto a two-day conference on global warming that begins heretomorrow; the U.S. and Japan are expected during the meetingsto emphasize the potentially staggering costs of reducinggreenhouse gas emissions.   Environmentalists contend that the administration's tacticwill slow any effort to combat global warming. &quot;What they'redoing is backing away from commitments already made,&quot; saidRafe Pomerance, a senior associate at the World ResourcesInstitute, a Washington environmental research organization.&quot;They have absolutely no plans to do anything about globalwarming.&quot;   Bush administration officials deny that. William Reilly,chief of the Environmental Protection Agency, said he expectsthe U.S. to begin preliminary negotiations on a globalwarming compact by the end of the year. He calledcalculations of the economic effect of curbing greenhousegases the &quot;significant missing dimension&quot; in internationaltalks so far on the subject.   Climate scientists say the world may be heating because ofthe rapid increase in the atmosphere of carbon dioxide andother gases produced by human development. These gases trapheat in the atmosphere and block it from escaping into space.During the past century, the earth has warmed about 0.5degree Celsius, according to White House Science AdviserAllan Bromley, but it isn't clear how much of that rise isdue to human activity.   Mr. Boskin, one of the three co-chairmen of theglobal-change conference, played down the significance of thepotential heating. A rise of a few degrees Celsius would besimilar to the change from moving from Boston to Washington,and might even benefit U.S. agriculture, he said.   He also argued that people could use technology to adjustto the warmer weather. &quot;For example, air conditioning hasmade previously less-hospitable climes much more hospitable,&quot;he said.   David Rind, a climate specialist at the NationalAeronautics and Space Administration's Goddard Institute forSpace Studies, said that computer models predict a rise ofbetween about two degrees and six degrees Celsius if theamount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere doubles, asexpected, in the next century. Even a rise of two degreeswould increase droughts in Florida and the southern-mostparts of the U.S., Central America and large parts of Africaand South America. A four-degree rise would be a &quot;disaster,&quot;leading to droughts in most of the U.S., he said.   The earth usually changes temperature exceptionallyslowly. At the peak of the ice age 15,000 years ago, theearth was on average only four degrees Celsius colder than itis today. What makes global warming so menacing, he said, isthat it would vastly accelerate the pace of environmentalchange.   Mr. Boskin said he and his staff hadn't done originalresearch on the costs of greenhouse warming, but had revieweda &quot;substantial number&quot; of U.S. computer models. Cuttingemissions 20% by the year 2005, as has been suggested bycountries in Western Europe, would cost the U.S. &quot;trillionsof dollars -- $100 billion to $200 billion a year would be inthe ballpark,&quot; he estimated.   &quot;It would mean a period of substantially higherunemployment and lower economic growth,&quot; he said, because theU.S. would have to switch to &quot;much more expensive forms ofenergy.&quot;   Even stabilizing carbon dioxide emissions would deal a bigblow to the economy, Mr. Boskin predicted. The last time U.S.emissions of the gas didn't grow was after the Arab oilembargo quadrupled the cost of oil and the economy plummeted.   William Nordhaus, a Yale University economist who servedon the CEA under President Carter, estimated the cost ofstabilizing greenhouse gas emissions overall during the next40 years at about $50 billion a year for the U.S. and $150billion annually for the rest of the world. During the pastyear, Mr. Nordhaus conducted research into the costs oftrying to limit global warming.   Slowing the increase of greenhouse gases so they grow at arate 20% less than predicted would cost little, he said, andmight &quot;actually have benefits&quot; economically.</TEXT></DOC>
