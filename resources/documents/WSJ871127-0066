The strike was the first in a series of rotating walkouts planned by the International Airline Machinists and Aerospace Workers Union, which represents 8,500 Air Canada employees, including baggage handlers and mechanics.    An Air Canada spokesman said that all of its flights to and from Toronto were cancelled yesterday morning. About half of the airline's normal schedule resumed service out of Toronto in the afternoon, when non-union personnel were flown in from Montreal to handle some duties of unionized employees.    About 40% of Air Canada's traffic goes through Toronto.    The spokesman said that if the company is forced by further walkouts to cancel many flights, &quot;we will just shut down the airline.&quot;    As previously reported, the union and the airline reached a tentative agreement in September for a proposed new contract, but it was rejected by the union membership. The issues in dispute include wages and pensions. </TEXT></DOC>
