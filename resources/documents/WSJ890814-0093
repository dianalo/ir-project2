Lloyd Bentsen (D., Texas) will be the finalists in a runoff election early next month to fill the House seat vacated by former Speaker James Wright.    The Republican, pediatric allergist Bob Lanier, finished atop the eight-candidate field in the first round of balloting Saturday with 39% of the vote. Democratic attorney Pete Geren finished second with 32%, with the remaining candidates finishing far behind. A runoff is required because no candidate received more than 50% of the vote.    Although Dr. Lanier, a fixture on Fort Worth television, came in first, Mr. Geren received a formidable boost this weekend when Mr. Wright, who remains enormously popular in his home district, gave him a strong endorsement. The district, drawn to ensure Mr. Wright's repeated reelection, is considered Democratic.    The vacancy was created when Mr. Wright resigned both the speakership and his House seat in the face of charges he violated House ethical rules.    The final round of balloting is something of a surrogate battle between Texas' two senators. Dr. Lanier is the handpicked candidate of GOP Sen. Phil Gramm, while Mr. Geren has the strenuous backing of his former boss, Sen. Bentsen. </TEXT></DOC>
