Carlucci to press the Reagan administration toallow American satellites to be shipped to China and launched intospace aboard its missiles.   Carlucci, who is visiting China for the first time, met for morethan three hours Tuesday with National Defense Minister Qin Jiwei.He also held talks with other officials, including Premier Li Pengand Vice Premier Wu Xueqian.   A Senior Defense Department official, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said Carlucci also discussed U.S. concerns over Chinesearms sales to nations in the Middle East _ a sore point inSino-American relations.   The Reagan Administration is considering whether to grantlicenses to export U.S.-made satellites to China, where they wouldbe launched aboard the so-called Long March boosters.   Two companies have applied for such export licenses _ HughesAircraft Co. and Asiasat, a Hong Kong-based company that purchasedHughes satellites, according to Don O'Neal, director ofcommunications for the Hughes Space and Communications Group, basedin El Secundo, Calif.   ``There are rumors (the launches from China) may be as much as50 percent cheaper'' than the French or American shuttle programs,O'Neal said on Tuesday. He said he could not speculate on the exactcosts of Chinese launches.   The U.S. shuttle program was sidelined by the explosion aboardthe Challenger in Jan. 28, 1986 in which all seven people aboardwere killed.   O'Neal said Hughes is applying for a licence for two oftelecommunications satellites bought by the Australian companyAussat. He said the satellites are owned by Hughes until they arelaunched under a ``delivery in orbit'' contract with the Australiancompany, which has chosen China as the launch site.   Hughes has received no response to its license application,which was made in July, according to O'Neal.   Asiasat owns a Hughes-made Westar 6 satellite that was launchedby the U.S. shuttle in 1984 but failed to reach its proper orbit.It was recovered by the shuttle in 1985, O'Neal said, will berefurbished in the United States. Asiasat must have a U.S. licenseto export it to China so it can be launched again.   The State Department recommended the licenses be approved, butthe Commerce Department and some Republican congressmen sayallowing China to launch U.S. satellites will undercut U.S.companies developing the same service.   On the arms issue, the United States has strongly urged China tocurtail sales of Silkworm anti-ship missiles to Iran and voicedconcern over the recent sale of ballistic missiles to Saudi Arabia.China denied selling arms to Iran.   Deputy Chief of Staff Xu Xin told reporters Tuesday that Chinahas not sold its M-9 medium range missiles to Syria, as reported byforeign news agencies.   On Wednesday, Carlucci is to meet with senior Chinese leaderDeng Xiaoping.</TEXT></DOC>
