LPandamp;L requests authorityto contribute this amount during the term of the MOU in connection withthe phase of the Project.In addition, during the term of the MOU and prior to the expenditure ofall funds committed thereunder by the Parties, the Parties will negotiatethe Project Agreements setting forth, among other things, the organizationalstructure for the Project and the financial and contractual bases uponwhich the Parties may elect to participate in the Project following completionof preliminary activities provided for in the MOU. By participating asa party to the MOU and agreeing to pay its proportionate share of MOU Activitiescosts, PLandamp;L would have the right, subject to any necessary regulatoryapproval, to participate in the next phase of the Project on terms thatwill be negotiated by the Parties and contained in the Project Agreements.The Project Agreement would cover, among other things, the allocation ofresponsibility for expenditures during the remaining term of the ventureperiod, expected to run through November 1992.
