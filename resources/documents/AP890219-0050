(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Law enforcement authorities from around thecountry will meet this week in Quantico to compare notes, hoping tofill in more missing pieces of the puzzle left by serial killer TedBundy before his execution last month.   The FBI will hold the conference at its National Center for theAnalysis of Violent Crime.   ``One of the agents was with Bundy prior to his death and will besharing that information with law enforcement officials,'' FBIspokesman Bill Carter said Friday in a telephone interview from hisWashington, D.C., office. ``We have invited police officers from allover the country.''   An FBI statement said the conference was being coordinated amonginterested law enforcement agencies who had been involved with Bundybefore his execution. Bundy died Jan. 24 in Florida's electric chairfor the 1978 slaying of sixth-grader Kimberly Diane Leach of LakeCity, Fla.   ``The conference had been planned for quite some time to get aresolution on some of the cases that might be out there,'' Cartersaid.   The handsome, articulate Bundy, a one-time law student who becamethe nation's best-known serial killer, for years had cockilymaintained his innocence in the string of killings for which he wasa suspect.   But during his final days, Bundy confessed to the slayings of atleast 23 women in four states and gave information that linked himto other killings. Some investigators have said they believe hisreal total is 100 or more.   In all, Bundy has been suspected at one time or another inkillings in Washington state, Oregon, Idaho, Utah, Colorado,Vermont, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. He was convicted of threekillings in Florida.   Carter said Special Agent William Hagmaier, who is assigned tothe center, was present at Bundy's request at the interviews.Hagmaier had interviewed Bundy several times in the past as part ofthe center's research into serial violence, Carter said.   Salt Lake County Sheriff Pete Hayward said Sunday that twodetectives, Dennis Couch and Jerry Thompson, were leaving forQuantico on Monday and would be there all week.   Couch interviewed Bundy two days before his execution, and atthat time Bundy ``claimed responsibility'' for eight killings inUtah during the mid-1970s when he was a law student at theUniversity of Utah, Hayward said.   ``We linked Bundy to five of them, but there was some commentthat he was responsible for eight, and we're very much concernedwhich ones they are,'' he said.   Hayward said the detectives would ``mainly try to coordinate allof the information developed by other investigators to see ifthere's anything more that we can put into the cases we have openhere.''   Carter said he did not know how many law enforcement officialswould be attending the conference. FBI officials in Quantico did notreturn telephone calls from The Associated Press on Friday.</TEXT></DOC>
