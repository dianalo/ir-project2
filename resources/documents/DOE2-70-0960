The technique provides a homogeneous dose distribution inthe target volume and a considerable dose reduction in the high-riskorgans, i.e., the rectum and the bladder. The optimal dose distributionis achieved by the arc of rotation from 240deg to 300deg. The field sizevaries between 7 and 10 cm. The isocentre is found for each patient individuallyaccording to his anatomical characteristics and the proliferation ofthe tumorous process. Thus, the dose for the dorsal wall of the rectumand the ventral part of the bladder is only 50 to 80% and for the femurneck below 50% of the tumor dose. Using the technique described, irradiationis easy and the accuracy of dose distributions meets the demands of radiotherapy.(L.O.). 3 figs., 5 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
