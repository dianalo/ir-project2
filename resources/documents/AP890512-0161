South African and territorial troops started returning to theirbases Friday, but Pretoria otherwise delayed the U.N. plan forNamibia's independence _ a delay it blames on an April incursion ofseveral hundred South-West Africa People's Organization guerrillasfrom Angola.   Officials said they killed the guerrilla when he resisted arrestat Miershoop, a town well south of the Angolan border. They gave nodetails and did not identify the dead man. According to SouthAfrican figures, the shooting brings the toll to 316 guerrillas and27 security force members killed since April.   For two weeks, the military and counterinsurgency police havebeen following tracks and interrogating villagers in the north toverify whether the guerrillas have left. Several guerrillas havebeen reported killed in the period, and a senior police officer wasrelieved of duty after U.N. police monitors investigated complaints.   ``There have been a very large number of complaints about thesituation in northern Namibia in the last few weeks,'' said U.N.spokesman Cedric Thornberry. He did not elaborate.   Police monitors already are busy investigating complaintsagainst police in the north, he said.   U.N. Special Representative Martti Ahtisaari, in charge ofsupervising the election process, is negotiating with U.N.Secretary-General Javier Perez de Cuellar to increase the monitorsfrom 500 to 1,000, Thornberry said.   Under the U.N. plan, Saturday was the deadline for South Africato scrap all discriminatory laws affecting elections and to reduceits military forces in the territory from 50,000 to 12,000. It alsowas the deadline for Namibian refugees, including disarmed SWAPOfighters, to start returning.   A spokesman for Louis Pienaar, the South African-appointedadministrator-general, said it was pointless to speculate on atimetable until after a meeting Monday to verify whether all SWAPOguerrillas have left Namibia.   Observers from the United States, the Soviet Union and Cuba willattend the meeting of Angolan and South African officials atRuacana, on the border of Angola and South Africa.   The South African Broadcasting Corp. said Friday the meeting``will, in effect, determine whether the independence timetable cango ahead as planned or whether it must be renegotiated.''   Ahtisaari allowed South African soldiers and South-West Africanparamilitary police to leave their bases April 1 to fight theguerrillas. They returned to their bases two weeks ago for a60-hour grace period to allow guerrillas to withdraw. Butterritorial officials say 200-300 SWAPO fighters remain in Namibia.   The soldiers began returning to their bases again Friday, inpreparation for renewed confinement to base from dawn Saturday.   South Africa has agreed to grant independence to Namibia, whichit has controlled for 74 years, in exchange for the withdrawal of50,000 Cuban troops in Angola. SWAPO guerrillas have fought fromAngolan bases in their 23-year war against South African occupation.</TEXT></DOC>
