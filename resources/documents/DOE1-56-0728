New technical possibilities ofprocessing the X-ray image allowing to image the blood flow bed withunprecedented resulting contrast of the respective arterial part. Themethod is used in cardiovascular examinations for preoperative diagnosis,in intervention radiology, for checkups after vascular reconstructionsand for the diagnosis of malformations and tumors. The advantages ofthe method are in that a smaller amount of contrast medium is requiredthan for classical arteriography, a 10 to 20 times lower radiation dose,the examination is cheaper, quicker, may be carried out in outpatientdepartments and the obtained image is immediately available and may futherbe processed. The disadvantage is a poorer imaging of details, a smallerimaged area and the dependence of image quality on the blood circulationvelocity in the patient. (M.D.). 13 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
