But by 1993, the newly enacted deficit-reduction law and animproving economy should begin shrinking the federal shortfall, theCongressional Budget Office said in a report presented to the HouseBudget Committee.   ``The economy appears to be near a turning point - a time whenpredicting its course is particularly difficult,'' said RobertReischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office.   The calculations are the first showing how the five-year, $496billion deficit-cutting law will affect the federal budget over thenext several years. The Bush administration is not expected torelease its own figures until February.   The report, obtained by The Associated Press in advance of thehearing, said that in fiscal 1992, for which the administration isplanning its budget, the shortfall will be at least $337 billion,easily the highest ever. Fiscal 1992 begins next Oct. 1.   But by the following year, the CBO expects the red ink to shrinkto $252 billion and reach $143 billion by 1995, the last year forwhich the study contains projections.   The report cautioned, however, that economic conditions haveworsened since October, when the CBO made its calculations. Oilprices have remained high, the real estate market has been weak andmany banks and corporations have had financial problems, it noted.   ``Unless these factors are offset by other developments, a morepessimistic economic outlook will worsen the budget projections,''the authors wrote.   The budget office said it expects the government to spend $91billion in fiscal 1991 - which runs through next Sept. 30 - bailingout the nation's savings and loan institutions. That figure willpeak at $107 billion in 1992.   But then, as the government begins selling Sandamp;L assets it hastaken over, it will recoup some of its losses, actually earning $44billion in 1994, the report said.   The economy will also take its toll on the budget. As a rule ofthumb, a weak economy means lower federal revenues and higherspending, and thus a bigger budget gap.   Many of the CBO's expectations for economic performance havedeteriorated since it released its last projections last summer.   The budget office now expects the economy to grow at a weak 0.6percent in 1991, down from its 2.5 percent estimate in July. TheBush administration is calling for economic growth at around 0.8percent.   The report also projected that inflation will increase by 5.3percent in 1991, 1.1 percent higher than the CBO called for inJuly. And it forecast unemployment to be 6.4 percent in 1991, upfrom the 5.4 percent projected earlier.   This year's budget gap should be $320 billion, the CBO said. Thedeficit for fiscal 1990 was $220 billion, just below the record$221 billion shortfall in 1986.   But those figures cannot be directly compared with the $320billion projection for next year because they include the huge andgrowing Social Security surplus, expected to reach $66 billion thisyear.   Under new budget rules, that surplus is no longer included infederal deficit calculations. The fiscal 1990 budget gap would havebeen $277 billion had the Social Security surplus not been includedin the deficit figures.   The Gramm-Rudman deficit-reduction law sets new deficit ceilingsfor each of the next few years. If those targets are surpassed,automatic spending cuts can be triggered.   But under the new procedures, the administration adjusts thosetargets to reflect changing economic conditions, so there is littlethreat they will cause the automatic spending slashes to occur.   The CBO's numbers are advisory and are not officially used tomeasure the deficit. That task falls to the White House's Office ofManagement and Budget. Nonetheless, the CBO figures are widelyrespected on Capitol Hill.</TEXT></DOC>
