Sterba </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><G> CNG </G><TEXT>   Ever notice that when Michael Dukakis smiles he looks like a 1949 Buick? Or when George Bush gets whiny he starts sounding like Truman Capote's long lost cousin?    Think ahead, America. These are the guys we are choosing to have to pay attention to all summer and half the fall. And then we face four solid years with either a Democrat described by the Washington Times as &quot;a wooden techno-weenie,&quot; or a Republican who Art Buchwald says looks like every woman's first husband; a Swarthmore man Richard Nixon calls a human word processor, or a Yale man who is the only known survivor of a charisma bypass operation.    It's obvious that the American democratic process -- the finest political machinery, brainpower, computer-generated graphics and pollsters that money can buy -- is letting us down. It has heaved, sputtered and labored mightily, and coughed up milquetoast manikins who already have political comics and cartoonists heading for open windows.    Yes, I know there are other candidates. With the exception of my favorite, Jesse Cantwin, who Mario Cuomo says suffers from the &quot;dumb blond syndrome&quot; (you figure it out), they are a humorless lot. There's none of JFK's quick wit, no self-deprecation. Joke about Jesse and you're in a danger zone. Mario is simply not funny. Prince Albert Goretex? Even his laughter sounds rehearsed. There isn't a belly laugher's agility in the bunch. It's only April, but even the pundits are so bored they're writing about themselves.    Oh, if we could only go back to the future: There was Hartpence, the seven dwarfs, a Snow White in the wings, and a bunch of four-letter Republicans. And we could still laugh. We had a man in the White House who wasn't afraid to use his sense of humor in service to his country. And we appreciated it. When he appointed Ed Meese, the Pillsbury Doughboy of the Reagan administration, as attorney general, we laughed.    Think back to last fall: We had all these bushy-tailed candidates, the none-of-the-above Democrats. It was fun. But they gave up on us too soon.    First there was Hartpence, a divinity school man of at least the religious conviction if not the fervor of a Bakker or Swaggart, who felt so bad about what he had done on the good ship &quot;Monkey Business&quot; that he threw in the towel too soon. Political wisdom at the time was that he should rush out new campaign posters showing FDR, Ike, JFK, LBJ, and himself, with a caption reading, &quot;In the Grand Tradition.&quot; But no, he wimped around and mulled and limped back in too late. You don't see Jimmy Swaggart buckling under to mere guilt. He confessed and got back to business.    Then in the spotlight for awhile we had the seven dwarfs: Babbitt, Simon, Gephart, Gore, Dukakis, Jackson and Biden. At the time, nobody noticed that Mr. Dukakis's shoulders are much too narrow to bear the weight of the world in the Oval Office.    And then -- and oh what a precious moment it was -- we had Patricia Nell Schroeder, whose radiant skin turned out to be so thin that she tearily ruled out running only three days after the Washington Post described her as &quot;a riddle wrapped in a mystery wrapped in polka dots . . .&quot; Think of all the good fun we lost.    Then the four-letter Republicans: Kemp, Dole, Bush, Haig and this guy Pont. And Robertson, a nine-letter word that counts for only 11 points in Scrabble and not much more in politics since he's still in the race and nobody knows it. Anyway, they pranced around with all the excitment of two threesomes at a golf course. But they had promise until Bush whacked Rather, thereby establishing his mettle in future superpower confrontations.    I think back to when Goretex looked like a man who could loosen up, a man who declared that he was country when country wasn't cool. Now in New York, of course, he's kosher, and still as stiff as a bagel. It was Jack Germond and Jules Witcover who divined his &quot;thunderstorm strategy&quot; -- he keeps wandering around waiting for lightning to strike. But Tom Shales of the Washington Post got him right back in December: &quot;Albert Gore still strongly resembles Clark Kent, only he never hops into a phone booth to become something more interesting.&quot;    Bush, meanwhile, seems to have disappeared. There are rumors that he has suspended playing tennis to use the time to stand before a mirror and practice saying, &quot;I am somebody. I AM somebody. I am SOMEbody. I am someBODY.&quot;    On second thought, maybe we need to go a little further back to the future. How about 1960?    ---   Mr. Sterba is a senior writer for the Journal in New York. </TEXT></DOC>
