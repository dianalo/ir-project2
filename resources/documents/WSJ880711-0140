But now the effort is bogged down in American presidential politics.    Negotiators are scheduled to meet today and tomorrow in New York, following recent sessions in London and Cairo, to discuss a U.S. peace plan. It calls for South Africa to grant independence to Namibia, which it occupies in defiance of international law. In exchange, Angola would agree to send home the 40,000-plus Cuban troops that protect its leftist government but whom Pretoria perceives as a threat.    Further negotiating sessions are expected, but both sides may be distracted by the promises emanating from this summer's U.S. political conventions and by Congress's actions in a presidential election year.    Angola hasn't any reason to rush a deal with the Reagan administration. President Reagan strongly supports a rebel group, Unita, that is waging a civil war against Angola's Marxist government. But Michael Dukakis, the likely Democratic presidential candidate, has a different view: he says he would stop aiding Unita, recognize Angola's Marxist government and negotiate with it for removal of the Cubans.    South Africa, on the other hand, appears to have an incentive to reach a settlement before the U.S. elections if it believes Mr. Dukakis may win. The Democratic candidate endorses tougher economic sanctions against Pretoria, saying &quot;we must stop sending mixed signals&quot; to that regime. He also calls for a comprehensive international trade embargo.    Still, even Pretoria is unlikely to agree quickly to the U.S. plan. Sanctions imposed by Congress have contributed to a right-wing backlash in that country. Municipal elections are scheduled for this fall. Confronted with such pressure, Pretoria is unlikely to agree to abandon Namibia.    Concedes a U.S. official, &quot;The idea of compromising and, as a result, bringing to power in Namibia a black {independent} government would be exploited by the right in South Africa.&quot;    To be sure, the possible departure of the Cubans from Angola is an appealing carrot for Pretoria in the U.S. plan. In recent months, Cuban troops, supported by $1 billion annually in Soviet aid, have operated closer than ever to Angola's southern border with Namibia, actually engaging South African troops there in skirmishes. And South African casualties are prompting complaints at home.    But South Africa is loath to ease its grip on Namibia, which it views as a vast desert buffer between it and Angola.    &quot;With so many difficult things to resolve, it would seem miraculous&quot; if the various elements of the plan mesh, said John de St. Jorre, a Ford Foundation consultant who has written about South Africa. Administration officials say the &quot;target&quot; for completing negotiations is the end of September, the 10th anniverary of a United Nations resolution on Namibia.    While South Africa would be required under the U.S. plan to adhere to the U.N. resolution calling for it to give up control of Namibia within one year, Angola agreed at a previous negotiating session only to a four-year phased withdrawal of the Cubans. That lack of symmetry could make the issue difficult to resolve, though one U.S. official says the Angolan offer was just &quot;an opening position.&quot;    The Reagan administration's support for Unita is another stumbling block. President Reagan has embraced Unita's leader, Jonas Savimbi, as the embodiment of the Reagan Doctrine, which supports &quot;freedom fighters&quot; in wars of liberation against Marxist regimes. &quot;We aren't trading our relationship with Unita,&quot; the senior administration official says. &quot;It isn't a bargaining chip.&quot;    Angolans say any internal reconciliation plan would have to exclude Mr. Savimbi, but the White House's lavish support for the rebel leader, who visited here last month, makes it impossible for the U.S. to dump him. The administration says Unita and its war against Angola's government is an internal matter that isn't part of the international negotiations.    Meanwhile, with its time in office running out, the administration is trying to convince both sides that it's in their interest to make a deal quickly.    &quot;We're a familiar cast of characters. Who knows what will be on the table in the next administration? Who knows if they'll have anything at all?&quot; asks the senior administration official. &quot;Time isn't running out against us, time is running out against the parties,&quot; he concludes. </TEXT></DOC>
