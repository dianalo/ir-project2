Micro processorbased control and health monitoring systems built into the shearer, havemade automatic horizon control of ranging drum shearers a reality, resultingin increased productivity and efficiency. Automatic fault diagnosis onboard the machine has led to reduced down time, and remote monitoring,either at the surface or off the coalface, is fulfilling important control,maintenance and management functions. The transmission of digital informationis also resulting in the transfer of information from the shearer andother face activities to give automatic roof support control. The paperalso looks into the future and speculates on how electrical and electronictechnology can possibly further improve activities at the coalface. 7figs.</TEXT></DOC>
