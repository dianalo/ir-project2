I married into a family ofUkrainians who braved the Gulag; they came here to the U.S.,where they have become the heart and soul of what is goodabout traditional America.   Now they see their decades of support for Republican Partypolicies rewarded by the insensitivity of Messrs. Bush andBaker, neither of whom seemingly could tell Kiev from achicken or find Odessa outside of Texas. More than 70 yearsof Moscow's brainwashing of Americans about the Third Romeand the New Jerusalem have paid off: The Flower of Yale hasbought it all.</LP><TEXT>   Michael W. Cunningham   Darien, Conn.   ---   Mr. Brooks's article was absolutely terrific. I, too, findit baffling why the administration is so anti-Ukrainian whena democratic Ukraine would be such a stabilizing factor inEastern Europe.   Unlike Mikhail Gorbachev and the old Soviet center,Ukraine does not want billions of dollars in American aid,but technical assistance and help in setting up a trulydemocratic and pluralistic society. George Bush's reluctanceto help the Ukrainians in this endeavor makes one wonder whatkind of American our president really is. Why was he sowilling to spend billions of dollars and American blood todefend a Middle Eastern feudal sheikdom, but is unwilling togive mere recognition and technical aid to a nation that hassuffered so much at the hands of Soviet Russian dominationand wants to emulate not Russia but America?   The only thing I didn't like about the article was theinclusion of Ivan Drach's statement about Ukrainian poetTaras Shevchenko: &quot;Taras Shevchenko is our Jesus Christ.&quot; TheUkrainian people are a very Christian people; yes, Mr.Shevchenko has a special place in the hearts of Ukrainians,and he can be compared with Shakespeare -- but certainly notto Jesus Christ.
