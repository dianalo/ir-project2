Goodyear could not estimate the cost of the plant, plans forwhich were announced Friday, said company spokesman Hank Ruppel.   Goodyear now ships U.S.-made tires to auto producers in Japanand Korea. But Ruppel said the new foreign plant would not affectU.S. production because the Asian market was expanding.   Goodyear, the world's largest tire manufacturer, has 88 plantsin 27 nations, including seven in the Pacific Rim. Goodyear's saleslast year were $9.9 billion.   The planned Korean plant, which should be completed in Spring1991, will produce more than 3 million steel-belted radial tiresannually.   ``We need this factory to supply the expanding exportrequirement of Goodyear's current business in Asian markets otherthan South Korea,'' said Philip Spanninger, Goodyear director oftechnology and venture management. ``Our sales to the Japanese autoindustry are growing rapidly.''   The company will export 75 percent of the tires made at theSouth Korean plant to Asian countries, primarily Japan, and 25percent would be for exported Korean-built cars.   Ruppel said talks with South Korean officials began about threeyears ago and the company applied last fall for permission to buildthe plant.   He said the Korean plant would be smaller than any of thecompany's U.S. facilities and its technology would be on par withthat of some U.S. plants.</TEXT></DOC>
