The Commerce Department announced the one-year agreement Friday,days before a June 29 deadline.   Rep. Jolene Unsoeld, D-Wash., called the pact disappointing. Sen.Frank Murkowski, R-Alaska, said he had ``serious doubts'' about theagreement.   ``It certainly isn't the agreement we were looking for,'' saidUnsoeld, a member of the House Marine and Fisheries Committee. ``Ithink our fishermen had hoped for a lot more.''   ``Piracy of our fish will continue,'' said Rep. John Miller,R-Wash., also a member of the fisheries panel, pointing to``evidence of past behavior.''   The Japanese use the nets for squid. Drift nets are small-meshnets that can stretch more than 30 miles long, hanging in the waterand snaring virtually any mammal, bird or fish that comes incontact. Officials said that on any given day, the nets can covermore than 30,000 miles of ocean.   The Commerce Department has said the nets poses a threat to themarine environment and the West Coast U.S. fishing industry.   The one-year agreement, confirmed in an exchange of lettersbetween Commerce and State Department negotiators and the JapanFishing Agency, calls for some monitoring of the Japanese fishingfleet in the North Pacific.   But Japan is not required to make any commitment about revisingor curtailing its use of drift nets.   ``This agreement achieves a real commitment, rather than a vaguepromise, that major advances in Japanese fleet monitoring andenforcement will take place on a multi-year basis,'' CommerceSecretary Robert Mosbacher said in a statement.   ``If this progress is reflected in results, we will have achievedan important balance between our fishing trading relationship andour environmental responsibilities.''   Greenpeace spokesman Alan Reichman said from Seattle that theenvironmental group was concerned that ``this deal simply isn'tgoing to go far enough in setting the level of observerparticipation and other measures that would set a foundation for aban in the future.''   Brian Gorman, spokesman for the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration, said Japan, as recently as last month, was unwillingto accept any proposal. He said the settlement was hastened by thethreat of trade sanctions against Japan, along with South Korea andTaiwan, on fishery products imported into the United States.   The Drift net Act of 1987 gave the commerce secretary until June29 to reach an agreement.   Under the agreement, up to four research fishing vessels will beallowed to accompany Japanese fishing fleets, which consist of about460 vessels.   The research vessels _ three from Japan and one from Canada _will be equipped with transmitters so data can be collected todetermine ``who catches what and where,'' Gorman said.   Japanese and American observers also will be placed on Japanesevessels so the location of the vessels can be determined.</TEXT></DOC>
