THE AVERAGE American household spent $24,414 in 1987. Just how was the money divvied up?    The largest share -- $7,569 -- went toward housing and related expenses, from taxes to furnishings, the Bureau of Labor Statistics says. The second-largest category was transportation, with families spending an average of $4,600 on cars and other vehicles, insurance, repairs and public transport.    Food took $3,664, with $2,099 spent on chowing down at home.    Among the smaller categories: An average of $2,175 went toward personal insurance, pensions and Social Security. Clothing and related services, such as dry cleaning, used up $1,446. Another $1,193 was dished out on entertainment, slightly outstripping the $1,135 spent on health care.    Households with incomes of $50,000 or more spent an average of $51,433 in 1987. Those with incomes below $10,000 spent an average of $10,930, factoring in government assistance.    Low-income households spent 36% of their money on housing, compared with 29% for affluent households. Affluent households spent a disproportionate share on personal insurance and pensions: 13.5% compared with 2.5% for poor households.    ---@ The Household Budget @ Percent of expenditures by category, 1987 @ Housing 31.0% @ Other 20.3 @ Transportation 16.9 @ Food 15.0 @ Insurance/pensions 8.9 @ Apparel 5.9 @ Source: Census Bureau, Consumer Expenditure Survey, 1987    What Kind of Wife Earns    More Than Her Hubby?    THERE ARE 29 million dual-earner couples in the U.S., and among them 18% have wives who earn more than their husbands.    The profile of those wives is different from other working women. For one, they are more likely to work full time, year-round. Some 78% of higher-earning wives work regular, full weeks through the year, while just 46% of the wives who earn less than their husbands work those hours.    Women who earn more than their husbands aren't necessarily in higher-paying jobs than their spouses, but many work more hours. Only 56% of husbands who earn less than their wives work full-time and year-round, compared with 87% of husbands who earn more than their wives.    Higher-earning wives are more likely to have some college education than lower-earning wives. Forty-eight percent of higher-earning wives have one or more years of college education, compared with 43% of wives who earn less than their husbands.    Wives who earn more than their mates are slightly older than those who earn less; 32% of the group are 45 or older, while just 28% of lower-earning wives are 45 or older. Knowing that, it's not surprising that the higher earners are less likely to have young children at home; just 48% have children under age 18, compared with 59% of wives who earn less than their husbands.    Hispanic Households    Grow Less Traditional    HISPANICS TEND to be family oriented, but they are seeing a decline in traditional, married-couple families along with the general population, the Census Bureau says.    In 1988, 81% of Hispanic households were families (consisting of two or more related people), down from 84% in 1980. Just 71% of non-Hispanic households were families in 1988, down from 75%.    The share of Hispanic households headed by married couples in 1988 was the same as for non-Hispanics, at 56%. But the share of female-headed families was higher, at 19% compared with 11% for non-Hispanic households. Single men rarely head families in either group: Just 6% for Hispanics and 3% for non-Hispanics.    The share of families headed by one adult has risen for both groups, but especially for Hispanics. Some 24% of Hispanic families are headed by a single person, up from 20% in 1980. In non-Hispanic families, 14% are headed by one adult, up from 13%.    Some 20% of Hispanic households and 29% of non-Hispanic households aren't families, meaning they consist of people living alone or with nonrelatives. In 1980, just 17% of Hispanic households and 26% of non-Hispanic households weren't families.    Odds and Ends    IT COST EMPLOYERS in the U.S. an average of $36,891 to relocate a homeowning employee in 1988, compared with just $9,924 to relocate a renter, according to a survey by Runzheimer International, a management consulting firm. Most employers pick up some expenses incurred during house-hunting trips. . . . Some 83% of children now aged 12 will be the victims of violent crime at some point in their lives, the Bureau of Justice Statistics calculates. But James Lynch, professor of justice, law and society at American University, says the figure is too high. He faults the statistic for spreading the incidence of crime over the entire population, not accounting for the fact that some people will be victims more than once, while others are at low risk of ever being victims. </TEXT></DOC>
