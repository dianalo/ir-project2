The military attack on student pro-democracy protesters and theirsupporters this month has been followed by more than 1,200 arrestsand an intense media campaign condemning any suggestion that thepower of the ruling Communist Party be limited.   Political purges are expected, starting with party GeneralSecretary Zhao Ziyang, who reportedly has been stripped of his power.   So far, the cultural and economic aspects of Western culture haveescaped attack.   The crackdown seems likely to increase the great divide betweenthe economic sphere, where selected Western methods are studied andadopted, and the political sphere, where Western philosophy is taboo.   Industrialist Lee Iacocca's autobiography is acceptable, forexample, but not the Declaration of Independence.   For a government based on Marx's tenet that economics determineseverything else about a society, it is an interesting andtension-ridden division.   This division is at the heart of conflict between senior leaderDeng Xiaoping on the one hand, and dissident Fang Lizhi and thestudent protesters on the other.   For more than a decade, Deng has sought to shake up an economydevastated by collectivization, political battles and an economicplanning system that discouraged initiative and bailed out failingfactories. In economics, Deng said, pragmatism is best: ``Black cat,white cat, it doesn't matter as long as it catches mice.''   But Deng always stressed the complete authority of the CommunistParty. Two previous efforts to achieve a democratic breakthroughthrough public outcry _ the 1978-79 Democracy Wall movement and1986-87 nationwide student marches _ were put down with arrests andpurges.   Fang, who has taken refuge with his wife in the U.S. Embassy inBeijing, won a wide following among fellow intellectuals for arguingthat economic and political reforms cannot be divorced.   Although there is no evidence Fang encouraged the studentprotesters in their spring campaign, as the government charged, theyechoed his position. Many economic problems, they said, such asinflation and shortages, were linked to official corruption and acontrolled press that dared not expose it.   Many students praised the example of the Soviet Union, wherePresident Mikhail S. Gorbachev has allowed a relative ferment ofpolitical debate.   If the students had been willing to make their suggestions togovernment-sponsored youth groups and student unions, there mighthave been no great stir.   But they rejected the official bodies as not representing themand demanded a direct say. Their stance implicitly challenged theability of the party to represent them as well. This, it appears,was going too far.   Many intellectuals had hoped China's economic reforms would carryover to the political system, regardless of Deng's intentions. Inthe six months before the protests began, some thought this washappening.   Small groups of intellectuals held ``salons'' to read poetry anddiscuss democracy. National television broadcast a lengthy seriesthat criticized China's traditional culture as backward, andalthough Vice President Wang Zhen denounced it, the authors were notpunished. Greater daring was allowed in art and film.   These developments may have angered aging leaders, including Deng.   One Western diplomat said the start of the student protests inmid-April may have been seized on by the conservatives as anopportunity to embarrass relative liberals such as Zhao.   The movement for greater political reform flagged several timesover its seven-week span, but the government passed repeated chancesto end it peacefully.   Instead, according to this theory, it waited until sympatheticteachers, researchers, government workers and even soldiers wereinfected with the students' enthusiasm and joined in marches,revealing their true thinking. Then it condemned the protests ascounterrevolutionary and ordered the army to put them down.   If this theory holds, purges of intellectuals and governmentworkers can be expected to be fairly extensive. On the other hand,the leadership has a stake in restoring normal production as soon aspossible, and heavy purges would make this difficult.   Regardless of how many people are purged, Chinese interviewedsince the crackdown predicted more protests for democracy within afew years.   One explained: Deng believes he can open a window to the outsideand put up a screen to keep out the flies. But even the air fromoutside is infected with democracy.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   Kathy Wilhelm has been reporting for TheAssociated Press out of Beijing since 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
