His colleagues, Montenegro noted, charged the equivalent of $25to $40 an hour three months ago. Now, they're lucky to get $5.   ``Everyone is pauperized,'' he said.   Said Flavio Chiari, a 21-year-old employee at a foreign exchangehouse: ``A year ago, you could invite a bunch of friends over for acookout. No problem. Now, to do that everyone has to bringsomething.''   That's because food prices have risen so rapidly. A kilogram(2.2 pounds) of beefsteak cost 500 australes (76 cents) at thebeginning of July and rose to 1,000 australes ($1.53) by the end ofthe month.   In the same period, a quart of milk doubled to 120 australes (18cents) and a loaf of bread increased by 100 percent to 280australes (43 cents).   The price increases come in sudden jumps. The cheapest pack ofcigarettes doubled in one day to 420 australes (64 cents).   And increases have been coming that way for months. A movieticket that cost 25 australes in February now costs 700. A pair ofleather mocassins that cost 770 australes in February now cost19,000.   Hardship and gloom obscure the fact that Argentina as recentlyas the 1920s had a per capita income on a par with Switzerland's.Buenos Aires put in a subway system, just after New York City did.   Argentina still is potentially rich. The flat, fertile pampascontinue to produce huge surpluses of grain and beef. Argentina isnearly self-sufficient in oil and has vast natural gas reserves.Fisheries in the South Atlantic are virtually untapped.   Argentina's climate is temperate and most of its citizens sharea common European ancestry, the same language, race and RomanCatholic religion.   Zuleta, the analyst who also is a pollster, sees Argentina'sproblem as political, not economic, however. Schisms _ oftenviolent, sometimes bloody _ between and within labor unions,businesses, political parties and the armed forces, which haveoverthrown six governments since 1930, are the real problem, hemaintains.   ``The political failure is the key to understandingeverything,'' he said. ``It's not just a rich country that is badlyadministered. It's badly administered because of politicalideology.''   The ideology may be shifting. The crisis has underminedcherished beliefs that the state should provide services, educationand jobs.   ``All of us together will cure Argentina or Argentina willdie,'' Menem said in his inaugural address. ``This is the cruelchoice.''   In his first two weeks, Menem forged alliances with rivalpolitical parties, reached out to business and farm groups whosemembers probably did not vote for him and took steps to resolve amilitary impasse that sparked three barracks revolts againstAlfonsin.   On the theme of the state-directed economy that is a legacy ofhis party's founder, Juan Peron, president in 1946-55 and 1973-74,Menem says, ``We want a state that allows the nation to live, thatis its servant and not its jailer.''   So far, Menem's solution is much like Alfonsin's: raise utilityrates but also salaries, reduce government expenditures andincrease tax revenues.   The new elements are Menem's plan to sell state companies whoseoperating losses contribute to the fiscal deficit and thesuspension or elimination of subsidies to private businesses thatcost the government billions of dollars a year.   Legislation has been introduced in Congress to do both. Quickapproval is likely, though the first privatizations may not be seenfor a year or more.   Jose Luis Manzano, president of the Peronist bloc in the lowerhouse of Congress, said Menem is racing against the clock.Argentines who can barely pay heating, electricity and telephonebills won't wait long for things to get better.   How long?   ``Three months,'' Manzano replied.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 6</NOTE></DOC>
