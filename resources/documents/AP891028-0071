Suzuki, prime minister for the Liberal Democratic Party between1980 and 1982, said he would retire from politics when his termexpires next summer, said Kazuhiko Hiraga, a spokesman for Suzuki'selection committee in Morioka, in northern Japan.   Suzuki, 78, will make an official announcement at a newsconference after the election committee's regular meeting Sunday,Hiraga told The Associated Press.   ``To us, (Mr. Suzuki's) decision came out of the blue,'' Hiragasaid.   Earlier this year, Kakuei Tanaka, 71, and Takeo Fukuda, 84, saidthey also will not run again and will leave their seats in thepowerful lower house of Parliament next summer.   Suzuki told the NHK broadcasting network he believes the two``decided to resign as a younger generation of politicians hasbecome active and it's time for senior people to retire.   ``I strongly feel a big wave of change coming with the newgeneration,'' said Suzuki, whose party has been dogged by a seriesof sex and influence-peddling scandals for more than a year.   Fukuda told Kyodo News Service he was surprised by Suzuki'sdecision and said he hoped Suzuki would remain active in politicseven though he would not be in office.   Hiraga said reactions from Suzuki's local election committeewere varied. ``Some say it's disappointing to see Mr. Suzuki leave,while others say it's about time.''   The Cabinet of Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, Japan's thirdpremier this year, was only a few months ago considered atransitional government to smooth over the rocky political fortunesof the Liberal Democrats.   Recent opinion polls show Kaifu, who at 58 is considerably moreyouthful than most party leaders, gaining in popularity amongvoters, partially due to his planned revisions of an unpopular 3percent sales tax.   Suzuki became prime minister in July 1980, after the suddendeath of Prime Minister Masayohi Ohira. He resigned in November1982 after a series of unpopular political moves, including adecision to freeze a pay raise for the country's 500,000 publicservants.   Fukuda left office in 1978 and Tanaka in 1974. Tanaka's exit wasprompted, though not forced, by a Lockheed payoff scandal, whileFukuda was suffering a drop in popularity due to economic recession.</TEXT></DOC>
