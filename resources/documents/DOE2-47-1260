<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-47-1260 </DOCNO><TEXT>In the assessment and control of air pollution, there is a critical needfor reliable and consistent data on the quantity and characteristicsof emissions from the numerous sources that contribute to the problem.The large number of individual sources and the diversity of source typesmakes conducting field measurements of emissions impractical on a source-by-sourcebasis. The only feasible method of determining pollutant emissions fora given community or base is to make general emission estimates typicalof each of the source types. Compilation of these emission estimatesor airborne pollutant discharges including oxides of nitrogen (NO(x)),oxides of sulfur (SO(x)), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), andparticulates (PA) over a period of time, usually one year, is referredto as an Emissions Inventory. A useful tool for estimating general emissionsfor an emissions inventory is the emission factor. This is an estimateof the rate at which a pollutant is released to the atmosphere as a resultof some activity (such as combustion or industrial production) dividedby the level of that activity. The use of emission factors for manualcalculation of emissions as well as data-collection procedures necessaryfor completion of the emissions inventory are provided within. This reportprovides guidelines for bioenvironmental engineers and technicians onhow to perform Air Emission Inventories (AEIs). This report providesexample calculations, blank data sheets, emission factors, and an examplecompleted AEI.</TEXT></DOC>
