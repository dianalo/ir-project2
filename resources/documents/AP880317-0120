SCHAFER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   President Reagan has not discussed pardoninghis former aides indicted in the Iran-Contra affair, his spokesmansaid today.   ``There's been no discussion of pardons,'' White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater said. ``We don't discuss pardons. Period.''   Fitzwater was asked about such an action in light of Wednesday'sindictments of Reagan's former national security adviser JohnPoindexter Lt. Col. Oliver North, and two arms dealers on chargesin the diversion of Iranian arms sales profits to the NicaraguanContra rebels.   The president has never criticized his aides for lying toCongress, shredding documents or participating in a cover-up. Andwhile he has steadfastly refused to discuss the possibility ofpardons, he has been equally careful not to rule them out.   But several presidential and Constitutional scholars said thatif he decides to pardon any of the Iran-Contra defendants, Reaganprobably will wait until after the November election to prevent theissue from hurting Republican candidates.   Reagan is well aware of the example of his Republicanpredecessor, Gerald Ford, whose Watergate pardon of Richard Nixonon Sept. 8, 1974, sent Ford's popularity ratings tumbling andhelped put a Democrat into the White House in the next election.   In the case at hand, Reagan has made it clear _ particularly inhis description of North as an ``American hero'' _ that he isgiving the former national security council aide the benefit of thedoubt.   After Congress completed its Iran-Contra investigation, Reaganwent on national television to say he thought North and Poindexter``believed they were doing what I would've wanted done.''   And when he was questioned at one point about the law barringdirect or indirect military aid to the Contras, Reagan responded:``I don't think that the law was broken.''   If Reagan chooses to grant pardons to anyone connected with theaffair, he would not even have to list a specific crime that isbeing pardoned.   Such sweeping power amounts to a legal grant of absolution,enshrined in the Constitution. The Founding Fathers borrowed theconcept from English common law.   The Constitution allows a president virtually unlimitedauthority to pardon involving ``offenses against the United tates,except in cases of impeachment.''   ``He's really very free,'' said C. Thomas Dienes, a professor ofconstitutional law at George Washington University.   A president is able to grant a pardon involving a federal crimesolely on his own initiative _ he need not consult anyone nor evenwait for an indictment or conviction before taking action, Dienessaid.   Dienes said the principal cost of a Reagan pardon ``would bepolitical.'' He said the president would have to make a case forthe pardon by arguing that he believed his subordinates had actedin the cause of the national security, or that he wanted to sparethe country a national trauma.   ``I'm sure he'd catch a lot of political flak, and he wants togo down as a popular president _ but since North was perceived bysome as a popular hero, I'm not certain there'd be such negativereaction,'' Dienes said.   During his nearly eight years in office, Reagan has granted 333pardons out of 1,894 requests, according to the Justice Departmentoffice in charge of handling them. But none of the cases has hadanywhere near the high profile of the Iran-Contra indictments.   Although Reagan is barred from running again, his decision couldaffect Vice President George Bush's chances and those of other GOPcandidates, according to Stephen Hess, a senior fellow andspecialist in presidential affairs at the Brookings Institution inWashington.   Hess predicts that if Reagan decides to pardon any Iran-Contrafigures, he will wait until after the November elections.   ``Since Ford's action cost him the election, I doubt we'll seeReagan move before November,'' Hess said.   Reagan would not leave such a decision to a Democrat, nor wouldhe burden Bush with it if he were elected, Hess reasoned.   ``I would be stunned if there isn't a pardon between electionday and January 1989,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
