About 1,000 delegates were to decide the party's official standin a Nov. 26 national referendum on dismantling the army. Theproposal for unlateral disarmament is given no chance at the polls,but the Socialists' position on it could have an impact on thecountry's 30-year-old coalition government.   The proposal has drawn fierce reactions from the Socialists'three center-right partners in a governing alliance often cited asa prime factor in Switzerland's political stability.   A leader of the conservative Swiss People's Party, ChristophBlocher, has said an anti-army decision by the Socialist Partycongress should spell the end of the government coalition.   Switzerland's army has not fought a foreign war for fivecenturies but Western military experts have rated it as one of theworld's best-trained and most highly motivated forces.   The Socialists' right wing and trade union leaders were seekinga resolution to keep the army. The left wing was inclined towarddismantling the army.   Party President Helmut Hubacher predicted that the meeting,which was to open in Bern today, would decide not to issue arecommendation. That, too, would provoke criticism from thecenter-right.   The anti-army proposal was authored by socialists and religiouspacifists. They collected 113,000 signatures backing a proposedamendment to the federal constitution saying ``Switzerland has noarmy'' and deleting all references to defense needs. Under thesystem of direct democracy in this nation of 4.2 million voters,the signatures were enough to force a nationwide vote.   Even supporters admit the proposal has no chance of winning andwas mainly meant as a pro-disarmament demonstration. But it hasposed a predicament for the Socialists, Switzerland'ssecond-largest political party, ever since being officiallysubmitted three years ago.   In its platform, the party endorses Switzerland's armedneutrality but it has a record of being critical about the defensebudget and procurement plans.   Hubacher, 63, a former infantry private, urged unsuccessfully aclear position against the proposal, which he called ``a rottenegg.''   ``It is an illusion to think we should set an example anddisarm,'' he said in an interview. ``It is not we who are a threatto the world but the big powers.''   The two Socialist members of the seven-member federal executive,Foreign Minister Rene Felber and Finance Minister Otto Stich, alsohave spoken against the proposal. Senior party members warned thatsupporting the proposal would boost conservative groups that splitfrom the main party in recent years.   But warnings have not stemmed a surprisingly strong pacifistgroundswell in the party, particularly among the young and in urbanregions.   At the special congress, the party's future defense concept isthe only point on the agenda.   Recent public opinion polls suggest that about one of fourvoters might sympathize with the ``zero option.'' Women appear tooppose disbanding the army more than men, though feminist groupsfavor the proposal.   Polls are not always reliable in multilingual, multiculturalSwitzerland. But even the conservative Neue Zuercher Zeitungnewspaper in a recent editorial conceded a ``declining trend'' inpopular support of the army.   Protests have been growing against low-flying combat planes,projects to expand army exercise grounds, and noise from mandatoryregular target practice by militia members at the country's 2,500shooting ranges.   But most Swiss remain opposed to a farewell to arms in thecountry where the military has a long tradition.   ``I understand every voting citizen who may be tempted to usethis occasion for venting personal anger at the army or the DefenseDepartment,'' Defense Minister Kaspar Villiger was quoted astelling the independent Basler Zeitung newspaper.   ``But this time, we are closely watched from abroad. Andtherefore it is particularly important to make plain as firmly aspossible that we remain committed to armed neutrality and to thedefense of our country.''</TEXT></DOC>
