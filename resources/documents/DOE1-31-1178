In these complex situations, the use of vision systems showsa great potential of application. In fact, in the robotic field, real-timevision systems are used for detection of objects, for determination oftheir geometric features, for measurement of position and distance, fortracking of moving objects, for guidance and finally for visual feedback.Is it possible to apply the algorithms developed in robotic applicationsto the automation of mining operations? What are their specific constraintsin the mining environment? What actually is the real potential of visionsystems in remote control? Based on some examples of applications takenfrom the robotic field and using images taken in an underground mine,some conclusions are derived regarding the potential applications ofvision systems to mining operations.</TEXT></DOC>
