(excerpt from book dealing with court battle betweenBill Millard and John Martin)(part 2)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Littman, Jonathan.andM;</AUTHOR><DESCRIPT/><TEXT>LAST MONTH, in an exclusive excerpt from Jonathan Littman's new, expandededition of Once Upon a Time in ComputerLand, we looked back at the headyearly days of the personal computer industry and Bill Millard's Cinderellatrip to the top.andP;  It might as well have been a dream.andP;  The autocratic,est-loving &quot;Instant Billionaire,&quot; cofounder of the giant chain of computerstores, rode the crest of his fortune, then suddenly foundered in the wake ofa stunning court challenge, and was tossed from power by his own franchisees.andM;But the stakes of the game changed when Millard charged government officialswith bribery in the tiny, tax-haven Pacific island on which he lives inself-imposed exile.andM;In the following pages, Littman brings the amazing tale to its improbableconclusion.andP;  In our April issue, we ended Part 1 in the California AppellateCourt.andP;  As Part 2 begins, we visit a courtroom in Hawaii, where Millardnemesis and ComputerLand cofounder john Martin faces a child-custody battleand talks of &quot;evil spirits.&quot; IT WAS A typical November day in Maui: thebright blue sky was softened by an occasional, buoyant cloud.andP;  Inside thecourtroom, John Martin, his hair long and disheveled, sat at the small tablebefore the judge.andP;  Some had seen him carry a canvas duffel bag into thecourt.andM;The judge called Sister Mary Moran to the stand.andP;  Her voice wavered and shetrembled.andP;  Her only adornment was her Order of the Daughters of Mary andjoseph pin and the gold cross that hung from her neck.andM;A friend of Susan Musumeci, Martin's ex-wife, Sister Mary had lived with theMartin family in their California Bay Area home while studying at nearbyBerkeley.andP;  She explained that she was working on a degree with a specialty inthe diagnosis and treatment of drug abuse.andM;Martin had threatened the nun, as he had his wife, other family friends, andneighbors.andP;  Police reports were on file in two states, and one was headed&quot;Terroristic Threatening.&quot; Martin told one man he threatened to kill, &quot;I amnot the type of person you want for an enemy.&quot;andM;None of this stopped Sister Mary.andP;  Her testimony was clear and resolute.andP;  &quot;Isaw him [Martin] under the influence of drugs,&quot; she testified.andP;  &quot;I've seenthe drugs in the bathroom and in the bedroom.&quot;andM;But one last witness remained in the most important trial of John Martin'slife-Martin himself.andM;Martin had attended more trials than many trial lawyers, had plotted with thebest, and had been sued for more millions than most major corporations inAmerica.andP;  His attorney questioned him, but the lawyer was just forappearances.andM;Martin needed no one but himself to argue his case: &quot;My business activitieswere overwhelming by my own choosing,&quot; he explained to the court.andP;  &quot;Theten-week (Computer-Land) trial in 1985 was something that was very wellpublicized and gave me the reputation of being a big litigator.... Of courseI had partners in it; this wasn't all my own doing.andP;  ...  I individually gotsued for a total of 20 lawsuits all related to the litigation-kind of likethe Howard Hughes will, where 200 people claimed they had the will.andP;  And Igot sued for $1.7 billion.&quot;andM;But revelations about the many lawsuits weren't Martin's only line of attack.andO;He told the court how, after he had won the ComputerLand trial, he discoveredthat his ex-wife had been transformed into a New Age channeler.andP;  He testifiedthat, incredible as it might sound, Susan would occasionally slump over, loseconsciousness, twitch, and take on the voices of the spirits.andM;&quot;There are three spirits,&quot; Martin said matter-of-factly to the judge.andP;  &quot;Twoof them are Achmed and the other one is called Alexandria.&quot;andM;Growing excited, Martin revealed how his ex-wife left the world as we knowit: &quot;Her body went into a paralysis state and she went into this whale calledMica and went around the sea.andP;  .. .  It was an out-of-body experience.&quot;andM;The bizarre testimony was not altogether unexpected.andP;  Before the hearing,Martin had called friends and business associates of his ex-wife and warnedthem that she was having sex with whales.andM;&quot;It's a Christian thing and it's where the Bible says that this is an evilthing,&quot; the devoutly Christian Martin told the court.andP;  &quot;That's where thething about being possessed comes out.andP;  .  .  .  It is eerie.&quot;andM;Martin eagerly volunteered to share his firsthand knowledge of the possessedwith the judge.andP;  &quot;These channels have talked to me.andP;  And I'm happy to talk toyou about some of my discussions I've had with them.andP;  Achmed.andP;  What he's toldme about Susan.andP;  What he's told me about what can happen with my children.&quot;andO;Martin held up a pamphlet on demonism and possession.andP;  &quot;Judge, if you'd onlyread this,&quot; he pleaded.andM;Then, abruptly dropping the topic of demonism, Martin launched into a long,dramatic account of how he had made monthly alimony payments of $2,500,insisting that he had evidence.andP;  As the court went on break, Martin walked tohis canvas bag and started taking papers out of it.andP;  He would pull them out,place them on the table, look around suspiciously, and then stuff them backin.andP;  His shirttail was starting to hang out and he twitched nervously.andM;Finally, Martin returned to the witness stand, branishing papers like asaber.andP;  But all he was waving was a printout generated by his personalcomputer.andP;  He had no proof from his bank that he had paid his alimony.andM;The judge then attempted to introduce Martin's bank account number intoevidence.andP;  &quot;Your Honor, can I go look in my bag again?&quot; Martin askedanxiously.andP;  &quot;I know I brought all that stuff.&quot;andM;Once again, he rummaged through his bag, yanking out papers, casting furtiveglances around the room, and then stuffing the papers back.andM;His personality shifts had become more pronounced.andP;  During breaks he wouldbound gleefully into the hallway, flashing the thumbs-up sign to hisgirlfriend.andP;  Then, back in the courtroom, his ex-wife watched him suddenlycollapse, clutch his head, and moan.andM;Martin pleaded for one more journey to his bag.andP;  But the judge had heardenough and asked the lawyers to clarify what exhibits had been entered intoevidence.andM;&quot;This is not fair to take my children away from me! It's not fair!&quot; explodedMartin.andM;The judge had not decided the custody case.andP;  &quot;Nothing happened,&quot; recallsSusan Musumeci, who felt sympathy for yet fear of the man she still loved.andO;&quot;He came unglued.&quot;andM;&quot;Stop it! Stop it!&quot; Martin's attorney warned him.andM;It's just not fair! She won't let me see them! It's not fair, Your Honor!andO;This is something that we agreed to!&quot;andM;Out in the hallway, Sister Mary Moran paced back and forth.andP;  Before she hadtestified, she had prayed for total honesty, a spiritual honesty.andP;  She wasnervous, but a friend had reminded her, &quot;All you have to do is tell thetruth.&quot;andM;Martin stormed from the courtroom, banging the doors open.andM;Sister Mary's hands flew up.andM;&quot;Oh, John!&quot; she cried in horror.andP;  &quot;He spat on me! john spat on me!&quot; Thespittle ran down the nun's chin, seeped around her cross, and slid onto herblouse.andM;&quot;It was as if she had been violated,&quot; recalls Martin's mother-in-law, whowatched the scene in disbelief.andP;  The elevator doors opened and Martindisappeared with his girlfriend.andM;Shaking, Sister Mary Moran was brought back into the courtroom where hergentle testimony had helped unravel Martin.andP;  Later, she filed a police reportagainst Martin, even going so far as to alert the police in Berkeley when shereturned home.andP;  But her safeguards could not stop the strange phone calls shesoon began to receive.andM;As the lawyers comforted her and wiped the spittle from her face and blouse,the clerk came back with the news.andP;  john Martin was in luck.andP;  The judge hadleft for the day.andM;Millard's AppealandM;Issued in the last days of 1988, the California Appellate Court decision onComputerLand's appeal of the Micro/Vest judgment was long, scholarly, anddirect.andP;  Appellate judge Robert Merrill began his 80-page decision bydiscrediting Millard's &quot;contradictory&quot; testimony and the theory of hisattorney, Shirley Hufstedler, that IMS's alleged death or merger had killedthe Micro/Vest option.andP;  The judge then launched the damning condemnation thatwould be generously quoted in the newspapers:andM;&quot;Millard was constantly tinkering with his various corporations, all ownedentirely by himself and his wife.andP;  He was continuously engaged in a kind ofshell game with them whereby one would be informally merged into another andtheir purportedly separate and distinct individual identities  treated  asnonexistent.&quot;andM;Micro/Vest's judgment was affirmed, and Millard was ordered to pick up thecost of Micro/Vest's defense in his appeal of the decision.andM;Herbert Hafif, Martin's attorney and the celebrated winner of the Micro/Vestsuit, didn't even have time to read Merrill's opinion confirming the originaldecision in Micro/Vest's favor.andP;  Thousands of miles away, across the Pacific,the Hawaiian judge in Martin's bankruptcy case had ruled in favor of Martin'sexecutory-contract strategy.andP;  Millions of dollars' worth of stock that Martinhad sold might soon be his again.andM;Or so it seemed until Hafif had his say.andP;  Hurriedly, the attorney sent off along, angry letter to Millard's former partner, investor Philip Reed:andM;&quot;We may be playing into Martin's hands.andP;  We have a moral obligation to dowhat's right for everybody who had invested money ...andP;  a deal is a deal.andP;  Theway it's going to work is very simple.... We'll make a motion to put the sonof a bitch into final bankruptcy, Chapter 7, so we can get an independenttrustee appointed and fix his wagon good, and then I'm going to attack thebankruptcy itself, because he's lied about the obligations.andP;  He has noobligation of $1.2 billion.andP;  That case was settled.andP;  He really isn't bankruptis what it amounts to.andP;  He has enough stock left of his own to pay all of hisdebts without screwing anybody else.andP;  The only problem for the little bastardis that he won't have any left...andP;  &quot;andM;In-Fighting on Another FrontandM;Micro/Vest turned inward and its investors began spending hundreds ofthousands of dollars defending themselves against john Martin.andP;  Of course, ina sense, Martin was suing himself, as he was a Micro/Vest investor.andP;  Theirony wasn't lost on Micro/Vest's president, John Molinari: &quot;I thought all ofthese people were fighting Millard, and once we disposed of Millard, we'd cutup the pie.andP;  Now the people are fighting among themselves.&quot;andM;While Martin fought Micro/Vest over the elusive ComputerLand riches,Millard's appellate attorneys worked furiously to overturn Micro/ Vest'scourt victory.andP;  But finally, in the spring of 1989, the California SupremeCourt, unmoved by Millard's arguments or the reputation of his high-pricedlawyers, refused to hear the matter, and it seemed that, after more thaneight years, the Instant Billionaire had finally been brought to justice.andM;Millard did not give up so easily.andP;  Marriner andamp; Company, the original makersof the 20 percent ComputerLand note, had sued Micro/Vest and wrested 10percent of the note from the group as settlement.andP;  Millard's chief attorney,Terry Giles, smelled blood and immediately filed suit against Marriner,charging fraud and conspiracy.andP;  But U.S.andP;  District Court judge WilliamSchwarzer quickly dismissed the revenge suit, noting that Millard's newcharges of conspiracy had been raised and lost in the Micro/Vest action.andM;Marriner's attorneys requested federal sanctions against Millard, and judgeSchwarzer punished Millard under Federal Rule 11 and the court's inherentpower to discipline misconduct.andP;  &quot;The Millards' complaint and theiropposition to summary judgment were wholly frivolous, legally unreasonable,and without factual foundation,&quot; wrote the judge, who gave Millard ten daysto pay Marriner's approximately $150,000 of legal fees.andM;Millard's revenge suits appeared to be backfiring.andP;  He was paying double tohear a distinguished judge denounce his motives as &quot;ulterior.&quot; At the verymoment Millard was getting thrown out of court, Martin's legal machinationsseemed to be meeting with success.andP;  He filed an application with thebankruptcy court to authorize spending $25,000 to explore a lawsuit againsthis own attorney, Herbert Hafif.andP;  Martin argued that by settling theMicro/Vest case for an additional 5 percent of ComputerLand's stock, Hafifhad caused a &quot;material erosion and depreciation&quot; of the punitive-damagesjudgment for $141 million.andP;  Martin also sought to collect $19 million inattorneys' fees and dividends waived in the settlements.andM;Investors saw it as a simple case of Martin biting the hand that fed him.andP;  &quot;Idon't think the case would have been settled without Hafif,&quot; said oneinvestor at the time of Martin's charges.andP;  &quot;With his vendetta, Martin byhimself would have blown it [forced ComputerLand into bankruptcy].&quot; Still,most investors were ready to join the feeding frenzy.andP;  &quot;Everybody says, Whatthe hell, what can you lose?&quot; explained another investor when the judgeapproved the investigation.andP;  &quot;If he [Martin] gets anything, we get a piece.&quot;andM;None of this surprised Hafif greatly.andP;  Motivated by speculation, theinvestors saw no moral or social message in defeating Millard and holding himto his word.andP;  Nor did they fight Martin's attempts to extract more money.andO;And as Martin squared off against Hafif, the little investors sat back and,as one said, watched the &quot;cockfight&quot; commence.andP;  This scenario was verydifferent from the one Millard faced.andM;Meanwhile, Back on SaipanandM;In the two years since his sale of ComputerLand stock, Millard claimed tohave doubled his pot of gold to $200 million-plus 16 percent ofComputerLand's stock if he prevailed in another stock fraud case brought byformer employees.andP;  Now that the court had rejected his revenge suits, Millardpursued money by more traditional means.andM;Six months a year, his lawyer, Terry Giles, traveled the world to runMillard's numerous new businesses and monitor his countless investments.andO;Rumors had it that Millard money was in South Africa, Asia, and Europe.andM;Tired of island electricity, Millard had created his own power plant to powerhis computers and run the software with which the self-taught architectelectronically designed his coral compound.andP;  Perched on a bluff on the edgeof the jungle, Millard's two-story residence included a pool, a tennis court,and condos for his two daughters and their husbands.andM;Not satisfied with the shiplike portals typically found in Saipan homes,Millard put in giant, typhoon-proof windows, specially constructed towithstand &quot;coconuts flying at 120 miles an hour.&quot; Around this Xanadu, Millardbuilt a 30-foot coral wall that earned the nickname &quot;The Wall of China&quot; anddrew the animosity of virtually the whole island.andP;  In addition to huge walls,Millard's compound had the latest high-tech security system.andM;Few knew what Millard actually did behind those walls.andP;  He seldom left theisland and almost never traveled for business.andP;  Giles spoke of the Micro/Vestbattle as a catharsis that tore Millard from the business of computers andintroduced him to a new world of opportunities.andP;  &quot;Would the Millards beliving any differently if Micro/Vest hadn't come along?&quot; asked Giles.andP;  &quot;No,you can't live a better lifestyle.andP;  Has he allowed it to affect his sanity?andO;Not at all.&quot;andM;Paying the PriceandM;Meanwhile, Millard had the satisfaction of knowing that even if Micro/ Vestsomeday patched up its differences, the payoff might prove to be illusory.andM;ComputerLand had failed to go public and create a ready market for its stock.andO;The company's improved earnings garnered surprisingly good reviews, butinvestors felt the price was too high, and when Businessland's stockplummeted, a few weeks before the planned 1988 offering, ComputerLand's hopesof going public were dashed.andP;  Timing was everything, and it seemed more thanever that the best time to take ComputerLand public had been years before,during the boom years of 1983 and 1984.andM;Soon a decade would have passed since the &quot;conspiracy&quot; of john Martin andPhilip Reed.andP;  But what had they won? What would they do with a minority 28percent stake in a privately held company? If Millard and Giles had theirwish, Micro/Vest would be stuck with what Millard had spent the last fewyears avoiding: U.S.andP;  taxes.andM;Based on the  150-million valuation of ComputerLand, Micro/ Vest's 28 percentshare had a minimum value of $42 million.andP;  &quot;That means they'll be facingabout $15 million in taxes come April 1990,&quot; predicted Giles.andP;  &quot;No market forthe stock and a $15-million tax bill.&quot; And Giles believed the tax man wouldcall twice-first for the $15-million corporate tax and then for personaltaxes for the investors.andM;Such thoughts brought joy to Millard and Giles, for every snag Micro/ Vesthit tore a new hole in John Martin's legacy.andP;  Millard had always known thereal john Martin: the man who had begun life as john Joseph Musumeci, andwho, under Herbert Hafif s magic legal wand, had briefly seemed the source,the one and only originator of ComputerLand.andP;  But now Martin had turned uponhimself and Millard could rest easily, for it was clear that Martin would beremembered as a bankruptcy artist, a man who sued for profit and spat on agray-haired nun.andM;While Martin chased evil spirits, Millard followed his principles and criedout for justice.andP;  Nor did he run when disaster loomed.andP;  True, the wallsaround his fortress were big, but he could have fled the island and soughtsanctuary in another retreat, perhaps one with equal tax advantages.andP;  ButMillard could not be intimidated.andP;  Standing before his accusers, Millard hadtestified before the government and the grand jury-and he had his supporters.andO;One article in the local newspaper was headlined, &quot;Millard Is an Honest Man.&quot;andM;The End of a DreamandM;Millard's supporters felt some relief when an island convict ratted on afellow prisoner, accusing him of the execution-style murder of Millard'sformer consultant.andM;But even before, when rumor swirled around the execution-style killings, theMillards did not temper their righteous ways or restrain their principles.andO;And when Millard's wife, Pat, sat on the jury in judgment, she stood alonewith her principles, as her husband would have wanted, casting her solitaryvote for conviction.andP;  The accused man went free, and the mystery remainedunsolved.andM;In the wake of Millard's crushing legal defeat and fall from power, Saipanhad seemed a perfect escape, an island paradise without equal.andP;  But thefarther he ran, the more Millard found himself entangled in his own web.andO;When he tried to dodge taxes, the natives responded with the &quot;Millard&quot; taxbill, and when the billionaire cried wolf, death threats and murder were theanswer.andM;But the ultimate challenge to Millard's self-imposed isolation was found inSaipan's local constitution-Article XII, Section 1, to be exact: &quot;Theacquisition of permanent and long-term interests in real property within theCommonwealth shall be restricted to persons of Northern Marianas descent.&quot;andO;Section 3 continued: &quot;Any land transaction in violation of this provisionshaH be void.&quot;andM;Millard had engaged a native agent, one lawsuit alleged, to skirt theprovisions of the constitution barring foreigners from owning land.andM;&quot;Of all Millard's follies, this is the greatest,&quot; said Theodore Mitchell, afiery Saipan lawyer who figured to seize half of Millard's land as his fee ifhis lawsuit against the computer tycoon prevailed.andP;  Millard's Wan of Chinawill have to come down.andP;  He'll have to tear it all down.&quot;andM;But the real walls had crumbled much earlier.andP;  Millard had spent a lifetimebuilding a labyrinth of policies, practices, and principles, regimenting workinto a neat package that he claimed was the essence of life.andP;  He never sawhimself as a computer entrepreneur, but as a philosopher king; his call wasnot to technology or fame or even money.andP;  People followed him because he wasthe father who would make the rules that would not be broken.andM;Back in the heady days when his computer manufacturer was churning out papersales and Computer-Land was siphoning off its capital and resources, Millardstood before his great empire and saw no limits.andP;  Flying into the future in1978, he wrote in his diary that his 13-year goal was to &quot;make a differenceworldwide in business, applied science, politics, and peace.&quot;andM;Twelve years later, stripped of his company and his legacy, Millard's timewas running out.andP;  There had been nothing wrong with his dream.andP;  For a briefmoment he had danced with the computer revolution and led it into the homesand businesses of America.andP;  His mistake was that he imagined he had sculptedthe dancing figures from clay.andP;  And when he saw them stretch and think beyondhis control, he struck out with vengeance and every lawyer money could buy.andM;The last act in the twisted drama was written by attorney Harold Nachtrieb,in a little poem read to the jury in the Micro/Vest trial:andM;The hardest to take from Big Bill Millard Is the way he has treated hisfriends...andM;I ask for your verdict against this  man, With his billions and &quot;stonewall&quot;defense.andP;  The truth hoists Millard an his selfish petard All the &quot;proof&quot; inhis case makes no sense.andM;Sometimes in life the tables are turned So the evil themselves learn theblues.andP;  The evidence here is abundantly clear That the fate for Millard is tolose.andM;The End ...andP;
