The compliance date is extended from July 6, 1989, to January 31,1990. This amendment is necessary due to technical problems and delaysin the certification of PBE and production problems experienced by severalmanufacturers of PBE. By extending the compliance date, air carriers willnot be penalized for the supply problems caused by the delayed certificationand production of PBE units.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>Effective May 22, 1989.

Davis, Project DevelopmentBranch, AFS-240, Air Transportation Division, Office of Flight Standards,Federal Aviation Administration, 800 Independence Avenue, SW., Washington,DC 20591, Telephone (202) 267-8096.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:</T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>The FAA states in the preamble to Amendment No. 121-193, dated June 3,1987, that tests show there is at least one currently available portablesmoke hood device that would essentially provide the required levels ofprotection for crewmembers combating fires. Further, the amendment statesthat the 2-year compliance period for PBE should allow ample time for development,manufacture, and distribution of adequate numbers of new equipment andtime for required training.The statement concerning the 2-year compliance period being ample laterproved to be in error. Although the FAA issued certification standardson April 21, 1987, manufacturers encountered difficulties designing a PBEunit that met those standards. On May 24, 1988, an FAA memorandum was sentto field offices providing guidance and clarification on these problems.In October 1988, after a major product redesign, one vendor's PBE unitdesign was approved. Manufacturing approval for this unit was obtainedin November 1988.Since November 1988, one PBE vendor had discontinued manufacturing theunits due to production problems. Production was resumed in April 1989,with deliveries completed in September 1989. Other PBE vendors are alsoexperiencing production difficulties. In addition, air carriers cannottrain crewmembers without PBE units; therefore, the production delays causethe concurrent problem of air carriers not meeting the compliance datefor crewmember training.If the compliance date is not changed, several air carriers will have toconduct special out-of-cycle installation and training programs. Such programswill require air carriers to remove a large number of aircraft from publicservice. Other air carriers will not achieve compliance under any circumstances.The FAA has determined that the original 2-year compliance period doesnot provide enough time for development, manufacture, and distributionof adequate numbers of PBE units. Although the air carriers have made agood faith effort to comply with the rule, compliance by July 6, 1989,is impracticable. In this case, extension of the compliance date is justifiedand in the public interest. Therefore, the FAA is amending andSection;andSection;121.337(f)and 121.417(d) to change the compliance date in the regulations from July6, 1989, to January 31, 1990.<ITAG tagnum="84">Good Cause Justification for Immediate Adoption</ITAG>Ths amendment is being adopted without notice and public comment procedurebecause delay could have a signficant impact on passenger service withoutincreasing the level of safety. In this case, the compliance problem isa result of certification and production delays forcing manufacturers ofPBE units to delay production and delivery schedules. Thus, air carriercompliance is an industry wide problem making the exemption process impracticaland rulemaking necessary. However, issuance of a notice of proposed rulemakingwould delay the final rule beyond the current compliance date of July 6,1989, forcing many air carriers into noncompliance. Noncompliance, evenfor a short period of time, would require air carriers to remove all noncomplyingaircraft from service until the final rule could be issued. To avoid widespreaddisruption of passenger service, the FAA finds that the compliance dateshould be extended until January 31, 1990. Accordingly, I find that noticeand public procedure are impracticable and contrary to the public interest.In addition, since this amendment relieves a restriction, I find it maybe made effective in less than 30 days.Interested persons are invited to submit such comments as they may desireregarding this amendment. Communications should identify the docket numberand be submitted in duplicate to the address above. All communicationsreceived on or before the close of the comment period will be consideredby the Administrator, and this amendment may be changed in light of thecomments received. All comments will be available, both before and afterthe closing date for comments, in the Rules Docket for examination by interestedparties.<ITAG tagnum="84">Trade Impact Statement</ITAG>The FAA finds that this amendment will have no impact on internationaltrade.<ITAG tagnum="84">Economic Assessment</ITAG>Because the amendment does not impose any cost to operators, the impactof the delay in compliance is expected to be minimal. Accordingly, a fullRegulatory Evaluation is not warranted.<ITAG tagnum="84">Federalism Implications</ITAG>Final RuleThe regulation adopted herein will not have substantial direct effectson the States, on the relationship between the national government andthe States, or on the distribution of power and responsibilities amongthe various levels of government. Therefore, in accordance with ExecutiveOrder 12612, it is determined that this amendment would not have federalismimplications requiring the preparation of a Federalism Assessment.<ITAG tagnum="84">Conclusion</ITAG>This amendment will not have an economic effect on the public. The delayedcompliance date will allow air carriers to keep non-complying airplanesoperating so that passenger service will not be disrupted. Because thedelay in installing PBE units is so short, the effect on passenger safetyis diminutive. Therefore, the FAA has determined that this amendment involvesa regulation which is not major under Executive Order 12291 or significantunder the Department of Transportation Regulatory Policies and Procedures(44 FR 11034; February 26, 1979). Since no small entities would be affectedby the rule, it is certified that under the criteria of the RegulatoryFlexibility Act the rule will not have a significant economic impact, positiveor negative, on a substantial number of small entities. Because of theabsence of any costs attendant with the amendment, the FAA has determinedthat the expected impact of the amendment is so minimal that it does notwarrant a full regulatory evaluation.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 14 CFR Part 121</ITAG>Air safety, Air transportation, Aviation safety, Drug abuse, Narcotics,Safety, Transportation.<ITAG tagnum="84">Adoption of the Amendment</ITAG>Accordingly, Part 121 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (14 CFR 121)is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 121_CERTIFICATION: FLIGHT CREWMEMBERS OTHER THAN PILOTS</ITAG>1.
