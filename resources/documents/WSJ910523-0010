Officials of the General Accounting Office, reporting onthe agency's study, told a congressional hearing that themain organization of state regulators, the NationalAssociation of Insurance Commissioners, &quot;doesn't have theauthority necessary to compel state action or to sustain itsreforms.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Among other things, the investigative arm of Congress saidthe insurance commissioners' association has failed to imposeconsistent accounting practices and requirements for capitaland surplus -- the financial bedrock on which insurancecompanies are built. The agency said state regulators alsohave been reluctant to take action against troubled companiesbefore their problems grow.   The GAO's findings, presented yesterday, are part ofincreasing federal scrutiny of insurance regulation after thecollapse of units of First Executive Corp. and First CapitalHoldings Corp., two unrelated, Los Angeles-based holdingcompanies whose insurance operations have been seized bystate regulators in recent weeks in the nation's biggestinsurance failures ever.   Although they shied away from directly endorsing federalaction, GAO officials flirted in their testimony with justsuch a call. Disputing the idea that regulation by 50 statesoffers a variety of laboratories in which to experiment withcontrols, Richard L. Fogel, assistant controller general ofthe GAO, said, &quot;my view is that we don't want to use alaboratory to deal with {financial} safety and soundnessissues.&quot;   Congressional support for federal action remainsuncertain. But members of the House Subcommittee on Oversightand Investigations repeatedly worried aloud yesterday aboutweaknesses in the current system. &quot;The pretense of protectionis probably worse than no protection at all,&quot; said Rep.Dennis E. Eckart (D., Ohio).   Although insurance regulation has for more than a centurybelonged to state governments, the rising pace of failure andfraud in the insurance industry has raised questions aboutthe adequacy of state oversight. State regulators arethemselves trying to shore up a system in which the qualityof supervision often has appeared to vary markedly from stateto state.   Representatives of the National Association of InsuranceCommissioners argued yesterday before the congressionalhearing, headed by Rep. John Dingell (D., Mich.), that aprocess of &quot;accrediting&quot; individual states' regulatoryprograms and laws will result in sharply higher standards ofoversight across the country.   &quot;Look at the record of the last three months and findanother time in American history when so much {financial}solvency-related legislation was enacted by so many states inso short a time,&quot; James E. Long, president of the associationand North Carolina commissioner of insurance, told the Housepanel.   &quot;We're moving so fast on these issues that some in theinsurance industry are complaining,&quot; Mr. Long said.   The GAO, however, said standards to be adopted by statesin order to become accredited are so vague that &quot;they wouldprovide little more of an appearance of uniformity&quot; betweenstates. Moreover, the GAO said it found that the NationalAssociation of Insurance Commissioners' review process forstate accreditation &quot;has significant shortcomings that castdoubt upon the credibility of the . . . program.&quot;   Only two states have been accredited so far -- New Yorkand Florida. In Florida's case, the written review findingthe state's laws and regulations in compliance withassociation standards covered only half a page, the GAO's Mr.Fogel said.   In an accreditation review of Illinois, still uncompleted,GAO witnesses said reviewers from the insurancecommissioners' association weren't allowed to seeconfidential orders against Illinois-based insurers thatwould have allowed the reviewers to tell how forcefullyregulators in that state were dealing with the companies theyoversee.   Much of the association's efforts to standardizeregulation takes place through so-called model acts --legislation that states are urged to pass. But, of more thana dozen &quot;model acts&quot; put forward since 1980 by theorganization, only one has been passed by more than half thestates, the GAO said.   In testimony at a second congressional hearing yesterday,California Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi told a Housecommittee looking into possible federal steps in pensioninvestments with insurance companies that an Internal RevenueService claim for $643 million in back taxes from ExecutiveLife Insurance Co., the Los Angeles-based unit of FirstExecutive, threatened to undo efforts to restructure thefailed insurer.   &quot;As long as the IRS stands at the head of the line, we areabsolutely inhibited from selling this company,&quot; Mr.Garamendi told the House Subcommittee on Select RevenueMeasures. On Monday, Mr. Garamendi announced intricate termsby which his department proposes to settle the largestinsurance solvency ever.</TEXT></DOC>
