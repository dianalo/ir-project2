Kennedy assassination and whetherreputed Louisiana mob chieftain Carlos Marcello conspired to killthe president.   Jonathan Kwitny, a former investigative reporter for The WallStreet Journal, hosts an hour-long public television special thatconcludes there was a mob conspiracy to kill Kennedy.   The TV report points to evidence that both Kennedy assassin LeeHarvey Oswald and Oswald's killer, Jack Ruby, had connections toMarcello's crime syndicate.   The show airs tonight on New York public television andelsewhere later in the month. It recounts a potpourri of evidencepresented over the years by Kennedy authors, theorists andinvestigators, plus some new evidence unearthed by John H. Davis, acousin of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and author of a new book onMarcello and the JFK slaying.   Marcello, who was a prime target of then-Attorney General RobertF. Kennedy and was temporarily deported by RFK, was mentioned bythe House Select Committee on Assassinations as a possibleconspiracy suspect in the JFK assassination.   The House panel concluded that Kennedy was probably the victimof a conspiracy, breaking sharply with the Warren Commission. Thecommission, appointed by Lyndon Johnson and headed by then-ChiefJustice Earl Warren, concluded that there was no conspiracy, andtwo commission counsels who appear on The Kwitny Report reject themob conspiracy theory as nonsense.   Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., who served as a commission counsel,said evidence presented by the theorists are ``snatches of a littlefact here and there which really add up to nothing.''   ``The Warren Commission turned over every stone and found noconspiracy,'' Specter said.   David Belin, the panel's chief counsel, scoffed at the notionthat Ruby, who gunned down Oswald in a Dallas police station, was amob assassin.   ``Mafia hitmen do not go ahead and kill their targets whenthey're surrounded by police, when they're sure to be apprehendedand face life in prison and possible death,'' he said.   Marcello reportedly hated the Kennedys for the 1961 deportation.A Las Vegas private investigator told the House committee thatMarcello indicated to him a year before the slaying that he wantedto kill the president. ``You cut off the head, the tail dies,'' EdBecker quoted Marcello as saying. The tail allegedly was areference to RFK.   The evidence presented by mob conspiracy theorists include thatOswald's uncle, who helped raise him, worked for the Marcelloorganization, and reports that Oswald at least several times metDavid Ferrie, who was Marcello's personal pilot.   A new piece of evidence uncovered by Davis in his book, titled``Mafia Kingfish,'' is an FBI report quoting a Georgia businessmanwho said shortly after the assassination that he remembered seeingOswald earlier that year accepting cash from a man later identifiedas a top Marcello lieutenant. The author said the FBI neverfollowed up on that lead.   Ruby, according to one FBI report, was not just a Dallasnightclub owner and a small-time operator but an important playerin narcotics trafficking in the Dallas area, which would havefallen under Marcello's turf. And the mob conspiracy theoristspoint to reports that Ruby went to visit Santos Traficante when thereputed Miami mob boss was imprisoned in Cuba.   ``Clearly, Ruby's ties to the Mafia weren't just marginal as theWarren Commission suggested. He was exactly the sort of person tobe assigned to an important and risky mission. And he was not thesort of person who would have suddenly shot Oswald in sorrow forthe Kennedys,'' Kwitny said.   Kwitny points to several eyewitness reports that place Rubyoutside the Dallas police station long before he shot Oswald. Rubysaid he just happened on the police station and killed Oswaldspontaneously, hoping to spare the president's widow the pain ofcoming back to Texas and testifying at Oswald's trial.   Belin dismissed the reports of those who say they saw Rubyearlier. ``Whenever you have a witness to an accident, to anysudden emergency, you're going to get different stories,'' he said.   Kwitny also argues that the late Teamsters boss Jimmy Hoffa wasinvolved with Marcello in the alleged conspiracy, noting Hoffa'shatred of Robert Kennedy for his dogged investigations of unioncorruption. Kwitny also quoted Hoffa's son as saying his father hadknown Ruby since 1939, and law enforcement officials said Hoffa andMarcello were close.   The Kennedy assassination, 25 years ago this Nov. 22, hastriggered a never-ending flow of conspiracy theories, ranging frommob retribution to a CIA scheme to a plot by Cuban leader FidelCastro.   Last week, a British television program claimed three Frenchgangsters killed Kennedy on a contract from American mob figures.   Some, including the House assassinations committee, believethere was a second gunman standing on the grassy knoll as thepresident's motorcade rode through Dallas' Dealey Plaza.   The U.S. government has stood by the Warren Commission findingsand closed its investigation into the slaying.</TEXT></DOC>
