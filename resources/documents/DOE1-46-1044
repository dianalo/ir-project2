Men, recentlyadopting rice as a cash crop, tend to fish and hunt less than other menworking only their subsistence gardens. Sale of fish and game in thevillage is becoming common, and pigs, once raised exclusively for saleto non-Shipibo, are now more regularly eaten and used for attractingagricultural labor. Other research has indicated that cash cropping oftencompetes for workers' time in subsistence and so dietary change usuallyaccompanies changing activity patterns. This paper explores the latterpossibility by examining the relationship between cash cropping, wildmeat procurement, and diet among the Shipibo. Time allocation and foodconsumption data are analyzed statistically to test a mathematical theoryand model which relates indigenous work patterns to diet.</TEXT></DOC>
