(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Breeders, dealers and exotic animallovers flocked to a dairy barn to place their bids on everythingfrom emu and Vietnamese pot-bellied pigs to zebu.   About 1,000 exotic birds and animals were for sale at thetwo-day auction that began Friday.   ``It's a form of insanity,'' animal trader Jim Scott said of thepublic's desire to own unique animals.   Among the animals being auctioned were pygmy goats, cougars,miniature donkeys, llamas, boa constrictors, bear cubs, blue-neckostriches and foxes.   There were emu, which resemble ostriches, and zebu, domestic,oxlike animals. You can even pick up a binturong, a catlike animalfrom Asia, or a Vietnamese pot-bellied pig for about $10,000.   Scott runs one of the largest exotic animal auctions in thecountry in Cape Girardeau, Mo.   Auction organizer Paul Ressler, who says his interest in exoticanimals began as a child, decided to begin his own auction when hediscovered the nearest place to buy exotic animals was in Missouri.   His first auction in October brought in close to $45,000. Hesaid he expected this auction to generate more than $200,000.</TEXT></DOC>
