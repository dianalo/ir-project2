Garcia</HL><DD> 06/02/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> STOCK MARKET, OFFERINGS (STK)STOCK INDEXES (NDX) </IN><TEXT>   The dog days of summer came early to Wall Street as stock prices closed mixed after a sluggish session.    Before trading opened yesterday, traders had high hopes for stock prices because of a big Tokyo rally in bond prices and the dollar that continued in early London trading. But bonds gave up the bulk of their gains yesterday afternoon and the stock market followed, although the dollar stayed relatively strong.    &quot;I was surprised to see how dead (the stock market) was. I thought it would have been livelier&quot; given the early gains in both the dollar and bonds, said Larry Greenwald, co-manager of the equity trading desk at Sanford C. Bernstein andamp; Co. in New York.    He and other traders complained that there was little broad-based interest in buying or selling stocks by institutional investors. &quot;People weren't even picking up their phones,&quot; Mr. Greenwald exclaimed.    The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed down 3.34 at 2288.23. The industrial average had gained about 15 points in the first few minutes of trading.    The Standard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index eased 0.27 to 289.83, and the New York Stock Exchange composite index closed unchanged at 163.48.    Despite the small declines in two of these three widely followed market barometers, advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange had a slight edge over decliners, 817 to 740. Volume slowed to 149.3 million shares from 153.5 million Friday.    The stock market has already been helped by the dollar's rise from its lows last month, which has alleviated concern that the Federal Reserve might have to raise interest rates to support the U.S. currency. But traders said there are still some big question marks facing investors, such as the massive U.S. trade deficit and whether the economy will continue to improve. These issues haven't been resolved by the slight improvement in the dollar.    &quot;Nothing has changed dramatically to cause investors to crawl out of the woodwork, to alter their thinking and rush into the market,&quot; Mr. Greenwald said, noting the lack of interest among investors he saw yesterday.    Thomas Ryan, head of equity trading at Kidder Peabody, said that some investors now are worried that a higher dollar will make U.S. manufactured goods less competitive with products abroad or imported here. This could hurt the more cyclical sectors of the stock market, which many analysts and investors view as likely leaders for the next advance, he added.    Traders aren't the only ones concerned about the sluggish pace of trading recently. Joseph Barthel, a technical analyst with Butcher andamp; Singer in Philadelphia, noted that the net number of daily advancing issues has been dwindling since late March. To him, this indicates that investors may be selling far more of their holdings than declines in the major market indexes might show. These indexes peaked in late March or early April.    Genentech plummeted 11 1/2 to 36 3/4 on volume of more than 14.1 million shares in the over-the-counter market. A Food and Drug Administration advisory panel Friday rejected licensing for Genentech's TPA, a clot-dissolving drug. The stock fell 2 3/4 Friday even before the FDA meeting was completed. Both company officials and investors had high expectations for approval of the drug.    Other biotechnology firms were expecting to ride Genentech's coattails with other anti-clog drugs of their own. The stocks of many of these firms tumbled along with Genentech's. Amgen fell 2 7/8 to 37 3/4, Chiron lost 3 1/2 to 30 1/4, Cetus dropped 2 1/8 to 28 1/2 and Immunex sank 1 1/8 to 22 1/2.    Lubrizol, which owns a 9% stake in Genentech, fell 2 3/8 to 37 7/8. Pharmaceutical stocks were mixed.    C.R. Bard declined 2 1/2 to 42 1/4. Salomon Brothers analyst Lorraine Schwarz told Dow Jones News Service that the failure to get approval for Genentech's TPA could slow the growth of the angioplasty market, where C.R. Bard is heavily involved. In balloon angioplasty, a balloon-tipped catheter is inserted into a coronary artery to open it, and future heart attack victims are expected to be treated with a combination of TPA-type drugs and angioplasty.    Hospital Corp. of America rose 1 1/4 to 48 in active trading. The company's board approved a plan to shed 104 general hospitals to an employee-owned company. Hospital Corp. will received about $1.8 billion in cash plus preferred stock and warrants in the new company. It plans to use the cash to reduce debt and buy back stock.    As prices for precious metals continued to slide, the stocks of gold and other mining companies declined.    Traders saw some spotty buying interest for selected computer stocks, with Hewlett Packard up 1 to 66 1/8 and Digital Equipment up 7/8 to 158 1/4. But International Business Machines, Unisys and Cray Research declined.    Uccel jumped 11 5/8 to 43 5/8. The company agreed to be acquired by Computer Associates International for about $800 million in stock.    Argosystems vaulted 11 3/4 to 36 1/2 in over-the-counter trading. Boeing agreed to acquire Argosystems, which makes advanced electronic systems for military applications, for $37 a share.    Boeing eased 1/8 to 45 1/8. The Wall Street Journal reported yesterday that Boeing could reap a windfall for its role in trying to help Allegis avoid a hostile takeover. Boeing could collect between $109.2 million and $244.5 million under Allegis's plan to pay a $60-a-share distribution. Through an unusual aircraft financing pact, Boeing has $700 million of Allegis notes structured with certain anti-takeover features; the notes are convertible into a 16% stake in the airline and travel company.    Allegis slid 1 3/8 to 85 1/8 active trading. Coniston Partners plans to continue to fight for control of Allegis's board despite the company's proposed $3 billion recapitalization.    E.F. Hutton moved up 3 1/8 to 40. Traders attributed the rise to reports that First Boston might have accumulated a nearly 5% stake in Hutton for a client. In addition, with Smith Barney Harris Upham having agreed to be acquired by Primerica last week, only Hutton and PaineWebber remain as public brokerage firms that are unaffiliated with large financial institutions.    Stop andamp; Shop moved up 1 1/2 to 65 1/4. The stock began climbing last week after the company said it expected to report that profit from continuing operations in the first quarter ended May 24 rose from a year earlier.    Pay 'N Pak Stores fell 1 7/8 to 18 7/8. The company said it has received two acquisition proposals in response to its previously announced call for buyers. One comes from investor Paul Bilzerian, and the other is from a party active in the leveraged buyout field, which Pay 'N Pak declined to identify.    Supermarkets General dropped 6 to 39 1/2. SMG Acquisition, a Merrill Lynch unit, said it has received about 98.75%, or 38,288,457, of the supermarket operator's common shares outstanding. SMG's offer for as many as 32.8 million Supermarkets General shares at $46.75 each expired Friday. </TEXT></DOC>
