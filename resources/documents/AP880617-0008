Karoly Grosz, a reformist picked to his job at a dramatic partyconference last month, arrives here July 20 for the first U.S.visit by a Hungarian leader in 42 years.   Miklos Nemeth of the 11-member ruling Politburo said in aninterview Thursday that his boss hopes to outline to Reagan and tothe two presidential hopefuls his country's experiment in politicalopenness and ``market-oriented socialism.''   Nemeth said the new party leader is primarily seeking to tellAmericans that his country has undertaken political as well aseconomic reforms.   Hungary, burdened with the highest per capita indebtedness inEastern Europe, undertook the reforms one year ago to reduce its$18 billion debt and 18 percent annual inflation.   Nemeth said the political changes adopted at the partyconference are still relatively unknown. These include increaseddemocracy and openness which will be manifested in much broaderparliamentary activity, he said.   ``His visit provides a good opportunity to make this known here.If we're able to succeed in this respect, then the visit will be asuccess,'' said Nemeth, who was attending a conference of the U.S.Information Agency here.   Nemeth is the first Eastern European delegate to attend theannual USIA forum of international opinion leaders.   Grosz served as prime minister, the No. 2 job in his country,until the conference which brought outspoken reformers such asNemeth into the ruling elite and ousted aging party leader JanosKadar, 76. Eight members of the Politburo were dropped in thereshuffle.   Nemeth said Grosz hopes to strengthen economic ties with theUnited States. The Hungarian parliament is considering laws thatwould liberalize foreign investment and permit more joint venturesin Hungary, enabling more business with the United States, he said.   ``We're beginning to build a market-oriented socialism,'' hesaid. ``This has never happened in a socialist country. It is a newexperiment.''   Asked whether Hungary wants other Eastern European countries toadopt this system, Nemeth said, ``each government is responsiblefor its own model'' although ``we would be very glad if othercountries learn from our experience as we study other countries'experiences.''   He said Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev's more flexible economicpolicies are ``a very promising development.''   Nemeth has meetings scheduled with Michel Camdessus, director ofthe International Monetary Fund, and Barber Conable, the head ofthe World Bank.   Hungary owes some money to the IMF, but 40 percent of its debtis to Japanese banks. Last year Hungary also received about $580million from the West German Federal Bank.   Nemeth said he had met for a roundtable discussion Wednesdaywith State Department experts on Eastern Europe and described tothem his country's reforms.   Nemeth, an economist, attended Harvard University for one yearon a visitors' program. He speaks English although he preferred touse an interpreter during the interview, saying he was tired anddidn't want to make mistakes.</TEXT></DOC>
