Defense Secretary Dick Cheney announced the firing of Gen.Michael Dugan, chiding him for using &quot;poor judgment&quot; anddisclosing classified information in remarks he made to a fewreporters who traveled with him on a visit to Saudi Arabia.Mr. Cheney curtly said that the general won't get another jobbut &quot;will be retired.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Gen. Dugan's comments, published in the Washington Postand the Los Angeles Times on Sunday, have produced thebiggest embarrassment to the administration since the startof the Gulf crisis on Aug. 2. While his blunt remarks couldhelp convince Saddam Hussein of American resolve, they alsoraise questions about whether the administration intends toabide by an American prohibition on assassination of foreignleaders. And Gen. Dugan's disclosure that some American B-52bombers are being equipped with Israeli-built missiles couldcause political problems in the Arab world.   Meanwhile, President Bush gave a mixed review of theeffectiveness of international economic sanctions on Iraq,which are the cornerstone of his strategy for forcing Iraq towithdraw from Kuwait. Mr. Bush said that the sanctions areworking &quot;to some degree.&quot; In remarks at the White House toout-of-town reporters, the president added: &quot;I can't tell youdefinitively how effective they are at this minute.&quot;   Mr. Bush said the sanctions are choking off virtually allIraqi oil income, but he also said that ensuring that nogoods enter Iraq is &quot;hard to do in terms of overflights andsome countries that seem to be more willing than others toavoid the sanctions.&quot; However, he said he believes that Iranis complying with the trade embargo.   Mr. Bush's remarks are significant because his analysis ofthe effectiveness of economic sanctions will be an importantfactor when he determines whether to move from economicpressure to military force in order to push Iraq out ofKuwait.   But the president also may have been speaking in an effortto influence deliberations by the permanent members of theUnited Nations Security Council, where new steps to tightenthe sanctions are being considered. According to a U.S.official, three options are being discussed: extending theembargo to include air shipments to Iraq; applying sanctionsagainst nations that are violating the United Nations-imposedembargo of Iraq, and approving a resolution calling on U.N.members to reduce Baghdad's diplomatic presence in theirnations.   &quot;There's no set mix of these items,&quot; the official said.&quot;It could be one or all.&quot; President Bush explicitly endorsedthe idea of an embargo on some Iraqi air traffic, saying thatFrench President Francois Mitterrand has advanced such aproposal and that &quot;I would be prepared to work with anybodyto tie that additional knot in the sanctions.&quot;   Mr. Bush also said he &quot;absolutely&quot; regrets hisadministration's moves to prevent Congress from passinglegislation to impose economic sanctions on Iraq in the weeksbefore it invaded Kuwait. He said there was &quot;some reason&quot; tothink at the time that improving relations with Iraq wouldmoderate its behavior, but added that &quot;if everybody had thebenefit of total hindsight, why, you'd go back and say, `Thisdoesn't make much sense.'&quot;   Also yesterday, the State Department said that after theweekend arrival of two chartered aircraft carrying 409Americans and their non-American family members, there noware about 1,280 American citizens in Kuwait and 170 in Iraq.   State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said thatanother flight carrying American citizens and their familiesfrom Kuwait and Iraq is scheduled to leave Kuwait tomorrowand arrive at the Raleigh-Durham, N.C., airport on Thursday.He added that &quot;we're looking into another possible flightafter this.&quot;   Mr. Boucher also said the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad reportedthis past weekend that two American men and two otherWesterners were picked up Friday in Kuwait by Iraqi troops.He said this brings to about 82 the number of Americancitizens who have been rounded up by the Iraqi government.   The firing of Gen. Dugan illustrates the fine line theBush administration is walking in trying to show Iraq that itis seriously considering military conflict without givingaway too many military plans in the process.   &quot;As a matter of policy, we never talk about the selectionof specific targets for potential air strikes,&quot; Mr. Cheneysaid at a news conference in which he explained Gen. Dugan'sfiring. In addition, Mr. Cheney said, &quot;we never talk abouttargeting specific individuals who are officials of othergovernments.&quot; Trying to kill foreign officials during anattack could be considered attempted assassination, whichwould violate an executive order President Bush and hispredecessors have issued barring political killings.   In his comments to reporters, Gen. Dugan said that U.S.military planners have concluded that massive bombing,including attacks of Baghdad, would be the most effectiveoption for forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait if fightingerupts. Moreover, the general said that in addition to usualtargets such as Iraqi air defenses and military industries,he had asked planners to find targets important to Iraqiculture and society.   Mr. Cheney didn't attack the veracity of Gen. Dugan'sremarks, but objected to Gen. Dugan's making the threats sobaldly in for-the-record interviews. &quot;Given the extremedelicacy of the current situation, it's incumbent upon seniorofficials to be discreet in their public statements,&quot; Mr.Cheney said.   Though Gen. Dugan's statements were similar to those madeprivately by some other officials, they went beyond whatofficials have said even on a not-for-attribution basis.   Gen. Dugan's remarks could both help and harm U.S.interests in different ways. To get Saddam Hussein towithdraw from Kuwait, military strategists say, the U.S. mustconvince the Iraqi leader that it is ready to destroy what hevalues most. But by suggesting an American willingness toconsider widespread destruction of Iraq's most importantcity, the comments also seem to undercut Mr. Bush's argumentin recent weeks that he doesn't want to harm the Iraqi peoplebut only their unelected leader.   Mr. Cheney said he would replace Gen. Dugan, who had onlytaken over as chief of staff three months ago, with Gen.Merrill McPeak, who is currently commander-in-chief ofPacific air forces.   In his remarks to reporters, Mr. Bush also reiterated hisadministration's belief that there isn't any reason to drawdown oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve because of thecutoff of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil shipments.   &quot;I think that when you have a real shortage of a productor you see an external event that is going to guarantee thatthere be a shortage, then would be the time when you mostcertainly should use&quot; the strategic reserve, Mr. Bush said.&quot;It is my judgment that there isn't such a shortage at thistime.&quot; He said that price increases in petroleum productsresult from speculation that wouldn't be damped by a symbolicdraw-down of some reserve oil.   Mr. Bush also said that the current crisis won't prompthim to reconsider decisions he made this year postponingoffshore oil exploration in large areas near the West Coastand tracts off the East Coast. But he made a renewed pitchfor tax incentives to encourage domestic oil explorationelsewhere, particularly in small wells that are economicallymarginal.   Mr. Bush again praised cooperation from other nations inthe confrontation with Iraq, and there were further signs ofcooperation in both the Middle East and Europe. The SaudiArabian government appears ready to provide Egypt and Syriaeconomic assistance totaling nearly $3 billion a year inreturn for their military support against Iraq, Saudiofficials said.   Details of the long-term arrangement haven't beenannounced, but the officials said the aid would be inaddition to more than $10 billion the Saudis previouslyagreed to provide to help defray the costs of deploying U.S.forces in the region. Saudi Arabia also is prepared to paythe full cost of airlifting another 10,000 or so Syrianforces, which are expected to join about 3,000 Syrianspreviously sent to help Saudi Arabia.   At the same time, European Community foreign ministersannounced a mass expulsion of Iraqi military personnel andset limits on the movements of Iraqi diplomats who remain. Inaddition, the Western European Union, which links nine ECcountries in a joint defense pact, is expected to announcefurther joint military measures today.</TEXT></DOC>
