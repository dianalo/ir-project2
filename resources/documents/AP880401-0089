TATRO</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Israel reopened the occupied territories today,a holy day for Jews, Christians and Moslems, after a three-dayclosure. Arab reports said two Palestinians were killed in a clashin the West Bank.   Despite the tensions, hundreds of Christian pilgrims crowded thenarrow streets of Jerusalem's Old City, carrying wooden crosses andsinging psalms along the Via Dolorosa to commemorate Good Friday,the anniversary of Jesus' crucifixion.   Dozens of Israeli riot police stood guard along the route.Authorities were concerned that violence could be timed to disruptEaster celebrations or the eight-day Jewish Passover holiday, whichstarts this evening.   Arab journalists said demonstrations erupted in Idna near theWest Bank town of Hebron after noon prayers on the Moslem Sabbath.They said Jamal Tamiri, 20, died after he was hit in the head witha tear gas canister and Ishak Nimr Salameh, 18, was killed when aburst of five bullets hit him in the chest.   Army spokesmen said they were checking the report.   An Israeli police lieutenant in Jerusalem's Old City was stabbedin the stomach and taken to a hospital, apparently by a Moslemworshiper, police said.   ``Suddenly, there was a scuffle, and police pulled someone aside_ an Arab,'' said Heski Rohr, a television sound man who witnessedthe incident.   The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem canceled threepre-Easter processions scheduled for today and Saturday out ofconcern for the pilgrims' safety and due to an expected sharp dropin the number of tourists.   Underground Palestinian leaders called in a leaflet forPalestinians to stage demonstrations, including a general strikeMonday, to protest the latest peace mission of Secretary of StateGeorge P. Shultz, who arrives Sunday.   The PLO-signed leaflet appealed to ``all the Arab world to blockShultz's plan and to stop him from killing the uprising.''   It also demanded that Palestinian politicians avoid meeting withShultz during his visit.   Extra troops continued to patrol the occupied West Bank and GazaStrip today. In recent months, violence regularly has broken outafter Friday Moslem prayers.   At the Nasr Mosque in the West Bank town of El Bireh, about 35women marched down a street, chanting ``by our blood we will redeemPalestine.''   The army fired tear gas canisters to break up the march, butsome drifted back onto the soldiers.   The closure was lifted at 3:00 a.m. (8 p.m. EST Thursday),allowing West Bank residents to travel out of their towns andvillages and lifting a curfew in the Gaza Strip, where five-hournightly curfews were to continue.   Journalists could again travel freely in the occupied lands.During the closure, they were only allowed in in organized poolsand under army escort.   In Ramallah, stores and the central vegetable market opened forthe first time since the three-day closure was imposed Monday night.   Soldiers have forced stores to shut during hours that PLOleaflets say they should open. Curfews, road closures and financialrestrictions have also made it difficult for businessmen to operate.   Abed Hamouri, co-owner of a fleet of 24 commuter buses, saidIsraeli economic measures designed to pressure middle classPalestinians failed to have any impact on underground activists.   ``The Israelis are talking to the people who do not have thesolution in their hands. The solution is not in the hands of thepeople who own shops,'' Hamouri said.   The security measures were adopted in anticipation of majorriots Wednesday marking Land Day, an annual day of protestcommemorating the deaths of six Arabs in a 1976 clash over landconfiscation.   Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir, speaking to Jewish settlersduring a tour of the West Bank on Thursday, referred to the riotersas ``grasshoppers.''   ``We say to them from this hilltop, and from the perspective ofa 1,000-year past, that in our eyes they are like grasshopppers.The Jewish people, thousands of years old, will overcome itsenemies, no longer needing men of the underground and fighters intunners,'' Shamir said, standing on the hilltop site of thebiblical King Herod's Palace at Herodion.   Four Palestinians were killed Wednesday and dozens wounded, butofficials said the clampdown had made some gains in the struggle toquell the four-month-old Arab uprising in the territories Israelseized in the 1967 Middle East war.   Before today's violence, 124 Palestinians had been killed andhundreds more wounded in unrest that began Dec. 8.   One Israeli soldier has died in rioting and three civilians werekilled by Palestinian guerrillas in a bus hijacking. Israel Radiosaid 40 Israeli soldiers have been injured in riots since Dec. 8.One was paralyzed and another was in a coma.   Israel radio said 750 Palestinians had been jailed since theuprising began under detention orders that allow up to six months'imprisonment without trial.</TEXT></DOC>
