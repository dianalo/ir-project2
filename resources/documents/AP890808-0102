Officer Tomas Echartea from the rural town of Groesbeck, who wasworking on an undercover drug investigation for police in suburbanUniversity Park, told reporters he pretended to be sick to avoidparticipating in the attack by men he was investigating.   ``You don't want to ruin your credibility'' with suspects, hetold The Dallas Morning News. ``If it had been a life-threateningsituation, I'd have blown my cover. I'd've had to. You just can'tlet someone be killed.''   Dallas police said they were unaware of the incident but wouldinvestigate to find the woman to determine if she wants to presscharges.   Detectives will also ask Echartea to give them a full account,Deputy Chief Ray Hawkins said.   ``I think he had some obligation as one human being to anotherto help her as best he could,'' Hawkins said. ``All women, evenprostitutes, have a right not to be raped.''   Echartea said the incident occurred in June while he was workingon a two-month investigation. The operation ended with the arrestsof four University Park employees on charges of selling drugs.   In Groesbeck, a small town town about 60 miles south of Dallas,Police Chief Chuck Walker defended Echartea's actions, saying hecould not have intervened without risking his life and theinvestigation.   ``He can't put himself in a life-threatening situation,'' Walkersaid. ``If it were a life-threatening situation, his cover wouldhave been immaterial then.''   Dallas County District Attorney John Vance said he did not knowif state law requires Texas officers to intervene in felonies theyobserve. ``I think it would be good if he did, but I don't believethe law requires it of him,'' Vance said.   Dallas police spokesman Ed Spencer said the department does nothave a written policy requiring undercover officers to try to stopfelonies.</TEXT></DOC>
