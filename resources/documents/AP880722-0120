He introduced Dukakis as ``a man I've come to know, to respect... a man I've come to ... love because of his own sensitivity tofamily,'' Jackson added: ``I bring to you a man I plan to watch upclose ... when he becomes ... the next president of the UnitedStates _ Michael Dukakis.''   The group erupted in applause and shouts of ``Duke, Duke.''   ``We're going to need you, we want you, we can't win withoutyou,'' Dukakis responded.   Jackson issued a blistering attack on the Reagan record andcalled for Democratic unity. A progressive agenda will be won with``a combination of street heat and leadership,'' he said.   He promised Dukakis, ``There will be enough heat to cook ourmeat and enough heat for George Bush to get out of the kitchen.''   Jackson recalled that when Lyndon B. Johnson was added to theticket in 1960, some civil rights activists were concered. ButJohnson rose to the occasion, Jackson said.   Turning to Bentsen, he said, ``In a real sense, your occasion isnow... You ask us to trust you. All we can ask of anyone is thatthey not betray that trust.''   Jackson repeated that he wants neither a job nor a title withthe Dukakis operation. ``I want to serve, free to serve at my ownpace, free to serve, free to challenge,'' he said.   He said he expects his own relationship with the ticket willinfluence some policies. ``What does it mean to me in practicalterms?'' Jackson asked. ``The contras have lost a vote.''   Bentsen _ who has voted for aid to the Nicaraguan rebels _ andDukakis politely joined the applause as delegates chanted, ``Nocontra aid.''   Jackson, who had been the last survivor in the Democratic fieldagainst Dukakis, had endorsed the ticket at Thursday night'sclosing session of the party's convention. At the end of the longroad, Jackson said, ``I feel fantastic.''   But it was clear he would have to do some selling to whip upenthusiasn for the Dukakis-Bentsen ticket.   Jesse Jackson embraced the Democratic ticket he had wanted tohead and gave the Democrats the unity send-off they sought forvictory in the November election.   As he strode from the podium where he joined Democratic nomineeMichael Dukakis on Thursday night, Jackson said, ``We have a goodticket and a good team. And if the unity that is expressed heretonight is sustained and expands, we will win and we will deserveto win.''   Asked his own feeling at the close of the convention, he said,``I feel fantastic.''   With the dust hardly settled from his own presidential campaign,Jackson today was looking ahead to new political ventures. Hecalled a meeting today of his 1,200 delegates to include them inhis plans to campaign for the Dukakis ticket, raise money for hisown political action committee and register voters.   It appeared Thursday night that he would have to do some sellingto whip up enthusiasm among some delegates for the team of Dukakisand Sen. Lloyd Bentsen of Texas.   Signs reading ``No Contra aid'' printed up by members of theVermont delegation were held up by several Jackson delegates aroundthe hall. Dukakis opposes aid to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels,while Bentsen has voted for it in the past.   ``He's against peace,'' said Vermont delegate Cindy Milstein whomentioned several pro-military stands by Bentsen.   But Jackson officials circulated a statement from him to hisdelegates before the vice presidential vote, urging support ofBentsen. The brief statement said that while he disagrees withDukakis and Bentsen on some issues, ``our interest converges inbuilding a coalition to beat the Republicans this fall.''   Jackson's appearance in the hall later was clearly appreciated.At the mention of his name by Dukakis, a deafening cheer went upfrom both Jackson and Dukakis delegates. At first Jackson satunnoticed in a VIP box with former President Jimmy Carter, anuncustomary role for Jackson, until Dukakis waved to him. Jacksonstood, gave a thumbs up and the delegates erupted in emotion.</TEXT></DOC>
