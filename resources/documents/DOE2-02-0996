<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-02-0996 </DOCNO><TEXT>An assessment has been performed of the consequences of fuel failure ina fast reactor and some predictions have been made on the behaviour offailed fuel pins at various levels of fuel burn-up. The analysis hasrequired a detailed assessment of the chemical reaction between liquidsodium and urania-plutonia solid solutions together with an evaluationof the chemical constitution of irradiated fuels. The consequences ofleaving breached fuel pins within the reactor core are discussed in termsof the swelling of the fuel and the contamination of the primary coolant.Although early-in-life failures could be tolerated, the failure of ahighly irradiated pin could result in significant swelling of the fueland necessitate removal of the fuel assembly affected.</TEXT></DOC>
