<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-12-0161 </DOCNO><TEXT>Thin films of YBaCuO compounds have been fabricated in a UHV system equippedwith three independent diode RF plasmas. The targets are Yttrium, Bariumand Copper oxides. The plasma composition is a mixture of Ar and O. Thesubstrates used are silicon wafers, SrTiO{sub 3} monocrystals, and sinteredpolycrystalline ZrO{sub 2}. The deposition is achieved by sequentialexposure to each target, with an accurate timing controlled by fast shuttersand monitored by in situ real time ellipsometry. Grazing incidence X-rayreflectometry is used to check the thicknesses measured by real timeellipsometry. We have investigated in detail the interface reactionsbetween the various oxides during deposition. Our tentative major conclusionis that, although the stoichiometry can be accurately controlled, thereactions between Copper and Barium and Yttrium oxides are such thatthe film is amorphous. This intrinsic limitation has the consequencethat a high temperature annealing is always necessary for achieving crystallineYBa{sub 2}Cu{sub 3}O/sub 7-x/. Because a reaction always occurs withthe substrate, thin films with a thickness not greater than 0.1 {mu}mare markedly peturbed by this substrate reaction and cannot be obtainedin the superconducting phase.</TEXT></DOC>
