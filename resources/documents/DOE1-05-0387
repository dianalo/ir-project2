The detectors discussedare: Higgs particle detector, Solid State Box detector, SMART detector,muon detection system, and forward detector. Also discussed are triggeringstrategies for these detectors, high field solenoids, barium fluorideoption for EM calorimetry, radiation damage considerations, and costestimates. (LSP)</TEXT></DOC>
