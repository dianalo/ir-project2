Darman, whose nomination as director of the Office of Managementand Budget could be approved by the Senate this week, spent most ofhis five hours before the committee on Thursday fencing withDemocrats eager to find holes in Bush's campaign pledge of no newtaxes.   But the 45-year-old former investment banker, deputy treasurysecretary and White House aide also gave some indications of whatBush's revisions to the budget former President Reagan presented onJan. 9 will look like.   And he gave hints as to how the new president will honor hiscampaign pledges to support education, research and otherpriorities, while grappling with the federal deficit. Theadministration says the imbalance would reach $127 billion this yearwithout savings, well above the $100 billion cap set by theGramm-Rudman deficit reduction law.   Asked about education spending, Darman responded, ``You'll see alot of emphasis on the role the federal government can play inproviding leadership in regard to education.''   But in the next breath he said there would be only a ``modestincrease'' in federal education spending. He suggested that,instead, the government could provoke improvements in education byother, unspecified means.   He said the budget would provide tax breaks and other incentivesto spur research and development.   He said that in looking for savings, Bush would not reduce thegiant Social Security program. But he said the growth of spendingfor Medicare, which provides medical services for the elderly andhandicapped, would be reined in. He provided no figures.   Defense, which accounts for more than one-quarter of Reagan's$1.15 trillion budget, will not receive the boost of 2 percentgrowth, above inflation, that Reagan gave it, Darman said. Again, heoffered no specifics.   He insisted that Bush's flexible freeze plan _ a brew of spendingincreases that rises no faster than inflation, along with no taxincreases _ could reduce the deficit and eventually balance thebudget.   But he left the door open to retain the $13 billion in assetsales, user fee increases and other revenue raisers that Reaganinserted into his spending plan. Darman insisted that none of thoseitems can be considered taxes, a viewpoint Democrats in Congress arealready disputing.   Darman said the blueprint would be longer than the 12-pagedocument submitted by President Nixon when he succeeded LyndonJohnson in 1969, but would not be as comprehensive as the six-volumebudget Reagan submitted earlier this month.   Bush's document, Darman said, would specify ``what the particularprograms are he wishes to emphasize.''   Those yet-to-come details are what Congress and the newadministration will wrestle over for months to come.</TEXT></DOC>
