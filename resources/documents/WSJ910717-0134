Chairman David Boren of the Senate Intelligence Committeesaid the panel would pursue a grant of immunity for AlanFiers, who oversaw the agency's Central American operationsin the mid-1980s and who last week pleaded guilty to chargesof withholding information from Congress.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, a subpoena was authorized for Clair George,the CIA's former deputy director for operations, but nodecision is expected to be made on immunity for him untilIran-Contra independent counsel Lawrence Walsh has completedwhatever case he is making against Mr. George, who was Mr.Fiers's superior.   The decision to postpone the hearings, now scheduled tobegin Sept. 16, follows behind-the-scenes discussions betweencommittee leaders and the Bush administration, which lastnight concurred with the decision. &quot;A start-and-stop hearingand confirmation process dragging out over a number of weekswould not be fair to Mr. Gates,&quot; said White House spokesmanMarlin Fitzwater.   The statement reflects a calculated retreat after demandsby President Bush for quick action, and administrationofficials said the committee spurned a White House request tofree Mr. Gates to speak out publicly to defend himselfagainst any future charges that might arise during a break inthe hearings. Traditionally, congressional committees requirenominees to maintain a public silence outside the committeeroom on issues pertaining to their confirmation until theprocess is complete.   Mr. Gates met privately late Monday with Sen. Boren, anOklahoma Democrat, and Sen. Frank Murkowski of Alaska, theranking Republican on the panel. As a practical matter, theWhite House needs time itself to regroup and prepare its casefor the nomination.   Mr. Fiers's recent guilty pleas have provoked renewedinterest in the role played by CIA officials -- including Mr.Gates -- in the sales of arms to Iran and the use of profitsto supply Nicaraguan guerrillas. Mr. Gates served then asdeputy to William Casey, the late CIA director and a centralfigure in the scandal. Mr. Fiers's court statements indicatethat people in the agency's operations division had knowledgeas well of both the diversion of funds and supply operation.   Mr. George is among those implicated in Mr. Fiers'spleadings, and a central issue is whether Mr. Gates failed asdeputy director to oversee what was happening in the agency.Mr. Gates has repeatedly denied knowledge of the diversion,but evidence collected by House and Senate IranContraCommittees in 1987 indicates that he received early warningsfrom those under him in the summer and fall of 1986.   As significant, there is interest in a White House staffmemo describing the agenda for a May 1986 meeting between thethen-national security adviser, Adm. John Poindexter, andMessrs. Casey and Gates regarding a proposal for the CIA tolease a ship controlled by the secret arms-supply network.The vessel, a small coastal freighter, had been purchased for$312,000 in April with funds generated partly by the sale ofarms to Iran. Adm. Poindexter's aide, Marine Lt. Col. OliverNorth, was seeking to lease it to the CIA for $1.2 millionfor six months.   The memo makes clear that the freighter -- dubbed &quot;Ollie'sship&quot; -- was already known to CIA officials and Mr. Casey wascoming to the meeting with Mr. Gates with a briefing paperprepared by the CIA on the proposed lease. Though there is noevidence Mr. Gates knew then of how the ship was financed,the prospect of such a large asset's being put forward byCol. North's network indicated the size of the operationbeing run from the White House.   Among those opposing the proposed lease arrangement --which was ultimately squelched -- was Mr. George, who servedunder Mr. Gates but often reported directly to Mr. Casey. Theformer operations director deeply distrusted some of theprivate operatives used in Col. North's network, and his owntestimony to Iran-Contra investigators is revealing of thetension facing CIA officials at the time. At one level,officers sought to shield themselves from knowledge of theoperation, but at the same time there was professionalconcern that the administration was relying on people who hadbeen associated with the renegade former CIA agent, EdwinWilson.   Apart from Mr. George, the committee also authorized asubpoena for the testimony of a senior CIA officialidentified by Mr. Boren as Jerry Gruner. Mr. Gruner,currently serving overseas, is one of two CIA officials, aswell as Mr. George, cited in a government statementdescribing those who Mr. Fiers said knew about the diversionbefore it became public.   The statement, issued in connection with Mr. Fiers'sguilty plea, doesn't specifically name Mr. Gruner anddescribes him only as Mr. Fiers's superior and chief of theCIA's Latin American division. The statement says Mr. Fierstold the CIA superior about the diversion in the summer of1986 and the official instructed him to report theinformation to Mr. George.   William Hundley, a Washington lawyer who represents Mr.Gruner, disputed the government's account and said his clientdidn't learn of the diversion from Mr. Fiers until &quot;the wholematter started to unravel&quot; in the fall of 1986. Mr. Hundleysaid that if Mr. Gruner were subpoenaed by the IntelligenceCommittee, &quot;I would ask the committee to defer until hisstatus with the independent counsel is a little clearer.&quot;   ---   Edward T.
