U.S. Rep. Henry B. Gonzalez, chairman of the House Banking,Finance, and Urban Affairs Committee, which is conducting a fieldhearing on thrift problems, has been critical of M. Danny Wall, thechairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board.   Gonzalez' comments seeking the resignation came after testimonyby Frederick D. Wolf, assistant comptroller geneneral of the GeneralAccounting Office, who said that the handling of the savings andloan problems could have been handled in a less-costly manner.   Wolf said the deficit for the Federal Savings and Loan InsuranceCorp. had at least quadrupled between 1987 and 1988 when it begantakeover of insolvent thrifts.   ``Those deals were terribly expensive and our thinking is thatthere could have been more ways you could have done it lesscostly,'' he said.   ``We are still in the process of doing the audit and the numbermay be higher than lower,'' Wolf said.   Gonzalez interrupted Wolf's testimony to say that the new figurescontradict testimony by Wall and others before the committee earlierthis year.   ``I just feel under these circumstances, the Congress, andtherefore the public, have been disgracefully misinformed. Thepersons responsible should step aside at this time,'' Gonzalez said,reiterating his criticism of Wall.   Federal and state officials are scheduled to testify in thetwo-day hearing looking into the savings and loan crisis. Wall isnot among the witnesses scheduled to testify.   So far this year, 118 savings and loan institutions have beentaken over by federal regulators, including 36 in Texas.   Wolf said that he believed the administration's projection tospend $100 billion to rectify the thrift crisis was adequate.</TEXT></DOC>
