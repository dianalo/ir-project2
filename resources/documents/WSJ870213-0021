The New York grand jury, whose existence hadn't been disclosed previously by federal officials, is the third such panel trying to unravel Mr. Marcos's far-flung wealth. It is attracting the largest share of federal investigative resources and government attention, according to law enforcement officials.    The New York grand jury wants to determine whether Mr. Marcos or his associates violated U.S. laws barring transfer or investment of funds obtained through fraud in another country, according to congressional sources and attorneys familiar with the case. Such a case would involve a new legal theory about potential criminal liability by Mr. Marcos.    The four Manhattan properties have been the focus of civil litigation between the Philippine government and a number of middlemen who allegedly acted on behalf of the Marcos family.    Yesterday, a Security Pacific Corp. unit said that it has &quot;begun some steps&quot; to foreclose on three of the four properties. Security Pacific Mortgage andamp; Real Estate Services lent a total of more than $105 million on the three buildings. A Security Pacific spokeswoman said the owners of the building have been in default on the mortgage loan &quot;for a while.&quot;    Mr. Marcos and his attorneys couldn't be reached for comment yesterday, but on previous occasions the Marcos family has denied that it owns or controls the Manhattan properties. Two New York real estate developers, however, have told congressional investigators that they helped to purchase and manage three of the properties on behalf of Mr. Marcos and his wife, Imelda.    The New York grand jury also is trying to determine whether Mr. Marcos or his associates violated U.S. law by temporarily shifting certain funds to New York before transferring them to Switzerland, according to a House Foreign Affairs Committee aide familiar with the issue. Philippine investigators have estimated that Mr. Marcos's foreign holdings total at least $1.5 billion.    The former Philippine leader, meanwhile, continues to resist subpoenas to testify before a separate federal grand jury in Alexandria, Va., even though a U.S. medical examination earlier this month determined Mr. Marcos was well enough to appear, according to law enforcement sources.    Justice Department officials said talks to schedule an appearance are continuing, but no decision has been reached. Mr. and Mrs. Marcos were subpoenaed to appear before the panel last December, but their attorneys objected, citing Mr. Marcos's poor health.    The dispute now involves the scope of the questioning of Mr. Marcos before the grand jury, a law enforcement official said.    The Alexandria grand jury has been looking since 1984 into allegations that associates of Mr. Marcos received millions of dollars of kickbacks involving U.S. military aid to the Philippines. Aides to Mr. Marcos have asserted that the ousted ruler and his wife aren't targets of the Virginia investigation. The Justice Department has declined to comment.    The same grand jury also has subpoenaed a daughter of Mrs. Marcos, the daughter's husband, former Philippine Army chief of Staff Gen. Fabian Ver and Benjamin Romualdez, a former Philippine ambassador to the U.S. and brother to the former Philippine First Lady, according to U.S. officials.    Meanwhile, in Pittsburgh, another federal grand jury is examining allegations that Mr. Marcos and his associates received millions of dollars in kickbacks for awarding a contract to have Westinghouse Corp. build a nuclear power plant in the Philippines during the 1970s. A previous grand jury investigation looking into the transaction was dropped for lack of evidence, but new information that came to light after Mr. Marcos was ousted in February 1986 prompted the Justice Department to renew the probe.    Still another federal investigation is under way in California, where federal prosecutors are looking into other aspects of Mr. Marcos's finances and those of his former aides, including former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile. </TEXT></DOC>
