Belin</HL><DATE>01/16/92</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A13</SO><RE>NORTH AMERICA (NME)UNITED STATES (US)</RE><LP>   The Warner Brothers-Oliver Stone film &quot;JFK&quot; claims thatthe U.S. government covered up the truth about theassassination of President Kennedy. The evidence does notsupport this position. I should know. I have more firsthandknowledge about the key witnesses and physical evidence ofthe assassination of President Kennedy than anyone else. I amthe only person in the world who has had access to everythingin the Warren Commission files and CIA files about theassassination.   This newspaper has also challenged the veracity of &quot;JFK.&quot;In its Dec. 27 editorial, the Journal accurately concludedthat what Oliver Stone &quot;is basically selling . . . ispolitical grotesquery itself.&quot; Unfortunately, the Journalalso made some serious errors in its analysis of the Kennedyassassination. The Journal has made an assertion that ispatently false, alleging that &quot;. . . the Warren CommissionReport . . . was less intent on truth than in unifying thenation, and now the nation pays a price in Mr. Stone's hype.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Not content with that major error, the Journal editorialillustrated a lack of understanding of the overwhelmingevidence in the Warren Commission Report proving that LeeHarvey Oswald was the lone gunman who killed PresidentKennedy and who 45 minutes later killed Dallas Police OfficerJ.D. Tippit. It asserts: &quot;Anyone who wants to know what rocksthe Warren Commission left unturned, though, should not turnto Mr. Garrison. Instead, read Edward J. Epstein, author of`Inquest,' a critique of the Commission.&quot; Alas, Mr. Epsteinhimself is a conspiracy sensationalist whose central thesis,like &quot;JFK,&quot; depends upon a misrepresentation of the record.   In &quot;Inquest,&quot; Mr. Epstein writes that it is &quot;extremelydoubtful that the throat wound {of President Kennedy} wascaused by the first bullet to strike the President&quot; becauseSecret Service Agent Roy Kellerman, &quot;who was in the frontseat of the President's limousine, testified that hedistinctly heard the President say, `My God, I am hit,' afterthe first shot. Since the projectile that caused the throatwound also punctured the windpipe, it is medically highlyimprobable that the President could speak after he receivedthe throat wound.&quot;   Although Mr. Epstein correctly quotes the testimony ofKellerman, he does not quote the heart of the testimony ofthe four other people in the presidential limousine: SecretService agent William Greer, Gov. John Connally, NellieConnally and Jacqueline Kennedy. Mr. Greer testified: &quot;Inever heard him say anything.&quot; Nellie Connally testified thatPresident Kennedy &quot;made no utterance, no cry.&quot; Gov. Connallytestified, &quot;He never uttered a sound at all.&quot; JacquelineKennedy said, &quot;I was looking this way, to the left, and Iheard these terrible noises. And my husband never made anysound.&quot;   As for the Journal's allegation that the Warren Commission&quot;was less intent on truth than in unifying the nation,&quot; thatis hogwash. I was one of the people selected by Earl Warrento serve as counsel to his commission. One of the most vividmemories of my professional career is our first meeting, whenhe uttered five words I will never forget: &quot;Truth is our onlygoal.&quot;   We took him at his word. That is one of the reasons why,after being thwarted inside the Warren Commission by thechief justice himself, who did not want to use lie detectortests, I went around the commission and contacted Jack Ruby'srabbi, Hillel Silverman. I was able to persuade him topersuade Jack Ruby to ask for a lie detector test. The testwas given and, although such tests are not 100% reliable, itdid confirm Ruby's testimony that he was not part of anyconspiracy.   Nowhere in &quot;JFK&quot; does the audience hear about Ruby'srequest, the results of that test, or Rabbi Silverman'stestimony that he is convinced, based on his intimateconversations with Jack Ruby in jail, that Ruby wasconspiratorially innocent.   Also ignored in &quot;JFK&quot; is the fact Robert Kennedy hadsomeone from the Justice Department, Howard Willens, serveboth as a counsel to the Warren Commission and as liaisonwith Justice.   Robert Kennedy wanted to know who killed his brother.Edward Epstein asserts there was more than one gunman and theStone film asserts &quot;triangulation&quot; -- that is, two othergunmen firing, in addition to Oswald (although Mr. Stonewould have us believe that Oswald did not fire a rifle orpistol at anyone -- not even Tippit). Surely, Robert Kennedywould have wanted every gunman brought to justice. But thatcommon-sense conclusion is never raised in &quot;JFK&quot; or&quot;Inquest.&quot;   Similarly, &quot;JFK&quot; and Mr. Epstein ignore the fact therewere six witnesses who identified Oswald as the gunman theysaw at the Tippit murder scene or running away from it withgun in hand. He was caught with the murder weapon, which hepulled out when police approached him in the Texas movietheater.   The Tippit murder is the Rosetta Stone to the solution ofthe assassination. &quot;JFK&quot; ignores virtually all the salientfacts of this murder that conclusively show Oswald's guilt.Mr. Epstein's &quot;Inquest&quot; also ignores the massive weight ofthe evidence that shows Oswald killed Tippit.   If the Journal had been true to its lofty standards, itwould have gone to the bedrock of the Warren CommissionReport and exposed some of the more than 100 major lies andcoverups in &quot;JFK.&quot; Mr. Stone repeatedly uses the same kind ofselectivity as Mr. Epstein in misrepresenting the overallrecord, and these misrepresentations are compounded bypromotional appearances of &quot;JFK&quot; actors on TV.   If more examples are needed to show the depth of theWarren Commission Report, one can turn to the well-knownpicture of Oswald holding a pistol and a rifle. Oswaldclaimed he never owned a rifle, and &quot;JFK&quot; joins with Oswaldin charging that the picture was a fabrication -- Oswald'shead placed on someone else's body holding a rifle and a gun.   In fact, there is absolute proof that the picture isgenuine because Oswald's camera was found. There are minutedifferences in the manufacturing process of every camera. Ifone has a negative, it can be scientifically determined with100% accuracy -- just as in the case of a fingerprint --whether that negative came from that camera, to the exclusionof all other cameras in the world. That photograph, indeed,came from Oswald's camera. Why does &quot;JFK&quot; ignore thatevidence?   I believe the remaining small portion of unreleased WarrenCommission files and everything in the CIA files about theassassination should be released to the public. In 1975 Ifiled Freedom of Information Act requests to that effect.   In fact, though, all the documents needed to analyze thiscase are already available. I look forward to the time whennewspapers such as The Wall Street Journal take the time toexamine fairly the Warren Commission Report in depth. Indeed,not only was truth our only goal, but we found that truth:Lee Harvey Oswald was the lone gunman who killed PresidentKennedy and Officer J.D. Tippit on that tragic Fridayafternoon in Dallas, Nov. 22, 1963.   ---   Mr. Belin served as counsel to the Warren Commission andexecutive director of the Rockefeller Commissioninvestigating the CIA. He is the author of &quot;Final Disclosure:The Full Truth About the Assassination of President Kennedy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
