Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Li Jinhua also singled outWashington as being ``too deeply involved'' in the pro-democracymovement here last spring that was suppressed by Chinese troops.   If sanctions against China are adopted, ``it will cast a newshadow over Chinese-U.S. relations and ... will hurt the feelingsof the Chinese people,'' she told a weekly news conference.   Negotiators from the U.S. Senate and House of Representativesagreed on Tuesday to stiffen proposed sanctions against China toprotest the June crackdown.   The measure asks two years of trade sanctions, includingsuspension of trade assistance; a halt to certain insurance forfirms doing business in China, and a freeze on exports ofsatellites, semimilitary items such as helicopters, and certainnuclear material and components.   The bill condemns the ``unprovoked, brutal and indiscriminateassault'' on the protesters, which it said left at least 700 dead.   China has said about 300 people died.   ``At present, Chinese-U.S. relations are in a period of greatdifficulties,'' Ms. Li said. ``China should not be held responsiblefor the difficulties. The reason for these difficulties is that theU.S. has gotten itself too deeply involved in the turmoil andrebellion that happened not too long ago in Beijing.''   China insists the protests were whipped up by``counterrevolutionaries'' seeking to overthrow the communistregime, and says foreign forces supported the uprising.   Senior leader Deng Xiaoping also told visiting former PresidentRichard Nixon last week that the United States was ``too deeplyinvolved'' in the demonstrations, and China was ``the real victim''of the events at the time.   The U.S. government rejects the charges. A State Departmentspokesman said this month that the protests ``were clearly theresult of domestic developments in China.''</TEXT></DOC>
