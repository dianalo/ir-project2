(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Texaco Inc. said Thursday it signed adefinitive agreement with Saudi Arabian Oil Co. on their previouslyannounced venture to jointly refine and market petroleum in theUnited States.   Texaco will receive $812 million for a 50 percent interest in itsrefining assets and marketing system in 23 East and Gulf Coaststates. The oil company said it expects to enjoy an additional $1billion in cash benefits and savings resulting from the jointventure.   The agreement, which was originally outlined in June, providesSaudi Arabia, the world's biggest oil exporter, with a secure outletfor its products while virtually guaranteeing Texaco a steady streamof crude at market prices.   The joint venture will be known as Star Enterprises and will beheadquartered in Houston.   The company will operate three major Texaco refineries _ inDelaware City, Del.; Convent, La.; and Port Arthur, Texas. It alsowill operate about 1,450 owned and leased service stations anddistribute products to more than 10,000 stations. It will employ5,000 people and is expected to be in operation by Dec. 31.   The Saudis will provide 75 percent of the Star Enterprises'initial oil inventory. The joint venture will retain the right tobuy up to 600,000 barrels of crude from the Saudis each day atmarket prices.   At the signing of the agreement in London, Texaco President JamesKinnear called the joint venture ``one of several major steps wehave taken to restructure Texaco and to enhance shareholder value.''   Earlier this year Texaco emerged from protection from itscreditors under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. It has beenselling off $5 billion in assets to offest the disastrous effects ofprolonged litigation with Pennzoil Co., which resulted in thebankruptcy court reorganization and a $3 billion payment to Pennzoil.   The oil giant also survived a bitter power struggle with itslargest shareholder, financier Carl Icahn, who attempted to acquirethe company for about $14 billion.   Observers have taken issue with the Saudi venture on the groundsthat it raises questions about increased foreign leverage over theU.S. oil industry, which has become increasingly reliant on imports.   The venture is believed to be the biggest of its kind between aforeign supplier and a domestic oil company in the ``downstream''end of the business _ the process for changing crude into gasolineand other products.   The Saudi government has hinted that Saudi Arabia is interestedin forming more marketing joint ventures. Oil industry sources saidthe kingdom was interested in linking up with European companies.</TEXT></DOC>
