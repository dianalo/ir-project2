Mr. Balog, 59 years old, said he is seeking &quot;a change in life style,&quot; with a chance to do &quot;more front-line investment stuff (and) less management.&quot;    At Drexel, Mr. Balog was in charge of the firm's branch system of 1,300 brokers in 37 offices, its money management operation with $7 billion of assets, and advertising, public relations and legislative affairs.    Frederick Joseph, Drexel's chief executive officer, said that the securities firm won't fill Mr. Balog's job, but will divide his responsibilities among others.    Mr. Balog said he will join Lambert Brussels Capital Corp., the holding company for Groupe Bruxelles Lambert's U.S. interests. The unit has stakes in various financial services and manufacturing concerns, which Mr. Balog said include Drexel and &quot;several hundred million&quot; dollars of other investments.    Mr. Balog, a director of Brussels Capital, said he will have &quot;no special involvement&quot; in supervising the unit's Drexel interests. He said he will also pursue other outside interests, which he didn't identify.    Mr. Balog, son of a Pennsylvania immigrant coal miner, worked as a chemist and a budget official at Merck andamp; Co. before coming to Wall Street in 1961 as a securities analyst and portfolio manager. In 1969, he joined the research firm of William D. Witter Inc. and served as its chairman. He joined Drexel in 1976 when Lambert Brussels Witter Group was merged into Drexel. </TEXT></DOC>
