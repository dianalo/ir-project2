The strike could end as early as tomorrow, when negotiators will present the package to about 300 striking writers, editors and other CBS News employees for a vote, a union spokesman said.    In a statement, the union said that, among other things, the proposed three-year contract would retain an employee's right to go to arbitration if dismissed, which the company had sought to eliminate. It also would provide salary increases of 3% annually. The contract is retroactive to March 2. The union also said it negotiated &quot;amnesty&quot; for employees who refused to cross picket lines and report to work. The most visible CBS News employee who honored the picket line was commentator Andy Rooney.    But a CBS spokesman said the company -- which had sought more freedom in hiring temporary employees and use of managers and on-air reporters to write stories, among other items -- &quot;achieved its objectives&quot; in the negotiations.    The union said separate contract talks with Capital Cities/ABC Inc. are continuing. About 225 union members are on strike at that network's news division. </TEXT></DOC>
