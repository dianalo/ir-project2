Solzhenitsyn in which hecalls Vladimir Lenin ``evil'' _ a shocking description for thosewho consider the Soviet founder a virtual god.   Publication of the article in this week's mass-circulation ZaRubezhom is remarkable both in its criticism of Lenin and as aninterview with Solzhenitsyn, whose writings were banned in theSoviet Union from 1962 until March this year.   In the past four months Soviet journals have published twoSolzhenitsyn essays. Novy Mir, the nation's leading literarymagazine, is preparing to publish excerpts of ``The GulagArchipelago,'' Solzhenitsyn's account of Soviet political prisoncamps.   In the Time interview, Solzhenitsyn said Lenin was ``uncommonlyevil.'' When asked what he meant by evil, Solzhenitsyn replied,``The absence of any mercy, the absence of any humanity in hisapproach to the people, the masses, to anyone who did not followhim precisely.''   Za Rubezhom carried a comment on that reply.   An adjacent article, signed by historian A.M. Sovokin, saidSolzhenitsyn must have ``defective sight'' to ascribe suchcharacteristics to Lenin. Solzhenitsyn writes of Lenin and theBolshevik Revolution ``in a spirit of prejudice and intolerance,''Sovokin said.   Under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's policy of glasnost oropenness, former Soviet leaders Josef Stalin and Leonid Brezhnevhave been blamed for many of the country's problems. But Lenin _whose statue holds a prominent place in every Soviet city _ wasabove criticism until June.   At that time, a magazine published the late Vasily Grossman'sshort novel, ``Forever Flowing,'' in which he accuseds Lenin ofcontempt for freedom and cruelty to his opponents.   The Za Rubezhom article also told Soviets that Solzhenitsynstill faces criminal charges for treason in his homeland.   In the Time interview Solzhenitsyn described the BolshevikRevolution as a ``coup d'etat'' and said the Bolsheviks themselvescalled it the ``October coup'' through the 1920s.   The Nobel Literature prize winner, who was exiled in 1974, livesin Cavendish, Vt. He said in the interview that he will not returnto his homeland until his Soviet history, ``The Red Wheel,'' ispublished and available in every bookstore in the Soviet Union.   However, sources in the Soviet Writers' Union, which reinstatedhim in July, said they expect Solzhenitsyn to visit his homeland,possibly as soon as autumn.   The Soviet government has moved toward rehabilitatingSolzhenitsyn, who is seen by some countrymen as a prophet of freespeech and by others as an embodiment of of Russian nationalism.The Writers' Union, which publishes Novy Mir, has urged thegovernment to reinstate his citizenship.</TEXT></DOC>
