But the story was wrong. Ben Franklin did propose on June 28, 1787, that the delegates in Philadelphia begin the day with a prayer. The convention adjourned for the day without a vote, however, and since there was little support for an opening prayer, the issue wasn't raised again.    In this, the Constitution's Bicentennial year, one of the most emotional questions is what is meant by the First Amendment's guarantee that &quot;Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof. . . .&quot; As with President Reagan's story, invoking constitutional history provides few clear answers.    Does the First Amendment prohibit government preference for one religion over another, but permit aid to parochial education, silent prayer in public schools and the erection of religious symbols on public property? This is the view of Reagan administration officials and of Chief Justice William Rehnquist.    Or does the First Amendment require what Thomas Jefferson described in 1802 as a &quot;wall of separation&quot; between church and state? This view has guided a majority of the Supreme Court for the last 40 years, including conservatives like the late Justices Robert Jackson and Felix Frankfurter.    When the battle moves to present-day specifics, the fight is over such issues as whether student religious groups or clubs should have the same access to facilities as other clubs at public schools; whether parochial schools or their students may be reimbursed for transportation or provided with textbooks or other materials by the government; and whether public school systems can run remedial programs in parochial schools.    But by far the most emotional issue is prayer in the schools. The Supreme Court created a furor that hasn't died down with decisions in 1962 and 1963 barring official prayer and Bible reading; in 1985, the court reaffirmed the position, rejecting a state law that the court said promoted prayer in the public schools. Conservatives, from Ronald Reagan to the religious right, have for a number of years said one of their top priorities is a constitutional amendment permitting school prayer, but they have made little headway.    The Reagan administration urges a return to interpreting the Constitution according to the &quot;original intent&quot; of the framers -- in this case, members of the first Congress, which proposed the Bill of Rights in 1789. The intent, Attorney General Edwin Meese said in a 1985 speech, was only to prohibit Congress &quot;from establishing a national church&quot; or from favoring &quot;a particular faith or sect as politically above the rest.&quot; To argue &quot;that the amendment demands a strict neutrality between religion and irreligion would have struck the founding generation as bizarre,&quot; Mr. Meese added.    To illustrate that point of view, retired Chief Justice Warren Burger and others note that James Madison, who helped draft the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, was part of a committee in 1789 that approved federally paid chaplains for Congress.    But Leonard Levy, a respected historian at Claremont Graduate School in California, said in a recent public television interview that advocates of original intent &quot;know very little about history.&quot; In his writings, Mr. Levy cites James Madison's comment in an 1822 letter that the payment of congressional chaplains &quot;was not with my approbation.&quot;    Mr. Levy also writes that the &quot;establishment&quot; barred by the First Amendment was &quot;any support, especially financial support, of religion by government, whether the support be to religion in general, to all churches, some churches, or one church.&quot;    When the First Amendment was drafted in 1789, churches were supported by taxes in many states, Mr. Levy writes. When it was ratified in 1791, the Bill of Rights didn't end that support, because it was intended only as a limitation on the power of the federal government. Indeed, a number of states continued to recognize official churches into the early 1800s.    Most of the dozens of Supreme Court rulings preserving church-state separation in the last 40 years -- the rulings criticized by political conservatives and religious right groups today -- involve state and local laws and programs.    It wasn't until the 1940s that the Supreme Court said that the 14th Amendment, ratified in 1868, held that the states, too, had to accept religious freedom by separating church and state. The 14th Amendment said that no state may &quot;deprive any person of life, liberty or property, without due process of law.&quot;    The Supreme Court, in 1940 with the free-exercise-of-religion clause and in 1947 with the establishment-of-religion provision, said the &quot;liberty&quot; protected from state interference by the 14th Amendment includes freedoms that the First Amendment originally insulated only against congressional action.    Many scholars, including Mr. Levy, concede there is little evidence that the 14th Amendment was specifically intended to curb state laws on religion. But Mr. Levy accepts the high court's interpretation as a &quot;possibility.&quot;    Jesse Choper, law school dean at the University of California at Berkeley, says to argue that the religion clauses don't apply to state laws &quot;would effect a revolution in church-state relations.&quot; Indeed, no current or recent Supreme Court member has argued for unleashing the states. But in his 1985 speech, Mr. Meese said that the incorporation of the First Amendment into the 14th to limit state power rests on an &quot;intellectually shaky foundation.&quot;    When not sparring over history, much of the current controversy involves a three-part test in religion cases that the Supreme Court has used since 1971. The court has held that a law that aids or affects religion is valid only if it has a secular purpose, if it neither advances nor inhibits religion and if it avoids excessive government entanglement in church affairs.    Critics of this approach say the court hasn't applied the test in any consistent, predictable fashion. The court has upheld some parochial-aid programs but not others, for example. Solicitor General Charles Fried recently said the high court's approach &quot;makes no sense whatsoever.&quot;    In cases involving religious preferences of workers, the court sometimes orders states to defer to &quot;free exercise&quot; of religion -- contradicting the idea of the wall of separation. &quot;The doctrine of strict separation is hard to apply outside the context of schools,&quot; says John Sexton, a professor at New York University Law School.    But even with the criticism, many groups cling to separation. &quot;Separation is the only way to protect the equal relationship of citizens to goverment, no matter what their religion,&quot; says Ruti Teitel of the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith. </TEXT></DOC>
