The attack Thursday, the second on tourists in Kenya this month,took place as 19 tourists were riding in three vans along the40-mile road between the Amboseli and Tsavo national parks, thesource said.   A woman was killed instantly when shot through the head by twomen with AK-47 assault rifles, and a man was shot in the chest,according to the report.   In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Frances Jones saidMarie Esther Ferraro, age unknown, of New Haven, Conn., was shotand killed and another American was slightly wounded. She did notgive the wounded person's name.   The gunmen apparently ambushed the tourists along a bad stretchof road that forced them to slow down, said the source, who spokeon condition of anonymity.   The trip was organized by the Connecticut Audubon Society andhad 19 participants _ 18 from Connecticut and one from Georgia,said Lauren Brown, a society spokeswoman in Fairfield, Conn. Shewould not identify the victims but said both were from Connecticut.   The two-week tour began July 17, she said.   Police Commissioner Philip Kilonzo and Richard Leakey, directorof wildlife, went to the scene to investigate.   It was the latest in a series of attacks on tourists that beganin September when a Dutch tourist was shot in the chest in MeruNational Park.   Also in September, the remains of a British woman were found insprawling Masai Mara Game Reserve in southwestern Kenya. An inquestbegins Aug. 7 into her death, which her father says was murder.Police have said she could have fallen prey to wild animals.   In the first week of July, two French tourists were shot todeath in Meru National Park, east of Mount Kenya, by poachers.Leakey had called it an isolated incident, and said he did notthink the poachers were ``looking for tourists to shoot.''   In April, three West German tourists were wounded by gunmen whoambushed their vehicles in about the same spot between Tsavo andAmboseli.   Two Americans remain hospitalized after being beaten up lastweek while on a horseback riding safari in Masai Mara. The U.S.Embassy refused to release any details about the two.   Maintaining the security of Kenya's parks and tourist locationsis vital to the East Africa nation, which says it has had nearly 3million tourists since 1984. Tourism last year brought in nearly$350 million and has become Kenya's top foreign exchange earner.   After the French couple was killed, the government said itstepped up security to make sure the national parks and gamereserves were ``peaceful and comfortable havens'' for tourists andto ensure the survival of wildlife.   Kenya has suffered increased poaching activity in which armedbandits seeking valuable ivory tusks have been stalking and killingelephants, primarily in Tsavo National Park.   Since Leakey became director of wildlife in March, Kenya hasstepped up its anti-poaching efforts. Since January, game rangershave killed more than 20 poachers.</TEXT></DOC>
