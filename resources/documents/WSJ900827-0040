Now they are feeling stifled byMoscow's dictates.   Many of the Soviet Union's 15 republics feel the same wayand the initiative for economic reform is shifting from thecentral government to regional areas. From the huge RussianFederation to tiny autonomous regions, districts are sayingthey can move faster alone.   Leningrad's leaders hope to take advantage of the factthat their city was one of five areas declared by the Russianparliament as &quot;joint enterprise zones.&quot; But as with many suchdeclarations, nobody knows exactly what this means, or how afree economic zone operates.   The cacophony of ideas takes form in the grand marblebuilding that houses the Leningrad Parliament. In a tiny,jammed office, politicians hold a running discussion whilephones jangle and visitors pop in with their own proposals.   One commission is holding a contest for the best idea onhow to transfer to a market economy. People send in theirideas, but they probably won't see light because the contestruns beyond the deadline for Leningrad's proposal to besubmitted to the Russian government.   Many of the goals may prove to be grandiose since no onehas convincingly described how to achieve them: Internationaleconomic ties should be liberalized so that foreign companiesreceive tax breaks and no longer have to register with theFinance Ministry; a separate banking system should beestablished; and huge industrial monopolies should be brokenup into thousands of smaller companies.   &quot;This disintegration seems to be easily achievable,&quot; PyotrFilipov says almost blithely.   A representative on the Leningrad City Council and theRussian Federation parliament, Mr. Filipov describes anotherproject already under way: persuading foreign investors tobuy some of Leningrad's graceful but decrepit buildings,refurbish them and then lease them for 25 to 50 years.   Mayor Anatoli Sobchak is visiting the U.S. with an evenmore straightforward appeal. One of his missions is tocollect donations that will serve as the core of a fund toreconstruct his city. Nevsky Prospect, the center of fashionand elegance in Czarist Russia, could become the center oftourism and hard currency, he figures. Once a grand avenue ofdelicately ornamented architecture, today it is full ofpotholes and the buildings are shabby.   Some foreign and Soviet businessmen have started pushingLeningrad toward its goal. Hard currency, increasingly thefavored means of transaction in Moscow, is even betterestablished in Leningrad. Some Leningrad economists are eventoying with the idea of making the dollar the city's newcurrency.   Taxis accepting only dollars line the airport curb.Hamburger stands sell Cokes for hard currency but only Sovietsoda for rubles. Refreshment stands sell vanilla ice creamfor 30 kopeks on the street while a nearby German-Sovietjoint venture sells pricey Italian parfaits for hardcurrency.   Leningrad may be the first to open a Soviet stockexchange. New York Stock Exchange officials visited recentlyto discuss the idea with Mr. Sobchak's team. &quot;They'llprobably be the first,&quot; says a Western diplomat. &quot;Leningradjust has a more maverick personality than Moscow.&quot;   A group of computer experts and economists are leading thethrust. Sergei Petrov heads a team whose current pet projectis creating an automated stock exchange. Mr. Petrov has tiesto the Midwest Stock Exchange, which may offer advice on howto establish an automated exchange.   &quot;At first we wondered whether there would be an exchangeat all,&quot; says Mr. Petrov. &quot;Then we applied the main rule ofmarketing: Create your own market.&quot;   This kind of vigor and enthusiasm also expresses itself ina public confidence in the government that has long sincevanished in Moscow and other parts of the country.Leningraders are unusually forgiving of their localgovernment. They often excuse the fact that few concreteimprovements have been made, saying that the council was onlyelected a few months ago and it needs time to work.   Leningrad's first free elections in March led to a citycouncil in which two-thirds of the deputies are new, and mostally themselves with democratic movements. Even before BorisYeltsin, the popular leader of the enormous RussianFederation, announced he was going to quit the CommunistParty, a poll in Leningrad showed that 49% of the city'sCommunists had already left the party or were planning to assoon as possible.   Mr. Kesselman argues that even more important than theenlightened leadership of Mr. Sobchak and his city council isthe change in the way Leningraders are thinking about life.&quot;Now the old structures don't work and new ones are justbeing formed,&quot; he says. &quot;In such a situation, the changeswhich are going to take place are very dependent on thereadiness of the population for change.&quot;   And for all the politicians' bright ideas, few have begunto tackle exactly how they should be achieved. Take thebreak-up of monopolies: cities, regions and the centralgovernment have yet to agree on who actually owns a givenfactory, a hot argument that must be resolved before thefirst steps to privatization can take place.   &quot;Of course we have contradictions with the centralgovernment,&quot; says Mr. Filipov. &quot;We live in a very unbalancedtime in which republics don't ask for rights, they simplytake them themselves.&quot;   But such contradictions don't worry him. &quot;Suppose we makethe decision to introduce free prices in our zone. Wouldanyone be able to stop us? I don't think so.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
