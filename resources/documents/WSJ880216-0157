Mr. Holmes a Court said the companies -- Bell Group Ltd., Bell Resources Ltd., and J.N. Taylor Holdings -- are considering a restructuring &quot;to reflect new conditions and objectives.&quot; He said that various alternatives were being studied but that concrete proposal hadn't been formulated.    Some analysts have predicted a merger of Bell Group and Bell Resources, and perhaps of J.N. Taylor as well.    Mr. Holmes a Court's finances have been uncertain since the October crash, and his companies have been shedding assets to raise money for debt payments. The sales have raised more than four billion dollars ($2.86 billion) but have also resulted in losses of more than half a billion dollars. Last month, Broken Hill Proprietary Co., Australia's biggest company, said it would pay Mr. Holmes a Court 2.1 billion dollars to cut his stake in BHP by two-thirds. And earlier this month, Bell Group canceled a 475-million-dollar purchase of assets from John Fairfax Ltd. by mutual consent of the two companies.    Bell Group yesterday reported a loss of 298.5 million dollars for the first half ended Dec. 31, in contrast to a year-earlier profit of 32.2 million dollars. Including results of associated companies, the loss widened to 498.3 million dollars, compared with a year-earlier profit of 84.4 million dollars.    Write-downs by Bell Group of 318 million dollars, plus its share of write-downs by associated companies, totaled 501 million dollars. But before abnormal items, interest and tax, Bell Group's operating profit rose 26%, to 152.6 million dollars.    Bell Resources' loss for all of 1987 was 270.4 million dollars, compared with a year-earlier profit of 156 million dollars. The resources-investment arm of the Holmes a Court companies, wrote down 407 million dollars from the value of its listed investments and also incurred a loss of 154 million dollars from selling investments. Earnings before abnormal items, interest and tax rose 43%, to 200.1 million dollars.    Bell Resources didn't take into its latest accounts any earnings from BHP, in which it has a 29% stake, because it is selling most of that investment. Year-earlier figures were adjusted to make them comparable.    J.N. Taylor reported an overall loss of 30.8 million dollars for the first half ended Dec. 31, compared with a year-earlier profit of 14 million dollars. The result is after an abnormal loss of 58.9 million dollars on the sale of investments and 12.4 million dollars written down from the value of investments.    Mr. Holmes a Court emphasized yesterday that the write-downs of his companies represent unrealized non-cash losses, and don't necessarily reflect permanent drops in the value of the investments. He also said certain other assets could be valued up from their book costs to ameliorate the impact of the write-downs on the balance-sheet. </TEXT></DOC>
