A U.S. Air Force cargo plane was bound for the southern city ofPunta Arenas, where the equipment will be transferred to a U.S.research vessel, the Polar Duke, the U.S. Embassy in Santiago said.   Officials stressed they still were trying to assess the magnitudeof the spill, which was caused by a sunken Argentine supply ship,but said it represented the first major environmental threat to theAntarctic.   The National Science Foundation in Washington said the crippledArgentine ship carried 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel and that an``incurable disaster'' would result if all the fuel leaked into theunspoiled waters in the region.   In Buenos Aires, the Argentine navy played down the spill andsaid it did not pose a serious ecological threat.   But U.S. officials on Wednesday launched a massive effort to stemthe spill, which was four miles in diameter and moving to thesouthwest, said Jack Talmadge, a spokesman for the National ScienceFoundation.   The spill occurred after the Bahia Paraiso (Paradise Bay), anArgentine navy vessel, ran aground on Saturday in the BismarckStrait, about 600 miles south of the southern tip of South Americaand 1{ miles from the U.S. Palmer Research Station in Antarctica.   All passengers and crew were rescued, but the vessel floated freein heavy seas and then capsized Tuesday night, spilling barrels ofoil and several hundred propane gas containers into the water,Talmadge said.   ``It has leaked oil,'' he said. ``We're not sure whether the oilleak is continuing. The water surrounding the ship is covered with acouple of centimeters (about an inch) of oil. There is a sheen ofoil in a much wider area around the ship, including evidence of oilon the coastline of the several islands there.''   A private yacht 10-15 miles away reported earlier that it hadseen oil patches on the water, he said. Oil also was spotted at theresearch station.   ``Wildlife has already begun to be affected,'' including krill,the small crustaceans that form the basis of the Antarctic foodchain, Talmadge said.   ``Birds which have eaten the krill are showing behaviordifferences,'' he said. ``One dead penguin had been found as of afew hours ago.''   A National Science Foundation statement said about 12,000 pairsof penguins and other sea birds nested in the area last year.   ``In a few weeks, hatchling penguins will leave their nests andenter the now-fouled Antarctic waters, as will their parents,'' saidthe statement.   A team of 15 experts and 52 tons of equipment on a giant U.S. AirForce C-5B cargo plane left Norfolk, Va., on Wednesday. It was toarrive here on Thursday and then go by ship across the Drake Passageto the accident site along the Antarctic Peninsula by Monday,Talmadge said.   The National Science Foundation manages the U.S. AntarcticProgram, which includes Palmer Station, a scientific outpost.   Talmadge said scientists from the station have been going out inboats to assess the damage and try to catch the oil barrels andpropane containers floating in the water.   ``We're trying to get those, but that's a pretty massiveproject,'' he said. ``We're using all the lifeboats from the shipand any other boats we can get hold of in the area.''   The National Science Foundation is organizing the clean-upmission, with assistance from the U.S. Air Force, Navy and theNational Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration.   In Buenos Aires, an Argentine navy spokesman said: ``There couldbe a small stain'' from the release of oil in the engine room of theship. ``Anything else, no,'' He said.   The ship carried tourists as well as fuel for several polarstations. All 300 ship occupants were taken to the Palmer stationafter the vessel ran aground.   Another National Science Foundation spokesman in Washington, JackRenerie, said in a telephone interview that the cargo plane wascarrying a 35-foot ``skimming boat'' for scooping up spilled oil andpumping it into floating tanks; a small tugboat; inflatable booms tocontain the spill, and a special truck for loading and unloading theequipment.   He said it was accompanied by a crew from two private U.S.clean-up companies, Marine Polution Control and Global Associates.</TEXT></DOC>
