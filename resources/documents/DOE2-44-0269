The corrosion behavior of these metals was evaluatedby examining the structure, composition and growth rate of the protectivescale that forms on these metals. Molybdenum exhibited the greatest resistanceto corrosion, and lithium polysulfides were observed to be more aggressivethan either sulfur or sodium polysulfides.</TEXT></DOC>
