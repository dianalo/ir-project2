An act of Congress more than 40 years ago allowed constructionof the Bull Lake Dam and Reservoir so land in the arid Wind RiverValley could be commercially farmed.   But in doing so, the government created a seeminglyirreconcilable conflict between the treaty rights of the Indiansand the needs of area residents to water their crops, witnessessaid.   Water levels sometimes dropped so low fish could not spawn, andwithout the fish the Indians were deprived not only of food buttheir ability to practice some parts of their religion, thecommittee was told.   Starr Weed, religious leader for the Shoshones, said his tribeconsiders the Bull Lake sacred and remembers when buffalo used tolive in the area.   Since the dam was built the fish aren't always available for animportant tribal ceremony known as the Sun Dance in which fish areeaten before three days of fasting and dancing, he said.   ``When the water goes down it hurts our feelings,'' the elderlyIndian told the committee.   The situation is typical of other parts of the country wherewater is in short supply and Indians have a right to it, said KenBallen, chief counsel to the special panel of the Senate SelectCommittee on Indian Affairs which is investigating all agenciesthat have responsibilities to American Indians.   David Allison, superintendent of the Wind River Agency of theBureau of Indian Affairs, said he doesn't think the federalgovernment is meeting its trust responsibilities to the Shoshonesand Arapahoes. And he said he found it frustrating to be anofficial with that responsibility.   ``The federal agencies at Wind River are not properlycoordinating their activities,'' he said.   The Bureau of Reclamation is charged with making sure the landis irrigated, while the BIA must protect Indian rights.   There is ``inherent conflict,'' said Roger Patterson, regionaldirector of the reclamation bureau.   ``There's not enough water to satisfy all the purposes,'' hesaid.   Patterson said farmers in the area grow grain and sugar beetswith a production value of about $30 million a year on about 70,000acres of irrigated land.   Allison, of the BIA, said the 8,000 or so Indians in the areaare not only losing fish for their own use, but about $500,000 intrade from the sportsmen who used to fish there.</TEXT></DOC>
