Gary Hart appeared poised to abandontheir presidential hopes.   Hart, whose reconstituted presidential campaign has attractedfew votes, has scheduled a news conference in Denver on Friday, andone report said he has told his staff he'll call it quits.   Sen. Bob Dole, campaigning in Chicago, said Kemp had telephonedhim to say he would drop out of the race Thursday, withoutendorsing another Republican. Kemp has scheduled a morning newsconference in Washington on Thursday.   ``He (Kemp) wanted me to know he was going to get outtomorrow...He's not going to endorse anybody...He's going to stayneutral,'' Dole told reporters.   Democrat Hart, who re-entered the race in December saying ``Letthe people decide'' but who got less than 5 percent of the vote inall primary states, canceled a Wednesday night speech in Chicago.   Hart watched the returns Tuesday night with his family in hishome in suburban Denver and made no public comment on the outcome.The next day he put travel plans on hold, and Denver TV stationKUSA said he told his staff he would be quitting.   Kemp, a former pro football quarterback, who had portrayedhimself as a consensus conservative who could carry on the Reagan``revolution,'' was not expected to continue his cash-shortcandidacy any further.   Kemp, who met with advisers on Wednesday, had been reportedready to pull out of the race this week anyway, even beforeTuesday's results were known.   But Robertson, who did only slightly better than Kemp in the GOPprimaries, struck a defiant note, vowing to carry his challenge allthe way to the Republican convention this summer in New Orleans.   ``It isn't over yet,'' Robertson said at a news conference inAtlanta. ``Still half of the delegates are to be selected.''   Although the former television evangelist earlier had looked tothe South as his base of support, he dismissed the importance ofTuesday's primaries, held mostly in Southern and border states.   ``I was running against the ghost of Ronald Reagan,'' Robertsonsaid of the 16-state sweep by Vice President George Bush.   ``I'm in it for the long haul, for this time, for 1990, thecongressional races, and who knows what will happen in 1992,'' saidRobertson.   Robertson did chalk up one victory on Tuesday, winning theWashington state caucuses. But in other states, he was faroutdistanced by both front-runner Bush and Sen. Bob Dole.   Democratic Sen. Paul Simon, who sat out the Super Tuesdayprimaries but did poorly in states where his name appeared on theballot, called next week's primary in his home state of Illinoisthe ``Super Tuesday of the industrial states.''   ``If I don't do well here, I'll have to reassess my campaign _but I'll do well,'' Simon said. ``We'll win the beauty contest andthe delegates. We'll win more delegates than anybody else.''   Simon said he was not going to buy television ads in his homestate.   ``I offer Illinois 30 years of service rather than a 30-secondcommercial,'' Simon said at a morning news conference in Chicago.   Meanwhile, Democrat Rep. Richard Gephardt and Dole sought toshrug off their big losses and pressed on with their campaigns.   ``It's up to Illinois now to turn it around,'' Dole, the SenateRepublican leader, told voters in a Chicago suburb after he wasshut out in all 17 Tuesday GOP primaries and caucuses.   And Gephardt, who like Dole picked up only a handful ofdelegates and won only in his home state of Missouri, campaignedWednesday in South Carolina, where Democratic caucuses are to beheld on Saturday.   His campaign also was to focus on the March 26 voting inMichigan, after all but conceding Illinois to the two home statecandidates, Simon and Jesse Jackson, whose home is in Chicago.</TEXT></DOC>
