These issues are dealt with in Part I of this book. Analysisshould also be concerned with the equity impacts of alternative energystrategies. The comparison of pulp versus fuelwood options in the GhanaSubri Forest case in Part II also have important income distributionimplications because of differences in the labor intensity of these options.Part III of this book has four chapters devoted to anthropological, political,social, and environmental education perspectives on the problems of implementingrenewable energy projects. The projects involve agroforestry in the Philippines,deforestation in Costa Rica, and soil conservation and sustainable fuelwoodproduction in the Dominican Republic and Barbados. The delineation ofproperty rights, political competition and patronage, degree of centralization,and role of local farmer organizations are some of the issues discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
