EmshwillerStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 08/24/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> LATAMBOND MARKET NEWS (BON)SECURITIES INDUSTRY (SCR) </IN><DATELINE> BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Michael Milken, who transformed junk bonds once, plans to do it again.    In the past decade, the 41-year-old Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. official has taken junk bonds from a sleepy little corner of the market and turned them into one of the hottest and most controversial of financial instruments. Drexel's junk-bond unit here, which Mr. Milken heads, has sold tens of billions of dollars of such securities, which are considered below investment grade by the major bond-rating agencies.    But in a recent interview, Mr. Milken acknowledged that the bonds, which critics have called everything from &quot;toxic waste&quot; to &quot;securities swill,&quot; do have an image problem for some people.    &quot;We haven't done a very good job explaining the substance of high-yield bonds (Drexel's preferred term for such securities)&quot; said Mr. Milken. So, he added, &quot;Maybe form is the problem.&quot; His idea is to create a mechanism, probably sometime this year, that would allow junk bonds to, in effect, be replaced with securities having an investment-grade rating.    Another project, he said, is a plan to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to invest in Latin America.    As previously reported, Mr. Milken and Drexel have been identified as being under investigation in a wide-ranging federal probe of insider trading and other misdeeds in the securities industry.    Drexel has denied any wrongdoing by the firm or its officials.    The investigation already has led to the downfall of such Wall Street luminaries as arbitrager Ivan Boesky, investment banker Martin A. Siegel and stockbroker Boyd L. Jefferies, all of whom have pleaded guilty to criminal violations of securities laws.    Investigators are said to be focusing on Mr. Milken and his vast network of business contacts. They are said to be particularly interested in some transactions involving Mr. Boesky.    The precise impact of the investigation on Mr. Milken's plans and activities isn't clear. On the advice of his attorneys, Mr. Milken declined to discuss anything having to do with the investigation.    One change that has coincided with the investigation is Mr. Milken's willingness to talk with the press. After turning down interview requests for years, he recently has begun granting them. Last month, Drexel also invited some reporters to hear Mr. Milken give a speech about Mexico.    At the same time, others have been praising him. Attorneys for Mr. Milken have on occasion in recent weeks called him a &quot;national treasure&quot; and in a letter to clients, Drexel referred to the &quot;creative genius&quot; of Mr. Milken.    In the interview, Mr. Milken said one reason for his more public profile was to try to help dispel some of the &quot;misconceptions&quot; that continue to surround high-yield bonds. &quot;I regret that I personally haven't done a better job explaining the benefits&quot; of such securities, said Mr. Milken.    He noted the increasing efforts to restrict high-yield debt, such as a recent move by New York state regulators to limit junk-bond holdings by insurance companies. Congress also is looking at restrictions, urged on by some top corporate executives and others fearful of the role junk bonds have had in the financing of hostile takeover efforts.    Though Drexel has been involved in some of the biggest and most controversial takeover battles of recent years, such efforts make up only a small part of the firm's junk-bond business, said Mr. Milken. Most of Drexel's high-yield-bond money has gone to finance the growth of companies. Most of the debt financing for takeovers comes from bank borrowings, Mr. Milken said.    Mr. Milken also maintained that the risk of junk bonds has been overblown by critics. He said that despite carrying interest rates as much as several percentage points above top-rated securities, Drexelissued junk bonds have had a default rate of well under 2% and a loss rate of less than 0.5%. &quot;It is a record we are extremely proud of,&quot; he said.    But for those who won't or can't buy junk bonds, Mr. Milken hopes soon to be able to offer them something else. The idea, he said, would be to establish a firm that would buy a diversified portfolio of high-yield debt. Interest payments from that debt would provide the company's revenue.    This company then would sell its own debt and equity with the firm's capital structure and cash flow designed to ensure it received an investment-grade rating on its debt.    &quot;Theoretically, a very high percentage of the high-yield market could be absorbed&quot; by this method, said Mr. Milken.    &quot;Such a company's financial structure really wouldn't be any different than banks and other financial institutions of today,&quot; he added. &quot;If you take such an institution's assets individually most of them probably wouldn't be investment grade. But the institution, as a whole, is.&quot;    Mr. Milken said that as much as 25% of his time in coming months will be devoted to his Latin America project. &quot;We plan in the near future to put together an association of individuals and corporations to focus on investments in Latin America,&quot; he said.    Through member contributions, he said he hoped to raise an equity pool &quot;of a few hundred million dollars or more.&quot; Efforts would include forming joint ventures with businessmen in Latin America to build manufacturing facilities and entering into licensing agreements to export products.    He has begun talking to corporate executives about his idea. Though he has received a &quot;number of indications of interest,&quot; Mr. Milken conceded that &quot;a lot of people are skeptical&quot; still about the proposal.    Mr. Milken made it clear that he remains interested in who owns American corporations. Drexel has long favored financing companies where managers hold a major piece of the stock. Last year, the management of the average Drexel customer owned more than 25% of the company.    &quot;The next great change will be to get a larger and larger share of employees involved in owning part of their companies,&quot; said Mr. Milken. Though employee ownership isn't a new idea, he said he believes it is about to take off.    Mr. Milken said he has been talking to union leaders and others about more employee investments. He estimated that such transactions could total several billion dollars in the next two years. </TEXT></DOC>
