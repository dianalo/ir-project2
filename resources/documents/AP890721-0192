Situated in a storm-tossed alley at the head of the Bay ofBengal, Bangladesh is alternately seared by droughts or awash intidal waves and monsoon floods. It is pummeled by tornadoes andsmashed by cyclones or hurricanes roaring in from the sea.   Bangladeshis die by the thousands.   Overloaded river ferries capsize with a regularity that tends totrivialize the tragedy, drowning dozens and sometimes hundreds ofpeople at a time.   Strikes and riots by political parties, trade unions and Moslemfundamentalists recur virtually every week, usually ending inconfrontations with police in which a score or more protesters arewounded and a few die.   But for most of the 110 million Bangladeshis, life goes on butonly on the edge.   The average annual income is $160 a year. Eighty percent of thepeople live below the poverty line, which means they can't obtainminimum daily nutritional needs. At least 70 percent are illiterate.   The plight of Mohammad Nobu, a 25-year-old farmer, is typical ofwhat can happen to a Bangladeshi.   His one acre of land at the hamlet of Hargaj, 25 miles northwestof Dhaka, provided enough rice and vegetables for his family. Heusually kept a cow and some chickens _ to sell, not to eat, becausemoney lasts longer than meat.   But last fall he lost his rice crop to floods that submergedthree-fourths of the nation and killed an estimated 1,400 people.   His next crop, winter lentils and vegetables, was washed away byheavy rains.   In April he lost his spring rice to tornadoes that killedanother 1,400 people, including his mother and aunt. He said thestorm also destroyed his tin-roofed bamboo hut and blew away ``abig cow that I would have sold for 5,000 takas'' _ $152.   Nobu, his wife and two small children now subsist on monthlyhandouts: 33 pounds of rice from the government and 66 pounds offlour from a private relief organization.   ``It's all right,'' he said. ``We are surviving. We are waitingfor Allah's mercy.''   In 1970, before it became independent from Pakistan, a hurricanekilled a million people in what then was East Pakistan. In 1985, ahurricane and tidal way swept away 20,000 lives. This pastNovember, a cyclone killed 1,100.   While people like Nobu await the mercy of Allah, the mercy ofwealthier nations in large part keeps Bangladesh going, to the tuneof $2 billion a year _ an amount equal to the country's annualoperating budget.   But Bangladeshis and foreigners alike worry about the countrybecoming too dependent on handouts.   ``We have to prove to the world that Bangladesh is somethingmore than a poor country,'' President Hussain Muhammad Ershad saidrecently while speaking of his desire to modernize his nation.   In the meantime, the former army general who seized power in abloodless coup in 1982, has marshaled wide international support.   ``Western donors are not unhappy with Ershad because he'sprovided stability and there's been a vast improvement in humanrights,'' one foreign observer said, speaking on condition he wasnot identified further.   Bangladesh has had nine presidents since its 1971 independencewar with Pakistan in which 3 million people died. The only twopresidents who lasted longer than a few months were assassinated.Leaders have never been installed by popular election.   Foreign aid officials said Bangladesh has become such a popularcause that they sometimes try to dissuade their governments frompumping more money into an aid pipeline that has a five-yearbacklog and a dispersal rate of 18 percent.   Sheik Hasina, the daughter of independence leader Sheik MujiburRahman and head of his Awami League that has been at the forefrontof the campaign to oust Ershad, contends that Bangladesh must weanitself from foreign aid and achieve ``economic emancipation.''   Her father, Bangladesh's first president, was assassinated in1975 by young army officers in a coup in which his wife, three sonsand other relatives also were slain. Hasina, who says Sheik is hername and not a title, was in India at the time and returned laterto pick up her father's political mantle.   The key to Bangladesh's problems, she said in a recentinterview, is a literacy campaign that would generate abetter-skilled work force for an export-oriented economy.</TEXT><NOTE>MORE</NOTE></DOC>
