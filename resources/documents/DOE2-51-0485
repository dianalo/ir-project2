Regular measurementson Mauna Loa (Hawaii) since 1958 substantiate the rise in this gas, which,in the first place, is due to the combustion of fossil energy carriers.A further cause is the clearing of tropical forests. The preindustrialcontent of carbon dioxide can be seen by tree-ring and ice core analyses.The oceans are the main sink for carbon dioxide, but their future pollutabilityis uncertain. Oceans also have a damping effect on the rise in temperatureto be expected. The observed global temperature shows a rise of about0.5 degrees K since the beginning of the century.</TEXT></DOC>
