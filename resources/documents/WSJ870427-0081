A company spokesman said these actions are part of an effort to reduce costs across the board by 3% this year. &quot;This is not a drastic step,&quot; he said. &quot;Chrysler has gone through four years of boom, and we have been expanding rapidly. There is a tendency in any company with success to let costs increase, and our top management wanted to be cost-conscious.&quot;    He also said that Chrysler's break-even point -- the production level it must reach before beginning to turn a profit -- also has risen from the 1.1 million vehicles a year or so ago. The spokesman declined to estimate the current break-even point. The spokesman said top Chrysler executives reviewed company expenses last summer and decided recently to take action in light of the increasing competition in the auto market and the declining industrywide auto sales from last year's strong levels.    Chrysler's move follows General Motors Corp.'s much broader and deeper overhaul of the company's financial compensation for salaried ranks. GM isn't giving merit raises this year and instead is offering lump-sum payments that won't be included in the base pay. GM also recently replaced its cash bonus program with stock options. GM, which is in the midst of slashing a quarter of its force of 150,000 salaried employees, is considered to be the highest-cost manufacturer in the industry.    Chrysler said it sent out letters informing the affected salaried employees of the cutbacks early this month. All the changes, which are being phased in this month, will be completed by Friday, the spokesman said.    The No. 3 auto maker said it will cut by 50% the amount of money available for merit pay in the remainder of this year. This is aimed at about 1,800 top bonus-eligible Chrysler officials. Chrysler also suspended its savings plan for those top management people. Under the program, executives were allowed to have money deducted from their paychecks and put in special savings accounts. Chrysler, in turn, matched 50% of the deductions in the accounts. The auto maker said it also plans to change medical and dental benefits for the top employees but it didn't give any details in the letter.    The letter also informed the other 5,200 salaried personnel that they would be paid overtime on a straight-time basis instead of the time-and-a-half rate the company had been paying.    The Chrysler spokesman said the company is scheduled to review its costs again this September, and what further actions, if any, it might take would depend upon &quot;how we're doing.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
