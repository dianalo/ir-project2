 Multimedia is nowstruggling to do the same.andP;  The questions are, can they work together, howcan they work together, and does interactive multimedia pose a potentialthreat to the others?andM;Multimedia suffers terribly from the lack of a standard definition.andP;  Hardwaremanufacturers use it as a computer workstation marketing term, softwaredevelopers think of it as digital media and the business community views itas presentations.andP;  Yet there is one point on which all parties seem to agree-- multimedia represents an exciting, multidimensional way of generating andpresenting ideas.andM;In advertising, multimedia technology is found in tools for developing newbusiness, production, presentation, in-house training, and is even becomingaccepted as a legitimate advertising vehicle.andM;The ultimate sales toolandM;One of multimedia's most popular applications within agencies is new buinesspresentations.andP;  As one of the granddaddies of interactive within New York'sagency world, iths not surprising that Ogilvy and Mather presents itscredentials on one of the most sophisicated presentation systems in theindustry.andM;The system was developed by Ogilvy's own Interactive Marketing Group, whichis now part of Sage, an Ogilvy subsidiary.andM;The system, called &quot;Open Book,&quot; consists of four videodiscs that have beenchained together, a monitor, a VCR and a printer.andP;  This system allows viewersto create a custom version of the agency's video demo reel.andM;&quot;In most agencies, you go in for a new business presentation and the agencyshows you its 10 best commercials,&quot; says Martin Nisenholtz, president of theInteractive Marketing Group.andP;  &quot;Our view is that any of the commercials thatwe have created over the past few years should be on view for the client.&quot;andM;The system offers a menu of 200 commercials and asks the prospective clientto select 10.andP;  The spots are categorized so that, for example, if a prospectis especially interested in travel, he can pick 10 travel commercials, usinga familiar telephone keypad.andM;Next, the system copies the chosen spots on a videotape that the viewer cantake.andP;  For easy reference, a printer creates a list of the selection.andM;The system is not unlike the successful Personics in-store cassettetape-making system, which also uses a telephone keypad as the user controland creates a custom audio tape with custom label.andM;From storyboards to animaticsandM;With the advent of computer-generated animatics (sequences of sketches toillustrate a video or film idea), art directors have been able to modernizeone of the agency world's traditions: the storyboard (a series of stillimages on boards).andP;  Using a personal computer to create an animatic, creativestaffers are able to generate more ideas in less time.andP;  The closer thepresentation looks to the final spot, the easier it seems to be for theclient to understand it.andP;  Ultimately, a good presentation leads to fasterapproval.andM;&quot;Writing words on a piece of paper and laying them against the storyboard isnot the way we experience a commercial,&quot; says Robert Abel, president andcreative director of AND Communications.andP;  What you have to do is create inthe same medium in which the commercial will eventually be seen.andP;  Within themultimedia computing environment, that's relatively easy to accomplish.&quot;andM;Unfortunately, this capability is not without problems.andP;  Geoffrey Katz, thegraphics systems specialist at Foote, Cone andamp; Belding in San Francisco, says,&quot;Because the animatics are so much more finished-looking than thestoryboards, clients often take them too literally, consequently leavinglittle room for interpretation.&quot;andM;Damian Pezzano, senior vice president and director of computer systems atBBDO in New York, adds, &quot;We have producers who would rather stick needles intheir eyes than have the client shown an animatic.andP;  Too often, the clientsigns off on an animatic and expects it to be shot frame-for-frame when thecommercial comes out.andP;  I think the solution is to get the producer to help usproduce the animatic, so that the animatic we show the client is what we puton film.andP;  It's funny, art directors share the opposite view of producers.andO;They prefer animatics because the tighter they are, the greater chance thattheir original concept will end up on film.&quot;andM;Client presentationsandM;Tyler Peppel, Apple's manager of media integration products, says he likes topresent directly from the computer screen because it gives him full controlover content.andP;  He also cites the ability to browse easily within thepresentation and, unlike traditional slide shows, make changes at the lastminute.andM;Many agencies use laserdiscs to catalog a variety of data -- for internal aswell as presentation purposes.andP;  For some agencies, a single disc can storeeverything it has ever produced in print, radio or television as well asmarketing information, graphics, animation and sound.andM;Multimedia as a legitimate advertising platformandM;Alth ough most ad agencies are unaware of what multimedia can do, many of thecountry's more progressive agencies are beginning to experiment with theconcept of interactive computer-based advertising.andP;  This new electronicchannel of communication has grown to include interactive software, in-storekiosks and on-line, advertising-based services such as the IBM/Sears venture,Prodigy.andM;Computer-based advertising may not reach a huge base, but it is verytargeted, says Kent Valandra, manager of advertising and marketing atProdigy.andM;&quot;Think about it,&quot; Valandra says.andP;  &quot;Every member of your audience is sittingwith both hands on the keyboard and both eyes on the screen looking at yourad.andP;  No other medium gives you such a distinct advantage.&quot;andM;There are a number of benefits that interactivity brings to communications.andO;One of the most significant is specificity.andP;  Nisenholtz cites an example: &quot;Ifyou're in the financial services industry and you want to reach someone witha message that's tailored specifically to them, interactivity is the best wayto do it.andP;  For companies like banks, disk-based advertising allows them tocommunicate much more directly with their prospects.&quot;andM;In addition to disk-based advertising, which reaches a specific group ofindividuals, in-store kiosks have proven effective in reaching a larger andmore diversified audience.andM;&quot;Point-of-sale is a particularly important place to communicate, since peopleoften make in-store purchase decisions,&quot; Nisenholtz says.andP;  &quot;If you cancommunicate to these people in an exciting way before they get to the cashregister, then you're better off than another supplier who isn'tcommunicating that way.&quot;andM;Among on-line services, Prodigy seems to gaining greatest popularity amongunsophisticated computer users.andP;  One of its greatest selling points is thatunlike others, it doesn't charge by the hour, but rather a low monthly fee.andO;Prodigy's members appear to use the service primarily for shopping, banking,buying discount airline tickets and for playing games.andM;Prodigy has more than 200 advertisers and more than 200,000 subscribers.andO;Although the advertising on Prodigy is relatively unsophisticated due totechnical limitations, it appears to be working for advertisers and formembers.andP;  Apparently members don't mind the advertising since they know ithelps underwrite the cost of the service.andM;J.andP;  Walter Thompson USA has an interactive division in Detroit called OnLine,which represents the interests of the agency worldwide.andP;  Ford is OnLine'sonly active client.andP;  OnLine advertises Ford on Prodigy, CompuServe and GEnie(General Electric).andP;  OnLine has also worked with outside vendors to produceinteractive advertising disks such as the Ford Simulator, a $6.95 sales tool(Macintosh and DOS versions) that offers a fairly extensive drivingsimulation game pitting users against the computer.andP;  The extent to which thatdisk has penetrated its target audience and generated sales is unclear.andP;  Itallows users to scan through a complete line of Ford products, options,models and prices.andP;  After designing the car of choice to their exactspecifications, they can print their own window sticker and take it into thedealer.andM;Multimedia as an in-house training toolandM;BBDO, New York, is considering multimedia as a replacement for its annualNetwork Training Conference.andM;&quot;What we've done in the past is select 40 to 50 outstanding employees out of3,500 worldwide, who we want to groom for management,&quot; says Pezzano.andP;  &quot;Thatmeans we're spending $500,000 annually on only 1 percent of our workforce,and these are the people who I feel probably need the training least.andP;  Thesuperstars will always ben superstars.andP;  The people who really need thetraining are middle-management types as well as underachievers.andP;  Bydeveloping a series of in-house computer-based training programs, even if itcosts a little more than what we've been spending, a lot more people willbenefit.&quot;andM;Making the numbers workandM;While a lot of agencies' resistance to multimedia typically is attributed toeconomics, it can reduce an agencyhs costs in several areas.andO;Computer-generated animatics can save the agency up to half of the cost ofhaving them produced outside, not to mention the time it saves.andP;  Savings canalso be attributed to computer-generated type, comps (ad layout proposals)and even full-blown ads.andM;On-line advertising can also be shown to be cost-effective.andP;  Unlike print andtelevision, Prodigy bills its advertisers entirely on the basis of whoaccesses their advertising.andP;  It also offers agencies a 15 percent commission.andO;Each month, Prodigy's advertisers receive reports with a complete analysis byage, sex and location of each member who has accessed any of their ads.andP;  Infact, Prodigy can actually give its advertisers an analysis of how manypeople looked at how many screens (ads can be 10 to 50 screens).andM;Obstacles that have yet to be overcomeandM;Because interactive multimedia is so new, and so few people understand how itcan be used as a communications medium, it rarely is recommended.andM;&quot;As innovative and creative as agencies are cracked up to be, they'reessentially a business that's set up to make money in certain ways,&quot; says RobFulop of Interactive Productions in Foster City, California.andM;&quot;It's conversion of a way of thinking,&quot; says Robert Abel.andP;  &quot;That's always anobstacle.&quot;andM;Agencies are usually more conservative than the companies they serve, when itcomes to trying new media.andP;  For example, Prodigy's first 60 advertisingclients were companies, not agencies.andM;The only way this resistance can be overcome is with time, education andpossibly by approaching agencies through their sales promotion or directresponse divisions, allowing interactive advertising to complement anexisting campaign.andM;Probably the most immediate way that agencies will get started in multimediais to bring computers into their production departments.andP;  That's where thebenefits are most likely to impact the bottom line the fastest.andP;  Once thenumbers start telling their story and the creative staff realizes theequipment's capabilities, the hard sell is over.andM;Another objection that agencies echo is not having the luxury of time to getup to speed on software.andM;One of the more substantive issues that agencies are grappling with is, &quot;Ifwe stop using outside services, how are we going to make up for lostcommissions?&quot;andP;  The solution is relatively simple.andP;  Apple's Tyler Peppelsuggests that agencies establish an in-house technology division.andM;&quot;All you need is an empty room,&quot; Peppel says.andP;  &quot;By having a separate profitcenter, the agency can keep track of its costs more efficiently while holdingonto its traditional billing structure for contracting with outsideservices.&quot;andM;Multimedia also suffers from a lack of tenure.andM;&quot;Because the history is so new, agencies don't have a solid statistical basison which to present a lot of this stuff,&quot; says Nisenholtz.andP;  In contrast,direct marketing has decades of audited numbers reflecting its targets'response rates.andP;  &quot;The problem is not the technology, it's the marketingefficacy of the medium,&quot; Nisenholtz says.andM;While Prodigy has developed a highly refined way of tracking consumerresponse, it still needs to compare its clients' costs of advertising in thismedium to other forms of advertising.andP;  The only way for producers ofmultimedia to convince agencies that it's a viable creative platform is topresent numbers.andP;  Of course, that's going to be a problem in such a youngindustry.andM;Another serious obstacle is the industry's need for a universal softwareplatform.andM;&quot;What we need is one program that integrates recorded sound, video, stills,graphics, text and animation,&quot; Peppel says.andP;  &quot;All of these have to come in apackage that's affordable and simple.andP;  That's what we did in desktoppublishing and what we're planning to do with multimedia as well.&quot;andM;Clement Mok, owner of a design studio in San Francisco, believes that itwon't be long before all of the &quot;plumbing&quot; is worked out.andM;&quot;In the long run, platform and performance issues aren't really going todrive multimedia,&quot; Mok says.andP;  &quot;Content will.&quot;andM;Other technological considerations include the need for larger storagecapabilities for large data files of graphics, animation and sound, as wellas faster data transmission.andM;A medium without a message?andM;There is concern among industry professionals as to whether or not multimediais now driven by technology or content.andM;&quot;Right now, multimedia has a lot of publishers, but no authors,&quot; Mok says.andO;&quot;Sure, there's a lot of noise out th ere, along with flashy triangles,shimmers, wipes and dissolves, but no content.andP;  People are just archiving.andO;When you look at books, television, radio and all other media, there'ssomeone directing with a point of view, someone who's making the medium andinformation compelling to understand and interesting to look at.andP;  That's nothappening in this medium yet.&quot;andM;Moving from the age of information to the age of ideasandM;How long will it be before multimedia is accepted among agencies and theirclients as a viable creative platform?andP;  Industry estimates rage from two to15 years.andP;  By the year 2000, infrastructure will be in place to makemultimedia a major mainstream advertising medium.andP;  Fiber optic communicationswill be standard mode of digital data transmission among businesses acrossthe nation.andP;  Video conferencing will probably be as commonplace as faxes aretoday.andP;  On-line services such as Prodigy and CompuServe are likely to havelots of company.andM;Robert Abel predicts that in the next decade, the actual transmission ofideas to people is likely to shift from normal television transmission to&quot;smart TVs&quot; -- televisions fused with computers.andM;&quot;Once that happens, I don't think we'll ever use television sets like we usedto,&quot; Abel says.andM;How will all this affect the world of creativity?andP;  Abel contends that &quot;trueinteractive multimedia signals the transition from the age of informationinto the age of ideas.&quot;andP;  The method of creating the idea and the method ofdelivering the idea, to the client and ultimately to the consumer, arechanging dramatically.andP;  Within a few years' time, these changes will mostlikely be reflected in significant organizational changes, which couldthreaten the roles of creative directors, art directors, producers anddirectors.andM;&quot;Advertising agencies have become like characters out of a Faulkner novel,&quot;Abel concludes.andP;  &quot;They're like the Snopes family.andP;  After three generations,these people had become so inbred that they could barely function properly.andO;The same goes for agencies.andP;  The problem is, agencies are paid to convincepeople -- in a very short period of time -- to buy their clients' products.andO;because agencies are so tied to tradition, they continue to recommendmagazines, billboards, radio and television.andP;  Those media simply don't workany more.andP;  People don't see them, hear them or watch them.andP;  Yet the priceskeep going up.andP;  It's patently absurd.andP;  That's one of the reasons I left theadvertising business.andP;  I didn't want to be in the silent movie business whenI knew that talkies were coming.&quot;andM;So who's going to take the plunge?andP;  Ultimately, it may have to be the client.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
