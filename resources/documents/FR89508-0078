The consequences of an accident could increase only if the accidentis postulated to occur while one radiation monitor is out of service andthe other fails simultaneously. In that situation, the ESF would not beactuated on a high radiation condition. However, the Technical Specificationsrequire immediate action (within 1 hour) if the appropriate number of monitorsare not operable. Consequently, there is no significant hazard associatedwith the change. Moreover, the slightly increased consequences of suchan accident would not affect offsite releases. Therefore, the proposedchanges only very slightly increase the consequences of accidents, no changesare being made in the types of any effluents that may be released offsite,and there is no significant increase in the allowable individual or cumulativeoccupational radiation exposure. Accordingly, the Commission concludesthat this proposed action would result in no significant radiological environmentalimpact.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed changeinvolves systems located within the restricted area as defined in 10 CFRPart 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluents and has noother environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludes that thereare no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associated withthe proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 12, 1988 (53 FR 35244). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.Alternatives to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternative withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action does not involve the use of any resources not previously consideredin the Final Environmental Statement (NUREG-171) for the South Texas Project,Units 1 and 2.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For information concerning this action, see the application of amendmentdated February 24, 1988, which is available for public inspection at theCommission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street NW., Washington, DC, andat the Wharton County Junior College, J.M.
