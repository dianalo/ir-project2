<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-36-0367 </DOCNO><TEXT>A systematic study involving the effects of temperatures and differentatmospheres on the formation of Ba/sub 2/YCu/sub 3/O/sub x/ was performed.The gases used were oxygen, air, nitrogen, carbon-dioxide and carbon-monoxide.The solid state synthesis procedure employed gave an XRD pattern whichindexed phase pure in the orthorhombic system. A narrow temperature rangefor calcining was found to be the most crucial parameter for obtainingreproducible and phase pure superconducting powder. The results of thiswork offer significant suggestions for the processing of Ba/sub 2/YCu/sub3/O/sub x/. 8 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
