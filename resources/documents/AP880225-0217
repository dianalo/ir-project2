Regansaid in a deposition released Thursday.   Regan's account of the arms-for-hostages program was revealed indepositions taken last summer by the congressional Iran-Contracommittees.   Regan said that at first he supported the idea of allowingIsrael to sell U.S.-made weapons to Iran in September 1985 inreturn for freeing American hostages held by pro-Iranian terroristsin Lebanon.   ``I thought it was worth pursuing,'' Regan said of theinitiative. ``It was an opening. I thought we should explore it.''   By December, Regan said he had changed his mind. Anothershipment of weapons was sent to Iran in November, but only onehostage _ the Rev. Benjamin Weir _ was freed in the fall of 1985.   Asked why, Regan said: ``Well, the thing had been a fiasco up tothat point, in my judgment it had not worked. We were dealing withsome very unusual people.   ``We were fooling around for the better part of six months withvery little results to show for it, and I couldn't see the value ofpursuing that avenue any more. I thought we were dealing eitherwith the wrong people or in the wrong way.''   But Regan said John M. Poindexter, the former national securityadviser, convinced him to go along with the more shipments.Poindexter told President Reagan and Regan that ``there was a wholenew lead and a whole new plan and that it might turn thing around.''   In addition, Regan said the president, Vice President GeorgeBush and Poindexter received some unsettling news from Robert F.McFarlane, who had been Poindexter's predecessor at the NationalSecurity Council.   McFarlane, who continued to work on the hostage project afterhis resignation from the NSC, traveled to London in December tomeet Manucher Ghorbanifar, a middleman in the U.S.-Iranrelationship.   Regan was asked whether on his return McFarlane indicated thatif discussions with the Iranians were terminated, the hostagescould be killed.   ``Yes,'' replied the former chief of staff.   ``This was becoming increasingly evident, that unless we got ona new tack, we would (a) probably never see our hostages; or (b)the whole project would end in dismal failure,'' Regan said.   In January 1986, the United States began shipping weaponsdirectly to Iran. The project ended in November after revelationsthat profits from the sale of weapons to Iran had been diverted tothe Nicaraguan Contras. Nine Americans remain hostage in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
