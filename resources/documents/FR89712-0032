These amendments are needed to conform EPA'srule with recent agreements reached by the Parties to the Montreal Protocolconcerning the implementation of the Protocol. The first proposed amendmentimplements the Parties' interpretation of ``industrial rationalization'',a term in the control article of the Protocol. According to the Parties'interpretation, a Party can only increase its production of controlledsubstances by specified amounts if there is a documented, correspondingdecrease in production by another Party, or if the increase in productionis exported to Parties operating under Article 5 of the Protocol (In today'snotice, the Agency proposes Appendix E, ``Article 5 Parties'', developingcountries that are Party to the Protocol and have a per capita consumptionof less than .3 kg.). EPA's current rule, however, allows an increase upto the production limits for exports to <T3>any</T3> Party. The second proposed amendment, also based on an agreementreached by the Parties, expands the definition of exports to include usedand recycled controlled substances. The Agency also proposes to grant additionalallowances or credits to any person who uses controlled substances as afeedstock for other substances. The proposed amendments detail the necessaryreporting and recordkeeping requirements. The current rule only grantssuch allowances to the person who produces and then consumes the controlledsubstance as a feedstock.Finally, the Agency proposes a new record keeping requirement for producersof controlled substances. The proposal requires producers to maintain recordsof the date and estimated quantity of any spills or releases of controlledsubstances.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2>A public hearing on the proposed rule published today willbe held on July 27, 1989, if any interested party notifies EPA before thatdate that it wishes to present oral testimony.

The rule requires a near-term freeze at 1986 levels ofproduction and consumption (defined as production plus imports minus exports)of CFC-11,</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">-12, -113, -114, and -115 based on their relative ozone depletionweights, followed by a phased reduction to 80 percent and 50 percent of1986 levels beginning in mid-1993 and mid-1998, respectively. It also limitsproduction and consumption of Halon 1211, 1301, and 2402 to 1986 levelsbeginning as early as 1992. Under specified circumstances, limited increasesin production (but not consumption) above these levels would be permitted.This rule was promulgated under section 157(b) of the Clean Air Act andconstituted the United States' implementation of the Montreal Protocol,which the United States ratified on April 21, 1988. The final rule's controlmeasures took effect when the Protocol entered into force on January 1,1989.The rule implements the Protocol's requirements to control production andconsumption of the CFCs and halons specified above by allocating productionand consumption allowances to firms that produced and imported these chemicalsin 1986, based on their 1986 levels of these activities.Today the Agency proposes to amend several sections for this final rule.Several of these amendments are based on recent agreements concerning implementationof the Montreal Protocol reached by nations that are Parties to the Protocolat their first meeting in Helsinki, Finland, during the week of May 1.The first amendment concerns the Parties' interpretation of Article 2 ofthe Montreal Protocol. Article 2 allows increases in production of bothgroups of controlled substances by as much as 10 percent, and 15 percentfor CFCs after July 1, 1998, if that production is used to satisfy ``thebasic domestic needs'' of developing countries or ``for the purposes ofindustrial rationalization''. Industrial rationalization is defined bythe Protocol as ``the transfer of all or a portion of the calculated levelof production of one party to another, for the purposes of achieving economicefficiencies or responding to anticipated shortfalls in supply as a resultof plant closures.''In its final rule, EPA interpreted the term ``industrial rationalization''to mean trade in controlled substances between Parties. The Agency believedthat the trading provisions of the Protocol created a ``bubble'' of controlledsubstance production. If one Party increased its production by 10 or 15percent, it would have to export that production to other Parties or decreaseits imports from Parties in order to comply with its consumption limits.The Party that imported the increased production would, in turn, have todecrease its own production, or export it to another Party. Since, underthe Montreal Protocol, Parties' consumption limits are held constant whiletheir production may rise somewhat, any increase in production by one Partywould have to be offset by a decrease in production by another Party orParties. Therefore, the Agency believed that exporting to Protocol Partieswas tantamount to a transfer of production, and that the conditions ofindustrial rationalization had been met. Consequently, EPA promulgateda final rule that allowed companies to increase production up to the 10and 15 percent limits specified in the Protocol if the exports were madeto Parties.The first meeting of the Parties was held May 2-5, 1989 in Helsinki, Finland.The Parties met in part to resolve outstanding issues related to implementationof the Montreal Protocol. At the meeting, the Parties determined that theterm ``industrial rationalization'' means a documented transfer of productionrights, requiring a Party desiring to increase its production ``for thepurposes of industrial rationalization'' to obtain the agreement of anotherParty to decrease its production by the same amount. To comply with theParties' interpretation of industrial rationalization, and to ensure internationallyconsistent implementation of the terms of the Montreal Protocol EPA proposesto amend its final rule to require any person seeking to increase its productionfor the purposes of industrial rationalization to obtain and document theagreement of another Party to offset that increase.Specifically, EPA proposes to modify two sections of the final regulation.The Agency proposes to amend andSection; 82.9(c) under which a person mayobtain authorization to convert potential production allowances to actualproduction allowances, or reduce his available production allowances tothe extent he provides a documented transfer of production. To documenta transfer from a Party, a person must obtain a written statement fromthe Party's U.S. embassy that the Party agrees to reduce its productionallowances by the calculated level of the production to be transferred.To document a transfer to a Party, a person must obtain a written statementfrom the Party's U.S. embassy acknowledging that the Party has agreed tothe transfer. For transfers to a Party for the purposes of industrial rationalization,the Agency will review the transfer request and approve the transfer ifthe company has sufficient allowances to trade. In today's notice the Agencyrequests comments on whether there is a need to consider other factorssuch as the transfer's potential impact on the domestic economy, U.S. tradeand the environmental implications. All transfer requests must includethe requisite document from the embassy, the name and address of the personsubmitting the request and his contact, the name and address of the Partyinvolved in the transfer and its contacts, the amount of allowable authorizationto convert requested or production transferred, and the control periodsto which the transfer applies.In addition, the Agency will also amend andSection; 82.11 to state that authorizationsto convert potential production allowances will also be granted upon proofof exports to Parties operating under Article 5 of the Protocol and listedin proposed Appendix E to EPA's regulations.The Agency also proposes Appendix E, ``Article 5 Parties''. The countriesthat are listed in Appendix E are (1) Parties fo the Protocol, (2) developingcountries agreed to by the Parties, and (3) are believed by the UnitedNations Environmental Programme (UNEP) to have an annual per capita consumptionof controlled substances of less than .3 kilograms. UNEP has not receivedconsumption figures from all Parties that are developing countries. TheAgency believes that it is necessary to publish this proposed list, basedon the most recent information from UNEP, for comment so that affectedpersons may take advantage of the provisions of the final rule that allowincreased production for exports to Article 5 Parties as soon as possible.The Agency believes that this proposed list is not likely to change afterUNEP has received all consumption figures from all Parties.EPA also proposes today to expand the definition of exports to includecontrolled substances that are either used or recycled (andSection; 82.3(h)). In the final rule published last August, EPA excluded recycled andused control substances from the definition of exports, excluded exportsof such substances from the reporting requirements and precluded exportingcompanies from claiming additional consumption allowances under andSection;82.10 and authorization to convert under andSection; 82.11 for exports ofsuch substances. The Agency was concerned at that time that defining exportsto include recycled and used controlled substances along with virgin controlledsubstances would risk U.S. noncompliance with the Protocol. Since the Agency'srule defines production to exclude recycled controlled substances, firmscould recycle those substances without expending production and consumptionallowances. However, if export is defined to include recycled substances,on exporting the recycled substances firms would receive authorizationto convert potential production allowances in the amount of the recycledsubstances exported. Thus, as a result of exporting recycled substancesfor which no production and consumption allowances were expended, firmswould realize a net increase in production allowances (up to the 10 or15 percent limit on potential production allowances) and consumption allowances.They could then use these additional allowances to produce or import andsell domestically controlled substances in excess of the amount of theinitial allocations authorized.At their Helsinki meeting the Parties to the Protocol agreed that exportsshould be defined to include virgin and recycled or used controlled substancesto facilitate recycling efforts by countries that do not have recyclingfacilities. The Parties' definition allows such countries to export theirused controlled substances and then re-import the reprocessed or recycledcontrolled substance without expending consumption allowances or credits.The Parties stated that recycling is an important control option to limitthe production of additional controlled substances and should be encouragedwherever possible.The Agency proposes to amend the definition of exports to include recycledor used controlled substances in accordance with the agreement reachedby the Parties in Helsinki. The Agency believes that the U.S. domesticprogram should be consistent with the internationally accepted definitionsreached by agreement by the Parties. In this case, the expanded definitionof exports benefits domestic recycling companies that intend to trade inused and recycled controlled substances.The Agency further believes that defining exports under the U.S. rule toinclude recycled or used controlled substances will have no adverse effecton stratospheric ozone levels. Controlled substances produced, recycledand exported all in the same control period will not yield a net increasein consumption allowances since consumption allowances were expended andrecouped in the same control period. Controlled substances produced, recycledand exported in different control periods will also not affect the ozonelayer. A controlled substance eventually recycled could have been releasedor emitted during the control period when it was produced and when consumptionallowances were expended for it. Instead, recycling results in the consumptionor use (in the sense of emission) of a substance being transferred fromthe period it was produced to the period it was exported. Thus, the neteffect on the environment would be zero since all that occurred was aninter-temporal transfer of consumption (or emissions) from one controlperiod to another. Since the proposed change will have no adverse environmentaleffect, and since the Parties to the Protocol have agreed to this definitionof exports, the Agency proposes to expand the definition of exports inits rule to include used or recycled controlled substances.The Agency also proposes to amend the final rule to allow persons who consumeor transform purchased controlled substances as feedstock for other substancesto claim an allowance credit equal to the allowances expended for the productionor importation of the transformed controlled substance (andSection; 82.9(e)and 82.10(c)). Currently only persons who produce and then consume thecontrolled substance in the production of other substances can deduct theamount of controlled substances from the allowance limits set by the finalrule.The Agency stated last August that tracking controlled substances producedand transformed by different persons would be administratively burdensome,and present verification problems for compliance or enforcement proceedings.Furthermore, the Agency could not resolve at the time whether the personwho produced the controlled substance or the person who transformed thecontrolled substance should receive the credit. This issue was even moredifficult to resolve where transformations involve controlled substancesproduced in another country. Last year, technical advisors to the Protocolmeeting in Nairobi could not agree on which country should be granted creditsin the case of transformation of feedstocks traded between countries.At their meeting in Helsinki, the Parties resolved this issue and agreedthat each Party could exclude from its production totals any manufacturedcontrolled substance that is entirely used as feedstock. Based on thisagreement, the Agency proposes to allow companies that use controlled substancesas feedstock to claim allowance credits equal to the allowances that wereexpended to either import or produce these substances, regardless of whooriginally produced or imported the controlled substance.The Agency proposes that any person that consumes as feedstocks for anysubstance, controlled substances it did not produce may request productionand/or consumption allowances equal to the calculated level of the controlledsubstance used and consumed as feedstocks. To receive these allowances,a person must report the type and quantity of controlled substance transformed,the resulting product of the transformation, the quantity of the producttransformed, and indicate that the product is used commercially. The personmust also submit a copy of the invoice or receipt documenting the saleof the controlled substances that were transformed and such other informationas may be necessary to trace the origin of the controlled substance. TheAgency requires such information to verify and determine whether productionand consumption allowances were expended for the domestic use of the controlledsubstance (For example, no allowances would have been expended for controlledsubstances produced before July 1, 1989.) and to verify that the controlledsubstance was transformed into another substance rather than destroyed.(Parties to the Protocol have not yet approved destruction technologiesused to destroy controlled substances for the purposes of receiving productioncredit.) Such persons who do request additional consumption and productionallowances must maintain dated records of the type and quantity of thecontrolled substance transformed, the quantity of the resulting product,and any shipping records that verify the sale of the resulting product(andSection; 82.13(h)).After reviewing this information, the Agency will issue a notice grantingadditional consumption allowances for transformed controlled substancesthat were imported, or additional production and consumption allowancesfor transformation of controlled substances that were produced domestically.Granted allowances will equal the calculated level of the transformed controlledsubstance, and will only be valid for the control period in which the transformationoccurred. Such allowances will entitle the holder to either produce orimport additional controlled substances and may be traded to other persons.The August 12 final rule already provides that producers of controlledsubstances may subtract from their production and consumption the calculatedlevel of controlled substances produced by that company that are consumedas feedstocks. In accordance with the proposal that purchasers of controlledsubstances receive allowances for controlled substances that are consumed,the Agency is also proposing to allow producers of controlled substanceswho consume controlled substances produced by a different person to subtractthat level of controlled substance from its calculated levels of productionand consumption. The current wording of the record keeping and reportingrequirements at andSection; 82.13 (f)(2)(ii) and (f)(3)(i) is already broadenough to apply to all producers, whether or not the controlled substanceused as feedstock was manufactured by that person. Therefore, in orderto qualify for credit for the consumption of feedstocks, producers needto keep the records and make the reports required by andSection;andSection;82.13(f)(2)(ii) and 82.13(f)(3)(i) as well as proposed andSection; 82.13(h).Finally, the Agency proposes to add an additional recordkeeping requirementfor producers of controlled substances (andSection; 82.13(f)(2)(vii)). Inthe final rule of last August, the Agency did not anticipate spills asreleases or emission of controlled substances that may be excluded fromthe volume of produced controlled substance measured under typical accountingprocedures by producers and reported to EPA. Indeed, spills could be avery sizeable emission of controlled substances to the atmosphere whichmay not be recorded under the current recordkeeping requirements. Althoughthe Agency believes that there are financial incentives to minimize spills,EPA proposes that all producers maintain records of any spills or releasesthat occur up until shipment of the controlled substance, and that suchspills be included in the measurement of production. The Agency requestscomments on whether there is a need to specify within this recordkeepingrequirement a ``de minimis'' volume of a spill below which the producersdo not need to record. <ITAG tagnum="84">Additional Information </ITAG>1. Executive Order 12291 Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires the preparation of a regulatory impactanalysis for major rules, defined by the order as those likely to resultin: (1) An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; (2) A major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries,Federal, State or local government agencies, or geographic industries;or (3) Significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment,productivity, innovation or on the ability of the United States-based enterprisesto compete with foreign based enterprises in domestic or export markets.EPA determined that its August 12, 1988, final rule to protect stratosphericozone met with the definition of a major rule, and therefore prepared aregulatory impact analysis (RIA). Since these amendments do not imposeany significant burdens as defined by E.O. 12291, the RIA prepared forthe final rule fulfills the executive order's requirement for these proposals.2. Paperwork Reduction Act Changes to the information requirements as proposed in today's notice havebeen submitted for approval to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)under the Paperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3> An Information Collection Request document has been preparedby EPA (ICR No. 1432.03) and a copy may be obtained by writing Carla Levesque,Information Policy Branch; EPA; 401 M Street SW. (PM-223); Washington,DC 20460 or by calling (202) 382-2468. Public reporting burden for this collection of information is estimatedto increase an average of 5 hours per response, including time for reviewinginstructions, searching existing data sources, gathering and maintainingthe data needed, and completing and reviewing the collection of information.Send comments regarding the burden estimate or any other aspect of thiscollection of information, including suggestions for reducing this burden,to Chief, Information Policy Branch, PM-223, U.S. Environmental ProtectionAgency, 401 M Street, SW., Washington, DC 20460; and to the Office of Informationand Regulatory Affairs, Paperwork Reduction Project (2060-0170), Officeof Management and Budget, Washington, DC 20503, marked ``Attention: DeskOfficer for EPA.'' The final rule will respond to any OMB or public commentson the information collection requirements contained in this proposal.3. Regulatory Flexibility Act The Regulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601-612, requires that Federalagencies examine the impacts of their regulations on small entities. Under5 U.S.C. 604(a), whenever an agency is required to publish a general noticeof proposed rulemaking, it must prepare and make available for public commentan initial regulatory flexibility analysis (RFA). Such an analysis is notrequired if the head of the agency certifies that a rule will not havea significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities,pursuant to 5 U.S.C. 605(b). EPA prepared an initial RFA in support ofits final rule, and no additional RFA need be prepared for these amendments.<ITAG tagnum="21">Date: June 30, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">William K.

L. 98-478) requires the Secretaryof the Interior to take action to encourage responsible bidding. Biddingis considered responsible if it is at such a level that the bidder, ifawarded the contract, would be able to perform the obligations requiredby its provisions. Further, the Act requires the Secretary to take actionto reduce speculative bidding. In practice, the major action taken by theSecretary to address speculative bidding has been greater use of short-termcontracts. Bids on short-term contracts reflect the current value of timber,whereas bidders on long-term contracts are more at the mercy of unanticipatedunfavorable market conditions than are bidders on short-term contracts.Contracts bid since the 1984 Act are being completed on a timely basis.Timber markets have improved with no commensurate increase in availabletimber, thus generating speculation. In response to this, a proposed rulemakingwas published in the February 29, 1988, <T4>Federal Register</T4> (53 FR 6013). This rulemaking was designed todampen speculative bidding and encourage the completion of future timbercontracts by requiring an increase in the minimum performance bond fortimber sale contracts having a bid ratio exceeding 1.25. The bid ratiois the quotient of the total bid price divided by the total appraised price,expressed as a decimal. The rulemaking also proposed removing the existing$500,000 cap on performance bonds and removing personal surety as a typeof acceptable performance bond.Comments on this proposed rule were received from 1 surety association,1 surety management company, 3 forest industry associations, and 1 forestindustry corporation. These comments uniformly expressed their concernsover the accuracy of bid ratios as a measure of speculative bidding andthe equity of additional bonding as a means of ensuring completion of thetimber sale contract. Three industry comments recommended retaining personalsurety as an acceptable type of performance bond. One industry commentsuggested the regulation should apply to both transaction evidence appraisalsand analytical appraisals. With one exception, the comments uniformly supportedthe industry proposal to encourage responsible bidding on, and completionof, timber sale contracts by: (1) Requiring a first-anniversary 20 percentpayment comprised of stumpage payments and/or the value of completed roadconstruction, (2) retaining personal surety as an acceptable type of performancebond, and (3) permitting a 50 percent reduction in the performance bondwhen stumpage payments and/or the value of completed road constructionequals or exceeds 50 percent of the contract purchase price.The Department of the Interior has determined these comments to have meritand has incorporated them into a revised proposed rulemaking which wouldencourage early performance as a means of discouraging speculative bidding.In addition, personal surety would be retained as a type of acceptableperformance bond. As stated before, contracts bid since 1984 are beingcompleted in a timely manner. This has been partially due to the greateruse of shorter term contracts. However, with the projection of increasingcompetition for timber, further measures are needed.The elements of this new proposed rulemaking are as follows: (1) It wouldincrease the cash deposit to one installment (10 percent of purchase price,limited to $50,000 for sales of $500,000 or more). It would hold one-halfof the deposit to satisfy the final payment and release one-half of thedeposit as specified in No. 4 below. (2) It would require payment of 20percent of the total purchase price on the first anniversary of contracts19 months in length or longer. The payment could be reduced by the valueof completed road construction. (3) It would require payment of 40 percentof the total purchase price on the second anniversary of contracts 27 monthsin length or longer. The payment could be reduced by the value of completedroad construction. (4) It would also permit a 50 percent reduction in theperformance bond when 60 percent of the total purchase price has been reachedthrough contract payments plus the value of completed road construction.In addition, at this 60 percent payment point, the aforementioned one-halfof the cash deposit would be released and applied to subsequent payments.The principal authors of the proposed rulemaking are Lyndon Werner, Divisionof Forestry, and David Estola, Oregon State Office, assisted by the staffof the Division of Legislation and Regulatory Management, Bureau of LandManagement.It is hereby determined that this proposed rulemaking does not constitutea major Federal action significantly affecting the quality of the humanenvironment, and that no detailed statement pursuant to section 102(2)(C)of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 (42 U.S.C. 4332(2)(C))is required.The Department of the Interior has determined under Executive Order 12291that this document is not a major rule, and under the Regulatory FlexibilityAct (5 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>) that it will not have a significant economic impact ona substantial number of small entities. Additionally, as required by ExecutiveOrder 12630, the Department has determined that the rulemaking would notcause a taking of private property.This rule does not contain information collection requirements that requireapproval by the Office of Management and Budget under 44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3><ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects</ITAG>43 CFR Part 5450Forests and forest products, Government contracts, Land Management Bureau,Public lands, Reporting and recordkeeping requirements, Surety bonds.43 CFR Part 5460Forests and forest products, Government contracts, Land Management Bureau,Public lands.Under the authority of section 5 of the Act of August 28, 1937 (43 U.S.C.1181e), and the Act of July 31, 1947, as amended (30 U.S.C. 601 <T3>et seq.</T3>), Chapter II of Title 43 of the Code of Federal Regulationsis proposed to be amended as set forth below:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 5450_[AMENDED]</ITAG>1.
