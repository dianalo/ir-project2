The debt consists of industrial revenue and pollution control bonds. Moody's said the upgrade reflects &quot;good progress&quot; made by the company in meeting its operating plan since the leveraged buyout.    ---   PUBLIC SERVICE CO. OF INDIANA -- Moody's said it is considering upgrading ratings on about $1.1 billion of this Plainfield, Ind.-based utility's debt and preferred stock because of likely improvement in the company's financial condition. Under review is Moody's Ba-1 rating on the company's first mortgage bonds and secured pollution control revenue bonds, a Ba-2 rating on unsecured pollution control revenue bonds and a Ba-2 rating on preferred stock. Moody's said a recent utility rate increase improved the company's finances.    ---   UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORP. -- Moody's said it confirmed the ratings on $2.1 billion of debt and $1.6 million of preferred stock of this maker of jet engines, helicopters, elevators and defense and industrial products. The ratings confirmed were the Hartford, Conn.-based company's double-A-3 senior debt, single-A-1 subordinated debt and single-A-1 preferred stock. Moody's said the confirmations were based on the expectation that United Technologies will be successful in lowering operating costs and improving working capital management. The rating concern, which had placed the company under review last December, also noted that United Technologies' core businesses, including its Carrier, Otis and Pratt andamp; Whitney divisions, each has a dominant market position. </TEXT></DOC>
