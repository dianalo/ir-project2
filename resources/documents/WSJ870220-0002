HuntStaff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 02/20/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><TEXT>   New York Gov. Mario Cuomo, one of the dominant figures in the Democratic Party, unexpectedly took himself out of the 1988 presidential race.    At the end of an appearance on a New York City radio call-in program last night, Gov. Cuomo declared that he &quot;will not be a candidate&quot; in 1988. &quot;This decision is the best thing for my state . . . the best thing for my family,&quot; he said, and &quot;the best thing for my party.&quot;    In most public-opinion polls, the 54-year-old governor was the second in popularity as a Democratic presidential candidate, behind former Colorado Sen. Gary Hart. Gov. Cuomo probably is the most forceful and articulate liberal among the potential presidential aspirants, and that wing of the party retains considerable clout in the nominating process.    The Cuomo decision, coming at this stage, doesn't change the presidential picture dramatically. If there is an apparent beneficiary, it is Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, whose expected candidacy probably would have been overshadowed by his fellow governor from a more populous state and with a higher profile.    &quot;Dukakis has his shot now,&quot; said Democratic poll-taker Peter Hart, who currently isn't working for any candidate. &quot;He is in a position to pick up Cuomo support, especially liberals.&quot;    For most of the other candidates, Mr. Cuomo's decision only heightens their expectation that they can rival the front-running Mr. Hart. The former Colorado senator, in terms of polls, political organization and experience in the complex world of presidential politics, is in a commanding position.    Nevertheless, a surprisingly large number of Democratic professionals doubt whether he has the staying power to win the presidency. Whether it is correct or not, such an assessment of Mr. Hart, coupled with the Cuomo withdrawal, is likely to encourage any fence-sitting hopefuls to enter the contest.    Gov. Cuomo said he made his surprise statement last night so that &quot;no one will be disadvantaged by the false expectation of a candidacy on my part.&quot; The governor informed few, if any, political leaders of his decision, displaying his fondness for controlling events.    Despite a powerful political presence, the New York governor has drawn fire for an inexperienced political operation that some politicians thought would seriously impede a national campaign. A recent trip to Los Angeles was criticized by Democratic activists there for an inept performance. But a few days later, Gov. Cuomo wowed an audience in New Orleans, providing him with a political high that probably made it easier for this proud man to decide to withdraw.    Despite his decision not to seek the presidency, Gov. Cuomo will be an important figure in the 1988 Democratic contest. Most candidates will assiduously seek his support, and he might even be an attractive running mate for many of the possible nominees. And the governor's vigorous voice for progressive policies, first recognized nationally when he was the keynote speaker at the Democrats' 1984 convention, will remain in demand.    Last night, when informed in Colorado of the Cuomo decision, a surprised Mr. Hart said he hopes the New York governor &quot;continues to represent a conscience within our party.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
