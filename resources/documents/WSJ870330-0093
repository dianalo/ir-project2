The truth is that not only has the Soviet Union entrenched itself for the long haul in Afghanistan, but it is also already at war with Pakistan. There is no other polite way to describe last week's raids by Soviet-made Afghan fighter-bombers on Pakistani border villages.    More than 200 civilians died in these grisly attacks. They began last Monday when six Afghan air force planes strafed the village of Angur Adar, killing 22. Hours later, 81 villagers of Tera Mangal, west of Peshawar, were killed when bombers fired six rockets and let loose 12 bombs. At least 100 Pakistanis and Afghan refugees were killed on Wednesday when bombers attacked camps near Ribat in southwestern Pakistan. On Thursday, Tera Mangal was attacked again, and at least another five refugees were killed. More bodies remain in the rubble.    Aside from these individual human tragedies, the danger is that this dirty war will help the Soviets bully Pakistan into terrible concessions in Geneva. And the question is, what's the Free World going to do about it?    Too often the response to Soviet expansion has been too little, too late. What still provides hope for Afghanistan -- and Pakistan -- is that the Afghan freedom fighters refuse to surrender. Eight years after the Soviets rolled into Kabul, these anti-Communist rebels are still fighting. Whatever their immediate goals, they are doing more than fighting for their own lost homes. They have become the frontline defense against the Soviet Union on the subcontinent.    What the rest of the Free World can do is support them as if they were fighting for all of us -- which in effect they are. Right now support means even more than providing arms, though it's high time the free countries of Western Europe found the courage to pitch in. What's also needed is an end to the farcical idea that negotiations in Geneva are going to help anyone except the Soviets.    There is little doubt that the Soviet aim with the stepped-up border raids is to intimidate Pakistan into reaching an agreement that would push the rebel bases back over the border into Afghanistan. The villages bombed last week are havens for refugees, and also for the mujahedeen. The message of this bullying is that if the &quot;mujahadeen&quot; are sent home, all will be quiet along the Afghan front.    Unfortunately, there's no reason to think it would be quiet for long. What the Soviet-backed government of Najibullah is negotiating -- and bombing -- for is a timetable for troop withdrawal that would first let Moscow consolidate its hold over Afghanistan. Once that's done, the troops can come and go as needed. The Soviet army has had practice doing exactly that in countries such as Hungary, Czechoslovakia and Poland over the past three decades or so. That would all be much easier in Afghanistan were the freedom fighters removed from their bases at the border.    The idea that the Soviets would then leave Pakistan alone rests on the assumption that Moscow would never risk a war with Pakistan. That's a feeble assumption to make about an expansionist power that is already sending fighter-bombers into Pakistani territory. To cast out the freedom fighters would not stop these attacks. It would merely replace the Afghans in the front lines with Pakistanis. Somehow we don't think that's what Islamabad or its allies hope to achieve in Geneva. </TEXT></DOC>
