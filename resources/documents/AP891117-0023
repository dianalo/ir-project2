The constitutional conflict was created when the Senate approvedthe $9.7 billion measure Thursday and sent it to the White Houseafter weeks of talks aimed at finding a compromise broke down.   A veto would scuttle not only the authorization for most U.S.diplomatic activities, but also a series of trade sanctions againstChina in response to last summer's brutal crackdown onpro-democracy demonstrators.   In a legal provision arising from the Iran-Contra scandal, thebill would bar the president from using U.S. aid money to enticeforeign governments to carry out policies that are contrary toAmerican law.   In a letter to Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C., National SecurityAdviser Brent Scowcroft and Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretaryof state, said the new congressional restrictions would ``severelyhamper the conduct of U.S. foreign policy and would impose anunfair and unreasonable burden on our diplomats and on the conductof our diplomacy and intelligence activities.''   The confrontation left bruised feelings among White House allieson Capitol Hill and anger at White House Counsel C. Boyden Gray.   ``To say that this will be vetoed comes very close to saying thepresidency is above the law,'' said Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan,D-N.Y., who sponsored the provision.   Moynihan said the White House is being controlled on the issueby ``a group of young lawyers'' who are arguing the president hasthe prerogative to set foreign policy, but who are ignoring thatthe Constitution provides for shared powers.   ``It became apparent to me that the lawyers at the White Housegot their noses involved in substance, and not law,'' said Sen.Warren Rudman, R-N.H., who had sought to work out a compromise. ``Ifrankly think it's left some scars that are very deep with peopleup here.''   The bill would prohibit use of U.S. aid money to ``leverage''policy moves by a foreign country that the United States would beunable to carry out itself because of legal restrictions.   It is aimed at situations like one several years ago in whichaid money was expedited to Honduras in exchange for that country'sharboring of the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan Contra rebels, at a timewhen Congress barred direct or indirect U.S. military support forthe rebels.   Moynihan's initiative would provide for criminal penalties forviolators, but made clear that the president would not be barredfrom expressing ``his views to any party on any subject.''   The same fight may well be waged on another front, as well. Asimilar provision, only without the criminal penalties, has beenmade part of the 1990 foreign aid spending bill.   The China sanctions include suspension of risk insurance forcompanies doing business in China, suspension of trade assistance,a freeze on exports of U.S. satellites, a halt to sales ofcontrolled munitions and an end to sale of certain nuclearmaterials and components.</TEXT></DOC>
