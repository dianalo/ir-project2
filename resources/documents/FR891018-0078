Background </ITAG>Pursuant to Public Law (P.L.) 97-415, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission(the Commission) is publishing this regular biweekly notice. P.L. 97-415revised section 189 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (the Act),to require the Commission to publish notice of any amendments issued, orproposed to be issued, under a new provision of section 189 of the Act.This provision grants the Commission the authority to issue and make immediatelyeffective any amendment to an operating license upon a determination bythe Commission that such amendment involves no significant hazards consideration,notwithstanding the pendency before the Commission of a request for a hearingfrom any person. This biweekly notice includes all notices of amendments issued, or proposedto be issued from September 23, 1989 through October 5, 1989. The lastbiweekly notice was published on October 4, 1989 (54 FR 40922). <ITAG tagnum="84">NOTICE OF CONSIDERATION OF ISSUANCE OF AMENDMENT TO FACILITY OPERATINGLICENSE AND PROPOSED NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARDS CONSIDERATION DETERMINATIONAND OPPORTUNITY FOR HEARING </ITAG>The Commission has made a proposed determination that the following amendmentrequests involve no significant hazards consideration. Under the Commission'sregulations in 10 CFR 50.92, this means that operation of the facilityin accordance with the proposed amendments would not (1) involve a significantincrease in the probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated;or (2) create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated; or (3) involve a significant reductionin a margin of safety. The basis for this proposed determination for eachamendment request is shown below. The Commission is seeking public comments on this proposed determination.Any comments received within 30 days after the date of publication of thisnotice will be considered in making any final determination. The Commissionwill not normally make a final determination unless it receives a requestfor a hearing. Written comments may be submitted by mail to the Regulatory PublicationsBranch, Division of Freedom of Information and Publications Services, Officeof Administration, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission, Washington, DC 20555,and should cite the publication date and page number of this <T4>Federal Register </T4> notice. Written comments may also be deliveredto Room P-223, Phillips Building, 7920 Norfolk Avenue, Bethesda, Marylandfrom 7:30 a.m. to 4:15 p.m. Copies of written comments received may beexamined at the NRC Public Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street,NW., Washington, DC. The filing of requests for hearing and petitions forleave to intervene is discussed below. By November 17, 1989, the licensee may file a request for a hearing withrespect to issuance of the amendment to the subject facility operatinglicense and any person whose interest may be affected by this proceedingand who wishes to participate as a party in the proceeding must file awritten petition for leave to intervene. Requests for a hearing and petitionsfor leave to intervene shall be filed in accordance with the Commission's``Rules of Practice for Domestic Licensing Proceedings'' in 10 CFR Part2. Interested persons should consult a current copy of 10 CFR 2.714 whichis available at the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC 20555 and at the Local Public DocumentRoom for the particular facility involved. If a request for a hearing orpetition for leave to intervene is filed by the above date, the Commissionor an Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, designated by the Commission orby the Chairman of the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board Panel, will ruleon the request and/or petition and the Secretary or the designated AtomicSafety and Licensing Board will issue a notice of hearing or an appropriateorder. As required by 10 CFR 2.714, a petition for leave to intervene shall setforth with particularity the interest of the petitioner in the proceeding,and how that interest may be affected by the results of the proceeding.The petition should specifically explain the reasons why intervention shouldbe permitted with particular reference to the following factors: (1) thenature of the petitioner's right under the Act to be made a party to theproceeding; (2) the nature and extent of the petitioner's property, financial,or other interest in the proceeding; and (3) the possible effect of anyorder which may be entered in the proceeding on the petitioner's interest.The petition should also identify the specific aspect(s) of the subjectmatter of the proceeding as to which petitioner wishes to intervene. Anyperson who has filed a petition for leave to intervene or who has beenadmitted as a party may amend the petition without requesting leave ofthe Board up to fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, but such an amended petition must satisfythe specificity requirements described above. Not later than fifteen (15) days prior to the first prehearing conferencescheduled in the proceeding, a petitioner shall file a supplement to thepetition to intervene which must include a list of the contentions whichare sought to be litigated in the matter. Each contention must consistof a specific statement of the issue of law or fact to be raised or controverted.In addition, the petitioner shall provide a brief explanation of the basesof the contention and a concise statement of the alleged facts or expertopinion which support the contention and on which the petitioner intendsto rely in proving the contention at the hearing. The petitioner must alsoprovide references to those specific sources and documents of which thepetitioner is aware and on which the petitioner intends to rely to establishthose facts or expert opinion. Petitioner must provide sufficient informationto show that a genuine dispute exists with the applicant on a materialissue of law or fact. Contentions shall be limited to matters within thescope of the amendments under consideration. The contention must be onewhich, if proven, would entitle the petitioner to relief. A petitionerwho fails to file such a supplement which satisfies these requirementswith respect to at least one contention will not be permitted to participateas a party. Those permitted to intervene become parties to the proceeding, subjectto any limitations in the order granting leave to intervene, and have theopportunity to participate fully in the conduct of the hearing, includingthe opportunity to present evidence and cross-examine witnesses. If a hearing is requested, the Commission will make a final determinationon the issue of no significant hazards consideration. The final determinationwill serve to decide when the hearing is held. If the final determination is that the amendment request involves no significanthazards consideration, the Commission may issue the amendment and makeit immediately effective, notwithstanding the request for a hearing. Anyhearing held would take place after issuance of the amendment. If the final determination is that the amendment involves a significanthazards consideration, any hearing held would take place before the issuanceof any amendment. Normally, the Commission will not issue the amendment until the expirationof the 30-day notice period. However, should circumstances change duringthe notice period such that failure to act in a timely way would result,for example, in derating or shutdown of the facility, the Commission mayissue the license amendment before the expiration of the 30-day noticeperiod, provided that its final determination is that the amendment involvesno significant hazards consideration. The final determination will considerall public and State comments received before action is taken. Should theCommission take this action, it will publish a notice of issuance and providefor opportunity for a hearing after issuance. The Commission expects thatthe need to take this action will occur very infrequently. A request for a hearing or a petition for leave to intervene must be filedwith the Secretary of the Commission, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, Attention: Docketing and Service Branch, or may bedelivered to the Commission's Public Document Room, the Gelman Building,2120 L Street, NW., Washington, DC, by the above date. Where petitionsare filed during the last ten (10) days of the notice period, it is requestedthat the petitioner promptly so inform the Commission by a toll-free telephonecall to Western Union at 1-(800) 325-6000 (in Missouri 1-(800) 342-6700).The Western Union operator should be given Datagram Identification Number3737 and the following message addressed to (<T3>Project Director</T3>): petitioner's name and telephone number; datepetition was mailed; plant name; and publication date and page number ofthis <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice. A copy of the petition should also besent to the Office of the General Counsel, U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission,Washington, DC 20555, and to the attorney for the licensee. Nontimely filings of petitions for leave to intervene, amended petitions,supplemental petitions and/or requests for hearing will not be entertainedabsent a determination by the Commission, the presiding officer or thepresiding Atomic Safety and Licensing Board, that the petition and/or requestshould be granted based upon a balancing of factors specified in 10 CFR2.714(a)(1)(i)-(v) and 2.714(d). For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment which is available for public inspection at the Commission'sPublic Document Room, the Gelman Building, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the local public document room for the particular facility involved.<ITAG tagnum="84">Duquesne Light Company, Docket Nos. 50-334 and 50-412, Beaver ValleyPower Station, Unit Nos. 1 and 2, Shippingport, Pennsylvania </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>January 12, 1989, revision dated August14, 1989. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>This is a renotice as a resultof the revised amendment request dated August 14, 1989. The original noticewas published on February 22, 1989 (54 FR 7634). The licensee's August 14, 1989 letter expanded the original request toinclude changes to Table 4.3-3 of the Technical Specifications. Specifically,the licensee proposed to add a footnote to the table to allow the surveillanceintervals of the containment radiation monitors be extended to the nextrefueling outage if the interval between refueling outages is greater than18 months. This change would obviate the need to perform a calibrationof the monitors when the plant is at power, and would thus eliminate thecircumstance under which both types of monitors (gaseous and particulate)are rendered inoperable due to calibration activities. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists in accordance with 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposedamendment to an operating license for a facility in accordance with theproposed amendment would not (1) involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated, (2) createthe possibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accidentpreviously evaluated, or (3) involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety. The proposed amendment to Table 4.3-3 only adds schedular flexibility tothe calibration schedule of the radiation monitors. There is no modificationto existing plant hardware nor operating procedures. The monitors themselvesdo not cause design basis accidents nor are they used to mitigate the consequencesof such accidents. Hence the answers to both questions (1) and (2) arenegative. There is furthermore no change in the assumptions or acceptancecriteria of any previous analysis; thus the answer to question (3) is alsonegative. The staff therefore proposes to determine that the requested amendmentinvolves no significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>B. F.

These recalculationsreflect the original plant design without modification. The proposed changesreflect increased doses, but remain substantially below the limits establishedin General Design Criterion (GDC) 19, Standard Review Plans (SRPs) 6.4and 15.7.5, and 10 CFR Part 100. There is no impact on environmental qualificationof equipment. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licenseehas reviewed the proposed changes and has determined the following: <ITAG tagnum="21">1) Effect on Probability and Consequences of an Accident: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed change concerns only recalculation of consequences ofpresently postulated accidents. No system or plant changes are involved.Therefore, there is no effect on the probability of an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes document revised analyses which determined increasedControl Room, TSC and offsite doses of postulated accidents. The ControlRoom and TSC doses remain below the regulatory limits established in GDC19 and SRP 6.4. Offsite doses for the affected accidents are minimallyaffected. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Occupational doses per 10 CFR 51.22 are unaffected. There is no impacton equipment qualification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">2) Effect on Possibility of a New or Different Kind of Accident: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">No plant modifications are involved. There is consequently no effecton the possibility of a new different accident. The changes to the HVAC[High Velocity Air Conditioning] FMEAS [Failure Mode Effects Analyses]are addressed by this revised dose analysis. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">3) Effect on Margin of Safety as Defined in Technical Specifications:</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Although the consequences of the accident have increased slightly,the affected systems (Control Room HVAC and FHB [Fuel Handling Building]HVAC system, Containment Spray and GWPS) still function within the boundsprescribed by the Technical Specifications. The revised analyses determinethe doses considering all appropriate parameters and single failures. Thereis no change in the basis of the Technical Specifications. Therefore, theTechnical Specification margins are maintained. </ITAG>Based on the previous discussion, the licensee concluded that the proposedamendment requests do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;nor involve a significant reduction in the required margin of safety. TheNRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationsdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis. The staff has, therefore,made a proposed determination that the licensee's request does not involvea significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Rooms Location: </T3>Wharton County Junior College,J.

A proposed amendmentto a operating license for a facility involves no significant hazards considerationif operation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendmentwould not (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof a accident previously evaluated, (2) create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated, or(3) involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety. Present TS require, in addition to ANSI/ANS 3.1-1978, licensed operatorsto meet or exceed the minimum qualifications of the supplemental requirementsspecified in Sections A and C of Enclosure 1 of the March 28, 1980, NRCletter to all licensees. TS also require the retraining and replacementtraining program to meet or exceed the minimum requirements of the abovecriteria as well as Appendix A of 10 CFR Part 55. In May 1987, the NRCincorporated Appendix A and the March 28, 1980, letter into 10 CFR Part55. Therefore, the proposed changes to TS reflect the current 10 CFR Part55 revision. The licensee has performed an evaluation as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes simply incorporate the proper references to 10CFR Part 55. The Technical Specification's intent remains intact. Therefore,the proposed change in no way increases the probability or consequencesof an accident. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">As stated above, this proposal causes no change in the intent of theexisting Technical Specifications. Therefore, the proposed change doesnot create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident fromany accident previously evaluated. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed changes incorporate the proper reference to 10 CFR Part55. Because the amended 10 CFR does not change the intent of the existingTechnical Specifications, the proposed change does not reduce any marginof safety. </ITAG>We have reviewed the licensee's evaluation and agree with the findings.Therefore, based on the above, the staff proposes to determine that theamendment does not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room Location: </T3>University of New OrleansLibrary, Louisiana Collection, Lakefront, New Orleans, Louisiana 70122<T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Bruce W.

This is as a consequence to responding to Licensing Event Reports87-003 and 87-014 which resulted from safety valve setpoint drifts in excessof that allowed by the Technical Specifications 2.1.6(1) and 2.1.6(3).Based on past experience and the NRC-approved reload licensing methodology,the Loss of Load and the Loss of Feedwater events were found to be themost limiting. Using the NRC-approved CESEC-III transient analysis codeand using the above events, the analysis of drifts of +3%/-2% did not exceedthe design basis acceptance criteria of 2750 psia and 1100 psia, respectively,as specified in the Updated Safety Analysis Report, Sections 14.9 and 14.10.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee provided an analysis that addressed the above three standardsin the amendment application as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The proposed amendment to the Technical Specifications does not involvea significant hazard consideration because the operation of the Fort CalhounStation in accordance with this amendment would not: </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Involve a significant increase in the probability of occurrenceor the consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment importantto safety previously evaluated in the safety analysis report. The proposedrevision to the allowable setpoint drifts was conservatively analyzed (CESEC-III).The results demonstrate that during a severe transient the peak reactorcoolant system pressure (RCS) and peak steam generator pressure would fallsignificantly below the Safety Limit and design basis acceptance criteriaof 2750 psia and 1100 psia, respectively, as specified in the Updated SafetyAnalysis Report Sections 14.9 and 14.10. Since the safety valves functionto control transient events, the revision of the allowable setpoint driftswould not increase the probability of occurrence of such events. Therefore,this amendment would not significantly increase the probability of occurrenceor consequences of an accident or malfunction of equipment important tosafety previously evaluated in the safety analysis report. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Create the possibility for an accident or malfunction of a differenttype than any evaluated previously in the safety analysis report. The safetyvalves function to control transient events. Analysis of the proposed allowablesetpoint drift using the NRC approved transient analysis methodology andcomputer code (CESEC-II) demonstrates that during the limiting overpressuretransients, peak RCS pressure and peak steam generator pressure would besignificantly below the design basis acceptance criteria of 2750 psia and1100 psia, respectively, as specified in the Updated Safety Analysis ReportSections 14.9 and 14.10. No new or different kind of accident is createdbecause actual operation of the plant remains unchanged. Therefore, thepossibility of an accident or malfunction of a different type than anyevaluated previously in the safety analysis report would not be created.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Involve a significant reduction in the margin of safety as definedin the basis for any Technical Specification. This revision only increasesthe allowable primary and secondary safety valve setpoint drift withinsafety limits as demonstrated using the NRC approved transient analysismethodology and computer code (CESEC-III). Therefore, the margin of safetyas defined in the basis for any Technical Specification is not reduced.</ITAG>The NRC staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.

Specifically, the following TS wouldbe deleted: 1. TS Table 2.2-1, ``Reactor Trip System Instrumentation Trip Setpoints,''Functional Unit 14, and associated Bases. 2. TS Table 3.3-1, ``Reactor Trip System Instrumentation,'' FunctionalUnit 14. 3. TS Table 3.3-2, ``Reactor Trip System Instrumentation Response Times,''Functional Unit 14. 4. TS Table 4.3-1, ``Reactor Trip System Instrumentation Surveillance Requirements,''Functional Unit 14. During the next refueling outages for Units 1 and 2, PGandamp;E plans toinstall a new digital feedwater control system as allowed by 10 CFR 50.59.The new system will include a steam generator level median signal selector(MSS) that selects the median of three steam generator narrow range signals.This improved design will enhance feedwater control performance and reliability.The installation of the MSS effectively eliminates the concern regardinga single random failure causing a control system action that results ina condition requiring protective action and preventing proper operationof a protection system demand designed to protect against this condition.Thus, the MSS will prevent interaction between the feedwater control andreactor protection systems in accordance with the requirements of IEEE279-1971. Removal of this interaction eliminates the need for the low feedwaterflow reactor trip. The MSS will functionally separate steam generator narrowrange level protection channels (low-low trip) to provide compliance withIEEE 279-1971 and satisfy the original design basis. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment will not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The licensee, in its submittal of September 19, 1989, evaluated the proposedchanges against the significant hazards criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 and againstthe Commission guidance concerning application of this standard. Basedon the evaluation given below, the licensee has concluded that the proposedchanges do not involve a significant hazards consideration.

The provisions of Specification4.0.2 are not applicable.'' <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3> 10 CFR 50.92 states that a proposed amendment will not involve asignificant hazards consideration if the proposed amendment does not: (i)Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated; or (ii) Create the possibility of a newor different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated; or(iii) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed amendment against the standardsof 10 CFR 50.92. The evaluation is summarized below. 1. This change does not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. The surveillance interval tolerance allowed in TTS 4.0.2 is unnecessaryand may conflict with TTS 3/4.6.1.2. Changing TTS 3/4.6.1.2 to make TTS4.0.2 not applicable does not change test frequency, test methods, or acceptancecriteria. Because current procedure will not be changed, this change doesnot involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. 2. This change does not create the possibility of a new or different kindof accident from any accident previously evaluated. As discussed above, the proposed change is administrative in nature anddoes not alter the test frequency, test methods, or acceptance criteria.The change is a clarification and is not related to creation of an accident.3. This change does not involve a significant reduction in a margin ofsafety. TTS 3/4.6.1.2 implements the requirements of 10 CFR Part 50, Appendix Jfor ``Integrated Leak Rate Test'' intervals. The change to TTS 3/4.6.1.2will eliminate the possible conflict between TTS 3/4.6.1.2 and TTS 4.0.2,and will bring TTS into conformance with the Westinghouse Standard TechnicalSpecifications. No change is proposed in the Integrated Leak Rate Test frequency, method,or acceptance criteria. The March 6, 1986 <T4>Federal Register </T4>(51 FR 7751) provided a list of examples of amendmentsthat are not likely to involve a significant hazards consideration. Oneexample from this list is: ``A purely administrative change to technicalspecifications, e.g., a change to achieve consistency throughout the technicalspecifications, correction of an error, or a change in nomenclature.''This change proposed herein is an administrative change. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards analysis andconcurs with the licensee's conclusions. As such, the staff proposes todetermine that the requested changes do not involve a significant hazardsconsideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Portland State UniversityLibrary, 731 S.W.

It proposes changes to this sectionconsistent with the licensee's plans to defuel the Fort St. Vrain (FSV)Reactor. These changes include a description of the dummy fuel blocks thatwill be used to maintain the reactor core's structural integrity. The boronloading in the dummy blocks and provisions for their cooling are also described.<T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licenseeprovided an analysis that addressed the above three standards in the amendmentapplication as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">The defueling elements are constructed similar to fuel elements. Thedefueling elements contain lumped poison pins (LPP's) that replace thenegative reactivity of the control rods. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Shutdown margin will be maintained during defueling in accordancewith Reactivity Technical Specification LCO 3.1.4, LCO 3.1.6, SR 4.1.4,and SR 4.1.6 similar to a refueling. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Safety Analysis Report, GA-C19694, analyzed the FSAR accidentscontained in Chapter 14 of the Fort St. Vrain FSAR for potential effectsof defueling. All accidents during defueling were determined to be boundedby current FSAR analysis or were no longer applicable. The analysis ofearthquake, reactivity accident, column deflection and misalignment, misplacedfuel element, blocking of coolant channel, electrical incidents, loss ofnormal shutdown cooling, moisture ingress, fuel storage accidents, andpermanent loss of forced circulation (DBA-1) were determined to be boundedby current analyses. Another five accidents, all involving loss of primarycoolant were determined to be no longer applicable. </ITAG>PSC has evaluated the proposed amendment request for significant hazardsconsideration using the standards in Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations,Part 50.92. The proposed amendment request involves no significant hazardsconsideration, since the proposed amendment would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. The reactor fuel elements will be replaced with defueling elements thatcontain boronated graphite and no fuel. The startup channels will continueto monitor core reactivity. The structural and thermal characteristicsof the reactor will remain unchanged. Procedures for removing the fuelelements will be maintained similar to a refueling. The insertion of thedefueling elements will also be similar to a refueling except that thedefueling elements will not contain fuel and control rods will not be reinstalled.Adequate shutdown margin will continue to be assured in accordance withReactivity Technical Specifications LCO 3.1.4, LCO 3.1.6, SR 4.1.4, andSR 4.1.6. The Safety Analysis Report, GA-C19694, analyzed the FSAR accidents containedin Chapter 14 of the Fort St. Vrain FSAR for potential effects of defueling.All accidents during defueling were determined to be bounded by currentFSAR analysis or were no longer applicable. The analyses of earthquake,reactivity accident, column deflection and misalignment, misplaced fuelelement, blocking of coolant channel, electrical incidents, loss of normalshutdown cooling, moisture ingress, fuel storage accidents, and permanentloss of forced circulation (DBA-1) were determined to bounded by currentanalyses. Another five accidents, all involving loss of primary coolantwere determined to be no longer applicable. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated. No significant change is being made to plant operation or safety systemoperation as described in Item 1. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. No significantchange is being made to refueling procedures (which will be used for defueling),core materials, reactivity monitoring systems, core structural design,or shutdown margin determinations as described in Item 1. Therefore, nosignificant change in any margin of safety is involved. Based on the above evaluation, it is concluded that operation (Defueling)of Fort St. Vrain in accordance with the proposed changes will involveno significant hazards consideration. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staffproposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Greeley Public Library, CityComplex Building, Greeley, Colorado <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>J.

The licenseeprovided an analysis that addressed the above three standards in the amendmentapplication as follows: <ITAG tagnum="21">In a letter dated August 8, 1989, the NRC has requested that PublicService Company of Colorado (PSC) submit these Technical Specificationamendments to the fuel handling and fuel storage sections of the Fort St.Vrain Technical Specifications. The fuel handling sections, for the mostpart, are only applicable while the reactor is shutdown. The fuel storagesections can be applicable more frequently. The handling of defueling elementsas described in the Fort St. Vrain Defueling Safety Analysis Report, GA-C19694submitted August 16, 1989, has been added to LCO 4.7.2. These changes havebeen stimulated by the Technical Specification Upgrade Program (TSUP),previously reviewed by the NRC, and by the Defueling Safety Analysis Report.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The Fort St. Vrain HTGR has 37 control rod pairs that enter the corefrom the top. For an accident such as loss of power the control rod drivemotors and brakes are deenergized and gravity causes the control rods tofall into the core. During fuel handling, the reactor is shutdown withmost of the control rods inserted. The Fuel Handling Machine is used toremove and insert fuel elements into the core during a refueling. The changesbeing included with this submittal include increased monitoring and surveillanceof the Fuel Handling Machine operation. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Other changes being included involve the cooling and monitoring ofspent fuel in storage wells. Each of the changes is addressed in the followingevaluation. </ITAG>PSC has evaluated the proposed amendment request for significant hazardsconsideration using the standards in Title 10, Code of Federal Regulations,Part 50.92. The proposed amendment request involves no significant hazards,since the proposed amendment would not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated. The revisions to Sections 4.7 and 5.7 of the Fort St. Vrain Technical Specificationscontained herein are being made to improve the specifications for maintainingsafety and ensuring proper surveillance of the plant safety systems. Section 2.26 is added to include a definition of Core Alterations. Section 2.30 is added to include a definition of Shutdown Margin. LCO 4.4.1 has been modified to add Note (u) to Page 4.4-7b under permissiblebypass conditions. This note identifies a condition where the startup channellow count rate rod withdrawal prohibit can be bypassed because the probabilityof the reactor going critical is very low. This condition is discussedin more detail in the Fort St. Vrain Defueling Safety Analysis Report,Section 3.1. LCO 4.5.2 is deleted as it is duplicated by the requirements of LCO 4.7.1.LCO 4.7.1 adds a clarification of atmospheric pressure as being less than1 psig, relocates the requirement for monitoring of neutron flux to LCO4.7.5, adds a requirement to maintain the shutdown margin requirementsof LCO 3.1.4, adds the Auxiliary Transfer Cask to the note, and adds anaction statement to close up the reactor before the core average inlettemperature reaches 400 degrees F. Each of these changes is a format changeor improves the specifications and safe operation of plant equipment. Theclarification of atmospheric pressure to be less than 1 psig maintainsthe reactor pressure well within the pressure ratings of the associatedequipment, reactor isolation valve (5 psig) and Fuel Handling Machine (5psig). Maintenance of the shutdown margin during fuel handling and maintenanceis a confirmation of that requirement from LCO 3.1.4. The addition of theAuxiliary Transfer Cask is included as it can be used in place of the FuelHandling Machine for reactor maintenance. The change of ``Specification3.1.3'' to ``LCO 3.1.4'' is made to agree with the new Reactivity TechnicalSpecifications. An applicability statement stating that applicability iswhenever both primary and secondary closures are open on any PCRV penetrationis unchanged from the TSUP LCO 3.9.1. The action statement is very similarto the current requirement of LCO 4.7.1. The insertion of a control roddrive and orifice assembly(ies) to close up the reactor before the coreaverage inlet temperature reaches 400 degrees F is designed to protectthe seal material of the reactor isolation valve(s). None of these changesinvolve a significant increase in the probability or consequences of anaccident previously evaluated. LCO 4.7.2 adds a clarification of atmospheric pressure, adds a requirementfor the gas waste system to be available, adds a requirement for an additionalcooling water coil to be operable or to have backup fire water connectionsand hose operable, adds a requirement to keep the reactor building craneattached to the Fuel Handling Machine except when the Fuel Handling Machineis bolted to a seismically qualified location, and adds a requirement tomaintain switches and alarms operable. An applicability statement has beenadded which is very similar to the current requirements of LCO 4.7.2 andincludes reactor internal maintenance. Action Item c. is modified to includethe option of unloading fuel to the Fuel Storage Casks. Action Item d.is new and adds reflector elements and defueling elements to the statement.Each of the changes made is either a format change or improves the specificationsand safe operation of the equipment and maintains TSUP analysis. Defuelingelements are described in the Fort St. Vrain Defueling Safety AnalysisReport, GA-C19694. The LCO 4.7.3 title has been changed to Fuel Storage Wells, a clarificationof atmospheric pressure is added, the requirement to have both coolingcoils operable is changed, the requirement for emergency cooling air flowis changed to 9000 cfm in accordance with FSAR section 14.6.3.2, a prohibitionfrom storing irradiated fuel in the central column of a fuel storage wellis added and two action statements to incorporate TSUP and FSAR section14.6.3.2 analyses are added. The Applicability Statement has been revisedfrom the TSUP to address the possibility that the stored fuel elementscan, at some time, maintain a temperature below 750 degrees F without theprovisions of this LCO. The Basis is revised to discuss the fact that thisLCO is only required to ensure that the fuel element surface temperaturesdo not exceed 750 degrees F. Each of the changes made is a format changeor is a change in accordance with FSAR and/or TSUP analyses. The prohibitionfrom storing irradiated fuel in the central column is addressed in FSARSection 14.6.3.2 and is a new addition to the Technical Specifications.LCO 4.7.4 and the Basis are identical to TSUP LCO 3.9.5 which has previouslybeen reviewed by the NRC. LCO 4.7.5 adds the requirements for monitoring the core reactivity thatwere formerly included in LCO 4.7.1 and adds action statements that requirethe startup channels to be operable. A provision has been added that whenall control rods have been withdrawn without resulting in reactor criticality,as determined with a calculated k(eff) not to exceed 0.95 assuming allconditions specified in SR 4.1.4, the startup channel low count rate rodwithdrawal prohibit can be bypassed. These provisions are in agreementwith the Defueling Safety Analysis Report, Section 3.1. LCO 4.7.6 is a new LCO addressing the maintenance of two-way communicationsbetween the Control Room and the refueling deck. It maintains the TSUPanalyses and format intact. It also includes an applicability statementand an associated surveillance requirement reference. These additionalrequirements are considered an enhancement to the Technical Specifications.SR 5.7.1 changes the current SR 5.7.1 with surveillances every 12 monthsinstead of prior to use and every refueling period. The surveillance requirementsof SR 5.7.1 are very similar to TSUP SR 4.9.3 except that some editorialchanges are made and the frequency of item c., reactor building crane inspection,has been changed from every 14 days to every 31 days because movement ofthe reactor building crane is very infrequent. The 31 day interval, inaddition to other preventive maintenance inspections required by ANSI B.30.2,adequately assures that the crane will perform properly. This surveillanceis an enhancement of the current SR 5.7.1. SR 5.7.2 changed title of Surveillance from ``Fuel Storage Facility'' to``Fuel Storage Wells''. This Specification is substantially revamped toincorporated the TSUP and FSAR Section 14.6.3.2 analyses. It also envelopesthe current Technical Specification analysis. It includes an associatedLCO statement. It replaces ``once per REFUELING CYCLE'' in item c. of theTSUP with ``once per 18 months''. Refueling Cycle is defined as 18 months.This surveillance is an enhancement of the current SR 5.7.2. SR 5.7.3 is a new surveillance for the Technical Specifications and addsverification of reactor pressure and temperature every 12 hours. This surveillanceand basis are identical to TSUP SR 4.9.1. These are new surveillance requirementsand enhance the Technical Specifications. SR 5.7.4 is a new SR added to provide surveillance requirements not includedin the current Technical Specifications for the Spent Fuel Shipping Cask.SR 5.7.4 and the Basis are identical to TSUP SR 4.9.5. SR 5.7.5 is a new specification for the current Technical Specifications.The new SR 5.7.5 is very similar to TSUP 4.9.2. The Basis is revised toadd reference to the condition where subcriticality has been demonstratedwith all control rods withdrawn and with a calculated k(eff) not greaterthan 0.95. This surveillance is new to the Technical Specifications, supplements therequirements of SR 5.4.1, and is considered an enhancement to the TechnicalSpecifications. The permissible bypass conditions of the startup channellow count rate rod withdrawal prohibit are addressed by the LCO 4.4.1 andLCO 4.7.5. SR 5.7.6 is a new SR added to provide surveillance requirements for thenew Communications During Core Alterations LCO (LCO 4.7.6). It also includesan associated LCO statement. It incorporates the TSUP analysis and is anenhancement to the Technical Specifications. These changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated. 2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated. As described in item 1, no change is being made to plant operation or safetysystems that has not been previously analyzed in the FSAR, TSUP analyses,or the Defueling Safety Analysis Report, GA-C19694. 3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. No margins of safety are being affected other than those already analyzedin the FSAR or Defueling Safety Analysis Report, GA-C19694. The changesmade are format and other changs which will better implement the conditionsspecified by the FSAR and Defueling Safety Analysis Report, GA-C19694.Based on the above evaluation, it is concluded that operation of Fort St.Vrain, in accordance with the proposed changes, will involve no significanthazards consideration. PSC considers the proposed changes to be an improvementin the overall plant reliability and documentation as the new limitingconditions for operation and surveillances are designed to improve fuelhandling and storage performance. The majority of these changes have beenpreviously reviewed by the NRC during the TSUP review process. Other changeshave been presented in the Fort St. Vrain Defueling Safety Analysis Report,GA-C19694. The staff has reviewed the licensee's no significant hazards considerationdetermination. Based on the review and the above discussions, the staffproposes to determine that the proposed changes do not involve significanthazards considerations. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Greeley Public Library, CityComplex Building, Greeley, Colorado <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>J.

New Applicability LCO3.0.5 references current LCO 4.0.4 for CALCULATED BULK CORE TEMPERATURE.Applicability Specifications 4.0.1, 4.0.3, 4.0.4, and their Bases are aduplication of the same TSUP Specifications except for editorializing thereference to Specification 4.0.2. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">The 3.25 limit was removed from SR 4.0.2. This will provide greaterflexibility, reduce the administrative burden associated with the use ofthis provision, and have an overall positive effect on safety. As statedin Generic Letter 89-14, `This alternative to the requirements of Specification4.0.2 will remove an unnecessary restriction on extending surveillancerequirements and will result in a benefit to safety when plant conditionsare not conducive to the safe conduct of surveillance requirements'. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">New Specification 3/4.1.1 replaces Interim Specification 3/4.1.1 andis derived from TSUP Specification 3/4.1.1.

Variations between the TSUPspecification and this proposal are editorial in nature and clarify controlrod requirements ``in fueled regions,'' and do not affect the technicalcontent. A defueled region does not require the negative reactivity ofa control rod pair to maintain the SHUTDOWN MARGIN because without fuel,the region has no positive reactivity. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">New Specification 3/4.1.4 replaces Interim Specification 3/4.1.4 andis derived from TSUP Specification 3/4.1.3. As stated in the Basis, thepurpose of this specification is to ensure that during Shutdown and Refueling,a sufficient number of control rod pairs are fully inserted into fueledregions to keep the reactor in a shutdown condition. The revision to SR4.1.4 (during Refueling) that will delete the requirement to assess theShutdown Margin after all control rod pairs have been withdrawn withoutresulting in reactor criticality, still meets the expressed purpose ofthis Specification. K(eff) must be calculated assuming the same conditionsas during Shutdown Margin assessment except that all control rod pairsshall be assumed withdrawn, and k(eff) must not exceed 0.95 for this revisionto become operative. Other variations between the TSUP specification andthis proposal are editorial in nature and clarify control rod requirements``in fueled regions,'' and do not affect the technical content, as describedabove in the discussion on 3/4.1.3. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">New Specification 3/4.1.5 replaces Interim Specification 3/4.1.5 andis derived from TSUP Specification 3/4.1.4.1. Variations between the TSUPspecification and this proposal are mostly editorial in nature. The exceptionto the requirements of TSUP Specification 3/4.1.4.1 during power operationfor Xenon Stability Physics Tests, was not included in Specification 3/4.1.5since this testing will not be done during the remaining time Fort St.Vrain maintains an operating license. This does not degrade the technicalaspect of this specification. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">New Specification 3/4.1.6 replaces Interim Specification 3/4.1.6 andis derived from TSUP Specification 3/4.1.4.2. As stated in the Basis, thepurpose of this specification is to ensure that during Shutdown and Refueling,a sufficient number of control rod pairs are fully inserted into fueledregions to keep the reactor in a shutdown condition. When all control rodpairs have been withdrawn without resulting in reactor criticality, theintent of this specification will be met. See additional discussion inthe write-up for Specification 3/4.1.4, above. The added discussion tothe Basis on how to make rod pairs incapable of being withdrawn promotesbetter technical understanding and does not affect the intent or mechanismof this Specification. Other variations between the TSUP specificationand this proposal are editorial in nature and clarify control rod requirements``in fueled regions,'' and do not affect the technical content, as describedabove in the discussion on 3/4.1.3. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">New Specification 3/4.1.7 replaces Interim Specification 3/4.1.7 andis derived from TSUP Specification 3/4.1.5.

Summer Nuclear Station, Unit No.1, Fairfield County, South Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>July 21, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The proposed amendments to Table2.2-1 of Technical Specification Section 2.2.1, ``Reactor Trip System InstrumentationSetpoints,'' and Table 3.3-4 of Technical Specification Section 3.3.2,``Engineered Safety Feature Actuation System Instrumentation,'' reflectsrevised instrumentation setpoints associated with the removal and replacementof the existing resistance temperature detector (RTD) bypass manifold systemwith fast response RTDs located in the reactor coolant hot and cold legpiping. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a nosignificant hazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c).A proposed amendment to an operating license involves no significant hazardsconsideration if operation of the facility in accordance with the proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; or (2) Create thepossibility of a new or different kind of accident from any accident previouslyevaluated; or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.The original RTD bypass system utilized an arrangement which directs asample of the Reactor Coolant System (RCS) flow from the main coolant pipingto an independent temperature measurement manifold. Coolant is redirectedby scoops from the hot leg at three locations, 120 degrees apart in thesame plane around the pipe circumference, in order to obtain a representativesample. A cold leg sample is also taken, at the discharge of the reactorcoolant pump, which provides sufficient mixing so that multiple samplingis not necessary. After temperature measurement, the sample is then returnedto the main coolant flow. The narrow range RTDs provide the temperatureto calculate loop delta-T and T<T2>ave</T2>. In order to eliminate operating obstacles associated withthe bypass system (such as leakage through valves and flanges and radiationexposure during reactor building maintenance), South Carolina Electricandamp; Gas Company (SCEandamp;G) is proposing to install a fast response systemwhich measures loop temperature via thermowell mounted RTDs protrudinginto the main reactor coolant flow thereby eliminating the bypass pipingnetwork. The licensee has evaluated the proposed changes against the significanthazards criteria of 10 CFR 50.92 and has determined that, if implemented,the proposed changes do not involve any significant hazards considerationas described below: 1. The probability or consequences of an accident previously evaluatedis not significantly increased. The loss-of-coolant accident (LOCA) andnon-LOCA accident analyses were reviewed verifying that the variationsin uncertainty associated with certain reactor trip functions, reflectedin the Technical Specification changes, do not invalidate the current ReloadTransition Safety Report (RTSR) analyses of record. Therefore, the designbasis conclusions are still met. Additionally, it was determined that sufficientallowance exists in the current RTSR assumptions such that the total temperaturemeasurement uncertainly and protection system response time for the newRTDs do not impact the RTSR results. With respect to a LOCA, conservativenominal input values were assumed in the analysis and not plant specificinput valves; therefore, slight variation in uncertainties do not affectthe RTSR results. These conclusions are based upon calculations supportingthe revised Tables 2.2-1 and 3.3-4 provided in the attached WCAP-12189.The new values were obtained using methodology consistent with the WestinghouseSetpoint Methodology for Protection System, WCAP-11770, which was previouslysubmitted to the Commission. 2. The possibility for an accident or malfunction of a different type thanany evaluated previously in the safety analysis reports is not created.At V.C. Summer Nuclear Station, the three hot leg RTDs and one cold legRTD will utilize the existing penetrations into the RCS piping from thebypass system with only slight modifications. Caps and welds sealing thecrossover leg bypass return piping nozzle, as well as the modificationand welding for the existing penetation, will be qualified in accordancewith the ASME Code consistent with current plant designs. Considerationhas been given to plant response in the remote possibility that a thermowellwould be ejected from its boss. It has been concluded that the affect ofthis flow area is insignificant on the results of the large break LOCAanalyses and bounded by the results for the small break LOCA analyses.Therefore, the possibility of a new or different kind of accident doesnot exist. The function of the delta-T/T<T2>ave</T2> protection channels is not changed because of the bypass elimination.The newly installed fast response RTDs perform the same function in bothT<T2>hot</T2> and T<T2>cold</T2> applications. The three T<T2>hot</T2> signals are electronically averaged, with the capability tomanually add an electronic bias to a two-RTD average should one RTD fail.These measured temperature values will still serve as input to two-out-of-threevoting logic for protection functions. Spare RTDs are installed and canbe manually activated should the on-line RTD fail. The basis for the instrumentationand control design meets the criteria of applicable IEEE standards, regulatoryguides and general design criteria which satisfy electrical separation,seismic and environmental qualification and single failure criteria. 3. The margin of safety as defined in the basis of the Technical Specificationsis not significantly reduced by the affect of the change of the responsetime and setpoint uncertainties. The investigation of the affect of thesevariables on non-LOCA and LOCA transients has verified that plant operationwill be maintained within the bounds of safe, analyzed conditions as definedin the RTSR with the revised Technical Specifications. Conclusions presentedin the RTSR remain valid. The specific analyses and supporting calculationssupporting these conclusions are provided in the attached WCAP-12189. Assuch, no reduction in the margin of safety between the RTSR acceptancelimit and the ultimiate safety limit (such as departure from nucleate boilingratio) has taken place for operation with the new RTD system. The licensee has concluded that the proposed amendment meets the threestandards in 10 CFR 50.92 and, therefore, involves no significant hazardsconsideration. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's no significanthazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendmentdoes not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Fairfield County Library,Garden and Washington Streets, Winnsboro, South Carolina 29180 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Randolph R.

Removalof the RHR ACI addresses utility and Commission concerns regarding thepotential for failure of the ACI circuitry to cause inadvertent isolationof the RHR system with subsequent loss of RHR capability during cold shutdownand refueling operations. The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a no significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration ifoperation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety.

Mahan, South Carolina Electricand Gas Company, P.O. Box 764, Columbia, South Carolina 29218 <T3>NRC Project Director: </T3>Elinor G. Adensam <ITAG tagnum="84">South Carolina Electric andamp; Gas Company, South Carolina Public ServiceAuthority, Docket No. 50-395, Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station, Unit No.1, Fairfield County, South Carolina </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>July 24, 1989 <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The purpose of this submittalis to present the justification for extending application of the F* criterionin the Virgil C. Summer Nuclear Station (VCSNS) Technical Specification3/4.4.5, Steam Generators. Current authorization apply to the F* criterionexpires at the end of the fifth fuel cycle which is scheduled to occurin the spring of 1990. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The F* criterion was developed to allow steam generator tubes to remainin service when degradation has been detected in the full depth hard rollexpanded portion of the tube in the tube sheet below the F distance (1.6'').If the F* criterion were not in use for VCSNS, defects below the F* distancewould require the affected tubes to be plugged. Based on technical considerations,such plugging is not necessary. The presence of the tube sheet constrainsthe tube and compliments its integrity in the hard rolled region by precludingtube deformation beyond its expanded outside diameter. The resistance toboth tube rupture and tube collapse is significantly strengthened by thetube sheet. In addition, the intimate contact between the tube and thetube sheet effects the leak behavior of any potential throughout tube cracksin this region, i.e., no significant leakage relative to plant technicalspecification allowables has been experience. The technical basis for establishing the F* criterion has been presentedpreviously in Westinghouse Reports WCAP-11228 (proprietary) and WCAP-11229(non-proprietary). The F* criterion identifies a distance below the faceof the tube sheet or the top of the last hardroll, whichever is furtherin the tubesheet, and designates that distance F*. Below F*, tube degradationof any extend does not necessitate plugging. To date, the F* criterionhas been utilized during both the third and fourth refueling outages atVCSNS. The information presented by the licensee provided their justificationfor continuing the application of the F* criterion for the remaining lifeof the steam generators. The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a no significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92(c). A proposed amendmentto an operating license involves no significant hazards consideration ifoperation of the facility in accordance with the proposed amendment wouldnot: (1) involve a significant increase in the probability or consequencesof an accident previously evaluated; or (2) create the possibility of anew or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The licensee has evaluated the proposed changes against the significanthazards criterion of 10 CFR 50.92 and determined that: 1) The proposed amendment would not involve a significant increase in theprobability or consequences of an accident previously evaluated. As previously documented, the utilization of the F* criterion does notnot impact the operability of the steam generator. The restraining actionof the tubesheet upon the tubes precludes tube rupture or collapse forF* tubes, and the tube to tubesheet interface restricts the potential forprimary to secondary leakage. The prevention of tube rupture by the tubesheet assures the probabilityof this accident is unaffected, while the restriction of leakage assuresthat the consequences of any accident are not significantly affected bythe application of F*. 2) The proposed amendment would not create the possibility of a new ordifferent kind of accident previously evaluated. The proposed changes continue to ensure the integrity of the steam generatortubes and the tubesheet. With the integrity of the steam generator maintained,no new accident scenarios are created. 3) The proposed amendment would not involve a significant reduction ina margin of safety. The proposed changes extend the use of the F* criterion for the life ofthe steam generator. Testing and operational experience have revealed thatthe affected tubes behave as expected, i.e, remain restrained by the tubesheetwith no significant leakage, and do not present a safety concern. Additionally, the NRC has previously found the F* criterion to be acceptableat VCSNS, pending confirmation of tube behavior through two cycles of operation.Documentation to date supports the behavior of F* tubes has been as expected.Proper application of the F* criterion has been demonstrated to not havean adverse effect on the integrity of the generators, thus the F* criterionmay be extended for the life of the steam generators without decreasingplant safety. In addition, the grammatical restructuring of the F* definition is purelyadministrative in nature and has no technical impact. Based upon the precedinganalysis, the licensee concluded, in accordance with 10 CFR 50.91, thatthe proposed change warrants a no significant hazards determination asdefined by 10 CFR 50.92. The NRC staff has made a preliminary review of the licensee's no significanthazards consideration determination and agrees with the licensee's analysis.Accordingly, the Commission proposes to determine that the requested amendmentdoes not involve a significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Fairfield County Library,Garden and Washington Streets, Winnsboro, South Carolina 29180 <T3>Attorney for licensee: </T3>Randolph R.

Adensam <ITAG tagnum="84">Washington Public Power Supply System, Docket No. 50-397, NuclearProject No. 2, Benton County, Washington </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>June 23, 1989. <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The licensee has requested thatTechnical Specification Tables 3.3.7.5-1, Accident Monitoring Instrumentation,and 4.3.7.5-1, Accident Monitoring Instrumentation Surveillance Requirements,be modified by removing reference to instrument number 24, Post-AccidentSampling Containment Atmosphere Radiation Monitor, and to instrument number29, Post Accident Sampling Primary Coolant Radiation Monitor. Under theexisting technical specification these two instruments must meet specifiedoperability requirements which must be demonstrated by periodic surveillances.Under the proposed amendment the operability of these two instruments wouldnot be required by the technical specifications. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The function of the post accident sampling system (PASS) is to providea method for evaluating the extent of core degradation as required by TMIaction item II.B.3. The basis for the Accident Monitoring Instrumentationtechnical specification is to ensure that sufficient information is availableon selected plant parameters to monitor and assess important variablesfollowing an accident. The two instruments proposed for removal from thetechnical specifications do not provide data for evaluating the extentof core degradation nor for monitoring and assessing the important variables.The two instruments were included in the plant design to give techniciansan indication of contamination levels to enhance safety in the collectionof samples. Since these instruments are not the source of the data forthe evaluation of accident conditions, the licensee believes that theseinstruments should be removed from the Technical Specifications. The licensee does not intend to remove these instruments from service.They will be maintained as are other non-safety related instrumentation.The instruments are part of the PASS which is a function required by theProcedures and Programs section 6.8.4.c in the Administrative Controlssection of the WNP-2 Technical Specifications. However, the licensee believesthat their operability should not be held to the same standard as the instrumentsretained in the technical specifications since inoperable status of thetwo devices would not impair the capability of the licensee to monitorand assess plant conditions following an accident. The licensee has noted that there is additional monitoring equipment whichis used to minimize exposure of personnel during sampling activities. The licensee has determined that the proposed amendment does not representa significant hazard because it does not: 1. Involve a significant increase in the probability or consequences ofan accident previously evaluated because, as discussed above, the instrumentsdo not provide input to plant actions during or following an accident.As such the removal of these instruments from the Technical Specificationswill not affect the plant accident response capabilities. Hence, no increasein the consequences of an accident previously evaluated is considered credible.The PASS and the subject instruments are used post accident but do notprovide an automatic mitigation function. The proposed change can thereforenot influence the probability of occurrence of an accident previously evaluated.2. Create the possibility of a new or different kind of accident from anyaccident previously evaluated because the unavailability of the instrumentationwill not prevent the PASS from performing its design function. Additionallythe proposed change does not represent a change to plant design. Henceno new different accident possibilities are introduced with this change.3. Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety because as discussedabove the subject instruments do not contribute to the functional basesof the PASS and serve no significant function during post accident conditions.Hence no safety margins are reduced by removing them from the TechnicalSpecifications. The staff is in agreement with the licensee's evaluation. Accordingly,the Commission proposes to determine that these changes do not involvea significant hazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Richland City Library, Swiftand Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington 99352. <T3>Attorneys for licensees: </T3>Nicholas S.

Knighton <ITAG tagnum="84">Washington Public Power Supply System, Docket No. 50-397, NuclearProject No. 2, Benton County, Washington </ITAG><T3>Date of amendment request: </T3>September 14, 1989 (two letters). <T3>Description of amendment request: </T3>The Washington Public PowerSupply System (the licensee) has applied for an amendment to TechnicalSpecification 3/4.3.1 ``Reactor Protection System Instrumentation'' andsupporting basis. Specifically it is proposed that channel functional testfrequencies for eleven instrument channels specified in Table 4.3.1.1-1,``Reactor Protection System Instrumentation Surveillance Requirements,''be changed from their current interval to a quarterly interval. The functionalunits affected and the current channel functional test frequency are: Averagepower range monitor, flow biased simulated thermal power - upscale, weekly;Average power range monitor, fixed neutron flux - upscale, weekly; Averagepower range monitor, inoperative, weekly; Reactor vessel steam dome pressure- high, monthly; Reactor vessel water level - low, level 3, monthly; Mainsteam line isolation valve - closure, monthly; Main steam line radiation- high, monthly; Primary containment pressure - high, monthly; Scram dischargevolume water level - high, level transmitter, monthly; Turbine throttlevalve - closure, monthly, and; Turbine governor valve fast closure valvetrip system oil pressure - low, monthly. Additionally, the frequency ofthe channel functional test for the manual scram would be increased frommonthly to weekly. The licensee has also proposed to increase the response times for all reactorprotection system instrument channels. Currently the licensee must placea trip system for an inoperable channel in the tripped condition withinone hour. It is proposed that this time be increased to twelve hours. Ifthe inoperable channel can be restored to an operable status within twohours, the licensee currently is excused from placing the channel in thetripped condition when such action would cause the trip function to occur.The proposed amendment would increase this time to return the channel tooperability to six hours. The licensee would also amend Bases Section 3/4.3.1 to include the basisfor the specified surveillance intervals. The current technical specifications allow a channel to be placed in aninoperable status for up to two hours for required surveillance withoutplacing the trip system in the tripped condition provided that at leastone operable channel in the same trip system is monitoring that parameter.The licensee has proposed that this time allowed for surveillance be increasedto six hours. <T3>Basis for proposed no significant hazards consideration determination:</T3>The Commission has provided standards for determining whether a significanthazards consideration exists as stated in 10 CFR 50.92. A proposed amendmentto an operating license for a facility involves no significant hazardsconsiderations if operation of the facility in accordance with a proposedamendment would not: (1) Involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated; (2) Create the possibilityof a new or different kind of accident from any accident previously evaluated;or (3) Involve a significant reduction in a margin of safety. The changes would incorporate reactor protection system (RPS) surveillancefrequencies and outage times established by the Boiling Water Reactor OwnersGroup as meeting the recommendations of NRC Generic Letter 83-28, Item4.5.3. The proposed changes optimize surveillance intervals for improvedRPS reliability and increase allowable outage times (AOTs). The ownersgroup study showed that the increase in AOTs has negligible impact on RPSfailure frequency yet allows more time for repair and decreases the potentialfor unnecessary plant shutdown. The licensee has determined that the proposed amendment does not representa significant hazard consideration because: 1. The proposed changes do not involve a significant increase in the probabilityor consequences of an accident previously evaluated because the changeshave been shown to have insignificant impact to overall RPS failure ratesand operability. As shown by NEDC 30851P [``Technical Specification ImprovementAnalyses for BWR Reactor Protection System''] and the corresponding plantspecific analyses, the changes do not degrade the reliability of the RPS.Hence the probability or consequences of previously evaluated accidentsare not significantly increased due to this change. To the contrary asstated in section 5.7.4 [of NEDC 30851P] the changes represent a decreasein core damage frequency. 2. The proposed changes do not create the possibility of a new or differentkind of accident from any accident previously evaluated because RPS functionand reliability are not degraded by these changes. No new modes of plantoperation are introduced with these changes. No new or different kind ofaccident is credible. 3. The proposed changes do not involve a significant reduction in a marginof safety because as shown in Reference 1) and GE report MDE-88-0485 (Reference5) and found acceptable by the Staff in Reference 2) the changes representan overall decrease in core melt frequency. As such the margin of safetyis enhanced by the proposed changes. The staff is in agreement with the licensee's evaluation. Accordingly theCommission proposes to determine that these changes do not involve a significanthazards consideration. <T3>Local Public Document Room location: </T3>Richland City Library, Swiftand Northgate Streets, Richland, Washington 99352. <T3>Attorneys for licensees: </T3>Nicholas S.
