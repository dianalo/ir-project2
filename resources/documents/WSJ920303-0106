Starting in New Hampshire, the presidential candidateshave circled each other warily, picking their opportunitiesand trying to survive to the next round. But the period ofregional struggles and split decisions is about to end, andthe real battle for the nomination -- bloody, perhapsconclusive, almost surely entailing some political fatalities-- is about to occur.</LP><TEXT>   This showdown is all but certain to take place in the weekleading to the twin March 17 primaries in Illinois and inMichigan. &quot;We have to have it out somewhere,&quot; says formerSen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, winner of the NewHampshire Primary.   The character of this encounter, of course, won't be fullydetermined until results are known from today's primaries inGeorgia, Maryland and Colorado and from the 11 states thathold primaries and caucuses on Super Tuesday, a week fromtoday. But the likely consequences of the Midwesternconfrontation are clear already: Once it's completed, therewill probably be only two candidates in the field with aserious shot at the nomination.   &quot;When the calendar was constructed this year, that daybecame a focal point and perhaps the greatest showdown of thecampaign,&quot; says Thomas Devine, campaign manager for Sen. BobKerrey of Nebraska.   In a political season where candidates have had or areexpected to have strong regional showings -- Mr. Tsongas wonin New Hampshire, Mr. Kerrey in South Dakota, native son Sen.Tom Harkin in Iowa, and Gov. Bill Clinton is expected todominate the South -- this is the first major contest wherethere is no candidate competing on home turf.   &quot;The absence of a `home team' candidate makes for a fairlyeven playing field, finally giving definition to the race,&quot;says Michael Binford, a political scientist at Georgia StateUniversity. &quot;The voters will finally have had time to have asense of the candidates, and this will be the firstmeaningful test without the underbrush of minor candidates.&quot;   This confrontation, moreover, occurs on one of thetraditional battlegrounds of U.S. politics, the industrialheartland, and the stakes are higher than usual because thediverse region suffers from many of the problems that plaguethe U.S. economy: the crisis in manufacturing, the challengein international trade and the economic distress being feltby the middle class. Illinois and Michigan, moreover, arelikely to be swing states in the general election inNovember. &quot;These are places you prove you can win the generalelection,&quot; says Mr. Devine.   And while commentators and analysts are focusing on theSouthern primaries, it is the Midwestern primaries thatalready are dominating the energies of the strategists insidethe campaigns. The Clinton forces in New York, which holds animportant primary next month, haven't been able to mobilizebecause the campaign's Little Rock, Ark., headquarters haspostponed funding and tactical decisions until after theIllinois and Michigan primaries; Clinton supporters who wantto approach some of New York's variegated constituencies withissues papers have been told to wait until after themid-March confrontation. Mr. Kerrey's strategists havealready scheduled the candidate to spend the day of SuperTuesday itself in Michigan.   Financial factors add pressure for a defining clash. Thecandidates are experiencing major cash-flow troubles already,and their treasuries are likely to be even leaner after SuperTuesday.   The Midwestern primaries may be the last opportunity tostop Gov. Clinton, who has the best organization and the mostmoney, or, if Mr. Clinton falters in the South next week, itcould be the place where the new campaign takes shape.   &quot;This could be the arena for Clinton to put the nominationaway,&quot; says David Rohde, a University of Michigan politicalscientist. &quot;In that case, he'll have to come up here and makehis economic pitch, a fairly free-trade message that leavesroom for someone like Kerrey to make a more protectionistpitch. So there could be a real economic battle here.&quot;   Right now Gov. Clinton holds an advantage in Illinois inthat many of his top aides are well-connected politicalinsiders here, but that advantage is not insurmountable. Thepresidential race is far less formed in Michigan, where highunemployment, economic uneasiness and resentment over foreigntrade practices make the state a breeding ground for afractious political battle.   &quot;There's no mystery about what the issue will be. They'regoing to have to talk about industrial decline,&quot; says Rep.Sander Levin of Michigan, who hasn't endorsed any of theDemocratic contenders yet. &quot;It won't be a about a singleindustry, but about the broader issue of where America hasbeen going industrially. It's damn good for the confrontationto be here because we have to confront these issues and domore than talk in slogans.&quot;   The political vacuum in Michigan is attractive because thecandidates who want to gain an advantage might be drawn thererather than Illinois, where Mr. Clinton has his strength.Strategists for Mr. Kerrey even toyed with divertingfinancial resources to Michigan from the costly Super Tuesdaycontests, gambling that an early presence in the state wouldenhance their prospects.   But the chance to ambush Mr. Clinton in Illinois, using amessage that could also generate support in Michigan, may beas enticing. Political professionals know there isn't anyplace in the country like Chicago for creating a media frenzywithout spending much, if any, money; former Vice PresidentWalter Mondale, for example, was able to take advantage ofmiscues by Sen. Gary Hart and move up 19 percentage points infive days in Illinois in 1984, overtaking the Coloradan andputting himself in position to capture the nomination.   This time, of course, running in Illinois means runninginto Mr. Clinton's strength, which holds appeal for Mr.Tsongas at least and perhaps for Mr. Kerrey as well.   &quot;The odds are against us in Illinois, so in some respectsthat's more of an incentive,&quot; Mr. Tsongas said last weekafter examining the political landscape here in Illinois.&quot;Part of the appeal of our campaign is that we're notafraid.&quot;   The Clinton camp clearly would like to have theconfrontation here. George Stephanopoulos, his deputycampaign manager, says that both states are &quot;very important,&quot;but acknowledges that Mr. Clinton has concentrated onIllinois. &quot;If you can play in Illinois, you can play acrossthe country,&quot; he says. &quot;Whoever wins in Illinois is thepresumptive favorite for the nomination.&quot;   The enthusiasm of many of the Clinton people in Illinoisappears extremely thin, though there is little enthusiasm foranyone else, either.   &quot;Clinton rode through the state and picked up most of theDemocratic establishment,&quot; says Rep. Richard Durbin ofIllinois, who is supporting Sen. Kerrey. &quot;But there's stilluncertainty about his candidacy.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
