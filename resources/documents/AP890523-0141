We have the finestcomputer science. Our problem is a single problem _ we can'tmanufacture worth a damn,'' said . Gordon Bell, vice president ofresearch and development at Ardent Computer Corp., Sunnyvale, Calif.   Gordon E. Moore, board chairman of Intel Corp., this country'sleading manufacturer of computer microprocessors, said he hopesU.S. companies will respond to a recent call by the SemiconductorIndustry Association to re-enter the world market for computermemory chips.   Japan now controls 90 percent of the market for dynamicrandom-access memory chips, known as DRAMs.   Moore said such an effort to resuscitate U.S. production ofDRAMS probably would have to be a joint undertaking. ``I'm hopefulwe can find 10 companies ... who are each willing to put up $50million to $70 million in capital,'' he said.   Bell and Moore were among speakers at a colloquium sponsored bythe National Research Council, the principal operating agency ofthe National Academies of Sciences and Engineering.   Robert W. Lucky, executive director of the communicationssciences research division at ATandamp;T Bell Laboratories, noted that in1988 U.S. companies controlled 57 percent of the $120 billion worldcomputer market, while the Japanese had a 41 percent share.   However, the United States had a very small share in themanufacturing of many computer components, including 1 percent ofDRAMs and 3 percent of liquid crystal displays.   Patrick A. Toole, senior vice president and general manager oftechnology products for IBM Corp., said there was a need for ``muchimproved manufacturing prowess'' in the U.S. computer industry.   Building on the example of Sematech, an American consortium forresearch and development of semiconductors, ``together we must findways to charter new consortia, particularly in manufacturing,''Toole said.   Charles H. Ferguson, a research associate with the Center forTechnology, Policy and Industrial Development at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology, said that ``to a very great degree theUnited States arena functions as a kind of public serviceorganization for the rest of the world computer industry.''   ``United States firms do a lot of the innovation but do notcapture the market when the transition is made to massproduction,'' he said.   Ferguson called for steps by the federal government includingmaking the research and development tax credit permanent and othertax law changes to help reduce the cost of capital for U.S.companies.   Also, he said there was a need for ``an increase in the level oftechnical and strategic cooperation'' among American computer firmsas well as the development of a nationwide fiber optic network forcomputer communications.   ``To do these things effectively is going to require afundamental break with the way the U.S. government does things andthe way the private sector does things,'' Ferguson said.</TEXT></DOC>
