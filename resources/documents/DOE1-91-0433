Theapplication of geothermal energy in the sector of greenhouse air conditioningis a specific sector, but an important one both from the energetic andeconomical points of view. The contact points between the characteristicsof geothermics and the requirements of greenhouse cultures are closelyexamined, by taking into consideration some combination hypotheses. Someaspects connected with the planning approach are dealt with to analyzethe elements for optimization. A survey is given of technical installationsused in this field. The most suitable systems for geothermal sourcesare pointed out.</TEXT></DOC>
