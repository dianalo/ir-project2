GREENE</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committeeon Wednesday rejected the nomination of Debra R. Bowland to headthe Labor Department's wage and hour division, citing her work tooverturn a Louisiana wage law covering government contracts.   ``We shouldn't put somebody in charge of a law that they don'tbelieve in _ period,'' said Sen. Paul Simon, D-Ill., one of thenine senators to vote against the nomination. Six voted for it.   ``This is putting the fox in charge of the chicken coop,'' saidSen. Brock Adams, D-Wash., another opponent.   Bowland had been Louisian's Secretary of Labor from 1980 to 1982under Dave Treen, the only Republican governor in Louisiana inmodern history. She opposed the law under his administration.Later, as a lobbyist, she represented the opposition to theprevailing wage law, which was eventually repealed.   ``Prevailing wage'' laws require government contractors to paythe prevailing wage in the area of the work, and those wagesgenerally are defined by reference to union pay scales.   Bowland would have been in charge of enforcing the federalprevailing wage law, the Davis-Bacon Act.   Bowland supporters said she has pledged to enforce federal laws``vigorously'' and should be taken at her word. Sen. James M.Jeffords, R-Vt., said Bowland's opppositon to the Louisiana law wasbased on problems with the way it was being carried out andregulations derived from it.   They noted that the repeal occurred after her involvement andunder a Democratic administration.   But Sens. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., chairman of the committee,and Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio, both said it was clear from thecampaign in Louisiana that Bowland has a philosophical objection togovernment involvement in wage and hour regulation.   ``You have to ask yourself whether she is going to be committedto the implementation of this legislation,'' said Kennedy. ``I findit difficult to give her the benefit of the doubt.''   Bowland, 45, has been with the Labor Department since 1985 andheads the Women's Bureau.   Sen. Dave Durenberger, R-Minn., abstained. His spokesman said itwas because Durenberger had serious reservations about thenomination but thought the president should be able to pick hisnominees.</TEXT></DOC>
