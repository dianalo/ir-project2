 Though there is always a new product promising greaterfunctionality right around the comer, the presentation graphics market looksto be more active than usual in the upcoming year.andP;  New products are expectedfrom Lotus, Aldus, Software Publishing, and a number of others.andM;We were able to get a look at two soon-to-be-released programs while theywere still in the prerelease stage.andP;  While Aldus's Persuasion for Windows andFreelance Graphics for DOS are diametrically opposed in intent, both redefinethe features and functions you may expect in their respective categories.andO;OUTLINING A CONCEPT If you've shelved your purchase plans until a PC-basedversion of Persuasion becomes available, you're an old hand at the waitinggame.andP;  Rumors about Persuasion running under Windows have been floatingaround for about two years.andP;  Despite the lead time this has given the,competition, Persuasion is still one of the most innovative graphics packagesaround.andM;What makes Persuasion unique is its fully integrated outliner, which definesthe structure of the presentation.andP;  Persuasion outlines are fullyobject-oriented.andP;  In addition to text, they contain icons that aredynamically linked to the slides in your presentation.andP;  Any actions youperform in the outline, like typing copy, automatically affect the slide-andvisa versa.andP;  You can even import spreadsheets and open up Persuasion'sinternal data sheet from within the outliner.andM;In a similar vein, the icons available on the Outline menu are activeelements that you can use to format the appearance of your slides.andP;  Moresubtle-and powerful-icons let you insert breaks in order to force copy to anew text block, making it easy to create double-column word charts right fromthe outliner.andP;  You can even designate dependent (or child) slides.andP;  Thoughthe titles of the dependent slides appear in the outline only once,Persuasion will automatically create a parent slide that functions as a tableof contents and includes the headline for each child slide.andP;  You can easilyassemble an entire presentation from within this text-based module.andM;Anybody comfortable working with a WYSIWYG screen has nothing to fear withPersuasion.andP;  A simple click on one of the four icons that run along the rightside of the screen switches you into the more familiar slide sorter ordrawing screen view of your presentation.andP;  You can also select a speaker'snotes view.andM;The drawing screen is where you do most of your slide editing.andP;  Persuasion'smasters are not simple-minded backgrounds that are turned either on or off.andO;Each Persuasion presentation contains multiple masters-one for free-formtext, for example, and another for a double-column bullet chart.andP;  Ahorizontal bar chart might have a different master from a pie chart, butmasters can also share a common background that contains objects like companylogos, rules, and directional gradient fills.andP;  MASTERS AND MASTERPIECESPersuasion's way of grappling with the distinctions between slide masters andmaster backgrounds is only one indication of its complexity.andP;  SincePersuasion recognizes two kinds of text, text insertion has its own nuances.andO;Copy that is interactive with the outliner and works with the mastertemplates must be entered in a formatting box, or placeholder.andP;  If you wantto treat copy as an annotation, you must be sure to insert it outside theplaceholder.andM;This kind of subtlety does add power to the product, but it makes thelearning curve steeper.andP;  Fortunately, the program will come with 55auto-templates-basically blank presentations with color schemes and sets ofmasters; these can shield novice users from the need to edit the masters.andO;And, since the first layer of dialog boxes will contain the most commonlyused line widths, fill patterns, and colors, novices may never need to usePersuasion's powerful drawing tools and formatting options.andM;Advanced users will, of course, want to take advantage of Persuasion'sability to create and edit freehand outlines.andP;  And the program's grouping,alignment, and layering functions are essential features when managingcomplex pictures.andP;  Ambitious artists can also maximize the color, line style,and pattern-fill palettes in order to access a wider array of choices and theprogram's customization options.andM;Persuasion's approach to color selection is three-tiered: You can work withthe small palette of 16 colors, the maximized palette of 200 colors, or anediting dialog box to customize colors.andP;  However, Persuasion always reserves160 colors as straight uneditable RGB values.andP;  Only the 40 remaining hues canbe user-defined.andP;  Copying color schemes from one presentation to another notonly replaces these 40 customized colors, but also remaps them throughout thepresentation-a tricky problem if you want logos or other elements to remainconsistent.andM;Persuasion's charting functions are standard business fare, but itsflexibility shows in the way it lets you enhance the appearance of graphs.andO;For example, you can subselect elements in a graph for modification withoutlosing data links.andP;  A single, double, or triple click will select a chart,all the bars in a chart, or a single bar in a chart in turn.andP;  The only trickis to leave the previous level of selection active while you continue toclick.andP;  Unfortunately, Persuasion doesn't support warm links directly tospreadsheet files.andP;  Though it does support DDE, it does so only in anextremely limited form that does not establish a permanent link with theexternal Excel spreadsheet.andM;The inclusion of Adobe Type Manager with Persuasion gives it (and all yourother Windows applications) access to an enormous selection of high-qualityfonts.andP;  Automatic speaker's notes and audience handouts make managing thesedetails of a presentation almost transparent.andP;  Besides these, custom driversfor the MAGICorp.andP;  and Autographix service bureaus are planned to let yougenerate high-quality slides hassle-free.andM;Judging from this preview, Persuasion will be more than a match for mostpresentation graphics programs on the market.andP;  Still, the program stands orfalls by its integrated outliner and the approach it demands.andP;  Only you candecide if the power its outline affords is worth the effort of committingyourself totally to its working methodology.andP;  RENOVATING A CLASSIC At thesame time that WYSIWYG programs like Persuasion are stressing their textualoutlining capabilities, form-driven programs like Lotus's Freelance areincorporating more graphical, object-oriented features.andP;  For an old Freelancehand, it is a weirdly wonderful experience to click on a bar chart and havethe data form pop up.andP;  Yet the new Freelance Graphics for DOS, Lotus's latestversion of its DOS presentation package, does just this, embedding associateddata forms within the DRW file that designates the actual slide image.andM;The elegance of this design means that when you edit the data form it willautomatically update the existing graph.andP;  No longer do you have to go throughthe trouble of deleting the old graph before you image the new one.andP;  Thebenefits don't stop there.andP;  Now when you change output devices and switchfrom a film recorder to a laser printer, the chart is automaticallyregenerated.andM;Other major improvements include both Freelance's newfound ability to apply acommon backdrop to all the slides in a presentation and on-the-fly scalableBitstream fonts that are fully visible on screen (the latter wasn't fullyimplemented in our beta version).andP;  The program's new auto-charting featureswill allow you to generate up-to-the minute graphs from linked spreadsheetsfrom the DOS prompt, as Lotus Graphwriter II does now.andP;  FASTER CHARTS Lotushas stretched the old familiar Freelance interface to the limit in this newversion.andP;  The status panel appears much the same as always.andP;  But if you clickon one of the attributes of a selected object-the color of text, forinstance-the topline menu changes to a mini color-selection menu.andP;  This is awonderful editing shortcut that allows you to change a pie chart to a barchart, for example, with just two mouse clicks.andM;If you've ever worked with Freelance clip art, you'll feel right at home withthe new chart gallery.andP;  Just pull a gallery file (that contains six charts)onto the spare page and use an Alt-key combination to copy the graph of yourchoice to the slide page.andP;  The only difference between the 50-plus charts andregular clip art is that the charts in the chart gallery have embedded,editable data forms.andM;Word charts are easier than ever to create, thanks to a new bundled outliningutility.andP;  This modified version of Symantec's GrandView contains only asubset of GrandView's outlining and organizational functions.andP;  Butproprietary links with Freelance enable you to generate a whole series ofslides with minimal formatting effort.andP;  The outliner is a TSR and costs someRAM, but Freelance Graphics for DOS can be configured to run in a smallersize, which frees up 30K of memory.andP;  And Lotus has finally promised to addmuch-needed expanded memory support, though not necessarily in the initialrelease.andP;  ALMOST PERFECT The new Freelance still has its limitations.andP;  Youmust turn the backdrops on for each slide in two modules-an awkward system.andO;And it still falls short of full object orientation because you must split achart into objects to directly edit elements in a graph.andP;  The program stilldoesn't automatically generate speaker's notes or audience handouts, andgradient fills are still available only through custom drivers for slideservice output.andP;  Finally, the program still supports only 13 on-screen colors(including the background) in the active palette.andM;However, the new features found in Freelance Graphics for DOS add a lot ofpower and convenience without giving up the very real advantages that thismarket leader has long supplied.andP;  You still get a large data set, a runtimescreen show, interactive manipulation of spreadsheet data, and, perhaps mostimportant-backward compatibility with your existing library of Freelancepresentations.andP;  For the DOS user, it's hard to do better in today's market.andO;PARESENTATION GRAPHICS; SUITABILITY TO TASK Word charts evaluates the easewith which you can create word charts, the most common type of chart used inpresentations.andP;  A satisfactory score reflects the ability to create wordcharts easily, either by filling in tables or by placing word-wrapped textdirectly on the graphic.andP;  Extra points are given for more-elaborate multilinetemplates that allow automatic creation of bullet charts, outlines, andmulticolumn tables.andP;  Support for high-quality scalable typefaces is anotherplus.andP;  Data charts evaluates the program's ability to create basic businesscharts (bar, pie, line, scatter, and area) and customize them.andP;  We alsoconsidered the quality of the facilities for importing and manipulating data including the ability to maintain live data links), the intelligence of labeland legend handling, the ease of selecting fill patterns and colors, and theaesthetic quality of the charts.andP;  Pictures and diagrams To be useful forcreating diagrams, annotating charts, and embellishing presentations withclip art, a program must come equipped with a range of basic drawing toolsfor drawing boxes, lines, circles, and arrows.andP;  It should also be able tosize and place vector images on your slides.andP;  More useful are products thatcan group and ungroup objects, cut and paste, and duplicate or flip them;most useful of all are the ones that can edit the nodes of Bezier curves.andO;Color handling, the ability to import a range of vector and bitmap fileformats, and the range and quality of the package's clip art collection arealso important.andP;  Technical charts None of these business graphics packagesoffers the capabilities of a specialized technical charting package, butnearly all make some concessions to the needs of technical users.andP;  A packageearns a minimal score for basic technical graphs if it produces line andscatter charts with logarithmic scaling.andP;  Extra points are given for theability to handle over 10,000 data points, as well as for multiple axes,error bars, curve filling, and other advanced technical charting features.andO;Business presentations assesses the product's suitability for creatingpresentations.andP;  Considerations include how easily you can manipulate andprint entire presentations, how quickly you can create presentations fromoutlines, and how flexible you find the background and gradient fill support.andO;Other factors are screen-show capabilities and how easily you can produce35-mm.andP;  slides.andP;  The best packages offer an array of global style and coloroptions through intelligent slide masters; they can also generate speakers'notes and handouts automatically.andP;  EDITOR'S CHOICE * Microsoft PowerPoint Inthe past, PC-based business graphics software was more of a collection oftools than an application.andP;  Data charting, word charting, and annotationfunctions were relegated to separate menus and even separate modules.andP;  Buttoday, as power spreadsheets take over many of the functions of traditionalcharting packages, and as Windows makes it easier to mix and match exactlythe right graphics tools, business graphics programs are shifting theirfocus.andP;  They are now most important as coordinators for arranging thesedisparate elements into consistent presentations.andM;If presentation processing is the wave of the future, no package can hold acandle to Microsoft PowerPoint ($495), our Editors' Choice.andP;  Breakingdecisively with the modular, table-driven past, PowerPoint uses Windows 3.0'sgraphical interface to excellent advantage.andP;  Its integrated, visualenvironment for sequencing slides makes it easy to find the slides you want,rearrange them, or borrow them from other presentations.andP;  And itsobject-oriented interface lets you easily modify slide elements directly,simply by pointing and clicking.andM;PowerPoint isn't the first or the only program with this kind of integration,but a myriad of timesavers is what gives it its decisive edge.andP;  Its masterslides, word-chart styles, and global color schemes-neither too basic nor toocomplex-help ordinary business users put together sharp-looking presentationsrapidly.andP;  And Microsoft has come up with the best solution yet to the problemof creating slide output: Its custom service link with Genigraphics, whichencompasses carefully matched color palettes, professionally selected clipart, and trouble-free communications as well as slide imaging services, makesthis process about as painless as it can possibly be.andP;  THE BEST FOR CHARTINGThat said, it's important to point out that PowerPoint's built-in chartingand drawing tools are minimal.andP;  This is a deliberate decision: For all butthe most basic business charts, Microsoft expects you to use Excel 3.0, whosesuperlative charts can be incorporated seamlessly into your presentationsthrough Microsoft's innovative object embedding and linking technology.andO;Passing a live chart object rather than data between spreadsheet and graphicspackage has important advantages: It saves you a data import step, and aspreadsheet is a far better place to manipulate your data than a graphicsprogram.andP;  But that's no help at all if what you need is a program to makefancy charts.andM;In this case, you might want to pick Charisma.andP;  Though this $495 package iscomplex and sometimes awkward to use, the power and versatility of itscharting functions are unsurpassed.andP;  Its also one of the few packages thatlet you edit drawings containing Bezier curves, making it a natural if youneed to produce complex charts and diagrams for desktop-published documents.andO;On the DOS side, Freelance Plus is also strong in the data-chartingdepartment.andP;  It has a particular flair for repetitive charting, where itsstrong data-linking capabilities with Lotus 1-2-3 worksheets give it an edge.andO;WHERE IT'S GOING Microsoft won't be alone in the field much longer.andP;  Expectadditional announcements of powerful new Windows presentation programs in thecoming months, both from major players like Aldus and Software Publishing,and brash unknowns.andP;  Of these, the long-awaited Windows version of Aldus'sPersuasion may be the most interesting-and controversial.andP;  Persuasion'spowerful integrated outliner, flexible templates, and advanced word-chartingfeatures may or may not strike you as the most significant innovation inpresentations since the invention of the slide projector.andP;  But the power andrichness of Persuasion's comprehensive capabilities make it a mark for everycompetitor to shoot for.andM;You can get an idea of what to expect from Lotus's Windows product by lookingat Freelance Graphics for OS/2.andP;  The multitemplate slide masters of this richand complex package are even more flexible and powerful than PowerPoint's(though they're also more complicated to use).andP;  And unlike Microsoft, Lotusdoesn't make you pay extra for a robust charting engine.andP;  Unfortunately, thehuge memory appetite, sluggish performance, and shortage of drivers of theOS/2 version (a real drawback of using OS/2 today) make it impossible torecommend for most users.andP;  But its fine qualities deserve amore-than-honorable mention, and, judging by this preview, the upcomingFreelance Graphics for Windows should really be something worth having.andM;So where does this leave diehard DOS users who can't or don't want to move toWindows? Well, if your money is burning a hole in your pocket right now,Applause II and DrawPerfect are solid, all-around performers.andP;  HarvardGraphics, though now very dated in its design, is still a reasonable choicefor simple business charts and presentations.andP;  But if you can, you'd do wellto wait for Lotus's revamped Freelance Graphics for DOS, which should beshipping soon after you read this.andP;  Judging from our advance look, thisinnovative package is not only more powerful than its predecessor at datacharting but, with its pop-up outliner, on-screen font support, andpoint-and-click manipulation of elements, it's a fully competitivepresentation tool as well.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
