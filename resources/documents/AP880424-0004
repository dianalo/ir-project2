ROTHBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Political Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Jesse Jackson said Sunday he would bewilling to talk with those holding U.S. hostages in Lebanon, andsuggested that he would be more effective in winning their freedomthat would his Democratic presidential rival, Michael Dukakis.   The Reagan administration has refused as a matter of policy tonegotiate with hostage-takers. Jackson said he would be willing totalk to anyone _ including the kidnappers.   ``In this world, in this ambiguous world, you must not set uppreconditions that stop effectiveness,'' Jackson said at a rally inWashington. ``I would meet with anyone I could meet with to get thehostages out of Beirut.''   Jackson's remarks came in the final weekend of the Pennsylvaniaprimary campaign, as he and Dukakis set aside their best-friendscampaign style. Dukakis rejected as ``absurd'' Jackson's suggestionthat he offer specific budget figures for programs he favors.   Both candidates sounded jobs themes as they campaigned in thisindustrial state. Dukakis talked about steel industry jobs andeconomic development during a whistle-stop train trip through thewestern half of the state.   Jackson spent the night with an unemployed steelworker and hisfamily in Aliquippa, preached at a local church and met withpaperworkers in Lock Haven before flying to Washington.   Dukakis is considered a sure bet to win most of the 178Democratic convention delegations at stake in the Pennsylvania onTuesday. Jackson's best chance to make an impression would be inthe non-binding preference vote that also will be part of Tuesday'sballot.   With 78 Republican delegates also at stake, Vice PresidentGeorge Bush should reach the 1,139 total he needs to clinch the GOPpresidential nomination with a majority of the delegates to theRepublican National Convention in August in New Orleans.   ``Vote 12 times for Mike Dukakis,'' said fliers beingdistributed to Democratic voters in the state's 2nd CongressionalDistrict. That appeal was not an invitation to vote fraud, but aneffort to help voters understand the long and complex ballot thatwill confront them Tuesday.   Democratic voters will elect delegates identified as supportersof Dukakis or Jackson. For Republicans the task is even moredifficult since the ballot will not identify the presidentialpreference of delegate candidates.   The Dukakis campaign was spending $25,000 on radio commercialsthat begin:   ``On April 26 in the Pennsylvania primary, one vote for MikeDukakis won't be enough. If you want to help send Mike to the WhiteHouse, you've got to vote for all the Dukakis delegates in ourarea.''   The Jackson campaign also was distributing fliers explaining tovoters what they must do to support the former civil rightsactivist.   Jackson's delegate strength is concentrated in Philadelphia andPittsburgh where the vast majority of the state's black voterslive. Dukakis is expected to win most of the delegates in otherparts of the state.   Meanwhile, Democrats in the U.S. territory of Guam decidedSunday that its six delegates _ representing three votes at thenational convention _ will remain uncommitted in an attempt to havemore political clout.   ``The idea behind our uncommitted stance was to allow the Guamdelegation to discuss Guam issues so more people could become awareof what we want,'' Daryl Taggerty, vice chairman of the party'sdelegate selection committee, said Sunday following the party'scaucuses.   The Guam delegation includes former territorial Gov. Ricardo J.Bordallo, who was convicted of accepting bribes in exchange forgovernment contracts but remains free pending appeal in federalcourts.   While Dukakis and Jackson battled for Democratic delegates inPennsylvania, conservative Republicans were trying to influenceBush's selection of a running mate.   Curt Clinkscales, a conservative activist, has formed anunauthorized committee to raise money to promote former U.N.ambassador Jeane Kirkpatrick as the GOP vice presidential candidate.   Mark Salter, a spokesman for Mrs. Kirkpatrick, said, ``Shebelieves the decision on the vice president should be solely thatof Vice President Bush.''   The former U.N. ambassador, a favorite of conservatives becauseof her hardline views on foreign policy, briefly considered gettinginto the presidential race, but finally decided against it.   Clinkscales said he has raised $100,000 and collected the namesof 1,400 volunteers.   Through most of the Pennsylvania campaign, Dukakis and Jacksonavoided any criticism of each other, concentrating instead on Bushand the Reagan administration.   Their nice-guy approach was strained slightly Saturday nightwhen they debated in Pittsburgh and Jackson chided Dukakis forfailing to attach price tags to his proposals.   ``I'm not just for Head Start, I'm willing to pay for HeadStart,'' Jackson said during the debate. ``I have put numberstogether to pay for my dreams.''   After the debate, Jackson said Dukakis had failed ``to answerthe budget question. ... I know it's good to project for a nationalhealth care plan, which I support. But it will cost.''   ``I don't know what he's trying to do,'' Dukakis said Sundaywhen asked about the pressure from Jackson to come up with budgetfigures.   ``You can't prepare a budget now for next year,'' he toldreporters on his campaign train. ``That's absurd.''   On the hostage question, Jackson criticized Dukakis' stance thatterrorists should not be negotiated with.   ``I've raised the point in several debates this year,'' Jacksonsaid. ``Every time a question comes up about terrorism, Mr. Dukakissays: `I'm against terrorism.... We should not negotiate withterrorists. In the Middle East, never negotiate with terrorists. Betough.'''   ``I disagree with that,'' Jackson went on. ``If I could getthose hostages out, I would bring them back home.''   He said making a deal with kidnappers would be no worse thandealing with the likes of Panamanian strongman Manuel AntonioNoriega.   ``We say now if Noriega will come out of Panama, we'll send himto another country. That's a concession.... But the fact is, theobject must be to free Americans who are held hostage in the MiddleEast.''   Nine Americans are believed held by kidnappers in Lebanon. Theyare: Terry Anderson, chief Middle East correspondent of TheAssociated Press; Thomas Sutherland; Frank Herbert Reed; JosephJames Cicippio; Edward Austin Tracy; Jesse Turner; Robert Polhill;Alann Steen and Marine Lt. Col. William R. Higgins.   Jackson spent Saturday night with 35-year-old Doug Cafrelli andhis wife and five children. After working 13 years at LTV Steel,Cafrelli was laid off in 1985.   He said he got a call Saturday asking if he'd be willing to haveJackson as a house guest for one night.   ``I was in a daze, in a dream,'' he said.   The next morning, Jackson sat with Mr. and Mrs. Cafrelli at thekitchen table in their two-story frame house and had a breakfastscrambled eggs, bacon and sausage. Then he preached at the localMethodist church.</TEXT></DOC>
