The case, Wilko vs. Swan, tested the limits of mandatoryarbitration agreements that brokerages typically require to settledisputes. Ruling two years later, the Supreme Court saidarbitration pacts weren't binding under a 1933 federal securitieslaw.   The decision stood until last week when the court reverseditself, closing what was widely viewed as the final window ofopportunity for an investor to bypass industry-run arbitrationproceedings and sue a broker.   The 5-4 ruling means that if an investor signs a contract with abrokerage house requiring arbitration in the event of a fraudclaim, a dispute must go to a panel of arbitrators for resolution.The courts won't listen.   ``This puts everything in place,'' said William J. Fitzpatrick,general counsel for the Securities Industry Association. ``It saysif you have an arbitration agreement, no matter what theory israised or how you peg your claim ... it goes to arbitration.''   The Supreme Court in 1984 said all state securities law caseshad to be arbitrated if a signed pact exists. In 1987, the courtapplied the same standard to an anti-fraud section of the federalSecurities Exchange Act of 1934.   The current ruling applies to a narrower anti-fraud provision ofthe Securities Act of 1933 that gives people who buy securities anavenue to complain about brokers.   The three rulings cover all bases for how a client can contest abroker-dealer's behavior.   While the latest decision should clear federal court dockets ofan estimated 100-plus cases in which investors have challengedarbitration agreements, it won't clear away criticism of a systemmany claim is biased in favor of the securities industry.   In arbitration agreements, investors normally waive their rightto sue and agree that fraud claims will be resolved by a panel ofarbitrators appointed under federal guidelines by the New YorkStock Exchange, National Association of Securities Deealers orother industry body.   The number of arbitration claims has increased more thanseven-fold this decade, to 6,100 in 1988 from just 830 in 1980.   In the NYSE system, one securities industry arbitrator and twofrom outside the industry conduct a hearing into a claim and canissue judgments and award penalties. The exchange claims itsarbitration decisions are about 50-50 for investors and brokers,with 1988 awards ranging from $100 to $2 million.   A recent Securities and Exchange Commission study of NYSE casesfound that arbitration is indeed cheaper and quicker thanlitigation. From filing to judgment, court cases took about 18months, vs. 12 for arbitration. Median legal costs were $5,100 forlitigation and $3,250 for arbitration. But the amount of claimsrecovered did not differ, the study found.   The SEC last year also found that only 39 percent of cashaccounts _ typically used by individual investors _ at majorbrokerages mandated abitration but more than 95 percent of moresophisticated options and margin accounts did.   Investor groups complain that brokerages don't always tell newclients they can't sue. To that end, the SEC is forcing firms toprovide more information. Massachusetts has gone even further,banning arbitration agreements that prohibit legal action. But afederal district court blocked the law and an appeals court hearingis set for next month.   More than a dozen states are awaiting the outcome of theMassachusetts case before enacting similar anti-arbitration laws.
