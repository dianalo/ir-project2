Officials at the Longhorn Army Ammunition plant planned to firethe two sections of the unarmed, 5,500-pound ballistic missile inhorizontal position today. After consuming their solid fuel, thesections were to be crushed.   The operation comes under terms of the Intermediate-range NuclearForces treaty signed in 1987 by President Reagan and Soviet leaderMikhail Gorbachev.   The INF treaty requires elimination of 859 Americanintermediate-range and shorter range missiles and 1,752 similarSoviet missiles within three years.   A 10-member Soviet inspection team was to monitor today'sdestruction of the 169th and last Pershing 1A. Hundreds of largerPershing 2 missiles and ground-launched cruise missiles are alsobeing destroyed under the treaty.   The Soviets began destroying several classes of similar missilesa year ago.   Nuclear warheads are removed beforehand from the missiles markedfor destruction, which have a range of 300 to 3,400 miles.   The destruction of the Pershing 1A is being handled by MortonThiokol Inc., which built many of the Pershing motors.   In September, then-Vice President Bush made a campaign stop ofthe first missile destruction at Longhorn, hailing the event as``the day we began to reverse the arms race.''</TEXT></DOC>
