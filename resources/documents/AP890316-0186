Sharon, who was architect of Israel's disastrous 1982 invasion ofLebanon, demanded a worldwide Jewish effort to end the dialoguebetween the United States and the Palestinians.   ``Our goal must be their (the PLO's) destruction,'' the outspokenSharon said in an interview on Israel radio. ``We should have killedArafat long ago.''   He was among right-wing Cabinet ministers from Prime MinisterYitzhak Shamir's political party, the Likud bloc, who rejected onThursday a suggestion by U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker IIIthat Israel talk with the PLO.   But a leading Palestinian figure on Thursday praised Baker'scomment.   Salah Khalaf, second in command to Arafat in Fatah, the main PLOguerrilla group, described as ``positive'' and ``practical'' Baker'sstatement before a congressional hearing that Israel might have tonegotiate with the PLO.   ``Not bad, not bad at all, Mr. Baker,'' Khalaf, also known as AbuIyad, was quoted as saying in a telephone interview from Tunis withthe London-based newsletter Mideast Mirror. A copy of the interviewwas telexed to The Associated Press.   Shamir's spokesman, Avi Pazner, disclosed on Thursday that theprime minister has been holding secret meetings since last Decemberwith Palestinian leaders who do not belong to the PLO.   Pazner confirmed a report on Israel TV that secret meetings wereunder way.   He told The Associated Press, ``Its purpose is to have a dialoguewith non-PLO Palestinians. He has been meeting with non-PLOPalestinians, and he will continue to do so.''   He declined to identify the Palestinians, saying ``it couldendanger their lives.''   On Wednesday, Shamir's foreign minister, Moshe Arens, had reactedstrongly to Baker's suggestions that Israel consider talks directlywith the PLO if other peace avenues fail.   Arens, who is visiting the United States before an expected Apriltrip by Shamir, expressed his displeasure with Baker's statements tocongresssional committees in a 20-minute telephone call to Baker.   Pazner said Shamir's talks should not be misconstrued as supportfor Baker's suggestion.   ``There will be no negotiations with the PLO,'' Pazner said.   Shamir repeatedly has rejected all talks with the PLO, contendingit is a terrorist group. But he says he is willing to talk withnon-PLO Palestinians in the occupied territories to try to achievepeace.   Most Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip reject thisapproach, insisting that the PLO is their representative. TheIsraeli government contends they have been frightened into takingthis position for fear of reprisal.   Deputy Foreign Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Baker'sstatements sabotaged Israel's efforts to draw non-PLO Palestiniansinto the peace process.   ``If we say ahead of time that these partners aren't to be found,(if we say) let's move on to the radicals, then we are sabatogingattempts to find the moderates,'' he told army radio.   Deputy Prime Minister David Levy told Israel radio, ``This nationhas decided not to commit suicide. Israel will not allow theestablishment of a Palestinian state because it is a danger to ourexistence.   ``What do we have to talk about with the PLO? The weather? TheKoran? The Torah?''   The reference was to the holy books of Islam and Judaism.   Finance Minister Shimon Peres, leader of the center-left LaborParty, was more accepting of Baker's idea.   ``If the PLO has ideas, we will not censor them,'' he told Israeltelevision. ``We will not negotiate with an organization thatengages in terror. But a nation? Yes, if the nation identifies withthis organization, we cannot censor their views.''   Israel's two largest independent daily newspapers, Maariv andYediot Ahronot, on Thursday carried banner headlines portraying theArens-Baker dispute as a major conflict over Middle East policies.   In Damascus, the Democratic Front for the Liberation ofPalestine, a Marxist faction of the PLO, on Thursday condemnedmeetings between Palestinians in the occupied territories andIsraeli government officials.   In the last few months a series of meetings have taken placebetween members of Israel's civil administration in the occupiedterritories and prominent Palestinians.   ``Those (contacts) run by the civil administration only aim atcreating tension and divisions in an attempt to ease theinternational anger against Israel's fascist ways at curbing thepeople's uprising'' against Israeli rule,'' a Democratic Frontspokesman said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.   He said his organization supports talks between left-wing Israelipeace activists and Palestinian leaders.   Shamir has revealed no details of the new peace plan he isexpected to advance while in America. He has hinted it will call forsome kind of ``interim'' autonomy while a long-term solution isworked out for the occupied lands.   This approach parallels the proposal in the U.S.-brokered 1978Camp David peace accords with Egypt. The PLO and most Arab nationshave rejected it as unworkable.</TEXT></DOC>
