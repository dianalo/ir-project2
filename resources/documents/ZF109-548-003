Cameron Thompson, &quot;We feel DAL will be the standardin the Mac market and that it will give a big boost to products like GQL[Andyne's database query tool]&quot; Apple expects 20 DAL-compatible third-partyapplications to be available by year's end.andP;  Integrators and at least onemajor database vendor also are beginning to support DAL.andP;  Businessland Inc.andO;recently sent 240 of its consultants, systems engineers and marketing reps totraining classes to learn about DAL.andP;  The company now is negotiating withApple over DAL pricing APPLE MUST DECIDE WHETHER DAL SHOULD FULFILL ITSORIGINAL PROMISE.andP;  and support and plans to start pushing solutions based onthe technology soon.andM;Relational database vendor Ingres Corp. recently signed a marketing agreementthat calls for it to distribute both DAL and GQL.andP;  &quot;This is all part of ourmove into the Mac market,&quot; says Bob Friedman, Ingres's desktop productsmanager.andP;  Apple has set the standard for Mac-to-host connectivity, and DAL isit.&quot; A Competitive FieldandM;Some users and vendors have been less than wholehearted in their embrace ofthe technology, however.andP;  Database vendors Oracle Corp. and Sybase Inc. havedeclined to distribute the product, preferring to promote their ownproprietary APIS, such as Oracie's SQL*Net.andP;  In fact, Oracle, which two yearsago promised to develop CL/I client support for its Oracle-for-Macintoshdatabase management system, later quietly killed that project.andP;  DebraMureaga, Oracle-for-Mac product manager, says the decision to pull CL/Isupport was 'just a question of resources.&quot; Oracle still promises to supportfuture versions of DAL.andM;Some users also have reservations about DAL.andP;  Boston-based Liberty MutualInsurance Group, for example, plans to use DAL to access DB2 data using Macs.andO;But the company also will use competing product., such as Sequel Link, aseries of APIs for specific databases marketed by Techgnosis Inc. of BocaRaton, Fla.andP;  According to Liberty Mutual chief database analyst Dan Ekerson,who works in the company's Portsmouth, N.H., office, although DAL can beeasier to work with, Sequel Link supports more host databases and has someperformance advantages because it avoids the two-stage language translationused by DAL.andM;Another user organization, The NutraSweet Co. of Deirfield, Ill., is passingon DAL in favor of a more traditional approach to database access.andO;NutraSweet, which is building a sales information system for executives andanalysts in its sweetener division, will have Macs with GQL accessing Ingresdata on a Digital VAX via an asynchronous connection to a Digital terminalserver.andP;  &quot;Since we're only accessing one database, we don't really needsomething like DAL,&quot; says NutraSweet systems analyst Kamran Salehi.andM;DAL critics also point out that there are some functional limitations to theproduct.andP;  Since DAL needs to be able to work with a large number of SQLdatabases, it is based on a small subset of the SQL language that is commonto all of them.andP;  That means DAL cannot handle some sophisticated statementsthat deal with such things as outer joins and locking.andP;  And that limits DAL'susefulness in certain applications such as those that are transactionoriented.andM;Even vendors committed to DAL say those kinds of limitations have slowed useracceptance.andP;  &quot;DAL has been in a lot of beta tests and evaluation cycles.andP;  Butat this point, acceptance has been much slower than we anticipated,&quot; saysAndyne's Thompson.andM;Apple officials acknowledge DAL's limitations.andP;  But they say some will becorrected soon.andP;  &quot;There are certain things in SQL that DAL can't do,&quot; admitsApple's DAL product manager Lance Hoffman.andP;  &quot;But we're doing our best tocover most of the bases.andP;  &quot;andM;The company is hoping DAL will get a big boost at the end of this year whenApple finally ships the long-awaited System 9.0 of its Mac operating system.andO;DAL will be integrated into the new system software in what Apple calls aData Access Manager.andP;  That integration could improve performance.andP;  It shouldalso make it easier for ISVs to incorporate DAL SUpport into theirapplications.andM;Yet observers say DAL won't receive widespread industry support until Appleanswers one fundamental question: Is DAL a universal data access technologyor just a Mac-to-SQL host connectivity tool? In order for DAL to fulfill itsoriginal promise as a universal data access language, observers say, Applewould have to develop DAL DOS and os/2 client products and UNIX serverproducts.andM;For the ultimate success of the product, it's important that it fit into asmany desktop systems as possible,&quot; says Businessland technology marketingmanager Timothy Becker.andP;  &quot;We've encouraged them [Apple] to do that.andP;  But ithasn't been their top priority.&quot;andM;Apple has promised limited UNIX support by early next year, but DOS and os/2client support are obvious sticking points.andP;  On one hand, DAL might not takeoff without universal client support.andP;  On the other hand, by extending DAL toDOS and os/2 clients, Apple could be giving away an important technology thatit has been investing in for two years.andP;  &quot;We haven't made a decision on thatyet, frankly,&quot; says Apple's Hoffman.andM;A DAL for the Rest of Us?andM;&quot;We realize that if DAL is to be seen as anything but a Mac-only product,we're going to have to do something soon,&quot; Hoffman continues.andP;  &quot;But we're notsure we're the ones who could do the best job of developing and supporting[DAL- on DOS and 6SI21.andP;  We're looking at alternatives.&quot;andM;Hoffman declines to say what those alternatives are.andP;  Observers believe theycould include licensing the DAL technology to Microsoft or another vendor inthe DOS and os/2 markets.andM;Now that DAL has graduated from vapor to reality, it will be an increasinglyimportant technology, at least for Mac users seeking access to host data.andO;Products Using DAL on the Desktop Acius Cupertino, Calif.andP;  4th DimensionRelational database Circle No.andP;  250 Andyne Computing Ltd.
