From the mid-1970sthrough 1986 oil and gas steadily lost markets to coal in the electricutility and industrial steam sectors. These shifts took the form of directconversions of a few plants from oil and gas to coal firing and the constructionof many new coal-fired boilers. These new boilers have not only met increasedenergy requirements, but also have displaced the use of oil and naturalgas at older plants. There is now a possibility that new electric generatingplants will be built with natural gas as a primary fuel, for the firsttime in almost 15 years. In this paper the authors examine the history,the current status, and future prospects of interfuel competition betweencoal, oil and natural gas.</TEXT></DOC>
