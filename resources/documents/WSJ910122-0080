Just this pastweekend, the U.S. ambassador to NATO, William H. Taft IV,said in Brussels that the crackdown will force the Westernalliance to rethink its basic policies toward the Soviets.Last year, leading Soviet figure Georgii Arbatov wrote anessay on the topic: Does the army serve the nation, or doesthe nation serve the army? It's beginning to seem that thelatter is the case.   A Soviet military magazine recently revealed that Sovietfarmers were unable to ship this year's record crops becausethe military had diverted thousands of trucks and railwaycars during the crucial weeks. The army needed the equipment,it claims, to move troops and tanks behind the UralMountains, where they would not be covered by recently signedarms-control treaties. The army risked national famine tosave a few armored brigades.</LP><TEXT>   The military brass pat themselves on the back for theirquick action and blame the whole mess on the diplomats forsigning the treaties in the first place. There are alsosuggestions that the Soviet military officials have beenmisleading political leaders, in an effort to embarrass themat the talks. Eduard Shevardnadze has said that he finallydecided to resign when he learned from American negotiatorsof the Ural tank movements. His own military had concealedthe operation from him.   These events, and the bloody &quot;black beret&quot; assaults ongovernment offices in Lithuania and Latvia, suggest a growingself-assurance among the military leadership. On anintellectual level this self-assurance has been developingfor some time.   One of the bizarre episodes of the past year has been theelevation of a crank writer named Karem Rash. Mr. Rash'sseries of articles on &quot;The Army and Culture&quot; led seven issuesof an important Soviet military journal. They are requiredreading in many military circles and his ideas are reflectedin the speeches of leading generals.   He argues, &quot;the military should feel that they are thebackbone and sacred institution of a thousand years (of)statehood. . . . At the turning points in history, themilitary was to be the main, real hope of the people andfrequently fulfilled assignments that at first glance seemedinappropriate to them.&quot;   Mr. Rash embodies many of the prejudices that accompany amilitary dictatorship: extreme xenophobia, disgust withconsumerism and an attack on &quot;feminine&quot; values.   The ascendancy of these ideas suggests an alliance betweenCommunist reactionaries and extreme Russophiles. The militaryjournals have even begun praising the imperial armies of theczars. The combined effect is to emphasize the historicalgreatness of the Soviet military, even in times whenpoliticians were contributing to national chaos.   Reformist efforts to depoliticize the military, that is,to remove it from the thumb of Communist Party control, areclearly failing. To head the shell &quot;depoliticization&quot;department, Mikhail Gorbachev has appointed Nikolai Slyaga, avociferous opponent of pluralism and an advocate of partycontrol.   During the thrilling days of last summer, democrats saidthat the military would not engineer a takeover since thegenerals would have no idea what to do once in power.Apparently, ideas are occurring to them.</TEXT></DOC>
