According to the study, released this week by the House Ways andMeans Committee, the wealthiest 20 percent of the nation'shouseholds saw, on average, a 12 percent increase in income over the15-year period, from $60,299 to $67,416.   At the same time, the poorest fifth experienced an 8 percentdrop, from $5,507 to $5,107.   ``This widening disparity between rich and poor, particularly forfamilies with children, is very disheartening,'' said Rep. ThomasDowney, D-N.Y. and the chairman of the subcommittee on humanresources. ``These families are not even standing still. They arelosing ground.''   The biggest reason for the poor becoming poorer, the report says,was cuts in welfare programs. Aid to families with dependentchildren was reduced over 30 percent during the period; food stampbenefits and other social programs also were cut.   An economist for the committee, who preferred not to be quoted byname, said statistics also show that more jobs paid poverty-levelwages in 1987 than in 1979, midway through the survey period.   He also pointed out that more families consist of never-wedmothers and their children.   While the total number of Americans under 18 years of agedecreased by about 800,000 from 1960 to 1987, from 63.7 million to62.9 million, the number living with a never-married mother grewfrom 243,000 to 4.2 million.   Statistics also show that, after adjusting for inflation, 80percent of all single working-mothers earned less in 1987 than in1979.   In families with both a mother and father raising children,income among the poorest dropped 11.3 percent from 1973 to 1987,from $14,038 annually to $12,796, the report said.   The good news in the report is for the elderly who, married ornot, saw their incomes rise 20 percent to 30 percent, on average,from 1973 to 1987.   These increases were explained by rising Social Security benefitsand the fact that a greater portion of the elderly populationcollected pensions in 1987 than in 1973, the report said.   The years 1973, 1979 and 1987 were used in calculating incomesfor the study, ``Background Material and Data on Programs Within theJurisdiction of the Committee on Ways and Means,'' because they werepeak years within economic cycles.</TEXT></DOC>
