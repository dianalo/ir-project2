At least that's how it seemed.   ABC had promised to solve Laura Palmer's murder in Saturdaynight's episode, which comes during television sweeps, of its weirdand wild series set in a logging town in the Pacific Northwest.   Of course, creators David Lynch and Mark Frost didn't make itneat. Leland Palmer was not arrested for his daughter's murder. Andhe seems about to kill again. In fact, somebody else was hauled offto jail.   In fact, FBI agent Dale Cooper and Sheriff Harry S. Trumanhaven't solved the murder, though there's a chance Cooper willproperly interpret a vision he has seen and save Laura's cousinfrom death at the hands of Leland, who apparently is also the``Bob'' that fans have known is the killer. Or a spirit who movesthe killer. Or something.   Earlier in the episode, Benjamin Horn, just minutes aftertelling his own daughter he was in love with Laura, was dragged offto the sherrif's station for questioning in Laura's murder.   Benjamin, the debonaire but dastardly dad, was always a goodcandidate for killer, what with his ownership of a brothel, hissexual wanderings and dealings with drug dealers.   ``Twin Peaks'' could use a boost in the ratings the solutioncould generate. According to the latest A.C. Nielsen Co. numbers,the series was third in its time period last week, with a 7.9rating and a 16 share.   A rating point equals 931,000 television households. A share isthe percentage of television sets in use in the time period thatare turned to the show.</TEXT></DOC>
