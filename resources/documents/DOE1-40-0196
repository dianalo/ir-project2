Volume 1 emphasizes heat transfer operations. Thecontents are: Fundamentsls of momentum and heat transfer. Scaling inlaminar and turbulent heat and mass transfer. Heat flux in the Benar-Rayleighproblem. Hydrodynamics of free liquid jets and their influence on heattransfer. Natural convection heat transfer to power law fluids. Naturalconvection in evaporating droplets. Principles of heat and mass transferwith liquid evaporation. Bubble nucleation, growth, and departure inboiling heat transfer. Forced convection boiling in uniformly heatedchannels. Transient boiling heat transfer under forced convection. Predictionof heat transfer during forced convection subcooled boiling. Liquid metalheat transfer in turbulent pipe flows. Mixed convection in buoyant plumes.Nucleation and growth in the diffusion cloud chamber. Convective andradiative heat transfer of flowing gaseous-solid suspensions. Heat transferin gas-solid fluidized beds. Gas convection and unsteady conduction influid bed heat transfer. Heat transfer between tubes and gas-solid fluidbeds. Periodic heat transfer through inhomogeneous layers.</TEXT></DOC>
