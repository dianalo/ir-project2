(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A free steak while chatting with aPenthouse Pet is just one of the factors that led truckersnationwide to tab the SOS Auto-Truck Stop one of the best truckstops in the country.   ``We listen to the truck drivers,'' said Jack Neal, marketingofficer for SOS Oil Co., which owns the truck stop. ``That's simpleand basic, but it's often ignored by retailers.''   The truck stop was picked as one of the nationi's top 50 in arecent survey of drivers by Chevron Oil Co. Chevron got about15,000 responses from a mail survey and by leaving questionaires attruck stops, giving those who responded a token gift. Truck stopswere not ranked numerically.   The SOS promotion last year, which allowed drivers withcommercial licenses to dine on free steaks while talking toPenthouse Pet Susan Napoli, drew more than 4,000 drivers a day.   Other reasons cited for the stop's popularity are good homecooking, abundant parking space and clean bathrooms _ three mustsfor truckers.   ``Their food is reasonable. We pigged out at lunch for fourbucks apiece,'' said Anne Johnson as she rested in a vinyl boothwith her driving partner and husband B.J. Johnson. ``You can't findthat in any of the other truck stops.''   The 24-hour truck stop, is easy to miss. The only sign visibleto west-bound truckers on Interstate 20 is a Phillips 66 sign with``FOOD'' underneath.   ``This is their home away from home,'' Neal said. ``They'relooking for a clean, secure environment, and we try to offer themwhat they're looking for.''   The truck stop also boasts a well-stocked convenience storewhere customers can pick up a fishing rod, a watch, underwear orsouvenir Elvis plates.   Next door is self-service gasoline and a repair shop also open24 hours.   Trucker Harold Kelley visits SOS four times a week at times inhis Peterbilt on hauls from Tennessee to Texas.   Kelley, 55, stopped Tuesday for the ice cream and coffee lunchspecial.   ``They've got hospitality here,'' Kelley said. ``I get goodservice when I come here, and I never have gotten bad food.''</TEXT></DOC>
