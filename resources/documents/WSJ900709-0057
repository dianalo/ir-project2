But 73% who know of the plan think it's a good idea thatthe 12 EC nations will remove their internal borders by late1992, the survey found. The EC's Eurobarometer pollquestioned 1,001 Washingtonians about the EC early this year.   The survey showed that 47% of Washington, D.C., residentswere aware that the EC existed. That compared with 61% ofMoscow residents. Within the EC, awareness of the communityrated 66% on average, with Danes being most aware (88%) ofthe EC but least enthusiastic about it; only 31% of Danescalled the community a &quot;good thing.&quot;   The poll found the lowest awareness of the EC in Spain(51%). Italians were most enthusiastic about the community,with 66% giving it their full endorsement.                                                                                                          WHALING BAN CONTINUES                                                                                                          The International Whaling Commission ended a conference inthe Netherlands with an agreement to continue a global ban oncommercial whaling. The agreement prompted Japan to blast theregulatory body for succumbing to environmentalist pressureand to threaten withdrawal from the commission. Japan, alongwith Norway and Iceland, had wanted the minke whale excludedfrom the ban, claiming the minke, smallest of thecommercially valuable whales, was no longer in danger ofextinction.                                                                                                          A NEW ITALIAN PLASTIC                                                                                                          Montedison S.p.A., an arm of Italy's Ferruzzi Group,announced the market launch of cornstarch-based biodegradablethermoplastic materials. The first production line forMater-Bi -- the trade name under which the materials will besold -- recently went into regular operation at a plant incentral Italy. Mater-Bi will be sold in market segments wherebiodegradability of plastic materials is valued, such ashuman hygiene and personal-health care, medical-surgical aidsand certain packaging applications.                                                                                                          HEALTH CARE IN RURAL CHINA                                                                                                          Medical care in rural China is in such short supply that500 people share a single health worker who probably hasnever had professional training, the China Daily reported. Bycontrast, six health workers serve every 1,000 urbanresidents, the newspaper said. Furthermore, 63% of themedical staff in hospitals at the township level &quot;have neverreceived regular professional education,&quot; the paper quoted anofficial of the Ministry of Public Health as saying. In anattempt to narrow the gap between urban and rural healthcare, the ministry has launched a program to emphasize thetraining of medical personnel in the countryside, theofficial said.                                                                                                          ISRAELI POLL ON GERMANY                                                                                                          Most Israeli Jews don't object to German unification,according to a poll published in the Jerusalem daily YediothAhronoth. The poll showed 36% of those asked approved of aunited Germany despite memories of Nazi Germany's murder ofsix million Jews in World War II. Thirty-five percent of the602 people questioned were indifferent about Germanunification. About 28% of those polled were unhappy aboutunification, with most saying they feared the consequences ofanother greater Germany.                                                                                                          HITACHI AGREEMENT                                                                                                          Japan's Hitachi Ltd. has reached an agreement with ChinaGreatwall Computer Group Corp. to develop software that wouldallow Chinese-made terminals to be attached to Hitachi'sgeneral-purpose computers, Hitachi officials said. A Japanesesoftware maker, Intercom Inc., is also a party to theagreement. Currently, local customers must buy Hitachiterminals to work on Hitachi's computer systems, which is adrag on sales of Hitachi general-purpose computers.                                                                                                          JAPAN TRIMS RICE SUBSIDY                                                                                                          Japan cut by 1.5% the price it will pay to rice farmersthis year.   The cut is the first in two years, but it is much lessthan some government officials were hoping for to stem U.S.criticism of Japan's rice market, which is virtually closedto imports. An earlier Ministry of Agriculture plan to cutthe price paid to farmers for their rice crops by about 5%was killed when it was opposed by members of the rulingLiberal Democratic Party, who depend heavily on farmersupport. The party had requested a freeze on the price.   Japan's government regulates and subsidizes the domesticrice market, buying much of the rice crop and reselling it toconsumers at lower prices. The subsidy cost the government311.7 billion yen (about $2 billion) in fiscal 1989.   The 1.5% reduction is expected to help cut the budget byabout nine billion yen.

Former Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev's daughter Galina wona court action for the return of a country house, aMercedes-Benz car and other valuables, a Moscow newspaperreported. The items -- including cash valued at more than$100,000 -- were confiscated when her husband, YuriChurbanov, was convicted of corruption in 1988. . . . The Seaof Galilee, which provides a third of Israel's fresh water,has dipped to the lowest level ever recorded, an Israeliwater official said. After two dry winters, Israel is facingits worst water crisis in modern times.</TEXT></DOC>
