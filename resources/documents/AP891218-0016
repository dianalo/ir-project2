These analysts were forecasting that banks' prime lending rate,to which one-third of all business and consumer loans are tied, andmortgage rates will decline in the wake of further credit easing onthe part of the Fed.   That was the prevalent view as Federal Reserve policymakersgathered today for a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee,the panel of Fed board members and regional bank presidents whomeet eight times a year to map monetary strategy.   While the meetings are held behind closed doors with the minutesof the sessions not released until six weeks later, many analystswere expecting a clear-cut signal of looser credit to emerge fromthe discussions, perhaps before the end of the week.   These economists believe the central bank will decide to reducea key interest rate, the federal funds rate, by another 0.25percentage point, dropping it from 8.5 percent to 8.25 percent.   The federal funds rate is the rate banks charge each other onovernight loans. It is the primary lever the central bank uses tocontrol short-term interet rates.   When the next easing move occurs, economists were predictingthat banks will quickly follow suit by reducing their prime lendingrates to 10 percent, down from the current 10.5 percent. Analystssaid they expected at least one more cut in the prime lending rateto 9.5 percent to occur before next summer, in response to furtherFed easing moves.   Analysts predicted that the credit easing would have abeneficial effect on mortgage rates as well.   David Wyss, an economist with DRI-McGraw Hill, predicted thatfixed-rate mortgages, currently at a national average of 9.75percent, will fall to around 9.25 percent by next summer.   Economists say they are confident in their belief that the Fedwill ease further because economic growth has slowed significantlywhile at the same time inflationary pressures have moderated.   ``It will take additional easing steps to guarantee that wedon't go into a recession,'' said David Jones, an economist withAubrey G. Lanston andamp; Co. ``I think we will avoid a recession, butjust barely.''   Jones and other economists point to the fact that unemploymenthas begun rising as various manufacturing companies from autos tocomputer firms have announced layoffs in the face of slumpingdemand.   At the same time that growth is slowing, inflationary pressuresare easing. The government announced Friday that prices at thewholesale level fell in November for the third time in the pastfive months, with the drop led by a big decline in gasoline costs.   ``Inflation has decelerated enough so that the central bank hasa margin of comfort to ease interest rates to boost economicgrowth,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Co.   That assessment is far different from the view as 1989 began. Atthat time, the central bank was in the midst of a yearlong effortto drive interest rates higher to dampen demand and keepinflationary pressure in check.   However, in May the Fed switched course and began a series ofgradual easing moves as signs mounted that economic growth wasbeginning to slow in response to the earlier credit tightening.   The Bush administration has complained that the Fed has been tootimid in its credit loosening and has brought on an undue risk of arecession. But most economists give Federal Reserve Chairman AlanGreenspan and his colleagues high marks for a delicate job ofbalancing the threats of inflation and recession.   Wyss said he believed the economy will escape without arecession and that growth will begin rebounding in the second halfof next year, at which time he predicted that the declines ininterest rates will come to an end.</TEXT></DOC>
