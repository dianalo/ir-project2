Most of the sentencewas for tax evasion, but the case sends a warning signal toother potential Western suppliers of poison-gas technology.   The case reflects a disturbing increase in attempts bysome nations to secure chemical and biological warfare (CBW)capabilities. The Cold War is thawing, or so it seems, butthere still are plenty of potential aggressors in the worldwho want to intimidate their neighbors. One means is cheap,accessible and easily camouflaged: poison gas.</LP><TEXT>   Chemical weapons have been around for a long time.Biological weapons, potentially more lethal and harder toprotect against, have come along more recently. Over the pastdecade, we have cited many times on these pages the evidenceof the use of &quot;yellow rain,&quot; most likely a Soviet-producedbiological toxin, by the Laotian and Vietnamese governmentsagainst Hmong rebels in Laos. There also is evidence that theSoviets used CBW briefly in the early stages of the Afghanwar. Iraq's use of poison gas against Iranian soldiers at onepoint in the Iraq-Iran war and more recently against Kurdishrebel forces were well-documented cases. In his interviewwith the Journal's Karen Elliot House (excerpted nearby),Iraqi President Saddam Hussein expressed his willingness touse his CBW inventories against Israel if provoked (seerelated story: &quot;On the Record: Iraq Weighs Threat of War&quot; --WSJ July 2, 1990).   There also is the risk of these deadly agents falling intoterrorist hands or being used by a national leader againstpopulated areas as a mad gesture of defiance. Acquisitions ofCBW agents are accompanied by intensified efforts to obtainballistic missile technologies, which greatly expand the areaa potential aggressor can threaten. More than a dozenless-developed countries have chemical weapons and ballisticmissiles, according to U.S. and Soviet sources.   Caging the chemical weapon is even trickier thancontaining the nuclear one. Chemical technology is relativelysimple and doesn't pose the radiation dangers inherent innuclear processing. Production is easy to disguise throughclaims that a plant is making herbicides, insecticides orfertilizers.   Plugs for the proliferation bottle have proved leaky.Negotiations for a full international convention have been inprocess since 1969, and continue in Geneva. But theimpossibility of verifying compliance casts doubt on theseand other such efforts.   One thing that the Hippenstiel-Imhausen case makes clear,however, is that it is too early to abandon Western controls,mostly under COCOM, on the export of weapons technology.Prosecution might have been harder had the Germanmanufacturer not violated German export control laws inaddition to his tax-law infringements. Responsible chemicalcompanies could perhaps further control efforts, and possiblyhead off intrusive regulation, by setting up voluntaryinspection programs. Strengthened controls on missiletechnology might help as well, although the difficulty ofstopping countries such as China from exporting rockets hasbecome evident.   Because of the verification problem, but also because oflanguor, the Western alliance has been slow to acknowledgeand try to deal with CBW proliferation. There has beeninsufficient recognition of the fact that modern technologycan make small aggressors lethal enough to be takenseriously. We hope the Hippenstiel-Imhausen case reflects animproved recognition of the threat.</TEXT></DOC>
