Union contracts with the companies and their parentcompanies in the U.S. all expire Sept. 14.</LP><TEXT>   In these pattern-setting negotiations, the union targetsone company and the contract reached with that company servesas a model for the others. The United Auto Workers in theU.S. has selected General Motors Corp. as its negotiatingtarget.   Robert White, president of the CAW, said Ford Canada, aunit of Ford Motor Co., was chosen because the company trailsGeneral Motors of Canada Ltd. on some benefits and becausethe company is in a strong financial position.   Donald McKenzie, chief negotiator at Ford Canada, said thecompany welcomes the CAW's decision. &quot;In this process ofpatterned bargaining, a settlement that ultimately is goingto evolve at this table is one that is shaped by the way ourcompany perceives issues . . . and will ultimately be anagreement that we can live with, tailored to Ford.&quot;   With the auto industry in decline, the Canadian economy ina slump and the Canadian dollar at a 10-year high against theU.S. currency, the talks aren't likely to be easy. Mr. Whitesaid they would be the &quot;most difficult (talks) since theearly 80s.&quot; He said it won't be easy to reach an agreementwith Ford Canada without a strike of the company's 12,000unionized employees.   A strike at Ford Canada's operations would have a quickripple effect on Ford Motor Co. in the U.S. The Canadiancompany is the only producer of Ford's Crown Victoria andGrand Marquis cars in North America and the only source ofV-6 engines used in Thunderbird and Lincoln models, which areproduced in U.S. plants. Parent company officials said itwould take about two weeks before U.S. operations would beaffected by a strike in Canada.   Mr. McKenzie said the company has made some preparationsin anticipation of a strike, but wouldn't discuss inventorylevels.   Dennis DesRosiers, an industry analyst, said the tone ofthe negotiations will be dictated, to a large degree, byindustry conditions. &quot;Ford's hands are, to a large degree,tied. They'll have to bargain hard -- they can't give awaythe ship,&quot; he said.   Still, industry analysts say the CAW is in a betterbargaining position than the UAW. Labor costs in Canada arelower than in U.S. plants and, although vehicle sales on bothsides of the border have slowed down, some of the Big Three'smore successful models are built in newer, more efficientassembly plants in Canada. As a result, there have beenproportionately fewer workers laid off in Canada than in theU.S.   So, while job security is the major issue in the U.S.talks, union demands in Canada are broader. The CAW said itis seeking higher wages, improved benefits and more time off.</TEXT></DOC>
