Border Checkpoints</HEAD><BYLINE>By VICTORIA GRAHAM</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>UNITED NATIONS (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Pakistan agreed Tuesday to permit moreU.N. checkpoints of military observers along the Afghan-Pakistanborder, where Kabul says illegal aid from Pakistan is flowing tothe Afghan rebels.   Pakistani envoy Iqbal Akhund told the Security Council inemergency session that Pakistan has agreed to provide a permanentpresence along the border to the U.N. Military Assistance Group ForAfghanistan and Pakistan, or UNGOMAP.   This increased presence of U.N. military observers, nownumbering only 50, repeatedly was requested by Kabul and Moscow,which allege Pakistan is violating U.N.-mediated agreements onnon-interference.   Pakistan denies the charges, but its agreement on the additionalcheckpoints is considered a minor concession. U.N. diplomats saidthey did not think it would have a significant impact.   Afghanistan, Pakistan, the United States and the Soviet Unionsigned a U.N.-sponsored agreement in April 1988 calling for thewithdrawal of Soviet troops from Afghanistan. Soviet troops enteredAfghanistan in 1979 to help the Marxist government fightU.S.-backed Moslem guerrillas, and 100,000 soldiers were in thecountry before the withdrawal.   Akhund, the prime minister's adviser on foreign affairs andnational security, said Pakistan has agreed to provide new bordercheckpoints to UNGOMAP in border areas including Chaman, Parachinarand Torkham, Nawa Pass. These are in the Northwest FrontierProvince and in Baluchistan.   Earlier, Afghanistan urged the Security Council to takeimmediate action to stop what it called Pakistan's ``full-fledgedwar'' against Kabul and to stop intervention by the Pakistan armyand militia.   Aside from more U.N. border checkpoints, it called for aninternational conference on Afghanistan, a Security Councilfact-finding mission and U.S. and Soviet efforts to persuadePakistan to stop aid to rebels.   Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil, appealing to the U.S. government,said, ``The question is why the United States, a big world power,becomes the tool for the implementation of Pakistani policies onAfghanistan. Why should the strategic interests of the UnitedStates be subdued to the expansionist designs of Pakistan in theregion?''   Pakistan, which aids the Afghan rebels, denied all allegationsof interference, massing its troops and taking part in the battlefor Jalalabad, a key city in Afghanistan.   The 15-member council was not expected to adopt any criticalresolution or take action on Afghanistan's complaint because theUnited States, which backs Pakistan, would veto any action.   It adjourned after speeches from Afghan and Pakistani envoys. Nofurther meeting was scheduled.   The other permanent council members with veto power are Britain,China, France and the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, which armsthe Kabul government against the rebels, is president of theSecurity Council this month.   Despite the withdrawal of Soviet troops in February, the UnitedStates and Pakistan continue to arm the Afghan guerrillas and theSoviet Union continues to resupply the Kabul Army. Moscow says itwill halt its arms supplies if the United States does so, but therearming continues and efforts to seek a political settlement andestablish a broad-based government have faltered.   The other council members are Algeria, Brazil, Canada, Colombia,Ethipia, Finland, Malaysia, Nepal, Senegal and Yugoslavia.</TEXT></DOC>
