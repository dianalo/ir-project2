The announcement came in a handwritten statement in Arabic froma group calling itself Islamic Jihad for the Liberation ofPalestine delivered to a western news agency in Beirut.   The statement did not identify the hostage to be freed nor set aspecific deadline for his release.   ``We shall free one of the hostages. It's a difficult decisionfor us, but we shall ascertain our good intentions and ourseriousness in this matter,'' the statement said.   ``This should be a clear signal for Washington to carry out whatit should do in the area'' to support the 10-month Palestinianuprising against the Israeli military occupation of the West Bankand Gaza Strip, the statement added.   It said the group's decision to free one hostage was designed to``win more public sympathy for the uprising of our people to wresttheir rights.''   The four hostages being held by the group are Alann Steen, 49, ajournalism teacher; Jesse Turner, 41, a professor of mathematicsand computer science; Robert Polhill, 55, a lecturer in accounting;and Indian Mithileshwar Singh, 60, a professor of finance and alegal resident alien of the United States.   They were kidnapped Jan. 24, 1987, from the campus of theU.S.-affiliated Beirut University College by gunmen posing aspolice.   The 22-line statement from Islamic Jihad was accompanied by aphotograph showing Steen and Turner with their arms around eachother and holding cigarettes.   It was the fourth statement on the four hostages since Sept. 15from the group, which is believed made up of Shiite Moslem zealotsloyal to Iran and sympathetic to Yasser Arafat's PalestineLiberation Organization.   The first statement said the kidnappers were willing to free thefour if the United States undertook an initiative in support of thePalestinian uprising.   The following two expressed dismay at the U.S. failure todeclare outright support for the Palestinian right toself-determination.   There are 17 foreigners believed held in Lebanon, including nineAmericans. Longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief MiddleEast correspondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March16, 1985.   The statement on Saturday also said: ``The Americanadministation is still denying the simplest human values toward ourpeople. We have repeatedly stated our demand in this regard and wewant public opinion and the international community to record thisAmerican precedent.   ``But in spite of everything, we are determined and shall goahead with our initiative and plan to resolve this problem.However, the continuation of progress is linked to the emergence ofnew and positive elements in the Middle East.   ``Finally, we call on the families of the hostages to come toLebanon to participate in the festivity of the release of thehostage.''   Three of the hostages' wives currently are living at the BeirutUniversity College and Mrs. Steen, now in the United States, saidshe was planning to leave Wednesday for Beirut to return to herteaching job there.   Steen's wife called the report ``the most wonderful thing in theworld.   ``I'm sitting on pins and needles right now,'' Mrs. Steen, 32,said in a telephone interview with The Associated Press in New Yorkfrom her hometown of Clark Lake, Mich.   Turner's Lebanese wife, Badr, said, ``We hope all of them aregoing to be released. ...I hope they're going to be released soon.''</TEXT></DOC>
