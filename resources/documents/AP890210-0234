Everyone involved in a leveraged buyout understands that themountain of debt incurred must be worked off. But it is a safeassumption that a large percentage has very little idea of how thatfeat can be accomplished.   In short, they rely on the future to somehow take care of things.It has worked in the past. During the 1970s, for example, inflationallowed real estate debtors to grow rich by repaying loans indiscounted dollars.   But as one corporate economist stated, those who have taken ontremendous debts to buy up corporations may not be so lucky. Theyare, he said, simply placing their faith in the Federal Reserve tosave them from default.   The future will make its decision, and it could be a painful one.But one decision doesn't await the verdict of the future. It hasbeen made painfully obvious already: Conventional bondholders havebeen damaged.   In an analysis of economic issues facing the new administration,Dun andamp; Bradstreet economist Joseph W. Duncan, observes thatbondholders _ the chief financiers of LBOs _ might very well be thepatsies.   In effect, he states, those who mastermind leveraged buyouts makethe assumption that the stock price of the company they seek isundervalued. They tender offers for the ``cheap'' stock, funding thepurchase with junk bonds.   In this manner, he continues, returns to stockholders areimmediately maximized _ but at the expense of the bondholders, whosevalues suffer for a variety of reasons:   _Because additional interest payments have to be made on the newdebt, capital meant for investment or expansion _ part of thesecurity behind bonds _ may be diverted.   The greater leverage also increases the chance of a default tobondholders when troubled economic times occur. This might causebond prices to fall and bond yields to rise, jeopardizing thefurther use of bonds as a financing tool.   _The increased supply of bonds issued by a company, and by themarket in general, reduces the attractiveness of bonds, and hencealso reduces their price.   _Whereas stockholders have the option to sell their shares to anew management, thereby avoiding future risks, bondholders have nosuch rights. They are exposed to the additional, unanticipated riskof that new management.   A leveraged buyout, for instance, means that existing bondsoutstanding are backed not by the publicly owned company that issuedthem but by a privately owned successor. The old company might havebeen solid, the new one risky.   For another, the high-risk bonds used to finance the leveragedbuyout might relegate existing, older, once high-quality bonds to``junk'' status too.   Institutional bondholders are furious about the situation,claiming their trust has been violated. Some have gone to court.Most have also gone to a somewhat unsympathetic Securities andExchange Commission.   While some answers might be forthcoming from the courts andregulators, the real impact might develop in the marketplace itself.   Having been burned so badly in bonds, that is, can bondholders,who are generally conservative individuals and institutions, beexpected to take such chances again?</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv PMs Mon, Feb 13</NOTE></DOC>
