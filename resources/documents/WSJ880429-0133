Augustine to succeed Thomas G. Pownall as chairman.    The 52-year-old Mr. Augustine, a tall and balding man with an engaging sense of humor, became vice chairman and chief executive officer of the aerospace and defense contractor in December. Mr. Pownall, 66, who is retiring, recruited Mr. Augustine about a decade ago from the Pentagon, where he was undersecretary of the Army.    Lately, Mr. Augustine's savvy about Pentagon planning methods and folkways has helped Bethesda, Md.-based Martin Marietta boost its success rate in bidding for major government contracts. The company has garnered 50% of the big contracts it targeted in the past five years, representing about 65% of their total dollar value. In both categories, the industry average is 28%.    Martin Marietta's most recent plums include designing a primary part of President Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative and making a defense system to track and destroy airplanes. In addition, the company's Titan III rocket program continues to attract more payloads for commercial satellite launches.    As chairman, Mr. Augustine will face the challenge of sustaining growth as Pentagon spending is scaled back. &quot;We're now in the process of shifting gears,&quot; he said yesterday after the company's annual meeting of shareholders.    His predecessor, Mr. Pownall, will remain a director and become chairman of the board's executive committee. It was Mr. Pownall who led Martin Marietta's almost suicidal fight to repel a takeover attempt by Bendix Corp. in the early 1980s and then boldly restructured in the aftermath of that battle. What survived was a leaner and better-focused company.    In preparing for the transition, Mr. Augustine, who remains chief executive, has further streamlined operations. For example, he established five business units that report directly to Caleb B. Hurtt, 56, president and chief operating officer. As a result, an entire layer of management has been eliminated.    But Martin Marietta's new leaders aren't expected to shake things up much more. &quot;We going to stay on a steady course,&quot; Mr. Hurtt said yesterday.    Mr. Augustine has a reputation for being neat and orderly almost to a fault. Aides say he tends to organize his work into 15-minute segments. He insists on having his phone and memo messages presorted and color-coded by priority.    When traveling, he usually carries a couple of briefcases crammed with material. Once he has worked through them, he ships them back to headquarters so secretaries can transcribe his notes and staffers can dispatch assignments.    When his own secretary was trapped once in a broken office elevator, she used the elevator car's phone to let her boss know she would be a bit late. &quot;As long as you're stuck,&quot; he replied, &quot;can you take some dictation?&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
