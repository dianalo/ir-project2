The announcement left unclear the fate of financially troubled American Savings, the nation's largest thrift, which the board has been seeking to merge into a stronger partner for many months. American Savings is the main unit of Irvine, Calif.-based Financial Corp. of America.    In a terse announcement, the board said &quot;differences ranging from the disposition of tax preferences to the amount of Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. assistance have caused us to pause and undertake a detailed review of all aspects of our negotiations with Ford.&quot; Bank Board officials gave few details about the disagreement, however.    Industry lawyers suggested the disruption may be a negotiating tactic rather than an end to the talks. Asked if negotiations might resume, a board spokesman said, &quot;I suppose there is always a possibility if there is a meeting of the minds.&quot;    The Bank Board's statement came the same day that a report was published in The Wall Street Journal saying that Dearborn, Mich.-based Ford and the bank board were close to agreement, but were divided over a demand by Ford for a guarantee that FSLIC's financial assistance will be paid even if the insurance agency is merged into another agency or succeeded by a new one.    The Bank Board spokesman said that the report spurred yesterday's statement. &quot;We wanted to clarify that this was not the only issue,&quot; he said.    However, one thrift industry official who has followed the negotiations said yesterday that he believes the impasse was prompted by Ford's request for a guarantee.    &quot;I think they broke off the talks with Ford because they reached an impasse on the guarantee issue,&quot; said the official, who declined to be identified.    American Savings has $33.5 billion in assets and 184 retail branches. But it is burdened by large amounts of delinquent loans and foreclosed property, and its losses are mounting. In the first nine months of last year, Financial Corp. had losses of $243.4 million.    Bank Board officials refused to discuss the value of financial assistance that Ford has sought, or that it has offered in the negotiations. Last September, the board estimated that Ford's proposal would cost the FSLIC $3 billion to $4.5 billion; Ford put the cost at $1.4 billion, assuming stable interest rates.    The major tax preference issue separating the parties involves the treatment of so-called &quot;net operating loss carry-forwards,&quot; the Bank Board spokesman said. Federal law allows the purchaser of an unprofitable thrift to apply the thrifts' operating losses to offset the purchaser's profits -- and hence reduce its taxes -- both for past and future years.    In federally assisted thrift takeovers, the Bank Board and potential acquirers negotiate what amount of these tax benefits the acquirers must count against FSLIC's commitment to provide financial assistance. The Bank Board spokesman said the tax benefits from acquiring American Savings would have a valued of $1.2 billion to Ford.    The breakoff of talks focused new attention on rumors that another bidder for American Savings has surfaced. For weeks, the Bank Board has refused to comment on the reports. Last year, the Bank Board's consideration of Ford's bid caused an investor group led by former Treasury Secretary William Simon to pull out of negotiations to take over the thrift.    Yesterday, the Bank Board said it continues to seek a solution &quot;that is least costly to FSLIC and maximizes the probability of success for the surviving institution.&quot;    ---   David B.
