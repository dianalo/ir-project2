Robert Freeman, a leading Wall Street strategist who bet hugesums of money on speculative takeover stocks for himself and hisvenerable employer Goldman Sachs andamp; Co., agreed this past week toquit and plead guilty to one felony fraud count for insider tradingin Beatrice Cos. shares more than three years ago.   At the same time, the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which hasorchestrated an aggressive prosecution of Wall Street corruptionstemming from the Boesky scandal, announced without explanation thatit was abandoning a probe of two other prominent traders arrestedwith Freeman in February 1987.   Those arrests, executed with extraordinary publicity by then-U.S.attorney Rudolph W. Giuliani, stunned an industry unaccustomed topolice raids, search warrants and handcuffs.   It has since become a splotch on the prosecution career ofGiuliani, who is running for New York mayor based partly on hisrecord of convictions in securities cases and other white collarfrauds.   A few months after the Freeman trio was indicted, prosecutorsdropped the charges because a judge wouldn't give them more pretrialpreparation time. Giuliani said he would bring new charges soon butnever did, leaving the three no opportunity to exonerate themselves.   Giuliani and his successor, Benito Romano, have said thegovernment may have acted prematurely in the Freeman trio arrest andprosecution, but have offered no apologies.   The government's behavior in that case reflects what many defenselawyers have called a display of sloppiness and arrogance that hasneedlessly ruined careers and reputations in the government'santi-fraud crusade.   Perhaps more important, it suggested the weakness of evidenceagainst Freeman and co-defendants, Kidder Peabody andamp; Co. traderRichard B. Wigton and former Kidder trader Timothy L. Tabor.   The case was based largely on the confessions of Martin A.Siegel, a former mergers specialist with Kidder who was implicatedin fraud by Boesky, the notorious speculator now serving a federalprison term for insider trading.   Defense lawyers have said the case against Freeman boiled down tohis word against Siegel's over whether the pair conspired to useinside information in the trading of Beatrice stock.   So it remains unclear why Freeman, after maintaining innocenceand with an apparently strong defense, chose to strike a deal andplead guilty this past week.   Freeman said in a resignation statement that he wanted to sparehis family the publicity of a trial and that he already hadsubjected them, his employer and himself to an ordeal.   But some lawyers have suggested he was motivated more by guiltyverdicts in two other cases that also stemmed indirectly from theBoesky scandal, verdicts that showed the evident willingness ofjuries to treat defendants in securities crimes harshly.   In June, a federal jury found stock speculator Paul Bilzerianguilty of securities fraud in four failed takeover attempts. Lastmonth, six securities professionals, including a friend ofFreeman's, were found guilty of fraud and the much more seriouscharge of racketeering, which carries enormous penalties.   In other business and economic news this past week:   _Government statistics suggested the economy isn't as weak aspreviously believed, nor is it growing rapidly enough to accelerateinflation. The June trade deficit narrowed to a 4{-year low andconsumer prices rose only 0.2 percent in July.   _The Securities and Exchange Commission tightened its control byadopting rules aimed at quelling penny-stock scams peddled tounwitting investors over the telephone. President Bush, meanwhile,nominated a key adviser on the thrift crisis, Richard Breeden, tobecome the new SEC chairman.   _The oil industry faced a new onslaught of litigation over theMarch 24 Exxon Corp. tanker spill in Alaska's Prince William Sound.The Alaskan government contended all oil companies operating inAlaska were negligent in their joint responsibility to preventspills.   _It was a bad week for Eastern airlines strikers but a good onefor air passengers and UAL Corp. shareholders. Eastern showed signsof strengthening its operations despite the prolonged walkout;several major airlines extended a round of fare discounting into thefall; and investor Marvin Davis's efforts to buy UAL for more than$6 billion drove its stock to record levels.</TEXT><NOTE>End adv for weekend editions Aug. 20-21</NOTE></DOC>
