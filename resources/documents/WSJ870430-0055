PS Group said Washington-based USAir has agreed to extend the acquisition deadline, which had been today, to May 17 to allow union members to ratify the agreement. The tentative accord calls for employees to relinquish certain union representation rights, in exchange for various severance benefits and protection against layoffs, a PS Group spokesman said. PS Group also has interests in jet fuel, aircraft leasing and pilot training businesses.    A spokesman for Teamsters Local 2707, which represents about 3,800 of PSA's 5,000 employees, said that while the agreement doesn't bring pay for all PSA employees up to USAir levels, it does provide for more severance benefits and related services than those initially offered. </TEXT></DOC>
