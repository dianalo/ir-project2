Chrysler Corp. said earlier this month it will pay $1.6 million to settle federal safety charges, and an H.J. Heinz Co. unit was accused of breaching plant safety rules. Union Carbide and Occidental Petroleum Corp.'s IBP unit are two of several large companies recently accused of keeping poor worker-injuries records, one of the department's most frequent charges.    While the feisty mood of the Occupational Safety and Health Administration is supported by the AFL-CIO, for instance, union officials in fact wonder whether the agency will be as tough in dealing with actual safety hazards and health violations.    Some business executives, on the other hand, suggest that OSHA's busy schedule is a reflection more of political pressures than of chronic problems in industry.    Union Carbide agreed last week to pay $408,500 to settle OSHA charges that it violated federal record-keeping rules in hundreds of instances. OSHA had originally proposed a $1.4 million fine. Union Carbide, one of the first major companies to be cited for such actions when the agency made a new round of charges last April, didn't admit guilt, but agreed to correct its injury data and to train its employees responsible for complying with OSHA's record-keeping rules. The case involves the company's chemical plants at Institute and South Charleston, W. Va.    A spokesman for Danbury, Conn.-based Union Carbide said the chemicals company hadn't violated any laws, and that the cost of settling the case was &quot;a fraction of what it would have cost to litigate&quot; it.    OSHA officials say they have been especially aggressive in pursuing companies on the record-keeping issue, because their inspectors use the records to decide which work sites need more complete reviews.    But OSHA's critics, both union officials and those at companies cited for such violations, suspect that incomplete injury data isn't the main problem the agency should address.    &quot;We agree that record-keeping is important,&quot; said Margaret Seminario, an AFL-CIO health and safety official. &quot;But safety hazards are the things that hurt and injure people, so it seems they should have at least the same level of vigor in that area.&quot;    Thomas Evans, Monsanto Co.'s director of safety and environmental health, said the chemicals and pharmaceuticals company uses its injury figures to pinpoint safety problems and take steps to avoid them. He said OSHA's reporting requirements can involve incidents that he doesn't consider work-related.    &quot;I really support their right to do what they're doing, but they need to say why record-keeping all of a sudden deserves these kinds of fines, when there are certainly greater safety problems,&quot; he said. &quot;I don't think record-keeping has anything to do with health and safety in the workplace,&quot; he added.    The assistant secretary for occupational safety and health, Charles Pendergrass, strongly disagrees. The agency uses plant records to find out where more serious problems exist, he said, so records must be accurate and complete. &quot;I find it very difficult to separate the conditions at a plant from the records. The records follow those conditions,&quot; he said. The safety agency is conducting a pilot program in Missouri and Massachusetts to determine the accuracy of such records.    But OSHA officials say their concerns about problems other than records should be evident from recent charges against Chrysler for safety hazards at its Newark, Del., plant, and from the agency's move last week to force employers to protect health-care workers from the AIDS virus.    Agency officials say the fast pace of actions will continue over the next few months. If its activity level results from congressional pressure, as some officials at the National Association of Manufacturers have suggested, that scrutiny isn't likely to end either.    &quot;There's nothing wrong with what OSHA's doing,&quot; said Sy Holzman, the deputy staff director of the House Education and Labor Committee's safety subcommittee. &quot;The only question we have is whether the big fines are just public relations to show that they're doing something. There's more concern about whether the problems are solved than how big the fines are,&quot; he added. </TEXT></DOC>
