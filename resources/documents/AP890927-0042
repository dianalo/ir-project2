The move was approved at a city council meeting Tuesday nightdespite strong opposition from members of the far-rightConservative Party who favor strict segregation.   ``We are taking a large step in South African terms,'' saidcouncil member Harold Rudolph, who voted in favor of integration.``I am so glad we are putting right that which was wrong.''   Most public facilities in major cities have been desegregated inrecent years, either informally or by the repeal of apartheidlegislation.   However, the council's decision marked the first formaldeclaration to integrate all public facilities controlled by thecity. Cape Town already has taken similiar steps.   The council's decision does not affect schools, neighborhoods orhospitals, which are segregated by national and provincial laws.Also, private facilities may be segregated under the SeparateAmenities Act.   Earlier this year, the Johannesburg city council polled whitevoters on the question of integration. Most said they approved ofdesegregated buses and recreation centers, but almost 60 percentwere opposed to opening swimming pools to blacks.   ``We know (integration) is going create problems but these aremanageable problems and we will rise to the challenge,'' saidcouncil member Ian Davidson.   The Five Freedoms Forum, an anti-apartheid group, said itwelcomed the council's decision.   ``If facilities controlled by the council can be opened, so thencan the facilities such as hospitals and schools that arecontrolled by the central and provincial governments,'' the groupsaid.   Anti-apartheid groups launched a nationwide defiance campaign onAug. 2 that has targeted segregated schools, neighborhoods,beaches, buses and other facilities.   A major demonstration is planned Saturday at beaches near CapeTown, where last month police used batons, whips and tear gas todisperse blacks who attempted to march on ``whites-only'' beaches.The beaches fall under the jurisdiction of provincial authorities,not the city council.   Johannesburg, along with Durban and Cape Town, are consideredthe most liberal cities in the country. Towns just outsideJohannesburg, such as Boksburg, have been re-imposing rigidapartheid since the Conservative Party won control of some localcouncils in municipal elections a year ago.   In Boksburg and elsewhere, blacks have been barred from publicparks and other facilities that had been integrated for severalyears.   The Johannesburg city council is controlled by the NationalParty, which has governed South Africa for 41 years and codifiedapartheid laws in the early 1950s.   President F.W. de Klerk, who was sworn into office last week,said his government seeks to end discrimination but he has notspecified any apartheid laws that he will repeal.   He also has said he favors segregated schools and neighborhoodsfor whites who want them.   Tens of thousands of blacks have moved illegally intowhites-only neighborhoods in inner cities. The government hasvirtually stopped prosecutions under the law that segregatesresidential areas and says it is considering opening someneighborhoods to all races.</TEXT></DOC>
