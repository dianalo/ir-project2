said Ken Karhuse, vice president of research atInternational Data Corp.-Washington, D.C.andP;  a subsidiary of International DataCorp. in Framingham, Mass.andM;In its effort to lure more users to its EDI offerings, IBM debuted theexpEDIte DataInterchange Series for systems ranging from PCs to mainframes.andO;The software products are geared at decreasing the time spent in manuallyprocessing and mailing business documents as well as at cutting down onbookkeeping errors.andM;Users go one-stop shopping for translator software from IBM's ApplicationSystems Division, for networking services from IBM's Information Network, andfor installation and integration support from IBM's Systems IntegrationDivision (SID).andP;  SID will also provide EDI consulting, education, systemsintegration and turnkey installation offerings.andM;DEC, too, has expressed a strong interest in the EDI market.andP;  Late last yearthe company premiered its VAX/EDI software and value-added networks inEngland, and announced plans to distribute it throughout Europe.andM;In addition, DEC is set to release specifications for its ApplicationInterface to assist developers of third-party EDI applications, officialssaid.andM;As IBM and DEC strengthen their positions, other hardware vendors--Tandem,Hewlett-Packard and Data General--are also readying EDI plans, industryanalysts said.andP;  Tandem will probably be the first of these to announceproducts, they added.andM;Shakeout or Not?andM;Although some analysts predicted a shakeout among third-party EDI softwareand services vendors as IBM and DEC move more actively into the market,others said that moves by these big players might actually open upopportunities for third parties.andM;The impact of IBM's and DEC's moves may push potential customers who had beenputting off EDI decisions, said David Taylor, director of Inter-EnterpriseSystems at the Gartner Group, a market research company in Stamford, Conn.andO;As these large industry players put more emphasis on EDI, Taylor said,companies that have not yet made a major commitment to EDI may find it saferto do so.andM;The &quot;comfort zone&quot; provided by the major vendors could create business forthe smaller players, he said.andP;  Although IBM and DEC offer &quot;first-rateproducts,&quot; Taylor said, their sales forces are still far behind their smallercompetitors in answering the business concerns of EDI customers.andM;He cited an example of a major transportation carrier that solicited EDIproduct proposals from IBM, DEC and Hewlett-Packard.andP;  According to Taylor,the staff members responsible for evaluating the proposal were &quot;personallyand professionally embarrassed&quot; for the representatives from IBM, DEC and HPbecause they misunderstood EDI technology.andM;&quot;They though of it as a technology sale, which it isn't,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;Theywere asked how this technology could be used to improve competition: 'Well,uh,' is not an adequate response.&quot;andM;The problem Taylor said, is that at large companies like IBM and DEC, thecore of EDI expertise is far removed from the sales forces out in the field.andO;Bringing this expertise to the field level will require that the accountrepresentatives undergo &quot;a remedial education&quot; that could take six months toa year, he saidandM;&quot;A 50-person company has just as much expertise as the major vendors if theyhave been in the business for five years,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;I'm not saying don't gowith the large vendors.andP;  Just make sure the account people you're dealingwith can answer your business questions as well as the technnical questions.&quot;andM;Some companies are findings that providing services rather than software isthe best way to succeed in the EDI market.andM;Service companies such as GE Information Services, McDonnell Douglas andOrdernet might be shifting their services to provide the much-needed role of&quot;facilities management,&quot; said Mark Winther, vice president of electroniccommunication services at Link Resources of New York.andM;These companies provide employee training, documentation packages andtoll-free, 24-hour consulting services.andM;Still, providing such services is expensive and requires a high volume ofcustomers, Winther said.andP;  &quot;It's a tough business to be in,&quot; he added.andM;IT might be a tough business, but third-party vendors might not beimmediately edged out, said DEC's Curt Anderson, marketing manager of theOffice and Information Systems Group.andM;&quot;As far as current suppliers, I believe in the short term their opportunitieswill continue,&quot; he said.andP;  As the market grows, there will be room for largeand small software providers, Anderson said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
