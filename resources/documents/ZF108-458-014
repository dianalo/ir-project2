the company alsoannounced a MaxFlex pricing programme to give dealers greater flexibility toconfigure the biggest selling Vectras to suit customers' needs; dealers canreduce inventory carrying costs by building systems from base models withouthard disks and adding Hewlett mass-storage and video accessories; in order toensure that dealer-configured systems cost no more than pre-configured ones,the company cut 42Mb disks 30% to $700 and 84Mbs by 21% to $1,120, and VGAboards by 20% to $400, while memory is cut 23% to $500 per megabyte;

the company identifies as core its electron devices, analyticalinstruments, semiconductor process and medical therapy equipment - but suchmoves don't come cheap and it will have to take a one-time, pre-tax charge of$74m against third-quarter results, leading to a loss; on the block are GaAsunits in Palo Alto and Santa Clara, and the Continental Electronics in Dallasand TVT Ltd, Cambridge, UK high-power transmitter building companies; thedisposals cover $200m in annual sales and employ some 1,600 people.andM;- o -andM;Odesta Corp, Northbrook, Illinois has teamed with DEC to develop electronicmail software for MS-DOS/MS-Windows, OS/2-Presentation Manager and Macintoshsystems: the aim is to develop software that conforms to X400 electronic mailstandards and enables personal computers to operate as clients to DEC'sAll-In-1 Mail Server for VMS via the graphical user interfaces.andM;- o -andM;Software Publishing Corp has licensed the technology of Atlanta-based SamnaCorp's Ami MS-Windows-based word processor;

- but disappointingly, it turns out to be tape-based: thedevice, to be the heart of E-Systems and Ampex products aimed at thesupercomputer-based mass storage market, is adapted from a 19mm helical scandigital recorder produced by Ampex for the television broadcast industry, andcan store 25Gb, 75Gb and 165Gb on small, medium and large magnetic tapecassettes; the Ampex recorder includes microprocessor control andread-after-write capabilities that enable it to operate &quot;virtually errorfree&quot;, while supporting data transfer rates of 15M-bytes per second;E-Systems is currently working with Convex Computer Corp and others todevelop the hardware and software interface to the storage device, and Ampexwill manufacture and integrate the thing into a robotically controlledstorage system that automatically loads and unloads 256 small cassettes;ships are planned for early 1992.andM;- o -andM;NCR Corp has brought its Information Imaging Systems headquarters operationback home to Dayton, Ohio from Atlanta, to give it greater access tocorporation resources.andM;- o -andM;Gigatrend Inc, US arm of the West German GigaTape Gmbh has signed DallasDigital Corp, Plano, Texas, to sell its 1Gb 4mm Digital Audio tape drivesinto the Sun Microsystems Inc and DEC computer markets.andM;- o -andM;Aldus Corp is now shipping the 4.0 release of PageMaker for the Macintosh,the one with the Story Editor built-in word processor that enables users tostay in the application to complete most of their work;

Microsoft is due to announce the thing onTuesday but there are so many copies of the thing flying around that all theenthusiasts have got their own copies to play with: word is that it's anapples and oranges comparison with Windows 2 and is not good news for AppleComputer Inc, undercutting the Macintosh II on price, performance andfunctionality - but you've got to have a big enough machine, an 80386preferably with a 20MHz clock and a minumum of 4Mb of memory, because thething sets up the first 16Mb of main memory and disk space as main memory,and anything smaller, it spends its whole time swapping; a cache is also abig help; one of the best features over Windows 2 is that it's far easier toinstall - people are said to be loading it and running intuitively withouthelp of manual - there are far more copies of the software than manuals outthere; bad news for Lotus Development Corp is that Windows 3 makes theMicrosoft Excel spreadsheet - already well regarded - look a whole lotprettier; one or two bugs appear to have carried over from Windows 2, such asthe fact that it sometimes gets its buffers mixed up, so that when you createa bit of text, you find it's added it to your spreadsheet; but the consensusseems to be that it's the future, and it almost works.andM;- o -andM;IBM must be beginning to wonder whether it made the right decision indeciding not to come out with its own alternative to Storage TechnologyCorp's Automated Cartridge System for 3480-type tape drives: the thing looksso attractive to the rest of the world that DEC has offered to help theLouisville, Colorado to develop an interface and software to link the 4400 toits VAX and VAXcluster systems; the 4400 enables users to store and retrieveas much as 19,000Gb; 1,400 have now been sold.andM;- o -andM;Lotus Development Corp and Novell Inc have agreed to extend their letter ofintent to merge, which was to have run out last Tuesday, until today - butthe hold-up is thought to relate to the junior roles assigned to top Novellstaffers in the original plan, and not to the share exchange price agreed,which was widely criticised for not offering any premium for control ofNovell passing to Lotus.andM;- o -andM;Manchester City Council is to set up The Manchester Host, an electronic mailand database access network for the region: according to the Financial Times,the network, with subscription rate set at #20 to #25 a month, will be run bySoft Solution, the co-operative that manages the UK end of the GeoNetelectronic mail system; the UK government is putting up #300,000 to helpfinance the start-up costs.andM;- o -andM;At its annual general meeting yesterday Pandamp;P Plc signed a distributionagreement with DEC to distribute the latter's microcomputer products: themarketing of this DEC kit will be handled by Pandamp;P's newly ac-quired Unixcompany Perrin Systems Ltd (CI No 1,419), which now trades under the name Pandamp;PPower Systems.andM;- o -andM;ICL is becoming a major player on the Spanish market, and its ICL Espana SAunit has signed a distribution agreement with the Spanish company GrupoInformatico Commercial SA, based in southern Madrid.andM;- o -andM;The job of the disk jockey is not particularly arduous, but there is stillthat fiddly business of finding the cassette with the right commercial on itand loading it into the machine - but that task has now been de-skilled too,says the Wall Street Journal: a Lenexa, Kansas firm, Computer Concepts Inchas a $22,000 personal computer-based system that enables radio stations tostore all their commercials and jingles in digital form on hard disk andenable them to be scheduled, and played at the touch of a button - withenhanced fidelity.andM;- o -andM;Novell Inc has licensed MIPS Computer Systems Inc to market Portable NetWareon its Unix servers: when the product becomes available in late 1990, MIPSwill market it to its OEM and reseller customers - the likes of Control DataCorp, Nixdorf Computer AG and TIS Ltd here, as a software option on the MIPSRISComputer product line, and Novell and MIPS will conduct joint sales andmarketing activities for the thing.andM;- o -andM;Unisys Canada Ltd has a $3.8m order to supply U6000 series Unix machines toretailer K Mart Canada for back office applications: the company's 120 storesacross Canada will each get one of the machines and the order includes 12080386-based U 6000/55s and 390 graphics terminals; the order follows the onefor 3,500 U-series machines from K Mart in the US last year.andM;- o -andM;Real-time expert system software house Gensym Corp, Cambridge, Massachusetts,has formed a European subsidiary - Gensym GmbH will be based in Munich, WestGermany.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
