Almost all presidential candidates -- Nixon, Carter, Reagan, even John Kennedy -- run against &quot;Washington&quot; or the &quot;system,&quot; codewords for an establishment thought to be out of touch with the real America. Each new campaign is proclaimed a crusade to liberate the land from the foolish policies of the predecessor president. It is as if the U.S. is in perpetual revolution.    ---   Richard J. Bloomfield, former ambassador to Portugal and Ecuador, speaking to the World Peace Foundation in May:    A little hypocrisy is not always a bad thing in diplomacy; but a hypocrite is not a cynic. A cynic knows that what he says publicly about his motives is false; a hypocrite, in contrast, is not conscious of the discrepancy between what he says and what he wants. By and large, Americans are not cynical, so when we are hypocritical about our foreign-policy objectives, we tend to delude ourselves. </TEXT></DOC>
