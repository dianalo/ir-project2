The organization alleges in a lawsuit filed in U.S. DistrictCourt that members of Operation Rescue plan to illegally harass andintimidate patients and employees at abortion clinic demonstrationsscheduled to begin Nov. 10 in the Washington, D.C., area.   NOW seeks a preliminary injunction to prohibit ``trespassing on,sitting in, blocking, impeding or obstructing ... any facility''offering abortions, family planning or gynecological services.   If a court order is issued, Operation Rescue will proceed withits plans, said members of the organization, an evangelicalChristian group with an estimated 35,000 supporters that hasdemonstrated at abortion clinics around the country.   ``We will be in Washington in November,'' Susan Odom ofOperation Rescue told a news conference when asked about NOW'scourt case. A preliminary injunction is in effect against OperationRescue in Broom County, N.Y., prohibiting the group fromtrespassing at two medical facilities or harassing visitors. Asimilar court order is in effect in Palm Beach County, Fla., saidOperation Rescue attorney Kyndra Mulder, who said it ``has had noeffect'' at three subsequent demonstrations.   ``I am tired of listening to my sisters in the NationalOrganization for Women accuse me of violence,'' Odom said. She saidmembers of Operation Rescue have ``remained passive'' while NOW and``their belligerent henchmen'' have assaulted ``rescuers sitting onthe ground.''   The lawsuit said that Operation Rescue's activities have closedclinics where abortions are performed and that the group has``intimidated and harassed patients and employees of the clinics.''   NOW is asking U.S. District Court Judge Louis Oberdorfer to fineOperation Rescue $25,000 a day if the group violates anypreliminary injunction the judge might issue in the case.   In the last year, there have been more than 500 arrests as aresult of Operation Rescue's actions at the Hillcrest Women'sSurgi-Center in Washington, D.C., and at the Commonwealth Women'sClinic in Virginia.   The suit says that a group called the Veterans Campaign for Lifeplans disruptions at abortion and family planning facilities onVeterans Day weekend. The Veterans Campaign is affiliated withOperation Rescue and is one of the 10 organizations and individualsagainst whom the suit is filed.   Joining NOW in the suit are Planned Parenthood of MetropolitanWashington and eight other groups, including the Virginia andMaryland state chapters of NOW and the Hillcrest and Commonwealthclinics.</TEXT></DOC>
