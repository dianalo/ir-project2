M. Danny Wall, chairman of the Federal Home Loan Bank Board,urged Congress to delve into the history of the deposit insurancesystem before deciding whether or not to spend taxpayer dollars torescue the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp., whichguarantees Sandamp;L deposits up to $100,000.   Wall told the U.S. League of Savings Institutions on Thursdaythat Congress, in setting up the deposit insurance system, set thepremiums charged to financial institutions high enough to cover onlynormal losses, not catastrophic losses.   An actuarial study at the time showed that, to cover all futurelosses, premiums would have had to have been set nearly four timeshigher than they were originally, Wall said.   Some of Wall's listeners concluded he was implying that Congressshould help the industry pay the bill, but Wall said, ``I'm nottaking that step.''   ``I'm not saying what the solution is at this point, I'm justtrying to set a historical basis,'' he said, promising to presentthe bank board's recommendations after the election.   Regulators estimate it will cost $45 billion to $50 billion tocover the industry's red ink.   The new chairman of the league, B.R. Beeksma, said healthy Sandamp;Lscan't bear the cost of bailing out their insurance fund withoutfalling into insolvency themselves.   Deregulation promoted by the Reagan administration and sought bythe industry allowed many Sandamp;Ls in the early 1980s to raise interestrates offered to depositors and venture into new kinds of loanarrangements. But many underwrote highly speculative and ultimatelydisastrous loans, often in real estate, and as of midyear 497 of thenation's 3,048 Sandamp;Ls were listed as insolvent. Another 408 weresolvent but losing money.   Now, the industry that fought so hard for deregulation in theearly 1980s says government should have regulated it more, and it iscalling for a return to many of the controls of the past.   Beeksma, as part of what he called the industry's ``never-againagenda,'' said Sandamp;Ls will accept a clampdown on the kinds of laxregulation that contributed to the red ink.   ``I can promise you that the U.S. League will be vigorous in itspursuit of tighter regulation and supervision,'' he said.   Beeksma, chairman of InterWest Savings Bank in Oak Harbor, Wash.,replaces Theo H. Pitt Jr., a North Carolina thrift executive whoserved as league chairman for the past year.   The trade group also appointed Frederick L. Webber as its newpresident, the top staff position. Webber is a former assistantsecretary of the Treasury in the Ford administration and formerWhite House aide under Richard Nixon. He most recently was presidentof the National Soft Drink Association.   He replaces William B. O'Connell, who has held the post since1979.   O'Connell, in his outgoing address, warned the Sandamp;L executivesagainst a ``division that seems to be developing over the resolutionof the problems'' of the FSLIC.   O'Connell said after the speech he was referring to tensionbetween healthy and struggling Sandamp;Ls. Some healthier Sandamp;Ls are tryingto leave the FSLIC and join the commercial bank insurance fund, theFederal Deposit Insurance Corp., which charges lower premiums.Ailing institutions that can't qualify for FDIC membership resentthat.</TEXT></DOC>
