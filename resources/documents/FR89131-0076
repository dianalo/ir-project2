This document specifically describesand addresses possible remedial alternatives to clean up the sale propertylandfill. The landfill was identified in the 1987 remedial investigationat Hamilton AFB as a site containing soil and refuse that, in some locations,exceeds criteria developed by the State of California for identificationof hazardous waste.   The Draft Feasibility Study major findings include:   Landfill 26 presents insignificant health risks (both toxic and carcinogeniceffects) to persons currently living or working at Hamilton AFB.   Left in its current condition, Landfill 26 will continue to pose no threatto human health. Development of Landfill 26 for residential or other restricted-usepurposes requires extensive remediation within guidelines determined byFederal and State regulatory agencies to assure protection of human health.  The Draft Feasibility Study describes eight remedial alternatives for addressingcontamination in the soil/refuse. These alternatives range from no action(requiring continued groundwater monitoring) to excavation and disposalof contaminated soil/refuse in appropriate commercial landfills and rangein costs from $2.8 million to $53.5 million. The following eight remedialalternatives were identified:   No Action_No clean up actions taken at the landfill. Continued groundwatermonitoring at the site would be necessary to establish and record thatleachate is not moving off site. Cost is $2.8 million. Time frame is 30years of monitoring.   Excavation and Disposal in a Commercial Landfill_All material equalingor exceeding State levels defining a hazardous waste would be removed fromthe site and transported to an off-site commercial Class I landfill. Materialsnot exceeding hazardous levels would be removed and transported to an off-sitecommercial Class II landfill. Excavated material would be replaced withclean fill. Cost is $53.5 million. Time frame is 2 years.   Closure in Place as Class I Landfill_ The site would be closed where itis as a Class I hazardous waste landfill. No material would be removed.A engineered cap would be placed over the landfill to prevent erosion andwater infiltration. A slurry wall would be placed around the landfill tocontrol groundwater flow in and out of the landfill. Public access wouldbe restricted. Cost is $10.6 million. Time frame is less than 2 years.  Fixation of Hazardous Material, Closure as a Class II Landfill_ Materialequaling or exceeding State levels defining hazardous waste would be excavatedand mixed with materials such as Portland cement to fix and bind the contaminants.These fixed materials would be redeposited into the landfill. The sitewould then be capped and closed as a Class II landfill. This closure wouldrequire a variance permit from the California Department of Health Services.Cost is $13.2 million. Time frame is 3 years.   Excavation of Hazardous Waste and Closure as a Class II Landfill_All materialequaling or exceeding hazardous definition levels would be excavated andremoved to an off-site commercial Class I landfill. An engineered cap wouldbe constructed on the landfill and the site would be closed as a ClassII landfill. Cost is $30.9 million. Time frame is 2.5 years.   Soil Washing and Closure as a Class II Landfill_All material equaling orexceeding hazardous definition levels would be excavated and processedover a period of 4 years in an above ground washing system to remove metalsand pesticides. Cleaned material would be redeposited in the landfill area.The washing solution would be treated and recycled into the washing system,then treated and discharged either to the Novato Sanitary District or nearbysurface waters. The site would be closed as a Class II landfill. Cost is$19.4 million.   Biological Treatment and Excavation and Commercial Landfill Disposal ofHazardous waste_All material equal or exceeding hazardous definition levelswould be excavated and disposed on an off-site commercial Class I Landfill.Petroleum product-contaminated soil exceeding 100 parts per million (mg/kg)would be excavated and treated on site in a land farm operation that wouldallow naturally occurring micro-organisms to feed on the petroleum andreduce the contamination. This material would then be removed and, withother material not exceeding definition levels, would be disposed in aClass III landfill. Cost is $39.4 million. Time frame is 7 years.   Fixation and Class I Closure of Landfill_All material equaling or exceedinghazardous definition would be excavated and fixed with material such asPortland cement. This material would be redeposited into the landfill area.An engineered cap would be constructed, and a slurry wall constructed aroundthe landfill area. Security would be required. Cost is $15.7 million. Timeframe is 3.5 years.   Remediation of soil/refuse will subsequently require localized groundwaterremediation at the landfill. The Draft Feasibility Study describes sixgroundwater remedial alternatives utilizing various processes ranging incost from $4.7 million to $18 million.   The Corps of Engineers has been conducting environmental investigationof the sale property at Hamilton AFB since May, 1985. To date, clean upactions on the sale property have included removal of containerized hazards(1985) and removal of 65 underground fuel structures (1986). Total costexpenditure for the Hamilton AFB clean up and investigations to date hasbeen $13.8 million.   Copies of the Draft Feasibility for Landfill 26 will be available on 9January 1989. At that time, copies may be obtained by calling the SacramentoDistrict Corps of Engineers, (916) 551-2254, or by writing the SacramentoDistrict Corps of Engineers, ATTN: CESPK-ED-M, 650 Capitol Mall, Sacramento,California 95814-4794. A limited number of copies of the study will alsobe available at the Hamilton Army Airfield Installation Manager's Office,Building No. 501, Hamilton Army Airfield.   Due to its large size, the remedial investigation report for the landfillreferenced in the feasibility study, as well as a copy of the feasibilitystudy, is available for review by the public at the following locations:<ITAG tagnum="15">Marin County Library, Civic Center, San Rafael, California   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Santa Rosa City Library, Main Branch, Santa Rosa, California   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Building 501, Hamilton Army Airfield, Novato, California   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">6th Army Public Affairs Office, Bldg. 38, Presidio of San Francisco,San Francisco, California   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="15">Presidio of San Francisco Public Affairs Office, Bldg. 37, Presidioof San Francisco, San Francisco, California</ITAG>A public meeting to discuss the environmental investigations at Hamiltonand receive public comment on the landfill feasibility study is scheduledfor February 17, 1989.
