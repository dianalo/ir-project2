Today,this 80-year-old political veteran warns that another civilwar will produce only losers and could spread beyondYugoslavia's borders.   Marshal Josip Tito's former right-hand man -- but later anoutspoken critic of communism -- Mr. Djilas says he stillhopes war can be avoided. During the last savage conflictbetween Serbs and Croats during World War II, a millionpeople died, not counting those who fell fighting the Germanand Italian invaders.</LP><TEXT>   But as violence and political grandstanding grows morestrident, Mr. Djilas (pronounced JEE-las) grows morepessimistic. The federal army seems unable to quell thefighting between Serb and Croat militia groups in easternCroatia. And political leaders are whipping the populationinto a frenzy of anger and mutual recrimination, revivingage-old feuds and nationalist myths.   &quot;Civil war in Yugoslavia has already begun,&quot; says Mr.Djilas, adding that he hopes it can be confined, as now, to afew border regions and hot spots.   A civil war won't be a disaster just for Yugoslavia, hesays, but would threaten European and even global stability.He contends that Yugoslavia's neighbors, like it or not, willfind themselves involved. Albania would press its claims fora unified Albanian state, helping that repressed populationin Kosovo to rise against their Serbian masters.German-speaking nations would help Slovenia and Croatia,while France and Italy would fret about such collaboration.Muslim states would intervene to help the Muslims in Bosnia.   &quot;This war would be at once internationalized. Yugoslaviawould split Europe,&quot; he says.   Living in a modest, mid-town Belgrade apartment, Mr.Djilas remains a respected authority on the byzantinepolitics of Yugoslavia. He spent three years in jail in the1930s for criticizing Yugoslavia's then-royalist regime. Hewas incarcerated for most of 10 years after 1957, when hisdamaging critique of corruption and abuses of communism, &quot;TheNew Class,&quot; was smuggled out of the country and published.Another work that deeply embarrassed the Tito regime was&quot;Conversations with Stalin,&quot; published in 1962.   Since then, he has continued his activism for free speechand human rights. Wearing faded jeans and a plaid shirt, hesits on the edge of a faded velour chair, his carved facesurrounded by abundant, snow-white hair.   Mr. Djilas says most Yugoslavs don't want a war and arebeing manipulated by a fanatical minority, including many ofthe country's current leaders, who he says don't know when tostop or how to back down gracefully. The federal governmentand army are too weak and divided to have much influence, andsome of their actions, such as the army's heavy-handed moveinto Slovenia on June 27, have only made matters worse, hesays.   He thinks the country should be focusing its energies oneconomic reform, rather than power politics, and easing therepressive policies that in some areas have survived the oldregime.   &quot;Everybody here thinks not about how we would live butabout who would be the strongest,&quot; he says. &quot;Still medieval,futile.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
