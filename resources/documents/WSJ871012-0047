Analysts and US Sprint employees have expected the announcement for several weeks. US Sprint, a long-distance telephone joint venture between GTE Corp. and United Telecommunications Inc., plans to consolidate its seven divisions into three, eliminating certain staff jobs. But one executive said many employees whose positions will be cut will return to jobs at Stamford, Conn.-based GTE and Kansas City, Mo.-based United Telecommunications. The joint venture currently employs between 13,000 and 14,000 people, a spokesman said.    Analysts expect that the reorganization will centralize certain marketing and sales functions and result in new job assignments for some executives. Ed Carter, senior vice president for marketing and sales, will concentrate on advertising and marketing for small business and residential customers, one analyst close to the company said. David M. Holland, an executive vice president, will assume some responsibity for marketing to large businesses, one company source said.    The reorganization is the latest change being made by US Sprint's president, Robert H. Snedaker, who succeeded Charles M. Skibo last July. Mr. Snedaker is emphasizing cost control, and some executives have left the company.    Dory Munder, vice president, customer service, is planning to depart, US Sprint executives have said, in part because she has been commuting to US Sprint headquarters in Kansas City from New York City. Ms. Munder was recruited a year ago by Mr. Skibo from American Express Co. to overhaul US Sprint's customer service centers.    US Sprint, which touts itself as the phone company with fiber optic lines, has racked up huge losses and had a slew of operational problems. The company hasn't been able to bill customers correctly, post payments to accounts on time, or staff customer service centers well enough to quickly resolve customer complaints. Mr. Snedaker's chief task has been to correct these problems. </TEXT></DOC>
