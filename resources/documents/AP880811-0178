Most of the refugees seeking a return trip _ about 70 _ havecome forward in the past week, since Hong Kong opened talks withHanoi about large-scale repatriation, said the spokeswoman, whospoke on condition of anonymity. Vietnam has said it is ready totake back refugees who want to return.   After the Vietnam War ended in 1975, Hong Kong considered allVietnamese arriving by boat as political refugees eligible forresettlement in third countries.   An estimated 23,000 refugees have come to this tiny Britishcolony, whose 5.5 million people already are crowded in the20-square-mile enclave. Hong Kong, with its active businesscommunity, is on the southeastern coast of China about 500 milesfrom Vietnam's northern border.   A new policy took effect in Hong Kong on June 16 to curb thesurging number of arrivals. It labels all incoming Vietnamese asillegal immigrants subject to repatriation except those who canprove that persecution drove them from communist Vietnam.   Despite the new rules, about 7,000 Vietnamese boat people havesailed into Hong Kong since mid-June, and Hong Kong has beenpacking most of them into temporary detention centers.   The government spokeswoman said some of those who requestedrepatriation were classified as illegal immigrants. But she saidothers were classified as refugees entitled to be resettled.   She said she had no further details.   Only 21 boat people have been voluntarily repatriated from HongKong since 1978, including two in July.   Officials of Hong Kong and Vietnam met in Hanoi on Aug. 3-4 todiscuss repatriations. No agreement was reached, but more talkswere expected.   The repatriation applications of the 90 volunteers will beforwarded to the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees for discussionwith Hanoi. U.N. officials could not be reached immediately forcomment.</TEXT></DOC>
