Sues To Make Insurer Pay For Clean-Up Costs </HL><SO> </SO><CO> TIC ALD </CO><IN> ENV FIN INS </IN><DATELINE> MORRIS TOWNSHIP, N.J.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   Allied-Signal Inc. filed suit to establish its insurance carrier's obligation to pay for potential environmental damage claims.    The suit was filed in New Jersey Superior Court after Travelers Insurance Co., one of Allied-Signal's insurers, asked a Maryland court to rule environmental damage claims outside its coverage.    In addition to seeking reimbursement for claims Allied has already paid, the suit wants insurers to pay for all expected claims. &quot;We want the court to define the coverage with respect to all carriers,&quot; said Michael L. Rodburg, attorney for Allied-Signal. A spokesman for the aerospace, automotive products and engineered materials company said the suit is also meant to pre-empt similar action by other insurers.    In recent years, litigation between insurers and corporations over environmental claim damages has become common as federal and state agencies have intensified efforts to clean up hazardous waste.    Most federal and state agency claims against corporations have been for cleanup costs, notes Deeohn Ferris, an attorney for the American Insurance Association. Usually, the corporations have attempted to pass such costs on to their insurers. But, Ms. Ferris added, policies under which such claims are made specifically exclude pollution exposures. Insurers don't view cleanup costs as property damage as defined in the policy, she added.    Travelers Insurance is a unit of Travelers Corp. </TEXT></DOC>
