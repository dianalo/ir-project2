Section 201 created the Flexible Subsidy program to provide operating assistancefor projects experiencing extreme financial difficulty. Operating assistanceis generally provided in the form of a deferred loan and, in conjunctionwith other resources, is designed to restore or maintain the physical andfinancial soundness of eligible projects so as to maintain their low- andmoderate-income character. Assistance can be used to fund operating deficits,such as delinquent tax escrows or inadequate reserve accounts, and to correctpast deficiencies in maintenance, repairs, and capital replacements.The 1983 amendments expanded the scope of HUD-assisted projects that wereeligible for operating assistance under the program. The 1987 amendmentsagain added new types of projects that are eligible for Flexible Subsidy,and they added a loan program for projects assisted by HUD that have aneed for capital improvements that cannot be financed from their reservefunds. These loans (as well as the operating assistance loans) are to befunded from a Flexible Subsidy Fund established in the U.S. Treasury. ThisFund is comprised of excess receipts paid to HUD from owners of projectsassisted under section 236 of the National Housing Act, any appropriationsmade for this purpose, and repayments of operating assistance or loansmade under the Flexible Subsidy program. Repayment of capital improvementloans will commence after completion of the work covered by the loan andwill continue throughout the loan term_usually until the end of the originalproject mortgage.Section 1011 of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988(Pub. L. No. 100-628, approved November 7, 1988) now requires that HUDimplement the capital improvement loan component of the program, at a statedminimum annual funding level, by issuing ``regulations that become effectivenot later than February 5, 1989.'' Consequently, this rule is being issuedto implement the current section 201, including the 1983, 1987 and 1988changes.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES: </T2><T3>Effective date: </T3>March 8, 1989. <T3>Comment date: May 7, 1989. </T3></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESS: </T2>Interested persons are invited to submit comments regardingthis rule to the Rules Docket Clerk, Office of the General Counsel, Room10276, Department of Housing and Urban Development, 451 Seventh StreetSW., Washington, DC 20410.

Statutory Background</ITAG>The 1983 amendments to section 201 (made by section 217 of the Housingand Urban-Rural Recovery Act of 1983) expanded the Flexible Subsidy programto include projects assisted under section 8 of the United States HousingAct of 1937 that had been converted from assistance under section 236 ofthe National Housing Act or section 101 of the Housing and Urban and DevelopmentAct of 1965, and clarified that a project need not have an FHA-insuredmortgage to be eligible.The 1987 changes (made by sections 185 and 186 of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Act of 1987) again expanded the category of eligible projects.Projects assisted under section 23 of the United States Housing Act of1937 as it existed before January 1, 1975, and projects that received aloan under section 202 of the Housing Act of 1959 more than 15 years beforethe date on which assistance is to be made available under this program,were made eligible.The principal thrust of the 1987 amendments, however, was to create a newcategory of assistance to be provided under the Flexible Subsidy programfor projects that need capital improvements to achieve physical soundnessthat cannot be funded from project reserve funds without jeopardizing othermajor repairs or replacements that are reasonably expected to be requiredin the near future. This program of capital improvement loans is to befunded at an annual minimum of $30 million or 40 percent of the amountavailable (whichever is less), to the extent of approvable applications.The 1987 amendments contemplate a contribution from the project owner towardthe capital improvements of at least 20 percent of the total estimatedcost. HUD may require the contribution to be as much as 30 percent of thecost, if that action is necessary to keep the rent burden required to servicethe loan down to a reasonable level. The cost for capital improvementsto be made under this loan program is limited to the amount HUD determinesto be necessary to repair or replace capital items that have failed orare likely to fail in the near future, to improve those items and associateditems to meet HUD's cost-effective energy efficiency standards, and tosatisfy requirements under section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973for access by mobility-impaired persons.The 1987 amendments specify priorities to be given in awarding capitalimprovement loans. Top priority is given to projects where the owner isseeking to prepay the mortgage and the project is eligible for incentivesto continue operating for the benefit of low- and moderate-income tenantsunder section 224(b) of the Emergency Low Income Housing Preservation Actof 1987. Other projects are to be given priority to the extent (1) thecapital improvements are immediately required; (2) the project serves lowerincome families and other suitable housing is unavailable in the area;(3) the capital improvements involve life, safety, or health of the projectresidents; and (4) the project demonstrates the greatest financial distressbut can be rendered physically sound. In any case, the owner must agreeto maintain the low- and moderate-income character of the project at leastuntil the expiration of the project mortgage.The 1987 amendments also specify that the interest rate on the loan isto be established by the Secretary of HUD. It is to be not less than 3percent nor more than 6 percent (unless a rate of as low as 1 percent isneeded to sustain acceptable rents), and is to be based on a point spreadbelow the Treasury rate, plus an allowance established by the Secretaryto cover administrative costs and probable losses. The term of the loanmay not exceed the remaining term of the original mortgage. The Secretaryis also authorized to impose additional conditions determined to be appropriate.Recognizing that a project may need considerable assistance, the 1987 amendmentsprovide that a project may receive more than one loan or other assistanceunder the Flexible Subsidy program. Those amendments also provide thatif the debt service on a capital improvement loan would otherwise forcethe rents too high, the owner contribution can be required to be higheror the rate of interest on the loan can be lower, as discussed above. Otherways stated in the statute to resolve the high rent burden problem areto provide Section 8 Existing Housing assistance or to increase the lengthof the loan term.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Changes to Regulation</ITAG>Part 219 is reorganized and revised in this rulemaking. Three subpartshave been created to group the provisions in a logical order. General provisionsthat apply both to the existing Flexible Subsidy program of operating assistanceand the new Flexible Subsidy program of capital improvement loans havebeen placed in Subpart A. Provisions that apply only to the operating assistancecomponent have been placed in Subpart B, and provisions dealing principallywith the capital improvement loan component have been placed in SubpartC.A. Subpart AThe sections now placed in Subpart A include andSection;219.101, Purpose;andSection;219.105, Types of projects; andSection;219.110, General eligibility;andSection;219.120, Local government consultation; and andSection;219.130,Waivers. These sections correspond to existing sections with the same numbers,except for Local government consultation and Waivers, which used to beandSection;andSection;219.115 and 219.135, respectively.The purpose section, based on section 201(a) of the Housing and CommunityDevelopment Amendments of 1978 (HCD Amendments of 1978 or ``section 201''),has been revised by deleting the reference to use of assistance under thispart for supplemental funding for Rent Supplement contracts, since section201(h) prohibits such use after October 1, 1981. It also adds referenceto the capital improvement loan component of the Flexible Subsidy program,a 1987 Act change.Both the purpose section and the following section on types of eligibleprojects have been revised to reflect the addition of several categoriesof projects: certain Section 8 projects, Section 23 (precursor to Section8) projects, certain Section 202 projects, and all of the eligible categorieswithout regard to whether they have FHA-insured mortgages.The section that described conditions for approval has been renamed generaleligibility. The paragraph on supplemental funding for Rent Supplementcontracts has been deleted from this section, as it was from the purposesection. The paragraph on funding priorities has been moved to a sectionin Subpart B. The remaining paragraph, based on section 201(d) of the HCDAmendments of 1978, has been revised to reflect the 1987 amendments thatadded physical soundness to financial soundness as a goal to be supportedby the Flexible Subsidy program. As modified, the eligibility criteriaapply to both operating assistance loans and capital improvement loans,and therefore this section is left in the general subpart. It should benoted that one of the eligibility criteria is that this type of assistanceis less costly than other methods of preserving the project as a housingresource for low- to moderate-income tenants. This criterion is interpretedto include consideration of the Department's possible future costs if theproject were to fail, the owner default under the mortgage, and the mortgagebe assigned to the Secretary for payment of a mortgage insurance claim.The section on contact with local government, based on section 201(e),has been renamed Local Government Consultation rather than Local GovernmentAssurances, to emphasize the process instead of the result. Again, thereference to supplemental funding for Rent Supplement contracts has beenremoved. The section is otherwise unchanged.A section has been added to discuss the source of funds for the FlexibleSubsidy program, consistent with the authorization of the Flexible SubsidyFund by section 201(j), as added by the 1987 amendments. This section ofthe rule provides that available funds are allocated annually for two categoriesof projects: (1) State agency financed non-insured projects, and (2) allothers, including projects with FHA-insured and HUD-held mortgages. Theallocations are made based on the number of units in potentially eligibleprojects of the category as a percentage of the total number of units inall potentially eligible projects. This allocation is made because HUDgenerally allocates money separately for State agency-administered HUDprograms that do not involve FHA mortgage insurance, and making this allocationat the beginning of each year allows them to plan the use of the money.Once these two funding categories are established, each must comply withthe statutory requirements to spend its proportion of $30,000,000 or 40percent of its allocation, whichever is less, for the capital improvementloan program, to the extent of approvable applications.Funding decisions on project applications are made on a quarterly basisusing the applicable priorities enumerated in Subparts B and C. As theend of each fiscal year approaches, HUD will determine to what extent thereare funds to be used for capital improvement loans that are allocated foreach of the major categories that are likely to be unused. In the lastquarter, to the extent there is to be an excess in either of the categoriesfor capital improvement loans that could be used for such loans to eligibleapplicants of the other category, the funds will be reallocated to thatcategory.Another new section has been added to cover HUD's environmental responsibilitieswhen a capital improvement is involved, whether funded under Subpart Bor Subpart C. The type of repair and replacements anticipated to be approvedunder this rule will be sufficiently limited in scope and expense so thatevaluation of each proposal will not be required under the National EnvironmentalPolicy Act of 1969. (See the categorical exclusion for limited rehabilitationstated in 24 CFR 50.20(c)). However, some applications for funding mayinvolve either a project location or a type of improvement that will triggerHUD review under another environmental protection statutes.  Improvements to major mechanical systems will trigger HUD review to determinewhether the project is located in a floodplain and if so, whether specialaction should be taken to minimize damage to the systems from possibleflooding. If the project is listed on the National Register of HistoricPlaces, the proposal will be reviewed for compliance with the NationalHistoric Preservation Act of 1966. Exertior alterations that are not virtuallyidentical replacements (``in-kind'') will trigger review under the Actfor unlisted projects located in an historic district.  Strict adherence with the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966 wouldrequire that inquiry be made to the State Historic Preservation Officer(SHPO) concerning every property for which funds are requested to covercaptial improvements to determine whether the property is ``eligible for''inclusion on National Register. This process might involve submission ofdocumentation concerning the project to the SHPO and awaiting a formaldetermination of eligibility, under the then-prevailing standards of whatis historic. The Department has concluded that following such a procedurein every case would interfere with its duty to administer the capital improvementloan program in accordance with its purposes, because of the emergencynature of the program and the concern that these projects not be allowedto deteriorate irretrievably. Consequently, the Department is consultingwith the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation to pursue the possibilityof recognizing an exemption from the requirement to discover whether everyproperty that is to be funded for capital improvements is ``eligible for''listing on the National Register. In the meantime, the rule provides forinquiry to determine whether each property actually is listed and for reviewof the proposed improvements to any listed property to assure compliancewith the Act.  The emergency nature of the capital improvement loan program operated underSubpart C is evident in the statutory listing of the priorities to be usedin making funding decisions. Top priority is to be given for major repairsor replacements of capital items in projects that are eligible for incentivesnot to prepay their mortgates, as described in section 224(b) of the EmergencyLow Income Housing Preservation Act of 1987, to retain these projects inthe inventory of housing stock available for low- or moderate-income families.Otherwise priority is to be given to projects with immediate need of repairs,where the repairs are needed to preserve the health and safety of theirtenants, to save the housing where other low rent housing is unavailablefor the tenants. (See section 201(k)(4).) Therefore, the rule's procedureprovides for assuring that funding decisions can be made in a manner consistentwith the loan program's purposes while satisfying the primary purposesof the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966.  B. Subpart B  The changes made in the sections placed in Subpart B are principally todelete references to use of operating assistance to provide supplementalfunding for Rent Supplement contracts, as discussed above. The new andSection;andSection;219.205,219.215, 219.220, and 219.230 correspond to current andSection;andSection;219.120,Use and amount of assistance; 219.130, Payment schedule; 219.125, Estimatingproject revenue and operating expenses; and 219.110(c), Conditions of approval(funding priorities).  Although the current regulation section dealing with eligibility (whichhas now been moved to Subpart A) refers to an amount of assistance furnishedby the owner as determined by the Secretary, the current section on useand amount of assistance does not mention an owner contribution. The newsection on this topic does mention the owner contribution (in andSection;219.205(b))and provides that non-profit owners may be allowed to contribute in theform of services if neither the mortgagor nor the sponsor has the financialcapacity to make a cash contribution. This minimal fleshing out of thestatutory requirement that the owner provide assistance follows the procedurenow specified in HUD administrative instructions, although it is far lessspecific than those instructions. Since this is an interim rule being publishedfor immediate effect, the Department is reluctant to include any significantchanges to the content of the regulations governing the existing FlexibleSubsidy program of operating assistance.  In the final rule that follows this interim rule, however, the Departmentis considering making the requirement more specific, requiring a 30 percentcontribution by owners (but preserving the more lenient treatment for non-profitowners). Such a change in the rule would require HUD to use this percentage,an amount that is similar to the percentage now found in the existing HUDadministrative instructions. Of course, the 30 percent contribution regulationrequirement could still be waived by the Assistant Secretary for Housing-FederalHousing Commissioner in appropriate circumstances, in accordance with andSection;219.125.The Department invites the public to comment on this possible change. The current section on payment schedule focuses solely on HUD paymentsto the project owner. Its counterpart in this rule adds a paragraph todiscuss repayment of the loan at the earlier of the expiration of the termof the mortgage, the termination of mortgage insurance, or prepayment ofthe mortgage. In the final rule, the Department is considering requiringrepayment to begin earlier if a project becomes solvent and would be ableto sustain a rent increase to cover repayments of the operating assistance.Comments are invited on this proposal.  The section on estimating project revenue currently tracks the statutorylanguage (section 201(f)(2)) permitting the Secretary to estimate ``atleast 25 percent * * * of the income of each * * * tenant.'' The Secretaryhas determined to use 30 percent of income as the minimum in the correspondingsection of this rule, since the programs involved generally require thatlevel of rent.  One totally new section is added to describe briefly the application process,based on HUD's general administrative authority and section 201(g). Anothernew section has been added, based on section 201(i), to refer to HUD'sauthority to consider an owner's attempts to control utility costs as partof the rent increase approval process, which is governed by Part 245.The regulatory provisions concerning funding priorities for operating assistanceare left unchanged in this rule_again, because of this rule's status asan interim rule for effect. However, the Department is contemplating makingsome changes in priorities in the final rule and invites comment on thefollowing. With respect to the funds for projects that are not State Agencyfinanced, non-insured projects, first priority would be given to preventdefaults on insured mortgages; second priority would be given to projectswith Secretary-held mortgages; and third priority would be given to otherprojects. Within each of these three categories, projects experiencingmost immediate needs while being able to be stabilized would be fundedbefore those whose needs are less immediate. (This immediacy of need factoris basically equivalent to the language found in the funding prioritiessection of this interim rule (and in the current rule).) The principalreason for this change would be to preserve HUD's resources for preservinghousing serving low- and moderate-income families by preventing defaultsand payments of insurance claims, followed by disposition efforts involvingcommitment of HUD subsidy funds. The Department invites public commentson the possibility of making this change. C. Subpart C Most of the sections contained in Subpart C are based directly on section201 of the Housing and Community Development Amendments of 1978, as amended:Eligibility (andSection; 219.305), based on section 201(k)(1) through (k)(3);Amount of assistance (andSection; 219.315), based on section 201(l)(1); Loanterms and conditions (andSection; 219.320), based on section 201(l)(2); Effecton rental payments (andSection; 219.325), based on section 201(m); and Fundingpriorities (andSection; 219.330), based on section 201(k)(4). In addition,there are sections describing the application process (andSection; 219.310),which is similar to the provision in Subpart B, and the treatment of overruns(andSection; 219.335). A project is eligible for a capital improvement loan if, in addition tomeeting the criteria stated in Subpart A, the reserve for replacements_althoughfunded in accordance with HUD requirements_is insufficient to cover theneeded repair or replacement of a particular capital item as well as tocover other capital improvements that are reasonably expected to be requiredin the near future. (In this rule, ``near future'' is interpreted to meanthe next 24 months.) If the reserve for replacements exceeds $1,000 perunit, the owner may be required to use funds from that source to covercapital improvements_to the extent that use of the reserve would not depleteit by more than 50 percent of its value above $1,000 per unit. The eligibility section of this subpart also prescribes the amount of theowner contribution. It provides that the contribution must be made in cashand that it may not be taken from project income but may be taken fromsurplus cash from the project. Section 201(k)(2) requires that the contribution be at least 20 percentof the total estimated cost of the improvements. Section 201(m)(2) authorizesthe Secretary to require the contribution to be increased to an amountnot to exceed 30 percent. Given the history of requiring up to one-thirdcontributions in the operating assistance component, the Secretary hasdetermined that the usual amount of owner contribution in the capital improvementloan component of the program should be higher than 20 percent. Since theceiling is 30 percent, the intermediate rate of 25 percent has been selectedand is stated as the general requirement in andSection; 219.305(c). In accordancewith section 201(k)(2) of the Act, an owner's contribution required underandSection; 219.305(c) may be waived or reduced under the waiver authorityof andSection; 219.125 if sufficient justification is provided to the Secretaryfor a finding of good cause to do so. In accordance with section 201(l)(1), the rule provides that the amountof the loan can cover the cost of repairing or replacing capital itemsthat have failed or are likely to fail in the ``near future'', upgradingthese items and related items to satisfy energy efficiency strandards,and complying with Federal requirements for accessibility to persons withhandicaps. However, an administrative cap has been placed on loans thatwould otherwise be greater than the remaining balance of the mortgage:80 percent of the value of the property as repaired, less the remainingmortgage. The loan term and interest rate are to be determined on an individual basis,in accordance with section 201(l)(2). HUD will attempt to tailor each loanto the condition of the property and the ability of the rent structureto support the debt service necessary to amortize the loan. In the caseof a project with an FHA-insured mortgage, the term generally will be theremaining term of the original mortgage, and it may never exceed that length.In the case of other projects, the loan term generally will be the remainingperiod for which the owner is committed to provide lower income housing.The Secretary is authorized to charge an interest rate as low as 3 percentbelow the ``applicable Federal rate'' (as determined by the Secretary ofthe Treasury) at the end of the preceding Federal fiscal year, plus anallowance to cover HUD administrative costs and probable losses. The interestrate, including allowance, is to be no less than 3 percent nor more than6 percent. The Secretary of the Treasury will certify to HUD on an annual basis the``applicable Federal rate'' determined in accordance with this statutoryprescription. HUD has determined that the allowance for administrativecosts plus probable losses will be one-half of 1 percent. This 0.5 percentwill be taken into consideration in the following way: 3 percentage pointswill be subtracted from the applicable Federal rate, and then 0.5 percentwill be added, to determine the minimum rate. Effecetively, the minimumwill be 2\1/2\ percent below the rate determined by the Treasury as longas the HUD-determined allowance remains at one-half of 1 percent. As longas the ``applicable Federal rate'' is 8.5 percent or above, the minimumrate would be 6 percent or more. Since the statute provides that the rateused may not exceed 6 percent, any mimimum exceeding 6 percent may be ignored.Therefore, to the extent that the applicable Federal rate remains at 8.5percent or above, the standard rate used by HUD will be 6 percent (representingboth the minimum and maximum rate). If the applicable Federal rate determinedby the Treasury in a particular year falls below 8.5 percent, HUD willpublish the rate so that the public will have notice of a minimum ratelower than 6 percent. Of course, in a case of extreme rent burden (as discussedbelow), a rate lower than this standard minimum rate may be authorized.A project may receive more than one type of assistance under the FlexibleSubsidy program. However, the rule provides that different forms of assistancemay not be provided within a five-year period to remedy the same deficiency.In addition, the rule provides that a capital improvement will not be financedpartly by operating assistance under Subpart A and partly by a capitalimprovement loan under Subpart B. The rule follows the statute in providing that if the rents to be chargedlower income residents of the project would be in excess of those generallycharged tenants of section 8 projects, HUD may consider decreasing theimpact on tenants by making housing assistance payments under the section8 Loan Mangement Set-aside program or the section 8 Certificate program,increasing the length of the term or reducing the interest rate (to notless than 1 percent), or by increasing the owner contribution (therebyreducing the amount of the capital improvement loan to be amortized anddecreasing the rents needed to support the loan). Since the 1987 amendments make it clear that the top priority for fundingcapital improvement loans is to provide incentives to owners who mightotherwise prepay their mortgages and terminate their project's availabilityto low- and moderate-income tenants, the rule provides a set-aside forthis category of projects. At the beginning of each fiscal year, HUD willestimate the amount of the capital improvement part of the Flexible SubsidyFund that is necessary for handling the prepayment priority, and the remainderwill be made available for other eligible projects. With respect to theseother eligible projects, the rule follows the statute's requirement thatpriority be given based on four other factors: immediacy of need, lackof availability of other suitable housing for low- and moderate-incometenants, degree to which the deficiencies involve life, safety or healthof the residents or major capital improvements, and the degree of financialdistress. No one of these priorities is necessarily to be given highervalue than the others. <ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Justification for Interim Rule </ITAG>Section 1011(b) of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988(Pub. L. 100-628, approved November 7, 1988) requires that, ``the Secretaryof Housing and Urban Development shall issue regulations that become effectivenot later than February 5, 1989.'' Although the Department has been unableto meet this precise deadline for publication, every effort is being madeto comply with the deadline by making the rule effective upon publication.We note that there are two procedural requirements that would have beenobstacles to publication of a rule for effect by the statutory deadline.First, the general requirement for advance publication and solicitationof public participation in rulemaking would have required delays of severalmonths after a rule was developed before it could have taken effect. Second,the provision requiring that effectiveness of HUD rules be delayed afterpublication until the expiration of 30 continuous days of the session ofCongress would have delayed this rule's effectiveness until mid-April,based on its publication in mid-February. (See sec. 7(o)(3), Departmentof Housing and Urban Development Act, 42 U.S.C. 3535(o)(3).)Although the Administrative Procedure Act (``the APA'') (5 U.S.C. 553)requirements for advance publication and solicitation of public participationbefore issuing a rule for effect do not apply to this rulemaking becausethe program affected is covered by an exemption for public grants and contracts,HUD's own rule on rulemaking, 24 CFR Part 10, adopting these principles,does apply. Generally, HUD publishes a proposed rule and invites publiccomment before developing a rule to be published for effect, and when arule is published for effect it is to be published at least 30 days beforeits effective date.Part 10 does provide for exceptions from the general rule for advance noticeand public participation and for publication in advance of effectiveness(as does the APA) where the agency finds good cause to omit them and statesthe basis in the rule. The good cause requirement is satisfied when priorpublic procedure is ``impracticable, unnecessary, or contrary to the publicinterest.'' 24 CFR 10.1.In this case, the Department has not had sufficient time between November7, 1988 and the date of publication to develop and publish both a proposedrule for comment and a final rule for effect. Therefore, the Departmentfinds that with the statutory deadline of publishing a rule for effectby February 5, 1989, and a statutory requirement to spend a stated minimumamount of money on the new program that is the subject of this rule, priorpublic procedure is impracticable, and there is good cause for publicationof this rule for effect. In an attempt to provide maximum public participation,however, the Department is inviting public comment on this rule and willconsider comments received in the development of a final rule.With respect to the statutory requirement for a delayed effective datedependent on the Congressional schedule, satisfaction of both the delayedeffectiveness requirement of the Department of HUD Act <T3>and</T3> the statutory deadline for effectiveness imposed by section1011 of the McKinney Homeless Assistance Amendments Act of 1988, wouldhave required publishing this rule by September 22, 1988, more than a monthbefore the McKinney Act was signed into law. Since the Congress knew, atthe time the Amendments Act was adopted, that legislative review requirementsunder section 7(o)(3) of the Department of HUD Act could not be met byFebruary 5, 1989, the Department finds that section 7(o)(3) (42 U.S.C.3535(o)(3)) is in conflict with section 1011 of the McKinney Act, and thatthe McKinney Act provision renders section 7(o)(3) inapplicable in thiscase, permitting the rule to become effective upon publication.<ITAG tagnum="84">V.

(c) Any amounts in the Fund determined by the Secretary to be in excessof the amounts currently required to carry out the provisions of this partshall be invested by the Secretary in obligations of, or obligations guaranteedas to both principal and interest by, the United States or any agency ofthe United States. (d) At the beginning of each fiscal year, funds are allocated for two categoriesof projects: State agency financed non-insured projects; and all others,including projects with FHA-insured and HUD-held mortgages. Each categoryis allocated an amount based on the number of units in potentially eligibleprojects of that category as a percentage of the total number of unitsin all potentially eligible projects. Once these two funding categoriesare established, each category will be administered to comply with thestatutory requirement concerning spending for the capital improvement loanprogram enumerated in paragraph (e) of this section, by spending 40 percentof its allocation, or its share of the stated dollar amount (whicheveris less), to the extent of approvable applications. (e) The Secretary will use not less than $30 million, or 40 percent ofthe amounts available in the Fund (subject to paragraph (a) of this section)in any fiscal year (whichever is less), for purposes of providing capitalimprovement loans under Subpart C of this part, to the extent of approvableapplications. If any of the amounts reserved for capital improvement loansremains unused 60 days before the end of a fiscal year, it will becomeavailable for operating assistance under Subpart B. (f) Funding decisions are made on a quarterly basis using the applicablepriorities enumerated in Subparts B and C. As the end of each fiscal yearapproaches, HUD will determine to what extent there are funds requiredto be used for capital improvement loans (under paragraph (e) of this section)that are allocated for one of the two major categories (described in paragraph(d) of this section) but are unlikely to be used by projects of that category.In the last quarter, to the extent there is to be an excess in either ofthe categories for capital improvement loans that could be used for suchloans to eligible applicants of the other category, the funds will be reallocated.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;219.120 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Local government consultation. </ITAG>The Secretary, before making assistance available to a project, will consultwith the appropriate officials of the unit of local government in whichthe project is located and seek the following assurances: (a) The community in which the project is located is providing, or willprovide, essential services to the project in keeping with the community'sgeneral level of these services; (b) The real estate taxes on the project are or will be no greater thanwould be the case if the property were assessed in a manner consistentwith normal property assessment procedures for the community; and (c) Assistance to the project under this part would not be inconsistentwith local plans and priorities. andSection;219.125 Environmental requirements.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;219.125 </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Environmental requirements. </ITAG>In order to be approved for funding under this part, an application forassistance to cover a capital improvement, as defined in andSection;219.305,will be reviewed for compliance with applicable environmental requirements,as follows. (a) If the proposed capital improvements involve major mechanical systems,HUD will determine whether the project is located in a 100-year floodplainand if so, will take all feasible actions to minimize the impact of floodingon the mechanical systems. (b) If a project is listed on the National Register of Historic Places,the proposed use of funds will be reviewed for compliance with the NationalHistoric Preservation Act of 1966. As a general rule, in-kind replacementswill not trigger review under the Act. If the project is not listed onthe National Register but is located in a historic district, review underthe Act will only be required where there are proposed alterations to theexterior that are not in-kind. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 219.130</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Waivers. </ITAG>Upon a determination of good cause, the Secretary of Housing and UrbanDevelopment may, subject to statutory limitations, waive any provisionof this part.

A repair or replacement item is onlyeligible under this program if no previous payment of HUD-related assistance(such as assistance under this part, Housing Development Grant, or CommunityDevelopment Block Grant) has been made. A capital improvement (as describedin andSection; 219.305(a)) is eligible for funding as part of operating assistanceonly if it is necessary to meet local building codes or to maintain theproject in a decent, safe and sanitary condition and the Secretary determinesthat this method of funding the improvement is the most efficient; (2) An amount determined by the Secretary to be necessary to maintain thelow- and moderate-income character of the project by reducing deficiencies(which exist at the beginning of the first year of assistance and for whichpayment has not previously been made) in the reserve fund established bythe project owner for the purpose of replacing capital items; (3) An amount not greater than the amount by which the estimated operatingexpenses for the year for which assistance is made available exceeds theestimated revenues to be received by the project during that year, as determinedin accordance with andSection; 219.210; and(4) An amount determined by the Secretary to be necessary to carry outa plan to upgrade the project to meet cost-effective energy efficiencystandards approved by the Secretary.(b) The owner must provide assistance to the project.

Percentages of adjusted income, as definedin 24 CFR Part 813, can be based on the most recent tenant income certification.In no case will the amount used for this estimate exceed the HUD-approvedrent for the project.(ii) A vacancy allowance may be used in developing the estimated revenuefor non-insured projects and HUD-held projects. This allowance may notexceed 6 percent of the rental payments otherwise to be anticipated, unlessthe Secretary permits a higher allowance for the first three years in whichassistance is to be provided to a project under this subpart because thehigher allowance is necessary to carry out the purposes of this subpart.(2) The estimated amount of assistance payments to be made on behalf ofthe tenants during the year other than assistance made under this subpart;and(3) Other income attributable to the project as determined by the Secretary,such as, commercial rental income, tax rebates or refunds, condemnationor insurance award proceeds.(b) <T3>Computing estimated project operating expenses.</T3> The estimatedoperating expenses of any project with respect to any year shall includeall estimated operating costs that the Secretary determines to be necessaryand consistent with the MIO plan for the project for the year.

Capital improvementsalso may include limited supplements or enhancements to mechanical equipmentneeded for health and safety of the residents, such as air conditioning,heating equipment, or water softeners, where they do not exist. Capitalimprovements do not include maintenance of any such item.(b) Assistance under this subpart will be in the form of a loan. The Secretarywill provide this assistance only if the Secretary determines that theowner's reserve for replacements (including any surplus cash, residualreceipts or other funds from the project account or escrow outside theproject account that could be used to fund the reserve) is insufficientto finance both the capital improvements for which assistance is beingrequested and other capital improvements that are reasonably expected tobe required within the next 24 months, as described in the owner's workwrite-up (submitted as part of the application), and that the owner hasfunded the reserve fund in accordance with HUD requirements. An owner'sreserve for replacements may only be tapped to cover needed capital improvementsif the reserve exceeds $1,000 per unit, and then only to the extent ofdepleting it by up to 50 percent of the amount over $1,000 per unit onthe date the capital improvement loan is made.(c) An owner must contribute 25 percent of the total estimated cost ofthe capital improvements involved, unless the owner is a nonprofit corporation(other than a cooperative association), in which case it is exempt fromthis contribution requirement. The total estimated cost of the capitalimprovements includes the cost of the estimate of work, the cost of materials,and the cost of labor. This estimate must be approved by HUD as cost effective.(1) The contribution must be made in cash. It must not be taken from projectincome, but may be taken from surplus cash (as defined in the RegulatoryAgreement) from the project.(2) Cash that has already been agreed to be contributed to the projectas a condition for receiving operating assistance or approval of purchaseof the project (TPA) will not be considered for purposes of meeting thiscontribution requirement.(3) When an owner has spent its own money (as from surplus cash) to attemptto repair capital items within the 24 months before the application, andthe repair was unsuccessful and has resulted in a need for a replacement(to be funded by a capital improvement loan), that expenditure will beconsidered for credit for purposes of meeting this contribution requirement.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;219.310</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Application.</ITAG>(a) A project owner must submit an application on a form approved by theSecretary, which will include a work write-up to describe the capital improvementsto be covered by the requested loan (see andSection;219.315), and other documentationof eligibility, as described in andSection;andSection;219.110 and 219.305.(b) The application must be accompanied by a MIO plan only in the followingcases:(1) A default under the mortgage;(2) A violation of the fiscal requirements or property maintenance requirementsof the regulatory agreement (for other than willful or fraudulent reasons);(3) An unsatisfactory or marginally satisfactory management review in thepast 24 months (unless the owner has corrected the problems through a substitutionof management agent, management personnel, or otherwise, in a manner satisfactoryto HUD); and(4) A situation that HUD Headquarters has determined requires submissionof a MIO plan.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;219.315</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Amount of assistance.</ITAG>(a) The amount of assistance will not exceed the sum of the following,minus the owner contribution made in accordance with andSection;219.305:(1) The amount the Secretary determines is necessary to cover capital improvementsat the project with respect to capital items that have failed, or are likelyto fail or deteriorate seriously within 24 months;(2) The amount the Secretary determines is necessary to upgrade the capitalitems and related capital items to meet cost-effective energy efficiencystandards approved by HUD; and(3) The amount the Secretary determines is necessary to comply with theDepartment's standards in 24 CFR Part 8 for accessibility to individualswith handicaps.(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if the requested loanis greater than the remaining balance of the mortgage, the loan will notexceed 80 percent of the appraised value of the property as repaired, lessthe balance of the first mortgage.<ITAG tagnum="80">andSection;219.320</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Loan terms and conditions.</ITAG>(a) The length of the loan term will be determined based on various factors,including the useful life of the improvement, the amount financed, andthe impact on tenant rents. The term generally will be for the remainingperiod of the original mortgage, and the term may not exceed that period.With respect to a non-insured project, the loan term will generally befor the remaining period during which the owner is under an obligationto provide housing for lower income families, and the term may not exceedthat period.(b) In determining the interest rate on the loan, the Secretary will considerfactors such as the length of the loan term and the effect of the requireddebt service on tenant rents.(1) The minimum rate is the applicable Federal rate determined by the Secretaryof the Treasury at the end of the Federal fiscal year before the loan isto be made, minus 3 percentage points, plus an allowance established bythe Secretary of HUD to cover administrative costs and probable lossesunder the program.(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b)(1) of this section,the rate to be charged may not be less than 3 percent nor more than 6 percent.(3) The rate that represents both the minimum and the maximum rate is 6percent, unless the applicable Federal rate determined by the Secretaryof the Treasury for a fiscal year is less than 8.5 percent or HUD changesthe allowance from its initial amount of .5 percent, thereby producinga minimum rate other than 6 percent. In that event, HUD will publish inthe <T4>Federal Register</T4> the following: the rate determined by the Secretaryof the Treasury, the allowance established by HUD, and the minimum rate.(4) Notwithstanding the minimum rate limitations specified in paragraphs(b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section, the Secretary may charge a lesser rateif the Secretary determines that the lower rate is necesary to maintainreasonable rental rates.
