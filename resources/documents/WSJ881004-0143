Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> NCB GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK TNM BCY </IN><DATELINE> DALLAS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   First RepublicBank Corp. said it has more than $3.51 billion in debt, more than 12 times the current value of its property and assets, according to its latest bankruptcy court filing.    The detailed financial accounting disclosed that the company, whose 41 bank units failed about two months ago and were seized by bank regulators, is more deeply insolvent than originally believed. When it filed its initial bankruptcy-law papers in July, the company estimated total liabilities of $1.43 billion.    First RepublicBank, which isn't related to San Francisco-based First Republic Bancorp, sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal Bankruptcy Code after the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. orchestrated a $4 billion rescue of its banking units by transferring them to NCNB Corp. of Charlotte, N.C. The bailout has drawn protests from bank holding company creditors who believe that regulators may have illegally closed some banks that were solvent. Without its banks, the corporation, once Texas's leading bank holding company, was left with little to pay its debt.    The FDIC has repeatedly defended its action and denied any wrongdoing, but attorneys for First RepublicBank and its creditors say they are preparing to sue the government for the illegal transfer of the banks.    The document, which was filed late Friday here, listed total debt of about $3.51 billion, consisting mostly of long-term debt held by creditors that include some of the nation's largest pension funds and insurance companies.    First RepublicBank listed property with book value totaling $284 million. The property consists mostly of office fixtures, but it includes a fancy suite for viewing home games of the Dallas Cowboys professional football team, a small fleet of cars and a portrait of a past chairman and chief executive. The filing warns that more than $200 million of property, consisting mostly of stock and claims, &quot;is likely to be significantly less than book value.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
