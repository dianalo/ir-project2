Brent D. Brandon, 30, of Houston, the Raven's electronic-weaponsofficer, said the Iraqi fighter rolled in a mile or so behind the EF-111Aduring a night mission on Jan. 17 near an airfield in western Iraq and fired amissile.;    &quot;I actually saw the missile snaking. It's like an orange flaresnaking at the canopy.&quot;;    To avoid the missile, the American jet dove towithin a couple of hundred feet of the ground and released chaff and decoyflares to try to divert the heat-seeking missile from its engines.;    At thesame time, the pilot, Capt. Jim Denton, accelerated and made a hard rightbanking turn, Brandon said.;    The pursuing Iraqi fighter, apparently tryingto unleash another missile, couldn't match the maneuver.;    &quot;We got so low hecouldn't hack it and smeared into the ground behind us,&quot; Brandon said.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Scripps Howard News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  An Airbase In Saudi Arabia  </CITY><EDITION>  Stock Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910222  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Friday  </DAY><MONTH>  February  </MONTH><PG.COL>  13A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  223  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Friday February 22, 199100053222,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
