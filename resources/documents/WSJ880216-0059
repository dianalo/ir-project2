According to Commerce Department data, the nation imported 20,414,000 tons last year, compared with 20,692,000 tons in 1986.    The figures, compiled by the American Iron and Steel Institute, an industry trade group, also showed that imports took only a 21.3% share of the U.S. market -- down from 23% in 1986 and 26.4% in 1984, when the Reagan administration imposed quotas on foreign steel.    The latest data sparked more disagreement over quotas. Steel buyers, distributors and importers have increasingly blamed the artificial restraints for higher domestic prices and shortages in many steel products. Quotas are scheduled to expire in 1989.    In particular, the program, aimed at immunizing the domestic industry from foreign competition while it modernized, has hurt those domestic steelmakers that lack sufficient supplies of semifinished steel, which U.S. producers themselves use to finish into sheet and plate products.    Erwin L. Klein, vice chairman of Steelinter USA Inc., a New York-based importer of Belgian steel, said any smaller level of steel imports would have created even &quot;greater shortages than steel-using sectors are now experiencing.&quot;    While quotas don't expire until next year, the U.S. trade group nonetheless called for the Reagan administration to commit itself now to an extension of the program. Despite the industry's profitability, the nation's biggest steelmakers, led by USX Corp., say they need more time to recover from years of losses.    In addition, &quot;Producers need long lead times to plan capital investments, and can logically do so only when they have reasonable assurances of a market for their products,&quot; said Thomas C. Graham, a USX vice chairman and the U.S. trade group's president.    In December, the most recent month for which data are available, imports totaled 1,729,000 tons -- up 14% from a year earlier but down 4.5% from November 1987. Nonetheless, economists say such month-to-month comparisons aren't meaningful. </TEXT></DOC>
