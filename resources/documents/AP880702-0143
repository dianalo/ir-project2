Clinton is the second southerner named to a prominent conventionspeaking role. Texas State Treasurer Ann Richards was named lastweek to deliver the keynote speech opening the convention inAtlanta July 18.   Clinton will address the delegates the next night, formallynominating Dukakis for the party's presidential nomination. He willdeliver a 15-minute speech focusing on Dukakis' record asMassachusetts governor and his leadership abilities, the Dukakiscampaign said.   ``Bill Clinton is a leader among the nation's governors whoshares my commitment to building a strong economic future,''Dukakis said in a campaign statement. ``He is an eloquent spokesmanfor our party.''   Clinton, who has worked at lengths with Dukakis as part of theNational Governors Association, told a news conference in LittleRock that Dukakis is sincere about wanting to spur economicdevelopment in the South.   Dukakis ``was very forthright in discussing with me howprofoundly concerned he was that our part of the country was soeconomically depressed and had been so neglected by the nationaladministration, and he said he just didn't understand how you couldhave a national government that didn't try to help distressed areasof the country,'' Clinton said.   ``I think the American people ought to know that,'' Clintonsaid. ``He cares about people who aren't as well off as he thinksthey ought to be, who don't have the opportunities that they oughtto have. That counts for a lot with me.''   Tradition at recent conventions is for a brief nominating speechfollowed by one or two seconding speeches. But Dukakis spokesmanMark Gearan said Clinton would deliver the sole nominating address.   Jackson, who is expected to have his name placed into nominationas well, was scheduled to visit Dukakis on Monday. Jackson and hiswife, Jackie, were to dine with Dukakis and his wife, Kitty. Theythen were to attend the traditional Boston Pops Independence Dayconcert on the banks of the Charles River.   Dukakis aides say the meeting is largely social but that theyexpect the subject of the No. 2 spot on the ticket to come up.   Jackson is being considered but Dukakis advisers say it ishighly unlikely that he would be offered the vice presidentialnomination. For his part, Jackson has said he has decided whetherhe would accept if it was offered to him but has not said what hehas decided.   Dukakis staffers assigned to the running mate search wereworking through the holiday weekend, meeting in their secretivefifth floor office of the campaign's headquarters. The handful ofcampaign aides working on the search have elevator keys to gainaccess to the floor.   Sens. John Glenn of Ohio and Lloyd Bentsen of Texas areconsidered the leading candidates, followed by Rep. Lee Hamilton ofIndiana and Sen. Bob Graham of Florida. Dukakis met with more than30 senators and congressmen last week to discuss the search and hasadditional Capitol Hill meetings set for July 13.   In addition to the Jackson meeting, Dukakis on Monday wasscheduled to deliver a speech on national security.   He returned from a Midwest campaign swing Friday afternoon andwas back at the Statehouse on Saturday morning.   Dukakis, aides said, spent the majority of his time tending tostate business but also held an hour-long meeting with Reps.William Gray III of Pennsylvania and David R. Obey of Wisconsin.Gray is chairman of the House Budget Committee; Obey sits on theHouse Appropriations Committee and the Joint Committee on Economics.</TEXT></DOC>
