(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   About 3,000 people, including weepingpolice officers and firefighters, jammed a memorial service Sundayfor seven children whose lives ended suddenly when a tornado toreinto their elementary school.   ``We gather here because, despite the inadequacy of our words,so great a grief cannot be borne without being shared,'' Gov. MarioCuomo told mourners at Valley Central High School.   ``Death, like life, is a mystery ... a mystery that deepens whenthe people taken from us are like Amy, Joanna, Larae, Peter,Charles, Adam and Maria,'' said Cuomo, naming the youngsterscrushed under a wall Thursday. ``So young, so bright, so innocent,so loved and so lovely.''   Many residents greeted each other with silent hugs as theyarrived for the service.   ``We have come together in response to an experience that hasshattered us and unified us,'' the Rev. John Rottenberg of theFirst Reformed Church in Walden said.   The school's auditorium, which seats 1,200, was packed with1,500 people. About 1,500 more mourners crowded around loudspeakersin cafeterias, classrooms and hallways of the school, straining tohear the service.   Some inside the auditorium wept, including police officers andfirefighters who were among the first to reach the disaster.   ``Everybody hurts deeply and we need each other now,'' saidElena Stahl, a sixth-grade teacher at Valley Central ElementarySchool, before the service. ``By being together we will find somesolace.''   Vera DiBitetto stroked the blond hair of her 5-year-old sonMichael. She said it will be a sad Thanksgiving Day for thecommunity.   ``It will be a terrible memory for the families every year aboutthis time,'' she said. ``Maybe it will make us all a little morethankful for what we have right now.''   Several speakers urged mourners to be hopeful in the face oftragedy.   The Rev. Raymond McCracken of the Coldenham ReformedPresbyterian Church said he'd been able to rejoice for the familieswhose children had been saved as well as weep for the children whodied and their families.   ``By God's grace, may be all be able to do that: Rejoice forthose who rejoice and weep for those who weep,'' McCracken said.   The seven students, aged 7 or 8, were killed at the EastColdenham Elementary School when the wall of the cafeteria roomwhere they were lunching gave way during a tornado. Eighteen otherswere injured, two critically.   On Saturday, hundreds of mourners, many of them young childrenwho wept uncontrollably, filled funeral chapels to hear servicesfor two young victims of the tornado, Peter Orsino Jr. and LaraeMarie Litchhult, both 8. Five of their classmates will be buriedMonday.   More bad luck struck Newburgh on Sunday when a 5-year-oldstudent at the East Coldenham school was critically injured in anautomobile accident. A vehicle struck the car she was riding in afew hundred yards from the school.   A car driven by Rosalie Sbordone's mother was hit by a vehicledriven by Roland Hoehn, 44, of Savannah, Ga. Hoehn was charged withreckless driving and failure to keep right. Rosalie was in criticalcondition at St. Luke's Hospital in Newburgh.   A steady stream of parents and children also flocked to the EastColdenham Elementary School Sunday, many carrying flowers, candlesand letters to the victims.   ``Our Hearts Go Out To Those Who Have Lost,'' read aheart-shaped plaque that leaned against a wooden wall that nowserves as the cafeteria wall.   ``Please Pray For The Children'' was painted in blue on threepanels of that wall.   Flowers adorned the trodden ground outside the cafeteria.Letters were also placed near the now-demolished cafeteria wallencouraging families to be strong.   ``Children _ The Greatest Gift God Can Give Us,'' read one note.   ``God never promised us that we would not have these terribletimes in our lives ... that there would not be hurricanes andtornados, earthquakes and floods,'' Bechtel said during theservices for Peter Orsino. ``But it is in our sorrow and grief, ouranger and our frustration that we need to find a way to help uslive our todays and our tomorrows.''</TEXT></DOC>
