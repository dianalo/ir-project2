Grantham, 21, of Rogers was hunting Sept. 16 when hefound the remains of Dana Stidham of Centerton, who disappeared onJuly 26. Her death is being investigated as a homicide.   Grantham said Thursday that he waited not just because he waslate for an afternoon of dove hunting with a friend, but alsobecause he did not realize the remains were recent.   ``I knew there were a lot of Civil War relics and Indian relicsin the area, and I thought it might be something like that,'' hesaid.   The bones ``weren't going anywhere,'' he said. ``I'll admit it.I was wrong.''
