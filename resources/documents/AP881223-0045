Gandhi, accompanied by his wife, Sonia, departed for home fromShanghai after his five-day visit, the first by an Indian head ofgovernment since his grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, visited in 1954.   Both sides said the visit ushered in a new era of good willbetween the world's most populous nations. Gandhi said his tripmarked a ``new beginning'' for the two countries.   During the visit, the countries agreed to set up a joint workinggroup to take up their most divisive issue, a territorial disputethat broke out into a short border war in 1962.   ``The leaders of the two countries held earnest, in-depthdiscussions on the India-China boundary question and agreed tosettle this question through peaceful and friendly consultations,''a joint communique said.   It added, ``They also agreed to develop their relations activelyin other fields and work hard to create a favorable climate andconditions for a fair and reasonable settlement of the boundaryquestion.''   It said Gandhi's talks with Chinese Premier Li Peng were held``in an atmosphere of friendship, candidness and mutualunderstanding.'' Gandhi also met with senior leader Deng Xiaoping,Communist Party head Zhao Ziyang and President Yang Shangkun.   The border issue, Gandhi said, is ``very complicated'' and aquick solution is unlikely.   China claims 36,000 square miles of mountainous frontier in whatNew Delhi says is northeast India's Arunachal Pradesh province.India says China illegally occupies 14,500 square miles on itswestern border.   The communique said China ``expressed concern over anti-Chinaactivities by some Tibetan elements in India,'' and that the Indianside repeated its policy of recognizing Tibet as a part of China andbanning Tibetans from carrying out anti-Chinese political activitieson Indian soil.   India has been the home of Tibet's religious leader, the DalaiLama, and thousands of his followers who fled Tibet after anabortive anti-Chinese uprising in 1959. China blames supporters ofthe Dalai Lama for pro-independence activities that have led toviolent clashes with police the past 14 months.   Gandhi on Thursday presided over the signing of three bilateralagreements _a civil aviation accord calling for direct flightsbetween New Delhi and Beijing, a three-year cultural agreement and ascience and technology agreement.   The communique said Premier Li accepted an invitation to visitIndia, but no date was set.   China, grappling with economic problems at home, has made acommitment to improving relations with its neighbors.   Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev is expected to visit Chinanext year, becoming the first Soviet leader to do so in 30 years.   China will likely normalize relations with the Soviet Unionduring the visit. The two countries fought a border war in 1969.</TEXT></DOC>
