Is for Sarah, Updike's Saucy ScarletWoman</HEAD><BYLINE>By GENEVA COLLINS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   It is no accident that the cover of JohnUpdike's new novel consists entirely of an oversize scarlet letter.   ``S.'' (Knopf, $17.95) is a contemporary spin on NathanielHawthorne's classic tale of adultery. It is also a lightheartedsend-up of the New Age fascination with Eastern religions and apoignant study of the dynamics of marriage through Updike'sever-wise eyes.   ``S.'' is actually Updike's third telling of ``The ScarletLetter.'' His 1975 novel, ``A Month of Sundays,'' was the Rev.Dimmesdale's version in modern dress; his last novel, ``Roger'sVersion,'' portrayed the cuckolded husband, Roger Chillingsworth.Sarah Worth, the protagonist of ``S.,'' finally tells us HesterPrynne's side of the story.   Updike talked about his 13th novel during a recent visit to NewYork from his Beverly, Mass., home. Wearing a writer's gray tweedjacket and exuding boyish energy, the 56-year-old Pulitzer Prizewinner sat behind a desk in a vacant office at his publisher's,fidgeting with a paper clip and pondering why he is so captivatedwith the subject of adultery.   ``It fascinates a lot of novelists. Somebody once said thatwithout adultery you don't have the novel. It used to be ... theonly way in which a woman became a revolutionary. It was ahigh-energy transaction. It was the way in which marriage, whichwas the basis of the bourgeois social order, was betrayed,'' saidUpdike.   For men, the author noted, adultery was part of the socialorder: ``There were mistresses built into the system. There werebrothels built into the system, so that in a way the male adultererdoes not seem to be as conflicted or as passionate or as troubledor as vulnerable a creature as the adulteress.''   In ``S.,'' Sarah, a middle-aged New England housewife, flees herinattentive doctor husband (after taking amply from their jointbank accounts) to join a religious commune in Arizona that bearsmore than a passing resemblance to the now-dismantled Rajneeshpuramin Oregon. Her imperial air and Seven Sisters pedigree quickly gainher entrance into the guru's inner circle, where she becomes a kindof personal secretary and bookkeeper.   ``There is a way in which Sarah is a `wicked woman,' kind ofselfish and heedless and cavalier; she's no saint,'' Updike said ofhis protagonist. ``But there is a way in which Hester Prynne is nota saint initially either. When we see her as a young woman, she'skind of sassy, really.''   Asked if the reader is supposed to like Sarah, this ``wickedwoman,'' Updike laughed and replied shyly, ``It'd be nice if youwould. I'd be grateful. I like her ... because she's energetic andalso purposeful. She's no slouch. Tossed out into the world shedoes pretty well in it.   ``I think what we like in fiction is life. And the novelist'shope is to imbue the characters with life rather than virtue.Dickens had a nice way of getting us really enthusiastic aboutvirtuous characters. I'm not sure that in the late 20th century wecan make people that pure.''   Updike, born in Shillington, Pa., educated at HarvardUniversity, and a Massachusetts resident for the past threedecades, has published 19 other books _ collections of poems,essays and short stories _ in addition to the novels. He is alsothe foreign books reviewer for the New Yorker.   The author has mined a prolific career out of his study ofmale-female relationships. He is probably best known for creatingthe ribald Harry ``Rabbit'' Angstrom in 1960's ``Rabbit, Run,''bringing him back a decade later in ``Rabbit Redux'' and again in1981's ``Rabbit Is Rich,'' which won him a Pulitzer, an AmericanBook Award and a National Book Critics Circle Award.   Updike has come under fire for his handling of female charactersin the ``Rabbit'' trilogy as well as some of his other work. In arecent New York Times interview he said he wrote ``S.'' to satisfyhis ``feminist detractors.''   ``I'm almost sorry I used that phrase,'' Updike said. ``In fact,women tend to review my books more understandingly and kindly thanmen. In `The Witches of Eastwick' (with three female protagonists)the women reviewers were much more amused with it than some of themen. ... But I suppose I was impressed by the feminist point thatmany women in my books have tended to be dependent and seen to alarge degree as sex objects. So in my clumsy way I'm trying to makefemale protagonists who are the center of the action.''   ``S.'' is an epistolary novel, in which the story is toldthrough letters Sarah writes to her husband, daughter, mother,friends, even her dentist and hairdresser. The convention usuallydoesn't allow for dialogue but Updike cleverly circumvents thisconstraint by having Sarah conceal a tape recorder in her clothes.   Although the epistolary form has built-in limitations, Updikesaid, ``It's a blessing in a way because it spares you some of thecarpentry work of the third-person novel.''   ``I've always been a realistic writer who treasures getting thefurniture and clothes right. I had to abjure a lot of that detail.Probably good for me, sort of a cleansing operation.''   Even in a breezy satire such as ``S.'' Updike's prose isluminescent. He is America's premiere stylist, writing with aprecision and lushness that borders on the rococo in hisdescriptions of the Arizona terrain or of Sarah's beloved NewEngland garden.   Updike was once called a ``creator of moral fables.'' He wasasked if that label fit.   ``I think of my books as being more moral investigations,'' hesaid. ``I try to raise the question of what is morality and what isgoodness, more than to offer a definition. I think any novel to bealive must fluctuate somewhat in its moral standpoint; maybefluctuate is the wrong word, but it should have ambiguity builtinto it. It should make the reader think a bit, surprise him a bit,make him investigate his own life, rather than present him withvillains and heros and a good way and a bad way.''</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Weekend Editions, April 8-10</NOTE></DOC>
