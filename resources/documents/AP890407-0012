The document, read to the Iran-Contra jury by North's defenseattorneys, placed Bush at a May 1985 meeting in Honduras withthen-President Roberto Suazo. It says Bush informed Suazo ofPresident Reagan's decision to speed U.S. military and economic aidto the country.   What set up the Bush meeting were behind-the-scenes discussionsamong North and other U.S. officials on a plan to seek assistancefrom other countries to tide over the Nicaraguan rebels at a timewhen direct or indirect American assistance was outlawed byCongress.   A preface to the document said ``the United States has admittedfor purposes of this trial the following facts to be true,'' and itwent to lengths to stitch together how the secret covert supportprogram worked.   In effect, the Reagan program established a ``quid pro quo''relationship basing U.S. assistance to Honduras and some othercountries at least in part on those countries' willingness to helpsustain the Contra fighting force.   There was no indication that Bush cited this linkage in hismeeting with Suazo. But in earlier testimony, former nationalsecurity adviser Robert McFarlane had said the aid was part of asecret agreement calling for Honduras, in return, to help theContras.   Portions of the document show Bush as an enthusiastic supporterof the effort to tide over the Contras until direct U.S. assistancecould be resumed.   In early March 1985, for instance, Bush asked McFarlane whetherhe (the vice president) should ``encourage a private group todonate a planeload of medical supplies that would arrive inHonduras coincident with'' Bush's meeting with Suazo.   ``Bush strongly favored such a flight,'' the document said,``noting that the (unidentified) group was supportive of theresistance.'' It said North told McFarlane that Bush's idea wassound. The document did not reveal whether the planeload ofsupplies actually arrived in conjunction with his visit.   Asked on Thursday about the revelation of Bush's go-between rolewith the Honduran leader, White House press secretary MarlinFitzwater said: ``We can't say anything. It would become a part ofthe case.''   Bush has denied ever having any knowledge of a diversion of Iranarms-sales proceeds to the Contras, although he admitted knowingabout the clandestine arms sales to Iran and said he supported theinitiative with certain reservations. Donald Gregg, his nationalsecurity adviser during the period in question, said he did nottell Bush about the Contra resupply effort that Gregg had learnedabout from Felix Rodriguez, a one-time CIA associate.   Two Maine senators who played key roles in the congressionalinvestigation of the Iran-Contra affair _ Democrat George Mitchelland Republican William Cohen _ said in a book published last yearthat Bush's role in the scandal remained unanswered.   And Rep. Lee Hamilton, D-Ind., chairman of the House Iran-Contrapanel, said in the wake of the congressional probe that the countrystill lacked ``a full and complete explanation'' of Bush's role.   A source who had been involved in the congressional committees'investigation, who discussed the situation Thursday on grounds ofanonymity, said Bush ``didn't leave very many footprints anywhere.It needs to be said that the extent of his knowledge was not ourmajor goal. We were more interested in what the president (Reagan)knew.''   But this source also said that ``it was because he left so fewfootprints, I think, that he was treated so well in the (finalinvestigative) report'' by the congressional panel.   According to the court document, Bush personally told Suazoduring their May 1985 meeting in Honduras that extra aid was beingfunneled to his country.   McFarlane testified Reagan personally approved the secret dealto slip $110 million in extra aid to Honduras as one of several``quid pro quo'' arrangements with other countries in exchange forsupport for the Contras.   McFarlane said Reagan telephoned Suazo to gain the release of anarms shipment to the Contras that had been seized by a Honduranmilitary commander.   The statement entered in court said: ``Vice President Bush alsoinformed Suazo that President Reagan had directed that currentlywithheld economic assistance for Honduras should be released, thatthe United States would provide from its own military stockscritical security assistance items that had been ordered byHonduran armed forces, and that several security programs under wayfor Honduran security forces would be enhanced.''   In a Dec. 3, 1986 speech to the American Enterprise Institutehere _ little more than a week after the Iran-Contra affair brokeinto public view _ Bush said that whie he was aware of Reagan'sIran arms sales and had supported them, ``I was not aware of _ andoppose _ any diversion of funds, any ransom payments or anycircumvention of the will of the Congress.''   A presidentially-appointed investigative commission headed byformer Sen. John Tower, R-Texas, and a joint congressional panelfound no meaningful role by Bush.   The newly released document revealed that Bush saw several Northmemoranda involving the secret U.S. effort to aid the Contras,although it did not contradict Bush's assertions that he never knewabout the diversion of the Iranian arms-sales proceeds to theNicaraguan resistance.</TEXT></DOC>
