 Putting the experiences of humans into aproblem-solving electronic tool is not easy.andM;&quot;Knowledge acquisition is a subjective field of AI [artificial intelligence]and very much in transition from esoteric reasoning to practical,&quot; said AlainRappaport, president, chief scientist and cofounder of Neuron Data, PaloAlto, Calif.andM;There are several reasons why knowledge-based systems are gaining commercialappeal.andP;  First, knowledge-based systems can be used to preserve an otherwiseintangible asset--an expert's knowledge.andP;  Second, they can be used to programbehavior that is difficult to write as a conventional program.andM;Knowledge-based systems serve us well in another way.andP;  Because mostprofessionals are expensive, relieving them of even minor components of theirwork can be a beneficial investment.andP;  Further, when knowledge can be sharedthroughout the organization, in spite of personnel turnover, the value of aknowledge-based system becomes apparent.andM;Yet, despite all the pragmatic attributes of artificial intelligence, makingsubjective reasoning objective is a laborious undertaking.andM;&quot;Experts don't know what they know,&quot; said Elizabeth Cholawsky, regionalsupport manager at AICorp., Waltham, Mass.andP;  Consequently, so-called &quot;experts&quot;find it difficult to articulate the reasoning process behind an action.andM;The people who actually do a task and know exactly what is required to carryit out rarely examine how they did it.andM;&quot;During the knowledge gathering process,&quot; said Cholawsky, &quot;a domain expertwill frequently state, 'I didn't know I did that.'&quot;  Following years ofexperience, the expert dismisses simple tasks as merely rules of thumb.andP;  Thisexplains why humans often cannot explain why or how certain actions resulted.andO;Yet, each decision provides a vital link within the knowledge acquisitionprocess that the developer must interpret.andM;Since domain experts are not often skilled at formalizing their knowledge, aknowledge engineer (the developer) assists the expert in reaching anunderstanding of his/her thought process.andM;Through extensive observation and interviewing, the knowledge engineeranalyzes all aspects of a problem.andP;  To capture an expert's knowledge, eventhe most prosaic decisions must be broken down, analyzed, then encoded stepby step.andP;  Each task, when assessed on a case-by-case basis, becomes amanageable component that forms the underlying structure for the developmentof the expert system.andP;  Frequent test cases help the knowledge engineeruncover any obscure information.andM;In the process of knowledge acquisition, the knowledge engineer and theexpert work together to build an explicit model of the expert's implicitdomain, explained Dr. Bernie Domanski, president and cofounder of DomanskiSciences, Freehold, N.J.andM;Said Domanski, &quot;Interviewing techniques help recreate the stimuli of wherethe expert was when he first learned the task--the original environment.&quot;andM;DEVELOPER'S TOOLS, PROCEDURESandM;Expert system shells are the AI tools that allow developers to buildknowledge-based systems.andP;  The reasoning methods and strategies that mimicdecision-making and problem-solving techniques used by experts arerepresented in the shell.andP;  The knowledge engineer formulates the &quot;if-then&quot;rules of rule-based expert system shells, following the observation of how anexpert works.andM;Cholawsky of AICorp said a knowledge-based system evolves from three phasesof knowledge development.andP;  During the initial phase, the knowledge engineerpainstakingly interviews the subject-knowledge expert to analyze all aspectsof a problem.andP;  As much as 80% of a developer's time may be concentrated inknowledge gathering.andM;The next phase is development.andP;  The knowledge engineer constructs a caseanalysis, encodes the knowledge and tests the system's structure.andP;  Using aniterative approach, the knowledge engineer then develops a prototype.andO;&quot;Essentially, this phase defines the knowledge,&quot; explained Cholawsky.andM;In the final phase, computer feedback to the human expert verifies the&quot;intelligent system.&quot;andP;  Finally, the expert ensures all responses arerepresentative of the task performed prior to implementation.andM;Within a large organization, often no single individual bears soleresponsibility for the complex problem-solving of any one domain.andP;  Multipleexperts, with different perspectives and different priorities, as well asoverlapping areas of expertise, frequently provide input.andP;  The enormity ofthe developer's job, from both a technological standpoint and a humanperspective, becomes clear.andM;Effective &quot;interpersonal skills&quot; are critical to gaining the expert's supportthroughout development.andP;  When multiple experts are involved, the knowledgeengineer must perform &quot;consensus analysis.&quot;andP;  That is, the knowledge engineermust resolve the bits of conflicting information that reside in the minds ofdifferent personalities.andM;Said Alan Fisher, president, Software Partners, Palo Alto, Calif., &quot;Theextraction of knowledge is not a science.andP;  It is an art.&quot;andM;The knowledge engineer also needs interpersonal skills to deal with the&quot;turf&quot; issues.andP;  Often unexpressed, turf issues surface when the domainexperts, typically senior professionals, resent the potential replication oftheir knowledge.andP;  For some professionals, the transfer of their knowledge isanalagous to loss of status.andP;  Lack of the expert's cooperation can prove asevere handicap to knowledge acquisition.andM;Chip Psantes, senior consultant, Andersen Consulting, Washington, advised,&quot;If you don't have expert cooperation, it's extremely difficult to get theknowledge you need.andP;  And you need expert cooperation all the way, frominitial implementation of the project, through to verification and testing.&quot;andM;Because domain experts are often professionals who seek career advancement,these individuals routinely change jobs.andP;  &quot;Relocation,&quot; in this sense,inevitably impedes development.andP;  In the banking industry, this isparticularly true.andM;John Popolizio, vice president, technology specialist, Citibank, New York,said, &quot;The major task we face here is locating the experts.andP;  Our difficultyis in tracking them down.andP;  Most people here don't sit in one job for morethan a year.&quot;andM;Popolizio's group, The National Systems and Technology Division, representsthe bank's technology catalysts.andP;  &quot;Essentially, we are lobbyists for advancedtechnologies,&quot; he explained.andP;  &quot;We are responsible for exposing concepts formore intuitive ways of analyzing customer and account data for marketinganalysis.andP;  Specifically, our group's focus is on customer profiling andsegmentation.andP;  Expert systems are components in the process for which wecombine many technologies.&quot;andM;&quot;Smart&quot; computer programs have not yet replaced humans in most conventionalbusiness applications, nor does it appear they will in the near future.andM;BOTH TEACHER AND ADVISORandM;Instead, knowledge bases appear to best serve humans in an advisory capacity,as an extension to the human mind.andP;  AI applications can automate tasks thathumans must undertake to prepare for a decision process.andP;  Humans can thendevote more time to the thought process.andM;&quot;Knowledge acquisition tools have a fundamental effect of enhancing one's ownknowledge,&quot; said Neuron Data's Rappaport.andP;  &quot;They provide a more intelligentstorage facility for information.andP;  Rules and objects can be formalized in atemplate which may then be dispersed throughout an organization.&quot;andM;In the Investment Banking Sector of Manufacturers Hanover Trust, New York, aknowledge-based system &quot;assists&quot; securities traders in the &quot;buy and sell&quot;process.andP;  In May of 1987, the bank began development on a securities andforeign exchange trading application, the Technical Analysis and ReasoningAssistant (Tara).andP;  Manufacturers Hanover Trust used the Knowledge EngineeringEnvironment (KEE) expert system tool from Intellicorp, Mountain View, Calif.,andO;running on a VAX 3100 workstation.andP;  The implementation proved extremelysuccessful, and the bank plans to &quot;seed&quot; this technology within otherbusiness areas in the near future.andM;Acquiring knowledge from the bank's experts was not easy, however.andP;  StatedBruce Connor, vice president, Investment Banking Sector, &quot;In trading, thereare no clear-cut answers.andP;  A good trader may be right only 65% of the time.andO;Obviously, this leaves a wide margin for error.andP;  Also, each trader has adifferent philosophy in their approach to doing things.andP;  Our system had to betailorable for the individual trader,&quot; said Connor.andM;The bank developed and implemented another expert system, the Inspector, inJanuary 1989.andP;  An auditing tool for off-market trading, the Inspector wasdeveloped using Neuron Data's Nexpert Object, a C-based expert tool, runningon a VAX 3100 workstation.andM;&quot;The idea behind this system was to ensure trades were made for reasonablerates and at reasonable times, while maintaining very large transactionvolumes,&quot; said Connor.andM;Oil field engineers at Schlumberger, Austin, Tex., a worldwide leader in oilfield services and utility measurement systems, directly benefit from theexpert assistance of their knowledge-based system, the Log Quality MonitoringSystem (LQMS).andP;  As copilot, the system's primary task is to enhance theperformance of well-trained field engineers in oil field exploration.andO;Developed during the early 1980s at the Schlumberger Laboratory for ComputerScience, LQMS supplies important oil well geology data to the informationservices division.andM;While most organizations employ the programming talents of a knowledgeengineer to build expert systems, Schlumberger sought an alternatedevelopment approach to designing LQMS.andP;  Using an &quot;expert workbench,&quot; theiroil engineers (the domain experts) created an expert &quot;assistant&quot; on theirown.andP;  This enticed the engineers, who were the ultimate users, to become moredirectly involved, and resulted in a better system.andM;Said Peter Mullarkey, Schlumberger Labs researcher, &quot;Put at the fingertips ofthe expert, the workbench made the bandwidth of information going into thesystem much higher.andP;  And the experts became partners in owning the project.&quot;andM;Mullarkey identified a second key component to the project's success.andP;  Theuse of an integrated knowledge-based edit tracking system within LQMSprovided reassurance to computer-naive experts.andP;  Viewed as a &quot;safety net,&quot;experts could test procedures without damaging the overall system.andP;  Thus, asthe experts' confidence grew, so did a parallel increase in productivity.andM;Serving in a dual role, the edit tracking system also allowed experts locatedaround the world to compare, contrast and integrate changes in a structuredway.andM;According to another Schlumberger Labs researcher, Eric Shoen, &quot;While'mining' the knowledge was a fundamental problem in the creation of thesystem, the edit tracking system greatly enhanced both the speed andconsistency of its development.&quot;andM;A second critical component to knowledge acquisition, and to the resultingLQMS system, is the integration with a graphical user interface.andP;  For thefield engineer, whose task is to acquire, interpret and react to multiplechannels of uncertain data at any given point, time is mission-critical.andM;Many sources can affect the quality of the data.andP;  With the high-performancegraphics front end, problem resolution is increased by a higher, improvedresponse time.andM;Cast in a supportive and subordinate role, a knowledge-based system such asSchlumberger's LQMS, presents a good technological match for the diagnosticapplication.andM;&quot;Whether an expert system becomes an advisor or not is based on the functionof the individual using it,&quot; said Blair Helsing, assistant vice president andproject manager, Bank of America/Credit Card Division, San Francisco.andM;At the Bank of America, an expert system serves as tutor to new employees.andO;&quot;Not only does the expert system ensure a decision is made in the same wayevery time,&quot; said Helsing, &quot;it's also a really great training tool becausethere's much less of a learning curve required.andP;  It used to take six monthsfor a new hire to become proficient, now it only takes two to three months.&quot;andM;During early 1988, the Bank of America's credit card division begandevelopment on a knowledge-based system to realize greater efficiencieswithin its customer service department.andP;  Servicing over four millionindividuals leads to some unmet customer expectations.andP;  The bank receives,and (by law) must respond to, nearly 240,000 letters a year from customerswho may express dissatisfaction in a particular product or service.andM;Now in phase one of its first release, the Automated Customer Service ExpertSystem (ACE) was implemented to resolve wide-rangning customer issues and totrack the status on all pending cases.andP;  This &quot;case&quot; management applicationalso helps the customer service reps prioritize work-in-process.andM;Helsing explained that it now takes more than 30 days to resolve a customerproblem.andP;  Since the bank is bound to the federal banking regulations, manyprocedural steps impede the response process.andP;  The bank's near future goal isto bring the process down to two to three weeks.andP;  According to Helsing, &quot;Thecost savings would be significant.&quot;andM;For the Bank of America, the major challenge was not in acquiring knowledgefrom the experts.andP;  Rather, the challenge focused on how to apply federalbanking regulations to programming logic.andP;  Such regulations require complexdetail in the interpretation of each customer case.andP;  In addition, rapidlychanging laws make it difficult to keep current.andM;According to Helsing, the bank resolved this dilemma using a spreadsheet toolto build a separate matrix, called the Condition-Action Matrix.andP;  On thevertical axis, the condition, or the customer's particular dispute, variableis listed.andP;  Action variables appear on the horizontal axis.andP;  Each cell hasone value; the customer representative plugs in a response of &quot;Yes,&quot; &quot;No,&quot; or&quot;Don't Know.&quot;andM;SmallTalk, an object-oriented programming language from ParcPlace Systems,Mountain View, Calif., links the sum of these conditions together.andP;  SmallTalknavigates the user to the appropriate action.andM;Said Helsing, &quot;The system logic is rigorous when built on a series of thesematrices.&quot;andM;Like Schlumberger's LQMS expert system, ACE serves a diagnostic function.andP;  Itprompts customer service reps to answer questions to resolve customerdisputes about transactions.andP;  But, the expert system, not the user, generatesthe diagnosis, thereby consistently providing an appropriate solution.andM;Within several months, the second phase of ACE/Release 1 will incorporate amainframe interface.andP;  Transaction data can then be downloaded to the expertsystem.andP;  During the third phase, the expert workstations will be integratedto a LAN.andP;  Then all cases can be stored on a file server, so a customerservice manager can review all data at one location.andM;The ACe system is integrated to a graphical user interface and usesPresentation Manager running under OS/2 on an IBM PS/2 Model 70.andM;Some organizations, such as Manufacturers Hanover Trust, are porting theirinternal applications to other business areas.andP;  Others, like Schlumberger,are using subject-matter experts to directly develop their knowledge-basedsystems.andP;  The message to software developers should be clear: Users demandfaster development time in knowledge acquisition.andM;Developers who want to realize a major competitive advantage could start byoffering solid, application-specific tools.andP;  While development on thesevalue-added tools is underway, alternative methods to speed up developmenttime are being investigated, developed and, in some cases, adopted.andM;In Europe, research funded by Esprit, a European economic communityconsortium, and conducted by Bob Wielanga and Joost Breuter, professors atthe Univesity of Amsterdam, the Netherlands, produced a new concept inknowledge acquisition, termed Knowledge Acquisition and DocumentationStructuring (Kads).andM;Kads technology provides models for generic types of medical, industrial andbusiness problems, such as diagnosis, configuration, modeling and control.andO;These models show different types of reasoning within an overallconfiguration.andP;  For example, a model could contain knowledge that wouldtransform informal requirements into formal requirements, or, possibly,knowledge for validating whether a specific configuration was correct.andM;Kads can save precious time in the development cycle.andP;  When an expert's taskis difficult to observe, it is often necessary to ask the expert to verbalizethe decision-making sequence of a problem.andP;  This observation technique istermed &quot;protocol analysis.&quot;andP;  Using Kads, protocol analysis with the expertmay be waived altogether.andM;With Kads, a knowledge engineer can then go to a library of design models andreadily see the types of knowledge that must be acquired, prior tointerviewing the expert.andP;  In addition, applications learned for one model tosolve a particular problem can be carried to the next.andM;Joe Carter, partner, Andersen Consulting, Chicago, said his organizationendorsed the Kads approach to knowledge acquisition by customizing theirversion of it, labeled Model 1, an augumentation of Andersen's Method 1software development methodology.andP;  Carter said they refer to Kads as&quot;directed knowledge acquisition.&quot;andP;  He added, &quot;This methodology structures,organizes and defines the best implementation techniques.andP;  The problempreviously was you would get a metamorphosis of knowledge from the expert.&quot;andM;According to Carter, &quot;Kads modeling techniques can fit into any standardsystems development life cycle.&quot;andM;MONITORING BRAIN WAVESandM;Neural computing is an area of artificial intelligence in which commercialsoftware developers and corporate users are showing increasing interest.andO;This potentially promising technology attempts to mimic the means by whichthe brain receives, processes and interprets input from the outside world.andO;And, software is proving to be one of the best ways to implement it.andM;&quot;Technically speaking, neural computing purports to emulate the way neuronswork within the human brain,&quot; said Carter of Andersen Consulting.andP;  &quot;Thesystem builds a network that can simulate neurons.andP;  When a case is presentedand the result is successful, you will learn through it.andP;  As you train thenetwork, what you are actually doing is knowledge acquisition.&quot;andM;GM Captures Expert KnowledgeandM;Tools help with diagnosis, scheduling, financeandM;For nearly a decade, artificial intelligence (AI) technology has helpedGeneral Motors Corporation maintain its competitive position as one of thisnation's largest automobile manufacturers.andM;Said Ruth Zarger, director of Cognitive Systems/Advanced Engineering staff atGM, Warren, Mich., &quot;This technology signaled a strategic potential to meetGM's business needs.andP;  It allowed scarce expertise to be captured, preservedand improved across the board.&quot;andM;According to Zarger, expert systems now flourish at GM.andP;  Their earliest,single success with an intelligent system can be credited to a GM employeenamed Charley Amble.andP;  Amble was an experienced maintenance engineer who, backin 1987, was widely recognized throughout GM for his ability to identifyproblems in broken machine tools.andP;  Sometimes, Amble recognized problemsbefore they occurred.andM;Amble and the Advanced Engineering Staff worked together to store thisprecious knowledge and developed their first expert system for machine tooldesign.andP;  GM named the system &quot;Charley.&quot;andM;&quot;Apparently, or so the story goes, the expert system was so technicallycapable of identifying problems,&quot; said Zarger, &quot;that even Charley, the humanexpert, was astonished by it.&quot;andM;Designed for diagnosis and preventive maintenance, the system instructs lessexperienced individuals by providing an explanation capability.andP;  ExplainedZarger, &quot;What used to take someone three years to learn, has now been cut tothree months.&quot;andP;  Reduced training costs, greatly attributed to &quot;Charley,&quot; areanticipated to generate GM a savings of $500,000 per year, per plant,according to Zarger.andM;SUCCESS IN SAGINAWandM;GM has implemented another expert system.andP;  Developed via a total automationconcept conceived at GM's &quot;Saginaw Factory of the Future,&quot; Saginaw, Mich., anexpert-based operations scheduling system now automates production schedulingtasks at other GM plants.andM;Said Zarger, &quot;The value of the system is that it automates tasks that weretoo complex when conducted manually.&quot;andP;  Zarger said the system can accommodateequipment maintenance scheduling and machine tool changes.andM;She cited two primary benefits of the Expert System Scheduler.andP;  First, thesystem guarantees reduced inventory levels by generating frequent updates onall work-in-process.andP;  Second, the system can promptly and flexibly respond tochanging customer needs.andM;The Expert System Scheduler uses the Knowledge Engineering Environment (KEE)expert system shell from Intellicorp, Mountain View, Calif., which GM runs onTexas Instruments' Explorer Workstations.andM;Another GM expert-based system, the Dealer Review Analyst, delivers theexpertise to grant or refute auto loans to car dealerships.andP;  According toZarger, the expert system analyzes various risk-associated criteria,including the credit risk involved in any given transaction, the increase ordecrease in risk, the level of financing required and the amount of credit,if applicable, that should be renewed.andM;Zarger said future applications for expert systems, currently underdevelopment, include product engineering.andM;&quot;At GM,&quot; said Zarger, &quot;sharing knowledge signifies a form of recognition, aform of respect.&quot;andP;  She added, &quot;Most individuals seem to enjoy the process[knowledge acquisition].andP;  Cooperation has not been a problem here.andP;  Thedifficulty we've had is in freeing up the expert ...andP;  in having themavailable.&quot;andM;Hodges is a Boston-based market research consultant specializing ininformation systems and environmental sciences.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
