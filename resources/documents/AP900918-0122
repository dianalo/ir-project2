But an independent researcher and authors of the reportpublished in Wednesday's Journal of the American MedicalAssociation cautioned that the finding needs further study.   ``This is the first time anything like this has been found,''said one of the study's authors, Dr. Alex Stagnaro-Green of theendocrinology division of Mount Sinai School of Medicine in NewYork. ``Before women need to start worrying about this, this studywill have to be replicated.''   The report is the first to link miscarriages with the presenceof two thyroid auto-antibodies - thyroglobulin andthyroidperoxidase. An auto-antibody is a type of antibody, butinstead of aiding the body in fighting off disease, it worksagainst it, Stagnaro-Green said.   It's unclear what causes the two thyroid auto-antibodies, butresearchers know they are related to a disfunction in the way theimmune system typically works, he said.   Stagnaro-Green said the study, ``is an important finding in thatit's another instance in which immunological factors have beenlinked to miscarriages.''   Women who test positive for either thyroglobulin andthyroidperoxidase don't suffer from common hormonal disorders suchas an overactive or underactive thyroid, Stagnaro-Green said.   ``It really has nothing to do with the hormonal balance,'' hesaid. ``The only way to tell whether these auto-antibodies arepresent is through a blood test.''   In the study, researchers at Mount Sinai screened 552 women fromseven obstetric practices in New York during their first trimesterand found that 108, or 19.6 percent, tested positive for thyroidauto-antibodies. The rest tested negative.   Researchers then collected information on whether the womencarried the pregnancy to full term. Of the 492 women available forfollow-up, 10.2 percent suffered a miscarriage.   The report said that 8.4 percent who tested negative for theauto-antibodies miscarried. Seventeen percent, or twice the rate,miscarried among women who had tested positive for theauto-antibodies, the report said.   Stagnaro-Green said further studies would have to verify hisresults, and to determine a cause-and-effect.   A doctor not associated with the study agreed.   ``The results of this study are certainly interesting, but alsoneed to be looked at with caution,'' said Dr. Elliot Main, anassistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology who runs areproductive immunology lab at the University of California, SanFrancisco.   Main said the incidence of women who tested positive for theauto-antibodies - nearly 20 percent - was high.   ``One should always be suspicious when that large a share of agroup that is otherwise normal reflects an abnormality,'' he said.``They could suggest some false positives.   Main also said a study needs to address the question of whetherthe process of miscarrying somehow leads to the development ofauto-antibodies, rather than the other way around.</TEXT></DOC>
