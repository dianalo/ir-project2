At the same time, foreign central banks spent about nine times that amount to buttress the dollar in cooperative intervention, a U.S. government official said.    Details of recent central bank activity were disclosed in the Federal Reserve's quarterly intervention report covering the three months ended April 30 and at a news conference Friday. Officials said the intervention took place mainly in late March and April.    The market activity demonstrates the U.S. government's commitment to exchange-rate stability, as expressed in a February agreement with its top economic allies. Washington's commitment to that accord initially was viewed with skepticism in the foreign exchange market.    Officials also disclosed that the U.S., Japan, Canada and seven Western European nations spent a total of $73 billion intervening in various currencies this spring, the most in any comparable period since exchange rates were allowed to float in 1973. About half of the total was spent to support the dollar.    Previously, rumors that the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the U.S. government's agent in currency market intervention, had weighed in heavily this spring were unconfirmed, and levels of foreign central bank intervention weren't known.    Despite the massive intervention effort, the dollar fell 8.4% against the Japanese yen and 2.1% against the West German mark during the three months. That extended the dollar's long slump to two years; the U.S. currency has recovered slightly since the end of April.    A Fed official, however, expressed satisfaction with the effects of the intervention.    &quot;The results were positive. The dollar is relatively stable,&quot; Sam Y. Cross, executive vice president and head of the Fed's foreign exchange operation, said. He said, however, that the success of any intervention &quot;is a matter of judgment because of the question of what would've happened hadn't we been there.&quot;    Although it was generally acting to support the dollar, at one point the Fed intervened against the dollar. When the U.S. unit climbed to 1.8745 marks March 11, the Fed sold $30 million and bought marks, seeking to push the dollar back down.    Mr. Cross denied that the move was meant to enforce a ceiling or target zone for the dollar-mark exchange rate, but the multilateral February agreement was rumored to have set exchange-rate targets. Mr. Cross said the March dollar sale was meant to &quot;foster stability&quot; in the currency markets.    When the dollar fell below 150 yen March 23, the Fed began purchases that amounted to $3.01 billion against the Japanese currency over 11 consecutive business days through April 6, according to its report. The Fed said it bought an additional $956.9 million by selling yen and $99 million by selling marks over six other days in April.    The Fed's effort was bolstered by the Bank of Japan and several European central banks, whose combined dollar purchases were &quot;in multiples of what we did,&quot; Mr. Cross said.    Dollar purchases by foreign central banks in the three months were &quot;in the ballpark&quot; of $37 billion, a U.S. government official who requested anonymity said.    The Fed's intervention was carried out entirely with foreign currencies from its existing reserves.    The disclosures indicate that the Fed's intervention early this year exceeded that for any three months since the period ending January 1981. At that time, the Fed purchased $4.5 billion of marks and Swiss francs to repay U.S.-issued foreign currency bonds.    However, the report doesn't end speculation among market participants that the U.S. may still seek a weaker dollar to help cut the huge trade deficit.    James H. Hohorst, managing director of foreign exchange at Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co., New York, said it is noteworthy that the U.S.'s just-disclosed intervention was small in comparison to what foreign central banks did to brace the dollar.    &quot;I don't think the Fed was fully behind stopping the dollar's decline,&quot; Mr. Hohorst said. In any case, he added, &quot;it suited them to intervene in support of the dollar at the time and they could change their minds anytime.&quot;    ---   Friday's Currency Activity   The dollar ended higher against most major currencies but below its intraday highs.    Dealing was thin most of the day, as many traders said they wouldn't open large new positions after squaring positions for the month's end, the weekend and the seven-nation economic summit in Venice beginning next Monday.    In late New York trading, the dollar stood at 1.8205 West German marks, compared with 1.8170 late Thursday. The U.S. currency also climbed to 143.83 Japanese yen from 143.35. The British pound firmed to $1.6313 from $1.6288.    Traders said the dollar received support from the Japanese government's approval of measures to stimulate economic growth.    Traders continue to have mixed views on the dollar's near-term direction. Leslie A. Puth, a trader for Banque Indosuez in New York, said the dollar started last week with a big rally Tuesday, then spent the rest of the week trying to hang on to its gains. As a result, she predicts the dollar will weaken and perhaps test the 1.8080 mark level.    However, Tom Benfer, a trader for Bank of Montreal in New York, says the dollar is still showing some technical strength because it didn't weaken much last week. He says it's likely the dollar will rise to test the 1.83 mark level.    On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell $3.20 an ounce to $450.20 in moderate trading. Estimated volume was four million ounces.    ---                    LATE NEW YORK TRADING                     Friday, May 29, 1987   Based on average of late afternoon buying and sellingrates.
