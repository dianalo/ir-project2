The court, over two dissenting votes, let stand an AlabamaSupreme Court ruling that such car buyers can sue even if theysigned contracts saying all disputes will be referred to bindingarbitration.   Justices Byron R. White and Harry A. Blackmun voted to heararguments in the case, but four votes are needed to grant suchreview.   Jack and Juanita Warren, residents of St. Clair County, Ala.,sued a Birmingham car dealership, Jim Skinner Ford Inc., in 1987after experiencing what they said were numerous problems with thenew car they had bought three months before.   The sales contract the Warrens had signed called for bindingarbitration of any dispute.   Jim Skinner Ford immediately sought to freeze the lawsuit untilarbitration was completed, contending such action was requiredunder the Federal Arbitration Act.   In past decisions, the nation's highest court has ruled that thefederal law precludes a state court proceeding over an allegedbreach of contract if the disputed contract affected interstatecommerce and contained an arbitration clause.   A state trial judge granted the dealership's request but lastJuly 7 the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that the federal law did notrequire freezing the Warrens' lawsuit.   The state court said the sale of a car by an Alabama dealer toAlabama residents is not covered by the federal arbitration lawbecause the two contracting parties did not comtemplate``substantial interstate activity.''   In the appeal acted on today, lawyers for Jim Skinner Fordargued that Congress never intended the federal law to be sonarrowly confined.   The appeal was supported in a ``friend-of-the-court'' briefsubmitted by two associations representing over 1,000 cardealerships in Alabama. They said the state Supreme Court rulingdeprives car dealers of their right to enforce arbitrationagreements.   Lawyers for the Warrens urged the justices to reject the appeal.   They said the federal arbitration law's provisions ``never wereintended to apply to contracts ... involving the consumer purchaseof a product by a citizen of one state from a retailer residing inthe same state.''   The case is Jim Skinner Ford vs. Warren, 89-567.</TEXT></DOC>
