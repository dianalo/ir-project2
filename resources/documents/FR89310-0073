The proposed revision would allow the licenseeto: (1) revise the toxic gas monitor ESF actuation logic to provide anactuation signal on a two-out-of-two logic for monitor failure insteadof a one-out-of-two logic as exists in the present design (the high toxicgas actuation of one-out-of-two is retained); (2) provide separate powersupplies from non-Class 1E uninterruptable sources to each monitor; (3)provide a separate control room annuciator for ``High Toxic Gas Concentration''and ``Monitor Trouble''; (4) relocate the sample intake duct nearer thebuilding entrance to reduce the volume of toxic gas which would enter thecontrol room before the isolation dampers close; (5) delete hydrazine fromthe FSAR and TS as a monitored/isolated actuation chemical because controlroom habitability calculations demonstrate that the control room operatorswill not be incapacitated by a postulated hydrazine spill; (6) increasethe setpoint for the ammonia channel in the FSAR and TS to 25 parts permillion (ppm) because the revised calculations utilizing techniques inNUREG/CR-1741 demonstrate the operators would have adequate time to donbreathing apparatus after a toxic gas release before becoming incapacitated;(7) revise the TS response time from 25 seconds to 5 seconds for isolationupon a high toxic gas signal (a total of 80 seconds is allowed to isolatethe control room when setpoint concentrations are reached at the monitorsample point in the duct); and (8) revise the FSAR to add acetaldehydeas a monitored chemical.Therefore, the proposed changes do not increase the probability or consequencesof accidents, no changes are being made in the types of any effluents thatmay be released offsite, and there is no significant increase in the allowableindividual or cumulative occupational radiation exposure. Accordingly,the Commission concludes that this proposed action would result in no significantradiological environmental impact.With regard to potential non-radiological impacts, the proposed changeto the TS involves systems located within the restricted area as definedin 10 CFR Part 20. It does not affect non-radiological plant effluentsand has no other environmental impact. Therefore, the Commission concludesthat there are no significant non-radiological environmental impacts associatedwith the proposed amendment.The Notice of Consideration of Issuance of Amendment and Opportunity forHearing in connection with this action was published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on September 12, 1988 (53 FR 35245). No requestfor hearing or petition for leave to intervene was filed following thisnotice.Alternative to the Proposed ActionSince the Commission concluded that there are no significant environmentaleffects that would result from the proposed action, any alternatives withequal or greater environmental impacts need not be evaluated.The principal alternative would be to deny the requested amendment. Thiswould not reduce environmental impacts of plant operation and would resultin reduced operational flexibility.Alternative Use of ResourcesThis action involves no use of resources not previously considered in theFinal Environmental Statement (NUREG-1171) for the South Texas Project,Units 1 and 2.Agencies and Persons ConsultedThe NRC staff reviewed the licensee's request and did not consult otheragencies or persons.<ITAG tagnum="84">Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>The Commission has determined not to prepare an environmental impact statementfor the proposed license amendment.Based upon the foregoing environmental assessment, we conclude that theproposed action will not have a significant effect on the quality of thehuman environment.For further details with respect to this action, see the application foramendment dated March 8, 1988 which is available for public inspectionat the Commission's Public Document Room, 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC, and at the Wharton Junior College Library, J.M.
