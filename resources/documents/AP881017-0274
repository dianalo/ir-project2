The fight over Unix has dismayed computer users, who are leftundecided about which rival version of Unix they should adopt astheir own. Programs that work with one version of Unix may not workwith the other.   Several companies involved in the high-stakes tussle areplanning to issue a statement Tuesday rallying around AmericanTelephone andamp; Telegraph Co.'s version of Unix, the weekly tradenewspaper Computerworld said in Monday's editions.   Such a group would be a rival to the Open Software Foundation,which includes such giants as International Business MachinesCorp., Digital Equipment Corp. and Hewlett-Packard Co.   Although ATandamp;T invented Unix, members of the Open SoftwareFoundation say its development should be controlled by anindustrywide organization so ATandamp;T does not have an unfair advantagewith it.   ATandamp;T has said it will not join the Open Software Foundationunless it uses ATandamp;T's version of Unix as the core of a newoperating system. But the foundation is sticking with plans to useIBM software as the core.   Robert Kavner, president of ATandamp;T's Data Systems Group, toldComputerworld that ATandamp;T and 10 other companies will form a group todevelop jointly future versions of Unix.   ATandamp;T spokesman Dick Muldoon confirmed the accuracy of thearticle, although he said Kavner has denied that the new group isintended to counter the influence of the rival Open SoftwareFoundation.   Kavner would not identify the companies that would belong to thenew Unix group, but said candidates would include Unisys Corp., NCRCorp., Amdahl Corp., Ing. C. Olivetti andamp; Co. SpA, Sun MicrosystemsInc., Fujitsu America Inc. and others.   NCR spokesman Kelly Kramer said there were tentative plans forsome kind of joint statement by several companies on Tuesday. Hesaid he did not know what it might say.</TEXT></DOC>
