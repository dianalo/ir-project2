The so-called Paris Club of government creditors -- which includes the U.S., Japan and the main West European powers -- told Brazil in a letter delivered in the past few days that it wouldn't roll over payments falling due in the second half of 1987, as it had done for the first half, a source close to the Paris Club said. The letter also said that Brazil would have to speed up its overdue payments for the first half of the year, the same source said.    The new proposal, presented to banks last Friday, asks for $10.4 billion in bank loans and no interest-rate margin on the country's medium-term and long-term bank debt, while suggesting the replacement of some of that debt with tradeable bonds.    As reported, the country's 14 major bank lenders reacted coolly to the proposal, saying in a telex message sent to all of Brazil's bank creditors Friday that &quot;many important points aren't addressed by the proposal or are only treated generally.&quot;    Yesterday, banking sources said the chairmen of 12 of Brazil's major creditor banks met here Sunday afternoon and agreed that they should take &quot;a firm but reasonable&quot; line in current negotiations with Brazil. &quot;We felt we have to be firm because the Brazilians are running large trade surpluses and building up their reserves,&quot; said a banking source. &quot;There's no reason why Brazil should get the kind of concessions they're asking for,&quot; he added.    The chairmen apparently were concerned that Brazil's requests for new loans contained in its new proposal are based on its projected interest bill and aren't founded on an economic program, banking sources said. But the banks generally say they are eager &quot;to negotiate&quot; and &quot;keep the door open,&quot; as some bankers put it.    The committee of 14 major creditor banks, which negotiates Brazil's foreign bank debt, will meet with Brazilian debt negotiators in New York on Friday.    Meanwhile, Mr. Bresser Pereira said he was pleased by his meeting with Mr. Baker. He repeated Mr. Baker's statement that Brazil's new proposal was worthy of consideration, and said Mr. Baker considers the proposal &quot;a starter.&quot; Brazil's previous, more-radical proposal was dropped earlier this month after Mr. Baker rejected it as a &quot;nonstarter.&quot;    Mr. Baker also said yesterday that he thought Brazil's negotiations with its bank creditors and any agreement it might make with the International Monetary Fund could be &quot;separate issues.&quot; The banks want to link any debt restructuring for Brazil to an IMF-monitored economic program, but Mr. Bresser Pereira has insisted that he would only be prepared to negotiate with the IMF after reaching an accord with the banks.    However, some Western government leaders had unwelcome advice for Brazil. France's minister of economy and finance, Edouard Balladur, said &quot;it's necessary for Brazil to go to the Fund,&quot; meaning the IMF, although he also termed Brazil's new debt proposal &quot;ingenious.&quot;    The debt problems of Brazil and many other developing nations are a focus of this week's annual meetings of the IMF and World Bank here. In a communique released yesterday, the IMF's policy-making interim committee said the resolution of world debt problems depends on a combination of &quot;sustained growth-oriented adjustment in debtor countries, access to (international) finance, policies in industrial countries that will secure stable world financial conditions and open and growing markets.&quot;    The communique also was implicitly critical of Brazil when it said that &quot;unilateral initiatives carry heavy risks for all parties.&quot; Brazil unilaterally suspended interest payments on an estimated $67 billion of foreign bank debt on Feb. 20. </TEXT></DOC>
