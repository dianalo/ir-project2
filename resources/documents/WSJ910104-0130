Inc. The banks would rake in $20 million infees and receive a generous interest rate, besides havingseemingly ample collateral in case things went wrong.   But now the bank debt of Revco, the first giant leveragedbuy-out to become mired in bankruptcy proceedings, isbeginning to resemble a troubled loan to a less-developedcountry. Although the discount-drugstore chain has paid offmore than $225 million of the original loan, it is takingsuch a beating that the assets serving as collateral may notbe worth as much as the remaining bank debt. Some Revco loansare changing hands at 60 cents on the dollar -- not exactly avote of confidence that the banks will come out whole.</LP><TEXT>   The banks' claim on Revco assets was dealt a new blow thisweek when a bankruptcy-court examiner said the banks could besued and might lose the collateral and their fees as well.   For banks that pumped $50 billion into corporate stockbuy-outs and restructurings in the late 1980s and reaped bigprofits, Revco and a growing number of other troubled dealsare testing the notion that senior secured lenders areusually safe, no matter what happens.   &quot;There are plenty of examples where a year ago bankersswore up and down that their loans were worth 100 cents onthe dollar, but today that paper trades actively at muchlower levels,&quot; says Christopher R. Ryan, a Salomon Brotherstrader.   He notes that Federated Department Stores loans are &quot;a45-cent piece of paper&quot; and that loans for the buy-out ofInterco Inc., the St. Louis footwear and furniture maker, aretrading in the 50-cent to 55-cent range. He says many loansare below par because the market perceives that the loan'scollateral is worth less than its face value or that thebanks may be forced to give up some principal or interest.   &quot;In this environment, where assets decline sosignificantly, being senior and secure does not cut itanymore,&quot; says Andrew Herenstein, a senior analyst atDelaware Bay Co., which trades in distressed bank loans.   The outlook has grown bleaker for several reasons: Highlyleveraged transactions, by their very nature, leave littleroom for error, and as the economy slows, more and morecompanies don't have enough income to service all their debt.Moreover, asset sales that could be used to pay down debt aredisappointing. Bondholders, knowing that the debtor companiescan't find new financing very easily, are pushing banks toshare with them the pain of a debt restructuring.   Bankers themselves still contend that portfolios ofhighly-leveraged-transaction loans aren't in much danger. AtCiticorp, which had $7.8 billion of HLT loans on its books asof Sept. 30, Todd Slotkin, a senior managing director, sayshe is &quot;comfortable&quot; with the prospects for repayment.Although &quot;there are industries with particular problems,there is not a wholesale decline across the board,&quot; he adds.   And Robert O'Brien, a managing director of Bankers TrustCo., applauds the development of a loan-sale market in the1980s. With scores of banks participating in giant loans,&quot;money-center banks diversified their risk in a way not seenwith real-estate investment trusts in the 1970s orless-developed country loans.&quot; His bank, which has about $3.3billion of HLT loans, has about $20 million in each, so a lotof deals would have to sour for its portfolio to be severelyaffected.   It's hard to figure which banks are more vulnerable to HLTlosses. Analysts say some may already have reduced earningsby setting up loan-loss reserves for their riskiest credits.Besides, the collateral varies greatly from loan to loan, andbanks aren't required to disclose it.   In any event, banks generally aren't as much at risk inHLTs as in commercial real estate; their collateral isstronger and more salable, and their exposure is smaller andmore diversified. HLT collateral can be payments due fromcustomers, plant and equipment, or (as with most largebuy-outs) stock in subsidiaries.   &quot;HLTs will not be the event that shuts out the lights atany institution,&quot; says Allerton G. Smith, a First Bostonanalyst.   However, he found it &quot;a little bit alarming&quot; that in thethird quarter at least five of the 37 banks he surveyed hadmore than 10% of their HLT loans on nonperforming status, upfrom two the previous quarter. In some cases, such as BankersTrust, Citicorp and Continental Bank, he says, total HLTloans exceeded 100% of the banking company's common equity.   Indeed, a rise in HLT losses is growing more likely justwhen banks can least afford them. Christopher T. Mahoney, avice president at Moody's Investors Service, expects 25% ofall HLT loans to eventually become nonperforming. Of thisdollar amount, he anticipates that the banks will lose 25% to40% of their loan commitments, up from the 10% he hadpreviously estimated. In addition, banks face large legal andaccounting bills for HLTs that end up in bankruptcy court.   Pushing more companies to restructure debt, either in orout of bankruptcy proceedings, is the surge in payments sooncoming due on more than $40 billion of junk bonds. Some areto be reset with sharply higher interest rates; others haveall their principal and past interest coming due at once. C.Richard Lehmann, who edits the Defaulted Bonds newsletter,expects as many as 120 companies to default on bonds in 1991,up from a record 90 in 1990. He estimates that 145 highlyleveraged companies have $73 billion in junk-bond debt and$50 billion in bank debt.   Mr. Smith of First Boston says bankers are increasinglyworried that regulators will make them set up loan-lossreserves even for HLT loans current on interest andamortization. Applying this so-called performingnonperforming loan idea to HLTs would further depress bankearnings.   A spokeswoman for the Comptroller of the Currency declinesto discuss the agency's examination approach for HLTs otherthan to say, &quot;Bank exposure to HLTs is not life-threatening.Obviously what happens in the economy will be something wewill watch closely.&quot;   When trouble starts, ailing companies find little room tonegotiate with banks for debt relief, says E. TheodoreStolberg, a partner of Weiss, Peck andamp; Greer, an investmentfirm that buys such companies. When a company approaches thelead lender, he explains, the lender &quot;kicks open the door andintroduces it to 300 snarling banks who took a piece of theloan. And many of them don't speak English.&quot;   And bondholders aren't very accommodating, either, Mr.Mahoney says, since the LTV Corp. bankruptcy proceedingsshowed that they couldn't lay claim to their original deal ifthey made concessions prior to a bankruptcy filing.   Bankruptcies are like &quot;a Bataan death march&quot; for bankloans, Mr. Stolberg says. As in the prolonged bankruptcyproceedings of Eastern Airlines, he says, &quot;Collateral justkeeps dropping off the side while lawyers' fees pile up monthafter month and revenues slide.&quot;   Then, just when an agreement seems near, Mr. Stolbergsays, the group learns that &quot;some arbitrager has bought achunk of the distressed junk bonds and it will take anothersix to nine months to bring him around to the deal.Meanwhile, back at the ranch, the collateral is eroding.&quot;   Interco, which some analysts think is on the brink offiling for protection against creditors, could be in for aprolonged, contentious bankruptcy case. One disgruntledbondholder says the only deal he and some other largeinvestors would accept would be for some 60 banks to grant animmediate reduction in their $800 million loan. However, heacknowledges, &quot;There's no way there will be agreement amongthat many banks.&quot;   Interco saddled itself with billions of dollars of newdebt to fend off a takeover in 1988. But its businessessagged. And, despite paying down debt by selling $1 billionof assets, including the Ethan Allen furniture company, ithasn't been able to meet all its interest and principalpayments.   Negotiations are continuing, lawyers and advisers say,about reducing interest and possibly forgiving part of thebank loan if future profit targets aren't met. With such anagreement, a prepackaged bankruptcy accord might be arrangedthat would allow Interco to emerge from bankruptcyproceedings faster than usual.   Bondholders are getting tougher and tougher about pushingbanks to take big reductions in principal and interest so asto avoid a lengthy bankruptcy case that will erode thecollateral. The chief credit officer of a money-center banksays &quot;bondholders are much more argumentative and willing totake a company into bankruptcy.&quot; He adds that banks' seniorcreditor status puts them at odds with bondholders, who havea &quot;diametrically opposed position.&quot;   In some cases, bankers have already taken the hit on loansto troubled HLTs. Banks led by Manufacturers Hanover TrustCo. surrendered rights to $100 million of a $275 million loanto Seaman Furniture Co. in return for a minority interest inthe Long Island, N.Y., retailer. And Bankers Trust isbelieved to have written off $20 million to $30 million of abuy-out loan to Magnet PLC, a British kitchen-fixture companyhurt by a weak economy and soaring interest rates when it wasexpanding rapidly.   At present, Revco, which filed for protection fromcreditors in mid-1988, is one of the troubled HLT dealsgetting the most attention. Its bank-loan collateral, whichsome analysts believe isn't worth the bank loans, includesinventory, fixtures, leases on stores and cash on hand.   In the original buy-out, 11 banks put up $535 million inloans. Through amortization and asset sales, the loan hasbeen reduced to $306 million. Wells Fargo isn't commenting,but it is believed to have about $80 million of its original$141.5 million loan still outstanding. And Marine Midlandsays it now holds less than $25 million of its original$117.9 million. Estimating how much might be on any givenbank's books is difficult because the lender, which typicallydeclines to comment, may have sold off portions of the debtto other banks.   Another closely watched HLT is Federated, the retailertaken private by Robert Campeau. Its $2 billion inoutstanding bank loans, spread among 50 or more banks, iscollateralized by stock in subsidiary stores, such asBloomingdale's, and liens approved by the bankruptcy court onreal property. &quot;Senior lenders think they will get theirprincipal back and 100% of their interest. That may not bethe case,&quot; Delaware Bay's Mr. Herenstein says.   The weak retailing market has depressed the stores' value,he says. And, after February, when an agreement with thecompany runs out, interest payments could cease because,under a legal provision called &quot;post-petition interest,&quot;those payments can continue during bankruptcy proceedingsonly if the court determines that the collateral still equalsat least the value of the loan. Mr. Slotkin of Citicorp, thelead lender, sees a &quot;good&quot; chance that the Federated loanswill continue to be repaid with interest.   Bankers who lent money to William Farley's WPP AcquisitionCo. so it could take over West Point-Pepperell have alreadyseen the danger of taking stock as collateral. WestPoint-Pepperell's stock at the time was $58 a share. Theremaining 5% of the shares still outstanding are tradingtoday at about $21, and WPP Acquisition is in default on $796million of bank debt, Mr. Herenstein says.   Lawsuits or the threat of them could induce bankers tomake sacrifices. In the Revco bankruptcy case, BarryZaretsky, the court examiner, concluded that fraudulentconveyance, a concept from English common law, could beapplied to leveraged buy-outs. That would mean, lawyers say,that creditors other than banks can claim first rights to thecollateral. It is based on the principle that the deal was sohighly leveraged that it rendered the company insolvent orwith unreasonably low capital at the time of the transaction.Besides collateral, fees earned by bankers, lawyers andothers in the deal -- as much as $80 million in the case ofRevco -- might also have to be returned to the company.   Wilbur Ross, a senior managing director of Rothschild Inc.who advises bondholders, adds that another legal principle,called &quot;equal and ratable,&quot; is also being used to challengebanks' rights to collateral. Interco's original bondholders,before the buy-out, believe that they should have shared inthe $1 billion from asset sales that have paid down bank debtsince the buy-out. The application of that legal challenge isunder study in several similar situations, and &quot;it's a wholenew problem, in some ways worse for banks than fraudulentconveyance,&quot; Mr. Ross says.   The combination of a weak economy, truculent bondholders,tighter loan examinations and new legal challenges will leadmore banks to try to sell their most highly leveraged loans,analysts say. But although banks are &quot;becoming morerealistic&quot; about selling off the potentially troubled loansat 80 cents and 85 cents on the dollar, &quot;the market can'tabsorb all the bank debt,&quot; Mr. Herenstein says.   The secondary loan market is limited mostly to other banksand the so-called vulture funds, Salomon's Mr. Ryan says,partly because direct ownership of a loan makes the buyer acorporate insider subject to regulatory constraint on othersecurities activities. Salomon is trying to expand the HLTloan market to traditional institutional investors bypackaging the loans as a trust free of insider status.   But in the six months or so that the firm has been pushingthe idea, Mr. Ryan says, &quot;institutional interest has beensluggish.&quot;   ---                                                                                                             Exposures, in billions as a percent of total loans                                                                                                                                             HIGHLY              COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE  LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS                                                                                                                     IN BILLIONS % OF LOANS  IN BILIONS % OF LOANS                                                                                                        Bank of N.Y.     $1.6       4.6%        $4.5       12.9 Bankers Trust     2.6      12.7          3.3       16.3 Chase   Manhattan       9.5      12.2          4.6        6.0 Chemical          6.7      14.8          3.2        7.0 Citicorp         13.2       8.3          7.8        4.9 Man.
