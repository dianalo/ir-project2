Anderson, the AssociatedPress correspondent held hostage in Lebanon.   The appeal was issued by the federation's secretary general,Farid Ayyar, after he returned from the 17th annual meeting of thefederation's general assembly in Damascus, the Syrian capital. Thefederation consists of 17 Arab news agencies.   Anderson, 41, chief Middle East correspondent for The AssociatedPress, was kidnapped in west Beirut March 16, 1985. Islamic Jihad, aShiite Moslem group loyal to Iran, has claimed it holds Anderson,who has been a captive longer than any other foreign hostage inLebanon.   ``The general assembly discussed the question of Terry Anderson'scontinued abduction and resolved that this is hampering thepublication of Arab news abroad and curbing the freedom of the pressin general,'' Ayyar said in a statement.   ``We appeal to Terry Anderson's holders to reconsider theirposition because the AP bureau chief was conducting a professionalmission without any involvement in the existing conflicts,'' Ayyarsaid.   He urged ``all influential forces in Lebanon to act forAnderson's speedy release'' and called on all journalists'organizations worldwide to help bring this about.   In addition to Anderson, at least 14 foreigners are believed heldhostage in Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
