COLEMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Patrick Reynolds, grandson of tobacco magnateR.J. Reynolds, is pouring his anti-smoking fervor into abehavior-modification kit to help people kick the habit.   Reynolds said in an interview Saturday he has set upheadquarters in Chicago for his business, the Reynolds Stop SmokingProgram, which sells kits bearing the same name.   The kit, being test-marketed in 20 cities, contains audiocassettes, a workbook and a 30-day supply of beta carotene, anaturally occurring nutrient that some studies have suggested mayreduce lung cancer risk, he said.   The kit is just the latest effort by Reynolds, 39, who hasbecome an increasingly active anti-smoking campaigner since he gaveup cigarettes four years ago. He has promoted his message intelevision talk show appearances, letters to the president and incongressional testimony.   His efforts attracted the attention of the World HealthOrganization, which honored Reynolds at a Washington ceremonyFriday along with other activists including Victoria Brynner,daughter of lung cancer victim Yul Brynner, actor Larry Hagman andformer President Jimmy Carter.   Reynolds' motive is a very personal one.   ``My grandfather, R.J. Reynolds, helped popularize smoking inAmerica ... and I want to do everything I can, now that we know howdangerous it is, to help people stop,'' he said Saturday.   Reynolds said his only memories of his father, R.J. ReynoldsJr., are ``of a man lying down gasping for breath.   ``He died of emphysema at 58 ... caused by his cigarette habit,when I was 15.''   Though Reynolds took up the habit four years later, ``for theusual reasons, wanting to attract older girls and so on,'' hestopped in 1984 and became ``increasingly disturbed about what wasgoing on.   ``And I found that cigarettes, for example, were the mostheavily advertised products in all of America. Tobacco companieswere spending over $2 billion a year advertising cigarettes. Thatamounts to $8 a year for every man, woman and child in thiscountry.''   Believing cigarette companies target their ads at the young,Reynolds testified in 1986 before Congress in favor of a ban on allcigarette advertising.   He said he also has pushed for raising cigarette taxes, banningsmoking on airplanes and enacting tough clean indoor air laws, andhas endorsed a project to support product liability lawsuitsagainst tobacco companies.   Calls to the Tobacco Institute in Washington on Sunday were notanswered. The tobacco industry claims no link between smoking anddisease has ever been proven.   Reynolds' activities have drawn criticism from his siblings, whohave claimed his campaign is a publicity stunt. The tobacco heirhas just completed a book about his family, due out next year withthe tentative title, ``The Gilded Leaf: Three Generations of theR.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company and Fortune.''   But Reynolds said he has given up his acting career, whichincluded a number of television appearances and the lead role inthe science fiction movie ``Eliminators,'' to devote all of histime to anti-smoking activities.   In his new venture, he said he has sold about 11,000 of hisbehavior-modification kits at $19.88 each since he began marketingthem last Christmas through a toll-free telephone number advertisedon television. He also plans to market the kits to corporations andhospitals.   The man who inherited $2.5 million from his grandfather when heturned 21 but later sold his stock in RJR Nabisco Inc., theconglomerate that runs the family tobacco company, said he plans todonate a substantial portion of the profit from the kits to theAmerican Lung Association, American Cancer Society and otheranti-smoking groups.   Reynolds serves as a ``roving ambassador'' for the American LungAssociation, spokeswoman Elaine Chapnick said Sunday.   But she said Reynolds' stop-smoking kit has not been evaluatedby the association, which sells its own kit containing a videotape,audiotape and workbook for $59.95 through local lung associations.</TEXT></DOC>
