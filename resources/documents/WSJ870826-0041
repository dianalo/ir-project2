Therese, Quebec, by tomorrow if Canada's rail strike doesn't end.    It is one of many closures expected as a result of a strike by more than 47,000 unionized workers at Canada's two major railroads, government-owned Canadian National Railways and CP Rail, a unit of Montreal-based Canadian Pacific Ltd.    Late yesterday, the federal government gave notice that it will introduce back-to-work legislation if a final attempt to reach a settlement in the contract dispute fails. The strike, which began Sunday, has stopped passenger rail traffic and about 30% of Canada's freight transport, including shipment of most grain, coal, forest products and sulfur.    Labor Minister Pierre Cadieux appointed the government's senior negotiator, William Kelly, to assist in the negotiations. Unresolved issues include wages and job seniority.    A spokeswoman for GM Canada, a unit of General Motors Corp., said the Ste. Therese plant's 3,500 hourly workers would be laid off because of a looming parts shortage. The plant makes Chevrolet Celebrity cars.    A Ford Motor Co. of Canada spokesman said the company's auto assembly plant at St. Thomas, Ontario, is operating on &quot;a day-to-day basis&quot; because of parts shortages.    Ford Canada, 92%-owned by Ford Motor Co., was forced to fly a supply of car doors from a Chicago stamping plant to Detroit and then truck them to St. Thomas to keep the plant operating, the spokesman said. The facility is the sole North American source of Ford Crown Victoria and Mercury Grand Marquis full-sized cars. Other Ford Canada plants have switched shipments to truck from rail, he said.    Richard Marshall, president of the Coal Association of Canada, said 5,000 coal miners would be laid off &quot;within days&quot; if the strike isn't settled, because some mines don't have the capacity to stockpile coal.    A spokesman for the Canadian Wheat Board said the impact is already being felt on Canada's West Coast, where some vessels have had to depart without full loads. Other vessels will have to wait until rail transport resumes, he said. The agency normally ships about 75,000 metric tons of grain a day by rail to Canadian ports, he said.    The strike has also resulted in suspension of service by Via Rail Canada Inc., the government-owned intercity passenger rail concern, and by commuter rail services in Toronto and Montreal. Service on these lines depends on crews of the two railways to assure operations. A Via Rail spokesman said the strike had forced the layoff of 4,000 of its 6,000 employees.    Yesterday, Mr. Kelly, the government mediator, met separately with union leaders and with railroad management in an attempt to reach a settlement. The previous contract expired Dec. 31. </TEXT></DOC>
