(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A federal bankruptcy judge has ruled thatPTL should be repaid nearly $200,000 of the $363,700 it spent tobuy the silence of Jessica Hahn, whose sexual encounter with JimBakker led to his downfall.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds said PTL is owed $160,000in principal and interest from a $150,000 trust fund theevangelical empire set up for the former church secretary in 1985in return for her promise not to talk about the liaison.   Los Angeles lawyer Scott Furstman already has agreed to return$39,000 of a $50,000 retainer PTL paid him to administer the trustfund.   Reynolds entered the judgment on Tuesday against Ms. Hahn andFurstman.   Reynolds' ruling came the same day that PTL bankruptcy trusteeM.C. ``Red'' Benton said contributions have declined drastically.   In the past four weeks, PTL has received an average of $32,000 aday in donations, or 47 percent of contributions for the sameperiod a year ago, Benton said.   In an effort to keep PTL's religious broadcasting going untilthe Heritage USA Christian theme park is sold, a new entity calledHeritage Ministries will begin July 29. It will pay PTL $242,000 amonth for broadcast time on the PTL satellite network and for renton PTL's studios and church buildings.   PTL sued Ms. Hahn and Furstman for the hush money in April,claiming Ms. Hahn broke her agreement with PTL by talking about her1980 encounter with Bakker at a hotel in Clearwater Beach, Fla.   Ms. Hahn last year sold her story _ illustrated with semi-nudephotos of herself _ to Playboy for a reported $1 million.   Ms. Hahn, who recently moved out of the Playboy Mansion in LosAngeles and lives in a hotel there, never replied to the suit. Sheand Paul Roper, her representative in the 1985 transaction, havesaid they did not realize the money was PTL's, rather than Bakker'spersonal money, and that they felt guilty about taking it.   Furstman was hired by PTL in 1985 to help in dealings with Ms.Hahn.   The Hahn transaction, as well as other of Bakker's financialdealings at PTL, are the subject of a federal grand juryinvestigation into possible tax fraud.   An IRS report filed in bankruptcy court in December said PTL'spayments in the Hahn incident included the $150,000 trust fund; a$115,000 payment to Roper, who gave $20,000 to Ms. Hahn; $85,000 inlegal fees to Furstman, and $10,000 paid to Ms. Hahn in 1984 forher signature on a statement absolving Bakker of wrongdoing.   Ms. Hahn received monthly interest from the trust fund from 1985until PTL stopped the payments in 1987. Her tax returns indicateshe received $10,000 in 1985. Under the judge's orders, she doesnot have to repay that money.</TEXT></DOC>
