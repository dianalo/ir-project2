JOB BIAS</TEXT><TEXT>      The court dealt a blow to minorities who contend they arevictims of on-the-job discrimination, making it easier foremployers to refute claims of racial bias based on statisticalevidence.   The 5-4 ruling said when minorities allege that statistics showthey are victims of bias, employers do not have to prove theirpractice is non-discriminatory, only that there is a legitimatereason for apparently neutral business practices.   In a sharply worded dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens said theruling ``retreats'' from 18 years of court decisions aimed athelping minorities who are victimized by discrimination that may beunintentional.   The case is Wards Cove vs. Atonio, 87-1387.      SCIENTOLOGISTS-TAXES</TEXT><TEXT>      In a defeat for the Church of Scientology, the justices upheldthe Internal Revenue Service's contention that contributions called``fixed donations'' made to the church by its members are notcharitable contributions that can be counted as federal income taxdeductions.   The 5-2 vote rejected the Scientologists' argument that the IRShad singled out their church for unfair treatment.   The cases are Herandez vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue,87-963, and Graham vs. Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 87-1616.      SCULPTURE-COPYRIGHT</TEXT><TEXT>      The court ruled 9-0, in a victory for artists and authors, thata homeless-rights group, the Community for Creative Non-Violence,does not own exclusively the copyright to a sculpture itcommissioned an artist to create.   The justices ordered further lower court hearings to determinewhether the CCNV and its founder, Mitch Snyder, may share in thecopyright of a work by James Earl Reid of Baltimore entitled``Third World America'' that depicts the plight of the homeless.   The case is Community for Creative Non-Violence vs. Reid, 88-293.      MILKEN</TEXT><TEXT>      The court, without comment, cleared the way for trial of agovernment lawsuit against junk bond specialist Michael Milken andremoved a major obstacle to a $650 million payment by his formeremployer, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc., to investors and the federaltreasury.   The justices rejected the appeal by Milken and two co-defendantsto disqualify U.S. District Judge Milton Pollack in New York Cityfrom their case. The defendants had contended Pollack had anapparent conflict of interest because his wife is receiving $30million from the sale of a corporation in which Drexel BurnhamLambert helped set up the financing.   The case is Milken vs. SEC, 88-1628.      CATARACTS-MEDICARE</TEXT><TEXT>      The court left intact a federal law that generally prohibitsMedicare patients from using their own money to pay for assistantsurgeons in eye cataract operations.   Without comment, the court upheld the 1986 law that preventedsuch payments by Medicare patients unless the services wereapproved by an insurance carrier or a state committee that reviewssuch medical costs.   The case is New York Opthalmological Society vs. Sullivan,88-1146.      TOMPKINS</TEXT><TEXT>      By a 4-4 vote, the justices upheld the murder conviction anddeath sentence of Philip Tompkins for a 1981 murder in Houston, butleft unresolved the question of how difficult it should be forprosecutors to prove they did not exclude potential jurors becauseof their race.   The court in 1986 banned prosecutors from taking race intoaccount when picking jurors, and Tompkins had contended that theprosecutor in his case had improperly rejected all 13 blackpotential jurors, leaving Tompkins, a black, with an all-white jury.   Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not participate in the decision.   The case is Tompkins vs. Texas, 87-6405.      CAPITAL PUNISHMENT</TEXT><TEXT>      The court agreed to hear the appeals of California death rowinmate Richard Boyde, who says the state's capital punishment lawdoes not give jurors enough discretion in sentencing.   Boyce _ condemned for the Jan. 15, 1981, murder of Riversideconvenience store clerk Dick Gibson _ challeneged the portion ofthe California death penalty law that requires sentencing juries toimpose death if they find that aggravating factors outweighmitigating ones.   The case is Boyde vs. California, 88-6613.      EXECUTION</TEXT><TEXT>      By a 5-4 vote, the court refused to postpone the execution ofRoderick Frey in Pennsylvania, but Frey's scheduled June 13execution had been delayed indefinitely by a lower court last week.   The top court rejected Frey's bid for a delay even though it hasagreed to review the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's deathpenalty law in an appeal that questions whether the law improperlylimits the discretion of juries in choosing life or death forconvicted killers.   Frey, 52, confessed to hiring Charles Zehring to murder Frey'swife, Barbara Jean, in 1979.   The case is Frey vs. Pennsylvania, A-914.      ANTITRUST      The court set the stage for an important antitrust ruling,agreeing to decide whether a major oil company's price-cutting planillegally harmed independent dealers.   The justices said they will review a ruling that revived alawsuit for triple damages against Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO) byindependent gas stations in California and Washington state.   The high court will hear arguments in the case in its next termbeginning in October, with a ruling likely in 1990.   The case is Atlantic Richfield vs. USA Petroleum, 88-1668.</TEXT></DOC>
