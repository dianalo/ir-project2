 Most of the Adobe Emeraldand other fast PostScript machines we had seen at Drupa appeared also in LasVegas.andP;  In addition, there were some new devices, such as the '486-based unitfrom Lennane Advanced Devices.andP;  There was also Camex's announcement ofsupport for PostScript, which we covered in our last issue.andM;One difference from Drupa was that many show visitors brought Macintoshesarmed with typical newspaper pages that they took to each vendor for speedtesting.andM;The machines we had covered in detail in our Drupa review won't be discussedagain here, but we will add relevant news since Drupa.andP;  Among the companiesshowing the same products as at Drupa were Monotype and Agfa Compugraphic.andM;Another significant issue was 600-dpi plain-paper machines.andP;  Some of them hadbeen shown at Drupa; the Xitron Clipper had not.andP;  (See the Seybold Report onDesktop Publishing, Vol.andP;  4, No.andP;  11, for a full comparative study ofplain-paper printers outputting at approximately 600 dpi.)andM;Autologic stresses speed, colorandM;So soon after Drupa, Autologic had little in the way of new products, but itdid bask in the glow of some speed tests run by newspaper personnel visitingthe booth.andP;  We weren't able to verify its claims, but Autologic said it hadwon all of the speed tests in which it had been involved.andP;  Most of the testscentered on outputting broadsheet pages with graphics.andP;  We will report ourown test results as soon as we can complete them.andM;Part of the speed comes from the Adobe Emerald RIP, which Autologic calls thePS-PIP II.andP;  Among the improvements made compared to the PS-PIP I are that theII has been integrated into one cabinet instead of two, it uses a '386instead of a '286, it sports a new page builder board interface, it runsunder Unix instead of MS-DOS, and it supports an Ethernet input option.andP;  Theresults, as we reported from Drupa, are remarkable.andM;To promote its color capabilities, Autologic contacted its users to find jobsthat had been run in color.andP;  Posted around the booth were samples producedusing tapes of Scitex images, which were stored on the Autologic GraphicsIntegrator, output as separations on a 108C (a PelBox 108 with modifiedelectronics and a power takeup cassette) and printed on a variety of paperstocks.andP;  For color work, Autologic quotes an accuracy of within a half cellon any two pages output consecutively.andM;Autologic also reported U.S.andP;  pricing of some of its color models (allspecified as recorders only, to which must be added the cost of the RIP).andO;The 70C recorder costs $25,000; the 108C, $75,000; the 108S, $60,000; the84C, $85,000; and the 84, $75,000.andM;Incidentally, the table comparing Autologic's current line of output devicesin our Drupa review (see Vol.andP;  19, No.andP;  19, p. 63) contained a typographicalerror in the resolution column.andP;  The resolution of the APS-6/70C should haveread either 723 dpi or 1,446 (not 1,146).andM;Autologic also announced a redundant AGI capability that writes each file toa second disk after it has been written to a first disk.andP;  AGIs can beconfigured in pairs starting with two units and growing to 32 (16 pairs).andM;A high-speed multiplexer was demonstrated that supports input from fourfront-end systems and output to eight recorders.andM;Other products in the booth included the AP Leaf system online to the AGI,the APS-1000 printer (the Canon LBP/20 supporting a resolution of 1,000 x 500in Autologic mode or 500 x 500 in PostScript), Sony still-video imagesrecorded on two-inch floppy disks and transferred to an Autologic system foroutput, and the Rad-Graf Yellow Pages system running on a '486 workstation,in addition to the complete Autologic family of RIPs and recorders.andM;Autologic has installed new GICL PIP software supporting objecttransformation, drawing of fonts, Ethernet input, TIFF input, CCITT Group IIIand IV data compression, and G save/G restore commands.andM;Bidco offers new recorderandM;Bidco had its newest high-resolution recording engine on hand--the 100CH, a1,446-dpi, 108-pica device that images pages at 9-1/2&quot; per minute.andP;  Howtek,Camex and Electra (see below) have OEM agreements for this new engine, whichuses essentially the same technology as the 80C typesetter introducedearlier.andM;Bidco is also offering an 80-pica version, the 80CH, at the same resolution(1,446 dpi).andM;Birmy signs with AdobeandM;Birmy Graphics showed its line of PostScript-compatible imagesetters, whichuse interpreters supplied by RIPS, and announced that it had signed anagreement to offer an Adobe RIP as an alternative to the RIPS clone.andM;The deal covers the new Adobe Emerald controller, based on the MIPS R3000RISC processor with an R3010 floating-point coprocessor.andP;  Birmy said it hopesto ship the first Emerald units later this year.andP;  Although pricing hasn'tbeen announced, Birmy said the new RIP &quot;will cause a minimal increase in theprice&quot; of the BirmySetter 300--the company's low-end imagesetter thatincorporates the Ultre recorder.andP;  The 72-pica version of the machine has beenselling for $35,000 with the Ultre engine.andM;The Emerald RIP will also drive other recorders in the Birmy family, and itwill support the Q-Station software and disk buffering that are standard withother Birmy systems.andM;In welcoming Birmy into the Adobe family, Chuck Geschke, Adobe's presidentand chief operating officer, said, &quot;We look forward to working with them onintegrating PostScript technology into their product line.&quot;andP;  ApparentlyGeschke still doesn't recognize the existence of clone RIPs in the PostScriptworld.andM;The 350Z.andP;  Birmy used ANPA as the U.S.andP;  launch of its 350Z imagesetter, whichhad made its world debut at Drupa.andP;  It combines a Birmy PostScript-compatibleRIP with a recorder designed by Holotek.andP;  The engine uses red or greenhelium-neon lasers as its light source and records at resolutions up to 4,000dpi and at speeds up to 60 inches per minute on photo materials up to 14&quot; (84picas) wide.andM;Birmy also demonstrated the Graphic Enterprises PageScan 3 recorder at 1,000x 1,000-dpi resolution (see below).andM;Screening PelBox from ECRMandM;ECRM brought a brand-new product called the Screening PelBox.andP;  Shown inprototype skins, it is essentially an Autokon camera without the scanner (oryou can look at it as a PelBox with the addition of the Autokon's screeninglogic).andM;The Screening PelBox is directed toward newspapers that want quality outputfrom picture desk systems, but that want to save a little money over the costof a full Autokon.andP;  Most of the picture desk vendors can output to a standardAutokon today.andP;  The interface to the Screening PelBox will be identical.andP;  Aswith the Autokon interface, the host system can control the screeningoptions.andP;  Alternatively, the screening options can be selected directly viacontrols on this new product--it has the same user interface as standardAutokons.andM;The end-user price will be approximately $30,000.andP;  With picture desk systemsforemost in the minds of many attenders, ANPA looked like a good place totest probe this product.andM;Electra: Bidco recorders, font groupandM;Electra, which has served primarily as a distributor for Chelgraph products,has added the Bidco line of recorders to its stable.andP;  It also announced a newfont marketing and manufacturing operation that has been spun off from themain Electra company.andM;Electra will sell the Bidco units driven by the Chelgraph Universal RIP,which supports PostScript as well as Chelgraph's Ace language.andP;  In the boothwas the Bidco FrontPage 80C recorder, one of four models Electra is offering:andM;* The 80-pica FP80C, with a claimed accuracy of [+ or -] 10 mils, for$72,405.andM;* The 80-pica FP80CH, with an accuracy of [+ or -] 3 mils, for $79,905.andM;* The 108-pica FP100CH, with an accuracy of [ or -] 10 mils, for $84,405.andM;* The 108-pica FP100CH, with an accuracy of [+ or -] 3 mils, for $91,905.andM;Plain paper.andP;  Electra is also selling four configurations of the 600-dpiChelgraph plain-paper laser printer, which it calls the Electra PPT-600.andO;Prices are (with memory and disk capacity): $24,000 (4 MB of memory and a40-MB disk); $25,000 (4 MB/80-MB); $27,500 (8 MB/40-MB); and $28,500 (8MB/80-MB).andM;All machines come with an 88000 RISC processor and 35 fonts.andP;  Deliveries arescheduled for 90 days after receipt of order.andM;IBX line.andP;  Electra is now ready to quote 60-day availability forhigh-resolution typesetters using the Chelgraph Universal RIP.andP;  The IBX 2000(2000 dpi, 15&quot;-per-minute recording speed) comes with 8 MB of memory.andP;  Thebase price of the Ace-only machine is $33,500, including a 170-MB disk.andP;  Withsupport for PostScript, the price is $52,000.andP;  Substituting a 340-MB diskadds $2,360.andM;Electra says it has installed seven machines.andM;Font operation.andP;  Electra Font Technologies was set up five months ago as aspinoff from Electra Products, although the formal company launch won't takeplace until September.andP;  Its purpose is to market and manufacture fonts thataren't being manufactured by Chelgraph.andM;The new firm has already signed deals with URW and Agfa Compugraphic foraccess to their fonts, with more to be announced later.andP;  We were told that itcurrently has 2,800 faces in PostScript (Type 1 and 3) and Cambray formats.andO;Among the Cambray format faces is an ideographic one used in conjunction withKorean language requirements.andM;Graphic Enterprises shows 1,000-dpiandM;Over the years, we have seen Graphic Enterprises' PageScan recorders in manyconfigurations, but they usually are run at resolutions below 1,000 dpi, mostfrequently at 600 dpi.andP;  At this year's ANPA show we saw a broad range ofresolutions--from 300 dpi with a Camex RIP to 1,000 dpi driven by a Birmycontroller--for the PageScan 3 unit.andM;The PageScan actually can be run at nearly any desired resolution to emulatephotographic imagesetters (e.g., at 1,016 dpi to emulate a PelBox), but onplain paper there is a definite limit to the benefits gained by increasingthe number of dots addressable by the machine.andM;We asked Graphic Enterprises if the higher resolution was accompanied by asmaller spot to produce legitimately better quality.andP;  We were told that thespot size does change, as follows:andM;* 135 microns for 300-dpi output.andM;* 90 microns for 600-dpi output (compared to 60 microns on most other 600-dpimachines).andM;* 40 microns for 1,000-dpi output.andM;Graphic Enterprises demonstrated printing on vellum paper that can be useddirectly for screen printing.andP;  Also in the booth was the AnaTech Eagle 1760gray-scale scanner (1,200 dpi, 256 gray levels, maximum input format of18&quot;x24&quot;), which is owned by Intergraph.andP;  We understand that the companies areconsidering a cooperative marketing deal but that nothing has been finalized.andM;PageScan units were present in the booths of Autografica, Birmy Graphics,Computer Peripheral Sciences, Du Pont, Graphic Enterprises of Ohio, Harris,IBM, Information International, Lennane Advanced Devices, Monotype,Mycro-Tek, Quark, Ricoh, Software Consulting Services, Synaptic ElectronicPublisher and System Integrators.andP;  Amny other vendors support it but didn'tdemonstrate it.andM;Hyphen: impressive speedsandM;Hyphen was one of the centers of attention for the PostScript speed testers.andO;Several newspapers around the country (including the Dallas Morning News, theWashington Times and the Poughkeepsie Journal) came to ANPA equipped withmegabytes of test ads, graphics and pages.andP;  Representatives from these andother newspapers traveled around the show, testing the new PostScriptimagesetters--particularly those of Autonologic, Monotype and Hyphen--andcarefully comparing their typesetting times for typical and killer newspaperpages.andM;Although we haven't had a chance to add pages like these to our standard testsuite (a project we will embark on soon), we were able to participate in someof the testing done by these newspapers.andM;We tested the Hyphen system using its high-speed hardware RIP driving aPelBox 108S.andP;  The test page was a front page of the Washinton Times, completewith a few halftones.andP;  The time to send the job from a Mac to the RIP,rasterize the page and image it on the recording unit was 2 minutes, 19seconds.andP;  There may be newspapers that insist on faster times than this, butfor most, this is fast enough for daily newspaper production.andM;The same page produced using a '486 RIP and a Panasonic 400-dpi engine (seebelow) took an impressive 48 seconds.andM;Plain paper.andP;  Hyphen had a few new wrinkles, including a repackaged PelBox3000, a 108S and new versions of its PostScript RIPS.andP;  A '486 RIP (runningHyphen PostScript software) was connected to a plain-paper Panasonic engineoutputting at 400 dpi in an 11&quot;x17&quot; format.andM;More promising, Hyphen also announced (but did not show) the ability to use a'486 and a Macintosh IIfx RIP to drive the Copal 600-dpi, plain-paperrecorder--the same engine being sold by Chelgraph in its PPT-600 and byLinotype in its LaserPrinter 60.andP;  This unit has a dual paper tray (8&quot;x11&quot; and11&quot;x17&quot;) and LocalTalk and Ethernet input into the new '486 RIP.andP;  (The samesoftware and hardware options will be offered on '386 machines for thoseopting for lower performace to save on hardware costs.)andM;Other interfaces shown at ANPA included the '486 RIP connected to a PelBoxand Mac connections to Lunotype Linotronic 300 and 500 recorders.andP;  There wasalso an IBM RS/6000 workstation on display as a RIP engine.andP;  It hasn't beeninterfaced to any recorders yet, but the rasterizing times off the newworkstation are impressive.andM;Also in the booth was Photone color editing and separation software runningon a Mac and outputting to the Hyphen RIPS.andP;  Both Sony and Nikon image inputdevides were shown for Photone's product, which Hyphen plans to sell (seeVol.andP;  19, No.andP;  13, pp.andP;  32-33 for more details).andM;OEM news.andP;  Hyphen is clearly playing the game on both sides of the street--asan OEM vendor and as a direct customer supplier.andP;  In addition to its ownbooth, Hyphen had hardware or software in 17 other booths.andM;On the OEM front, as we reported above, Hyphen has lost its contract tofurnish the RIP for Digital Technology's SpeedSetter.andP;  However, in anotherreversal, Hyphen mayu be regaining its role as a supplier of RIPs for some ofthe Hell Graphic Systems PostScript imagesetters.andM;As we reported at Drupa, Hell had switched to Harlequin as the source for theRIP for the BridgIt machine.andP;  But since then, Hell has decided that it doesnot necessarily want a single RIP supplier.andP;  It thinks customers would liketo choose, buffet style, from an assortment of products and price-performancepoints.andP;  Although Harlequin benchmarks a bit faster than Hyphen (up to 15%faster when running on the same hardware, we were told) and costs a bit less,it only runs in a Macintosh.andP;  Hyphen, in contrast, runs on Macintoshes and on'386 PCs, Sparcs and so on.andP;  This will surely increase Hell's support costs.andO;Still, some customers might have religious preferences about platforms, whichHell wants to accommodate.andP;  However, as we go to press, no deal has beensigned.andM;Lennane shows SparcandM;Jim Lennane, well known as the founder of System Integrators, is now in theRIP business with Lennane Advanced Devices.andP;  He has ported his RIP softwarefrom a '486 machine (which was on display at the show) to a Sun Sparcstation.andO;The rasterizing times on both machines appeared to be fairly fast.andP;  On the'486 unit, we rasterized one sample broadsheet page with a large halftone inabout 1 minute, 35 seconds.andP;  However, since the system wasn't set up tohandle Mac test files directly, we weren't able to test the RIP using thesame test files we ran through other PostScript RIPs at the show.andP;  We wereeager to see how the speed of the '486 compared with its new Sparc companion.andO;We will include these times in further tests.andM;The RIPs are currently interfaced to both Ultre recorders and the PelBox108S.andM;Printware adds zip to PlatesetterandM;Printware demonstrated a new RIP for its Platesetter 1440 that is expected toincrease its speed fourfold.andP;  Called the ZipRip, the version on displayhadn't been optimized, so it was impossible to verify Printware's claim.andP;  Butthe improvements in the RIP should yield significant increases.andP;  It uses a68030 processor with 8 MB of memory (expandable to 64 MB) instead of a 68020with 4 MB.andP;  The RIP is housed on one board, rather than on the series ofboards used with the earlier version.andP;  And the software has been streamlinedto increase its speed, we were told.andM;The ZipRip will run multiple RIP software on the same board, such asAutologic's ICL and PostScript.andM;The Platesetter with a ZipRip will cost $52,800, compared to $46,800 with thestandard RIP.andP;  It will include 8 MB of RAM, a 20-MB hard disk, 35 fonts, a25-MHz 68030 processor, and LocalTalk, RS232, SCSI and Centronics ports.andM;We asked if the ZipRip would be offered later for the 720 IQ plain-paperprinter and were told that parts of it would be, such as the optimized code.andO;But full implementation would involve significant changes in architecture,which would be time-consuming and costly.andP;  Printware felt the extra speed wasmore important initially for the large-format plate system outputting colorseparations than for the printer.andM;Printware discussed--but didn't show--the metal plate system announced atDrupa.andP;  One plate is expected to produce up to 50,000 impressions.andO;Availability is scheduled for the fourth quarter.andP;  The price is expected tobe in the neighborhood of $60,000-$70,000, including the ZipRip.andM;Tegra adds tint calibrationandM;Tegra built on a theme from other recent shows--caching of rasterizedgraphics for output to avoid having to rasterize them again--and added somenew touches, including a means of calibrating tint production on itsrecorders.andM;Graphics caching can accommodate images that are rasterized in the TegraSeries 5000 Image Controller, where they are stored in compressed form andmerged with text as often as needed during output.andP;  A similar facility,called Image Bypass, is available for images that are rasterized in aMacintosh or other computer and sent directly to the Series 5000 controllerfor storage and output.andP;  This facility supports images in TIFF, RIF and EPSFformats.andP;  At ANPA, Tegra announced that it will support access to thegraphics cache through Ethernet under TCP/IP protocols.andM;Another new development is support for Associated Press images coming fromthe AP Leaf Picture Desk.andP;  The Series 5000 Image Controller accepts imagesdirectly from the Picture Desk workstation and stores a compressed image filefor use as needed.andM;To maximize capabilities, the Series 5000 controller can be equipped with a440-MB hard disk, a cartidge disk drive for archiving, a PostScript-languageinterpreter, 16 MB of RAM, and any of the company's supported plain-paper andhigh-resolution recording engines.andM;ToolBox.andP;  Continuing its series of add-on capabilities for its imagesettingsystems, Tegra demonstrated an early version of a &quot;ToolBox&quot; that providesassorted aids, including a means of checking the density of output so theimagesetter can be adjusted to produce exact tint values.andM;The ToolBox incorporates some of the items in earlier Mac deskaccessories--PS Font Finder, Font Wizard, parts of PrintMaster, etc.--but itruns as an application, not a DA.andM;Perhaps the most interesting feature involves running exposure tests aimed atproducing more accurate tints.andP;  As is well known, calling for a 15% tint on aprinter or imagesetter doesn't guarantee that a 15% tint will be produced.andO;In fact, the value produced can vary by large amounts.andM;Through the new Tegra capability, the user can test the screen frequencies,angles and tint increments produced by the marking engine, then use theresults to adjust the system to produce the exact tints that are called for.andO;This test involves requesting a series of strips at various densities, whichare output and read with a densitometer.andP;  The screens actually produced bythe system are compared with the values that were requested.andP;  The system usesthe resulting information to adjust the screens it produces to yield therequested tints.andM;The ToolBox includes some other interesting new facilities.andP;  For example, itcan:andM;* Open text files, even if the application isn't found.andM;* Search for PostScript operators.andM;* Download files, either open or not.andM;* Report text statistics for a specified file--the number of characters,words, lines and sentences in the file, the longest word, the number of wordsper sentence, etc.andM;* Change the system's default screen font.andM;* Get printer and font information.andM;* Change tabs to spaces or characters to ligatures.andM;Other news.andP;  Other new developments from Tegra included the following:andM;* An online processor, called the 7260L, for use with its 5500 imagesetter(PelBox 108).andP;  It costs $23,995 in the U.S., including the transport and theprocessor, which is made by LogEtronics.andM;* The delivery of remote diagnostic software on all of its imagesettingsystems worldwide.andP;  This facility, available on the Tegra line (now calledthe Series 5000) since 1986, is now also supported on the Series 4000.andP;  AllSeries 4000 and 5000 systems contain modems as standard equipment.andP;  Incomingservice calls are routed to engineers who can dial directly into any systemat any location in the world, study the internal workings, and either solvethe problem or dispatch an engineer to the site.andP;  Series 4000 systems in thefield will be retrofitted with remote diagnostics at no charge.andM;* Support for the 5300 imagesetter in the Series 5000 line.andP;  This recorder,formerly incorporated in the Varityper 4300 and 4200 imagesetters, uses alaser-diode light source rather than the helium-neon ones that are used inthe PelBox recorders Tegra also drives.andP;  Its maximum output width is 72 picasand its recording speed is rated at 20 inches per minute at 1,200 dpi and 10inches per minute at 2,400 dpi.andM;Xitron Clipper in the fieldandM;Xitron showed its 600-dpi Clipper using a Weitek PostScript RIP and a Hitachimarking engine.andP;  This package is similar to the one Monotype is selling asthe PaperMaster, except that Xitron is using a '286 as the controller, whileMonotype's Weitek interpreter runs in a '386sx.andP;  This may mean that theClipper is somewhat slower than the PaperMaster, but if speed is a problem,Xitron may switch to a faster machine.andM;The two products also differ somewhat in configurations.andP;  The Clippersupports the Ace language and can be purchased in any of four configurations:PostScript only, Ace only, both interpreters running in the same RIP or witha separate cabinet for each RIP.andP;  Machines with Ace RIPs can also emulateCora and Compugraphic command languages--a feature Monotype plans to add.andM;Xitron announced that it has installed its first PostScript machines inRockville, Ontario, where they are being used to produce final output for adaily broadsheet newspaper composed using a Dewar system.andP;  Another unit hasbeen purchased by the daily broadsheet in Ravenna, Ohio.andM;Ace-language versions of the printer are in use at the High Plains Journal, a50-page weekly tabloid in Dodge City, Kansas, and at the Oakland Press, whichhas upgraded from a 400-dpi Panasonic printer and which also is addingPostScript support.andM;Two dual-RIP printers are being driven by an Information International TECS/2system outputting CG 8600 and PostScript code in Newcastle, Pennsylvania.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
