Congressional and administration sources said the accord, in theworks for the past month, came together after a series of meetingsThursday between Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Democratsand Republicans on both sides of the Capitol.   Bush was to announce the two-page policy agreement in a WhiteHouse appearance today with congressional leaders. Press SecretaryMarlin Fitzwater said the president met with Baker this morningbefore the congressional group to finalize the language.   ``We anticipate it will be finally approved at this meeting''with the bipartisan congressional leaders, Fitzwater said. ``Theyhave been working on this and there are some changes.''   As of Thursday night, the accord called for Congress to extendaid to the anti-Sandinista Contra rebels, now scheduled to end afterthis month, through Feb. 28, 1990. In exchange, the administrationpledges to support peace efforts of the five Central Americanpresidents and the eventual reintegration of the rebels intoNicaraguan political life.   Contra supporters say the continued presence of the 11,000fighters along the Nicaraguan border with Honduras will maintainpressure on the leftist Sandinista government to restore politicalfreedoms and hold free elections early next year.   While the agreement mentioned no specific figure for continuedaid to the rebels, money was to flow at the current rate of about $4million a month, putting the aid package at roughly $40 million.   The presidents of Honduras, El Salvador, Costa Rica, Guatemalaand Nicaragua agreed in February to renew their peace efforts andpledged to come up with a plan by mid-May to disband the Contraforce and for the rebels to be reintegrated into Nicaragua aspolitical freedoms are re-established.   All new aid to the Contras must remain consistent with thatagreement, the accord stipulates.   For the president, the agreement marked a significant step towardhis promise of a bipartisan foreign policy and was a welcomeaccomplishment in the face of growing criticism that hisadministration has been slow to get off the ground. Reviews ofpolicy on arms control, Soviet relations and the Middle East remainuncompleted.   The accord also represented an attempt to make a clean break fromthe past polarization over Nicaragua, which plagued PresidentReagan's relations with Capitol Hill throughout his two terms.   ``We are trusting the administration, and they are trusting us,''said Rep. David Obey, D-Wis. ``I do think the administration islegitimate on this.''   A key to the agreement was the insertion by Obey of a provisionthat will allow any one of four congressional committees involved inforeign affairs to cut off the rebels' aid after November if theybelieve the presence of the Contras is harming regional peaceefforts.   Another provision stipulates that aid will end automaticallyshould the Contras engage in military attacks or cross-borderincursions, or commit human rights violations. The package also saysthe aid money can be used for ``regional relocation'' of the rebels.   Baker won praise from lawmakers for his patience andforthrightness during lengthy meetings with all sides on thedivisive issue, and for his non-ideological approach. Most describedBaker as someone who came to Congress not to sell a policy, but tofind one.   ``There's no question that he wanted to find the center ofgravity and rest his policy on it,'' said Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C.,a moderate Democrat who has been part of a group of ``swing'' voterson Contra aid in the past. ``He has been trying to build a policybased on political reality.''   In Baker's early forays to the Capitol, he presented lawmakerswith a secret 10-page policy statement that included a timetable fordemocratization steps in Nicaragua, along with rewards andpunishments the United States could mete out at each juncture.   In the end, he was able to secure agreement only on a two-pagestatement of broad goals which alluded to the need for carrots andsticks to move the Sandinista government toward democracy, but whicheliminated most specifics.   Much of the two-page U.S. policy statement, which had beenstamped ``Secret'' and kept under close wraps by Baker, consisted ofbroad and general policy pronouncements reaffirming democratic goalsfor the region. Missing from the document were the kinds of harshdenunciations of the Sandinistas that characterized Reaganadministration rhetoric.   Contra spokesman Bosco Matamoros said the accord ``will be apositive element that will strengthen the possibility of achievingdemocratization in Nicaragua, and peace.''</TEXT></DOC>
