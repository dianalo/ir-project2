Education Minister Kim Young-shik proposed an exchange visit and``pilgrimage'' in which about 1,000 students from each nation wouldmarch across the other's territory to promote peace.   ``It would help restore a sense of national trust and identityamong the young generation and provide a foothold for multilateralnation exchanges,'' Kim said in a nationally broadcast speech.   South Korean officials, who spoke on condition of not beingidentified, said the North Korean government refused Thursday nightto agree to receive a letter on Friday outlining the studentexchanges. The North said the plan was pointless, they said.   President Roh Tae-woo of South Korea on July 7 unveiled a planto end the confrontation between the pro-Western South and thecommunist North by broad political, trade, cultural andhumanitarian exchanges. Roh said the plan could lead to eventualpeaceful reunification.   But North Korea rejected the Roh proposal as pointless. ``Thisis nothing new and not worth examination,'' North Korea said in aJuly 11 statement.   The two Koreas have no relations and the border is sealed. Thetwo nations technically are still at war since no peace treaty wassigned at the end of the Korean War in 1953.   Both governments say they want reunfication, but on their terms.Each side insists it is the only legitimate Korean government andmost observers doubt there will be any dramatic change in relations.   The education minister proposed the two sides hold talks by theend of July on a plan to allow about 1,000 students from eachnation to march sometime this year. Roh had said in June that hewould call for student exchange visits with the North.   North Korea has said no need exists for government involvementand student exchanges and meetings should be independent. Itsposition is designed to support radicals in the South, even thoughany North Korean student delegation would be under strict CommunistParty control.   South Korean students would march from the border across NorthKorea to Mount Paektu on the Chinese border. North Korean studentswould march across the south to Mount Halla on the southern islandof Cheju.   The march could clear the way for sports events between collegesin the North and South involving about 200 students, Kim said. Thefirst sports event would be in Pyongyang in October, followed by asecond sports meet in Seoul next April, he said.   If the first exchanges are a success, Kim said they could beexpanded to cultural and artistic exchanges and tours by studentsfrom both nations.   The Roh government issued the call for improved relations afterSouth Korean radical students demanded immediate reunification. Thegovernment used riot police to stop thousands of students marchingto the border June 10 for talks with North Korean student delegates.   Roh's administration was caught offguard on the issue as peopledebated reunification. It has since attempted to catch up on theissue.   But Roh's proposals were similar or identical to past iniativesby both governments since 1971 on improving relations. All failedto produce results. The two Koreas arranged small-scale familyreunification visits and cultural exchanges in 1985.   North Korea, which has staged a number of attacks on the Southover the years, is demanding to act as co-host at the Olympic Gamesin Seoul this September. Olympic authorities rejected the demandand the North said it will boycott the games.   The Korean peninsula was divided in 1945 by U.S. and Sovietforces that ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World WarII. The North invaded the South in 1950 and set off the three-yearKorean War. The United States and other nations fought for theSouth under the United Nations flag, opposed later in the conflictby Chinese forces.</TEXT></DOC>
