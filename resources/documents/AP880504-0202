That's Woody Allen, Francis Ford Coppola and Martin Scorsese.The three directors are making a film for Disney's TouchstonePictures on life in modern-day Manhattan.   Production work has started on the trilogy, and since theproject was spearheaded by Allen, it carries its usual Allenesquecloak of secrecy.   All a Disney spokesman would say was that Allen will write,direct and star in his segment but that no other casting has beenconfirmed. Coppola is writing his segment with his daughter, Sofia.Richard Price (``The Color of Money'') is writing Scorsese's part.   All three filmmakers have used New York as their celluloidplaygrounds. Coppola shot ``The Godfather'' and ``The Cotton Club''here. Scorsese did ``Raging Bull,'' ``Mean Streets,'' ``TaxiDriver'' and ``King of Comedy'' on the sidewalks of New York.   And just about all of Allen's work is Manhattan-bound.   Disney would not discuss the project's budget, and said themovie, tentatively titled ``New York Stories,'' will be released inearly next year.</TEXT></DOC>
