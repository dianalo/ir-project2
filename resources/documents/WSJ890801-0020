The Merc action, which hasn't been announced, is likely to bring a highly negative response from federal prosecutors, who earlier this year warned the exchange that its internal investigation could interfere with the government's 2 1/2-year inquiry of alleged trading abuses at the Merc and the Chicago Board of Trade. The first wave of federal indictments is expected as soon as tomorrow.    It couldn't immediately be learned if the Merc intends to build a large number of cases based on trades under federal scrutiny.    A Merc spokesman last night said the exchange wouldn't comment on a pending disciplinary case. As for the exchange's motives in bringing such cases, he said: &quot;We are obligated under our rules and the Commodity Exchange Act to investigate any wrongdoing brought to our attention.&quot;    U.S. Attorney Anton R. Valukas wouldn't comment.    The charges of prearranged trading were decided on July 18 by a special committee of the Merc's board, and could result in fines and expulsion of the traders, according to a person familiar with the internal charges.    The action also raises what defense lawyers say are serious constitutional problems, because the Merc in this case and others is charging traders with failure to cooperate with the exchange's inquiry, though traders could risk self-incrimination in the federal probe should they cooperate.    The Merc sought in its internal investigation to interview the FBI mole, who traded in the yen pit, but the U.S. attorney's office refused to make him available.    The Merc members and former members charged have all been contacted by the federal investigators, according to people familiar with the inquiry. The four charged are:    --Brian E. Sledz, who sold his Merc seat for $350,000 last Jan. 19, two days after the federal probe was disclosed. He was charged with three counts of prearranged trading. Mr. Sledz netted more than $1 million at the Merc last year.    --James G. Sledz, the younger brother of Brian, who left the exchange the same day. He was charged with two counts of prearranged trading. He netted close to $200,000 at the Merc last year.    --Sam Cali, formerly a member of a powerful broker group that has ties to a top Merc official. He was charged with a single count of prearranged trading and with failing to cooperate with the Merc's investigation.    --Thomas A. Crouch, one of the few exchange members to comment publicly on the federal probe, in a February Chicago Tribune article. He was charged with a single prearranged trade and failure to cooperate.    The Merc began an investigation into trading in the yen pit and the Swiss franc futures pit after the federal inquiry was disclosed. The trades in question occurred in December in yen-futures contracts expiring both that month and in March.    Thomas A. Durkin, a lawyer for Mr. Cali, confirmed last night that his client had been charged by the Merc and said the Merc charges are an attempt to appear tough in the face of the federal investigation -- &quot;an incredible case of {hide} covering.&quot; Mr. Durkin asserted his client is being made a &quot;scapegoat&quot; for the Merc's own failings.    &quot;If this is really such a scandal, where was the Merc compliance department?&quot; Mr. Durkin said. &quot;Where has everybody been?&quot; He added of Mr. Cali, &quot;I think he is innocent of any criminal wrongdoing.&quot;    Mr. Cali is expected to be indicted in the federal investigation and charged with mail and wire fraud and violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations law, according to a person familiar with the inquiry. Entire trading pits are expected to be named racketeering enterprises.    Mr. Cali was until earlier this year a broker with ABS Partners, the Merc's most influential broker group, which has close ties to John F. Sandner, a former Merc chairman and currently a top policy adviser and director.    James McGurk, a lawyer for Brian Sledz, declined to comment on the Merc disciplinary action. By letter, he told the exchange in June that because Brian Sledz is no longer a member, he isn't required to appear for questioning. The Merc disagreed.    Mr. McGurk said he is fighting in Illinois state court for Mr. Sledz's $350,000 proceeds from the sale of his seat in January. He said the Merc argued that it held the money because of pending disciplinary proceedings. But the lawyer contended there were no charges when the seat was sold, or for months after that. He said the Merc argued that the proceedings begin with an inquiry, and not formal charges.    Mr. Cali and Brian Sledz are friends, and traders say both occasionally went to breakfast with the FBI mole, who went by the name Peter Vogel. Mr. Cali also played basketball with the FBI man, whom defense attorneys have since identified as Dieter Volk. Mr. Crouch and Brian Sledz stood close to each other in the yen pit, and Mr. Crouch sometimes filled trading orders for Mr. Sledz.    Mr. Crouch was quoted in a Feb. 5 Tribune article as saying &quot;Vogel&quot; claimed to have big trading losses and would enter into tax-scam trades with successful traders. Other traders have said &quot;Vogel&quot; offered to take winning trades and kick back most of the winnings in cash to the opposite trader, helping the trader to convert some of his profits into tax-free income. The practice is illegal, both under commodities law and tax law.    Mr. Crouch wouldn't comment on the internal charges. Brian Sledz, through his lawyer, wouldn't comment. James Sledz couldn't be reached.    Prosecutors are concerned that exchange investigations of trades the government is scrutinizing could hamper the federal inquiry. Exchange cases could create evidence that might contradict federal evidence, or otherwise confuse a jury. And exchange cases could also benefit potential federal targets by allowing them early on to examine evidence on the trades.    Lawyers representing traders, exchange clearing firms and others have freely exchanged information about government subpoenas they receive, and also supply each other with copies of records handed over to prosecutors. </TEXT></DOC>
