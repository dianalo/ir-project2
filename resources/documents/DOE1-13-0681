The study also estimates the allowable fuel-cellcost for a variety of industrial cogenerative and competitive technologyapplications and the sensitivity of allowable fuel-cell cost to fuelprice variations, process/application parameters, and economic factors.Results indicate that advanced fuel cells may be economically competitivein the industrial cogeneration markets in the 1990s.</TEXT></DOC>
