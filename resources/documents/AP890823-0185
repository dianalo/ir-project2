Sajak has not only failed to lure viewers away from Carson, hefaces his own serious challenge from Arsenio Hall. Although ``TheArsenio Hall Show'' is syndicated and does not compete directlyagainst Sajak, his ratings have been running behind those for Hall.Another problem is that Hall's show is a favorite of the youngaudience most prized by advertisers.   Sajak is also behind ABC's ``Nightline'' and NBC's ``Late NightWith David Letterman.'' In addition, it's slightly behind theratings CBS had last year for a mixture of late-night shows.   Reportedly, CBS executives said they would kill the show if theratings didn't improve by the end of the year. Some people arestarting to write Sajak's obituary. But according to sources at CBS,as in the case of Mark Twain's reported death, the reports may begreatly exaggerated.   ``As far as I know, there's no ticking clock,'' said Sajak. ``Ihonestly don't know what their expectations are. My department isdoing the show, not worrying about the ratings.   ``I have no control on the ratings. I do have control over seeingthat the show is good and I think in time that will affect theratings. We had no illusions about going in and knocking anybody offand becoming an overnight sensation. It doesn't work that way inlate night. We said from the beginning we'd get an early splash outof curiosity, then people would settle into their old viewing habitsand in the long haul we would bring them back.''   An important point, perhaps the crucial point, is that the Sajakshow is making a profit for CBS.   ``The fact that Sajak is running behind NBC and ABC and evenbehind what CBS had last year certainly generates a discussion ofhow long we'll hang in,'' said David Poltrack, CBS senior vicepresident for planning and research. ``On the other hand, the showis highly marketable. Even with the low ratings the advertisingrates are higher and the spots are selling well.''   Poltrack said an increase in the audience would make the Sajakshow ``a major moneymaker.''   ``It is a show that has already improved our revenue picture,''he said, ``and has the potential of improving our profitabilitydramatically if it can develop a larger audience. That suggestspatience and an investment of time and energy to get it right.''   Part of the show's profitability undoubtedly is due to the factthat a talk show is cheaper to produce than the action-adventureshows it replaced.   Rod Perth, CBS' newly appointed vice president for late-nightprogramming, said he has not received any ultimatums.   ``I would not have taken this job to get involved in a projectthat the network did not have confidence in,'' said Perth. ``Nobodygave me any mandate. The way this business works is I think ifpeople are competitive they want to make things work and work well.That's my personal mandate.''   Perth said he was too new to the job to say what changes he willmake in the Sajak show to improve its ratings.   ``All of these shows evolve,'' he said. ``Of course, there arethings being discussed. We feel this show has the potential, andanything that's a living, breathing, five-day-a-week entity has toevolve. We have every confidence in Pat Sajak.''   The Sajak show has been undergoing some changes in an effort toattract more viewers.   ``We've been fiddling with the show from the beginning,'' saidSajak. ``But we're not going to imitate Oprah Winfrey and wanderinto the audience looking for lesbian nuns. We've played around withvarious elements, but I think the show is basically the same as itwas when we went on the air. I signed up for anentertainment-oriented talk show and that's what I'm doing.''   Perth, who said as a broadcaster he would not be happy until hewas No. 1, added, ``I would ask people to remember this show enteredthe most competitive time period in television against the mostentrenched competition in television. You have to put expectationsat a reasonable level.''</TEXT><TEXT>      Elsewhere in television:   EMMY FIRST _ The Academy of Television Arts andamp; Sciences has addeda new Emmy category for casting for a miniseries or special.
