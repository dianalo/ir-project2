A U.S. appeals court is expected to resolve the twocompanies' patent dispute. Merrill Lynch analyst StuartWeisbrod said a court decsion could come within two months.   Amgen fell 1/2 to 59 3/4, although several analystsrepeated their &quot;buy&quot; opinions on the biotechnology leaderafter the FDA action. Mr. Weisbrod reduced his earningsestimates for Amgen's year ending in March, but he continuesto advise clients to buy shares of the Thousand Oaks, Calif.,company. Mr. Weisbrod said Amgen will receive a payment fromHoffmann-La Roche later than he expected. He also cited taxand marketing expenses in reducing his earnings forecast.
