The French played for time, adding a few insignificant hours totheir mobilization, before declaring war.   There were those who thought the Poles could hold out for acouple of months. Even the Germans thought in terms of weeks. ButGerman power had not been tested yet. It became a war of horse-drawnartillery against motorized guns that could cover bad roads at 40miles an hour, a war of lances against tanks.   The Polish Air Force was destroyed in 48 hours by German bombers.Stukas punctuated the sky, dive-bombing Polish troops who quicklylearned to lay low until the planes came out of their dives and fireat them as they struggled for altitude.   Cracow, Poland's second city, fell on Sept. 6. That same nightthe Polish government fled the capital. Within one week Poland's 35divisions had been either surrounded or destroyed by the fast-movingGermans. It was all over in 17 days.   The Germans tried to hurry the Soviets into the fray and to moveto pre-arranged borders as their part of the spoils _ and to takesome of the international blame. Wily Stalin, however, wanted theGermans to agree to a statement that the Soviets had entered Polandto spare White Russians from Nazi rule. The flabbergasted Germanswould not agree.   So Stalin re-drew the occupation zones, giving up a small sliceof Poland for control of all the Balkan countries.   Stalin got more than the German wanted to give him: Ukranianwheat and Romanian oil and a buffer of countries against likelyGerman perfidy. Never mind that Hitler would take it all back inJune 1941, after he had conquered Europe. But for now it was asecure border.   The expected clash of the giants in the West didn't happen. TheFrench army, brought to the front by a divided government, satbehind the Maginot Line, unwilling to force the issue.   The first British troops could not be expected on the continentuntil October. Besides, the conquest of Poland had been ademonstration of incredible military force. Even Hitler was gratefulfor the respite. Any incursion, any air raid, would require hispersonal approval. The poised angels of destruction bided their timebehind the Siegfried Line.   The stagnant war was called the sitzkrieg. The majorconfrontation would be in abeyance until Hitler was good and ready,in the spring of 1940.   The German Navy, however, was given carte blanche. With the waragainst Britain only 10 hours old, the British liner Athenia with1,400 passengers was torpedoed without warning and sunk some 200miles west of Scotland's Hebrides Islands. Of the 112 lost, 28 wereAmericans.   The Germans denied that their submarines had attacked (it waslater proved they had). They accused Churchill of putting a timebomb aboard to influence British and international public opinion.Nevertheless, in the first week of the war, the Germans sent 11British ships to the bottom. For all of September U-boats claimed 26ships sunk, and German mines took three more.   Meanwhile, in the United States, Roosevelt sought to move hisnation out of its isolationist stance. He was, he said, ``almostliterally walking on eggs,'' so politically sensitive was the issue.   At stake was the Neutrality Act. Finally, on Oct. 27, by a 63-30vote, the Senate repealed the act with the House following. Armswere now for sale on a cash-and-carry basis, and the first Britishfreighters began loading a week later.   While all of this was going on, a curious and ominous letterpassed the president's desk, drafted by Leo Szilard, one of the manydisplaced scientists who fled Hitler, and signed by another, AlbertEinstein. It told of advancements in atomic research, of potentialexplosive devices of incredible power, each capable of destroying awhole city.   Roosevelt was slow to understand the cautious scientificcommunication, but when an adviser pointed out that Napoleon oncehad turned down Fulton's steamboat that might have carried histroops to Britain, the president got the point.   Roosevelt and Hitler were ironic characters of Shakespeareanproportions. Both rose to power a day apart in the depths of theDepression. The world was out of work and out of hope. WhileBerliners carted their nearly worthless Deutsche marks to market bywheelbarrow, a third of America was unemployed, 400,000 rode therails. New York City had a million jobless, 82 breadlines and some7,000 men and boys on the streets, shining shoes for pennies.   Both leaders pulled their nations up out of despair by theirbootstraps, Hitler by edict, Roosevelt by innovative socialprograms. They then led their peoples through a cataclysm such asthe world had never seen. And they would die within 18 days of eachother in April 1945.   The failed German artist, who had lived in Viennese flophousesand survived on charity soup, shot himself next to his poisonedmistress-bride in a beseiged bunker. The patrician American withwithered legs was struck down by a massive stroke while waiting tosit for his portrait, looking forward to the internationalconference that would charter the United Nations.   Within their political lifetimes, some 50 million people vanishedfrom the face of the earth in the violence of war, 20 million ofthem in the Soviet Union alone. Of the 70 million men and women whofought in the various armies, 17 million were killed.   And the atomic bomb was born.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, Aug. 27</NOTE></DOC>
