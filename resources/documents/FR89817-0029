This action is necessary since NP loansare not eligible for program supervision and servicing and NP debtors arenot eligible for program benefits and entitlements. They cannot, therefore,be made, managed, collected, and liquidated in the same manner as programloans. In the past, there have been a relatively small number of NP loans,which are on more stringent terms than program loans and an extension ofcredit for the convenience of the Government. The intended effect is tohave a regulation for the uniform handling of NP loans.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>DATES:</T2> Comments must be submitted on or before October 16, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>ADDRESSES:</T2> Submit written comments in duplicate to the Chief,Directives and Forms Management Branch, Farmers Home Administration, U.S.Department of Agriculture, Room 6348, South Agriculture Building, 14thStreet and Independence Avenue, SW., Washington, DC 20250.

Nonprogram(NP) loans are an extension of credit for the convenience of the Governmentto facilitate loan servicing actions or assist with the sale of acquiredproperty. Program credit is not provided because the property either doesnot meet current program requirements and/or the applicant does not meetcurrent loan program eligibility requirements. An NP loan is made on morestringent terms than a program loan. Previously, guidance on handling NPloans was dispersed through various regulations including subparts A andC of part 1965 and subpart C of part 1955. The new regulation will combinethose portions of these regulations of NP loans into one regulation andprovide for guidance that was not previously and/or explicitly providedin existing regulations. This will make it easier for FmHA personnel andthe general public to ascertain our regulations on NP loans. The major issues in subpart J of part 1951 which are clarified, established,or vary from that contained in existing FmHA regulations are as follows:1. Reiterates and clarifies that NP loans are eligible for program supervisionor management, and NP debtors are not entitled to program benefits andentitlements such as interest credit, moratorium, reamortization, rescheduling,consolidation, deferral, limited resource assistance or appeal rights.2. Establishes a nonrefundable application fee, which will change periodically,to process an application for NP credit. The application fee is exclusiveof any required credit report fee. Proposes to intially set the fee at$100. 3. Reduces downpayment requirements on NP credit sales of farm real estate.Currently, a 10% downpayment is required on NP credit sales, while thedownpayment for a NP transfer and assumption is only 5%. The downpaymentrequirements, regardless of whether the property is sold from FmHA inventoryor by a debtor through transfer and assumption, will be 5% for consistency.4. Establishes a collection policy consistent with conventional lenderson the servicing and collection of overdue payments. Program servicingregulations and authorities are not authorized. 5. Establishes policy concerning accepting a voluntary conveyance of NPproperty only when voluntary liquidation cannot be accomplished and itis in the Government's best interests. The State Director is the only FmHAfield official authorized to accept a voluntary conveyance from a NP borrower.6. Clarifies that acceleration letters to NP borrowers will not containappeal rights, but will provide rights to have the decision reviewed bythe next level supervisor to determine if the loan is not in default. 7. Provides detailed guidance on debt settlement of NP debts. 8. Provides that NP debtors will not be released from liability unlessthe NP debt is satisfied in full. The major revisions in other regulations which are incorporated in thisrulemaking are as follows: 1. Section 1951.314(a)(9) is added to allow the remaining balance of theaccount to be reamortized when the total FmHA debt is not assumed. 2. Section 1951.612(a)(1)(iii) is revised to remove the authority to enterinto an accelerated repayment agreement. 3. Section 1965.26(f) is revised to provide the authority to voucher forauthorized selling expenses for which there are insufficient equity proceedsfor payment at closing. 4. Section 1965.125(a)(3) is revised to remove authority to permit acceleratedrepayment agreements. 5. Section 1965.126(b)(3) is revised to provide that the remaining debtof the transferor's account will be reamortized in accordance with SubpartG of Part 1951 of this chapter. <ITAG tagnum="84">Programs Affected </ITAG>These programs/activities are listed in the Catalog of Federal DomesticAssistance (CFDA) under Nos:<ITAG tagnum="26">10.404 Emergency Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.405 Farm Labor Housing Loans and Grants </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.406 Farm Operating Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.407 Farm Ownership Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.410 Low Income Housing Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.411 Rural Housing Site Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.414 Resource Conservation and Development Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.415 Rural Rental Housing and Water Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.416 Soil and Water Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.417 Very Low-Income Housing Repair Loans and Grants </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.418 Water and Waste Disposal Systems for Rural Communities </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.419 Watershed Protection and Flood Prevention Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.421 Indian Tribes and Tribal Corporation Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.422 Business and Industrial Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.423 Community Facilities Loans </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="26">10.427 Rural Rental Assistance Payments </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="84">Intergovernmental Consultation </ITAG>For the reasons set forth in the Final Rule related Notice(s) to 7 CFRpart 3015, subpart V, the following programs are excluded from the scopeof Executive Order 12372 which requires Intergovernmental consultationwith State and local officials: 10.404_Emergency Loans, 10.406_Farm OperatingLoans, 10.407_Farm Ownership Loans, 10.410_Low Income Housing Loans, 10.416_Soiland Water Loans, and 10.417_Very Low Income Housing Repair Loans and Grants.The following programs are subject to intergovernmental consultation withState and local officials: 10.405_Farm Labor Housing Loans and Grants,10.411_Rural Housing Site Loans, 10.414_Resource Conservation and DevelopmentLoans, 10.415_Rural Rental Housing Loans, 10.418_Water and Waste DisposalSystems for Rural Communities, 10.419_Watershed Protection and Flood PreventionLoans, 10.421_Indian Tribes and Tribal Corporation Loans, 10.422_Businessand Industrial Loans, 10.423_Community Facility Loans, and 10.427_RuralRental Assistance Payments. <ITAG tagnum="84">Regulatory Flexibility Act </ITAG>This proposed rule has been reviewed with regard to the requirements ofthe Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601-612).

The sale of Candamp;BP and MFHinventory property to NP purchasers will be handled in accordance withsubpart C of part 1955 of this chapter. Borrowers who have program andNP loans will have their loan accounts serviced and liquidated in accordancewith the applicable program regulations. However, even though the NP loanwill not be eligible for program servicing benefits or entitlements, theborrower is not precluded from receiving assistance on the program loan(e.g., having an NP farm loan should not preclude a borrower from beingconsidered for debt restructuring assistance in the form of a deferral,rescheduling , consolidation, etc., on a FP program loan). An NP loan isa loan on terms more stringent that terms for a program loan and it isan extension of credit for the convenience of the Government because theapplicant does not qualify for program assistance or the property to befinanced is not suited for program purposes. Such loans are made or continuedonly when it is in the best interest of the Government. NP loans include:(a) Sale of inventory property on nonprogram terms; (b) Assumption of a program loan on nonprogram terms; (c) Loan converted to NP status as a result of receipt of unauthorizedassistance; (d) Sale of the real property of a Farmer Program (FP) borrower under theleaseback/buyback program on nonprogram terms;(e) Sale of the real property of a Farmer Program (FP) borrower under theHomestead Protection program; or (f) FP accounts rescheduled under an accelerated repayment agreement. <ITAG tagnum="80">andSection; 1951.452</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="89">Policy.</ITAG>Nonprogram credit is extended for the convenience of the Government inservicing an existing loan or to facilitate sale of inventory property.Where a borrower has both program and NP loans outstanding, servicing willbe according to the regulation applicable to the program loan(s).
