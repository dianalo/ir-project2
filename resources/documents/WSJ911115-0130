They distributed gas in Pragueand Siena. They installed electric lighting in China.   By the end of World War II, revolutions andnationalizations had ended most of those foreign adventures,and Tractebel shrank back to Belgium. Now the company istrying to go global again.</LP><TEXT>   &quot;Roots]&quot; chortles Philippe Bodson, Tractebel's ebullientchief executive officer. &quot;That's what we could call ourstrategy]&quot; Emboldened by a world-wide trend to allow moreprivate investment in what were once public-sector domains,Tractebel is investing in power plants and other projects asfar afield as Poland, Thailand and Portugal. It also istesting the waters in the U.S. electric-power industry.   Aside from diversifying, Tractebel is trying to find arole for itself. With a stock market value equivalent toabout $3 billion, this holding company is owned 40% byanother holding company, Societe Generale de Belgique S.A.,which is controlled by a third holding company, Cie. de Suezof France.   For its part, Tractebel holds 39% of Belgium'selectric-power company, Electrabel S.A., along with interestsin natural gas distribution, cable television, engineeringservices and real estate.   Such a complicated holding company structure can providefiscal advantages and protection from raiders. But why doesTractebel need its opulent headquarters in central Brusselsand a highflying manager like Mr. Bodson?   The Belgian executive, recruited by the company two yearsago, replies that Tractebel's &quot;vocation&quot; is to become more ofan industrial operator than a passive investor. A formerMcKinsey andamp; Co. consultant with experience in the banking andglass-making industries, Mr. Bodson also says his job is toprepare Tractebel for a brave new world in which electricutilities may poach more and more on one another'sterritories.   In any case, the 47-year-old Mr. Bodson is hardly the typeto settle for a bit part. His manic charisma and wisecrackingstyle sometimes make him seem as much of an entertainer as anexecutive, in jarring contrast to the softspoken engineersaround him. For a recent interview, Mr. Bodson swept in withfour senior officers in tow, but did nearly all the talkinghimself, cutting off colleagues in mid-sentence when theystrayed into technicalities.   For all his star quality, however, Mr. Bodson hasn'tpersuaded everybody that Tractebel is turning into anexciting growth stock. &quot;For me,&quot; says Vincent Camerlynck, abroker at James Capel andamp; Co. in London, &quot;it's still very mucha holding company.&quot; Interests in Belgian electricity and gasutilities accounted for about four-fifths of profit lastyear. But Tractebel is making small steps to broaden itself.   Along with Electricite de France and other partners,Tractebel is investing in a new power-generation companyserving eastern Germany. It is studying possible power-plantconstruction projects in Hungary and Poland. In a jointventure with Scottish Power PLC, Tractebel has bid to acquirea power plant in Portugal. In partnership with AES Corp. ofthe U.S., the Belgian company is bidding to operate two powerplants in Northern Ireland.   Meanwhile, it plans to invest in a Thai power plant, andis looking at potential projects in Indonesia and other Asiancountries.   Closer to home, Tractebel is bracing itself for what couldbe traumatic changes in the way European Community electricalutilities are regulated. Although the EC Commission recentlydelayed action on its plans to introduce more competition inthe electricity market, it seems clear that obstacles toselling electricity across borders will be reduced sooner orlater.   Mr. Bodson says Tractebel is in talks with several otherEuropean utilities about the possibility of acquiringminority stakes in one another as a prelude to &quot;intensecollaboration.&quot; Such links might offer protection againstcutthroat competition.   In July, Tractebel bought interests in three small powerplants in Vermont and New Hampshire. That presence gives thecompany a chance to learn about a looser regulatory system,experience that could prove handy once EC regulations change.   So far, the foreign investments are relatively small. Mr.Bodson will say only that Tractebel is prepared to investbillions of Belgian francs (one billion francs is equivalentto about $30 million) annually over the next few years insuch projects. But the ambitions are fairly big: Tractebeleventually wants to operate as much electricity capacityabroad as it does in Belgium.   Mr. Bodson says Tractebel will finance the investmentsfrom internal resources. Already, he has warned shareholdersthat the company's payout ratio, or the proportion ofearnings used for dividends, is likely to decline asTractebel plows more money into expansion.   Like other companies, Tractebel also is trying to becomegreener. It long has been involved in collecting and treatinghousehold waste in Belgium and several other Europeancountries. Last year it acquired Brackett Green, a smallBritish concern involved in water treatment. Tractebel'sgreen ambitions suffered a setback earlier this year,however, when it lost a bid to become the private-sectorpartner in a Flemish water-treatment venture. The winner wasSevern Trent PLC of Britain.   More worrisome, Tractebel sometimes has seemed fickle inits strategy. A few years ago, it began investing in mediacompanies on the theory that they were closely related toTractebel's interests in cable-TV distribution networks.Among other purchases, Tractebel bought 20% of Act IIICommunications Inc., a diversified U.S. maker of TV programscontrolled by Norman Lear. Now those media investments, whichproduced a loss for Tractebel last year, are on the block.   &quot;The strategic options are changed rather easily,&quot;comments Ruth Devenyns, an analyst at Kredietbank NV. &quot;Whoknows what it will be next year?&quot;   There are other apparent inconsistencies in Tractebel'sstrategy. Although Mr. Bodson wants to be seen as anindustrial operator, the company is sitting on an 11.7% stakein Petrofina SA, a big Brussels-based oil and petrochemicalcompany.   More controversial was Tractebel's decision earlier thisyear to buy a stake in Fibelpar, a financial holding company,for 2.7 billion francs from Generale de Belgique, Tractebel'sbiggest shareholder. Mr. Bodson concedes that Fibelpardoesn't fit Tractebel's strategy but says the transactionbolstered Generale de Belgique's finances. Having a strongprincipal shareholder makes Tractebel more stable and lessvulnerable to raiders, he argues.   What about investors who suspect that Tractebel is puttingGenerale de Belgique's interests ahead of those of smallershareholders?   &quot;They can sell their shares,&quot; Mr. Bodson snaps. After apause, he adds: &quot;But I think they would be making a mistake.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
