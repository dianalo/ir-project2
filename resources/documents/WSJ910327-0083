Earlier studies have shown improvement in mental functionsof AIDS patients treated with Peptide T. Scientists hope thenew trials will show whether the drug can reduce problems ofconcentration and memory caused by the AIDS virus.Researchers also want to know if the drug is safe andeffective if it's used in conjunction with AZT, the only drugapproved in the U.S. for treating acquired immune deficiencysyndrome.</LP><TEXT>   Peptide T, which was developed by scientists at the mentalhealth institute, is an artificially produced protein thatkeeps the AIDS virus from attaching to human cells.   The institute is conducting the study in conjunction withthe National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease andthe University of Southern California. Investigators say theyare also making special efforts to include women andminorities in the study, groups that have beenunderrepresented in previous AIDS studies.</TEXT></DOC>
