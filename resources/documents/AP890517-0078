President Mengistu Haile Mariam cut short a state visit to EastBerlin and was on his way home this afternoon, the East Germanstate news agency reported as the second day of the revolt drew toa close.   Two dissident generals were killed Tuesday in the rebellion,which began after Mengistu left Addis Ababa for East Berlin,Ethiopian state radio said. The Ethiopian leader of 15 years wasscheduled to return home Thursday.   There were unconfirmed reports that the defense minister, Maj.Gen. Haile Giorgis Habte Mariam, was slain by dissident officersearly in the revolt, but the radio made no mention of his death.   ``In Addis itself, it's increasingly looking like a failed coup,but it appears to be a very different story in other parts of thecountry and especially in the north,'' said a Western diplomat inthe capital. ``It's a very fluid situation.''   Government broadcasts from Addis Ababa's closed BoleInternational Airport warned commercial and private pilots not tofly over northern Asmara city, capital of the Eritrean Provincethat has been in revolt against the government for 28 years.   Asmara is the headquarters of Ethiopia's 2nd Army, consisting of150,000 soldiers. Diplomats believed many of them were siding withcoup leaders. Ethiopia has Africa's largest and most well-armedarmy. But many of its quarter of a million soldiers are unwillingconscripts.   ``We're just not sure what's going on in Asmara, whether thearmy has handed its arms to the EPLF (the rebel Eritrean People'sLiberation Front) or whether it remains a viable, unified force inopposition to the government,'' the diplomat said on condition ofanonymity.   Even as Addis Ababa Radio was saying the revolt had beencrushed, another radio station was claiming victory for dissidentsoldiers.   The second station, broadcasting on a frequency normally used bythe government radio station in Asmara, said the government hadbeen overthrown and called on the armed forces to unite behind thecoup leaders.   The second day of the revolt dawned with a pitched tank andartillery battle at an old, abandoned airport on the outskirts ofAddis Ababa which houses a number of military compounds.   ``It was thunderous,'' said the diplomat. ``You could feelbuildings shaking here in the city.   ``After that, things calmed down for a while, but then therewere several fairly severe firefights around town. What we thinkwas happening is that loyal troops were flushing out insurgents whowere in hiding.''   By midafternoon the city appeared calm again, said the diplomat.``But the situation is obviously quite tense and the army iseverywhere around the city.''   All offices, shops and schools in the capital were closed. Stateradio urged citizens to remain in their homes. Key governmentoffices were heavily guarded.   An African military attache based in Addis Ababa said the armygarrison in Harar, in eastern Ethiopia, also was supporting thecoup attempt and that negotiations were under way in the capitalbetween loyalist and dissident military leaders.   ``Things are bad,'' the attache said. ``It is just that they(the government) are not saying.''   Addis Ababa Radio made no mention of the new fighting around thecapital this morning. Throughout the day, it repeated a communiquefrom Ethiopia's State Council reporting the deaths of two coupleaders.   Maj. Gen. Merid Negusie, the chief of staff, and Maj. Gen. AmhaDesta, commander of the air force, were killed by loyalist troopsin the early hours of the revolt, it said.   There have been persistent reports of military unrest inEthiopia, especially among field commanders who reportedly feel thegovernment has not supported them adequately in the northern civilwar.   ``Some conspiring generals wanted to create great unrest anddisturbance, to shed the blood of innocent people and generallydestabilize the unity of our motherland, even though theirtreacherous aims did not succeed,'' Addis Ababa Radio said.   ``They tried to use force but were killed,'' the broadcast said.``Most of the conspiring generals have been forced to surrender.''It gave no further details.   The military deposed Emperor Haile Selassie in a coup on Sept.12, 1974, and a provisional military government was established.After fighting between factions in the armed forces, Mengistu, thenan army major, came to power and set up a government that is theSoviet Union's strongest ally in Africa.   Mengistu inherited the northern rebellions. Recently, his forceshave been all but forced out of Eritrea and Tigre in a series ofhumiliating defeats at the hands of the separatist EritreanPeople's Liberation Front and the Tigrean People's LiberationFront, which wants more autonomy.</TEXT></DOC>
