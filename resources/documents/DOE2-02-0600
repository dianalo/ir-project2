While the problem of pulsation induced erroris more commonly associated with the orifice meter, it is not a problemrestricted solely to this type of primary measurement device. The turbinemeter, vortex shedding meter, and diaphragm meter are all subject toerrors induced by pulsating flow. The tremendous value now placed onthe gas passing through these purchase and sales meters has made accuratemeasurement imperative. It is becoming increasingly more important tounderstand, predict, measure, and control pulsations if the measurementis to have any validity.</TEXT></DOC>
