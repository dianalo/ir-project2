The COMPASS Data System will be an extension ofthe data collecting techniques already in use. Data acquisition willuse Camac systems controlled by LSI-11 computers operating under RT-11.The data will be transferred via an Ethernet LAN to a VAX data managementcomputer. Data storage and archive will use optical discs providing on-linestorage for 11/2 to 3 Gbytes and a retrieval time of 1 to 2 minutes foroff-line data. Set-up and performance parameters from the programmablecontroller operated Machine Control System will be stored as part ofthe raw data. Control of the output power of the ECRH system will beshared between the Machine Control System and the Data System.</TEXT></DOC>
