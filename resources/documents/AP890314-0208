More than 110,000 assault-type weapons with pending applicationsfor import will be affected, according to the announcement by thenew national drug control director, William J. Bennett.   The action does not affect weapons already in this country, butblocks import of certain guns unless it can be determined they arefor sporting use, officials said.   It also does not affect weapons made in the United States, suchas the AR15, the semiautomatic, civilian version of the .223-caliberM-16.   The administration's decision comes amid a rising chorus of callsfor controlling semiautomatic weapons, which many police officialssay are the weapon of choice for drug pushers. The weapons have beenincreasingly used in drug-related shootings, particularly in urbanareas.   The push for controls on semiautomatics was also given impetus bythe Jan. 17 slaying of five school children in Stockton, Calif., byPatrick Edward Purdy, who then killed himself. Purdy also injured 29other children and and one teacher.   Among the weapons Purdy used as a Chinese-made AK-47semiautomatic, which he had purchased at an Oregon gun store.   Before Tuesday, Bush had not indicated any willingness to moveagainst the proliferation of semiautomatic weapons except to say hewanted Bennett to study various options.   White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater said the movereflected no change in Bush's opposition to banning such guns butmerely would enforce current law that allows for import of the gunsonly if they are for sporting purposes.   On Feb. 16, Bush told reporters he would ``strongly oppose'' anyattempt to ban semiautomatic weapons despite public concern over anincreasing number of homicides, mostly related to drug violence,involving such guns.   On March 7, Bush told a news conference that he had asked Bennettto look into what could be done about AK-47s, one type ofsemiautomatic rifle, but that he wanted to find a way to ``still dowhat's right by the legitimate sportsman.''   He said solving the problem was ``not as easy as it seems.''   Tuesday's news release in Bennett's name said that TreasurySecretary Nicholas Brady, who has jurisdiction over the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, ``decided to suspend, effectiveimmediately, the importation of several makes of assault-typeweapons pending a decision as to whether these weapons are, asrequired by law, `particularly suitable for or readily adaptable tosporting purposes.'''   Bush, a longtime member of the National Rifle Association,``shares the public concern,'' over the proliferation ofsemiautomatic weapons, said Fitzwater.   Applications so far this year to import such weapons already havepassed the total of the previous three years, Bennett said.   The new policy was announced late in the afternoon, and WhiteHouse officials directed questions about it to Bennett's office,though saying they were not trying to take the spotlight off Bush.   Bush had asked Bennett, who on Monday officially was sworn in asthe nation's ``drug czar,'' to take the lead on looking into ways toaddress the problem, Fitzwater noted.   He said it was coincidence that the move came a day after theCalifornia State Assembly passed a sweeping ban on 40 types ofsemiautomatics.   The National Rifle Association, which has opposed limits onsemiautomatic weapons, reacted with caution to the move, saying itwould ``put a stop to the media hysteria surrounding thesemiautomatic version of the AK-47 rifle, and should provide anatmosphere for a reasoned and sensible debate on this issue.''   ``Today's action by the secretary of the treasury, we trust, willend the rush to come up with ill-conceived and ill-definedlegislative proposals which could turn millions of Americans intofelons and deprive honest citizens of firearms they have lawfullyowned for decades,'' Wayne LaPierre, executive director of the NRAInstitute for Legislative Action, said in a statement.   Rep. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, who is an NRA board member, said,``The problem is not guns themselves, but the criminal element,'' hesaid.   The administration decision came after conferences among Brady,Bennett and Stephen E. Higgins, the director of the Bureau ofAlcohol, Tobacco and Firearms.   Bureau spokesman Dick Pedersen said, ``Higgins and Bennetttogether felt it was time to suspend the importation, so we aredoing that.''   The bureau approved the import of 88,000 semiautomatic weaponsduring 1986, 1987 and 1988. This year so far, the government hasreceived requests to import many more than that _ with 113,732applications pending for import of AKS-type weapons alone, accordingto Bennett's figures.   Affected by the import suspension are AKS-type weapons includingAK-47s, Uzi carbines, FN-FAL and FN-FNC-type weapons as well asSteyr Aug semiautomatic weapons.   Several makes not included are imported only in small numbers andare ``not a problem,'' said Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearmsspokeswoman Dot Koester.   She could not provide a list of weapons made in this country thatwould fall under the category of assault rifle.   ``ATF has the authority to regulate the importation of weaponsinto the United States, to make sure they fall into certaincategories,'' Pedersen said. ``We're saying some of these weaponsmay not fall into some of the prescribed categories, such ashunting.''   The administration's move brought praise from Sen. HowardMetzenbaum, D-Ohio, who has introduced legislation to ban newassault weapons in the United States and to require registration ofsuch weapons already in circulation.   ``This is a major first step but currently nothing prevents themanufacture of these weapons here in the United States,'' Metzenbaumsaid.</TEXT></DOC>
