Holding aloft an Uzi rifle, Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky said,``There is absolutely no reason why anyone should own one of these.We are talking about offensive weapons of war.''   After a noisy hour-long discussion by council members and thepublic, many of them gun owners who opposed the measure, the councilvoted 12-0 for the ban.   Violators of the ordinance will face up to six months in jail anda fine of up to $1,000. The ordinance applies to any semiautomaticrifle that holds 20 or more rounds or a semiautomatic shotgun thatcan be fired more than six times.   The measure was effective immediately. Owners of such guns have15 days to get rid of the firearms or make them inoperable.   Mayor Tom Bradley, calling the weapons ``tools of murder andmayhem whose sole purpose is killing human beings,'' promptly signedthe measure into law.   More than 100 people opposing the ordinance booed those speakingin favor of it, forcing Councilman Marvin Braude to demand quiet incouncil chambers several times.   Robert Cleaves of Los Angeles said violent crime will not bestopped by banning military look-alike weapons, while citizen RobertKahn contended the law would target law-abiding citizens instead ofcriminals.   Some questioned the constitutionality of the law. But CityAttorney James Hahn said he believed it was constitutional, sayingit was ``insane to have ever allowed these weapons to have beensold.''   Yaroslavsky, the sponsor of the ordinance, said he believed thatLos Angeles would be only one of many cities in the area to bansemiautomatic AK-47s, Uzis, and similar weapons.   Indeed, County Supervisor Kenneth Hahn announced Tuesday he willintroduce an ordinance next week to make private ownership ofassault rifles illegal in Los Angeles County.   The action follows a moves by Councilman Nate Holden, who lastmonth began paying people up to $300 per gun to turn in the rifles.Holden is challenging Bradley in the April 11 mayoral election.   Outcry against assault rifles has been strong since the Jan. 17massacre in Stockton, where a drifter sprayed a school playgroundwith more than 100 rounds from a semiautomatic version of an AK-47,killing five children.   Former President Reagan said Monday that the weapons should beoutlawed because they are not intended for hunting or protecting ahome.   The Stockton City Council on Monday unanimously adopted anordinance banning assault rifles, despite protests from gun ownerswho packed a meeting to argue that the ban was unconstitutional.</TEXT></DOC>
