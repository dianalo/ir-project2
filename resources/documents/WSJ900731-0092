Stockfunds took in $1.7 billion more than investors withdrew inJune, a much smaller inflow than May's $4.4 billion. And fundindustry executives say that sales are continuing to slide.   &quot;Business has slowed a little bit,&quot; says Robert Leo,Shearson Lehman Hutton's director of mutual funds. &quot;We're notseeing the level of activity {in stock and bond funds} we sawearlier in the year.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Stock fund inflows in June were the most sluggish sinceJanuary. Sales easily outpaced redemptions during the month,but investors switched more money out of stock funds thanthey switched in.   That pattern continued into July. At Fidelity Investments,stock fund inflows so far this month are down compared withJune. Although new stock fund sales have stayed strong,current holders have taken profits by switching money out ofstock funds and into Fidelity's other funds. MassachusettsFinancial Services, meanwhile, reports a slight net outflowfrom its stock funds this month. Vanguard Group says thatwhile July's net flow into stock funds is comparable withJune's, current holders have been switching out of stockfunds.   But few fund executives are complaining. Despite therecent sales slowdown, 1990 promises to be a banner year formutual fund companies. According to the Investment CompanyInstitute, stock funds have had net inflows of $13.8 billionso far this year, putting the industry on track for its bestyear ever. This figure includes new sales less redemptions,plus the net result of switches between stock funds and otherfunds in the same fund family. Reinvested dividends areexcluded.   Fund managers turned moderately more bullish in June,cutting their cash positions to 10.9% of assets from 11.3% inMay. It was the second consecutive month in which fundmanagers cut back their cash hoards.   But the bulls may have pulled in their horns during July,according to figures from Indata, a service of Gordon,Haskett andamp; Co. Indata, which keeps tabs on 57 stock mutualfunds with $22 billion in assets, says the cash position atthese funds now stands at 10.3%, up from 10% at the end ofJune.   International funds remain the industry's hottest stockfund product, pulling in $3.9 billion so far this year.During July, T. Rowe Price Associates' three internationalfunds accounted for 57% of stock fund sales at theBaltimore-based fund group. Oppenheimer Management Co.'sGlobal Fund has been the fund group's top seller this month,accounting for 30% of all sales. Fidelity's new WorldwideFund, a global stock fund launched in late May, has alreadypulled in $71 million. A global mutual fund can invest bothin the U.S. and internationally.   Among bond funds, &quot;there's been an internationalshort-term bond product that has really caught the public'simagination,&quot; says Shearson's Mr. Leo. Since the marketingsuccess of the $2.4 billion Alliance Short-Term Multi-MarketFund, which invests in foreign bonds with less than threeyears to maturity, other fund groups have been rushing tobring out similar products. The SLH Short Term World IncomeFund, which was brought out this month, has pulled in $100million. The Merrill Lynch Short-Term Global Income Fund,launched in June, has raised $1.3 billion so far.   In June, high-yielding junk bond funds pulled in $171million more than they surrendered to departing holders. Thatmarked the second month in a row of positive net inflowsafter 10 months in which junk funds hemorrhaged assets.   But overall, June was a slower month for bond fund sales.Despite the upturn in junk, bond funds had net inflows ofjust $1 billion, half of May's total. The biggest losers weregovernment bond funds, which lost $719 million.   Bond fund sales appear to have recovered in July. Fidelityreports strong new net inflows, with long-term governmentbond funds, municipal bond funds and junk among the biggestwinners. At Vanguard, July's net inflows into taxable fundsare running 40% ahead of June, and sales of municipal fundsare 35% ahead of last month's pace.   At Franklin Resources, July's gross sales of municipalbond funds are up 18% from June's pace. Much of the moneywent into municipal bond funds holding bonds with maturitiesof 20 years or longer.   Gregory Johnson, a marketing vice president at Franklin,says investors' interest in long-term munis probably reflectsfears of rising state and federal taxes and the prospect of adecline in interest rates.   Acorn Fund, one of the top performing small-company growthfunds, has closed its doors to new investors.   The $950 million fund said that its assets have beengrowing rapidly and that its size was getting &quot;unwieldy&quot; inrelation to its investment objective. Current Acorn Fundholders still can add to their accounts.   The fund, managed by Ralph Wanger since 1970, returned16.7% a year for the decade ended in June, compared with13.9% for the average small-company growth fund tracked byLipper Analytical Services Inc. Acorn Fund joins adistinguished list of top funds that are closed to newinvestors, including Mutual Shares, Sequoia Fund and WindsorFund.</TEXT></DOC>
