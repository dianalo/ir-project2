LEDERER</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Foreign Secetary Sir Geoffrey Howe denounced anybargain for release of British hostages in Lebanon, while a MiddleEastern newspaper said it had obtained reports that those captiveswould soon be freed.   Howe spoke Thursday amid rising hopes that a recent series ofcontacts between Britain and Iran could lead to the early return ofa British diplomat to Tehran and negotiations for the Britishhostages.   But he told the Association of American Correspondents that thisweek's private visit of four British lawmakers to Tehran had notchanged Britain's policicies toward Iran or the hostages.   The Parliamentary delegation, the first to visit Iran since the1979 revolution, said Wednesday that Iran had agreed to use itsinfluence to try to obtain the release of the British hostages. Thedelegation urged Britain to post a diplomat to Tehran.   Meanwhile, the Al-Khaleej newspaper in Sharjah, United ArabEmirates, reported Thursday that Church of England envoy TerryWaite and some other hostages held in Lebanon have been taken toIran, where they will be freed soon.   The publication, which is usually reliable, quoted ``informedLebanese sources'' in its front-page report, which said the otherhostages involved ``are believed to be British too.''   The daily said Waite and the other hostages were moved fromtheir kidnappers' hideouts in the Shiite Moslem-dominated slums ofsouth Beirut by Iranian Revolutionary Guards last month.   The Guards had been fighting alongside guerrillas of thepro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, against the Syrian-backedShiite Amal militia.   They left south Beirut under the cease-fire brokered by Syriaand Iran that ended three weeks of fierce fighting, al-Khaleejreported.   It said the Guards took Waite and the other captives first tothe Syrian capital of Damascus and then to Tehran.   It was not clear whether the Syrians were aware the hostageswere being moved.   The daily said the captives ``are expected to be released withinthe coming few days.''   However, other reports have said the hostages are held in aHezbollah barracks ringed by Syrian troops in south Beirut.   Mohammad Akhoond Zadeh Basti, Iran's charge d'affaires inLondon, said Wednesday night he was ``very optimistic'' that theimprovement in diplomatic relations could lead to the release ofWaite, journalist John McCarthy and teacher Brian Keenan.   But Howe said Britain's relations with Iran remained ``at a verylow ebb'' because of ``the shameful way'' in which British diplomatEdward Chaplin was abducted and beaten by Iranian agents in TehranMay 28, 1987. Britain reduced its ties with Iran to a caretakerstatus following the incident and ordered its diplomats home.   The foreign secretary stressed that the Parliamentary missionwas organized by Archbishop of Canterbury Robert Runcie of theChurch of England _ not the government.   Waite, McCarthy and Keenan are among 18 foreign hostages held inLebanon. The longest held is Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent of The Associated Press. He was abducted March 16,1985.   France and Iran named ambassadors to each other's countriesThursday, one week after restoring diplomatic relations. Theappointments were linked to the return of the last three Frenchhostages from Lebanon.</TEXT></DOC>
