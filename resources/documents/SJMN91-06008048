The competition here is mostly from start-up firms thathave established beachheads with sophisticated niche products.;    Forexample, Cisco Systems Inc. of Menlo Park, a leading supplier ofinter-networking equipment, is about one-twentieth the size of Novell.;   Analysts who follow 3Com have lately been expecting some corporaterealignment, but were surprised by the scope of the announcement, especiallythe layoffs and the write-down.;    &quot;It's going to be pretty wrenching,&quot; saidTherese M. Murphy of Smith Barney's San Francisco offices, who said she nowexpects the company to lose 99 cents a share this fiscal year, ending May,rather than post a 60 cents profit.;    Murphy, though, said the changes wereprobably for the firm's long-term good.;    Eric Benhamou, in his first yearas 3Com's president and chief operating officer, said the layoffs of about 250people were effective immediately and are evenly distributed throughout thecompany. Employees being cut will be given two months' severance pay, hesaid.;    He said the $45 million was a conservative estimate of the costsinvolved in the various transitions. He said while the third quarter, endingFeb. 28, would show a loss, he said he expects the firm to return toprofitability in the next quarter.;    The announcement was made after closeof business on the stock exchanges, where 3Com's shares closed at $7.75, down13 cents, in Over-the-Counter trading. That stock had been as high as $19 lastJuly, but fell from $13 to $7 the following month after the company forecastlower sales.;    3Com currently gets 60 percent of its nearly $420 million inannual revenues through the sale of adapter cards, which connect individualpersonal computers to a network cable. The company makes its cardsinexpensively in a highly automated Santa Clara manufacturing site, andBenhamou said it has no plans to leave that business, where it is the industryleader.;    The field of inter-networking, where products have such names as&quot;bridges&quot; and &quot;routers,&quot; is one where 3Com's products currently lag behindcompetitors.;    Benhamou said, though, that the realignments announced Mondaywill allow the company to shift engineering and other resources to catch up.Already, he said the firm had several breakthrough products waiting in thewings.; Shifting gears; In a move to refocus its networking business, 3Comwill:; (box) Lay off 12 percent of its workers -- about 250 people.; (box)Take a $45 million charge in the fourth quarter, meaning a loss for the fiscalyear.; (box) Sell its &quot;work group&quot; related business of networking software andthe computers it runs on.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  LEE GOMES, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910108  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Tuesday  </DAY><MONTH>  January  </MONTH><PG.COL>  6D  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  608  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Tuesday January 8, 199100008048,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
