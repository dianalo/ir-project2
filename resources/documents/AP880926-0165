His campaign manager, James A. Baker III, told reporters inWinston-Salem, N.C., that Bush has thought the issue through anddecided women are ``additional victims'' and should not be punishedfor undergoing abortions.   But Bush still believes in the possibility of ``punishment asfar as the abortionist is concerned,'' Baker said.   The head of a pro-choice group said Bush's remarks had``horrified'' many women. An anti-abortion leader called the issue``a red herring'' and said no one envisions jailing women who getabortions.   Bush, who favors a Constitutional ban on most abortions, wasasked Sunday night if women and doctors who defied a ban onabortion should go to jail.   ``I haven't sorted out the penalties,'' Bush replied. ``I'm forthe sanctity of life, and once that illegality is established, thenwe can come to grips with the penalty side, and of course, there'sgot to be some penalties to enforce the law.''   Bush himself told reporters later Monday in Jackson, Tenn.,there was ``no change'' in his stance.   ``He horrified women last night,'' said Kate Michelman,executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.``If he believes that abortion is murder, this business of sayingwomen are the second victims is hypocritical.''   ``What he advocates is a policy of forced childbirth for everywomen who gets pregnant,'' she said. ``The result would be thatwomen would be forced to seek back-alley, medically unsafeabortions as we did before 1973. Women would have to risk theirlives and be butchered once again.''   Douglas Johnson, legislative director for the National Right toLife Committee, said that neither his group nor others want to sendwomen who seek abortions to jail. He called that ``a non-issue, ared herring.''   But ``we do think the doctors who profit from killing unbornchildren should be punished,'' including loss of their licenses, headded.   Democrat Michael Dukakis seized upon Bush's comment during theirdebate, saying, ``He's prepared to brand a woman a criminal formaking this choice.''   Dukakis said he does not favor abortion, but believes ``it hasto be the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religiousbeliefs that makes that decision.'' As governor of Massachusetts,he has vetoed bills that sought to restrict funding of abortionsfor poor women.   Baker, in explaining his clarification of Bush's position, said:``After thinking about it overnight, we went in and discussed itthis morning and concluded it was an issue that should be addressedand we addressed it.''   ``Frankly, he thinks that a woman in a situation like that wouldbe more properly considered an additional victim _ perhaps thesecond victim _ (and) that she would need help and love and notpunishment,'' Baker said.   Susan Estrich, Dukakis' campaign manager, said Bush has alteredhis stance on abortion four times. The nation needs a decisivepresident, ``not someone who will change his mind after anovernight meeting with his pollsters,'' Estrich said.   She said the Constitutional amendment to ban abortion that Bushnow favors _ after opposing it in 1980 before becoming RonaldReagan's running mate _ ``would leave states free to imposecriminal penalties on women who have abortions.''   Bush opposes abortions except to save the mother's life or incases of rape or incest. He supports government funding ofabortions only to save the mother's life. He favors overturning the1973 Supreme Court decision, Roe vs. Wade, that struck down statelaws against abortion, and passage of a human life amendment to theConstitution to protect the unborn.   Some 1.5 million abortions are performed in the United Statesannually, compared with 586,760 in 1972, when abortion was legal inonly a few states.   Johnson estimates that before abortions were legalized in NewYork and elsewhere in the 1960s, some 200,000 were performedillegally each year.   To Michelman's argument that more women would be killed ifabortions were outlawed again, Johnson said that would be ``atragedy,'' but there would still be ``a tremendous savings in humanlife ... when one recognizes that at least one human being dies inevery abortion.''</TEXT></DOC>
