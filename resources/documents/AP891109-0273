An administrative court in the city of Kassel issued a temporaryinjunction Wednesday saying the giant West German company cannotroceed with its plans as long as there is no federal law governinggene technology. Such legislation is not expected to go into effectbefore the start of 1991.   The ruling, which reversed an earlier decision, sparked concernabout West Germany's ability to compete in the high-technologyfield of genetic engineering.   The court gave no final verdict on the substance of the case,based on the suit filed by two citizens in 1985 against the Hessestate government's license for the insulin project.   The spread of genetic technology is opposed by environmentalgroups and parts of the German general public.   Hoechst, which is based in Frankfurt, said it will suspendconstruction on the project for the time being and said it does notexpect a quick settlement of the dispute.   The company said it views developments ``with great concernbecause the future of the industrial use of genetic technology inGermany thus remains in limbo.''   Hesse state governor Walter Wallmann said the court verdictaffects ``the position of all of West German industry'' and urgedfederal authorities to speed work on the legislation.   The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung daily newspaer said thedelay, ``which could last for years, is even more painful for thecompany because its competition abroad can meanwhile gainexperience with the new technology.''   The 70-million-mark (about $38 million) Hoechst project involvesmaking human insulin for diabetics from genetically alteredbacteria. Pilot production was due to start early next year.Hoechst currently makes insulin from the pancreas of pigs.   Wednesday's court decision can be challenged only in WestGermany's Constitutional Court. Hoechst officials headquarters inFrankfurt declined to say whether they plan an appeal.</TEXT></DOC>
