The dipole anisotropy is related to density fluctuationson large scales and to other determinations of our motion relative todistant galaxies. Observation and theory are coming tantalizingly closeto measuring the elusive anisotropy, or to revealing that the ideas aboutthe origin of galaxies and large-scale structures are in need of substantialrevision.</TEXT></DOC>
