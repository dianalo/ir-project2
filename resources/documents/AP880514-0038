Manuel Antonio Noriega vowed notto give in to U.S. demands that he step down as Panama's militaryleader after claiming negotiations with the Reagan administrationhad fallen apart.   In Washington on Friday, the White House said U.S. officialsstill were talking with Noriega about his resignation. ButNoriega's spokesman said the general would refuse any deal thatincludes a deadline for such a departure.   A U.S. attorney prosecuting Noriega on drug charges, meanwhile,sharply criticized the reported U.S. offer to throw out the chargesin exchange for Noriega's resignation as Defense Forces chief andat least temporary exile.   Asked Friday about the talks, Noriega said: ``Everything fellapart.''   Later, he said: ``The dignity of Panama is not negotiable whilethere are foreign troops on our territory, humiliating our soil,while there is economic aggression, as long as there are threats,as long as there is psychological war ... as long as (U.S.)Ambassador Arthur Davis does not get out.''   Noriega spoke with reporters Friday at ceremonies in this ruraltown, 90 miles from Panama City, on the anniversary of the death ofa revolutionary hero, and during a meeting with local officials inRio Hato, 60 miles southwest of the capital.   Asked in Washington about Noriega's comments, White Housespokesman Marlin Fitzwater said: ``He says that all the time. Hesaid `fall apart' or something similar before. ... We are stilltalking. We are still negotiating.''   The Reagan administration has been trying through economicsanctions to pressure Noriega into stepping down since February,when he was indicted in Florida on drug-trafficking charges.   As military chief, Noriega is the country's de facto ruler.   The general said Friday that State Department envoy MichaelKozak was in Panama, but added: ``I have not talked with Mr.Kozak.''   Maj. Edgardo Lopez, Noriega's spokesman, said there was littlevariety in what the United States has been offering.   ``The thing is Kozak comes each time with the same plan, theoriginal plan a little more elastic,'' he said.   ``The plan has a deadline for (Noriega) resigning his post, adeadline for leaving the country ... With those conditions and thatpressure neither the general nor any other Panamanian nor any LatinAmerican will cede.''   In Washington, Reagan administration officials acknowledgeddiscussing with Noriega the possibility of dropping the drugcharges in exchange for his departure from power.   But Attorney General Edwin Meese III on Friday argued againstdismissing the drug charges, said U.S. Attorney Leon Kellner ofMiami, who obtained one of the indictments.   Kellner said dropping the drug charges ``would send the wrongmessage'' to Americans.   U.S. Customs Service Chief William von Raab, whose agency'sinvestigation contributed to the drug indictments against Noriega,also said Friday that Noriega should be prosecuted.   Noriega's lawyers plan to appear in court to request dismissalof the drug charges in about a month. They contend the charges arepolitically motivated.   In La Negrita, Noriega did not address the crowd, but listenedto three speeches by local authorities denouncing ``Yankeeaggression.''   When a reporter asked if he could run for president in electionsscheduled for next May, he smiled broadly.   ``Legally, yes,'' he answered, surrounded by supporters.   Asked if he was actively considering running for president,Noriega merely laughed.   A ``dignity battalion'' of about 100 men attended the ceremony.They had vintage rifles and were dressed in blue jeans, T-shirtsprinted with ``not one step backward,'' and red-and-white baseballcaps saying ``I don't sell out my country.''   The United States still recognizes Eric Arturo Delvalle, now inhiding, as Panama's legitimate president. Noriega had him dismissedon Feb. 26, the day after Delvalle tried to fire the general.</TEXT></DOC>
