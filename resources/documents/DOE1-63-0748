Changes in load needs frequent adjustment of individual gasifiersteam flows followed by oxygen flow according to a set ratio. The rateof coal filling and ash extraction also requires adjustment during loadchanges. Automation of the process presents a difficult and challengingtask to which Sasol has become increasingly committed over the years.Initially the gasifiers were essentially manually operated but as newplants were built and production consolidated, the need to maximise theproduction capability of individual gasifiers increased and considerableefforts were made towards automation of the process. Considerable successhad been achieved by implementing changes stepwise and by utilising themost advanced instrumentation technology available. This paper describesthe main features of the process and reviews the historical improvementsmade in automation. The most recent developments, automation in conceptualfuture plants and opportunities and limitations towards fully automatedcomputer control are discussed. 3 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
