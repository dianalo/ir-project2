The State Department issued the highly unusual protest last week in response to reports that Col. Aviem Sella, who was named an unindicted co-conspirator in the Pollard spy case, would be promoted to commander of Israel's largest air force base.    According to U.S. officials, Israel responded by telling the U.S. that Col. Sella was an outstanding officer and that it was time to put the Pollard affair behind the two allied countries.    Meanwhile, senior Justice Department prosecutors, after months of discussions and sensitive negotiations with Israel, have decided to seek criminal charges against Col. Sella for his role in the Pollard case, according to U.S. law-enforcement officials. They said an indictment could come as early as today.    At the State Department briefing yesterday, Phyllis Oakley, the deputy spokeswoman, recalled that Israel had said at the time Mr. Pollard's espionage activities came to light that &quot;any Israeli involved would be called to account. We expect the government of Israel to stand by these undertakings.&quot;    A spokesman at the Israeli Embassy here said Israel wouldn't comment on the U.S. protest. </TEXT></DOC>
