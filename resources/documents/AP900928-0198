The Dow plunged nearly 50 points, piercing the 2,400-levelshortly after the opening bell and then regained its footing atmixed levels. Many analysts considered the 2,400 mark a criticalfloor. Sinking beneath that level meant the key barometer had lost600 points, or lost 20 percent in value from its peak six weeksago.   Marc Chandler, an analyst at IDEA, predicted that once the Dowfell through 2,400, it would be ``off to the races.'' Manyinvestors headed for the security of the bond market or kept theirmoney in cash in a trend being felt worldwide.
