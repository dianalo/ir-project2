Thisstudy has endeavored to assess the potential for energy conservationby first assessing these areas where conservation is potentially possible,determining the magnitude of the saving that could result, and investigatingthe constraints associated which could impact on the penetration of thesetechniques into the industry. The study has attempted to look at theindustry in not only a general context but also in terms of regionaland store type differences. A complete list was compiled of all energysaving techniques which have been implemented in various retail foodoutlets across Canada. An exclusive survey was undertaken to determinethe extent to which the identified techniques are usually practiced.The major overall conclusion of the study is that there exists a substantialpotential for energy conservation in this sector. To date very littleof the potential for energy use reduction has been realized. The reasonsfor the lack of progress in this area stem from four major deficiencies:the lack of verified technical and economic data with which to make reasonableinvestment decisions, the lack of a means of disseminating energy conservationinformation to the store level where it is most required, the lack ofa means of effectively instituting energy conservation programs at thestore level, and the lack of experience of the industry with many ofthe potential means of reducing energy consumption, and hence the fearof adversely affecting marketing. 3 refs., 9 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
