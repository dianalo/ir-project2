Among other things, the grand jury impaneled early last year byindependent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh is believed to be focusing onMeese's Nov. 22-23, 1986 investigation that uncovered the diversionof arms-sale profits to the Nicraguan rebels.   In recent weeks, the grand jury has heard testimony by AssistantAttorney General William Bradford Reynolds, who found a memorevealing the diversion in National Security Council files, andAssistant Attorney General Charles J. Cooper, another member of theteam.   Former White House chief of staff Donald T. Regan, who waspresent when President Reagan ordered Meese to conduct theinvestigation and also when the attorney general reported hisfindings, has testified recently.   Meese also has testified six other times before a differentgrand jury investigating his financial dealings with a formerofficer of the scandal-plagued Wedtech Corp.   The attorney general has refused to comment on his grand juryappearances, but the Justice Department says he is cooperating withthe investigation and is not a target of Walsh's probe.   Meese's investigation was criticized by congressional committeesthat held hearings last summer on the Iran-Contra affair. Thepanels faulted Meese for not recruiting Justice Department lawyerswith more experience investigating criminal cases and for failingto take notes during interviews with top administration officialsafter he learned about the diversion.   The congressional committees said Meese's failure to secureNational Security Council files allowed documents to be shredded bythen-national security adviser John M. Poindexter, NSC aide Lt.Col. Oliver L. North and others.   Poindexter resigned and North was fired after Meese announcedthat arms-sale profits had been diverted to the Contra rebels.   Poindexter and North are targets of the Walsh's investigation.Indictments are expected to be returned in the coming weeks.</TEXT></DOC>
