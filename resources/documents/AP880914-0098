(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   An IRS agent says he found no legitimatebusiness purpose for a personal 300-foot water slide, twoRolls-Royces and hundreds of thousands of dollars that Jim andTammy Bakker and a key aide got through PTL.   Larry Howlett, an auditor of tax-exempt organizations, was thesecond witness Tuesday in the trial of the ministry's $52 millionclaim against the Bakkers and former PTL aide David Taggart. Thetrial began Monday in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.   Under cross-examination today, Howlett conceded that because ofa lack of documentation, he could only assume that a businesspurpose was lacking and that the expenditures were for personal use.   PTL attorneys are seeking to force the Bakkers and Taggart torepay the money they say was lost through through mismanagement offunds that included cash advances on PTL credit cards andunjustified compensation and benefits.   Howlett listed among the expenditures with no legitimatebusiness purpose a 300-foot water slide at Bakker's Lake Wyliehome, which has since been sold, and $32,000 worth of luggage.   Bakker attorney Ryan Hovis asked Howlett today whether theRolls-Royces and two Mercedes were solely for the personal use ofthe Bakkers.   ``PTL's check paid for them, but the paperwork was inconclusiveas to who the owner was,'' Howlett said. ``There's no documentationthat Bakker used the cars.''   On Tuesday, Howlett testified that the IRS could find nodocumentation to support the business purpose of about $300,000 incash advances made to Bakker and Taggart between 1984 and 1986.   ``There was no back-up documentation for any of the cashadvances, none of them,'' Howlett said. ``We tried to evaluate thebusiness nature of these items, but we could not determine any.''   Howlett also testified that records show neither Bakker norTaggart attempted to reimburse the ministry for money taken fromthree executive accounts.   The PTL television ministry and Heritage USA theme park at FortMill filed for reorganization in bankruptcy court in June 1987,three months after Bakker left the ministry amid a sex and moneyscandal involving church secretary Jessica Hahn.   Earlier Tuesday, a former PTL accountant said he was frustratedthat Bakker and other top ministry executives continually ignoredhis memos warning that the ministry financially was facing ``realemergencies.''   Peter Bailey, who was an accountant and financial director atPTL from June 1979 through July 1987, also testified that topexecutives received bonuses in anticipation of money coming intothe ministry's coffers, but that there was often no money in thebank to cover those bonuses.   Hovis said Tuesday that U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Rufus Reynolds isexpected to adjourn the trial after this week's testimony. ``We'llprobably present our case in a month or so,'' Hovis said during abreak in the hearing.   The Bakkers and Taggart stayed away from the hearing againtoday, just as they have skipped preceding sessions. Hovis has saidhe will call them as witnesses.</TEXT></DOC>
