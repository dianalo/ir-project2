It counts among its negotiating coups the release in January1981 of Americans who were held hostage at the U.S. Embassy in Iran.   This North African country's envoys are once again playing therole of mediator: this time in the hostage crisis in Lebanon.   Algeria is no stranger to that country's turmoil. ThoughAlgeria's exact role never has been spelled out, French officialsthanked the nation publicly after French hostages were released bypro-Iranian groups in Lebanon in 1987-1988.   ``We have a skill that we put at the disposal of theinternational community,'' the Algerian ambassador to Washington,Mohammed Sahnoun, told reporters in April 1988. He spoke afterShiite Moslem hijackers of a Kuwaiti jetliner gave up the plane inAlgeria and were apparently allowed to escape.   Sahnoun said he could not provide details of the agreementbecause it would break Algeria's word to the hijackers and damageits chances of helping in such situations in the future.   Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and former Secretaryof State George Shultz criticized the decision to release theKuwaiti hijackers, who killed two passengers.   In response, Algeria rejected what it called an effort ``tofling discredit on an action which saved precious human lives frommurderous violence.''   Perhaps the most prominent Algerian success came Jan. 20, 1981,when American hostages held 444 days in Tehran stepped off anairliner at the Algiers airport.   Iran and the United States had cut a deal _ after months ofmediation by Algerian diplomats.   ``A happy ending might change the American view that we arecommunists,'' a senior Algerian official said at the time.   After a war with France that led to independence in 1962,Algeria pursued socialist policies and shaped close ties with theSoviet Union and radical Moslem groups.   While Algeria is often in clear sympathy with the aims ofradical organizations, it has steered clear of supporting terroristtactics.   In October 1977, Algerian officials negotiated at the foot of aJapanese DC-8 hijacked by guerrillas from a group known as the RedArmy. The Algerians helped win freedom for hostages in exchange fora $6 million ransom and the release of six of the militants'comrades in Japanese jails.   In this case, the hijackers also were apparently allowed toleave Algeria.</TEXT></DOC>
