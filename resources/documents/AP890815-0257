But spokesmen for unions striking another of the four so-called``Baby Bell'' companies, Bell Atlantic Corp., said bargaining wasgoing slowly.   ``I believe this is going to be a long strike,'' said JohnCremmy, an executive board member of Local 827 of the InternationalBrotherhood of Electrical Workers. ``I estimate at least a month,maybe longer.''   Nearly 200,000 operators, clerks, technicians and other workersare on strike against the four regional telephone companies in 20states and the District of Columbia.   Only Pacific Bell had official contract talks in progressTuesday. Company spokeswoman Lynn Jimenez refused to disclose anydetails of the negotiations. No other talks were announced.   Most customers have noticed the strike only through delays inservices such as directory assistance, but strikers said a fewthunderstorms knocking down telephone lines could put the companiesin trouble.   A Bell Atlantic subsidiary, New Jersey Bell, reported five casesof sabotage Tuesday. Lines were cut some time during the morning byaxes and hacksaws, causing about 2,000 customers in four towns tolose service. Service was expected to be restored by mid-evening,officials said.   The companies affected are:   _New York-based NYNEX, which serves about 50 percent of New Yorkstate, a small part of Connecticut and the five other New Englandstates. Its companies have 60,000 workers on strike. Some 10.3million customers are affected.   _Philadelphia-based Bell Atlantic, which has subsidiaries serving12.7 million customers in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Maryland,Delaware, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. Ithas 52,000 workers on strike.   _San Francisco-based Pacific Telesis Group, whose twosubsidiaries serve 13.2 million customers in parts of California andall of Nevada. More than 40,000 CWA members are striking.   _Chicago-based Ameritech, which owns companies serving 12 millioncustomers in Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Wisconsin and Michigan. It has35,000 employees belonging to the CWA on strike. An additional12,500 employees, members of the IBEW, have ratified agreements withthe companies.   NYNEX and the CWA announced informal contract talks for Wednesdayafter company president Fred Salerno appealed for calm.   Salerno's appeal came one day after cable splicer Edward G.Horgan, 34, was fatally injured when he mounted the hood of a cardriven by a non-striking telephone employee on the service road of aNYNEX facility in the New York City suburb of Mount Pleasant.   Horgan pounded on the windshield, but slid off and hit his headon the pavement, police said. The union disputed that, saying hefell onto the hood and the 18-year-old driver accelerated. Nocharges were filed.   Horgan died of head injuries at 1:15 p.m. Tuesday, said unionspokeswoman Clara Allen.   Salerno said he had called CWA Vice President Jan Pierce with hisconcerns, ``and he and I agreed the best way of approaching it is totry and calm the waters and try and find a way back to thenegotiating table.''   In Philadelphia, however, a CWA spokesman said the telephonecompany was negotiating at a snail's pace.   ``Yesterday, the company got back to our proposal of four daysago,'' union spokesman Bob Schlacter said Tuesday.   ``They offered shallow changes,'' Schlacter said. ``Our union wasall over them because they took four days to make these smallchanges. We are still far apart on major issues.''   Informal negotiations between the CWA and Bell Atlantic occurredin Washington on Tuesday and further talks are expected Wednesday,company spokesman Larry Plumb said.   Ken Pitt, a Bell Atlantic spokesman, said the company was waitingfor the CWA to respond to its latest offer.   Three other companies have reached settlements with the CWA andthe IBEW. They are Atlanta-based Bell South, Denver-based US Westand St. Louis-based Southwestern Bell.   In West Virginia, meanwhile, the Chesapeake andamp; Potomac TelephoneCo. said it was repairing damage by vandals that had left 8,000customers without operator service or an emergency 911 connection inPutnam and Kanawha counties.   Also, two union members striking the New York Telephone Co. werecharged with harassment in Erie County after a company managercomplained they followed his service truck to a job and screamedinsults at him.   In Newark, N.J., more than 700 striking telephone workers stageda noisy rally outside New Jersey Bell's state headquarters Tuesdayto protest the benefits package offered by the company.   ``This strike is not against the people of New Jersey but againstthe company that refuses to give benefits,'' said Terry Caggiano, aninformation operator in Newark.</TEXT></DOC>
