Unfortunately, Lord Keynes's theories too often receive unfair criticism. He espoused fiscal measures to dampen the swings of the business cycle. Stripped of nuance, at the onset of a recession he advocated increased government spending and/or lowering of taxes to stimulate the economy. According to Keynes, although such measures would increase debt, they would have the salutary effect of spending ourselves out of &quot;bad&quot; times. What is not cited by the Keynes bashers is that he also advocated paying back the incurred debt once the economy was on the upswing and &quot;good&quot; times were anticipated. This would be accomplished by cutting government spending and/or raising taxes. An excellent theory shouldn't be faulted because politicians have wanted to exercise only the easy part of the theory by spending and/or lowering taxes.    Michael W.
