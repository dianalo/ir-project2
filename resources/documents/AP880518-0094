A New Zealand military aircraft that took riot gear to Vanuatureturned home today with more than 25 New Zealanders aboard. Thegovernment of Prime Minister David Lange said it would keepmonitoring the situation in Vanuatu.   ``There is no doubt about a Libyan connection in Vanuatu,'' saidHawke, following reports in the Australian media thatLibyan-trained activists were involved in Monday's riots in thecapital of Port Vila.   Police said 30 people were arrested after a march by 2,000villagers in Port Vila became a riot, with protesters looting shopsand smashing store windows.   Australia also airlifted supplies of riot control gear at therequest of the Vanuatu government, headed by Prime Minister WalterLini, who also is an Anglican priest.   ``Lini is the democratically elected head of a government of afriendly country ... and Australia can't stand idly by if there areattempts to undermine by non-democratic process that government,''Hawke told reporters.   He presented no evidence to back up his charge against Libya.   Vanuatu, formerly the Anglo-French New Hebrides, wasadministered jointly by Britain and France from 1906 until 1980,when it achieved independence. The island group is 1,200 milesnortheast of the Australian city of Brisbane and has a populationof 130,000.   Vanuatu sent shockwaves through the generally pro-Western SouthPacific when it decided in 1986 to establish diplomatic relationswith Libya and the Soviet Union.   Villagers from three tribes decided to march on Lini's officefollowing last week's closure of the Vila Urban Land Corp. Thegovernment agency administered leases for land on which Port Vila,a town of 15,000 people, is built and which the tribes say belongto them by tradition.   The official Radio Vanuatu said today that life was slowly``trickling back'' despite injuries and extensive damage to shopsand offices. It said Lini requested civil servants to return towork and help repair the damage.</TEXT></DOC>
