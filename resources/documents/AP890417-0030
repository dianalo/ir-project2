In what amounted to a coup against the oil workers union,Salinas used the army to arrest allegedly corrupt union leaders inJanuary.   He jailed stockbrokers accused of fraudulent practices a monthlater.   This month, alleged drug kingpin Miguel Angel Felix Gallardo wasarrested.   It is all part of Salinas' battle to regain the confidence ofMexicans who blame corruption for seven years of lost economicopportunity.   If he fails, some analysts say, his Institutional RevolutionaryParty could lose its hold on power. Such observers hold thatSalinas has been on the attack since taking office Dec. 1 becausehe has no choice.   ``Salinas has to go against his own government, its owncollaborators, to regain legitimacy. He realizes that if thepatronage system continues, it's going to collapse in uponitself,'' said Samuel del Villar, a political scientist at theColegio de Mexico and adviser to Salinas' predecessor, formerPresident Miguel de la Madrid.   Salinas' election in July was the most disputed in the historyof the party, which has governed Mexico since it was founded 60years ago. He won just more than half the vote, but reportsabounded of multiple voting, stolen ballot boxes and other fraud.   ``The results of July 6 were as much a rebellion againstcorruption as they were against the government,'' del Villar said.   Salinas faces a skeptical public; every Mexican president inrecent decades has come into office boldly declaring theirintention to battle corruption.   He has inherited cynicism over the failure of his predecessorsto tackle corruption fueled by the oil-boom years. Many stillbitterly criticize Jose Lopez Portillo, claiming he and his alliesstole the country blind _ claims Portillo denies.   He was followed in 1982 by de la Madrid, ``the last presidentwho held public confidence that he could confront corruption, andhe lost it,'' del Villar said.   De la Madrid's campaign for honest government failed, ``socorruption spread extraordinarily,'' del Villar said.   Salinas has been forced to attack the very elements that, withPRI patronage, have kept the party in power.   Oil union chief Joaquin Hernandez Galicia and stockbrokerEduardo Legoretta were considered untouchable before Salinas jailedthem.   In drug trafficking havens, top dealers were sometimes called``narco-politicians'' _ before April 8, when Salinas had FelixGallardo thrown in jail.   He also had army troops arrest hundreds of police in FelixGallardo's home town of Culiacan, sweeping up officials whoallegedly protected the so-called ``godfather'' of Mexico's cocainetrade.   Salinas' threat to follow up those arrests with more in otherstates where drug trafficking is strong sent dozens of lawenforcement officials scurrying for cover, according to newsreports.   ``De la Madrid went after marginal people; Salinas is going forthe central figures,'' del Villar said.   Salinas is up against a centuries-old mix of corruption that hasinfested Mexico's traditional authoritarian structure of government.   In his recent ``La Capital: The Biography of Mexico City,''Jonathan Kandell writes of the turn-of-the-century:   ``Gendarmes were forced to prey on the poor in order to coverkickbacks demanded from them by their higher officers. That systemcontinues today, with cars with U.S. license plates favored targetsfor a quick shakedown.''   Decades later, Mexico City police Chief Arturo Durazo recruitedknown drug traffickers, smugglers and car thieves to create ``amore proficient racketeering empire,'' Kandell says.   Salinas also has staked his presidency _ and the continuation ofhis party's claim to authority _ on his ability to pull Mexico outof seven years of economic crisis that has sliced paychecks in half.   ``Corruption is worst where the economic activity is moststrategic,'' del Villar said.   He said Salinas, a Harvard-educated economist, jailed Legorettaand Hernandez Galicia because ``the brokerage firms, like the oilworkers union, weren't filling a productive role in the economy.''   Indeed, Mexican officials hope to gain billions of dollars inextra profits from a more efficient, less corrupt petroleumindustry.   Salinas' crackdowns have earned Salinas kudos from the Bushadministration, whose help he needs to reduce Mexico'sgrowth-strangling $107 billion foreign debt.   ``His credibility in Washington has soared,'' says politicalscientist Adolfo Aguilar Zinser.   Whether that translates into electoral gains at home remains tobe seen.   Still, Salinas' campaign has impressed even some cynics.   ``The surprising thing about the arrests ... isn't that certainpolice are accused of corruption, but that they're being punishedfor it,'' wrote political scientist Lorenzo Meyer in the MexicoCity daily Excelsior.</TEXT><NOTE>__</NOTE><TEXT>   EDITOR'S NOTE: Jim Anderson has covered Mexico for TheAssociated Press since December 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
