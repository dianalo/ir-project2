Here was LosAngeles's first big health center run by blacks and builtright in the middle of the black community.   It was a new day dawning. But of racial harmony? Notexactly. These days King Hospital, born in the shadow of thedevastating Watts riot, is a virtual combat zone itself,thick with racial tension, charges of bias -- and even theoccasional death threat. Read this letter that JessePalacios, a case manager who has worked at King for 19 years,found stuffed in his office mailbox a few months ago:</LP><TEXT>   &quot;We Heard Your The Ones Whos Been Starting All These WetBacks To Uprise Against All Of Us Who Havebrrn Here At KingFor A Long Time,&quot; the note said. &quot;IfYou Continue To Try AndTake Our Jobs Away Were Just Going To Have To Stopyoou, . ..If We Have To, Will Make An Expmle By Blowing Your HeadOff.&quot;   This is the sound of the new racism in Watts. Mr.Palacios, a trim man of 40, is Hispanic. The anonymouswriter, he assumes from what has been happening at King, isblack. The Watts neighborhood that Mr. Palacios serves wasoverwhelmingly black when the hospital opened in 1972. Today,it is about 50% Hispanic. But King Hospital, built on thepremise that a hospital's staff should reflect itsneighborhood, hasn't kept up with the times. Just 11% of itswork force of nearly 3,500 is Hispanic. The rest is black --and there's the rub. The very hospital built to answer racialinjustice has now been charged by the county and federalgovernment with its own racial discrimination.   The controversy at King Hospital represents a new fact oflife in America: As the proportion of different minoritiesgrows in the U.S., and as they become more politicallypowerful, they aren't always joining forces for a commonpolitical goal. At the grass-roots, they are prone to thesame protect-your-own-turf attitudes that have long souredblack-white relations. When asked about the troubles at King,John Mack, head of the Los Angeles Urban League, knowinglysounds a theme long used by whites to exclude blacks fromschools, neighborhoods and jobs. Blacks &quot;are entitled to haveour own institutions,&quot; he argues. For others to conclude thatKing discriminates against Hispanics, or that the center'sleadership should be less black, &quot;conjures up a deepemotional feeling among the brothers and sisters.&quot;   Not surprisingly, it does the same with Hispanics. Fornearly 10 years, Maria Acuna, a 30-year-old painter at thehospital, repeatedly tried to move up from temporary statusto a permanent position. But no luck. Finally last summer,she got her wish, but by now her anger is deep-seated.Latinos get short shrift in the department, she contends,&quot;even though they're making {blacks} permanent who have beenhere a year.&quot; (The hospital disputes this, noting that of the11 permanent members of the paint department, three areHispanic, seven are black and one is white.)   Fina Holcomb, a Hispanic who supervises Spanish-speakinginterpreters at the hospital, claims the broader problem atKing is favoritism. &quot;I've seen Hispanics not given theopportunities that other people have had,&quot; she says. &quot;Othershave brought in their own family and friends, whether theycan function or not. When they say it's a black hospital,damn right it's a black hospital.&quot;   That status -- as a black hospital -- was supposed to be apoint of pride. In the months following the Watts riots in1965, civic groups and government leaders looked for ways toprevent a similar conflagration from happening again. One oftheir conclusions was that the area in south Los Angelesneeded better health facilities that catered more to theneighborhood. Their proposals evolved into today's MartinLuther King Jr./Charles R. Drew Medical Center, one of fiveLos Angeles County hospitals. The facility includes a medicalschool and mental health center and has grown into a complexof several modern buildings amid manicured lawns and toweringpalms.   The hospital &quot;was a godsend for a lot of blacks in healthcare,&quot; says Ernest Smith, a longtime Watts activist. &quot;That'show we became 90% of the employment force.&quot; Blacks have ahistorical mandate to run the place, he says. &quot;The thing isself-determination.&quot;   The road has been rocky for King in recent years. A seriesof articles in the Los Angeles Times exposed serious problemsin the quality of medical care at the institution. Aregulatory body was even considering suspending King'saccreditation, but decided to put the hospital on probationinstead. Administrators and doctors there say the realproblem at King is its environment: a poor neighborhood rifewith crime and violence that saps resources and puts greatstress on the hospital's staff.   Joanne Williams, a 40-year-old black emergency caredoctor, says the hospital's patients -- roughly half of whomnow are Hispanic -- suffer disproportionately from prenatalproblems, communicable diseases and wounds from violence.&quot;The pathology there is incredible,&quot; she says. &quot;If it canhappen, you'll see it at King.&quot;   In September 1989, as problems worsened and charges ofhiring bias gathered steam, the county Department of HealthServices abruptly transferred William Delgardo, thehospital's popular black administrator, to a desk jobdowntown. It then replaced him with another blackadministrator, Edward Renford, formerly chief of staff in thehospital division of the county health service.   Mr. Delgardo says he was treated unfairly by thedepartment. King's environment put a severe strain on medicalservices, he argues. And as for discrimination, he says hecarefully followed the county's civil service rules.Hispanics were promoted &quot;when they qualified,&quot; he says.   Besides, claims Dr. Williams, while many of the Hispanicworkers at the hospital &quot;are sharp,&quot; a big portion of them&quot;don't aspire to do better.&quot;   That, of course, isn't the way the Hispanic employees seeit.   Raul Nunez, president of the Los Angeles County ChicanoEmployees Association, a labor organization, says King is anexample of the widely divergent treatment differentminorities get in the U.S. He has condemned King's hiringpractices and, in October 1989, stood before the county boardof supervisors to warn of &quot;the escalation of conflict&quot;between blacks and Hispanics at the medical center. Theproblems aren't recent ones, he says. A Los Angeles CountyHuman Relations Commission study of affirmative action atKing in 1984 found Hispanics were &quot;severely underutilized inall job classifications&quot; and that an &quot;extremely serious andpotentially explosive&quot; situation existed.   Following Mr. Nunez's appearance, the county board decidedto take a new look at the problems at King. It assignedRobert Arias, the county's affirmative action officer, toinvestigate King's hiring practices. s   Two months later, Mr. Arias produced a 73-page report. Itsconclusion: King's affirmative action goals weren't beingmet. &quot;The hospital's system, intentional or otherwise, ofrelegating Hispanics to semiskilled blue-collar type jobsbecause of their Spanish-speaking abilities, and failing totake measures to affirmatively hire and promote them tomiddle- and upper-level jobs, serves to exacerbate tensionsbetween ethnic minorities which already pervades theworkplace and community at large,&quot; it said.   Separately, the U.S. Equal Employment OpportunityCommission found &quot;reasonable cause to believe&quot; King wasviolating federal fair employment laws. This conclusion wasbased largely on the hospital's failure to produce records ofhiring and promotion practices, the EEOC said. (No Hispanicworkers have filed formal discrimination charges against thehospital, though they unanimously express their claims ofbias in interviews.)   About this time, race relations at the hospital weretaking a turn for the worse. Fliers appeared that contendedMr. Nunez was trying to change the medical center's name.Scores of black employees turned out in protest. Mr. Nunezsays he has no desire of the sort, and has sued the communitygroups listed on the flier as sponsors of the protest.   Mr. Arias has also paid a price for his report. &quot;I've hadmy tires slashed. A person who called me made it clear thathe knew my car and he was upset with what we were trying todo&quot; at the hospital, he says. Then, late last summer, DebryaMoore, Mr. Arias's black chief deputy, charged him with&quot;fostering racial animosity and divisiveness&quot; between blacksand Hispanics and keeping blacks out of the investigation ofbias at King. Mr. Arias denies the charges, which are stillbefore the county civil service commission. He concedes,however, that the investigation was carried out chiefly byhimself and his secretary; both are Hispanic. He adds thathis chief investigator, who is black, contributed to thereport, as did another staffer who is Native American.   Mr. Renford, the new administrator at King, meanwhile, gota taste of the hospital's problems his first day on the job.As he pulled up to the center, he found a group of blackdemonstrators protesting against his appointment and theremoval of Mr. Delgardo. Mr. Renford had to enter thehospital through a side door.   He quickly went to work to recast King's leadership. LastMay, he appointed a Hispanic chief operations officer for thehospital, and this year he named a Hispanic deputy directorof human resources. But recruiting Hispanics to work at theinner-city hospital isn't easy, says Mr. Renford. Not all ofthose who are qualified want to work at King. &quot;You have tounderstand that there is competition for qualifiedindividuals -- high demand but a limited resource,&quot; he says.   The new administrator has had his hands full putting downpersistent rumors that each time a Hispanic is hired orpromoted, a black loses out. The county's civil serviceguidelines protect current employees, but that doesn'treassure Clyde Johnson, president of the Black EmployeesAssociation, a county-wide organization. &quot;What's frighteningis when you have Nunez and the Chicano employees saying `wewant our fair share to come out of the black community.' Mymembers are saying we'd like to accommodate them. We don'tmind sharing the pie, but what happens to us?&quot;   Robert Gates, the county director of health services,agrees that King is &quot;a special case&quot; because of &quot;its verydifferent origin.&quot; But he also says the medical center can'tbe a static memorial to some bygone day. &quot;I think times arechanging and I think that hospital has to change with thetimes,&quot; he says. Black employees shouldn't worry &quot;about somewholesale shift of policy,&quot; Mr. Gates says. &quot;We're certainlyemphasizing an increased work force of Hispanics, but it isnot something that is going to happen overnight.&quot;   Most of the combatants in the dispute, including Mr.Nunez, believe people at the hospital aren't to blame for allof King's problems. Some of the friction is the fault of thecounty's Board of Supervisors, which ignores minorityinstitutions, they contend. Until this year, all of theboard's five supervisors were white, despite the huge growthof Los Angeles's minority population. In February, a Hispaniccity councilwoman became the first minority elected to theboard, representing a district in east Los Angeles. Notably,both black and Hispanic groups joined in the campaign to winher the post.   &quot;The tragedy is, in county government the representationof Latinos and African Americans is a disaster,&quot; says theUrban League's Mr. Mack. &quot;Neither of us has really gottenvery far.&quot;   Joseph Duff, president of the Los Angeles chapter of theNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People,contends that county officials have &quot;kept Martin Luther Kinghospital like a ghetto within the {hospital} system. It wassomething reserved for blacks and everybody played the game.&quot;He believes that the county doesn't care about new frictionsat the hospital and is inclined to ignore the center &quot;as longas you stay on the plantation and fight on the plantation.&quot;   Kenneth Hahn, the county supervisor who represents theWatts district, agrees that the hospital is &quot;low on thepriority list&quot; of his fellow supervisors. Mr. Hahn played abig role in getting King built and is generally popular amongWatts residents. He is quick to show visitors a photo in hisoffice of him shaking hands with Martin Luther King in 1961.And he is quick to blame the county board for neglecting themedical center.   But Mr. Hahn is also philosophical about the root of thehospital's current travails: the conflict between competingminorities. Relations between Hispanic and black workers atKing won't improve, he believes, until both groups &quot;realizethey are . . . all in one boat together.&quot; If the fight goeson, he says, the result is easy to predict. The hospitalbuilt to empower minorities will, in effect, &quot;be torn apart.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
