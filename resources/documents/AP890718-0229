Their decision Monday was a compromise between Britain's softerline and Italy's harder one.   Announcing the decision, the EEC vice president for foreignaffairs, Frans Andriessen, said the trade bloc would increase itsefforts to import U.S. certified, non-hormone-treated beef.   Andriessen reiterated the EEC criticism of what it views asunilateral U.S. action, both in the hormone dispute and in aconflict over EEC soybean imports.   ``We continue to contest unilateral actions taken by the U.S.,''he said.   Britain had proposed exempting ox-tongues, a popular food there,from the hormone ban. British officials said that could haverestored as much as $40 million of the $100 million a year the U.S.has estimated it is losing from the EEC ban.   That might have enabled the U.S. to reduce its retaliatory dutieson $100 million worth of EEC goods, British officials said.   But Andriessen said the 12 EEC foreign ministers decided againstthe British proposal because it would have required a change in EEClaws, and would have damaged the credibility of the ban on hormones.   An Italian proposal for the EEC to erect counter-measures againstthe U.S. retaliatory duties was also rejected as unwise, Andriessensaid.</TEXT></DOC>
