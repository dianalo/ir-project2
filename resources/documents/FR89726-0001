Regulatedareas are divided into high-risk areas and low-risk areas. Under the regulationsan area is designated as a high-risk area when an inspector determinesthat regulated articles exist within or adjacent to an area where defoliationhas occurred or where an inspector has reason to believe that 50 or moreegg masses per acre of the gypsy moth are present. Low-risk areas are thoseportions of regulated areas that are not designated as high-risk areas.Section 301.45-3 of the regulations imposes the following conditions onthe movement of regulated articles from gypsy moth regulated areas:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) A regulated article shall not be moved interstate from any high-riskarea into or through any nonregulated area unless a certificate or permithas been issued and attached to such regulated articles in accordance withandSection;andSection; 301.45-4 and 301.45-7.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(b) A regulated article shall not be moved interstate from any low-riskarea into or through any nonregulated area when it is determined by aninspector that any life stage of the gypsy moth is on the regulated article,and the person in possession thereof has been so notified by an inspector,unless a certificate or permit has been issued and attached to such articlesin accordance with andSection;andSection; 301.45-4 and 301.45-7.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(c) A regulated article originating outside of any high-risk area,except any regulated article in any low-risk area determined by an inspectorto present a hazard of spreading the gypsy moth pursuant to paragraph (b)of this section, may be moved interestate directly through any high-riskarea without a certificate or permit, if the point of origin of the articleis clearly indicated by shipping documents, their identity has been maintained,and they have been safeguarded against infestation while in any high-riskarea.</ITAG>Section 301.45-11 of the regulations imposes the following conditions onthe interstate movement of outdoor household articles from gypsy moth high-riskareas:<ITAG tagnum="21">(a) No outdoor household article shall be moved interstate from agypsy moth high-risk area into or through any nonregulated area unless;</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(1) Such outdoor household article is free from all life stages ofthe gypsy moth at the time of the interstate movement; or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(2) Such outdoor household article [OHA] is accompanied by an OHAdocument issued by a qualified certified applicator in accordance withthe provisions of andSection;andSection; 301.45-12 and 301.45-13 within fivecalendar days of the interstate movement from a gypsy moth high-risk area;or</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">(3) Such outdoor household articles are brought in by vacationersto the gypsy moth high-risk areas.</ITAG>These regulations are designed to restrict the interstate movement of regulatedarticles in those circumstances where there would be a significant riskof spread of gypsy moth. A certificate or limited permit is authorizedto be issued based on treatment of a regulated article or based on a determinationthat movement of a regulated article without treatment would not resultin the spread of the gypsy moth.<ITAG tagnum="85">Designation of Areas as Low-Risk Areas; Addition of North Carolinaas a Quarantined State</ITAG>We are amending andSection; 301.45-2a of the regulations by designating allor portions of Currituck and Dare Counties in North Carolina as gypsy mothlow-risk areas and amending andSection; 301.45(a) of the regulations by addingNorth Carolina to the list of quarantined states.Based on state and federal surveys, inspectors have determined that infestationsof gypsy moth occur in these areas designated as gypsy moth low-risk areas,but that the number of egg masses per acre is not high enough to meet thecriteria described below for gypsy moth high-risk areas.Restrictions concerning the gypsy moth are imposed on movements of regulatedarticles from gypsy moth low-risk areas only if it is determined by aninspector that any life stage of the gypsy moth is on the regulated article,and the person in possession thereof has been so notified by an inspector,unless a certificate or permit has been issued and attached to the regulatedarticle in accordance with andSection;andSection; 301.45 and 301.45-7 of theregulations. In this connection, it is necessary as an emergency measureto designate these areas as gypsy moth low-risk areas in order to advisepersons of the likelihood that inspectors would conduct inspections inthese areas and that, based on their findings of life stages of gypsy moth,restrictions could apply to the movement of regulated articles from theseareas.<ITAG tagnum="85">Removal of Area From List of Regulated Areas and Removal of StateFrom Quarantine</ITAG>We are amending andSection; 301.45-2a of the regulations by removing LaneCounty, Oregon, from the list of gypsy moth low-risk areas. The removalof Lane County, Oregon, from the list of gypsy moth regulated areas isto remove all areas in Oregon from the list of regulated areas. As a result,there is no longer a basis for quarantining Oregon. Therefore, we are removingOregon from the list of states quarantined because of gypsy moth in andSection;301.45(a).Based on treatments with insecticides and subsequent negative surveys inaccordance with the quarantine and regulations, it has been determinedthat the gypsy moth no longer occurs in the above-described area releasedfrom quarantine in Lane County, Oregon. Accordingly, there is no longera basis for continuing to list this area as a regulated area for the purposeof preventing the artificial spread interstate of gypsy moth. Therefore,as an emergency measure, it is necessary to remove this area from the listof regulated areas in order to delete unnecessary restrictions on the movementof gypsy moth regulated articles.<ITAG tagnum="85">Designation of Areas as High-Risk Areas: Addition of Utah as a QuarantinedState</ITAG>This document also amends andSection; 301.45-2a of the regulations by redesignatingall or portions of areas in Ashtabula, Geauga, Lake, and Trumbull Countiesin Ohio from gypsy moth low-risk to gypsy moth high risk areas; by designatingpreviously nonregulated areas in the City of Suffolk, and Charles City,Chesterfield, Essex, Franklin, Isle of Wight, James City, King and Queen,King William, New Kent, Prince George, Surry and Sussex Counties in Virginiaas gypsy moth high-risk areas; and by designating a portion of Salt LakeCounty in Utah as a gypsy moth high-risk area. Also, we are further amendingandSection; 301.45(a) of the regulations by adding Utah to the list of quarantinedstates.The specific areas affected, as discussed above, are set forth in the regulationportion of this document.Based on recent surveys, inspectors have determined, with respect to allof the areas added to the list of gypsy moth high-risk areas, that defoliationhas occurred in these areas because of the gypsy moth or that there isreason to believe that 50 or more egg masses per acre of the gypsy mothare present in these areas. Also, outdoor household articles and regulatedarticles exist within or adjacent to these areas. Accordingly, there isa substantial risk of artificially spreading the gypsy moth by unrestrictedinterstate movement of these articles. Therefore, as an emergency measure,it is necessary to designate these areas as gypsy moth high-risk areasand impose restrictions on the interstate movement of outdoor householdarticles and regulated articles from these areas in accordance with theregulations in order to prevent the artificial spread of the gypsy moth.<ITAG tagnum="84">Emergency Action</ITAG>James W. Glosser, Administrator of the Animal and Plant Health InspectionService, has determined that a situation exists that warrants publicationof this rule without prior opportunity for public comment. Because of thepossibility that the gypsy moth could be spread artificially to noninfestedareas of the United States and because it could cause economic loss dueto defoliation of susceptible forest areas, it is necessary to act immediatelyto control its spread. Also, where gypsy moth no longer occurs, or whenthere is reason to believe that the density of egg masses per acre hasdecreased sufficiently to remove the area from a gypsy moth high-risk orlow-risk area classification, immediate action is needed to remove unnecessaryrestrictions on the interstate movement of regulated articles.Since prior notice and other public procedures with respect to this interimrule are impracticable and contrary to the public interest under theseconditions, there is good cause under 5 U.S.C. 553 to make it effectiveupon publication. We will consider comments that are received within 60days of publication of this interim rule in the <T4>Federal Register.</T4> After the comment period closes, we will publishanother document in the <T4>Federal Register,</T4> including a discussion of any comments we receiveand any amendments we are making to the rule as a result of the comments.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12291 and Regulatory Flexibility Act</ITAG>We are issuing this rule in conformance with Executive Order 12291, andwe have determined it is not a ``major rule.'' Based on information compiledby the Department, we have determined that this rule will have an effecton the economy of less than $100 million; will not cause a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, state,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; and will not causea significant adverse effect on competition, employment, investment, productivity,innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to competewith foreign-based enterprises in domestic or export markets.For this action, the Office of Management and Budget has waived the reviewprocess required by Executive Order 12291.This action affects the interstate movement of regulated articles fromgypsy moth regulated areas in North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Utah and Virginia.For areas designated as high-risk areas, individual and commercial moversmoving outdoor household articles to areas outside the quarantined areamust determine that their articles are free of gypsy moth. Mobile homehaulers, loggers, nurserymen, and firewood haulers are required to obtaina certificate or limited permit from an inspector that their articles arefree of gypsy moth. For areas designated as low-risk areas, the same conditionsapply for movement of regulated articles when it is determined by an inspectorthat the movement of an article presents a hazard of spreading the gypsymoth. For areas determined to be free of gypsy moth and deregulated, norestrictions are imposed for movement of regulated articles.All regulated articles are inspected and certified without charge to thebusiness. A business not requesting this service in advance of shipmentmay be delayed in moving the product until service can be provided. A homeownermoving outdoor household articles from a high-risk area to an uninfestedarea may pay a qualified certified applicator (QCA) to inspect his goods.These charges average between $50-100. In some instances the company movingthat person reimburses the mover for their expense. Most QCA's are smallbusinesses. By declaring an area as a high-risk area the regulations mayincrease business for the QCA's located in high-risk areas. These businesseswill average $50 to $150 per month in additional income per business. Approximately153 new businesses will be trained to inspect outdoor household articlesand will offer this service to the general public. Based on informationcompiled by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, it has been determinedthat there are many hundreds of small entities that move regulated articlesinterstate from gypsy moth regulated areas and many thousands of smallentities that move regulated articles interstate from other states. However,based on such information, it has been determined that approximately 1,677small entities move regulated articles interstate from the specified areasaffected by this action.Under these circumstances, the Administrator of the Animal and Plant HealthInspection Service has determined that this action will not have a significanteconomic impact on a substantial number of small entities.<ITAG tagnum="84">Executive Order 12372</ITAG>This program/activity is listed in the Catalog of Federal Domestic Assistanceunder No. 10.025 and is subject to Executive Order 12372 which requiresintergovernmental consultation with state and local officials. (See 7 CFRPart 3015, Subpart V.)<ITAG tagnum="84">Paperwork Reduction Act</ITAG>This interim rule contains no information collection or recordkeeping requirementsunder the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>).<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 7 CFR Part 301</ITAG>Agricultural commodities, Plant pests, Plants (Agriculture), Quarantine,Transportation, Gypsy moth.Accordingly, 7 CFR Part 301 is amended as follows:<ITAG tagnum="52">PART 301_DOMESTIC QUARANTINE NOTICES</ITAG>1.
