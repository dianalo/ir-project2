Rebel leaders told a special Consultative Council of about 400delegates they had picked Mohammad Nabi Mohammadi as actingpresident and Ahmad Shah as acting prime minister of an interimgovernment.   The appointments were to be formally approved Sunday by thecouncil, but guerrilla officials said the vote was a formality.``The delegates have already made their feelings clear,'' saidguerrilla spokesman Mohammed Saeed.   Smiling delegates clustered around Mohammadi to shake his handand congratulate the resistance leader.   But officials of moderate guerrilla groups said they were nothappy, claiming hard-line fundamentalist groups had dominated thecouncil. They said some of their own delegates might vote ``no''Sunday or walk out in protest.   Guerrilla leaders and some Western diplomats predictAfghanistan's communist government will soon collapse in the wake ofWednesday's withdrawal of the last Soviet forces. A state ofemergency was declared in Afghanistan on Saturday.   However, the seven guerrilla parties based in Pakistan remaindeeply divided over sharing power. Many observers said the councilwas probably the guerrillas' last good opportunity to form a unitedfront and avoid a power struggle if they take control in Kabul.   Elections would be held in Afghanistan within six months to forman elected council, or shura, to appoint a permanent head of stateand ratify a government, officials said.   Guerrilla leaders said they would present their proposed interimministers on Sunday and ask the council to approve them. Thecouncil, which convened Feb. 10, was expected to conclude after thevote.   Party leaders said Saturday their Supreme Council, rather thanthe interim government, would remain the ultimate source ofauthority for the guerrilla alliance. Mohammadi, leader of one ofthe seven parties, was named head of the Supreme Council for eightmonths.   Sibghatullah Mojaddidi, one of the guerrilla party leaders,stepped down as acting head of the alliance to allow Mohammadi to beSupreme Council head in addition to interim president, officialssaid.   Four of the seven guerrilla parties are made up of hard-lineIslamic fundamentalists who want to establish a strictfundamentalist state in Afghanistan. The three moderate groups wanta more liberal state along the lines of the pre-communistgovernments.   The hard-line parties had pushed for appointment of Ahmad Shah aspresident, but they failed because of internal divisions. He wasprime minister of an interim government formed last year.   Ahmad Shah is a senior political official in Ittehad-i-Islamiguerrilla group.   Mohammadi heads one of the three moderate guerrilla parties,Harakat-i-Inquilab-i-Islami. He is widely respected as a politicaland religious leader, but his party has been weakened by chronicsplits and poor organization.   The choice of Mohammadi for acting president was seen as acompromise after the hard-line groups insisted on Ahmad Shah.   Mojaddidi, the former Supreme Ccouncil head, told a pressconference Saturday that moderates agreed to Ahmad Shah to preservethe guerrilla alliance.   The council apparently failed to resolve a dispute over seatingAfghan Shiite guerrilla groups based in Iran. A deal offering them100 council seats was rejected by the other party leaders. The sevenmain guerrilla groups are Sunni Moslem.</TEXT></DOC>
