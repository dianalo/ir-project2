President Bush is an outspoken opponent of Israeli settlementbuilding in the lands captured in the 1967 Middle East war. Heconsiders these enclaves to be a major obstacle to peace efforts.   Arens spoke in an Israel radio interview hours after hismotorcade was stoned in the West Bank town of Jericho, shattering awindow of the lead escort vehicle, Israeli reports said. Arens' carwas not hit.   In other developments Wednesday:   -A teen-age Palestinian girl was shot to death in the occupiedWest Bank when soldiers fired at Arab students throwing stones atIsraeli cars, Arab and Israeli reports said.   -The government barred prominent Palestinian activist SariNusseibeh of east Jerusalem from leaving the country for threemonths, noting unspecified security reasons, Israel TV reported.Nusseibeh has been mentioned in the past as a prospective peacenegotiator. Israel has accused him of playing a leadership role inthe 3-year-old uprising.   Arens said, ``Today there are 100,000 Jews in Judea andSamaria,'' using biblical names for the West Bank. He said this washigher than before the uprising began, without giving furtherfigures.   Previous estimates said about 70,000 Jews lived in the West Bankand Gaza Strip.   Settlement activity, Arens said, ``isn't being stopped by theintefadeh,'' the Arabic word for uprising. ``To the contrary it isblossoming ... and growing.''   The United States has conditioned $400 million in loans to buildhousing for Soviet immigrants on the homes not being built in theoccupied territories.   In Wednesday's fatal clash, about 200 students from the Arabvillage of Biddiya stoned Israeli cars on a highway in a protestmarking the anniversary of the founding of a radical PLO faction,Arab reports said.   Soldiers fired and one bullet struck Ahlam Abed in the head,killing her, the reports added.   Arab reports listed her age as 13, and said Jewish settlers alsofired guns during the confrontation. Israeli radio stations and TVsaid she was 16.   The army said it was investigating.   It brought to 778 the number of Palestinians killed by Israelisin the uprising. Fifty-four Israelis also have died. At least 316other Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs, most onsuspicion of helping Israel.
