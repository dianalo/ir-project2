<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-02-0443 </DOCNO><TEXT>We consider the problem of formulating a field theory of interacting closedstrings analogous to Witten's open-string field theory. Two natural candidateshave been suggested for an off-shell three-string interaction vertex:one scheme involves a cyclic geometric overlap in spacetime, while theother is obtained by 'stuttering' the Fock-space realization of the open-stringvertex. We demonstrate that these two approaches are in fact equivalent,utilizing the operator formalism as developed to describe Witten's theory.Implications of this result for the construction of closed-string theoriesare briefly discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
