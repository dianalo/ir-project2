The two provisions were added to the Pentagon budget bill andwere similar to restrictions added in each of the past two years bythe Democratic-controlled chamber in votes which split largelyalong party lines.   The White House had lobbied against both restrictions, as it hadin the past, and also opposes several other Democratic-backedprovisions scheduled to be considered by the chamber during thenext three weeks.   First the House voted 252-159 to ban any tests of Star Warsanti-missile defense systems which would violate the ``narrow''interpretation of the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty.   Then the chamber gave 240-174 approval to a ban on spending forany weapons that would violate the numerical restrictions onvarious types of atomic weapons that are contained in the 1979 SALTII treaty. President Reagan says the Soviets are violating theunratified treaty and he won't be guided any longer by itsrestrictions.   Rep. Duncan Hunter, R-Calif., opposed the amendments and toldDemocrats, ``Why you want to cripple Ronald Reagan three weeksbefore the summit is beyond me.''   Reagan will travel to Moscow on May 29 to meet with Sovietleader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. It will be the fourth time the twoleaders have met in the past three years.   Democrats responded to Hunter by noting that the limitations hadbeen added to past Pentagon budget bills and had not harmed armscontrol efforts.   ``This is the same kind of thing we've done before and therehasn't been a problem,'' said Rep. Norman Dicks, D-Wash., chiefsponsor of the SALT II provision.   The amendments were added to a bill authorizing $299.5 billionin Pentagon spending for the fiscal year that begins Oct 1. Thetotal is about the same as this year's defense budget and itresulted from last December's ``budget summit'' between Reagan andCongress which was designed to lower the federal budget deficit.   The bill that passes the House will have to be reconciled withthe separate measure which will be passed by the Senate. Thatchamber is moving more slowly on the Pentagon budget, which is nowbeing written by the Senate Armed Services Committee.   The ABM restriction arises from a three-year fight that has itsroots in Reagan's assertion that he has the legal authority tounilaterally change how the United States inteprets the 1972 pact.A ``broad'' interpretation would allow wide-scale tests of theStrategic Defense Initiative, the formal name of Reagan's Star Warsprogram.   But congressional Democrats have disputed Reagan's claim, andthe White House has not pressed the issue. None of the SDI testsscheduled for the next 18 months would violate the ``strict''interpretation.   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., called the restrictions ``unilateraldisarmament of a benign, but nonetheless serious, sort.''   But Rep. John Spratt, D-S.C., ``we're not doing anything morethan what the administration says it is doing.''   In another matter Wednesday, the House voted without dissent toname the Navy's next Trident ballistic submarine after the lateRep. Melvin Price, D-Ill., calling it a fitting tribute to thechampion of the nation's nuclear fleet.   Price, a 22-term congressional veteran, died Friday of cancer atage 83.   Price was chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for 10years. He also was a member of the defunct Joint Committee onAtomic Energy and was one of the chief congressional proponents ofdeveloping nuclear-powered submarines and surface ships.</TEXT></DOC>
