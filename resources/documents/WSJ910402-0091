Although the Schaumburg, Ill., electronics concern didn'tdisclose financial details, the partnership could meanhundreds of millions of dollars of revenue for Lockheed, andan important move into the commercial satellite business thecompany sorely wants to develop.</LP><TEXT>   Though the Calabasas, Calif.-based company said it hasbuilt a handful of commercial satellites, Iridium marks thefirst sizable nondefense satellite program.   The announcement also gives some momentum to Motorola andits unit in Chandler, Ariz., charged with pulling theambitious system together. The unit, Motorola SatelliteCommunications, has kept a low public profile sinceannouncing the planned $2.1 billion satellite system in June.   John Pemberton, a mobile communications analyst forGartner Group of Stamford, Conn., said that Motorola'ssilence has caused some in the U.S. to doubt the company'sability to make the system fly.   The system, which Motorola wants to have in service inearly 1997, would allow individuals anywhere on the globe tocommunicate by phone, filling gaps in the currentconventional telephone and cellular services.   The announcement ends a months-long search that tookMotorola to 17 companies, including aerospace concerns in theU.S., Europe and Japan. Bary Bertiger, assistant generalmanager of Motorola Satellite Communications, said Lockheedgot the green light because of its experience in buildingsmall, relatively complicated satellites and satellites thatuse a low orbit.   For Lockheed, which has revenue of about $10 billion ayear, the venture is more significant strategically thanfinancially.   &quot;It moves Lockheed in a new direction,&quot; said LawrenceHarris, aerospace analyst at Kemper Securities Group. &quot;Thiscould really place them in the forefront of commercialsatellite builders,&quot; along with General Motors Corp.'s HughesAircraft unit, TRW Inc., General Electric Co. and BritishAerospace.   Those companies, along with Martin Marietta Corp., Matraof France, McDonnell Douglas Corp., Boeing Co. are amongthose said to have competed for the Iridium work. Oneindustry official said the contest came down to Lockheed andBoeing, though a spokesman for Boeing said he knew only thathis company was one of four or five finalists. &quot;Like anybodyelse, we would have liked to have had the business,&quot; thespokesman said.   Lockheed, which signed the letter of intent through itsnewly formed Commercial Space Co. subsidiary, stressed thatit has only a preliminary agreement with Motorola and thatmany details are yet to be completed. Michael Brodsky,manager of Iridium program development for Lockheed'smissiles and space unit, said he expected that to takeseveral months.   Nor is the deal an automatic windfall. Motorola wants topool both the risks and rewards of building the satellites.Costs and any profits would be managed as one pool. &quot;Bothcompanies have to be successful for either to make money,&quot;Mr. Bertiger said.   The Motorola executive said the project is likely toinvolve hundreds of subcontractors, including some who lostout in the selection of Lockheed as the major partner.Several smaller subcontractors are already doing groundworkfor certain portions of the system.   Later this year, Motorola hopes to pick one or more launchcontractors to get the satellites into space. The companyalso must obtain regulatory approvals from governments aroundthe globe, and investors to own and operate the system.   The news of the Iridium selection comes at a good time forLockheed, which holds its annual meeting today. LockheedChairman Daniel Tellep has been trying to move his companyinto commercial markets that closely parallel its coremilitary lines. In the case of Iridium, &quot;We thought it was anabsolutely perfect fit,&quot; Mr. Brodsky said.   Still, for a company used to building one-of-a-kind spysatellites, the Hubble space telescope and the Milstarmilitary communications network -- a complex system designedto withstand a nuclear attack -- the higher-rate, lower-costcommercial production could be a challenge. Mr. Brodskynoted, however, that Lockheed's Agena satellite, which had awide range of uses, saw high-rate production from the late1950s through the 1970s.</TEXT></DOC>
