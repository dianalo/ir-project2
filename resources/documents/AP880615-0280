On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the July contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark U.S. crude oil, rose 40 centsTuesday to settle at $16.83 per barrel. The contract had dropped 90cents over the preceding three sessions, amid skepticism that thecartel would take any substantial steps to help boost prices.   Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasolinerose 1.02 cents a gallon to 49.53 cents and home heating oildeclined rose 0.57 cent to close at 44.32 cents a gallon.   Members of the 13-nation Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries ended their meeting in Vienna, Austria after agreeing toextend their existing production accord for six months.   Traders who sensed animosity among the various factions withinOPEC were relieved when the gathering concluded, said RichardRedoglia, a trader with Merrill Lynch Energy Futures.   ``The people were very, very nervous that these guys would comeout with a full-blown price war,'' Redoglia said. ``When that(animosity) abated, then the market was able to rally.''   OPEC's inability to come up with a new production agreement hadbeen digested by the market on Monday, analysts said.   The cartel has been divided into two main camps. The majority,led by Venezuela, wanted to cut production to boost prices closerto the target level. A minority, led by powerful Saudi Arabia,OPEC's largest producer, wanted to increase production to takeadvantage of a expected increase in demand during the rest of theyear and to maintain market share.   The agreement extended Tuesday calls for production quotas forthe 12 OPEC members other than Iraq totaling 15.06 million barrelsa day.   Iraq has refused to sign the accord because it wants a quotaequal to Iran's. The two countries have been at war since 1980.   Current OPEC production is estimated at 18.5 million barrels aday.</TEXT></DOC>
