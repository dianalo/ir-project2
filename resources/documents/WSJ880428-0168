In that sense it may be good news for South Korea's continuing democratization.    The failure of President Roh Tae Woo's Democratic Justice Party, or DJP, to win a majority means that for the first time the ruling party will have to compromise with the opposition -- and thus to edge away from some of the hard-line positions favored by its military supporters.    &quot;. . .Willingness to engage in dialogue and negotiation has become even more important if the administration and the ruling party are to carry out their policies smoothly,&quot; President Roh said in a statement conceding defeat.    At the same time, the opposition's unprecedented combined majority in the National Assembly is likely to accelerate its migration out of the streets and into the political system. Street demonstrations may not disappear, but they are likely to become rarer and less relevant. With the opposition in a position to enact its ideas into law, &quot;What do they have to protest about?&quot; asks a Western diplomat.    &quot;Our politics have been movement politics against military politics,&quot; says Chang Dal Joong of Seoul's Sogang University. &quot;Now we are incorporating these movement politics into party politics.&quot;    But Mr. Chang and other analysts also see troubling signs for democratization. Almost everyone deplores the regional antagonisms evident in the balloting, with much of the support for the three main opposition parties coming from each party leader's home territory.    Many experts foresee uncertain times as the government and the opposition adjust to the new political situation -- &quot;a rowdy period&quot; as one European diplomat puts it. The government, used to having its own way, isn't accustomed to having to negotiate; the opposition, unused to power, has never been forced to unify and come up with constructive policies.    Amid all the uncertainties, several things seem clear:   --The ruling DJP, which only a few weeks ago was hoping for the sort of secure majority enjoyed by Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, instead has a long-term political problem. Despite Mr. Roh's generally favorable public image, his party garnered only 33% of the popular vote. That was only slightly below the 36% vote that made Mr. Roh president in September and the 35% the DJP won in the National Assembly contest in 1985, but the three elections suggest that a solid two-thirds of the electorate favors the opposition.    That wasn't fatal to the DJP in the previous two elections, but this time, confident of prevailing once again against a divided opposition, it agreed to a rules change allowing only one candidate to be elected from each constituency. By coming in a close second in a number of districts, the ruling party was thus deprived of seats it might otherwise have won.    --The election results pose new challenges for U.S.-Korea relations. The government won't be as free to negotiate disputes over trade and other issues with the U.S. With nationalistic and anti-American sentiment on the rise, almost every point of contention between the two countries is likely to be aired publicly in the National Assembly, at times in provocative language. An American official says he doesn't &quot;necessarily think U.S.-Korea relations will suffer, but they will become a lot more public.&quot;    --The results can't help but have an impact on policy. While the National Assembly lacks the powers of legislatures in some other countries, it can no longer be disbanded at will by the president and it has a newly won right to investigate wrongdoing. It is likely there will be contentious investigations of scandals involving the family of Mr. Roh's predecessor, Chun Doo Hwan, and of the 1980 Kwangju massacre that helped consolidate Mr. Chun's hold on power. The opposition parties may also press for more local-government autonomy than the ruling party is prepared to give.    --Kim Dae Jung, the most militant of the opposition party leaders, is back again after having been written off only a few weeks ago. While his Party for Peace and Democracy, or PPD, won less of the vote than in the past, it took 70 seats in the National Assembly, overtaking Kim Young Sam's Reunification Democratic Party, or RDP, which has 59 seats. The ruling party has the most, 125 seats, but not a majority of the 299-seat Assembly.    Kim Jong Pil, the most conservative opposition leader and the closest ideologically to the ruling party, emerges from the election in a strong position. The 35 seats won by his New Democratic Republican Party, or NDRP, are enough in a coalition to give the ruling party a working majority. But Mr. Kim is a man of fierce pride -- &quot;A man who puts himself in a league with presidents and kings,&quot; says a Western diplomat -- and he isn't likely to form coalitions easily.    The seats in the assembly include 75 national-constituency places assigned proportionately according to the ballot results. The party with the most votes, in this case the ruling DJP, automatically gets one-third of the national constituency seats. In terms of actual seats won, the DJP took 87 local constituencies, Kim Dae Jung's PPD won 54, Kim Young Sam's RDP 46 and Kim Jong Pil's NDRP 27. Independents took 10 seats. </TEXT></DOC>
