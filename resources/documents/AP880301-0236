To Sell 473 7-Eleven Stores To Circle K</HEAD><BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Circle K Corp.'s agreement to buy 473 7-Elevenstores from Southland Corp. reflects the continuing strength of theconvenience store industry.   ``They've been growing rapidly,'' said Ian Bell, a retailanalyst with Merrill Lynch andamp; Co. Inc., of convenience stores,noting there are more than 70,000 such outlets across the country.   Southland decided to sell the 473 stores in 10 states to itschief competitor not because it's getting out of the business, butbecause it needs to raise more than $147 million to help financethe founding Thompson family's $4.9 billion leveraged buyout of thecompany in December.   Southland plans to keep selling stores until it has between7,000 and 7,300 by the end of 1989, said spokeswoman MarkeetaMcNatt. The company will have 7,542 stores after the Circle Ktransaction, down from the 8,296 it held before beginning itsdivestiture plan.   Despite the sales, Southland will remain the largest conveniencestore operator in the country and the world.   ``We have such a solid name now that we do not feel that namerecognition is a problem,'' Ms. McNatt said. ``We are firmlyplanted in the minds of Americans as the convenience store people.''   Southland's plans fit right in with Circle K's desire to expand.The Phoenix-based convenience store operator has been growing byleaps and bounds in recent years and the latest acquisition willgive it just over 4,000 outlets in 25 states.   Susan Plumb, a spokeswoman for Circle K, said the company waslooking to continue its expansion and hoped to have a total of5,000 stores by 1990. The company is negotiating the purchase ofanother 500 stores in the South and Northeast from the Charter Co.,she said.   The 7-Eleven stores will be converted to the Circle K name, shesaid.   The $147 million purchase price for the 473 7-Eleven storesincludes real estate and other assets, and Circle K will pay anadditional amount for store inventories, Southland President JereW. Thompson said.   Included in the sale are all of Southland's convenience storesin Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Louisiana and South Carolina, Ms.McNatt said.   The proposed transaction, subject to a definitive agreement andgovernment approval, also includes 63 stores in North Carolina;three in Yuma, Ariz.; 18 in Nashville, Tenn.; 57 stores in smallTexas markets; and 23 stores in the Florida Panhandle.   Many of the stores also sell gasoline, which further increasestheir attractiveness, said Bell.   Convenience stores are successful because they give consumers aplace to buy quickly one or two items, such as coffee or cigarettes.   Bell said the stores also have been successful because they tendto be innovative, offering automatic cash machines and videocassette rentals to increase their main attraction _ convenience.   Southland's $4.9 billion leveraged buyout took the chain privateand cemented the control of the founding Thompson family.   In a leveraged buyout, investors use mostly borrowed funds toacquire a company. The debt is repaid with the target company'scash flow or with money raised by selling its assets.   Southland already has sold 270 7-Eleven stores to NationalConvenience Stores, the third-largest convenience store operatorwith about 1,170 outlets.   Southland also has announced definitive agreements for thedivestiture of its Chief Auto Parts, Dairies Group, Tidel Systemsand MovieQuik videocassette rental operations.   The company also plans to divest its Reddy Ice, Snack Foods andChemical-Food Labs divisions.</TEXT></DOC>
