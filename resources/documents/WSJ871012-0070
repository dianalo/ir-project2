Officials at MBB, a 37.9% shareholder in the European jetliner consortium Airbus Industrie, weren't available for comment.    A spokesman for Amsterdam-based Fokker stressed that &quot;this is by no means a merger.&quot; Fokker and MBB already have some ties. Munich-based MBB builds large fusillage sections for Fokker's new F-100 twinjet and produces a small part of Fokker's F-50 turbo prop airplane. Fokker is a subcontractor on two Airbus models in which MBB is a major participant, and is considering a small workshare in Airbus's new A-330 and A-340 programs.    Closer cooperation between MBB and Fokker comes at a time when both companies are suffering tough financial sledding. MBB, which is 42.5%-owned by the German states of Bavaria, Hamburg and Bremen, had a loss of 103.7 million West German marks ($57.2 million) in 1986. It expects a deficit this year of about 95 million marks.    Fokker had a loss of 3.4 million guilders ($1.7 million) in the first half of the year. The publicly traded company expects to post a small loss for the full year. </TEXT></DOC>
