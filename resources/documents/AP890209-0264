In a move that could be viewed as violating his ``no-new-taxes''pledge, the president also recommended an extension of the 3 percenttax on telephone service, which is due to expire at the end of 1990,and to eliminate a scheduled reduction in taxes on airline ticketsand cargo.   He also proposed a $2-billion-a-year tax cut for corporateresearch costs; a Social Security tax increase of about the samesize on 2 million employees of state and local governments; and newtax incentives for the oil industry and for parents who adopt.   Bush, in his outline for ``Building a Better America,'' endorsedmost of the miscellaneous revenue measures that then-PresidentReagan sent to Congress last month. But the new president apparentlyabandoned a Reagan proposal that would have had the Internal RevenueService charge taxpayers a fee when they call for advice on fillingout their tax returns.   By far the hottest issue in the revenue package is the proposalto cut the capital-gains tax. Bush added fuel to this long-runningdebate by claiming that his proposal would not cost the treasury adime but would, in fact, raise more than $16 billion over the nextfive years, but lose $20.1 billion the following three years.   ``Restoring the capital-gains differential will increaseentrepreneurial activity and employment, paving the way fordiscoveries of new products, processes, and whole new industries,''Bush said.   Rep. Dan Rostenkowski, D-Ill., chairman of the tax-writing HouseWays and Means Committee, vowed all-out opposition to acapital-gains cut.   ``I'm not about to tell the wage earners in Chicago that theyshould pay a higher tax than stockbrokers,'' Rostenkowski told theNational Press Club. ``I personally will strongly resist any effortsto undo (the 1986) tax reform, including the return to apreferential tax rate for capital gains.''   Capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stock, realestate and other assets, traditionally were taxed at lower ratesthan wages and other income, under the assumption that most suchinvestments are good for the economy. Congress repealed thatpreferential treatment in 1986 as part of the price of reducingindividual tax rates in the landmark tax overhaul.   Thus, capital gains and wages now are taxed the same: at rates of15 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent.   Bush proposed to phase in a new capital-gains preference thatwould produce a maximum rate of 15 percent on most gains; for thoseat the lower end of the income scale, the rate would be 8.25percent. Coins, paintings and other collectibles would not qualifyfor the preference.   In general, couples with incomes under $20,000 and single peopleunder $10,000 would pay no tax on any qualified capital gain.   IRS estimates from returns filed in 1987 _ the last year forwhich complete figures are available _ show that taxable capitalgains of $135 billion were reported on 12.9 million of the 103million returns filed that year.   More than one-third of that gain was recorded by only 34,818taxpayers with incomes over $1 million a year. Their gain: $46.5billion. The 1.15 million taxpayers with incomes over $100,000 had70 percent _ $95 billion _ of the gain. About 3.7 million taxpayerswith incomes under $20,000 had less than 7 percent of the gain.   Other Bush revenue proposals:   _Make permanent the 3 percent tax on local and long-distancetelephone service, which otherwise would expire Dec. 31, 1990. Thiswould cost taxpayers $6 billion in the following three years.   _Authorize a new tax credit of up to $1,000 a year for each childunder age 4 in an estimated 2.5 million working families withincomes under $13,000. The credit, designed to assist withchild-care expenses, would be available even if the family owes notax. The family could choose between this credit and the existingdependent-care credit, which can be worth up to $1,440 a year.   _Require 2 million state and local government workers hired afterMarch 31, 1986, to pay a tax for Medicare coverage. Many already areeligible for Medicare because of a prior job or a working spouse.The tax, collected as part of the Social Security levy, is 1.45percent of the first $48,000 of annual earnings.   _Retain the full federal tax on airline tickets, air cargo andaviation fuel. A new law would cut them by half next year becauseCongress contends the government is not spending the money quicklyenough for airport and airway improvements.   _Give the oil and gas industry tax credits for the first $10million of expenditures each year on such intangible oil-drillingexpenses as labor and pipe, and for spending required to usesophisticated ``tertiary'' techniques to produce oil. Rules thathinder the sale of proven oil properties to independent producerswould be repealed. Independent producers would be allowed to deductfrom the minimum tax 80 percent of certain exploratory intangibledrilling costs.   _Permit a deduction of up to $3,000 for expenses of adopting achild with special needs, such as a physical handicap.   _Make permanent a 20 percent credit for increased corporatespending for research, and permit international corporations todeduct 67 percent of total research spending against domestic income.   _Give businesses $1 billion worth of tax incentives over fouryears for locating in economically distressed areas.</TEXT></DOC>
