FU</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>NANKING, China (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Evangelist Billy Graham said today thatthe Christian church in the United States has been ``cleansed andjudged'' as a result of scandals involving television evangelists.   ``Many of the clergymen are being certain that they haveintegrity in a way they didn't a couple of years ago,'' said he69-year-old Southern Baptist minister, who is on a 16-day tour ofChina.   Television evangelist Jimmy Swaggart was defrocked by theAssemblies of God Church this month after he confessed tounspecified sins against the church and his family. A prostitutehas said Swaggart paid her to pose nude for him.   Jim Bakker, former head of the PTL television empire, resignedlast year in a sex scandal involving church secretary Jessica Hahn.   ``I think the church has been, in a sense, helped by all thisbecause it's been cleansed and judged,'' Graham said in answer toan American student's question at the Nanking University-JohnsHopkins Center for Chinese and American Studies.   He spoke during a question-and-answer session after addressing150 American and Chinese students and faculty at the center, whichthe two schools opened in October 1986.   Graham said the scandals will not destroy the Christian churchin the United States.   ``The church will always be there,'' he said. ``(It) is newswhen you have religion and sex and money all mixed up, but that'snot the story of the regular churchgoer.''   Graham, who arrived in Nanking on Wednesday evening, spoke fornearly an hour on the role of religion in American society.   Afterwards, Graham visited the Amity Printing Press, the onlyprinting plant in China that prints mainly the Bible and otherreligious material.   The plant, on the outskirts of Nanking, opened in December andis expected to print at least 600,000 Bibles this year. Ninetypercent of the facility's printing time is devoted to the Bible,which is sold at most Christian churches for about $1.90.   Graham has preached in more than 60 countries, including theSoviet Union. This is his first visit to China.   His wife, Ruth, was born and spent the first 17 years of herlife in east China's Jiangsu province, where her father was amissionary surgeon.   On Wednesday, the couple visited Mrs. Graham's birthplace inHuaiyin on the banks of the Grand Canal, the longest man-madewaterway in the world.   In Beijing, the evangelist met with Premier Li Peng and preachedin a Chinese church.   Graham is to speak to students at the Nanking TheologicalSeminary, China's largest theological training center, on Fridaybefore going to Shanghai, where he is to preach again.   He plans to visit Canton before leaving China on April 28.</TEXT></DOC>
