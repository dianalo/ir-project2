In no time at all, the city was resonating with the freshlystarched snap of virgin currency.;    In some parts of this water- andpower-starved place, it was banking by candlelight as savings accounts werefinally cracked open, unleashing a flood of red, green and orange dinars intoa marketplace with no real money.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Front  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  HAPPY KUWAITIS RUSH TO BANKS AS DOORS REOPEN  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  TURMOIL IN THE MIDEASTSee also related stories on pages 1A and 5-6A of this section.  </MEMO><TEXT>     Gone were the Iraqi dinars that had been pumped into the economy for muchof the seven-month occupation. Also put out to financial pasture were any ofthe old Kuwaiti dinars -- KDs for short -- that the Iraqis had looted from theCentral Bank and injected into the market. Serial numbers of the canceled KDswere posted everywhere.;    And like bettors poring over tip sheets at thetrack, Kuwaitis spent half their time studying scraps of paper listing thenow-worthless numbers.;    Excitement filled the air as banks geared up forthe 10 a.m. launch, suggesting that a country without its own money is acountry with an identity crisis. Many Kuwaitis welcomed the arrival of the newbills with the breathless anticipation of spring.;    &quot;This means a new lifefor us,&quot; said Younis al-Yasis, 32, a Kuwaiti judge waiting outside thecandlelighted Hawally branch of al-Ahli Bank. &quot;With this money, the nightmareof the Iraqi invasion will be gone forever. Freedom has returned.&quot;;    Formany, the freedom of money meant the freedom to move. Several peopleinterviewed in bank lines said that once they had cash in hand, they weremaking a beeline for the nearest border.;    &quot;For seven months, we've had notravel, just bombs,&quot; said Yousef al-Shatti, 30, a cargo handler for KuwaitAirways. &quot;We've been stuck here. Even our children stayed every day inside thehouse. That can make you crazy.;    &quot;I want to go to Bahrain and Cairo now. Ijust want to be a tourist for a while.&quot;;    The introduction of 700 millionKuwaiti dinars -- at an exchange rate of $3.48 each, they were worth about$2.4 billion -- was announced last week by Sheik Salem Abdulaziz al-Sabah,governor of the Central Bank. Trying to stimulate a devastated and moribundeconomy, the government promised Kuwaitis that they would find their postwarbank account balances at the level they were at on Aug. 1, the day before theinvasion.;    In addition, each Kuwaiti national who remained during theoccupation would receive an emergency grant of 500 dinars (about $1,700). Themoney would be deposited directly into their accounts to tide them over duringthe crisis.;    The fact that non-Kuwaitis, including the country's sizablePalestinian population, will not receive the emergency grant added one moredollop of resentment along the bank lines Sunday.;    &quot;We are all Muslims,&quot;said Jamal Moustafa, 27, a Palestinian teacher. &quot;Everyone should get it. Weall sat here for seven months of hell. Why should just the Kuwaitis whoremained get that money?&quot;;    Behind the counters at the 52 bank branches openfor business Sunday, harried tellers licked their thumbs and peeled off billafter bill, each still smelling of ink.;    &quot;Because there are no phones, wecan't yet hook up with our main computers,&quot; said Abdul Hady Kout, manager ofthe Jabriya branch of the National Bank of Kuwait. &quot;So the tellers must writedown every transaction.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  PATRICK MAY, Knight-Ridder News Service  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Kuwait City  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910325  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  5A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  593  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 25, 199100085095,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
