Chipello   Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>05/16/91</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A12</SO><RE>JAPAN (JA)</RE><LP>   TOKYO -- The first woman to head a major Japanesepolitical party may soon surrender her post.   Takako Doi, heralded just two years ago as the symbol of anew age in Japanese politics, hinted that she is prepared tostep down at a Socialist Party convention in July. Rumorsthat she might resign as chairman of the largest oppositionparty have been circulating in the wake of the party's heavylosses in last month's local elections and its dismal showingin opinion polls.</LP><TEXT>   The reports of Ms. Doi's likely departure came on the sameday as the death of Shintaro Abe, a leading figure in theruling Liberal Democratic Party. Mr. Abe's death at the ageof 67, following a long illness, is certain to set offjockeying for power among LDP factions. That could influencethe party's leadership contest in October. The LDP's majorityin the lower house of the Diet, or parliament, means that itsleader becomes Japan's prime minister.   Mr. Abe was one of several party elders whose aspirationsto become prime minister were derailed by aninfluence-peddling scandal two years ago. Some of the others,including former Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and formerFinance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, appear to be positioningthemselves for a possible turn in the top office once PrimeMinister Toshiki Kaifu's term ends in October. Mr. Abe'sfaction could switch its loyalties to other factions,affecting the party's power balance.   As is often the case in Japanese politics, Ms. Doi'sremarks were exceedingly oblique: She talked of her desire,for example, to &quot;renew the spirits&quot; of the party membership.But her comments were widely interpreted as signaling herintention to step down after five years at the party helm.   Ms. Doi, a 62-year-old former law professor, took officeat a time when the Socialists were floundering. She quicklycaught the public's fancy with her tough-toned speeches andcharisma, which is unusual for a Japanese politician. Withthe LDP battered by scandal and its passage of an unpopularconsumption tax, she led the Socialists to big gains in the1989 and 1990 Diet elections, sparking speculation that theperennial opposition party could even gain a share of power.   But the Socialists' inability to break free of theirMarxist roots and adopt policies more in tune with mainstreamJapanese attitudes disillusioned many who had hoped Ms. Doiwould lead the party into a new era. Meanwhile, the LDP'srising support ratings and its development of closer ties tomoderate opposition parties have threatened to leave theSocialists weaker and more isolated than ever.</TEXT></DOC>
