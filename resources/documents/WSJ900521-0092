Congress has defied the president on a variety offoreign-policy issues in recent weeks. Lawmakers tied downhis request for &quot;emergency&quot; aid for Panama and Nicaragua, andthey forced the administration to cut military aid to ElSalvador.</LP><TEXT>   The Senate declared that Mr. Bush shouldn't even botherasking Congress to ratify a trade treaty with the SovietUnion if the Kremlin continues to strong-arm Lithuania.Congress also displeased the White House by saying itrecognizes Jerusalem as Israel's capital. And lawmakers aremoving on their own to impose sanctions against Iraq'sstrongman, Saddam Hussein.   &quot;A lot of us think there's no political loss tochallenging the president on these issues, because theAmerican people don't support him,&quot; says Rep. Howard Berman(D., Calif.), a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committeewho has led the drive for sanctions on Iraq.   To some extent, such stands represent normalcongressional-White House jousting over control of foreignpolicy. But they are a far cry from what the president andhis aides had counted on after Mr. Bush, in the first bigpower test of 1990, was sustained on his controversial vetoof a bill that would have guaranteed Chinese students havenin the U.S. The president, against the counsel of some of hisadvisers, fought to get that veto upheld in hopes ofconvincing lawmakers that he had the muscle to win suchdisputes.   Now it appears that Mr. Bush's stand on China may bebackfiring. After persuading Congress to let him handle U.S.reaction to China's crackdown on pro-democracy students, Mr.Bush has failed with his soft-spoken approach to persuadeChina's leaders to loosen up. That sour outcome hasemboldened lawmakers to challenge the president on otherissues. And Mr. Bush's apparent decision to seek a renewal ofChina's most-favored-nation trade status may cause morebickering.   This suggests Mr. Bush may encounter bumps in the road ashe tries to nail down agreements changing the U.S.-Sovietrelationship and repositioning the U.S. to deal with arevamped Europe.   There is broad congressional support for relaxing tensionswith the Soviets, and lawmakers are certain to favor newarms-cutting pacts. But the Senate warning on the Soviettrade treaty suggests that congressional sympathy for theBaltic republics' attempts to break away from the Kremlin'sgrip could complicate administration efforts to strikeeconomic agreements with Moscow.   Many lawmakers think the trade treaty, for instance, wouldmainly benefit the Soviets; as a result, it gives the U.S.leverage that &quot;we need to use,&quot; says Sen. Richard Lugar (R.,Ind.), one of the president's strongest congressional allieson foreign policy. The administration already is bending tothis sentiment, signaling it may drop plans to sign the tradetreaty at the May 31 U.S.-Soviet summit.   Since Mr. Bush took office, he has preached that Congressshould keep its nose out of presidential foreign-policydecisions. That blunt stand may be adding to the president'sproblems by producing a backlash among lawmakers who want todemonstrate they won't meekly defer to the president onforeign policy.   &quot;There's a new school of presidential prerogatives, and Idon't like it one damn bit,&quot; says Sen. Daniel Moynihan, a NewYork Democrat. He sparked a confrontation with the WhiteHouse by pushing an amendment to make it a criminal offensefor executive-branch officials to solicit money for, ordivert money to, activities for which direct U.S. foreign aidis prohibited. The amendment is designed to prevent a repeatof the Iran-Contra affair. Sen. Moynihan agreed to withdrawhis amendment after Mr. Bush cited it as one reason forkilling a State Department spending bill, but the lawmakerpledges to raise it again.   The administration also suffers because its acknowledgedmaster at stroking Congress on foreign policy, Secretary ofState James Baker, is preoccupied dealing with changessweeping over Eastern Europe.   A bigger problem for Mr. Bush is a feeling, sometimesuniting Democratic liberals and Republican conservatives,that the president is too worried about the stability ofexisting regimes in places such as Moscow and Beijing andtherefore too reticent to criticize their actions.   &quot;My guess is that my colleagues feel that in manyinstances the president is showing an excess of tolerance&quot;for such regimes, says Rep. Berman. &quot;Basically, I think theAmerican people like the idea of an American foreign policyguided by a principle, and the principle is to encouragedemocracy and human rights.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
