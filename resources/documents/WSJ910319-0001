Treasury Undersecretary Robert Glauber said in a letter toWilliam Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit InsuranceCorp., that the administration agreed to a plan unveiled byMr. Seidman earlier this month, which would grant the FDICthe authority to borrow up to $25 billion from the FederalReserve Banks.</LP><TEXT>   The borrowings would be repaid through increases in theinsurance premiums that banks pay to the FDIC. In the letter,Mr. Glauber said the FDIC will pay interest on the borrowingsat a rate equal to the Treasury rate for borrowings ofcomparable maturity. The Fed loans wouldn't affectbudget-deficit calculations.   Previously, it wasn't clear whether a refinancing planwould be included in the bank legislation. The bank insurancefund, at its lowest level in history as a percentage of thedeposits it protects, needs recapitalization. Such aprovision could act as an engine to pull along other, morecontroversial, parts of the legislation, such as a plan toallow industrial companies to own banks and to allow banks toengage in securities underwriting.   The legislation, which is expected to be delivered toCapitol Hill at midweek, would cap the FDIC premiums at 30cents per $100 of deposits. Currently, the FDIC has unlimitedauthority for assessing premiums. Premiums are expected torise to 23 cents per $100 on July 1 from 19.5 cents.   The recapitalization plan has already received a warmwelcome in Congress, because it would bolster the fundwithout requiring direct taxpayer aid.</TEXT></DOC>
