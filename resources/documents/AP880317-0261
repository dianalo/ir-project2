Buoyed by Wednesday's report of an increase in Canada's foreigntrade surplus, the Canadian currency was quoted as high as 80.08U.S. cents in mid-morning trading on foreign exchange markets.   The Canadian dollar last traded above 80 U.S. cents on Feb. 24,1984. It is now more than 10 cents above its all-time low of 69.13U.S. cents recorded in February 1986.

The trend is good news for Canadians who buy goods imported fromthe United States and who travel south of the border. But it is badnews for Canadian manufacturers, who send 80 percent of theirexports to the United States.</TEXT></DOC>
