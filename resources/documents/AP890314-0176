Police said 96 people were wounded in the worst fighting since1985 in Lebanon's 14-year-old sectarian civil war, and most of thecasualties were in Moslem west Beirut. They said two children andthree Syrian soldiers were among the dead and four Lebanese soldierswere wounded.   The day-long battle between Christian forces and Walid Jumblatt'sDruse militia began as people were going to work, catching them bysurprise, and shells blasted cars to bits during rush hour.   Schools sent children home. Merchants in the city's Moslem andChristian sectors slammed down their shutters. Radios blaredwarnings to stay indoors.   ``It's moronic. They are the gardeners of violence,'' FatimaHaidar, a teacher of English, said through the sound of artilleryfire while closing her secondary school in Moslem west Beirut'sVerdun district.   ``May God chop off the hands of all leaders on both sides of thecapital! They are butchers!'' said a Sunni Moslem woman who gave hername only as Fatima.   Ships left port for open water. Aircraft flew to Cyprus to escapeshelling at the airport.   Fighting began March 8, two days after Aoun impose a blockade onillegal ports run by Moslem militias. Police gave total casualtiessince as 45 dead and 128 wounded.   The confrontation threatens efforts of Arab League mediators toresolve a political crisis that created Christian and Moslemgovernments and has split the army into sectarian commands.   Gen. Michel Aoun, who leads a Christian military cabinet andcommands the 20,000 Christian troopers, said Tuesday: ``It's a warof liberation against Syrian occupation forces. The battle hasbegun.''   Syria supports the Moslem government of Prime Minister SalimHoss. The Syrians have 40,000 soldiers in Lebanon, including Beirut,and President Hafez Assad has become the nation's main power brokerin the chaos of civil war.   In midafternoon, police said, Aoun's forces shelled the bordertown of Chtaura, command headquarters for Syrian troops in eastLebanon's Bekaa Valley, and cut the Damascus-Beirut highway.   Gen. Sami Khatib, chosen by Hoss to command the army's 22,000Moslem soldiers, has kept out of the Christian-Druse battle. Histroops are poorly equipped and scattered throughout Lebanon's Moslemterritory, which generally covers west and south Beirut, southLebanon and coastal areas.   Aoun accused the Syrians of starting the artillery duels betweenhis and Jumblatt's men Tuesday by shelling both Moslem and Christianneighborhoods.   In Damascus, the official daily Al-Baath said Aoun's accusationswere false, aimed aimed at ``devastating Syria's constructive rolein Lebanon.''   Syrian sources said privately Aoun wanted to draw Syrian troopsinto the fight but Assad did not want an armed clash.   Speaking to reporters at the presidential palace at suburbanBaabda, in Christian territory five miles northeast of Beirut, Gen.Aoun said: ``My government has decided to take all the necessarymeasures to force the Syrian army to withdraw from Lebanon.''   He said he asked the Arab League and its mediation committee to``intervene at once to ensure the withdrawal of the Syrianoccupation army.''   ``Lebanon cannot possibly stay on under the mercy of the Syriancannon,'' he said at the news conference, broadcast by Christianradio and television stations.   His office at the Defense Ministry, near the palace, was hit byartillery fire. The television station run by Aoun's Christiangovernment said Syria fired on the ministry just before the newsconference in an attempt to ``assassinate him.''   It showed Aoun's desk, which appeared demolished, and leatherchairs and metal filing cabinets covered with the rubble ofchandeliers and walls. Aoun was shown inspecting the wreckage andsaid: ``It's not by chance that the office was shelled. Syria is aterrorist country.''   A howitzer salvo landed in a crowded street of west Beirut,setting seven cars afire, said Associated Press photographer AliMohammed.   ``The charred body of one motorist was pulled by rescuers fromone car as pedestrians sprinted in panic for cover,'' he said.   Dozens of smoldering cars littered the Aishe Bakkar, Mossaitbeh,Noweiry and Ein Mreisseh districts of west Beirut and theAshrafiyeh, Dora, Hazmieh and Bourj Hammoud neighborhoods of theChristian east, police said.   A shell landed near a bakery where a line of people waited to buybread 200 yards from the prime minister's home. Another demolished asandwich kiosk outside a seaside restaurant in west Beirut's Rouchedistrict, a few yards from a Syrian army checkpoint.   Several rounds struck near the Middle East Hospital, close to theheadquarters of the 12,000 Syrian soldiers who have taken charge ofsecurity in west Beirut and the Shiite Moslem southern slums.   Hoss accused Christian army gunners of shelling crowdedintersections in west Beirut and called for an end to ``thisshameful massacre, this new cycle of mad violence.''   Police said shells hit the Beirut port; the Christian harbor ofJounieh, 12 miles north of the capital, and the airport, whichopened Monday after a two-day closure because of the fighting.   President Amin Gemayel chose Aoun to lead the government when hisown six-year term expired in September and conservative Christianswould not accept Syria's nominees to succeed him. Moslems thenpledged allegiance to Hoss.   By tradition, Lebanon's president is Christian, the primeminister Sunni Moslem and the parliament speaker a Shiite Moslem.</TEXT></DOC>
