The weekly Expresso said the troops were attacked while settingup one of the posts designed to monitor an Aug. 8 cease-fire betweenAngola and South Africa along the border.   The paper said its information was first-hand from Luanda butnamed no sources.   Following the attack, Angola ``established intense diplomaticcontacts'' with South Africa to find out the cause of the incident,but Pretoria denied its forces were involved, Expresso said.   The rebel National Union for the Total Independence of Angolaalso has not claimed responsibility for the attack in its regularstatements issued in Lisbon.   Angolan officials have accused South Africa of continuing tosupply the rebels through the unpatrolled border section.   Pretoria claims the area allows activists of the South WestAfrican People's Organization to slip in and out of Namibia.   The Angolan rebels have their main Jamba base about 19 miles fromthe Namibian border and claim control of the region.   They have warned repeatedly that hostile forces found in thearea, including members of a 10-nation, U.N. monitoring force, wouldbe attacked.   Angolan military officials have said they would have to send anarmed contingent into the unpatrolled area to oust the rebels, butthat would allow South Africa to accuse them of violating thecease-fire agreement.   The agreement states there can be no substantial troop movementson either side of the border.   Expresso did not say whether the attacked troops formed part of amilitary operation against the Angolan rebels.   Under accords signed Dec. 22 in New York by Angola, Cuba andSouth Africa, Pretoria pledged to cease aid to the Angolan rebelsand to give independence to Namibia.   In return, Angola promised to end support to African nationalistactivists and Cuba agreed to withdraw 50,000 troops that supportedAngola's Marxist government in its fight against the rebels.</TEXT></DOC>
