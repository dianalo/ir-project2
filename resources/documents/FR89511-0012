Wells, Air Programs Branch,Environmental Protection Agency, One Denver Place, Suite 500, 999 18thStreet, Denver, Colorado 80202-2405, (303) 294-1773, (FTS) 564-1773.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: </T2><ITAG tagnum="84">Background</ITAG>On December 8, 1987, the United States and the Soviet Union signed theIntermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty to eliminate intermediate-rangeand shorter-range Pershing missile systems. The treaty provides specificmethods, procedures, and timeframes for destroying the missiles once thetreaty enters into force.The Army completed an Environmental Assessment (EA) in February 1988, pursuantto the provisions of the National Environmental Policy Act, on the potentialenvironmental effects of eliminating the missiles. The EA was submittedto the United States Senate for information during the treaty ratificationprocess. The EA discussed destruction methods of static firing and openburning in the State of Colorado. The document concludes with a findingof no significant impact but points out the need for environmental permits.Pueblo Army Depot Activity is the only site evaluated in the EA for theelimination process in Colorado.To ensure compliance with the mandates of the treaty and state and federalenvironmental regulations, the Army has been consulting with the Officeof the Governor, the State Department of Health, and the EPA. During meetingsof April 6-7, 1988, with Colorado Department of Health officials, the Armywas advised to submit a rulemaking petition to exempt the Pershing eliminationactivity from the state opacity limit for the reason stated below:<ITAG tagnum="21">Air emissions from the static firing of Pershing rocket motors areemitted directly into the ambient air and therefore cannot be mitigated.</ITAG>The amended Regulation No. 1, Section II.A.9 (new section) would exemptemissions from the static firing of missiles at Pueblo Army Depot Activityfor a period not to exceed 36 months from the first day of missile destructionunless otherwise mandated by amendment to the treaty or the state air permit.In accordance with the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty as ratified,the Pueblo Army Depot submitted an application for an air pollution emissionpermit to dispose of Pershing rocket motors. On May 31, 1988, the Divisionobserved from the test static firing of one Pershing rocket motor thatthe opacity of the plume from this activity would exceed the standard of20% set forth in the Air Quality Control Commission's Regulation No. 1.The Pueblo Army Depot, in order to obtain a permit for the destructionof the remaining rocket motors, must obtain a waiver from the above opacitystandard, or the permit will be denied. This waiver would be necessarydue to the fact that there are no presently available methods to reduceopacity to compliance levels for this source.The State adopted section II.A.9. in order to exempt the static firingof intermediate range and shorter range Pershing Missile systems from theopacity limits contained in Regulation No. 1, so long as such static firingresults in emissions less than 250 tons per year of any one pollutant,adequate monitoring is conducted, and air pollutants are not emitted indangerous quantities.The opacity requirements are found in Regulation 1, section II.A. and areprimarily designed to ensure that standard smokestack type sources of airpollution are well controlled. While opacity requirements are generallyappropriate for the control of both stack and fugitive emissions, the Stateis not, in this case, relying on the application of emission control systemsfor which opacity is an indication of proper operation.Although exempted under Regulation 1 for opacity requirements, the Statemust issue a permit for the missile destruction under Colorado RegulationNo. 3 before destruction of the missiles may commence. This permit cannotbe issued unless the State determines through air quality dispersion modelingthat the National Ambient Air Quality Standards, which protect againsthealth and other effects, are met. This permit was issued on November 3,1988, and restricts the number and time of the missle burns.EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.This action will be effective 60 days from the date of the <T4>Federal Register </T4>notice unless, within 30 days of its publication,notice is received that adverse or critical comments will be submitted.If such notice is received, this action will be withdrawn before the effectivedate by publishing two subsequent notices. One notice will withdraw thefinal action and another will begin a new rulemaking by announcing a proposalof the action and establishing a comment period. If no such comments arereceived, the public is advised that this action will be effective (60days from publication).<T4>Final Action</T4>EPA hereby approves the Colorado amendment to Colorado Regulation No. 1to exempt the destruction of missiles under the Intermediate-Range NuclearForces (INF) Treaty from meeting the opacity limits. To ensure protectionof the NAAQS, however, the State must issue a permit for the missile destructionunder Regulation 3 before destruction of the missiles may commence. Thispermit cannot be issued unless the State determines through air qualitydispersion modeling that the National Ambient Air Quality Standards whichprotect against health and other effects are met. This permit was issuedon November 3, 1988, and restricts the number and times of the missileburns.EPA finds that good cause exists for making the action taken in this noticeimmediately effective because the implementation plan revisions are alreadyin effect under State law or regulation. EPA's approval poses no additionalregulatory burden.Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.(See 46 FR 8709).Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial reviewof this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals forthe appropriate circuit by (60 days from publication). This action maynot be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See307(b)(2).)The Office of Management and Budget has exempted this rule from the requirementsof section 3 of Executive Order 12291.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 40 CFR Part 52</ITAG>Air pollution control, Particulate matter, Incorporation by reference.<ITAG tagnum="21"><T4>Note</T4>: Incorporation by reference of the State Implementation Planfor the State of Colorado was approved by the Director of the Federal Registeron July 1, 1982.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">Date: April 14, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Jack W.
