Elsewhere, two industrial plant explosions in Wyoming andConnecticut killed one man and injured 12.   Investigators in Texas have not determined the cause of theseries of explosions Monday at the Phillips Petroleum Co. plant,which produced 4.5 million pounds of plastic a day.   At midday today, safety crews discovered a reactor leakinghydrocarbon gas. Several reporters and television crews were askedto move a few hundred yards back from the cleanup area.   ``We asked the press to move back as non-members of the searchteam,'' Phillips spokesman Scott Carlberg said. ``We are taking anextremely conservative safety measure. But we see no danger ofexplosion.''   Even experts were surprised at the extent of the destruction,apparently touched off somehow in leaking ethylene and isobutanegas.   ``It's total devastation,'' said Assistant U.S. Labor SecretaryJohn Scannell, who heads the Occupational Safety and HealthAdministration.   ``In 30 years of experience in the chemical industry, I've neverseen such massive equipment twisted and strung about,'' saidScannell, who toured the plant on the Houston Ship Channel onWednesday.   Fifteen OSHA investigators joined Phillips workers cleaning upthe plant and searching for the cause of the explosion.   The clean-up continued around the clock, with big floodlightsilluminating the scene at night as workers used hydraulic shears,cranes and other heavy equipment to cut through a tangle of metalbeams and pipes.   Of the three bodies found Wednesday, two were near a storagearea for polyethylene pellets manufactured at the plant, saidcompany spokesman Bill Wicker. The third was in a maintenance area.Two others were found Monday and Tuesday.   An official of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers union saidplant employees had complained that staff shortages, long hours andan abundance of workers from outside contractors could have causedlapses in safety procedures.   The official, Bob Wages, vice president of the OCAW's oilsection, didn't have specific safety complaints about the plant.   ``It's symptomatic of what's going on in this industry,'' Wagessaid of the complaints. ``I think companies are concerned aboutsafety, but I think they have competing interests: profit andproduction.''   A natural gas explosion in August killed a worker at the plant.Union officials said the accident was an example of poorly trainedcontract labor possibly endangering Phillips workers.   Plant manager Robert Benz discounted any possible connectionbetween the use of contract workers and the two explosions. He saidcontract workers get safety seminars twice a month.   Scannell said the recovery of victims could take weeks. Part ofthe problem is that when one piece of wreckage is moved, it setsoff a chain reaction of falling debris, he said.   Outside Evanston, Wyo., a natural gas blast at an AmocoProduction Co. gas processing plant blew out a wall and threwworkers out of the building. One man was killed and 11 injured,including five in serious condition today with burns, authoritiessaid.   Investigators were trying to determine what caused natural gasto leak from a compressor building, said Amoco spokesman DickBrewster.   In New Haven, Conn., an explosion at a chemical and insulationplant left one man with serious burns. The fire that followed theblast at the Acme Division of the Allied Products Corp. was quicklyput out with dry chemicals stored inside the plant, said Fire ChiefJohn Riordan, who said the cause was under investigation.</TEXT></DOC>
