Yet our response as a nationso far has been hesitant in tone, trivial in content and verynearly humiliating in its effects.   We are not even following the obvious course of nationalself-interest. We spent hundreds of billions of dollars inthe long superpower confrontation. We have now seen theSoviet Union liquidated peacefully and at no cost to us. Weface, however, a real danger that the nuclear andgeopolitical threats posed by the Soviet Union could berevived by a rising authoritarian nationalism. Why, then, arewe doing so little to help Russia?</LP><TEXT>   Not, I believe, because our people are isolationist, butbecause we don't yet understand the depth of the humantransformation that has taken place in Russia. The Augustevents in Moscow did not produce the traditional flames of aviolent, secular revolution but rather the slow-burning innerfire of peaceful, spiritual change within individuals andsmall groups. Those soaring summer hopes have predictablygiven way to a winter of discontent that makes the fledglingRussian democracy look in many ways like a weak WeimarRepublic waiting for its Hitler. But a situation that shouldsound an alarm calling for action, has instead given rise toa fatalistic pessimism.   The only long-term security for the West lies in a Russiangovernment accountable to its people. Tragedy could belooming in our continued indifference toward a regime that isnot only removing the greatest threat to America but alsoattempting to install a basically American political andeconomic system. We seem unable to mobilize even a smallfraction of the aid we found for a Germany and Japan that hadfought us in bloody wars.   Our main excuse is that we have pressing economic problemsat home and no money to give. We are right to work withothers to provide more of the necessary financial andtechnical help. But we are still the richest of all in thefood and pharmaceuticals Russia needs to get through thewinter.   The most serious present problem for the Russians -- theirpsychological vulnerability -- is something that officialAmerica seems to understand the least, yet is in the bestposition to affect. Even more difficult for proud Russiansthan facing up to their long-deferred economic and ethnicproblems is accepting the humiliation of admitting to havinglived a collective lie for three-quarters of a century. Mr.Yeltsin has made that admission, tackled those materialproblems head on and legitimized democratic and market idealsfor ordinary Russians -- three things that Mikhail Gorbachevcould never bring himself to do.   What is at stake is not any individual leader so much asthe political future of the entire young generation ofRussian democratic reformers. They believe that U.S. policieshelped force change in the 1980s and hope for U.S. leadershipnow. They see themselves as having accomplished a &quot;greatdeed.&quot; They see us responding only with &quot;little deeds&quot; (theterm &quot;malyedela&quot; is a particularly caustic Russia term ofcontempt).   The social context of crippling inflation and ademoralized military makes anger more than hunger thegreatest threat to this fragile democracy -- and accounts forthe increasingly fascist tinge to Russian nationalism.Clearly, if we wait till the dust settles, Russian democracycould be ground into the dust, which might well turnradioactive and settle on us as well.   Of course, the current Russian commitment to democracy isnot accompanied by any real historical experience or exposureto its institutions. And it is here that the West in generaland the U.S. in particular have as yet unmobilized resourcesfor helping create democratic institutions in Russia and theother republics.   The Russians have produced in the past few years anamazing number of the kind of non-governmental associationsthat enable freedom to work in a large country: churchparishes, political clubs and parties, economic cooperatives,cultural organizations, independent unions, advocacy groups,and the like.   What they need now is what America is uniquely equipped togive: (1) a continent-wide engagement of private and localorganizations to establish direct links with counterpartorganizations in the burgeoning civil society of the formerSoviet Union; and (2) a crash program for bringing a verylarge number of Russians -- perhaps as many as 50,000 -- tothe U.S. (if they promise to go back) for four or six weeksof living and working in the key institutions of a freesociety. It is both more effective and less demeaning tobring Russians here and let them adapt our ways to theirneeds than to send too many of our advisers over there.   Democratization was defeated in China because it hadtroops but no leaders. Russia now has leaders without troops-- but the populace is thirsting for basic training. We canhelp provide it.   Authoritarianism under new banners seems likely unlesslarger numbers of Russians can gain some sense of howdemocratic and market institutions really work. We would thenrisk becoming (in a more visceral and dangerous sense thanbefore) the external enemy -- in part because we provedunwilling at a critical turning point in history to help.   The world is watching to see if the only survivingsuperpower has the magnanimity and imagination to act. Farfrom providing moral leadership for an interdependent 21stcentury, we might even have to look back and wonder if weunwittingly have become what the Soviet Union was in the 20thcentury: a superpower only in the narrow military sense. TheRussians' unprecedented act of self-liberation requires someequally unprecedented form of recognition from our side. Insome dark versions of Russian folklore, a savage bear wasoriginally just an ordinary man. But when he was denied thebread and salt of simple hospitality, he retreated to theforest and returned in a transformed state to take hisrevenge.   ---   Mr. Billington, the librarian of Congress, is the authorof the forthcoming &quot;Breakthrough to Hope: Moscow, August1991&quot; (Free Press).
