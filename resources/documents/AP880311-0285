PLC to 21.25 percent, breaching the level BPhas said was acceptable.   The Kuwait Investment Office, an agency set up for the purposeof BP investments, said it intended to push the stake to 22.5percent when market conditions permit. The group said it now holds1.269 billion BP shares.   BP Chairman Sir Peter Walters said last month that 20 percentwas an acceptable holding.   BP has declined to comment on the Kuwaiti group's latestdisclosure.   In February the KIO declared a 19.53 percent stake, or 1.165billion shares.   Analysts say BP and the British government have failed to obtainKuwaiti assurances that it will stop buying the shares.   ``I think BP will be very unhappy about the increased stake,''said Chris Grudniewicz, an analyst at Smith New Court Research.``BP will probably now try to get the British government to lean onthe Kuwaitis to get some assurance they'll stop buying.''   Recent heavy turnover in BP new shares had already raisedspeculation that the KIO was building on its stake in BP.</TEXT></DOC>
