Due credit is also given to efficient drainage,adequate inputs of organic matter, lime and microbial activity. However,it is not clear whether the earthworm is a passive exploiter or a causalagent of structure improvement. When the pressures of production endup in severe soil structure deterioration, or when massive soil disturbance,and stockpiling ends up in soils restored with little residual structure,experimental evidence suggests that the role of the earthworm is crucial.Evidence will be presented to show how earthworms, in association withall the other factors normally held to be responsible, initiate the developmentof water-stable, soil granulation. However, evidence will also be presentedwhich shows how certain features of modern agriculture are, to some extentat least, antagonistic to earthworms. In utilizing degraded land, itmay be necessary to farm initially for the benefit of the earthworm ratherthan for yield. This approach must be maintained despite the fact that,in the early stages, it may result in a phase of greater waterloggingand susceptibility to poaching. 30 refs., 4 figs., 1 tab.</TEXT></DOC>
