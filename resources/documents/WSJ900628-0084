Many simply can't do without color screens, whichare available only on bulky, desktop machines.   Now, some tired arms may get needed relief, as a fewcompanies have announced laptops with impressive colorscreens that weigh in the 15-to-20-pound range.   Dolch Computer Systems of San Jose, Calif., and DauphinTechnology of Lombard, Ill., both recently announced systems,available this fall, that use screens from Hitachi Ltd. TheU.S. arm of Sharp Corp., in Mahwah, N.J., has demonstrated asystem that it says should be available by the end of theyear. Consultants add that at least a couple of othercompanies will introduce color laptops by the fall, and suchsystems will be widely available by next spring.   There are still drawbacks, of course. The screens areexpensive, adding as much as $4,000 to the cost of a laptop.Even as prices fall over the next year, systems with colorscreens will probably carry a $1,000 to $1,500 premium. Inaddition, the systems weigh far more than the four to sixpounds of so-called notebook computers -- a weight that morecustomers are coming to expect. They also consume so muchpower that they can't run on batteries, meaning an umbilicalcord must still attach the systems to a wall socket.   The limitations mean that the systems will initially bebought only by the truly weary. But at least they're a start.                                                                                                          Help Arrives to Deliver   Satisfied Customers                                                                                                          CUSTOMERS RARELY understand why they must set aside awhole day to get that new couch delivered -- or how thedelivery person manages to always come right after they'veducked out for a short errand.   But an energy utility has produced a system that should atleast narrow that window during which delivery or service ispromised. The system should also ensure that calls are madeonly when someone is home.   The system, called C-ARDS and marketed by CNG Energy Co.of Pittsburgh, involves attaching a small computer terminalto the radio in each service van. When getting set to go tothe next stop, the driver puts the cursor on the customer'sname and hits a button. The radio transmits the name to acentral computer, which calls the home and plays a messagesaying that the service person will arrive within a fewminutes. If no one picks up the phone, the visit isrescheduled.   Because the driver checks in after finishing each job,that also helps the central office keep track of who's whereat what time. Cox Cable Cleveland Area Inc., a unit of CoxEnterprises Inc. and a test site for the CNG system, saysC-ARDS has let it narrow the window during which it promisesservice to roughly three hours from four. The system alsolets the cable-TV company call customers during the day ofinstallation or repair and give them more precise estimates.   &quot;It's working,&quot; says Ron Hammaker, general manager of CoxCable Cleveland.   Now if that couch could just come on a Saturday.                                                                                                          One Little Chip Spells   A Lot More Capacity                                                                                                          THE DAYS are long gone when having any sort of hard diskin a personal computer was considered a luxury. These days,many PCs have hard disks that can store 320 megabytes ofdata, and some even surpass a gigabyte -- a billioncharacters of data, or enough capacity to store as many GreatAmerican Novels as most people would ever care to write.   But consumers thirst for capacity, so computer makers tryto stuff bigger and bigger disk drives in their machines.   InfoChip Systems Inc., a small company in Santa Clara,Calif., says it has an easy way to increase capacity, andwithout bigger disk drives: It has a chip that it says willroughly triple the capacity of current disk drives.   InfoChip will sell the chip on a $199 circuit board, whichbuyers can simply plug into their existing PCs to instantlyadd bytes. The company also hopes to sell the chip to PCmakers, which can build them into their computers,inexpensively enlarging capacity.   The chip operates by doing very fast compression of datawhen the PC is trying to write on the hard disk and,conversely, rapid decompression when the central processor istrying to read data. InfoChip says the chip shouldn't slowthe system; writing data can take longer, but reading datacan be done faster.   John Murphy, a consultant at Wohl andamp; Associates, BalaCynwyd, Pa., who saw the chip demonstrated at the Comdextrade show this month, says: &quot;This is the most interestingthing I've seen at Comdex in years.&quot;                                                                                                          Odds and Ends                                                                                                          THE PIPE ORGAN at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris hasbeen a group undertaking for centuries, with the organisthopping around to the various keyboards while assistants workthe stops that help control them. Complicating thingsfurther, it can take seconds for a keystroke to work its waythrough the instrument and reach the huge pipes. Now, an IBMPC is being wired into the works, letting the organistprogram the positions of the stops ahead of time andeliminate the delay in the sounds. . . . A chemistry journaledited at the University of California-Santa Cruz not only isdistributed on floppy disks: Tetrahedron ComputerMethodology, published by Pergamon Press, includes softwareon the disks that do such things as draw 3-D molecules androtate them on-screen to demonstrate a point.</TEXT></DOC>
