The bankers told the Senate Banking subcommittee on consumer andregulatory affairs that banks have been doing a good job ofvoluntarily meeting the needs of the poor and elderly and shouldnot have new government requirements imposed on them as proposed bySen. Howard Metzenbaum, D-Ohio.   ``How can it make sense for Washington to mandate one rigidapproach which is supposed to meet the needs of all our diversecommunities?'' asked American Bankers Association representativeRobert L. Stevens, president of the Bryn Mawr Trust Co. inPennsylvania.   But officials of organizations representing consumers and theelderly told the panel that financial institutions ought to beashamed to argue against government involvement at a time whenCongress is considering a $300 billion rescue of the savings andloan industry.   ``Banking lobbyists have often stated that the banking industryis a private enterprise and should not be looked on as having tofill any given public purpose,'' said Peggy Miller of the ConsumerFederation of America. ``Such an assumption made in the face of theastronomical costs to the public of the Sandamp;L bailout isindefensible.''   Metzenbaum had originally tried to enact his proposals byattaching them to the Sandamp;L bailout bill passed by the Senate April19, but he backed off after Sen. Alan J. Dixon, D-Ill., chairman ofthe subcommittee, promised him a hearing.   Dixon said he was keeping an open mind on the proposals andwould decide ``in a month or so'' whether to begin moving themthrough the legislative process.   One of Metzenbaum's bills would require banks and Sandamp;Ls to cashgovernment checks, such as welfare and Social Security payments, ofup to $1,500 for non-customers with proper identification. Theinstitutions would be permitted to cover their costs through a lowfee set by the Federal Reserve.   The second measure would require financial institutions to offerlow-cost accounts with a minimum balance of $25 and a maximumbalance of $1,000. The institutions would have to provide monthlystatements and permit up to 10 checks or withdrawals a month.   ``This is not drastic or draconian legislation. It's a verymodest proposal,'' he said.   However, banking groups complained they would suffer losses fromfraud if denied the right to refuse to cash a check.   The ABA said a survey showed that more than half of all banksand three-quarters of large banks already offer low-cost basicaccounts and 80 percent cash government checks for non-customers.As an alternative to mandated check-cashing, the bankers advocatedexpanding government programs to directly deposit checks into bankaccounts.   But consumer groups and the American Association of RetiredPersons said low-income people often can't afford bank accounts andare forced to rely on expensive check-cashing services. Also, theAARP said many elderly people were suspicious of direct deposits,believing their money could be misdirected.   Miller said the industry's claim that more than half of allbanks offer low-cost accounts is flawed because they too broadlydefine low-cost. She said only one in four banks offers checkingaccounts with a $3 or less monthly fee.   The Senate panel is holding another hearing Wednesday on a thirdMetzenbaum proposal that would require banks and Sandamp;Ls to makepublic their record of serving poor and minority neighborhoods.   Other banking groups opposing Metzenbaum are the IndependentBankers Association of America and the Consumer Bankers Association.</TEXT></DOC>
