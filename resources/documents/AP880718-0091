An end to the war could also be an ominous development forIsrael. Both Iran and Iraq are enemies of the Jewish state, buthave been preoccupied with fighting each other.   The brief statement released today by the official IslamicRepublic News Agency, in which Tehran said it accepted a U.N.cease-fire resolution, raised hopes that the war would finally cometo an end.   Iran, which has suffered a series of defeats at Iraqi hands inrecent months, may have decided finally to accept an end to theconflict. Alternatively, it may be seeking time to rebuild itsbattered war machine.   Early reaction from Iraq was cautious.   Iraq's information minister, Nassif Ltayyif Jassem, said Iranaccepted the resolution for tactical reasons and not out of anydesire for peace.   ``Our previous knowledge of the devious Iranian regime makes usbe cautious and wary until peace is achieved and until we reach anagreement between Iran and Iraq for peace,'' he was quoted by theIraqi News Agency as saying.   Iraq accepted the U.N. resolution soon after it was issued lastyear.   With eight years of hostility to overcome, each side will behighly suspicious of the other's motives _ a factor that coulddelay a shift away from military spending.   But an end to clashes on land and over the Persian Gulf wouldremove a major threat to the countries that provide much of theworld's oil supplies and sit on half of its known oil reserves.   There would be no need for the United States to maintain amassive and costly fleet in the Persian Gulf to protect oilshipping from war-related attacks _ and to prevent growing Sovietinfluence.   The removal of the U.S. fleet and U.S. pressure for an armsembargo of Iran would remove a major source of friction between theUnited States and a country it has long viewed as vitallystrategic. Improved relations could benefit the Americans heldhostage by pro-Iranian factions in Lebanon.   Iraq and Iran would be free to use some of their massive oilwealth to rebuild their war-ravaged cities, ports and oilfacilities rather than buying military hardware from China, France,the Soviet Union and elsewhere.   An end to clashes would lessen hostility between Iran and Iraq'smain Arab backers _ Kuwait and Saudi Arabia _ which have sufferedmissile strikes, attacks on ships and terrorist acts apparentlylinked to their support of Iraq.   Iran and Iraq will also be under pressure from their war-wearypopulations to once again fill their ill-stocked shops withaffordable consumer goods and their pockets with the money to buythem.   Businessmen throughout the world who have suffered for yearswith unpaid credits to Iraq and lost business opportunities in Iranwill be looking for massive rewards in the reconstruction efforts.   Munition makers will suffer. Contractors will benefit,especially the Japanese, French, West German and Korean companieswho have stood by the war-stricken countries through hard times.   The effect on global oil markets is uncertain.   But freed from Iraqi attacks on its oil shipping, Iran would beable to increase its oil exports at least to the 2.37 millionbarrels-a-day quota laid down by the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries at a time of excess supply and soft prices.   Iraq, which has no quota because of its insistance that it havethe same quota as Iran, is producing 2.7 million barrels a day andexporting via pipelines through Saudi Arabia and Turkey. Its gulfports were shut down at the start of the war.   Unlike Iran _ which has largely avoided debt _ Iraq facesrepayment of $30 billion in debts to Western governments andprivate companies _ although an end to the war would probablyloosen further credits.   ``You've got a country with over 200 billion barrels of provenoil reserves. They plainly have a way to repay,'' a Westerndiplomat in Baghdad said earlier this year.   The end of the so-called tanker war in the gulf would slashmassive insurance premiums now charged for ships in the waterway,making it more attractive for ships to use ports and drydocks there.   Investors who have been fearful of putting money onto the rim ofa war zone should be attracted back to states such as Bahrain andDubai.   Ports just outside the gulf, such as Fujaira and Khor Fhakkan,would probably suffer as they lose traffic which had flocked thereto avoid the costly, hazardous journey up the gulf.</TEXT><TEXT>   John Rice has been a correspondent for The Associated Press inAmman, Jordan, for three years and rewgularly covers other MiddleEastern countries.</TEXT></DOC>
