(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A Roman Catholic parish has applied tosell tickets for Wisconsin's new lottery, and the church secretarysays more churches may take up the idea.   State officials said Sts. Cyril and Methodius Catholic Churchappears to be the first religious institution in Wisconsin to applyto sell tickets.   But even if the application is granted, the church has beenordered to wait until after Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert Weaklandreviews the matter, the Rev. Richard Fleischman, pastor of thechurch, said Thursday.   Fleischman said he did not expect the application to be approvedbecause the parish would only sell the tickets at its bingo games,about once a week.   ``But I thought, `What the heck. It's worth a try.' ... It's notlike we'd be selling them daily at the rectory,'' the priest said.   Janet Maurin, the church's secretary, predicts other churchesthat operate bingo games also will apply to sell lottery tickets tohelp pay for financially strapped parochial schools.   The lottery receives up to 100 applications a day, so morechurches may be applying, said lottery spokesman Rick Berg. He saidchurches would be treated the same as the 3,500 commercialretailers who also have applied to sell tickets. The approvalprocess includes background checks of all people listed on theapplication.   Many clergy in Wisconsin argued gambling was sinful and opposedthe lottery when the proposal was made. The games are scheduled tobegin in September, almost 18 months after voters approved them.   ``With the Catholic Church depending on bingo, they don't feelthat way around here,'' Maurin said.   Fleischman said he wished the church could avoid fund-raisersthat involved gambling, but he said they were necessary to meet themonthly expenses of the parish and school.   ``The fact is some people contribute more when they're having alittle fun, too,'' he said.   There's no estimate on how much the church might make off thelottery. Retailers receive 5 percent commissions on ticket sales.</TEXT></DOC>
