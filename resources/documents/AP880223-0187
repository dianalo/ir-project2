GANS</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Western nations are luring away tens ofthousands of Poland's most skilled professionals, causing a costly``brain drain'' of its best and brightest young people, thegovernment charged Tuesday.   Government spokesman Jerzy Urban said the West is cashing in onPoland's costly investment in education and threatening to prolonghis country's economic crisis.   He said more than 500,000 Poles emigrated to the West between1983 and 1987, including nearly 60,000 university graduates. Thelosses include 19,000 engineers, 5,500 physicians, 4,800 economistsand 4,000 scientists.   ``There is a brain drain in the Western emigration policy'' thatmakes it difficult for unskilled workers to remain abroad but which``eagerly retains experts in demanded specialties,'' Urban said.   ``The rich West, which is criticizing socialism, is sucking fromPoland a part of socialism's achievement,'' he said. ``We aresuffering these losses in favor of countries which in general ...are very reluctant to undertake economic cooperation with Polandwhich would back our reforms.''.   The educations of the doctors and engineers who have fled thecountry between 1983 and 1987 is about $100 million, Urban said.   Urban's comments, read from a text at the beginning of hisweekly news conference, mirrored charges made in November by Sovietleader Mikhail Gorbachev.   In an interview with NBC News, Gorbachev replied to a questionon the Soviet policy toward Jewish emigration by saying U.S.officials are trying to solve their problems by ``organizing abrain drain from the Soviet Union.''   Urban did not specify what steps the government might take tostem the wave of emigration, saying he was only appealing to allPoles to express their views on a problem ``for which there is nosimple remedy.''   Urban did say that Western countries should take theconsequences of the brain drain into consideration ``in balancingmutal economic relations and commitments,'' an apparent referenceto Poland's efforts to obtain new economic credits and a favorabledebt payment rescheduling from its Western creditors.   Urban's remarks reflect growing concern in the country to thelarge numbers of young professionals fleeing the country's economiccrisis for greener pastures in the United States, West Germany,Italy and France, among other countries.   Last month, a joint government and Roman Catholic Churchcommission expressed concern about what it called an ``alarmingphenomenon'' and called for measures to convince young Poles thatthey can satisfy their aspirations in their native country.   Official newspapers have printed articles about emigration,including letters from young professionals explaining why they wantto leave. Government polls have shown that more than half Poland'syouth would like to stay in the West to work for two years or more.   Emigration has grown since the lifting of martial law in 1983,when the government liberalized regulations for obtaining apassport to travel abroad. Urban said Poles made 4.2 million tripsto Western countries from 1983-87.   He said those staying abroad were motivated by economic ratherthan political reasons, describing their attitude as``mean-spirited ... turning the back on the homeland instead ofworking in favor of improving living conditions.''   But he added the government did not intend to withdraw from itsliberalized passport policy.   Some Soviet bloc countries, such as Romania, have demanded thatwould-be emigres repay the cost of their education before departing.   From 1983 to 1987, Urban said, 58,500 people emigrated legallyfrom Poland, including 5,000 university graduates.   Another 117,000 people, including 16,500 university graduates,traveled to the West on business or tourist trips and then stayedpermanently abroad without consent of Polish authorities.   He said 328,000 people, including 38,000 with universitydegrees, extended their stay abroad, although many were expected toreturn to Poland, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
