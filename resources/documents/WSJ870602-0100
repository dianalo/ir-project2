But this time, the source isn't the left but the right.    Arms-control negotiations between the U.S. and the Soviet Union have sparked anger and fear within Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic party. Right-wingers, some of whom were once staunchly pro-American, now speak of &quot;Verrat,&quot; the German word for betrayal. And as they grope for answers to their security concerns, they are escalating talk of a reunified and neutralized Germany.    &quot;There is great bitterness&quot; over the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's response to Germany's security concerns, says Juergen Todenhoefer, a Christian Democratic party spokesman for defense matters. &quot;We are very disappointed and we feel betrayed. . . . The U.S. is forcing us to find other security arrangements and that will strengthen neutralism.&quot;    A senior adviser to Chancellor Kohl adds: &quot;The right and the left are coming to more or less the same conclusions, for different reasons.&quot; He says he fears that the Soviet Union may seek to exploit the neutralist sentiment.    Already there are suggestions that may be happening. The Soviets have strongly denied speculation in Germany that they might offer to tear down the Berlin Wall or otherwise reunite the two Germanys in exchange for West German neutrality. Still, they undoubtedly welcome such rumormongering. &quot;They are happy this discussion is going on,&quot; says Mr. Kohl's adviser. &quot;Without doing anything, the Soviets create a mood here that is dangerous.&quot;    The division of Germany is a powerful issue for Germans, many of whom have family members behind the Iron Curtain. The constitution itself sets reunification as a national goal. And, to this day, many people on the left say Germany erred when, in 1952, it rejected Josef Stalin's offer to unite the two Germanys and instead chose allegiance to the West.    No one seriously expects the Soviets to play the &quot;German card,&quot; as diplomats call the issue of reunification. Opening such a debate could spur other East European countries to try to break loose from the Soviet sphere. Besides, the very idea of recreating a unified German state is anathema to the leadership of the Soviet Union, a nation that was almost conquered by Hitler's armies.    Still, just the fact that the speculation is seriously discussed here by intelligent people -- apparently, it was started by Mr. Kohl himself in a background briefing for German reporters -- says a lot about public opinion in Germany. For one thing, Mikhail Gorbachev's bold initiatives have caught the Atlantic alliance off balance and have so spellbound the German citizenry that many now believe the Soviets might be prepared to offer anything.    Moreover, a growing segment of the population probably wishes the Soviet leader would make a reunification offer. Not only the left is restive; the right believes Germany has been offered an arms-control &quot;fait accompli&quot; that gives short shrift to German security concerns.    The so-called double-zero option, which the Soviets have proposed, would eliminate all nuclear weapons in Europe above the range of 300 miles. As expected, the Bonn government yesterday reluctantly gave its official approval to the Western alliance's counteroffer, which would eliminate all but 72 aging Pershing 1A missiles. But the Germans still have deep reservations because the U.S. appears unwilling to negotiate reductions below the 300-mile range and has suggested further missile deployments might be necessary to offset the more than 15-to-1 superiority of the Warsaw Pact in this missile category. Thus, the Germans fear they are being singled out as the sole battlefield in a limited nuclear war -- and that they might be asked to accept new U.S. missiles.    As a result, the Germans are looking to France and elsewhere for defense alternatives to safeguard their security. And although it isn't a widespread view yet, some right-wingers now say that because the U.S. is withdrawing from the defense of Europe, maybe Bonn should seek Soviet support to reunite the two Germanys.    &quot;There's a desire to want change and to see Gorbachev as a symbol of change,&quot; says Richard Burt, the U.S. ambassador to West Germany.    Recent polling data reflect that desire. The German public now believes, by a margin of 49-to-46, that Mr. Gorbachev is making greater efforts to achieve peace than President Reagan, according to the Allensbach Institute. And while 60% of French citizens believe France should maintain its nuclear force, even if the U.S. and Soviets abolish theirs, nearly half of Germans surveyed see unilateral disarmament as the best way to achieve peace.    Among the most alarmed at this drift toward pacifism are the French, who want to cement military ties to West Germany to prevent Bonn's slide toward neutrality.    When questioned about Germany's reliability at the last two Franco-German summits, Chancellor Kohl told French reporters: &quot;We cannot be bought&quot; by Soviet reunification offers. Some members of his own party are beginning to wonder if that's true. </TEXT></DOC>
