An embassy employee in Damascus, who spoke on condition ofanonymity, said he saw Schray being escorted into the embassy ataround noon. The 30-year-old industrial engineer was kidnapped Jan.27 and released before dawn.   ``He is still inside, resting and waiting for his wife,'' theemployee said. ``A car has been sent to Beirut to bring her.''   A military source at the Syrian command in Beirut, also speakingon condition of anonymity, told The Associated Press that Schraywas driven to the Syrian capital, 56 miles east of Beirut, underheavy Syrian escort.   In a statement issued in Bonn, Foreign Minister Hans-DietrichGenscher thanked the Syrian government for its help. A ministrystatement said Schray was in good physical condition.   Schray, a Lebanese-born West German, was seized in Moslem westBeirut. A Shiite faction, Holy Warriors for Freedom, on Wednesdayclaimed responsibility for his abduction.   The group also claimed responsibility for kidnapping two otherWest Germans in Beirut in January 1987. It is believed headed bythe brother of two Lebanese Shiite Moslems who are being held inWest Germany on terrorism and kidnapping charges.   Schray's mother, Fahima Schray, called her son's captivity ``themost terrible days of my life. It was so difficult.'' Mrs. Schraywas interviewed in Fort Myers, Fla.   ``I couldn't sleep last night one minute. This morning,everything has changed completely, as if I'm a new woman,'' shesaid.   Schray's Lebanese wife of six months, Rana Mounla, and hisuncle, George abu Nassar, left by car for Damascus carrying asuitcase of clothes for the freed German.   ``I'm going to see him,'' a beaming Mrs. Schray told reporters.``I'm taking clothes for him.''   She indicated that she planned to return to Beirut with herhusband from Damascus. ``When we're back together in Beiruttomorrow we'll both talk to you,'' she said. She declined toelaborate.   Abu Nassar, a wealthy Lebanese businessman of Palestiniandescent, refused to talk to reporters.   There are still 22 foreigners missing after being kidnapped inLebanon. They include nine Americans, four Frenchmen, threeBritons, a West German, an Italian, an Irishman, an Indian and twounidentified men.   Longest held is American Terry Anderson, chief Middle Eastcorrespondent for The Associated Press. He was kidnapped March 16,1985.   The Holy Warriors for Freedom made its claim in a typewrittenArabic statement released to the Reuters news agency in Beirut. Itwas accompanied by a recent snapshot of Schray.   The statement said Schray could be released within hours as aresult of mediation by Syrian President Hafez Assad.   Abdul-Hadi Hamadi is reputed to lead the Holy Warriors forFreedom, and he also heads the security apparatus of thepro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God.   Hamadi's brother, Abbas Hamadi, is on trial in West Germany oncharges of kidnapping West Germans Rudolf Cordes and Alfred Schmidtin January 1987 in Beirut.   Those kidnappings allegedly were to pressure the Bonn governmentinto releasing a third Hamadi brother, Mohammed, who is being heldin Frankfurt on terrorism charges.   In their statement Wednesday, the kidnappers said that whilethey were negotiating with the West Germans over Schray, ``amediation team from the brothers in Syria, led by President Assad,gave a chance for a new round of commitments that made the case ofthe German Schray head for a solution within the coming hours.''   ``The Hamadi brothers are still in Germany. The release (ofSchray) is goodwill gesture No. 2,'' it added.   Schmidt, 47, was released Sept. 7 as a goodwill gesture. Cordes,53, is still in captivity.   Mohammed Hamadi has been indicted in the United States on murderand air piracy charges in connection with the June 1985 hijackingof a TWA jetliner in which 39 Americans were held hostage and aU.S. Navy diver was killed.   He was arrested Jan. 13, 1987 when he arrived at Frankfurtairport carrying explosives. The Bonn government last year turneddown a U.S. request for his extradition, saying he will be tried inWest Germany on similar charges.   Cordes was kidnapped in Beirut on Jan. 17, 1987, and Schmidtseven days later, on Jan. 21, 1987.   Abbas Hamadi was arrested also upon arriving at Frankfurtairport Jan. 26, five days after Schmidt was abducted. </TEXT></DOC>
