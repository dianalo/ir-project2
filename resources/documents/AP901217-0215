The odds aren't as great as you may think, even if you're anolder woman, says Barbara Lovenheim, author of ``Beating theMarriage Odds: When You are Smart, Single and Over 35'' (WilliamMorrow).   Lovenheim reviews the statistics from a variety of sources,including the Bennett-Bloom report of several years ago, whichconcluded that women over 40 had only a 1.3 percent chance ofmarrying, and the National Center for Health Statistics figures,which show that a 40-year-old woman has a 24 percent chance.   ``For one thing, (the statistics) show that a woman's maritalprobabilities really do decline as she ages. That is a fact,''Lovenheim writes. ``The bright side of these statistics is that alarge number of women can - and do - marry at every age. Af40-year-old single woman can find a husband and so can a 52-oldsingle woman. A 38-year-old divorced woman may find a new spouse,and a 49-year-old divorced woman is not at all out of therunning.'' --   ``The Perfect Wedding Planner'' (Delacorte Press) is arecord-keeper, planner and reference guide in one looseleaf binder.   Authors Barbara Binswanger and Jim Charlton have laid out acalendar and checklist for all those details you need to thinkabout for your wedding, including the ceremony, reception,printing, clothing, parties, guests and accommodation, gifts, thelicence, the honeymoon and newspaper publicity. Along with these,they've added practical advice on all these subjects.</TEXT></DOC>
