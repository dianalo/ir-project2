The vote was 85-0.   Thornburgh succeeds Edwin Meese III, who quit after pronouncinghimself exonerated by an independent counsel's report thatconcluded he ``probably'' broke the law.   The Senate adjourned until Sept. 7 without acting on three othernominees for top Justice Department positions. Several senatorsused parliamentary maneuvering to block action until the Senatefirst took up legislation to enforce a treaty against genocide. Thegenocide legislation was not considered.   The three already are serving in acting capacities: HaroldChristensen as deputy attorney general; Francis A. Keating II asassociate attorney general; and Edward S.G. Dennis Jr. as chief ofthe criminal division.   All four were recommended unanimously for confirmation by theSenate Judiciary Committee, which acted on Thornburgh's nominationWednesday by voice vote, without debate. The other three werecleared by the panel Aug. 3.   Thornburgh, in a television interview broadcast Thursday inPhiladelphia, said he had no indication that Vice President GeorgeBush would retain him if elected president.   ``I look on this as a six-month assignment,'' Thornburgh said.``Every day will be important because the process of lawenforcement is a 24-hour-a-day, seven-day a week, year-roundproposition and I'm anxious and enthusiastic about getting on thejob. ... We'll let the future take care of itself.''   ``Clearly, we have a superior nominee here,'' Sen. Paul Simon,D-Ill., said of Thornburgh as members of both parties praised theformer Pennsylvania governor.   Sen. Strom Thurmond, R-S.C. said Thornburgh has demonstrated thecharacteristics needed for the job: ``character, integrity, goodjudgment, competence and independence.''   Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass., praised Thornburgh but alsocriticized Meese as one willing to ``roll back decades of progresson civil rights.''   Kennedy predicted Thornburgh ``will do as much as he can torepair the damage of the Meese regime.''   Meese has strongly disagreed with such comments, contending hisconduct was ethical and that department morale remained high whilehe was investigated.   Thornburgh, 56, a former two-term Pennsylvania Republicangovernor, promised senators last week that he would run thedepartment with the ``highest ethical standards.'' He pledged notto interfere with an ongoing internal department investigation ofMeese.   The predecessors of Christensen and Dennis _ former DeputyAttorney General Arnold Burns and ex-criminal division chiefWilliam Weld _ announced their resignations last March to protestMeese's continued tenure in the face of the investigation byindependent counsel James McKay.   Keating was named to replace Steve Trott, who now is a federalappellate judge.   Thornburgh ran the Justice Department's criminal division duringthe Ford administration, and established the public integritysection that prosecutes corrupt public officials. Currently, hedirects the Institute of Politics of Harvard University's KennedySchool of Government.   He told senators last week he is every bit the Reagan loyalist,declaring, ``His agenda is my agenda.''   Thornburgh said fighting the ``scourge of narcortics'' would behis top priority. He promised a vigorous battle against organizedcrime, public corruption and white-collar crime, while safeguardingcivil liberties.   McKay concluded in an 800-plus page report that Meese``probably'' broke two tax laws and twice violated a federalconflict-of-interest statute _ but he declined to prosecute theattorney general.</TEXT></DOC>
