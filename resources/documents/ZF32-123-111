 But along with the premium prices of as much as $30 perslide for super-rush service comes a nagging question: Is it time to investas little as $5,000 to bring the slide-making process in-house?andM;The answer depends largely on the customer and the quality of slides andoverheads required.andP;  Companies that produce hundreds of slides annually onrelatively loose deadlines may be able to do their own work -- and savethousands of dollars in the process.andM;Users who produce relatively few slides may find that it's simply not worththe bother to fend for themselves.andM;Whether you continue to send out your slide work or bring it in-house, youwill make some compromises.andM;Quality remains subjective.andP;  What's good enough for one presentation won't befor another.andP;  In gauging which way to go, the three most important factorsare cost, convenience and control.andM;Pricing service bureaus.andP;  A handful of national service bureaus and some4,000 local companies compete for the business generated by more than 10million slide presenters nationwide.andM;Prices at the national services are fairly consistent, while smaller localfirms may charge a few dollars less per slide or overhead transparency.andM;As with all service-based industries, there's a direct correlation betweentime and money.andP;  The lowest prices are about $6 per slide and can take aslong as three days, while the $30-per-slide premium can deliver a six-hourturnaround.andM;The majority of users expect slides within 24 hours and pay between $10 and$15 per slide.andP;  Verifying whether the service bureau requires one or two daysto complete what's billed as a &quot;normal&quot; job is critical because rush chargescan easily add 50 percent to the cost of a standard job.andM;Investing in a film recorder.andP;  With desktop film recorders priced as low as$4,500, it's easy to see how a company producing just a few hundred slideseach year can quickly make a low-end film recorder pay for itself.andP;  There arealso a growing number of large, corporate graphics departments investing inprofessional-quality recorders at prices upward of $40,000.andM;&quot;At $17,000, you get boardroom-quality slides,&quot; said Gene Howie, president ofPark Business Systems Inc., a reseller of film recorders in Stamford, Conn.andO;&quot;When you get to $35,000, one of the main things you're buying is speed.&quot;andM;But buying the recorder is just the first step.andP;  True costs include anoperator's salary, as well as the cost of a dedicated Mac if the recorder isused on a regular basis; many corporate graphics departments use a Mac IIcito do the job.andM;Certain film recorders require a software driver for each presentation ordrawing package, which can cost about $500 per application.andP;  Interface boardsand cabling can add another $1,000, bringing the total hardware investment toat least $11,000 and probably more.andM;Don't forget the need for a service contract, which amounts to about 10percent of the system's purchase price.andP;  The film may be the biggest bargain-- it costs about 50 cents a frame, including processing.andM;Convenience.andP;  Professional-quality film recorders can produce a slide in aslittle as two minutes, while $5,000 desktop models can take as long as 20minutes to deliver a complicated image.andM;&quot;If you're doing 40 or 50 slides, you'll be processing them all day long,&quot;said Tony Freeman, a partner in Publication Technologies Inc., an electronicpublishing consulting firm in Stamford, Conn.andM;Sending the recorded film out to a one-hour photo lab for developingtypically adds about three hours to the process, including commuting time,while processing the film internally takes about 45 minutes.andP;  In either case,the turnaround is several times faster than that offered by almost anyservice bureau.andM;&quot;Graphics is a deadline-driven business,&quot; said Bill Lunnie, manager ofgraphic communications for General Electric Co., which recently invested$55,000 in a Solitaire film recorder with a 400- exposure bulk film loaderfrom Management Graphics Inc.andM;(AmoLunnie's six-person department produces several thousand slides annuallyfor GE's corporate headquarters in Fairfield, Conn., where managers oftenupdate financial presentations until the last possible minute.andM;Keeping production in-house also eliminates the possibility of strangersgaining unauthorized access to confidential information, such as financialreports.andM;Service-bureau speed.andP;  But the service bureau delivers a different kind ofsecurity, according to Cliff Leach, general manager of imaging services forAutographix Inc., a nationwide association of service bureaus.andM;&quot;Do you really want to take on all the obligations for meeting thedeadlines?&quot; he asked.andP;  &quot;If you're using the right kind of service bureau, ithas a no-excuses policy; if your material is in the shop when you say it willbe, we'll have it ready.&quot;andM;Many bureaus coach new users through the entire process and even offer freeadvice on designing slides.andM;The best bureaus carefully screen slides before imaging them and notifycustomers if something is amiss in the formatting or layout.andM;But no service bureau will absorb the cost of redoing slides with typos orother editorial oversights.andP;  In other words, disorganized clients can counton paying for mistakes that should have been avoided.andM;Most leading service bureaus accept files directly from at least some of the15 or so most popular Macintosh presentation and drawing packages.andP;  Not everyservice supports every package, however.andP;  So if you're shopping around, findout if the service you're considering hiring supports the packages youprefer.andM;Among the applications most likely to be supported by service bureaus areAldus Persuasion, Adobe Illustrator, Deneba Software's Canvas, ComputerAssociates International Inc.'s CA-Cricket Presents, Claris Corp.'s MacDraw,Symantec Corp.'s MORE and Microsoft Corp.'s PowerPoint.andM;Control.andP;  But those relying on a service bureau relinquish some control oncethey transmit their order.andP;  Most bureaus have toll-free bulletin boards andprovide the necessary communications software, but users who have spent dayscrafting a presentation inevitably worry that the slides won't arrive intact.andM;&quot;Once clients get over the initial fear of sending off a file, they realizeno one will mess it up and that they will get it back the next day,&quot; said BobReiner, president of MagiCorp Ltd., a service bureau based in Tarrytown,N.Y., that accepts deliveries as late as 10 p.m.andP;  for turnaround by thefollowing morning.andP;  &quot;Then they don't want to be bothered with doing itthemselves.&quot;andM;Aldus Corp.andM;Aldus Persuasion 2.0: $495;
