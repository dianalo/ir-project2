Rep. John Conyers, D-Mich., on Wednesday made the firsttelephone call, a discussion of day care facilities with aDepartment of Veterans Affairs official in Indianapolis and aDepartment of Energy official in Spokane, Wash.   The brief, three-way conversation was piped into a loudspeakerin the office of GSA's acting administrator, Richard G. Austin,where a gaggle of relieved telephone and government representativesapplauded the connection.   Austin, with a bit of fumbling with unfamiliar equipment, thentransmitted and received electronic messages with the two distantcallers that were displayed on a nearby television screen.   Conyers, chairman of the House Government Operations Committee,which oversaw development of the new Federal TelecommunicationsSystem 2000 long-distance network, told the gathering thestate-of-the art system was a ``daring, innovative, massive leapinto the next century.''   Austin said that when FTS2000 is fully implemented it willprovide a host of voice, video and high-speed data services to1,300 federal sites nationwide in what the government says is thelargest network of its kind. The voice part of the system will befully in place by mid-1990.   FTS2000 is expected to slice at least $200 million annually offthe government's $400 million yearly phone bill when it is fully inplace. Austin said savings should surpass $2 billion over the10-year contract.   ``We will exceed the $2 billion mark by a considerabledistance,'' Austin predicted.   Austin, in an interview later, said that as government use ofFTS2000 increases and volume discounts kick in, ``We could seeupwards of $1 billion a year in hard-cash savings when the systemis fully operational.''   Austin said the network, which actually began operation Friday,when the first of 31 government sites were tied into FTS2000,already had carried 150,000 telephone calls.   He said 17 ``minor'' problems had been reported out of the150,000 calls _ 10 numbers were reached incorrectly and there wereseven pre-programmed dialing errors.   The 10-year, fixed-price contract, which GSA awarded lastDecember following a lengthy contract-letting process andchallenges by failed bidders, could be worth as much as $25 billionto the two prime contractors, the American Telephone and TelegraphCo. and US Sprint Communications Co.   ATandamp;T has 60 percent of the network; Sprint 40 percent.   Richard J. Lombardi, ATandamp;T vice president for federal systems,said the contract was a ``model'' for government procurement.   FTS2000 will serve nearly 1.3 million federal employees and isexpected to handle more than 300 million calls annually.   The network utilizes digital and fiber-optic technology forintegrated voice, data and video services, including voice andhigh-speed data transmission, electronic mail, high-speed facsimiletransmission and full-motion video conferencing.</TEXT></DOC>
