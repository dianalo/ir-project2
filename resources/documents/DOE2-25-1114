Compares efficiency and cost per 1 m{sup 3} ofthese transport methods. The overburden conveyor bridges, their specificationsand microcomputer control are described. Describes utilization of microcomputertechniques, especially the stereochart system of Carl Zeiss Jena, forautomated processing of data on surface mine geometry. Other computerapplications are also presented, e.g. for surveying, slope stabilitycalculation, and conveyor bridge control. Maintains that applicationof the KED/KEM microcomputer system for overburden conveyor bridge controlincreases its effectiveness by 10%, i.e. by 8 million m{sup 3}/a.</TEXT></DOC>
