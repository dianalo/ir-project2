Apcar (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> GOVMT </CO><IN> BNK </IN><DATELINE> SAN ANTONIO, Texas  </DATELINE><TEXT>   A top federal bank regulator predicted that 1988 will be the worst year of the Texas banking crisis.    &quot;Our belief is this will be the worst year in Texas and next year will be better,&quot; said L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp., in a meeting with news reporters here.    Mr. Seidman said he sees signs of a &quot;bottoming out&quot; in the deterioration at smaller banks, and a general improvement in the economy statewide. &quot;Damage to larger banks will be known and contained this year,&quot; he said. &quot;Most major banks will have been able to handle it this year.&quot;    However, Mr. Seidman stopped short of predicting that the pending rescue of Dallas's First RepublicBank Corp. would be the last of the big bank bailouts in Texas.    Mr. Seidman said he doesn't quarrel with a forecast by a state bank regulator that there will be a record 70 Texas bank failures this year, up from 50 last year. But he declined to discuss the outlook for specific institutions. Whatever the number, he said, &quot;we don't see any problems we aren't geared up to handle.&quot;    Ever since the collapse in oil prices and real estate values in the Southwest, nearly all of Texas's major banks have been recording record losses. The FDIC has granted assistance to two of them, is weighing requests for aid from two others and two more have been acquired by out-of-state banking companies. The proposed bailout for First RepublicBank could surpass the $4.5 billion rescue in 1984 of Continental Illinois Corp.    First RepublicBank isn't related to First Republic Bancorp. of San Francisco.    To find more buyers for failing institutions, the FDIC recently launched a program that gives potential bidders more time to evaluate whether they want to purchase a failing institution and gives them more complete financial data on the troubled bank. Instead of conducting a hastily called bidders' meeting over a weekend in a &quot;war room,&quot; away from the bank, bidders are secretly invited into the bank to inspect its books and make a bid. In some cases, the bidders and the regulators have had as much as five weeks to negotiate a transaction before the bank would have been closed.    The bidding process allows investors to purchase the bank's assets and liabilities on a continuing business, or with some form of FDIC financial assistance. The FDIC usually awards the banks to the bid that would cost the FDIC the least amount of money.    So far, the new system is attracting buyers. At one small Dallas bank recently, as many as six bidders vied for the bank, the FDIC said. Of the 35 bank failures so far this year in the Southwest, the agency said more than half were &quot;whole bank&quot; purchases in which the buyers acquired the bank's entire business. </TEXT></DOC>
