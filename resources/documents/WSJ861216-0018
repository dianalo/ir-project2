The SEC's decision to retain market-price valuation was controversial because declining oil prices at the beginning of the year forced many concerns using the full-cost method to take large first-quarter write-downs on the value of their reserves.    Under full-cost accounting, oil companies are required to take quarterly write-downs whenever the market value of their oil and gas reserves falls below book value.    The study by the SEC chief economist's office examined stock prices for 204 oil and gas companies. Of those, 162 were full-cost firms and 42 used the successful-efforts method, which doesn't require the automatic write-downs.    The commission's staff concluded that market forces caused oil-company stocks to decline because falling oil prices were expected to reduce earnings, not because the SEC decided to reaffirm an accounting rule that would force some write-downs. </TEXT></DOC>
