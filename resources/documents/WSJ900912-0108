Though it isn't labelled as a wine cooler, Cisco isavailable in a variety of fruity flavors, which theWashington-based consumer groups say may lead buyers toconfuse it with such beverages. But Cisco has analcohol-content level of 20%, higher than many so-called&quot;fortified&quot; wines and much higher than wine coolers, whosealcohol content averages 4% to 5%.</LP><TEXT>   The two groups, the National Council on Alcoholism andDrug Dependence and the Center for Science in the PublicInterest, said they investigated the sale of the product inblack and Hispanic neighborhoods in Washington, where Ciscohas come to be known on the street as &quot;liquid crack.&quot; Thegroups said they will announce details today for a &quot;nationalgrass roots&quot; campaign to force the company to halt sales ofthe product.   Canandaigua denied the consumer groups' charges. &quot;We haveno indication nor evidence in the marketplace that this wineis being mistaken for a wine cooler,&quot; said Marvin Sands,chairman of the Canandaigua, N.Y., wine producer.   Fortified wines, which are made with cheap ingredients andbolstered with alcohol, have long been associated with theshadowy market of low-income alcoholics and indigents. Butthe lobbying groups claim that the Cisco point-of-purchasematerials and the product's packaging may trick ordinaryconsumers who may be looking for a simple wine cooler.   Cisco is pitched in point-of-purchase displays as a brandthat &quot;Takes You by Surprise]&quot; Cisco is sold in two sizes ofbottles with twist caps similar to traditional wine-coolerpackaging.   &quot;We want to tell consumers what kind of product thisreally is and to warn them so there aren't more people whoinadvertently consume it to the detriment of their health,&quot;said Christine Lubinski, director of public policy at theNCADD.   &quot;We believe that these allegations are purely hypotheticaland theoretical,&quot; said Mr. Sands of Canandaigua, which boughtthe Cisco brand from a small Western winery two years ago. Hesaid, for example, that consumers couldn't be confusedbecause Cisco costs 50% more than wine coolers and is soldonly in single bottles, not in packs of four like most winecoolers. What's more, he said, the product isn't advertisedon TV or radio like the other wine coolers.   But officials of the lobbying groups say the complaintsthey've received and their own scouting of Washington-areaconvenience stores suggests Cisco is often priced onlyslightly higher than wine coolers. And it's not uncommon,they said, to find single bottles of wine coolers in therefrigerated &quot;carry-out&quot; section of some neighborhood stores.</TEXT></DOC>
