White   Staff Reporters of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DATE>09/19/90</DATE><SO>WALL STREET JOURNAL (J), PAGE A3</SO><CO>   GM LABOR</CO><IN>AUTOMOBILES (AUT)CDS, INTEREST RATES, COMMERCIAL PAPER (FIN)</IN><LP>   DETROIT -- General Motors Corp.'s new three-year agreementwith the UAW amounts to a massive golden handshake for itsblue-collar workers under which the company will pay $4billion for the right to shrink its U.S. work force.   Details of the proposed pact, which was overwhelminglyapproved yesterday by top UAW leaders, show an elaborate webof provisions aimed at cutting GM's active U.S. blue-collarwork force from its current level of 280,000 people.</LP><TEXT>   Among the pact's features: &quot;pre-retirement leaves&quot; thatallow older workers to leave their jobs at 85% of full-timepay; a reduction in the minimum early-retirement age to 50years from 55 years, richer bonuses for those who agree tosimply quit GM.   In addition, annual pensions for workers under 62 yearsold who retire with 30 years' seniority will rise 20% to$21,600 a year in 1992 from $18,000 a year now. Regularpension benefits will rise 17% under the proposed pact.Lump-sum buy-out payments offered to younger workers who wantto quit GM will be sweetened to a maximum $72,000 from$65,000 now.   All these measures amount to a program aimed atencouraging older workers to leave, analysts said.   &quot;We can expect a considerably smaller work force at GM in1993,&quot; said Harley Shaiken, a labor expert at the Universityof California at San Diego. &quot;There's no question but that thepensions increase was one more mechanism to help shrink thework force.&quot;   That shrinkage could be substantial. While precise figuresweren't available yesterday, the average GM worker is 44years old -- just six years short of the new early-retirementage. By 1995, normal attrition could cut GM's active U.S.labor force to less than 200,000 workers from about 280,000now, according to one internal estimate.   But the new contract could accelerate the normal rate ofattrition at GM. And it could benefit the company, as youngerworkers now on lay-off move into jobs vacated by olderemployees who retire, or take sweetened buy-out packages tosimply quit.   And while GM will pay a high price for gains in efficiencyrelated to a smaller work force, the proposed contract leavesthe company considerable flexibility.   Workers who are currently laid off will get an additionalfinancial cushion -- but not a guarantee of jobs. GM willguarantee 52 weeks of pay at 95% of weekly earnings forworkers with less than 10 years' seniority. Those workers getless than six months of coverage now. Workers with more than10 years' seniority will get up to three years of pay at 95%of their base earnings, compared with two years or less now.   GM can still idle plants if sales fall drastically. Thecatch: It must pay full wages and benefits to workers who arelaid off for more than 36 weeks over the next three years.Workers in this situation would be placed in a &quot;jobs bank,&quot;and be given priority for openings elsewhere in GM's U.S.operations. However, these workers also could be offeredbuy-outs, or early-retirement deals that are now about 17%richer than in the past.   UAW officials said yesterday that the agreement requiresGM to discuss any proposed plant closing with the union. Andthey said the agreement includes a &quot;moratorium&quot; on plantclosings similar to one included in the last pact.   But Stephen P. Yokich, the union's top GM bargainer,declined to say specifically yesterday whether the moratoriumprohibits GM from closing more plants by classifying them as&quot;indefinitely idled&quot; due to market conditions. GM used thisloophole to close four U.S. car factories during the pastthree years. Company officials said they expect GM will goahead with previously announced plans to close two truckplants between now and the end of 1993.   To be sure, there are some measures that will protect UAWjobs, and benefit those who want to stay at GM. Base wageswill rise 3% this year, with 3% lump sum payments in the nexttwo years.   The agreement also gives the union more power to block thecompany from giving work to outside suppliers, a practicecalled &quot;outsourcing.&quot; Under the pact, GM will give the uniondetailed information about the comparative costs of doing thework in-house or sending it to an outside supplier. Theagreement even allows the union to bid on work now being doneby outside suppliers.   Workers affected by outsourcing also will have the rightto take the issue to an arbitrator. GM and union officialssaid the new process won't cause the company to take longerto get products to the market.   Overall, however, the union's apparent willingness toaccept income guarantees and better retirement packages inlieu of jobs reflects a growing realism among UAW officialsas the U.S. auto industry braces for tough economic times andintense competition.   &quot;There's only one form of job security; and that's tobuild a good product that people will buy,&quot; said GeorgeSailer, who represents some 4,300 UAW members at a GM engineparts plant in Toledo, Ohio.   Now that Mr. Sailer and about 400 other UAW leaders fromGM factories around the nation have approved the tentativepact, the package will go to GM's UAW membership, who willvote on it by Sept. 30.   ---                    Pathways Out of GM                                                                                                          The proposed UAW-GM contract expands and sweetens theoptions for workers who want to leave GM, and gives a biggercushion to those who lose their jobs:                                                                                                          &quot;Pre-retirement Leaves&quot; -- Older workers can go on &quot;leave&quot;at 85% of regular pay until eligible for retirement.                                                                                                          30-and-Out -- Annual pensions for workers under age 62 whoretire with 30 years seniority will rise 20% by 1992 to$21,600 from $18,000 now.
