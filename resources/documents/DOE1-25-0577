<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-25-0577 </DOCNO><TEXT>Design, manufacture, and rf adjustment procedures of a prototype 100-MHzradio-frequency quadrupole cavity are described, along with some resultsof experiments made without a beam. The rf voltage amplitude at the electrodeswas measured via the upper edge of the x-ray spectrum. A much simplermethod for measuring the rf voltage with 4% accuracy was establishedby evaluating the dependence of the x-ray intesity on iron shield thicknessand voltage; the first method was used to calibrate the second. The voltagedependence of the electron current emitted by the electrodes was computedfrom measured x-ray dose rates and was compared with the Fowler-Nordheimtheory of field emission. Finally, the breakdown behavior at high fieldstrengths up to 30 MV/m is described; it was found that the breakdownthreshold depends on the pulse length, as well as on previous conditioningor deconditioning, and is approximately 2.5 times the Kilpatrick limit.</TEXT></DOC>
