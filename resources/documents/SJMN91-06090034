It was not just any horse, but one wearinga Giants cap. The fan wrote that the horse has worn that cap for eight years.;   That kind of mail normally would have elicited a &quot;Humm-Baby&quot; and a smilefrom Craig, but his mind was elsewhere as he put the enclosures back into theenvelope. It was Thursday afternoon, and Craig had just heard that pitcherScott Garrelts had been forced to leave a simultaneous split-squad game inPalm Springs after one inning because of shoulder trouble.  </LEADPARA><SECTION>  Sports  </SECTION><HEADLINE>  CRAIG RE-EVALUATING PITCHINGGARRELTS' SETBACK MIGHT REQUIRE S.F. MANAGERTO REALIGN ROTATION  </HEADLINE><MEMO>  BaseballChart attached to the end of this article  </MEMO><TEXT>     Friday morning, the concern was lessened only slightly. Garrelts, who hadbeen an opening-day candidate, had his shoulder X-rayed and also had anelectromyogram (EMG) to look for nerve damage. Results of both tests werenegative but showed inflammation in the rotator cuff. Garrelts was told totake oral anti-inflammatory drugs and do no throwing until a scheduledre-examination Sunday, and Craig suddenly was re-evaluating a pitching staffthat had seemed set.;    &quot;He would be pitching in the San Diego series,&quot; Craigsaid. &quot;But I don't know how that's going to work now. If it gets worse and wehave to disable him, who knows?&quot;;    Garrelts was bothered by shoulderinflammation during a Montreal trip last September. It did not affect hispitching schedule, but he did miss the final two weeks of the season withtendinitis in his right elbow. This had been a quietly smooth spring for him,and he was hoping to get off to something better than the 1-6 record and 6.88ERA he had compiled in his first 11 starts of 1990.;    &quot;As long as it quietsdown fairly quickly, it won't bother me at all,&quot; Garrelts said. &quot;I just hopeit doesn't last long.&quot;;    Before Garrelts' setback, the only mystery forCraig had been over his opening-day starter and his fifth starter, and eventhat was not much of a mystery. John Burkett still has the edge for openingday, and Mike LaCoss for the No. 5 spot. If Garrelts is set back at least forhis first start, then rapidly recovering Don Robinson or Kelly Downs should beavailable to start. If Garrelts is ready for San Diego, then it seems to be apredictable staff that you'd want in a pennant race.;    With Garreltstentatively penciled into the rotation, here is how the 10-man staff shapesup:;    Rotation;  The spring began with a four-man competition for two spots,between All-Rehab Team selections LaCoss, Downs, Robinson and Rick Reuschel.Craig had said he would wait as long as possible to commit either way.;   Reuschel has had a starting job pretty well locked up. Burkett and Bud Black,the team's only present left-handed starter, have been steady in theirexhibition starts. LaCoss went only four innings Friday against Seattlebecause of a shaky fourth, but he had compiled a 1.93 ERA before then.;   Still on the roster is left-hander Eric Gunderson, who figures to open inTriple-A and enter the rotation picture at some point.;    Bullpen; Downs andRobinson figure to be the right-handed middle relievers, because of their slowprogress and the rotation gridlock. But Downs went five strong innings afterGarrelts left in Palm Springs, and Robinson may be one start away from beingcaught up with his &quot;competitors.&quot; Right-handers Mark Dewey and FranciscoOliveras still are on the roster.;    Recent history shows that Trevor Wilsonprobably will start somewhere down the road, but Craig would love to keep himin the left-handed setup role. Wilson is hot, striking out the side in hisonly inning Friday. That followed a strong outing Tuesday in Yuma.;   Right-handed closer Jeff Brantley has progressed well after a slow start, andmost of the recent attention has been on his left-handed cohort, DaveRighetti. He has given up 11 runs in 8 1/3 innings and had difficulty in hislast two appearances.;    Craig said Righetti will start a game today at theminor league camp just to get more work. Righetti has been known as a slowstarter, so this evidently is the norm.;    &quot;I'll probably throw about threemore times and pick (the pace) up a little,&quot; Righetti said. &quot;It's actuallybeen one of my better springs so far. This probably is the first time in yearsI haven't had to back up a day because of tendinitis.&quot;;  PROBABLE ROTATION;There could be sudden changes in the final week of the Cactus League schedule,but here is the Giants' probable starting rotation and the pitchers' 1990stats:; Pitcher       W-L     ERA     IP; Burkett        14-7    3.79    204;Black         13-11   3.58    206; Garrelts      12-11   4.15    182; LaCoss       6-4     3.94    77; Reuschel      3-6     3.93    87  </TEXT><BYLINE>  MARK NEWMAN, Mercury News Staff Writer  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Scottsdale, Ariz.  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910330  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Saturday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  4E  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO; CHART  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  830  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Saturday March 30, 199100090034,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
