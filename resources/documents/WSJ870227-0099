But it acquitted another person and the brokerage firm.    As previously reported, Herbert L. Cantley, the former broker and sales manager, was accused of conspiring with six others to launder, through Shearson accounts, more than $1 million in proceeds from an illegal bookmaking operation. Mr. Cantley and five of the other people also were charged with operating the illegal gambling operation.    Sheldon Shore and Shearson, a unit of American Express Co., were found innocent of all charges. Shearson had been named in the indictment because the government contended other Shearson managers and employees knew about the laundering scheme.    Among the five convicted in the case are Joseph Mastronardo Jr., son-in-law of former Mayor Frank Rizzo, the endorsed Republican candidate for mayor this year. Mr. Mastronardo was convicted on 11 counts of conducting an illegal gambling business, interstate phone calls in furtherance of illegal gambling, conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government and scheming to conceal information.    Mr. Cantley was convicted on six counts. Others convicted on various counts were Mr. Mastronardo's father, Joseph Sr.; his brother, John; and John Hector, a Mastronardo associate who was charged with working in the gambling operation. Mario Scinicariello, who also was named in the indictment, has requested a separate trial.    No sentencing date has been set. Mr. Cantley faces a maximum penalty of 30 years in prison and a $540,000 fine. Joseph Mastronardo Jr. could be sentenced to 55 years and fined $2.5 million. His father, Joseph Sr. faces as many as 25 years in prison and a $1 million fine. John Mastronardo faces as many as 10 years and a $500,000 fine. Mr. Hector could face 15 years and a $750,000 fine. </TEXT></DOC>
