Officials said the case was being investigated as a possibleterrorist attack.   The home of Capt. Will Rogers III, commander of the USSVincennes, was sealed off and he and his wife, Sharon, were inhiding. Officials confirmed the couple received at least onethreatening call about the missile strike on the airliner.   The van remained in the cordoned-off intersection where itexploded and burned Friday, moments after Mrs. Rogers got out whenshe heard a noise witnesses described as ``two loud pops.''   There also was increased security at the several militaryfacilities in San Diego, the nation's largest Navy complex.   The van was the center of intense scrutiny Saturday byinvestigators from the FBI and other federal agencies, who had acommand post set up nearby.   ``We are into an exhaustive, painstaking, lengthy investigationto determine what type of bomb it was, what was used in it, how itwas detonated,'' said Thomas Hughes, agent in charge of the SanDiego FBI office. ``There are fragments ... that would lead one tobelieve this was a pipe bomb.''   However, he said at a briefing Saturday that it had still notbeen determined whether it was a pipe bomb.   Investigators set up barrels covered with sieves and siftedthrough debris collected from the area shortly after Friday'sexplosion. Other investigators swept beds of plants lining theavenue with metal detectors.   The debris will be taken to a lab in Washington. Bomb analystsfrom the Los Angeles FBI office and the Washington FBI explosivesunit were at the scene.   The roofs of buildings in the area also were being searched forany kind of evidence, Hughes said.   ``Teams of investigators are running out just hundreds andhundreds of leads,'' Hughes said.   He said the Rogerses were being kept in a secure location. Theirson, who attends school in upstate New York, was notified andoffered protection, the FBI said.   Hughes declined to comment when asked about a report that a redcar was seen behind Mrs. Rogers' van and made a quick U-turn afterthe explosion.   Rogers, who joined his wife at a nearby police station after thebombing, had driven the van earlier Friday, The New York Timesquoted a Bush administration official as saying.   The couple's home was kept behind a security seal, withauthorities blocking the street so far away that the house was notvisible to reporters.   Three official-looking vehicles with heavily tinted windows wereallowed through the barricade Saturday.   A Justice Department source in Washington who spoke on conditionof anonymity said investigators suspect the bombing was the work ofterrorists. However, local FBI investigators would not confirm thattheory.   ``This could have been perpetrated for some other reason unknownat this time,'' Hughes cautioned.   ``When anything like this happens we're not going to ruleterrorism out, that perhaps this might be a retribution,'' said FBIduty officer Kathy Kennedy in Washington. ``But we're going to lookat all the angles.''   Iran's Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for an all-out waragainst the United States after the Iran Air passenger plane wasshot down.   Some members of the Iranian Reolutionary Guards have entered theUnited States as students, Oliver B. Revell, executive assistantdirector of the FBI, said earlier in the week. He said there was a``hard core'' of 200 to 300 Iranians who were of concern to hisagency.   No White House comment was planned until the FBI completes itsinvestigation, White House press secretary Marlin Fitzwater saidSaturday.   President Bush was ``monitoring the news accounts. He's concernedabout it,'' said another White House official who spoke on conditionof anonymity.   FBI spokesman Michael Kortan said no incidents linked to Mideastterrorists have occurred in this country since 1983, when FBIDirector William Webster said the agency had stopped an attempt byIranians to bomb a Seattle theater occupied by Iranian opponents ofKhomeini's regime. Seattle Mayor Charles Royer said city police wereinformed of the possibility of a threat but ``nothing happened.''   Last July 3, in the Persian Gulf, the guided-missile cruiserVincennes exchanged fire with Iranian speedboats.   During the battle, an aircraft that Rogers thought was an IranianF-14 fighter appeared on the U.S. warship's advanced radar. Afterthe plane failed to respond to warnings on civilian and militarychannels, Rogers gave the order to shoot it down.   The aircraft was actually an Iranian civilian jet with 290 peopleaboard. All aboard were killed.   Rogers later said he regretted the deaths but that his decisionwas made in defense of his ship and crew. He was backed by theReagan administration, which also decided to compensate the victims'families.   Mrs. Rogers received a threatening call last July from someoneshe guessed might have been Middle Eastern, The New York Timesreported Saturday, quoting an unidentified Pentagon official. Thecaller gave her the name of an organization that was unfamiliar toher and said, ``Are you the wife of the murderer?'' frightening Mrs.Rogers into hanging up, the newspaper said.   The Navy found no indication that the named organization existed,the Times said.   An unidentified Justice Department source told The San DiegoUnion that Rogers and his family received at least two telephoneddeath threats from callers who said they were acting in response tothe jetliner's destruction.   The Union said Rogers received one of the calls 24 hours beforethe December bombing of a Pan Am jet over Lockerbie, Scotland. Therehas been speculation on whether that bombing was in retaliation forthe Vincennes' action.   Navy Cmdr. David Dillon, acting as a spokesman for the couple,said Mrs. Rogers received a threatening phone call shortly after theairliner's destruction.   The Vincennes has been at San Diego, its home port, sinceOctober, except for several short training missions, Chief CraigHuebler, spokesman for the San Diego Naval Base, said Saturday.   He confirmed security was tighter at military installations inthe area, but declined to give specifics.   Sen. Pete Wilson, R-Calif., spoke with the Rogerses on Friday.``Mrs. Rogers said, `Thank God this did not happen on Thursday'because she was carrying six children in the van that morning.''
