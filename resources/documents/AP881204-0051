The uprising is the worst threat to President Raul Alfonsin sincehis civilian government replaced a disgraced military dictatorshipin 1983.   The government has refused to negotiate with the rebels. Therebels face loyalist troops led by the army chief-of-staff, Lt. Gen.Jose Dante Caridi, at a suburban Buenos Aires stronghold. Anothergroup near the capital surrendered Sunday, but other troops about 60miles west of the city joined the rebellion.   Alfonsin had wide support to quell the third rebellion in thepast 18 months and pledged to ``suffocate it.''   The Interior Ministry issued a statement saying the governmentwould ``in no way negotiate the positions invoked by the fractiousgroups.''   Authorities used tear gas to repeatedly disperse protesters whothrew rocks and bottles at the arsenal in Villa Martelli, aworking-class neighborhood nine miles from downtown Buenos Aires.   Tens of thousands of people gathered in plazas across this SouthAmerica nation to support a democracy that has suffered six militarycoups since the 1930s.   Rebels are demanding an end to the prosecution of officers forhuman rights abuses committed during the 1976-83 dictatorship,changes in retirements and promotion schedules, and higher wages.   In a communique Sunday from the arsenal, the renegades said theirrebellion is solely a military matter and not ``a crisis .. . thataffects the political power of the nation.''   The 4-million-member General Labor Confederation, the nation'slargest labor coalition, called a general strike for midnight tolast at least 24 hours.   Nearby residents of the arsenal were ordered to evacuate afterthe 35 government tanks and troops moved in.   Official sources estimate the rebels, led by Col. Mohamed AliSeineldin, number about 500 and are backed by at least nine tanks.   On Sunday afternoon, the army announced that other rebelssurrendered at the infantry school at the sprawling Campo de Mayoarmy base, 22 miles northwest of the capital. They were arrested,the army said.   They army did not say how many rebels surrendered or whether theygave up peacefully.   The insurrection began Thursday when 53 members of an elite coastguard unit robbed an arsenal and deserted their base. Also, officerstried to incite troops at two other army bases in suburban BuenosAires.   On Friday, troops at an infantry school rebelled. On Saturday,most of the rebels moved to an army arsenal in the Villa Martellineighborhood 15 kilometers from downtown Buenos Aires.   On Sunday, troops in the 6th infantry regiment at Mercedes, 60miles west of the capital, joined the rebellion, but no furtherdetails were immediately available. The news agency NoticiasArgentinas quoted unidentified army sources as saying 70 rebelsmutinied.   In Buenos Aires, a city of 10 million, its five televisionstations continued broadcasting news, with public messages playingacross the bottom of the screen urging people to defend democracy.   Tanks and men armed with automatic weapons dressed in combatfatigues were featured on front pages of all the Sunday newspapers.TV showed rebels checking land mines, digging trenches, positioningtanks.   At the heavily-fortified Government House, Alfonsin metcontinually with Cabinet ministers and military advisers. At midday,he attended mass in a chapel within the building.   A commission appointed by Alfonsin published a report in November1984 that said at least 8,900 Argentines were arrested by securityforces and ``disappeared'' in a government-backed ``Dirty War''against leftist surversion.   In December 1985, a civilian court convicted nine former militaryjunta members, including former President Jorge Videla, of humanrights abuses. The civilian court trials against other militaryofficials are scheduled to resume soon.   The civilian government, which replaced the dictatorship inDecember 1983, ended revolts in April 1987 and January 1988.</TEXT></DOC>
