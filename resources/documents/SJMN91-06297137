When areporter shouted a question about what he would do Tuesday night, he smiledand shrugged his shoulders, then entered the hospital without making astatement.;   Earlier Tuesday, Turner, 44, a bit unsteady on his feet afterhis captivity in Lebanon, was turned over to U.S. officials in Damascus,Syria.;   &quot;I am happy to be out, finally,&quot; he said in a soft voice at a briefnews conference in Damascus. &quot;I am looking forward to seeing my family andfriends.&quot;;   TURNER, who was held by a pro-Iranian group called the IslamicHoly War for the Liberation of Palestine, was an assistant professor ofcomputer science and mathematics at Beirut University College when he waskidnapped by men posing as Lebanese police officers on Jan. 24, 1987.;   Whenhe was leaving the news conference in Damascus, he stumbled and nearly fellbefore being assisted to a waiting car.;   A military spokesman in Wiesbaden,Cmdr.

But by 1993, the sprawling medical center will beshut down under plans to cut the U.S. military presence in Europe.;   U.S.officials who met with Turner described him as &quot;lucid&quot; and &quot;chatty.&quot; But thereleased American made few public comments, they said, because of his fearthat he might jeopardize the release of the remaining hostages.;   There arenow eight Westerners believed held captive in Lebanon -- four Americans, twoGermans, an Italian and a Briton.;   When Turner was asked if he had knowledgeof other hostages in Lebanon, he looked toward the U.S. ambassador to Syria,Christopher Ross, for guidance, whispered a comment to the diplomat and thendeclined to answer.;   Turner was held at least part of the time with anotherAmerican, Alann Steen. Asked whether he had any information to pass on fromSteen, Turner said, &quot;Not at this moment, no. I want to speak to his wifefirst.&quot;;   Turner also refused to comment on whether he carried a statement ora message from his kidnappers.;   Turner, who had a bushy mustache, neatlycropped hair and wore a double-breasted beige jacket, was turned over toSyrian security forces in the early morning hours of Tuesday in Lebanon.;   Hewas driven to the Syrian Foreign Ministry in Damascus, where he was greeted byboth Ross and Nasser Qaddur, the Syrian minister of state for foreign affairs,at about 9 a.m.;   Two hours later, he boarded a C-141 transport plane enroute to Wiesbaden. He will be joined there by his Lebanese wife, Badr, and adaughter, Joanne, who was born five months after his abduction. Turner alsowill undergo psychological and medical tests and be debriefed by StateDepartment officials.;   U.N. officials and Western diplomats are hopeful thatfurther releases will soon follow as Iran, Lebanese groups and Israel continueto exchange information through the United Nations.;   U.N. officials, seemingbuoyed by the resumption of prisoner exchanges in Lebanon, said they expect toannounce new releases soon.;   Those officials said Turner's release was theoutcome of an &quot;intensive stage&quot; of negotiations between U.N. Secretary-GeneralJavier Perez de Cuellar's special envoy, Giandomenico Picco, and a hostagenegotiator identified as Abu Abdullah, described as the &quot;special envoy of theorganization that holds the hostages.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  New York Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Wiesbaden, Germany  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   911023  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Wednesday  </DAY><MONTH>  October  </MONTH><PG.COL>  2A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  759  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Wednesday, October 23, 199100297137,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
