Manuel Noriega, brought to Miami files they said were &quot;political dynamite&quot; that could affect the U.S. presidential election.    Vice President George Bush's political opponents have been floating rumors for some time that he had some embarrassing links to Gen. Noriega, indicted on drug and racketeering charges by two Florida grand juries. However, there has been no evidence.    A former Noriega aide, Jose Blandon, told a congressional hearing last week that Mr. Bush used the Panamanian ruler to pass a warning to Cuban troops two hours before the Grenada invasion, telling them not to get involved. Mr. Bush denied the charge.    Mr. Bush was director of the Central Intelligence Agency from 1976-77, a period during which Gen. Noriega allegedly was being paid for providing information to the CIA. What's more, the vice president's former chief of staff at the White House and deputy at the CIA, Daniel Murphy, made two trips last year to Panama during which he provided Gen. Noriega with political advice.    Mr. Murphy denied Panamanian opposition charges that he encouraged Gen. Noriega about staying in power if he undertook certain reforms, and denied that he consulted the vice president about either of the trips. He said he met with a member of the vice president's staff before his first visit to Panama. </TEXT></DOC>
