Meantime, rival Capital Cities/ABC Inc. said its ABC television network unit will begin airing March 2 a public-service announcement with Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. In the ad, Dr. Koop will say that barring abstinence, &quot;the use of a condom&quot; is the best protection against acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or AIDS, infection. The network, however, still isn't accepting network condom advertising.    A CBS spokesman said the company's TV stations in New York, Los Angeles and Philadelphia decided yesterday to accept condom ads, while its station in Chicago is still reviewing the matter.    Capital Cities/ABC previously has left the decision to run condom ads with local station managers, but none have decided to run them yet, a spokeswoman said.    National Broadcasting Co., a General Electric Co. unit, isn't accepting network contraceptive advertising. However, it also is allowing local stations to accept condom advertising, but only after 11 p.m. EST, a spokeswoman said. WNBC-TV in New York said yesterday it will begin accepting condom advertising. </TEXT></DOC>
