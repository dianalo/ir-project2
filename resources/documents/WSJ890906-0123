Ex-president Patrick G. King, who denied knowledge of the illicit use of Vernon's funds, was found innocent of 24 other charges against him.    The federal court jury convicted Mr. King of conspiring to defraud Vernon, six counts of making false entries in the thrift's books and six counts of misapplication of funds. He faces a maximum possible sentence of 65 years in federal prison and a $500,000 fine.    Mr. King became the fifth former officer of Vernon Savings to be convicted of charges resulting from the two-year investigation by the Dallas Bank Fraud Task Force. Most of the convictions were the result of guilty pleas. In addition to the officers, one consultant and a former president of a Vernon subsidiary have pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges.    Before joining Vernon Savings in 1983, Mr. King was director of supervision for the Texas Savings and Loan Department, which oversees state-chartered thrifts. He is scheduled for sentencing Nov. 2 by Judge Robert Maloney of Dallas. </TEXT></DOC>
