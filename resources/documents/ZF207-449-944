 Their architecture has beenincorporated into the Definity, with several spanking new enhancements addedin for good measure.andM;Definity architecture employs Universal Port Hardware, based upon existingSystem 75 technology.andP;  Circuit packs furnish eight digital ports per pack andeight or 16 analog ports per pack.andP;  Requiring only the smallest offootprints, universal port hardware is now featured throughout the Definityfamily.andP;  It permits a seamless growth path stretching from the 40-linestart-up Definity Generic 1 all the way to the 30,000-line and up DefinityGeneric 2.andM;1989 also saw the introduction of a Look-Ahead Interflow feature on theDefinity's ACD package.andP;  Interflow enables an ACD call to be redirected to avector of another switch within a private PRI network.andM;Before the call is redirected, the sending switch queries the receivingswitch over the D channel of the appropriate ISDN-PRI tie trunk group.andP;  Ifthe receiving switch is capable of handling the call, it transmits a messageto the sending switch and the call is transferred.andP;  If the receiving switchcan't assume the burden, then the sender can query another switch or takealternative action programmed within its own local vector.andP;  Wow.andM;Also catapulting ATandamp;T into the forefront of the ISDN age is the new ServiceNode Controller (SNC).andP;  SNC is an ISDN Central Office switching applicationthat introduces PRI into Electronic Tandem Networks (ETNs).andM;Explains Charlie Fallon, Definity product marketing manager: &quot;The DefinityGeneric 2 provides network efficiency when used as a tandem within an ETN inan SNC switching arrangement.&quot;andP;  SNC is further evidence of ATandamp;T'slongstanding commitment to the integration of premises and network switchingapplications.andM;Executone Weighs In withandM;Some Impressive NewandM;Software and HardwareandM;For 1989, Executone has enhanced their Isoetec Digital Systems/108 and /228with a number of flexible software offerings.andM;Offered as an option, a dial-by-name feature enables the intended to placeintercom calls simply by dialing &quot;8&quot;, then spelling the name of the calledparty.andP;  The System Directory scans for a match and the call is placedautomatically.andM;In a major advance for the Systems' ACD package, Isoetec six-key phones,single-line phones or OPX extensions can now be used as ACD agents.andP;  The callagents can harness the Systems' ACD capabilities by dialing codes from thekeypad, making the whole process a lot more economical than before.andM;Also high on this year's software agenda is transparent intercom dialing,which allows the intended to place intercom calls and transfer outside callsconnected to another cabinet by punching in a four-digit extension number.andM;An attendant terminal upgrade lets you program function keys on a keyboard tofurnish you with one-button access to your most frequently used features.andO;And a new tap-on extension features permits system interface with recordingdevices, a capability essential for public safety and call centerenvironments.andM;Moving to the subject of hardware, we spy a new single line/OPX station card.andO;The card, which houses eight ports, represents a cost-effective method ofinterfacing single-line phones, voice mail, faxs and the like.andM;A spanking new DSS console boasts 44 buttons and is the size of a mere 17-keytelephone.andP;  Buttons are programmable as DSS keys or feature keys.andP;  And beforewe leave you, let us not fail to mention Executone's new data control module,furnishing six I/O ports for printers and terminals, and their digital voiceannouncer, for use with the Isoetec ACD and auto attendant options.andM;Fujitsu's F9600 -- A GreatandM;Switch Made BetterandM;Fujitsu has developed a set of sophisticated new lodging features for theirflagship F9600 PVX, thus accommodating the growing needs of a burgeoninghotel/motel market.andM;A Front Desk Console is now available, replete with wakeup capabilities, DNDand a message waiting indication.andP;  The Console can also inform the hotelstaff on a room's status -- occupied/vacant, VIP or regular, language codeand the guest's name.andM;Typically placed in the anteroom behind the front desk, Fujitsu's new ServiceConsole is used for displaying the wake-up status of a guest's room, as wellas printing the wake-up call audit report and maid status entries from guesttelephones.andM;Last on Fujitsu's hotel/motel agenda is their Automatic Wakeup with recordedannouncement.andP;  This feature permits a wakeup call to be registered orcanceled from the hotel's attendant console, front desk console, PMS consoleor guest telephone by simply dialing a registration code and the specificmoment the customer has chosen to rise and shine.andP;  The F9600 willautomatically call the guest phone at the time requested with a cheerfulrecorded announcement.andM;Fujitsu has also premiered a new Remote Line Unit (RLU) for the F9600,stretching the distance you can place stations from the F9600 switch.andP;  Thisfeature comes in handy in a campus environment (read University andAerospace) where the intended are spread out over a large area.andM;The RLU can be placed up to five kilometers from the main cabinet.andP;  It isconnected via fiber optic media, and, like all F9600 stations, deliverscompletely non-blocking service.andP;  Redundancy can also be provided on thefiber optic media.andM;New telephone line cards double the density of the digital line card fromeight to 16 devices.andP;  This reduces the number of shelves and cabinets neededto serve the same number of digital phones.andP;  The result -- a smallerfootprint and lower overall power requirements.andM;Hitachi's StomperandM;Hitachi's HCX5000 COMMerce is a brand-new, ISDN-compatible PBX offering astunning array of integrated applications, advanced architecture and a robustline of multifunction station sets.andP;  These systems are geared especially foruse with LANs and digital data services.andP;  And the entire product line sharescommon system architecture, hardware and software, allowing for seamlessmigration.andM;Largely responsible for the HCX5000's awesome data transmission capacilitiesis Hitachi's sper time-switch digital-switching matrix, sending informationat 64 Kbps among 1,024 B-channel time-slots.andP;  The matrix constitutes a trulyfundamental integration of voice and data, since all, count 'em, all of thesignals are transported by the same type of channel.andM;A second major advance incorporated into the HCX5000 is an extremely highdensity of analog and digital line circuits with enhanced capabilities.andM;The system's SelecSet digital line card supports up to 16 (count 'em, 16)simultaneous voice and data ports per board, an astronomical sum unrivalledin the entire PBX market today.andP;  Data capabilities are furnished by DataAdaptors, optional modules which can be snapped onto the base of SelecSetmultifunction telephones for simultaneous voice/data.andP;  The Adaptors cansupport three keyboard dialing protocols -- Hayes, Hitachi and V.25bis, andare much more economical than the usual alternatives -- i.e., smart modems orLAN connections.andM;Total integration has its advantages.andP;  For example, many of the HCX5000'svoice features also extend to data.andP;  Hunting, queuing with callback, accountcodes and access restriction -- all of these features buttress routine datatransmission.andP;  You can even have the blessings of modem pooling work for you,employing either manual or automatic modem selection.andM;Last but not least on the HCX5000 roster of prodigious innovations is a fullline of integrated applications, allowing the switch to serve as a managementsystem as well as a communications hub.andP;  The long inventory of applicationsincludes an ACD, directories, integrated messaging, least cost routing andcall accounting.andP;  Acquire an attached processor and -- bingo -- you have afull-blown voice messaging system or network management interface in yourcorner.andM;They're calling it the Stomper.andP;  All things considered, it's a very fairname.andM;Lanier Fortifies PBXs andandM;Hybrids With SoftwareandM;GaloreandM;Lanier has developed some impressive software options for the Series XXXII-EXPBX and the Series XXXII-e hybrid.andP;  The first of these advances allows theuse of Direct Station Consoles (DSS) with both systems, historically anoffering strictly the province of key systems.andP;  In reality, they're actuallytransporting the advantages of the lower-end of the telecom market into itshighest reaches.andM;Armed with the new software, the intended ones can employ up to eight DSSconsoles on either system, with each console providing 60 function keys.andP;  Andthe intended can use the consoles to assign station appearance, featureappearance, or simply furnish themselves with busy-lamp indication.andM;In another major advance, the two systems can now achieve internal zonepaging through the speakers of compatible Electronic Key Telephones.andP;  Up to17 different paging groups or zones can be furnished under this new feature.andO;Any station can be a member of up to four of these groups.andM;The economic consequences of zone paging are crystal-clear.andP;  They eliminatethe need for such add-on equipment as amplifiers, speakers and zone-pageselectors.andM;We are also pleased to announce that the Series XXXIII-e, a 192-universalport hybrid, can now give you simultaneous voice/data transmission.andO;Asynchronous data can be transported at the rate of 9.6 Kbps, whileasynchronous speeds through at 19.2 Kbps.andP;  This welcome development bringsthe big-system luxury of voice/data to the small- to mid-sized intended.andO;Easy migration to the Series XXXII-EX makes the picture even that much morerosy.andM;Memorex Telex LaunchesandM;the LexarandM;Memorex Telex's new Lexar System 2000 constitutes the company's bid for thehighest end of the PBX market.andP;  The Lexar can handle anywhere from 40 to16,000 lines, or double the 8,000 line-capacity of the flagship Telex 1001.andM;The Lexar System 2000 is made up of three essential components, the Series2001 Communications Controllers, a new line of proprietary digital telephonesand system software.andM;At the switching level, the most innovative feature of the Lexar is ahighspeed digital secondary level matrix, which permits growth from 32 to16,384 ports while retaining the same hardware.andP;  Operation and functionalityare consistent, regardless of system size.andM;The architecture is fully nonblocking, and is capable of handling suchtraffic-intensive applications as Automatic Call Distribution, switched dataand the ever-looming ISDN.andM;Also fairly bursting upon the telecommunications scene is Memorex's new lineof Modular Digital Telephones.andP;  These proprietary instruments permit fieldupgrades for integrated speakerphones, as well as for a variety of datainterfaces.andP;  Options can be added simply by plugging in cost-effectivemodules.andM;An integral part of this series, the Lexar 2000 proprietary option allows forup to two additional analog inputs to be supported from a digital station setover a single digital common equipment port.andM;Also foremost among this year's innovations is Memorex's Integrated AutomatedDirectory System.andP;  The Directory allows bidirectional, interactive operationbetween a PC and the system console.andP;  Calls are handled through theintegration of the PC with the &quot;d&quot; channel of the console, while directorylook-up is supported by name, department or other identifier by direct accessor scrolling.andP;  The Directory even fortifies the message center with secondaryscreens and status messages.andM;You really have to take a look at this directory feature to truly understandits beauty.andP;  It really is nice.andM;Mitel Concentrates onandM;Datasets and NetworkandM;IntegrationandM;Mitel has introduced the Dataset 4100 series for use in the IBM 3270environment, replacing costly coax cable with twisted pair.andP;  The Dataset 4100constitutes the only proprietary instrument for the IBM 3270 environmentcapable of harnessing the Mitel SX-2000 ICS PBX's switching capabilities.andP;  Dowe make ourselves clear?andM;The Dataset 4100 gives the telecom manager a freer hand in designing hisnetwork, allowing the placement of 3270 terminal equipment at any location ona plant or campus.andM;Harness the Mitel Superswitch Digital Networks (MSDN), and you can affectplacement anywhere within the network.andP;  The SX-2000 acts as network trafficmanager for the network, and permits terminals to access more than just onehost computer.andM;The Dataset 4100 also furnishes high-speed, error-correcting datatransmission.andP;  A Mitel Digital Network Interface card enables you to transmitat 64 Kbps through the PBX.andM;Also entering into this year's dataset arena is Mitel's 2200 series.andP;  Theseinstruments give you high-speed (48, 56, 64 Kbps) data transmission throughthe SX-2000 ICS or across the MSDN network.andP;  MSDN also permits T-1transmission among the SX switches.andP;  The Dataset 2200 series provides thisdigital connectivity via a V.35 interface.andM;The SX-2000 is also this year's proud beneficiary of Mitel's new ACD package.andO;The ACD accommodates up to 64 groups and 200 agents.andP;  Four levels of recordedannouncement devices can be used per incoming queue.andP;  And the power ofMitel's inimitable Superset 4 girds the agent position with LCD display forcall status, queue status and call duration.andM;Other stunning ACD perks include make busy, which enables agents to maketheir phones busy when they're indisposed, and modified DND routing, allowinga supervisor to dynamically reassign agent groups during peak periods simplyby dialing the appropriate feature access codes.andM;Northern Telecom Hones ItsandM;ISDN Networking and ACDandM;EdgeandM;Northern Telecom's Meridian SL-1 has taken on new software which enables theintended to implement ISDN capabilities throughout their networks.andO;Introduced at this year's ICA, X11 Release 13 Software has already proved itsworth in new trial runs.andM;Hewlett Packard employed X11 Release 13 to network their Fort Collins andLoveland, CO, installations.andP;  ISDN primary-access links their two MeridianSL-1 XTs, and the sites now can share Meridian SL-1 ISDN features throughoutthe network.andP;  Information on one system is imparted instantaneously to theother, allowing the two nodes to function as one.andM;The network-wide ISDN capabilities improve voice/data integration, as well asimaging capabilities.andP;  Display of name and number is attached to thetelephone set from which the call is made.andP;  And when an employee happens upona busy line, network ring-again allows him/her to request notification whenthat line becomes free.andM;X11 13 software requires a PRI circuit pack and a D-Channel HandlerInterface.andP;  Prices for the software vary according to the size of the PBXsinvolved.andM;Northern Telecom has also performed some serious ISDN wizardry for theMeridian SL-1000, fortifying that family's already prodigious ACD packagewith ISDN-based networking and a management information system.andM;Northern assures us that, girded with the new enhancements, the Meridian ACDis the only ACD available supporting full ISDN-based networking capabilities.andO;These capabilities encompass basic and primary rate access and SignallingSystem 7, allowing interoperability with switching systems used byinterexchange carriers which support them.andM;The new MIS system is nothing to sneeze at, either.andP;  It boasts real-timefull-color displays.andP;  Historical and custom reports can also be generated.andM;Report categories include agent performance, agent log-in and log-out, agentdatabase, route performance and queue performance.andP;  Reports can be regularlyscheduled or made available on demand, and can span interval, shift, day,week or month time-periods.andM;Siemens Girds Saturn withandM;Color ACD, Data and ISDNandM;Siemens has introduced a new ACD package for their Saturn family of PBXs.andO;Dubbed ACD-C, the package expands on Siemens' previous integrated ACDofferings.andP;  It furnishes the call manager with real-time information servedup on an easy-to-read color monitor.andP;  Extensive MIS reports are also theorder of the day.andM;Chief among the new innovations to be found in the ACD-package is an AgentLog-in and Log-off feature.andP;  Log in/Log-off allows the agent to identify hisor herself to the system, enabling the ACD Application Processor to evaluatethat agent's performance in terms of number of calls handled and the actualtime an agent spends dispensing of calls.andM;A Communications Interface to the ACD Applications Processor permits two-wayinformation exchange between the Saturn PBX and the Processor.andP;  And anAvailable/Unavailable key lets agents make themselves available orunavailbale to the system.andM;Also developed for the Saturn PBX is Siemens' new Office Communications III(OC III) software, furnishing the user with seamless voice/data transmission.andM;OC III software drives synchronous data through the system at the rate of 64Kbps, while the asynchronous attain speeds of 19 Kbps.andP;  The OC III alsofurnishes connectivity between computers and your communications network,allows access to multiple hosts and databases, and serves as a bridge betweenuser-group PC LANs.andM;Also still rather fresh off the grill is Siemen's CorNet, which girds theSaturn with Primary Rate ISDN capability.andM;Solid State SystemsandM;Supplements Its Entire SRandM;LineandM;Solid State Systems has supplemented all of its switches -- the SR 96, SR 224and SR 1000 -- with an external clock synchronization capability.andP;  Offerredas a standard feature, this feature furnishes you with the means necessary tomaintain data integrity on your T-1 applications.andM;In the same comprehensive groove, all of Solid State's PBXs are jointbeneficiaries of a new RS-232 port, available with an interface common to allsystems.andP;  The RS-232 port can be used in both inbound and outboundtelemarketing applications, as well as in emergency &quot;911&quot; environments.andM;The SR 1000 has received special treatment this year.andP;  Its MIS package hasbeen upgraded to perform its functions with greter breadth.andP;  A forecastingpackage has also been added, allowing for sophisticated assessments ofpresent and future call environment needs.andM;Chris McCollum, manager of sales engineering at Solid State, predicts that&quot;telemarketing switches will satisfy the needs of many existing businesses,as well as providing a basis for innovative new business.&quot;andP;  Armed with thenew enhancements discussed above, Solid State will doubtless find a ratherprominent niche in the integrated PBX/ACD field.andM;Tadiran Premiers ACDandM;Tadiran built an ACD for its Coral PBX.andP;  The Coral ACD employs an externalPC-based applications processor which is digitally linked to the switchitself, in what Tadiran terms an &quot;external platform&quot; arrangement.andM;Thanks to the Coral's inherent ability to exchange dynamic information withexternal platforms, the ACD can operate in real-time with no affect onswitching system performance, and regardless of configuration or load.andP;  Theplatform types can support as many as 50 agents, and can be mixed by functionor size to achieve the most economical ACD configuration.andM;Color graphics and full reporting capabilities are also in an integral partof this attractive ACD whole.andM;Tadiran has also added a PC-based Attendant Console and an External HotelMotel Property Management system.andP;  Both of these features interface with theCoral via a digital link similar to the one discussed above.andM;The Attendant Console embraces full-color screens jampacked with company andspeed-call directories, searches by first name, surname, department and&quot;remarks/status,&quot; and pink slip messaging, among other exciting capabilities.andO;All stations are capable off assuming the attendant role with any variety ofstation equipment or PC console.andM;The Hotel/Motel package permits external control of the primary switchingsystem for those functions pertinent to Hotel/Motel operations.andO;Checkin/check-out, SMDR with pricing, room status change, wake-up withrecords, housekeeping and the like have been incorporated into the system.andM;Telenova's New Offerings -- ShortandM;and SweetandM;System capacity has been expanded for the award-winning Telenova 1, which nowcan accommodate up to 240 users.andP;  Current Telenova 1 owners will bepleasantly surprised that they can take full advantage of this development,while larger users will now doubtless give the PBX due consideration.andM;A pristine Multi-Station Adapter furnishes constant appearance and directaccess of up to 10 stations and/or line appearances.andP;  The MSA can essentiallyserve as your console in busy coverage situations.andM;Lastly, the Telenova Basic Operation Station Set (or BOSS, if you want to getacronymic about it) was developed over the past year to intermingle extensivecall-processing control with the compact innovative hardware design TelenovaStation Sets have always been famous for.andP;  Praise should also be heaped onthe BOSS's blinding call handling speed, automatic priority set-up of callsand attendant awareness of calls and call status.andM;Telrad Beefs UpandM;The SymphonyandM;Telrad has been busy, busy, busy this year, releasing an integrated VoiceMail/Auto Attendant, and advanced LCR for their Symphony PBX.andM;Dubbed the Speakeasy, the integrated voice mail/auto attendant comes with anumber of innovative capabilities.andP;  For example, the system calls you at anyoutside number you specify to relay your messages to you, thanks to a RemoteMessage Reminder feature.andP;  Group Messaging cuts down on the sometimesstaggering amount of interoffice memorandums served up daily.andM;Our abridged list of the Speakeasy's countless charms also includes internalpaging, mailbox passwords and a system administration terminal.andM;Advanced least cost routing is offered as a standard feature on the Symphony,and provides domestic as well as international routing.andP;  With LCR, the switchautomatically selects the least costly way to send an outbound call.andP;  Thetime of day, day of the week and the destination of the handled call are alltaken into account.andP;  And as rates change, LCR can be programmed to adjust therouting tables.andM;Marked improvements have also been made at the station level.andP;  Two newproprietary instruments have joined Telrad's Key bx family -- the Four ButtonPlus and the Four Button Plus/Speakerphone.andP;  Four Button Plus phones furnishthe intended with four soft keys and 12 fixed feature keys.andP;  They areavailable with a full speakerphone, off-hook voice announce, handsfree reply,on-hook dialing and monitoring.andM;TIE's Morgan ChoosesandM;The Voice Mail RouteandM;Just what the intended ones ordered -- an integrated voice mail/automatedattendant, exclusively for use with TIE's Morgan PBX.andP;  The new 1002integrated system option furnishes voice messaging and the automated positionon the Morgan, while providing constant interaction between the PBX and voiceprocessing system.andM;The compendium of the 1002's integrated features is a lengthy, lofty one.andO;Let us here metion: automated answering; station status indication (e.g.,andO;busy/no answer) on unsuccessful transfers with voice prompted options;message wait lamp indication; single-key voice mailbox log-on; personalgreetings; and direct transfer to voice mailbox -- to give you a temptingidea of what this sytem has to offer.andM;Also introduced into the luxurious Morgan lifestyle for '89 is a set ofextension line appearances.andP;  This option gives multibutton users complete keysystem functionality for inbound call processing, and encompasses callrouting, call hold, voice announce and call retrieval.andP;  It has been geared inparticular for dispatching, customer service and other applications withheavy inbound call handling requirements.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
