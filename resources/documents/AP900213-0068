Hamilton County Common Pleas Judge Fred J. Cartolano ordered theassessments Monday against former Cincinnati Bell Telephone Co.employees Leonard Gates and Robert Draise.   ``You have to be punished,'' Cartolano said. ``I don't think youtwo have that much in assets, but I think you should be made anexample for others.''   A jury found that Gates and Draise had defamed Cincinnati Bell,its parent company Cincinnati Bell Inc., and company supervisorswith their wiretap claims. Jurors awarded $110,000 in compensatorydamages, and said the judge should add punitive damages becauseGates and Draise recklessly disregarded the truth in theiraccusations.   After the jury announced its verdict on Jan. 23, Cartolano saidhe, too, had concluded that Gates and Draise lied.   Cartolano said the law allows him to use punitive damages asboth a punishment and as a deterrent. Although he acknowledged thatthe amount might not be collectible, he added, ``It is not my jobto collect the damages.''   Gates and Draise testified Monday that they are out of work,deeply in debt, and have only a few hundred dollars in availablecash. During their eight-week trial they represented themselvesbecause they said they could not afford lawyers.   The two men claimed they wiretapped more than 1,200 telephonesbetween the early 1970s and 1984 on orders from Cincinnati policeand Bell security supervisors James West and Peter Gabor.   They claimed the taps were placed on the phones of variouscommunity leaders, reporters, criminal suspects, a federal judgeand President Ford during a 1975 visit.   Several past and present police officers admitted using the twomen for about a dozen illegal taps in the early 1970s.   But the police said Bell supervisors were not involved. Bell,West and Gabor denied any knowledge or participation in suchactivities.   Phone company lawyers contended the two men were seeking revengebecause Bell fired Draise in 1979 and Gates in 1986.   Bell spokeswoman Cynthia Cantoni said the company was pleasedwith the judge's ruling, and that the fact that damages wereassessed was more important than the dollar amounts.   Gates and Draise stuck by their stories and said they areraising money to pay for an appeal.   ``We are not surprised at anything. ... The public knows thewiretapping happened,'' Gates said.   Several alleged victims of wiretapping are suing police and thecity of Cincinnati. The case is scheduled to go to trial Feb. 20 inU.S. District Court.</TEXT></DOC>
