Platinum was the major loser, with the July contract closing near its lows of the day, at $567.60 an ounce, down $15.l0. Silver for September delivery recovered from a drop to as low as $7.05 an ounce to settle at $7.1180, for a loss of 17.7 cents.    Gold, which for some time has shown the smallest movement of the precious metals, attracted some buying late in the day by traders who had previously sold short. The buying interest allowed the August delivery contract to trim an earlier decline and end at $453.00 an ounce, for a loss of $2.40.    A stronger dollar tends to reduce inflation fears by holding down prices for imported products. Precious metals are often held as inflation hedges.    The Toronto meeting of the seven major industrial nations has left an impression that &quot;it will be all right for the dollar to become stronger,&quot; according to Richard Hirsch, vice president and metals broker for Gerald Commodities Inc., New York.    &quot;As a result, the dollar and the stock and bond markets boomed and precious metals plunged,&quot; he said. &quot;Platinum, the major loser, pulled down gold and silver,&quot; he added.    Steven Platt, senior analyst for Dean Witter Reynolds Inc., Chicago, observed that &quot;the strong dollar shook out weak longs in gold and silver.&quot; Also, he said, some overseas traders appeared to be getting out of their own currencies and into precious metals at the lower levels. &quot;This provided support on setbacks,&quot; he said.    Another analyst attributed the weakness in precious metals to the fact that &quot;the prospect of inflation isn't being generated by any other market but the grains and soybeans, and that isn't proving (to be) enough.&quot;    According to John Norris, director of precious metals trading at Citibank, New York, labor troubles in South Africa also contributed to the late comeback in precious metals.    Talks between the National Union of Mineworkers and the Chamber of Mines have been taking place over the past month, according to analysts. The discussions affect 200,000 gold and coal mine workers, an analyst estimated. Peter Bunkell, spokesman for the chamber was reported to have indicated that the talks had broken down.    According to one analyst, this means the process has moved to a second stage at which the union can now formally declare a dispute. This, the analyst said, is part of the legal process that can eventually lead to the declaration of a strike.    The chamber of mines has offered miners a wage increase of 12 1/2% to 16 1/2%, and the union countered with a demand for 22%, but it wasn't indicated what period of time the wage hikes would cover, the analyst said.    Also contributing to yesterday's weakness in precious metals, the analyst said, was the fact that demand from the Far East and Europe has &quot;turned dead&quot; for precious metals in the cash or physical market.    In other commodity markets yesterday:   ENERGY: Prices closed higher as traders turned their attention away from the excess of crude to the tightness of refined products. A fire at a Citgo Petroleum Corp. refinery in Lake Charles, La., as well as the worsening tie-up of barge shipments on the Mississippi and Ohio rivers, pushed spot and futures prices for gasoline higher. As a result of low water levels, docks near Memphis used by Sun Co.'s Sun Pipe Line unit and Mapco Inc. had to suspend operations temporarily. But the continuing heavy supplies of crude -- as well as the ample nationwide stocks of gasoline reported late Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute -- continued to weigh on the market, restraining yesterday's gains. Indeed, Paul Mlotok of Salomon Brothers Inc., one of the more bullish oil analysts on Wall Street, yesterday retreated from his earlier forecast that oil prices would average $19 a barrel in 1988, and predicted a figure of $17.75 a barrel.    SUGAR: Futures prices closed slightly higher after recovering from an earlier decline. October delivery sugar ended at 10.98 cents a pound, for a gain of 0.06 cent. According to a sugar dealer, profit-taking in sugar depressed prices early in the session as people who also trade soybeans had to generate funds to comply with an increase in margins, or good-faith money, in soybeans. However, he noted, dealers and other professionals began buying contracts at around 10.75 cents, sending the October price as high as 11.03 cents. At that point, selling reappeared and prices again softened somewhat, but speculative demand developed toward the close and enabled the October contract to end higher.    GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Grain and soybean futures prices ended mixed to mostly higher as the markets continued to be driven by drought worries. Profit-taking and predictions of scattered showers in a few areas of the Midwest led to selling in certain soybean futures contract months, traders said. But the trend in all the markets is upward unless drenching rains are just over the horizon -- an event that's given a very low probability by most weather forecasters. Oat futures rose to close at the top of their daily permissible limit, reflecting the perilous condition of the nation's oat crop, which is among the hardest hit of all grains. Wheat futures closed lower on profit-taking and due to the fact that much of the current crop already has been harvested. Corn futures were mostly higher as crop yield estimates continue to be reduced in the face of sustained hot and dry conditions. Soybean futures opened sharply lower in most contracts as some traders locked in profits earned in the recent rally, and as others reacted to overnight rains in certain areas. But the daily losses were sharply narrowed in late trading, indicating drought psychology once again dominated the soybean trading pit. The Chicago Board of Trade said that because of the number of limit moves in its agricultural contracts, it has petitioned the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to reduce from two days to one day the period in which contracts trade at their limits before those limits are expanded. </TEXT></DOC>
