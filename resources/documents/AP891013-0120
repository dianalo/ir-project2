(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Young andamp; Rubicam, one of the nation'slargest advertising agencies, pleaded innocent Friday to charges itpaid nearly $1 million in bribes to Jamaican officials for theisland's lucrative tourism campaign.   Two of the company's executives and a former executive alsopleaded innocent Friday in U.S. District Court.   Two Jamaicans charged with accepting the bribes, former Ministerof Tourism Eric Anthony Abrahams and Arnold Foote Jr., were not incourt.   Arrest warrants were issued for the two, but have not beenserved, said U.S. Attorney Stanley Twardy Jr. The U.S. governmentwill begin extradition proceedings against them because theyhaven't surrendered voluntarily, he said.   Jamaica's attorney general, Carl Rattray, told the GreenwichTime newspaper in a telephone interview Friday that he saw nobarriers to extraditing Abrahams and Foote.   ``Usually we cooperate as much as possible,'' Rattray said. ``Idon't think there would be a problem.''   Abrahams' lawyer Abe Dabdoub has denied that Abrahams receivedkickbacks for awarding the tourism board's account to Young andamp;Rubicam.   The case was poorly investigated ``with malice in mind,''Dabdoub said. Abrahams held the post from 1981-84. He is now atourism consultant for several Caribbean countries, including Haiti.   Foote, now president of the Advertising Agencies Association ofJamaica, says he was never a government official or adviser, anddenies that illegal payments were made.   Young andamp; Rubicam faces up to $7.5 million in fines if it isconvicted. Young andamp; Rubicam still holds the Jamaica account, whichwon praise for its theme ``Come Back to Jamaica,'' and hasvigorously denied any wrongdoing.   ``We will be pressing for an early trial date, so we can presentour evidence and get this matter resolved,'' said Young andamp; Rubicamin a statement. ``We expect to be found innocent.''   The New York-based agency, along with Executive Vice PresidentArthur R. Klein and former Vice President Thomas Spangenberg, wereindicted last week on charges of racketeering and conspiracy toviolate the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Steven M. McKenna, acompany senior vice president, was charged with perjury.   The Jamaicans were both charged with racketeering.   The case is believed to the first attempt to use theRacketeering Influence Corrupt Organizations Act against anadvertising agency.   The indictment alleged that Young andamp; Rubicam paid $900,000 inbribes to Foote and Abrahams over 5{ years starting in 1981. Inreturn, the indictment alleged, Young andamp; Rubicam got the JamaicanTourist Board's ad account, which prosecutors say generated $3.75million in commissions for the agency.   The government alleged that the payments were funneled toAbrahams through a sham advertising agency set up by Foote that hadsecret bank accounts in the Cayman Islands.   The indictment said Foote should be considered a public officialbecause he ``acted in an official capacity'' on behalf of Abrahamsas an advisor to the Jamaican government on tourism matters,including the selection of an advertising agency for the JamaicaTourist Board.   Young andamp; Rubicam, which called the charges ``without substance ormerit,'' acknowledges it made payments to Ad Ventures, a companycontrolled by Foote. The agency says Ad Ventures provided variousservices for the Jamaican account, and maintains it had no reasonto believe that Foote could be considered a public official underthe Foreign Corrupt Practices Act.   ``Young and Rubicam made very simple, conventional, legitimatebusiness arrangements in Jamaica. There is absolutely nothing wrongwith it,'' Thomas D. Barr, the agency's lawyer, said after thearraignments Friday.   The government's entire case, built during a three-yearinvestigation, depends on its characterization of Foote as a publicofficial, which the company will challenge, he said.   The Jamaica investigation stemmed from an unrelated probe ofillegal tax shelters. Best-selling novelist Robin Moore, author of``The French Connection'' and ``The Green Berets,'' pleaded guiltyhere to tax charges in the tax probe, and cooperated with federalinvestigators when they turned their attention to the Jamaicadealings.   Moore, whose business dealings in Jamaica date back 40 years, isdescribed in the indictment as a middleman who helped steer theJamaica account to Young andamp; Rubicam and then helped pass moneybetween the agency and Foote.   Twardy said Moore profited from the dealings but will not becharged.   U.S. Magistrate F. Owen Egan set bond at $10,000 for the threeexecutives and told them they must notify the court beforetraveling outside the United States. The case has been assigned toU.S. District Judge Peter C. Dorsey.</TEXT></DOC>
