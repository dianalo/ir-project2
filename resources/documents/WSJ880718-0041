A special feature of universal policies is that holders can vary the premiums they pay each year. But under the measure agreed to by the House Ways and Means Committee, insurance industry officials say, a very large payment in the first several years of a policy would negate the tax-free status for policy loans taken years later.    &quot;A great deal of care is going to have to be taken (by insurers) to warn universal policyholders&quot; of the potential problem, says Thomas Stapleton, senior vice president and tax director for Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., New York. </TEXT></DOC>
