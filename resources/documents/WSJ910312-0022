Buddy Roemer ofLouisiana switched to the Republican Party as part of hisfight to win re-election this year.   Gov. Roemer, a former member of Congress, has beencriticized for raising the state's taxes and for vetoing astringent anti-abortion bill during his first term asgovernor. His party switch is seen as an effort to head offGOP challengers who could erode his generally conservativebase of support.</LP><TEXT>   Gov. Roemer asserted that his brand of politics fits thatof the Republicans, who he said are &quot;becoming most open tonew ideas, new thinking, new people.&quot; Democrats were outragedby the switch. &quot;Political parties aren't like shirts, to bechanged when it's convenient or politically advantageous,&quot;said Sen. John Breaux (D., La.).   The governor's race already is crowded with Democrats,including former Gov. Edwin Edwards and Public ServiceCommissioner Louis Lambert. Republican state Rep. David Dukealso is expected to run, though the party has shunned himbecause of his past association with the Ku Klux Klan.   Mainstream Republican politicians who are possible rivalsof Gov.
