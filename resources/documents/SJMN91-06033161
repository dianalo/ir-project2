I think it has to dowith the fact that Joseph was a carpenter,&quot; said Judi Kaczmarski, manager ofWatra Church Goods Co. in Chicago.;    The practice seems to be so prevalentin the Bay Area, however, that some religious supply stores apparently havetrouble keeping St. Joseph statues in stock.;    Enter the Inner CircleMarketing Co. of Modesto, a wife-and-husband company formed to market the &quot;StJoseph: Underground Real Estate Agent&quot; kit. The kit, which sells for $8,consists of a plastic statue of the saint, a bag to carry it in and a set ofinstructions.;    The instructions claim that the practice of burying thesaint's image to hurry real estate sales began &quot;hundreds of years ago&quot; inEurope where &quot;nuns prayed to St. Joseph (patron saint of the family andhousehold needs) when they needed more land for their convents.&quot;;    The drillfor using the kit, according to the company, is to bury the statue, ask thesaint's help in the sale, then promise to put the statue in a place of honorwhen escrow closes. The statue, the instructions say, should be buried &quot;6inches deep near the 'For Sale' signpost on the selected property.&quot; And, theysay, it should be buried &quot;head first, feet toward heaven, so he faces thedirection of the street.&quot;;    Included in the instructions are these words tobe said while placing the saint in the ground:;    &quot;Oh, St. Joseph, guardianof household needs, we know you don't like to be upside down in the ground,but the sooner escrow closes, the sooner we will dig you up and put you in aplace of honor in our new home. Please bring us an acceptable offer (or anyoffer!) and help sustain our faith in the real estate market.&quot;;    The wholething, the instructions say, is designed so &quot;all persons involved in theburial process. . . have fun at this, but a little reverence is alsorecommended.&quot;;    &quot;We started in business here in December,&quot; said Inner Circleco-owner Karin Reenstierna, &quot;and since then we've sold 3,000 or 4,000, mostlyto Realtors.&quot; She said the bulk of the sales are in the Bay Area, but that thecompany is doing business nationwide.;    &quot;We're not Catholics,&quot; she said. &quot;Asa matter of fact, we heard about St. Joseph the first time from a friend whosaid her Methodist mother in Wisconsin buried a statue and her house sold intwo weeks. It's perceived as sort of faddish out here, but it's been going onfor years on the East Coast.&quot;;    And she said she does believe burying thestatue helps.;    &quot;We keep track of success stories,&quot; she said, &quot;and I guessthe record is a house in Modesto that sold within an hour of burying thestatue. But there have been several homes that have been vacant for months andsold the weekend St. Joseph was buried.&quot;;    She also says that so far, therehave been few negative responses. &quot;We had two phone calls from Realtors,that's it, and one of them changed her mind after we talked.&quot;;    Reenstiernasaid the St. Joseph project is a first marketing effort by her and herhusband, Phil Cates. Cates is in the mortgage business in Modesto; she waspersonnel manager of the same company. She says she has contacts with amanufacturer &quot;back East&quot; that can supply 10,000 statues a month if needed.;   IF YOU'RE INTERESTED;  St. Joseph kits can be ordered by calling (800)326-9183, or by sending a check or money order to Inner Circle Marketing, P.O.Box 577622, Modesto 95357.
