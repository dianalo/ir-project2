One of the important new development activities is thatof small plants incorporating passive safety features. The small plantshave the merits in terms of low total capital requirement and potentiallyshort lead time. The Electric Power Research Institute sponsored thedevelopment of an advanced LWR plant in a nine month Westinghouse program,which terminated in March, 1986. Further development at Westinghouseis now in progress on this design called AP 600 under the sponsorshipof the U.S. Department of Energy. On the basis of the proven 600 MWePWR plant design, the specific design improvement for increased safetyand operational margin, reduced plant capital and operating cost, simplifiedplant systems and components, and increased certainty of meeting constructionschedule and cost is pursued. The Westinghouse two-loop plants are verycompetitive, and the operating performance is outstanding by the comparisonof plant capacity factor. The operation and maintenance costs are low.The specific design and the features of modification and improvementare discussed. (Kako, I).</TEXT></DOC>
