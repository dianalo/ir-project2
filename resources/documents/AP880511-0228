(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The defense attorney for Carlos LehderRivas charged Wednesday that prosecutors used ``bought witnesses''who were promised reduced sentences or other favors for testifyingagainst the reputed Colombian drug lord.   In closing arguments at Lehder's cocaine-smuggling trial,defense attorney Edward R. Shohat said the chief prosecutionwitness got ``the break of a lifetime'' for his testimony againstLehder.   By agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors, convicted smuggler EdWard was able to reduce a possible 215-year sentence and $5.9million fine to less than six years in prison, Shohat said.   ``Boy, did he put it over on the government,'' said the defenseattorney.   He charged that Ward lied to the grand jury that indicted Lehderin 1981 and that he again committed perjury in Lehder's trial. Manyother prosecution witnesses also received deals from prosecutors inexchange for testimony, he said.   Lehder, 38, and co-defendant Jack Carlton Reed, 57, are on trialin federal court on charges they conspired to smuggle some 3.3 tonsof cocaine into the United States from Colombia via Lehder'sprivate Bahamian island, Norman's Cay, from 1978 to 1980.   A separate Miami indictment accuses Lehder of being one of theleaders of the so-called Medellin cartel, a violent smuggling ringbelieved to be responsible a large share of the cocaine enteringthe United States.   Lehder was captured in February 1987 at a mansion near the townof Medellin after a shootout between Colombian army troops and hisbodyguards. He was immediately whisked onto a U.S. Air Force planebound for the United States.   The prosecution called 115 witnesses in the trial, which beganwith jury selection last October. Last week, defense attorneyssurprised the courtroom by announcing that they would be calling nowitnesses.   Closing arguments were expected to continue through Thursday andthe jury may get the case Friday.   Winding up his prosecution arguments Wednesday, U.S. AttorneyRobert Merkle referred to testimony that Lehder used bribes, charmand threats to run a smuggling empire. For once, Merkle said,Lehder couldn't use such tools.   ``He cannot buy his way out of a just verdict. He cannot charmhis way out of a just verdict. And he cannot force his way out of ajust verdict,'' Merkle said.   A day earlier, Merkle told the jury that Lehder was waging aviolent war against the United States and viewed cocaine as aweapon. ``He's still at war,'' Merkle said.   In his defense arguments, Shohat told the jury that the judgewould instruct them that they should consider the testimony ofconvicted felons with special care.   ``Boy, do we have convicted felons here!'' he said.   He argued that many of the government witnesses were givenimmunity from prosecution, hoping for reduced sentences or sometype of deal in return for their testimony.   ``The government brought in 29 bought witnesses,'' he said.``They paid an incredible price to get Mr. Lehder's conviction.''   He also argued that much of the testimony did not concern thecharges contained in the indictment.   ``The issue is not whether Mr. Lehder was good or bad,'' Shohatsaid. ``The issue in this case is the 11 counts in the indictment.''   As an example, Shohat cited the days of testimony concerningpossible payoffs to officials in the Bahamas, including allegationsthat Prime Minister Lynden O. Pindling had taken bribes. Pindlinghas called the allegations ``a fantasy.''   ``Lynden Pindling is not on trial here in this case. CarlosLehder is on trial,'' Shohat said. The payment of bribes toBahamian officials, he said, ``is not an issue in this case.''   Lehder is charged with conspiracy, possession of cocaine withintent to distribute, importation of cocaine and operating acontinuing criminal enterprise.   Co-defendant Reed, of San Pedro, Calif., is charged withsmuggling conspiracy.</TEXT></DOC>
