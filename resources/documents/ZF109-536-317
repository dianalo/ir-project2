Moore, director of NFC's IRM Division.andO;&quot;But the payroll systems don't care whether an employee works two days or 10,the processing is the same.&quot;andM;Under the worst-case scenario, if NFC had to cut its personnel, Moore saidthe center would keep on critical staff to operate the government's payrolland personnel systems.andM;At some agencies where contractors operate many of the systems, officialswere expecting to feel relatively little impact from any budget crises.andP;  Forexample, Immigration and Naturalization Service special agent Neville Cramersaid he expects work on the Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlementssystems to go on unchecked because it is handled by contractors.andM;Top INS officials, however, instructed the staff not to indicate to vendorshow contracts might be affected or make any promises about future operations,he said.andM;Under a work stoppage, for many IRM managers the issue comes down to whethera service is essential or not.andP;  The Office of Management and Budget has leftthat mostly up to the individual agencies.andP;  More than one federal ADP manageracknowledged that there is no clear definition of what is or is not anessential operation.andM;One high-ranking Pentagon official's comments pointed up the irony of thissituation.andP;  &quot;Defense ADP facilities will have to follow the same rules aseveryone else&quot; and close down unless marked essential, the official said.andO;But when asked how the Pentagon would decide which ADP operations wereessential, the official said bluntly, &quot;I have no idea.&quot;andM;For most IRM managers across government, it's a decision they hope they neverhave to make.andP;  And more than one employee summed up the situation in commentsresembling this one:  &quot;We're not an actor in this thing; we're acted upon.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
