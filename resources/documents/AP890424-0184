The three were caught in a Paris hotel room with an Americanbusinessman and a Paris-based South African diplomat whilepurportedly delivering parts of a British Blowpipe missile to theSouth African.   The shoulder-fired Blowpipe, sometimes compared to the U.S.-madeStinger, weighs about 45 pounds and fires 76mm guidedsurface-to-air missiles.   Press Association, the British domestic news agency, quotedgovernment sources as saying concern existed over the possibilitythat South Africa supplied arms to the extremists in return forinformation about the missile, which is manufactured in Belfast.   The Northern Ireland trio _ Noel Little, 40; Samuel Quinn, 41and James King, 50 _ and the American, Douglas Bernhart, werecharged in Paris on Sunday with illegal transport and possession ofarms and terrorist conspiracy, British officials said Monday,speaking on condition of anonymity.   Daniel Storm, a South African Embassy staff member in Paris,claimed diplomatic immunity and was released after briefquestioning.   The Northern Irish, who are British subjects, were held incustody, a British Embassy spokesman in Paris said. The American,described in some British reports as a Swiss-based ``armsadviser,'' was also ordered held, the Paris newspaper Liberationreported Monday.   In Dublin, the government announced its own protest to the SouthAfricans after Irish Foreign Minister Brian Lenihan studied areport sent from the Irish Embassy in Paris.   He also said he was seriously concerned at the ability ofProtestant paramilitaries to obtain weapons and sensitive militarymaterial in Northern Ireland.   Gerald Kaufman, foreign affairs spokesman of the oppositionLabor Party, asked Howe to consult with other European foreignministers for united action to expel all South African intelligenceagents and arms purchasers ``posing as diplomats.''   Kaufman said South African weapons already were used in killingsin Northern Ireland's sectarian conflict and South African grenadeswere thrown at police in the province. Howe said he could not``offer any concluded judgment on that today.''   Howe said South African Ambassador Rae Killen was called in andtold of the ``grave view taken by the British government.''   Howe said he could not confirm a suggestion by lawmaker MenziesCampbell that South Africa was apparently ready to pay $1.7 millionfor a Blowpipe missile.   ``It goes without saying that the South African authorities areprepared to go to very considerable lengths to try to outwit theUnited Nations arms embargo'' on South Africa, he said.   South Africa, under international arms embargo because of itsracial segregation policies, has developed its own sophisticatedarms-manufacturing capacity. British news reports say the SouthAfricans agreed to supply multimillion-dollar small-arms shipmentsor money to the Protestant extremists in return for blueprints ofsophisticated British missiles, which Armscor, the South Africanstate arms manufacturer, would then copy.   In Pretoria, South Africa, Foreign Minister Pik Botha andDefense Minister Magnus Malan said Monday that the South Africangovernment is not supplying arms to any terrorist organization butmust consider offers of weapons technology because of the armsembargo.   One London newspaper, The Independent, ran a front page storyMonday saying South Africa delivered a major arms shipment toProtestant militants in Northern Ireland in January in return forBlowpipe technology.   The Independent, quoting unidentified police sources, said SouthAfrican arms were used by a Protestant who attacked an IrishRepublican Army funeral in March last year, killing three people.   The Independent and other London newspapers said that in returnfor the arms, the Protestant extremists promised blueprints ofmissile technology.   Short Brothers, the state-owned manufacturer of the Blowpipe,reported several thefts in recent months. Belfast police also saida display model of a Blowpipe, without working parts, was stolenfrom a British army center in Newtownards, County Down, this month.   The arrested Protestants belonged to Ulster Resistance, ashadowy organization formed in 1986 in opposition to an Anglo-Irishaccord granting the Irish government a say in Northern Ireland'saffairs on behalf of the province's Catholic minority.</TEXT></DOC>
