In its complaint, the AMR Corp. unit charged that British Airways refuses to list the flights of certain U.S. carriers in Travicom and won't allow users of American's computer reservation system, called Sabre, to issue British Airways tickets in the United Kingdom. The inability to issue British Airways tickets makes Sabre of limited use to U.K. travel agents who use the system, American said.    Travel agents use computer reservation systems such as Sabre and Travicom to book reservations and issue tickets and boarding passes.    American asked the department to allow U.S. computer reservation systems to discriminate against British Airways flights; to prohibit the issuance of British Airways tickets on U.S. computer reservation systems; and to prevent British Airways from pursuing a joint marketing agreement with United Airlines until British Airways resolves the matters raised by the complaint.    Last October, American sued British Airways in the U.K.'s high court and filed a complaint with the European Community Commission for Travicom's alleged abuses of market power. British Airways has said it would &quot;vigorously refute&quot; the allegations in the lawsuit and the complaint. </TEXT></DOC>
