He then returned to this Britishcolony, safe in the knowledge that he could run his businessunimpeded by worries about his future.   Or so he thought. The trouble is, everyone else now seemsto have the same idea. And the scramble for foreign passportsis making Mr. To's business life miserable.</LP><TEXT>   Mr. To, the 38-year-old managing director of HutchisonWhampoa Ltd.'s China-trade division, says every one of hismanagers has left or plans to leave. Though he believes thatlocal people can better handle China business, he is forcedto hire expensive expatriates to fill the openings.   Emigration is nothing new for Hong Kong families, many ofwhom -- including Mr. To's parents -- fled to the colony toescape communist rule in China. The rate began rising sharplyin 1986, in the wake of the British-Chinese agreement forChina to resume sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997. Just asthat flood appeared to be ebbing in 1989, Chinese troopsopened fire on their countrymen June 4.   The bloody suppression of student-led demonstrations inBeijing and doubts about the colony's future constitution arewidely viewed as having encouraged this year's expectedrecord number of departures from Hong Kong. The governmentestimates that about 55,000 people will emigrate this year --many of them trained professionals with marketable skillsabroad -- up from 42,000 in 1989.   &quot;June 4 and what has followed changed a lot of people'sviews,&quot; says a banker. &quot;All of the assumptions for the nextdecade are gone.&quot;   That is creating huge problems for this capitalistcolony's business sector.   One example is Bank of East Asia Ltd. Last year, K.M.Chan, the head of the bank's finance and investmentsubsidiaries, resigned to go to Canada. Mr. Chan had groomeda successor -- but he also quit, to take a more lucrative jobas a securities regulator. Mr. Chan's job ultimately went toan accountant who had been with the bank for only threeyears.   Vacancies are being created as more people move from onejob to another in Hong Kong. Some people are changing jobsfor more money, others to increase their chances of obtaininga foreign visa.   Mignonne Cheng achieved both goals. After 18 years in HongKong with Chase Manhattan Bank, where she was a middle-levelexecutive, Ms. Cheng left in February to join BanqueNationale de Paris in Hong Kong. She received a substantialraise, a guaranteed bonus and a promise of a French passport.   &quot;We can no longer count on replacing people within theHong Kong market,&quot; says the head of a multinational company'slocal office. &quot;And because people are talking to each otherabout emigration instead of talking to the clients, there's aloss of productivity.&quot;   Managers are devoting more time to recruiting and internalrestructuring. The loss of experienced personnel is reducingefficiency. And because wages are rising faster than profits,many companies are seeing their profit margins shrink.   &quot;The brain drain and rising costs are forcing people toreconsider whether they should be in Hong Kong,&quot; says MarkMichelson, an executive at Business InternationalAsia/Pacific Ltd., a consultant to multinational companies.&quot;It doesn't mean a lot of companies are moving, but more arethinking about it.&quot;   To be sure, Hong Kong isn't the only Asian city facing ashortage of skills; companies throughout the region arecomplaining of how staffing problems are blocking expansion.&quot;There's a short supply of people wherever you go in Asia,&quot;says John Chua, managing director of Asia-Pacific operationsfor U.S.-based software-maker ASK Computer Systems Inc.&quot;That's a reflection of the boom times out here.&quot; Still, theproblems facing Hong Kong's companies are unique.   Because of the limited capacity of other countries toaccept Hong Kong residents, annual emigration probably neverwill represent more than a fraction of Hong Kong's 5.7million population. Even so, the flow of departures isdamaging because so many of the emigrants are skilled.   &quot;The work force of any economy is enhanced by the talentof its managers,&quot; says Simon Murray, Hutchison Whampoa'smanaging director and a member of Honour Hong Kong, a groupof businesses and professional organizations trying torestore confidence in the colony. &quot;If there's an erosion ofthat talent, then there's an erosion of the product.&quot; Arecent study by Price Waterhouse Management Consultants saysthat emigration could slow the growth of Hong Kong's economyby as much as 45% by 1997.   &quot;Clearly, {emigration} figures are serious, and I wouldnot wish to pretend otherwise,&quot; says Donald Tsang, thegovernment's director of administration. &quot;But they must beput in perspective.&quot; Aside from the fact that other countrieslimit immigration, Mr. Tsang says Britain's plan to offer theright of abode to 50,000 skilled Hong Kong professionals andtheir families will keep a brake on emigration.   Many businessmen don't expect Britain's offer -- whichfaces an uncertain future in Parliament -- to stabilize theoutflow. China says it won't recognize foreign passports asprotection for ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong. Nor arebusinessmen consoled by the Hong Kong government's promise toproduce more university graduates to offset the brain drain.   The business executives say there is little hope ofresolving the immediate consequences of rising emigration:the loss of experienced personnel, an increasing number ofmistakes caused by their inexperienced replacements and lostbusiness opportunities because knowledgeable executives areleaving. The situation is compounded by the prospect of yearsof unstable management and falling profits resulting from theneed to raise wages and increase training.</TEXT></DOC>
