Thomas C. Theobald, Continental's chairman and chief executive officer, confirmed in an interview Friday that he has been exploring, as an alternative, the possibility of leading a buy-out of the agency's controlling stake. Raising the money, which could total as much as $750 million, wouldn't be a problem, Mr. Theobald said. &quot;There are enough people who are attracted by the possibilities of the situation,&quot; he said, &quot;that it doesn't appear to be a problem.&quot;    For now, it seems the FDIC will soon try to launch a public offering of its Continental shares. Last week's 150% dividend boost and proposed one-for-four reverse stock split by Continental were designed to make such an offering more appealing to institutional investors.    However, the stock market remains jittery. The proposed offering would be huge -- as high as $500 million. And the FDIC doesn't appear willing to accept a price much lower than the current market price. Continental shares closed Friday at $5.25, unchanged, in New York Stock Exchange composite trading.    What's more, no single buyer, such as another bank holding company, has emerged for Continental. Interstate restrictions, the impact such a purchase would have on an acquirer's capital ratios, and Continental's peculiar strategy of focusing on the bottom half of the Fortune 500 as customers all serve as deterrents to a buyer, Mr. Theobald said. &quot;We're just not of interest to anybody else's strategy,&quot; he said.    The biggest obstacle to a management-led buy-out would be winning Federal Reserve Board approval for a more leveraged capital structure in a big bank, according to Mr. Theobald, as well as other bankers, banking lawyers and regulators. Balancing investors' desire for higher leverage and thus potentially bigger returns with the Fed's insistence on a sturdy capital base would be difficult, though not impossible, it appears.    One senior federal banking regulator said the Fed would likely allow a buy-out of the FDIC stake funded half with preferred stock and half with common.    First City Bancorp. of Texas was rescued earlier this year, for instance, in a $500 million recapitalization that was nearly half preferred stock.    Regulators aren't facing a First City-type emergency at Continental that would force them to bend the rules. But, should a public offering of the agency's stock fizzle, there are incentives for the FDIC and Fed to be flexible. For one thing, the FDIC could use the cash -- Texas bailouts are straining resources. And the Fed has an interest, too. Its Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago is owed about $2.58 billion by the FDIC on a loan made in 1984 to fund Continental's bailout.    &quot;Could you bend the Fed's capital guidelines?&quot; one banking lawyer asked. &quot;The answer is that the Fed would probably like to help the FDIC out. Also, the Fed has an economic interest in getting paid back.&quot;    In a management buy-out, investors would pay the FDIC cash for its shares and Continental would then issue to the investors new stock, giving them a controlling stake. A 40 million-share block of Continental common that the FDIC hasn't yet taken possession of, but is certain to, could be covered by an option.    Continental's profits appear more-than-adequate to handle its higher common stock dividend and a big preferred payout as well, so long as the bank's assets don't expand rapidly. Asset growth doesn't seem likely; Mr. Theobald's strategy calls for selling many loans rather than holding them.    For now, Mr. Theobald said, &quot;I continue to believe that the public sale (of FDIC-held shares) is more likely. In any event,&quot; he added, &quot;we always keep our pencils sharp&quot; for a management buy-out proposal. </TEXT></DOC>
