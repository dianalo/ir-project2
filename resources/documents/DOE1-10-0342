Calculation and analysisof plasma confinement were performed and a problem of stochastical diffusionlosses were experimentally studied. This has shown that Tandem MirrorTrap does not have a classical energy gain limitation of the usual magneticmirror and can eventually reach an ignition (Q = {infinity}). In theToroidally Linked Mirrors the radial losses can be substantially reducedby using ICRF power and by localizing of the curvature region in high-magneticfield sections. Concerning the heating, an experimental and theoreticalresearch was performed on negative hydrogen ion production mechanismfor charge exchange plasma fueling and heating. Mechanism of secondaryion emission from metal surfaces was explained and experiment on hydrogendynamics on the cathode surface have been carried out.</TEXT></DOC>
