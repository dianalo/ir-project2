Both foreignand domestic crude thereafter, ending the year somewhat higher than ayear ago. In contrast, product wholesale markets remained relativelystable throughout the year, while retail prices sustained a fairly steadyincrease. As has been the case for over a decade, major price movementsin international oil markets generally reflected responses to actualor perceived changes in the policies of the Organization of PetroleumExporting Countries (OPEC) and/or its members. The year began with priceson an upward trend, in reaction to the December 1986 OPEC meeting inwhich the members resolved to return to an official pricing structure(a departure from the market-based pricing of 1986), and to reduce outputquotas. Prices continued to rise until August, when evidence of continuedOPEC overproduction appeared to outweigh market optimism, triggeringa gradual slide that lasted the remainder of the year. Even with thedownturn in the fourth quarter, crude oil markets in 1987, as measuredby refiner acquisition costs, finished the year above year-end 1986 levels,and considerably above the lows reached in mid-1986. OPEC's struggleto maintain stable prices and production levels in 1987 reflected theorganization's difficulties in reaching and enforcing agreements amongits politically and economically diverse membership. 11 figs., 49 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
