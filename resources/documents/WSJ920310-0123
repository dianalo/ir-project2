This year, it may not work outthat way.   So far, &quot;it's been a mediocre market&quot; overseas,acknowledged Charles Hora, vice president and general managerof the Erie, Pa., manufacturer's chemical products division.&quot;Things are a little slow.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Indeed, just as the domestic economy struggles to gainmomentum, growth appears stalled in many other nations. Andone likely result is that the level of U.S. exports -- one ofthe few bright spots during the recent recession -- will slipthis year, hampering the turnaround at home.   &quot;It's certainly a serious concern,&quot; Michael Boskin,President Bush's chief economist, said in an interview. Henoted that exports now account for a greater share of grossdomestic product than at any time since World War II. Thus,&quot;if something were to impede our export growth, it would slowthe economy down all the more.&quot; GDP is a measure of the totaloutput of goods and services produced in the U.S.   Nariman Behravesh, president of Oxford Economics, aWynnewood, Pa., forecasting firm, figures that withoutshipments abroad last year, U.S. companies would have lost anadditional 300,000 jobs. The link between exports andemployment, he explained, is why the &quot;dicey&quot; global economicsituation poses such &quot;a risk to the U.S. recovery.&quot;   Last year, exports were the driving force behind the tinybit of growth the U.S. economy managed to eke out: Theysurged $39.7 billion during 1991 while GDP as a whole rose bya scant $17.1 billion.   Some analysts, including number crunchers at the NationalAssociation of Manufacturers, maintain that the U.S. can keeppace with the 7.6% gain in exports registered last year. Butothers anticipate growth of only 4% or 5% in 1992. Such aslowdown would add to the sense of lethargy that the economyis exhibiting, even as it climbs out of a recession.   Prompting particular worries are Japan, where the economyis losing steam and the mood of the business community hasturned dour, and Germany, whose economy seems to becontracting slightly. Together, these two nations account forabout 16% of the goods the U.S. ships abroad, according toCommerce Department statistics.   Elsewhere in Europe, the economies of Britain, Italy andFrance are sluggish, as unemployment continues to plague muchof the region. Excluding Germany, the European Communitysoaks up about 19% of U.S. exports.   Canada, which as the U.S.'s largest trading partnerabsorbs about 20% of U.S. exports, also is smarting. Canadianmanufacturers sounded alarms again last week after thecountry's central bank raised a key lending rate in a bid tosupport the Canadian dollar.   &quot;We're going to have to pull ourselves out of thisrecession,&quot; said David Wyss, research director forDRI/McGraw-Hill. &quot;The rest of the world won't exactly hurtus. But it won't help us a lot, either.&quot;   Exacerbating the fear of a drop-off in U.S. exports inrecent weeks has been the rising dollar, which makes U.S.products more expensive. In addition, political tensionsbetween Washington and some trading partners have heightenedlately, potentially complicating efforts to open foreignmarkets. &quot;We all extol competition, but nobody really seemsto want it,&quot; said Federal Reserve Gov. Wayne Angell.   Moreover, if Japan encounters serious economic trouble athome, it's likely to try to sell more products abroad, makingit even tougher for U.S. companies. &quot;The real battlegroundfor exports is for the so-called third-country trade,&quot; saidGreg Fager, director of the Institute of InternationalFinance, which conducts research for some of the world'smajor banks.   The tendency for companies to gravitate toward robustmarkets -- wherever they may be -- can, of course, benefitU.S. companies as well. For instance, Cleveland-basedReliance Electric Co. has sensed the economic slowdown inEurope, where it ships parts for electric motor drives. Butinstead of only selling locally, Reliance's customers arefinding they can hold their own by &quot;shipping outside thecontinent,&quot; where business has been steadier, according toJohn Morley, the president of Reliance.   For those most optimistic about exports, it's thedeveloping and newly industrialized countries that seem tohold the most promise. Latin America, for example, has&quot;become increasingly important to the U.S. over the lastcouple of years,&quot; said Michael Mussa, economic counselor atthe International Monetary Fund.   At a recent hearing of Congress's Joint EconomicCommittee, Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan pointed to thestrength of the Mexican economy when he predicted that totalU.S. exports will &quot;creep up somewhat further&quot; this year.   Timing may be everything. If the U.S. can emerge from itseconomic malaise quickly and forcefully enough, it may beable to help the rest of the world reverse its decline. Ifnot, the rest of the world may help keep the U.S. mired down.   Lord Corp.'s Mr. Hora said the company, which makesadhesives for the auto industry, is banking on the firstscenario. &quot;We think the U.S. will lead the way out,&quot; he said,&quot;and Europe will follow.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
