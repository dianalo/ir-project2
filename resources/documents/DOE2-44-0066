Particular attention is paid to changes occurringin the use of energy since 1973 and to the policies that were actuallyenacted. It is shown that energy consumption has risen by an averageof 4.8%/y since 1950, with the relative share of petroleum in energysupply decreasing significantly since 1973, due in part to substitutionby gas and electricity. In the transport sector, gas is being promotedas a fuel substitute; the Marsden Point oil refinery expansion was sufficientto negate the need to import refined oil products; and the Motonui syntheticfuel plant is producing synthetic petroleum from natural gas. However,those two plants are not economically successful, raising questions aboutthe benefits of self-sufficiency based on nonrenewable indigenous energyforms. Data on energy conservation and efficiency indicate little evidenceof conservation, and conservation considerations have not been a partof the search for alternative energy supplies. Renewable energy forms,except hydroelectric and geothermal power, make little contribution tototal consumption. In 1987, energy policy changed direction with thegovernment's adoption of a more market oriented approach. Integratedenergy planning no longer exists, with a further decline in relevanceof conservation and renewables as part of a national strategy. 10 refs.,7 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
