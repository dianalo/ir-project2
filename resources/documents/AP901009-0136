About 20 young blacks stole knives from a store and beganstabbing people along a street near the beach, police said.   ``They were in a berserk state and were lashing out with knivesat anyone who was near them,'' witness Robert Trulock told theindependent South African Press Association.   Two suspects were shot and wounded by police, and seven werearrested, police said.   The attack may have been racially motivated, said police Lt.Nina Barkhuizen. Police were investigating the possibility thatsome participants wore badges of the Pan Africanist Congress, amilitant black opposition group, she said.   Despite deep racial divisions and widespread violence in SouthAfrica, there have been few cases of blacks randomly attackingwhites.   Law and Order Minister Adriaan Vlok condemned the violence andcalled for private citizens to refrain from seeking revenge.   ``It might be somebody trying to provoke a reaction from thewhite population,'' said Thabo Mbeki, a spokesman for the AfricanNational Congress.   The black youths took the knives from a store specializing inweapons from the Far East, Barkhuizen said.   They then ran down a street next to the beachfront and stabbedwhites, witnesses said.   Bleeding victims staggered into the lobby of the Lonsdale Hoteland collapsed in front of horrified guests.   Eight people, ranging in age from 15 to 85, were hospitalizedwith stab wounds, Barkhuizen said. A hospital official said threeof the white victims were in serious condition.   Patrick Lekota, an ANC official in Durban, called the attack ``adesperate attempt to discredit the liberation movement as awhole.''   About 5,000 blacks have been killed in factional fighting since1986 in Natal Province, which includes Durban. But the violence hasbeen almost exclusively in black areas, pitting Zulu supporters ofthe conservative Inkatha movement against Xhosas and other blackslinked to the ANC.   The warfare spread to black townships around Johannesburg inAugust, and about 800 people were killed in the ensuing weeks.   Fighting in the townships has eased recently, but strainedrelations remain between the white-led government and ANC.   ANC leader Nelson Mandela has accused security forces of fanningthe violence, possibly at the behest of right-wing elements whooppose government-ANC peace talks on ending the apartheid system ofracial segregation.   The government has denied the charges and challenged accusers toprovide proof. Vlok said Tuesday that affidavits supplied to thegovernment purportedly backing the accusations had proved to befabrications.   Both the ANC and Inkatha oppose apartheid but differ on theshape of a future South Africa. Inkatha supports a free marketeconomy and promotes tribalism, while the ANC promotes more leftistand pan-tribal positions.</TEXT></DOC>
