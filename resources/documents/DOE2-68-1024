The energy situation in developing countriesis characterized by a large rural sector consuming a relatively smallamount of commercial, largely oil-based, energy; critical shortages oftraditional energy, notably wood; low levels of conversion efficiency;and low levels of energy consumption. Small scale, decentralized energysystems involving renewable sources offer opportunities to solve suchbasic energy needs as cooking, water pumping, agricultural processing,refrigeration, and telecommunications. Appropriate technologies undergoingresearch and development in Canada were screened to select the most promisingCanadian capabilities. Options involving hardware were identified aslow-head hydro equipment, and photovoltaics for communications and waterpumping. Options involving expertise were identified in cooking stoveand anaerobic digester design, forest resource management, and energyresource inventory and demand assessment. These capabilities were chosento meet the requirements of Canadian aid programs, and successful implementationof such programs will involve such elements as support of local technicaland manufacturing capabilities, consistent long-term support, and integrationof renewable energy with national development objectives. 21 refs., 7figs., 13 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
