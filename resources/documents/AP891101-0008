The researchers studied 33 men who had worked in 1953 at a paperfactory that made cigarette filters containing crocidolite fibers,a form of asbestos. Twenty-eight had died, triple the expecteddeath rate.   The increased mortality was almost entirely attributable to 18deaths from three asbestos-associated diseases _ lung cancer,malignant mesothelioma and asbestosis. The men had worked in thefactory a median of under two years.   Work exposure to other forms of asbestos also has been linkedwith lung diseases, but crocidolite is thought to be especiallyhazardous.   The researchers said doctors should be alert to the appearanceof asbestos-related diseases from unusual sources of industrialexposure.   ``These results emphasize that intense, localized occupatonalexposures to asbestos may have effects decades after the exposurescease and that such effects may remain unrecognized andunreported,'' they wrote in the New England Journal of Medicine.   They said it is unclear whether smoking cigarettes with theasbestos-laden filters increased the risk of disease.   The study was conducted by James A. Talcott of Dana-FarberCancer Institute in Boston.</TEXT></DOC>
