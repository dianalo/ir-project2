With a lot of luck, some might even stick with the show when thenew programs start on the other networks in September.;    Fox isn't being coyabout the scheduling strategy. Network officials even have declared theirintention to shake up the normal fall-season routine by starting other showsearly.;    Such a move makes sense for Fox, a network still in its infancy. Ithas about 100 fewer stations than the other networks, broadcasts only fivenights a week (Thursday through Monday) and programs an hour less than theothers on all nights but Sunday. It has to find the other networks' soft spotsand attack there.;    Obviously, they all have the same Achilles' heel: thererun-clogged summer months. Fox isn't the only competitor to nip at thoseheels in summer. The cable networks have been doing it for a decade.;   Though some Fox officials, in talks to TV-industry groups, have called for anend to the traditional 30-week September-to-April TV season, I'm certainthat's the last thing they really want to see happen. If the TV season were anall-year affair and the Big Three packed the summer with first-run episodes oftheir big hits, Fox would be flattened like a jack rabbit under asteamroller.;    Still, there are many top officials at the Big Three who alsohave declared the 30-week season an anachronism and have urged the industry todo away with the &quot;season&quot; concept entirely.;    One of them is BrandonTartikoff, the programming genius who led NBC from the ratings boonies into aposition of absolute dominance over the competition during the 1980s.Tartikoff left NBC earlier this year to run Paramount studios, but he neverrecanted his call for a 52-week TV &quot;season.&quot;;    So why hasn't it happened?Most advocates blame the advertising community and its hidebound attitudesabout the best ways to sell spot advertising on television.;    As near as Ican tell, the operating theory is that television viewing drops sharply inJune all across America, and doesn't pick up again until after Labor Day. Thereason: Warm weather lures people outdoors for vacations and other forms ofrecreation.;    So, naturally, advertisers don't want to spend as much on TVin the summer nor be charged the same rates they pay in the fall. Theconventional wisdom says a first-run attraction, even one as big as theoriginal &quot;Roots,&quot; wouldn't have drawn anywhere near the viewership it did inJanuary.;    Though I'm not sure that's entirely true -- ABC's 1984 summerOlympic Games didn't exactly rack up shabby numbers in prime time -- I'mwilling to concede the average first-run series episode probably would performrather poorly in July.;    I also suspect that the networks deserve more ofthe blame for the &quot;rerun season&quot; of summer than they're willing to accept.It's a mostly low-cost time of year for them. They can make money off episodesthey've already amortized and burn off pilots they financed but rejected forthe fall lineup.;    If the networks had to order another dozen or so episodesof their hit shows for the three months of summer, the lower ratings they'dget probably would make them very uneconomical. That's because the ad rateswould have to be lower but the fees paid to the shows' producers would remainthe same.;    Right now, the Big Three can coast through the summer, spendingmuch less for what's on the air and using their profits to pay for the fallshows already being produced.;    That's just one of many reasons I don'tthink we're going to see a 52-week &quot;season&quot; soon. Maybe we'll see an end tothe crazy ratings &quot;sweeps&quot; periods, in which big network special attractionscompete head to head, and maybe even an extension of the TV season throughMay, which already is a &quot;sweeps&quot; month. Maybe, but not likely.;    Though Ihate summer reruns as much as anybody else, I'm personally not eager for achange in the system. It does give the little guys like Fox a chance toprosper, which is good, and also gives everybody a darn good reason to keepthe TV set turned off for a couple of months, which is even better.  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Ron Miller column  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  San Jose Mercury News  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910701  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  July  </MONTH><PG.COL>  9B  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  893  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday July 1, 199100183010,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
