Theregulations became effective on October 14, 1988. See Notice of EffectiveDate published elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. The borrower rights include, among others, certaindisclosure requirements on borrowers' loans specified in the Farm CreditAct of 1971, as amended by the Agricultural Credit Act of 1987 (the Act).After publication of the final regulations, the Farm Credit Administration(FCA) received comments from the Farm Credit Corporation of America (FCCA)and individual Farm Credit System institutions that the institutions couldnot presently comply with two portions of the disclosure regulations concerningthe effective interest rate. Furthermore, the comments expressed the viewthat even if compliance were possible at some time in the future, suchcompliance would create unnecessary costs for the institutions and resultin disclosures that would not be meaningful to borrowers. Therefore, inlight of these concerns, pending further action on the regulations, theFarm Credit Administration Board (Board) deferred the following portionsof the regulations: (1) The language in 12 CFR 614.4367(c)(1) which states``* * *, including the effective interest rate;'' and (2) 12 CFR 614.4367(d)(1).See Notice of Effective Date published elsewhere in this issue of the <T4>Federal Register</T4>.

However, the deferral does not exempt lenders fromcompliance with the remainder of the borrower rights regulations whichwere effective as of October 14, 1988. Lenders are presently required todisclose to prospective borrowers, among other things, the current interestrate, the amount and frequency by which an adjustable interest rate maychange, and the current effective interest rate which is the interest rateadjusted to take into consideration any stock or participation certificatepurchase requirement and loan origination charges (12 CFR 614.4367(a)).When an interest rate is adjusted on an outstanding loan, a lender mustdisclose the new interest rate, the date on which the rate is effective,and a statement of any factors other than standard adjustment factors whichwere taken into account in establishing the new rate (12 CFR 614.4367(c)).In addition, whenever the stock or participation certificate requirementis changed, thus modifying the effective interest rate, the lender mustnotify the borrower of the date that the new rate is effective and a statementof the actions that resulted in the new effective interest rate (12 CFR614.4367(d) (2) and (3)).Throughout the development of the borrower rights regulations, FCA hasbalanced the rights to which borrowers are entitled against unnecessarycosts to the Farm Credit institutions. The deferral will enable FCA tofurther evaluate the compliance and cost problems identified by lenderswhile still ensuring that borrowers receive the other required disclosures.The compliance problems apparently stem primarily from a change in thedefinition of ``effective interest rate''. Prior to the 1987 amendmentsto the Act, the regulations defined ``effective interest rate'' to takeinto consideration stock or participation certificates as a percentageof the initial net proceeds of the loan, but did not require the inclusionof loan origination charges. The 1987 amendments to the Act altered thedefinition of ``effective interest rate'' by requiring disclosure, notlater than the time of loan closing, of ``the effect, as shown by a representativeexample or examples, of <T3>any loan origination charges</T3> or purchases of stock or participationcertificates on the effective rate of interest.'' 12 U.S.C. 2199(a)(3)(emphasis added). Thus, the new definition of ``effective interest rate''now includes the impact of any loan origination charges. Pursuant to the1987 amendments and the subsequent changes in the regulations, institutionsmust now include loan origination charges when calculating and dealingwith the effective interest rate. Comments have asserted that to do somay result in great cost to the institutions, especially concerning subsequentdisclosures on loans which existed prior to the regulations becoming effective.<ITAG tagnum="85">Disclosure of New Effective Interest Rate Based on Change in StatedContract Rate_Deferred Portion of 12 CFR 614.4367(c)(1)</ITAG>FCCA commented on the deferred portion of 12 CFR 614.4367(c) by statingthat there is a need to receive comments on the issue of requiring disclosureof a change in the effective interest rate because of a change in the statedcontract rate. FCCA expressed concern that many Farm Credit Banks do notpresently have loan origination charges in their data bases. Thus, theywill not be able to comply with the deferred portion of 12 CFR 614.4367(c)(1).One lender supported the FCCA's comments by stating that loan originationcharges had not yet been included in the data base. It appears that, ifthe lenders are not able to comply with the deferred portion of 12 CFR614.4367(c)(1) because they do not have loan origination charges in theirdata bases as the lenders and FCCA claim, then they may also be unableto comply with 12 CFR 614.4367(d)(1), which is discussed below.One Farm Credit Bank (FCB) expressed the concern that the requirement ofthe deferred portion of 12 CFR 614.4367(c) would cause a tremendous burdenfrom both an accounting and data processing standpoint. The FCB claimsthat this subsequent disclosure would be an unnecessary one as long asthe requirement of, among other things, the disclosures at the time ofloan closing as prescribed by 12 CFR 614.4367(a) are in place.Another lender stated that even <T3>partial </T3>compliance with the deferred portion of the regulations(i.e. manually inputting the loan origination charges) would cost approximately$750,000. In addition to the costs involved, this lender questioned themeaningfulness of this disclosure by referring to the Federal Reserve Board'simplementing regulations for the Truth in Lending Act (12 CFR Part 226)which do not require similar subsequent disclosures of changes in the annualpercentage rate in variable rate transactions. FCA is now reconsidering whether the deferred portion of 12 CFR 614.4367(c)(1)is necessary to provide meaningful and timely disclosures to borrowersif they receive all other disclosures required by the regulations. Onefactor to be addressed is whether compliance with the deferred portionof the regulation would result in significant extra costs to the institutions.Therefore, by proposing to delete the deferred portion of 12 CFR 614.4367(c)(1),FAC solicits additional comments on these issues. <ITAG tagnum="85">Disclosure of New Effective Interest Rate Based on Change in Stockor Participation Certificate Requirement_12 CFR 614.4367(d)(1) </ITAG>Although only two comments specifically addressed compliance with the requirementsof 12 CFR 614.4367(d)(1), FCA believes that it is appropriate to addressthis issue also. One FCB said that for the same reasons articulated concerningthe compliance and costs problems of the deferred portion of 12 CFR 614.4367(d)(1),FCA should also consider amending 12 CFR 614.4367(d)(1). The other commenter stated that in addition to the deferred portion of12 CFR 614.4367(c)(1), the requirement found in 12 CFR 614.4367(d)(1) shouldbe reexamined, particularly in light of the fact that Farm Credit Systemlenders are presently examining and redesigning their capitalization bylawsto conform with the capital adequacy regulations. The commenter suggestedthat instead of informing borrowers of the new rate, subsequent disclosuresshould include either a standardized example or a copy of the formula thatthe borrower could use to compute his own rate. FCA invites comment on whether informing borrowers of a change in stockor participation certificate purchase requirements is a meaningful disclosurewithout a calculation of the new effective interest rate. FCA proposesthat 12 CFR 614.4367(d)(1) be amended accordingly. Where the lender isable to provide the new effective interest rate (<T3>e.g., </T3>on loans, closed after the effective date of the regulations,which must include information on the loan origination charges pursuantto 12 CFR 614.4367(a)(3)), it may be easier for the lender to provide theactual new rate. Where such loan origination charges are not availableor easily included in a lender's data base, the lender may satisfy therequirements of this regulation by notifying the borrower of the impactof the change on the effective interest rate. Thus, a representative examplemay be used to inform the borrower how his effective interest rate hasbeen changed by the change in the stock or participation certificate requirement.FCA solicits comments on this issue. In addition, FCA solicits comments in general on the requirements of 12CFR 614.4367(d). Specifically, FCA solicits comments on the impact of,meaningfulness of, and circumstances under which such disclosures wouldbe made.<ITAG tagnum="84">List of Subjects in 12 CFR Part 614 </ITAG>Agriculture, Banks, Banking, Credit, Foreign trade, Reporting and recordkeepingrequirements, Rural areas.
