Southland extended the offer to Sept. 12, three daysbefore the scheduled expiration of its proposed deal withIto-Yokado Co., the Japanese operator of Southland's 7-Elevenconvenience stores.</LP><TEXT>   To complete the transaction, which would give Ito-Yokado a70% stake in Southland, the convenience-store chain needsapproval from bondholders representing 95% of the bondsoutstanding in each of five debt issues. When the firstextension of the offer expired last Thursday, Southland hadreceived tenders from holders of 46% of its 18% notes, 46.3%of its 16.75% notes, 64% of its 16.5% notes, 65.9% of its15.75% notes, and 89.9% of its 13.5% senior notes. Onlyholders of the company's preferred stock exceeded theminimums required in the complex deal, tendering 90.9% of theshares outstanding. Only two-thirds approval of preferredshareholders was required.   &quot;We plan to intensify our efforts to communicate withthose bondholders who have not yet tendered and expectcontinued progress during the extension,&quot; said ClarkMatthews, Southland's chief financial officer. According toJohn Gordon, president of Deltec Securities Corp. andchairman of the Southland bondholder committee, at least onebig holder, with 12% of each of two issues, has been onvacation and couldn't be contacted.   Yet merely extending the offer may not be enough. WilliamEddleman Jr. of Dallas-based Barre andamp; Co., a holder along withits clients of about $30 million in Southland bonds, said,&quot;Officially, we're telling our clients we'd like to see ifthere's going to be a better deal.&quot;   &quot;Anybody holding out for a better deal is totallyunreasonable, considering the economic environment we're innow,&quot; countered Mr. Gordon, whose committee rejected threeearlier Southland offers before approving the fourth andlatest one. Calling it &quot;the best deal that can be gotten,&quot;Mr. Gordon predicted that it would receive bondholderapproval by Sept. 12.   Southland's current offer would give bondholders about 25%of the company's common stock. The founding Thompson familyof Dallas would get about 5% of the stock.   Southland went into default on its $1.8 billion ofpublicly traded debt in mid-July, but avoided being forcedinto filing for bankruptcy-law protection when the bondholdercommittee endorsed the terms of its most recent exchangeoffer.   The company, which owns about 6,700 7-Eleven and otherconvenience stores in the U.S. and Canada, went private in a$4.9 billion leveraged buy-out in late 1987 to avoid athreatened hostile takeover. But increased competition erodedsales and profit margins and made it difficult for thecompany to service the huge debt from the buy-out.</TEXT></DOC>
