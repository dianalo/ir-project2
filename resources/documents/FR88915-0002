This rule amends a number of Export ControlCommodity Numbers on the CCL in the categories of metal-working machinery,chemical and petroleum equipment, general industrial equipment, and transportationequipment. These revisions have resulted from a review of strategic controlsmaintained by the U.S. and certain allied countries through the CoordinatingCommittee (COCOM). Such multilateral controls restrict the availabilityof strategic items to controlled countries. With the concurrence of theDepartment of Defense, the Department of Commerce has determined pursuantto the provisions of the Export Administration Act of 1979, as amended,that this rule is necessary to protect U.S. national security interests.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>EFFECTIVE DATE:</T2> This rule is effective September 15, 1988. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2> For questions of a technicalnature on chemical and petroleum equipment, call George Kuzmycz, Officeof Technology and Policy Analysis, Telephone: (202) 377-5696.

Because this rule concerns a foreign and military affairs function ofthe United States, it is not a rule or regulation within the meaning ofsection 1(a) of Executive Order 12291, and it is not subject to the requirementsof that Order. Accordingly, no preliminary or final Regulatory Impact Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 2. This rule contains a collection of information subject to the requirementsof the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (44 U.S.C. 3501 <T3>et seq.</T3>). This collection has been approved by the Office of Managementand Budget under control number 0694-0005. 3. This rule does not contain policies with Federalism implications sufficientto warrant preparation of a Federalism assessment under Executive Order12612. 4. Because a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity for publiccomment are not required to be given for this rule by section 553 of theAdministrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553), or by any other law, undersections 603(a) and 604(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C.603(a) and 604(a)) no intitial or final Regulatory Flexibility Analysishas to be or will be prepared. 5. Section 13(a) of the Export Administration Act of 1979 (EAA), as amended(50 U.S.C. app. 2412(a)), exempts this rule from all requirements of section553 of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. 553), includingthose requiring publication of a notice of proposed rulemaking an opportunityfor public comment, and a delay in effective date. This rule is also exemptfrom these APA requirements because it involves a foreign and militaryaffairs function of the United States. Section 13(b) of the EAA does notrequire that this rule be published in proposed form because this ruleimplements regulatory changes based on COCOM review. Further, no otherlaw requires that a notice of proposed rulemaking and an opportunity forpublic comment be given for this rule. Accordingly, it is being issued in final form. However, as with other Departmentof Commerce rules, comments from the public are always welcome.
