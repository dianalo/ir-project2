Complaints about service are at an all-time high, with flight delays and cancellations provoking protest chants and even violence among angry passengers. The alarming rise in reported midair near-collisions has sharpened demands for improved safety. Meanwhile, mergers have given some carriers so much market clout that fliers are seeing the consumer benefits of deregulation eroded.    Indeed, negative feelings about the industry have become almost a matter of reflex. Rep. Bud Shuster recalls watching a football game on television with his friends recently, during which a Delta Air Lines Inc. commercial came on. &quot;Suddenly, everybody started hissing,&quot; the Pennsylvania Republican says, adding that the anger appeared to be &quot;directed at all airlines.&quot;    The jet roar of public fury has prompted much debate about how to make the nation's air-travel system work better. The airlines are offering their own proposals, and have launched publicity and lobbying efforts to guard their interests. Unions and consumer groups are also getting involved.    And so, perhaps most significantly, is Congress. Foreshadowing a likely shift back toward government regulation of the industry, lawmakers have made impassioned calls for everything from stiff fines against carriers that lose bags to reestablishment of the Civil Aeronautics Board, the federal oversight agency whose dissolution in 1984 culminated the deregulatory moves begun in the late 1970s.    &quot;There lurks behind the bushes . . . the return of the regulatory Jedi,&quot; says John E. Robson, a former CAB chairman who is now dean of the business school at Emory University.    A recent Roper Organization poll indicates popular support for at least some added intervention. It found that 35% of Americans believe there isn't enough government regulation of the airlines, more than double the 16% who thought that in 1984. Almost half now believe airlines should have to get government permission to raise fares, up from 35% three years ago.    &quot;Consumer disenchantment could be a very serious problem for this industry,&quot; says Edward Beauvais, chairman of America West Airlines Inc., one of the few survivors among the carriers started after deregulation. &quot;If you ignore these issues, then you invite re-regulation.&quot;    Already, the House has passed tough legislation that would force airlines to give passengers free tickets when their bags are at least two hours late, and compel the airlines and the U.S. Department of Transportation to set up toll-free consumer hot lines. Airlines canceling flights for reasons other than safety would be slapped with fines of $10,000.    The Senate passed a companion bill two weeks ago. Both it and the House bill -- which are scheduled to go to conference later this month-would also require airlines to disclose on-time performance, how many passengers are &quot;bumped&quot; from overbooked flights and how often bags are lost. Even the DOT, which has been excoriated by lawmakers who contend it responded too slowly to air-travel problems, recently directed the airlines to provide it with some of this information. The agency plans to release the first data early this week.    Further proposals -- some highly controversial -- include discouraging private planes from using busy airports, and the imposition of surcharges on passengers or planes traveling during rush hours. Sen. Larry Pressler, a South Dakota Republican, says he plans to push legislation that would require the airlines to follow pricing policies that have &quot;some relationship between the number of miles traveled and the price of a ticket.&quot; Sen. Glenn English, an Oklahoma Democrat, has 10 co-sponsors on his bill to recreate the CAB.    There isn't any assurance, of course, that the air-travel system would benefit from any of this, or that well-meaning legislative remedies couldn't backfire.    Opponents of re-regulation -- including the Reagan administration and many economists, both liberal and conservative -- warn that some of deregulation's indisputable advantages, such as billions of dollars in passenger savings and more frequent service on popular routes, could be threatened under current proposals. They argue, for instance, that while some in Congress want to restrict flights at busy airports to reduce delays, such a measure might easily lead to higher fares.    &quot;I'm worried that, under the cover of dealing with the other problems that are clearly ones of high irritation, they (lawmakers) will slip a mickey to airline deregulation,&quot; says Emory's Mr. Robson. Many critics of re-regulation go so far as to argue that the best solution would be to deregulate the industry even more -- say, by turning air-traffic control over to private companies.    There is little enthusiasm even in Congress for a return to full-fledged economic regulation of the airlines. But concern is mounting in some quarters that the move toward some re-regulation could set a precedent for other industries, just as airline decontrol set a pattern before. &quot;If it rains long enough and hard enough, everybody gets wet,&quot; says Wayne Valis, organizer of the Transportation Reform Alliance, a group of airline, railroad and trucking officials seeking to promote deregulation.    Despite the wide disagreement on solutions, almost everyone concurs that something has to be done. Developments over the past year or so have made it increasingly apparent that while deregulation may have been a start in the right direction, it isn't the cure-all many of its proponents made it out to be.    Last year, record delays -- 417,644 flights departed at least 15 minutes late, according to the Federal Aviation Administration -- cost airlines and passengers an estimated $3 billion, analysts say. This year, delays have eased considerably, but safety fears have intensified. Midair near-collisions involving at least one jetliner or commuter plane totaled 383 through the first nine months of this year, up 48% from the same period last year, according to the FAA. Errors by air-traffic controllers and pilots are also above last year's totals.    &quot;We're still running up at that red line,&quot; says Sen. Ernest Hollings. The South Carolina Democrat is chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, which is studying whether the government should sharply increase its rules on airlines.    Moreover, some pilots charge that, because of the fierce competition among airlines to cut costs and meet schedules, some important equipment repairs aren't being done promptly. A 1986 survey by the Air Line Pilots Association, the union that represents 40,000 commercial-airline pilots, found that half of a scientific sampling of 1,000 pilots believed that maintenance of their planes had declined and that captains were sometimes pressured into accepting planes with an excessive number of faulty items. The airlines staunchly deny taking any safety shortcuts.    A two-year wave of mergers has left the industry more concentrated than it was before deregulation, many analysts say. The Aviation Consumer Action Project, an advocacy group, estimates that the nation's 10 largest airlines now control 95% of the market, compared with 87% in 1978 and 75% in 1984. And while the number of airlines grew to 234 from 36 in the wake of deregulation, bankruptcies and acquisitions have since pared the ranks to 74, says Julius Maldutis, a vice president of Salomon Brothers Inc. Many analysts predict the emerging oligopoly will result in hefty fare increases in coming years; few say they believe a discount carrier like the defunct People Express could be created now.    In addition, politicians representing rural areas complain that higher fares and reduced service have become the norm in some communities after airlines were no longer required to serve them. South Dakota's Sen. Pressler notes that it costs him about $600 to fly round-trip between Washington and Sioux Falls. &quot;I could go to Rome and back on that,&quot; he says.    And there are signs that deregulation hasn't made air travel as accessible to lower-income Americans as previously thought. In a study commissioned by Congressional Quarterly magazine, the Consumer Federation of America found that after deregulation the percentage of individuals who took at least one flight increased most sharply among the wealthiest 40% of the nation's households; those in the other income groups showed little or no change.    The controversy over such issues may grow even more heated as the air-travel system comes under increasing strain. The number of air passengers -- currently about 450 million annually -- is expected to double by the year 2000.    Finding the best solutions, says John Corbett, a Washington lawyer and a founding member of the new consumer group Airline Passengers of America, will be &quot;the big issue of the next decade.&quot;    ---   &quot;Is there too much government regulation of airlines, not enough or about the right amount now?&quot;                                   1987          1984    Not enough                     35%           16%    About right                    35%           52%    Too much                       17%           15%    Don't know                     13%           17%   &quot;Should airlines be allowed to raise or lower their fareson their own, or should they be required to get governmentpermission?&quot;    Free to raise fares            43%           53%    Get government permission      49%           35%    Don't know                      8%           12%   Source: Roper Organization poll of 1,997 adultsnationwide, conducted in July 1987</TEXT></DOC>
