As a result, two types of effects of the TibetanPlateau are found. One is the effects on the synoptic disturbances whichmove southward along the mountains. In this case, cold surges generatealong the coasial line of China Continent. The other is the excitationof the edge disturbances whose the horizontal scale is about 200 km.The edge disturbance is not always excited. It is excited when a largetrough collides against the mountains. In this case, cold surges generatealong the mountains. (13 figs, 1 tab, 13 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
