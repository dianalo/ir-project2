This article is an adaptationof the report with the same title, published by the working group 'Preconditions'in October 1988. It is investigated which conditions are necessary toget cogeneration applications off the ground. One of the conditions isto realize a stable and general gas price policy for the electric powerindustry. It is indicated that the present fuel price system makes anumber of cogeneration projects impossible or results in a semi-optimalapplication of cogeneration. For six cogeneration projects the financialresults are given and presented in graphics. Cogeneration project calculationshave been carried out for present prices, scenario prices and competitiveprices. 5 figs., 5 tabs.</TEXT></DOC>
