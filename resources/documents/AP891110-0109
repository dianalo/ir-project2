The militants, armed with Chinese-made AK-47 rifles, enteredThapar Engineering College and knocked on the door of thedormitory, said a police spokesman. When one of the students openedthe door, the gunmen opened fire, he said.   Police said the gunmen were believed to be Sikh extremistsfighting for an independent homeland in Punjab, a rich farmingstate on the northern border with Pakistan.   ``When I awoke, I saw a man with a gun firingindiscriminately,'' student Umesh Benjamin said from his bed inPatiala's Rajendra Hospital. ``Before I could get up, I was hit bya bullet and then I don't know what happened.''   At least 16 people died instantly and three died later of theirinjuries. Five other students remained hospitalized, doctors said.   The victims were from colleges in neighboring states who hadcome to attend the school's annual youth festival, said the policespokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules.   The attack occurred at 2:30 a.m., hours before Prime MinisterRajiv Gandhi arrived in Chandigarh, the capital of Punjab, for abrief visit. Gandhi made no public statement on attack.   Patiala, in southern Punjab, is about 45 miles southwest ofChandigarh.   The Thapar College, one of the best known institutions innorthern India, has about 1,500 students. About 200 others had comefor the youth festival.   Sikh extremists have killed at least 1,544 people this year intheir bid to carve out a separate homeland they want to callKhalistan, or ``Land of the Pure.''   The radicals allege Sikhs are socially and culturallydiscriminated against by the Hindu majority and the Hindu-dominatedgovernment.   Sikhs make up 2 percent of India's 880 million people but are aslight majority in Punjab. Hindus comprise 82 percent of thepopulation.</TEXT></DOC>
