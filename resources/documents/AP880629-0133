(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The FBI is investigating the abduction of anovice nun wearing traditional habit who was forcibly put into acar by members of her family opposed to her remaining in theconvent, authorities said.   The nun's brother, who participated in the abduction, said hissister is free to return to the convent after she listens to herfamily's arguments against it.   It was the second time in four months in which a family memberof Mary Sue Greve, known as Sister Mary Cecilia, 22, attempted tokeep her from returning to the convent, state police said.   Police said Ms. Greve was walking with two other nuns on astreet near St. Joseph Novitiate Convent in Roundtop, N.Y., whereshe has lived for the past two years, when she was pushed into awaiting car Sunday.   John Greve of Cincinnati said he and two brothers and theirfather took his sister.   ``The reason we did this was to give her the facts,'' he said.If she wants to return to the convent after she hears her familyout, she is free to do so. But we know that will be the last timewe will probably ever see her again.''   Greve said the family opposed his sister's joining St. Josephafter the family broke with a traditionalist Catholic church in aCincinnati suburb.   St. Joseph's, with about 40 nuns and novices, is not recognizedby the Roman Catholic Church.   Special Agent Michael O'Brien said Tuesday the FBI wasinvestigating her disappearance, but declined to elaborate.   ``We are all in a state of shock,'' said the Rev. ClarenceKelly, a spiritual adviser at the convent. ``The last I ever heardof something like this was the case of St. Thomas Aquinas in the13th century. His family kidnapped him because they did not wanthim to become a Dominican priest.''   New York State Police said Ms. Greve went to Cincinnati, whereher parents live, following Sunday's incident. Her brother refusedto say where Ms. Greve and the rest of the family were.   State police said they would not press charges unless the womanwants to file them.   ``It's a family-type matter,'' Trooper Ron Rieseberg saidMonday. ``I think they're (authorities) mostly interested in thewell-being of the girl.''   About four months ago, Ms. Greve's mother abducted her afterpersuading her to get into a car to listen to a tape of hernephews, police said. Once inside the car, the mother drove off,refusing to return her daughter to the convent.</TEXT></DOC>
