Clark appeared to choke back tears during his testimony, tellingthe jury: ``I never in my entire life meant to mislead or deceiveor misrepresent.''   Clark faces one charge of felony theft by deception. He isaccused of entertaining friends, girlfriends, relatives andpolitical supporters on his state Visa card.   He testified that he accidentally recorded as guests people whodidn't eat meals with him when he itemized bills months later, buthe said repeatedly he was given no restrictions on how to spend his$5 million budget.   ``I have tried to pay all personal entertainment that is on thecard,'' Clark said during 2{ hours of testimony.   Clark, whose annual salary is $26,500, took the stand after ajudge denied a defense motion to dismiss the charge. Circuit JudgePerry Whitmore said Clark didn't have authority to use the creditcard how he wished.   ``Any use of these funds, whether in Little Rock or in Memphis,was inappropriate for there were no appropriations by theLegislature for that purpose,'' Whitmore said.   Prosecutor Chris Piazza accused Clark earlier in the trial ofimproperly billing taxpayers at least $8,448.27 on his credit cardfor the meals of personal guests on 56 occasions from 1986 to 1989.Clark could get up to 20 years in prison and a $15,000 fine ifconvicted.   More than 100 of 141 witnesses who testified against Clark inthe last week said they either didn't dine with Clark or didn'tdiscuss state business, despite claims to the contrary that Clarkmade on his expense forms.   The state rested its case Monday with the testimony of threewomen. The women said they didn't know the state paid for theirdinners, which sometimes topped $300 a meal.   Clark's former fiancee, Carrie Christie of Atlanta, testifiedthat Clark dated her, popped the question and later got hisengagement ring back during more than a dozen meals and trips paidfor by the state in 1986 and 1987.   She said they broke off their engagement during an Atlanta mealClark's expense forms show was held to discuss ``low-level waste.''She said the topic never came up.   In some of her most damaging testimony, she said Clark oftenjotted down notes on the back of his Visa receipts. Clark has saidhis record-keeping was sloppy and that he reconstructed his expenseforms up to three months after the fact.   ``I could have spent more time. I could have done a better job''with expense records, Clarks said. ``But if I had to do it again, Iwould do it much different and I would do it much better.''   Cheryl Pruett of Germantown, Tenn., testified she spent thenight at a Memphis, Tenn., hotel with Clark that records show thestate paid for. In honor of her birthday, Clark paid $245 with theVisa card at a Germantown restaurant, she said.   Karen Aufdenberg of Little Rock testified she attended at leasteight meals for which the state was billed, including four in NewOrleans.   ``There are times in my job, because I am divorced, I wouldthink an escort was appropriate because the functions were forcouples,'' Clark said.   Clark, a Democrat, has been the Arkansas attorney general since1979.   He said he always paid for the women's airfare and routinelyreimbursed the state for dozens of social meals that wereoriginally charged to the credit card.   Clark said it was difficult for him to determine when the stateshould pay for meals for others because he often mixed businesswith pleasure.   ``I live, eat sleep and breath politics,'' he said. ``That isthe truth. It's not necessarily good, but it's the truth.''   Clark said publicity surrounding his state expensereimbursements derailed his plans to run for governor.   Piazza was to cross-examine Clark on Wednesday.</TEXT></DOC>
