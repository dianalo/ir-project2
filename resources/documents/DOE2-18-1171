Additional studies were conductedto determine the economic threshold, to derive energy budgets for variouscrop production regions and to insure that expeller extracted meals wouldmake acceptable animal feeds. This research was conducted by an integratedteam of scientists from the University of Idaho which initiated effortsin this field in December of 1979. Experiments were conducted by agronomists,agricultural engineers, animal nutritionists, chemical engineers, andagricultural economists. This report summarizes data accumulated fromApril 1986 to May 1987 as part of USDA/ARS Research Agreement No. 58-7B30-2-402.Copies for this report can be obtained from the Director of the IdahoAgricultural Experiment Station, College of Agriculture, University ofIdaho, Moscow, ID 83843.</TEXT></DOC>
