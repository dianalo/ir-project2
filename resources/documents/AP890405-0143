Addressing a forum on ethical aspects of the technique, a RomanCatholic delegate said the Vatican opposed in vitro fertilization.Jewish, Moslem and Buddhist clerics said the practice could besanctioned within defined limits.   All four religious groups, however, strongly opposed to carryingout experiments on human embryos as well as using sperm, ovum orembryos donated by third parties for implantation in infertilewomen.   ``The mere fact that parents and doctors can play around with anembryo ... is very, very dangerous,'' Sheikh T. Tabari, a Moslemcleric, told doctors from 42 countries at the conference. ``Whyapproach even the boundaries of such dangers?''   Dr. Joseph Schenker, chief gynecologist at Jerusalem's HadassahHospital, said religious opposition to sperm donation was reflectedin its ban in 20 of the 59 countries practicing in vitrofertilization.   He said nations in the Moslem-dominated Arab world and RomanCatholic-dominated South America were among those banning thedonations.   Schenker said donation of female ovum was only practiced in 10countries, among them the United States and Australia.   Tohru Kotaki, a professor of Buddhism from Japan, said thatwhile his religion tolerated test tube fertilization, it opposedsperm, ovum and embryo donation because they could lead to genemanipulation, paid donorship and prejudice against any offspringproduced.   ``We human beings don't have the wisdom to avoid thesepitfalls,'' Kotaki said. ``My standpoint is very conservative: stopthe donation of sperm and ovum.''   Rabbi Shlomo Goren, a former Israeli chief rabbi, said Judaismopposed sperm donation, but exceptions could be made if theidentity of the donor was made known.   ``The donor will always remain the father of the child as far asreligious law is concerned,'' Goren said. He said that among thereasons for Jewish opposition to donorship was that it raisedproblems of identity, including the possibility of incest betweenpeople who did not realize they were related.   Dr. Rudolf Klimek, a Polish gynecologist who represented theRoman Catholic point of view, stated the Vatican's opposition:``The Vatican is against in vitro fertilization as a means ofreproduction, but accepts all babies born of the procedure.''   Klimek said he was working toward a technique for fertilizingeggs inside a woman's body. ``By taking the procedure from in vitroto in vivo, we bring back the dignity,'' he said.   Doctors at the conference called on the clerics to demonstratemore tolerance toward couples faced with infertility.   ``People who come to us want a baby. Most of them are veryreligious,'' said Dr. Jean Cohen of Paris. ``Why don't you come toour clinics, look at our research and make an effort to understandus?''</TEXT></DOC>
