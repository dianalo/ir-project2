At its heart, the idea is a simple one. Japanese cars,video equipment, computers and fax machines have invadedEurope. More are coming. The continent's biggest, mostessential industries -- electronics and cars -- are sick.They need tariff protection and aid money. They also need tocooperate -- and if they don't want to, the EC, according tothis reasoning, should give them a nudge.                                                                                                          It is a tempting idea, especially since much of Europe'sindustry is in a downturn and is worrying about competingwhen internal EC trade barriers come down in 1992. Inpractice, actually enacting industrial policies has provedhard even within France, not to mention EC-wide. But thatisn't stopping the Socialist-led French government frompushing the idea again. Supportive voices can be heard,notably in Latin countries such as Italy.   Can it work? Some people insist it can. Filippo-MariaPandolfi, EC technology commissioner, strongly backed byFrance's state-owned Thomson S.A., wants Europe's mainsemiconductor makers -- SGS-Thomson, Philips Electronics N.V.and Siemens AG -- to join together, an idea Siemens andPhilips resist.   Mrs. Cresson, backed by Peugeot S.A.'s Jacques Calvet,wants to block EC Commission plans for a gradual opening tomore Japanese car imports, and force the EC to enact tougherlimitations. She even is nervous about allowing Japan's NECCorp. to take a 5% stake in state-owned French computer makerCie. des Machines Bull. She fears NEC, as Fujitsu Ltd. didwith Britain's International Computers Ltd., will slowlydevour Bull.   Even EC Commission President Jacques Delors, who insiderssay leans personally toward lifting trade restrictions, ismaking more aggressive noises. At meetings in Tokyo last weekhe warned the Japanese that they had better take Mrs.Cresson's threats seriously. That probably was partly anegotiating ploy, aimed at getting trade concessions. But italso reflects growing pressure on the EC to act.   Trouble is, EC members don't even agree on the merit ofhaving industrial policies, and they are even further fromagreement on what such policies might be. The EC tends to bedivided north-south, with northern members favoring freertrade and southern members favoring more restrictions.   EC Industry Commissioner Martin Bangemann of Germanyinsists he already has an EC commitment to a different kindof &quot;industrial policy&quot; -- one that doesn't target anyindustry for special favors. All 12 EC members last yearagreed instead to pursue efforts to cut taxes, open its ECand foreign markets to more competition and pare governmentbureaucracy -- moves that would benefit all industry.   &quot;There isn't a consensus in the EC for a protectionistindustrial policy,&quot; Mr. Bangemann said in a recent interview.&quot;It wouldn't be accepted by our trading partners and itwouldn't be accepted by a majority of EC members. We couldn'tdo it even if we wanted to.&quot;   Anyhow, he doesn't want to, and the British want to evenless.   Despite these ideological splits, the EC in the past haschosen to dole out special favors to some industries, and notjust farmers. Through aid programs known by patrioticacronyms such as Eureka, the EC and its member nations havespent the equivalent of billions of dollars subsidizingresearch in businesses like computers, semiconductors,television and rocket launching. Member countries have spentbillions more bailing out sick industries like steel and coal-- the two industries that sparked the EC's creation.   But if anything, the EC's experience with industrial aidhas hardened many members' opposition to the idea. Theyquestion whether any of these manifestations of Europeanlargesse did anyone, aside from the few individual workersand researchers who actually received money, any good. Withrare exceptions, such as big-ticket Ariane rockets and Airbusjets, the industries seemed only to slip farther and fartherbehind.   Protection for EC electronics parts makers, for example,has pushed up the prices of EC-made computers, making themless competitive in world markets. The steel bailoutpermitted France to build the world's second-largest steelcompany. But it cost so many tens of billions of francs insubsidies that even French officials today cite it as thekind of horrible mistake no government should ever againmake. No government has that kind of money to spend any more.   Italy is under more pressure from its industry to reducethe government budget deficit than to pump more money intoweak industries. Spain faces a more subtle problem. Itsgrowth over the last five years has benefited from strongJapanese investment, and like Britain and Germany it fearsthat Japan-bashing might make that investment dry up. Even inFrance, many have grave doubts.   &quot;The biggest hindrance to French industry'scompetitiveness right now is a terrible lack of capital, andthe state doesn't have any money to give,&quot; says one Frenchbank economist. &quot;If you look at what French industry needs,the government can't provide it.&quot;</LP><TEXT/></DOC>
