It is importing politicians.   In a move unprecedented in Europe, Italy has allowed citizensfrom all 12 Common Market countries to run on Italian tickets inSunday's European Parliament election.   In addition to the usual offering of political leaders, Italianshave the choice of an Irish nationalist, an exiled Soviet dissidentor a leader of France's 1968 student rebellion. One party even triedto enlist Salman Rushdie, author of the controversial novel ``TheSatanic Verses.''   The candidates are barnstorming Italy, campaigning in French,German, Spanish and English in a sometimes bewildering glimpse ofwhat life could be like in a unified Europe, where people, goods andservices would move freely between the countries.   The new Europe is to be realized by 1992 under an EEC planadopted in 1987.   ``I'd like to know Italian well enough to speak it,'' BritonDavid Steel told a recent Rome campaign rally, speaking Italian witha thick Scottish accent. ``But unfortunately, I'm not able to.Therefore I'll switch to English,'' the Social and Liberal Democratsaid.   Asked if they wanted a translator, the crowd cried, ``No!''However, they looked blank as Steel joked and harangued _ until thetranslator gave it to them in Italian.   Italians are strong supporters of European unity and have one ofthe highest national voting rates for the European Parliament _ 83percent in 1984. A similar percentage of the 47 million eligiblevoters is expected to turn out this time to choose Italy's 81representatives on the 518-member body, comprised of elected membersfrom each EEC nation.   ``Italians do not have a very high opinion of their owngovernment,'' said Ottavio Lavaggi, an Italian member of the Liberalgroup in the European Parliament, which has little day-to-day power.``If tomorrow there is a united Europe, it can't be governed worsethan the Italian government is now. That's one of the origins ofsympathy for this idea of foreigners.''   Putting symbolic figures or famous entertainers on party ticketsis a time-honored practice in Italy, where porn star Ilona``Cicciolina'' Staller sits in Parliament and European Parliamentrepresentatives have included a TV host who ran while under arreston charges of Mafia collaboration.   The candidates, nicknamed ``blood donors'' for their politicalcontributions, are intended to draw votes or prove a point.   The enlisting of foreign candidates is all that and more.   ``It is a component in a certain way linked to the strong`foreign-mania' present in Italy,'' said Arturo Parisi, a professorof political sociology at the University of Bologna.   ``Good or bad, this is a residual of the defeat of the fascistnationalism'' of dictator Benito Mussolini, he said in a telephoneinterview.   He explained that many people were ashamed of the fascist ruleand by its propaganda glorifying Italy. Voters rejectednationalistic themes and were attracted to non-Italian images suchas Europeanism, he said.   Among the imported personalities running is Daniel Cohn-Bendit,known as ``Danny the Red'' for leading the 1968 French studentuprising. He is running on the Greens ticket.   Italy's Social Democrats are running Leonid Plyushch, a Sovietdissident living in France.   Other foreigners include Kalman Domotor de Szeodemeter, aHungarian anti-communist exile living in France, who is running forthe neo-fascist Italian Socialist Movement, and Danny Morrison, amember of Northern Ireland's Sinn Fein, the political arm of theIrish Republican Army. He is running for Italy's far-leftProletarian Democracy party.   Most tickets still are led by traditional Italian politicians.The foreigners are not expected to significantly affect the balanceof the Italian vote, which will likely give the dominant ChristianDemocrats the top position, as they have domestically.   Despite the presence of the foreigners, the campaign has focusedon domestic rather than European politics. The campaign comes in thewake of the collapse of Italy's 48th government, and parties arehoping to show strength to improve their position in negotiationsfor a new government.   Lavaggi says the election of Steel, who is running on thecombined Liberal-Republican-Radical ticket, would be a ``symbolicgesture'' supporting the parties' interest in a more unified Europe.   But he says the nationality of the candidates is not an issue.   ``If you think in the perspective of a united Europe, he (Steel)is a European citizen born in the United Kingdom ... It doesn'traise any problems,'' he said.</TEXT></DOC>
