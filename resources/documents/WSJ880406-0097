Nazer, Saudi Arabia's petroleum minister, was named chairman of Arabian American Oil Co. in a move that further diminishes the role of four major U.S. oil companies in the kingdom's oil industry.    His appointment at a meeting of the Aramco board here represented a major step toward the long-awaited restructuring of Saudi Arabia's oil industry under greater local control.    Mr. Nazer, 56 years old, replaces John J. Kelberer, 62, who becomes vice chairman after 10 years as chairman and chief executive officer of the giant oil-producing company. Ali Naimi, 52, a Saudi who has been president since 1984, will take on the added title of chief executive. Nasir Ajmi, senior vice president, will become executive vice president, a position now vacant.    The Saudi government took over Aramco in stages in the 1970s from the so-called Aramco Four -- Exxon Corp., Texaco Inc., Chevron Corp. and Mobil Corp. -- which had formerly operated Aramco as a partnership. Final payment on compensation to the Aramco Four was made in 1980, although the former shareholders still provide technical and marketing guidance.    &quot;In terms of their expertise, the U.S. companies still play a role,&quot; said one source close to developments. &quot;The Saudis always have been careful about fixing something that isn't broken.&quot;    But the reassignment of Mr. Kelberer leaves only two Americans in operating positions equal to vice president or above at Aramco's headquarters in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia.    Also, total employment of Americans has fallen sharply in recent years. Of Aramco's 42,000 employees in Saudi Arabia, down from 60,000 at the peak, only 2,500 are Americans, down from 6,000 at the peak. More than 32,000 are Saudis. The rest are expatriates.    Announcement of the changes came late yesterday from Aramco Services Co., based in Houston. After attending yesterday's Aramco board meeting here, Mr. Nazer was expected to leave for Mexico this afternoon to meet with Mexican energy officials. After that, he will go to Vienna for a meeting of the price-monitoring committee of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.    Mr. Nazer is one of the five members of the influential committee, whose meeting was called at his request to review world oil prices and OPEC's production levels. The committee can call an emergency meeting of all 13 oil ministers if currently weak oil prices are judged to have diverged far enough from official OPEC levels. But sources said a full conference is unlikely because the next scheduled meeting -- June 8 -- is so soon.    The latest Aramco developments follow other recent steps in a restructuring of the kingdom's oil industry designed to give the Saudis a more direct &quot;hands-on&quot; approach to running the business. Last month, a new U.S.-based company known as Saudi Petroleum International was incorporated in Delaware, with offices in Houston and New York. A sister marketing firm, known as Bolanter, was established in Europe.    These companies, both subsidiaries of Aramco, are expected to handle all international sales of Saudi Arabian crude oil and petroleum products. The former Norbec operation, which assisted in crude sales and in leasing tankers for storage of Saudi oil abroad, is winding down.    Aramco remains the world's biggest crude-oil producing company, with output currently at 4.3 million barrels a day, the Saudi quota under the OPEC production ceiling for the first half of 1988. But another big step in the restructuring of the industry is yet to come, sources close to the kingdom said.    That would involve a resurrection of a decade-old plan to establish a new &quot;umbrella&quot; company, probably to be called Saudi National Oil Corp. Mr. Nazer probably would be named chairman, the sources said. Under this company, Aramco would become a subsidiary responsible for all crude oil production and exports and possibly the exporting of petroleum products processed at Saudi refineries. Petromin, another Saudi concern, would be responsible for production of petroleum products for domestic use.    Also, the new umbrella company, or its subsidiaries, would be responsible for Saudi Arabia's plans to move &quot;downstream&quot; into refining and marketing in the major oil-consuming nations. &quot;There are serious and progressive negotiations under way with major oil companies&quot; for joint refining ventures, a source close to the kingdom said. </TEXT></DOC>
