Aidessaid his campaign spent less than $50,000 on television advertisingin the two states.   The Massachusetts governor took shots at Bush over the issue ofPanamanian leader Manuel Noriega, under indictment in the UnitedStates for drug activities, and collected a stream of endorsementsfrom Democratic Party leaders.   He won the support of seven governors during the week as hepushed his delegate advantage over Jackson to nearly 600.   But Dukakis also spent considerable time dealing with hisstate's looming budget crunch _ a test of his campaign claim thathe is a forceful leader who is not afraid to make tough decisions.   Jackson spent parts of two days in West Virginia and parts ofthree in Nebraska, but his advisers conceded they had little hopeof derailing Dukakis in either state.   Instead, Jackson spent part of the past week in California, hislast plausible chance to slow Dukakis, and directed less firetoward his Demnocratic rival and more toward Bush.   When the vice president referred to Jackson as a ``hustler fromChicago'' _ a phrase that his aides said was meant to praiseJackson for working hard _ Jackson shot back that Bush had``started to panic.''   ``Vice President Bush has begun to call me names,'' he said.``He's trapped in an unholy triangle between the Ayatollah, Noriegaand Meese,'' he said, referring to Iranian Leader AyatollahKhomeini and the Iran-Contra affair, questions about Noriega's drugactivities and the legal difficulties surrounding Attorney GeneralEdwin Meese III.   Increasingly, Jackson portrayed himself as an insurgentcandidate running against the combined forces of Dukakis,Democratic leaders and the pundits.   He appealed to party officials who will attend the DemocraticNational Convention as delegates to wait until the primary campaignends before swinging behind a candidate.   At one point he suggested his supporters might or might not workhard for the Democratic ticket this fall depending on how he wastreated. But he later backed off, saying, ``We need not speak interms of a fight.''   Bush spent little time campaigning in Nebraska or West Virginia,alothough he toured several western states in a week in which heoften seemed to be on the defensive.   His comment about Jackson aside, Bush awoke one morning todiscover two senior aides being quoted in a newsoaper story ascalling Meese a political liability.   ``I must say I am troubled by some of the allegations'' (againstthe attorney general), Bush told reporters, although he said hehadn't authorized either of his aides to speak out.   Asked if he viewed Meese as an albatross on his campaign, Bushreplied, ``An albatross? I don't think so.''   Bush, who headed a drug interdiction task force earlier in theReagan administration, also was confronted with fresh questionsabout when he learned of Noriega's alleged drug activities.   The vice president says he lacked clear knowledge of Noriega'salleged drug involvement before the indictment three months ago.His spokesman, Pete Teeley, says Bush was aware of allegations butregarded them as unsubstantiated.</TEXT></DOC>
