Infarct area, defect score and left ventricularejection fraction (LVEF) were calculated as radionuclide indices of theextent of AMI. Each of these indices significantly correlated with maxCK.The correlation was studied between these indices and cardiac events(death, congestive heart failure, postinfarction angina and recurrenceof AMI) in the first postinfarction year. High-risk patients (nonsurvivorsor patients who developed heart failure) had a larger infarct area, alower LVEF and a larger defect score than the others. Univariate lineardiscriminant analysis was performed to know the optimal threshold ofthese parameters for separation of high-risk patients from the others.Radionuclide parameters obtained in the early phase of AMI were usefulfor the detection of patients with grave complications and also thosewith poor late prognosis during a mean follow-up period of 2.6 years.</TEXT></DOC>
