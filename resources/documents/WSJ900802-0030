The suit specifically accuses Deloitte of ignoring&quot;grossly deficient underwriting&quot; of loans and letters ofcredit at the thrift; of failing to recognize that the thriftwas delaying the recording of losses on nonperforming loansby &quot;parking&quot; the loans with insiders; and of failing todetect violations of federal limits on loans to one borrower.   The new lawsuit against Deloitte is the most recent of thegovernment's aggressive efforts to recoup some of its lossesfrom the failure of FirstSouth. Last year, the governmentobtained $27.6 million through separate settlements withFirstSouth's former law firm, the thrift's officers anddirectors and a now-disbanded Dallas mortgage brokerage firmthat had placed several loans with the thrift.</TEXT></DOC>
