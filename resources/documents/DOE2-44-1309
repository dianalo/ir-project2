This layer protects human beings and allother creatures on earth from hazardous ultraviolet radiation. The kindof freon gas (fluorochloromethane) that may destroy the stratosphericozone layer is one containing no hydrogen atom in it, i. e., completelyhalogenated. This type of freon gas is called chlorofluorocarbon. Theproblem of the destruction of the stratospheric ozone layer was firstpresented in 1974 and has since then attracted the world's attention.Like other countries, Japan has signed the Vienna Treaty for the Protectionof the Ozone Layer and the Montreal Protocol Concerning Materials Destroyingthe Ozone Layer, and has decided to establish the Ozone Layer ProtectionLaw.
