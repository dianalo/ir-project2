Police carrying iron bars and wooden clubs hurled back rocks andunexploded firebombs at about 600 students in the clash atSungkyunkwan University in Seoul, but they used no tear gas becauseof a new government ban.   Several protesters and police were injured, but authorities hadno figures for injuries or arrests.   A declaration by the students said: ``If the Olympics cannothelp nurture a desirable atmosphere, they are nothing but divisiveOlympics, dictatorial Olympics and war Olympics.''   North Korea announced Saturday it would boycott the Sept.17-Oct. 2 Olympics because its demand to be a co-host had beenrejected. It has said for months that it would stay away from theGames if the demand was not met.   North Korea, in a report carried by its official Korean CentralNews Agency, said the Olympics were being used to perpetuate thedivision of the Korean peninsula, and it urged other nations toback its boycott.   ``For us, Olympic Games are important, but more important is thefuture destiny of our entire nation. For this reason, we cannottake part in the Olympic Games that is forced by single-handedhosting,'' said the report, monitored in Tokyo.   The agency, citing a statement released by the north's Olympiccommittee, said the Games will be ``crippled'' by a boycott, butonly Cuba and Ethiopia have said they will back North Korea.   South Korean officials fear the north may try to sabotage theOlympics. The two sides see the Olympics as a major symbol in theirstruggle for dominance on the divided Korean peninsula.   The peninsula was split in 1945. The north invaded the south in1950, starting the Korean War, and the border between the two sidesremains tense years after the 1953 armistice.   In its announcement Saturday, North Korea lashed out at theUnited States, Japan and South Korea, charging they conspired tohold the Games in Seoul to keep the two Koreas apart.   ``By holding the Olympiad in Seoul, they tried to give theimpression (that) South Korea, the complete colony, military baseof the United States, was an `independent state' and legalize theoccupation of South Korea by the U.S. troops.''   The formal deadline for entering the Olympics expired Friday.But the head of the Seoul Olympic Organizing Committee, ParkSeh-jik, said earlier Saturday that Seoul would keep the door openuntil the last day of the Olympics for North Korea to participate.   The International Olympic Committee and South Korea said theGames could not be shared because they are given to a single city.Talks last month failed to produce an agreement between the twoKoreas on the Olympics.   Park also said police would not use tear gas to disperse anyprotests during the Olympics because authorities want to avoiddisruption. The gas used by riot police during demonstrations oftenfloats into residential and business areas, and the government doesnot want to spoil the Games.   Radicals have threatened protests during the Olympics. A smallbut powerful minority on campuses, they lack widespread publicsupport.   Opposition leader Kim Dae-jung said Saturday he doubted that theradicals would attempt to disrupt the Games. ``The students knowthey will not be supported by our people,'' Kim told The AssociatedPress in an interview.   Kim also played down any potential threat from North Korea. Hesaid it would not disrupt the Olympics because it would becondemned worldwide.   The one serious threat appears to be international terrorists,some with ties to North Korea, Kim said.   Some opposition leaders say the government is being moderate toavoid alienating world opinion during the Olympics but that it maycrack down after the Games.   But Kim said that was unlikely. He said President Roh Tae-wooassured him Wednesday that the military would declare itsneutrality in politics. ``We have agreed only democracy can solveour problems,'' he said.   Roh, a former general, defeated Kim and rival opposition leaderKim Young-sam in December presidential elections. Roh replacedformer President Chun Doo-hwan, who took power with militarybacking in 1980.   South Korea has been ruled for most of its 40-year history byauthoritarian military and civilian leaders.</TEXT></DOC>
