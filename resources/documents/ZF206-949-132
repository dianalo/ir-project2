(table)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>By John PallattoandM;Virginia Power Co. is counting on PC-based CASE to improve the productivityand quality of its application-development efforts as the Richmond-basedutility anticipates the deregulation of the power industry in the 1990s.andM;For the nation's third largest producer of nuclear power, the adoption ofcomputer-aided software engineering (CASE) and information-engineeringtechniques is bringing about a major cultural change as managers strive tosell application developers on a new way of working.andM;''[Programmer-analysts] are used to working with IBM mainframes and don't seewhy they have to make a transition to a PC-based workstations,'' explainedJeff Boyle, an information-resource specialist at Virginia Power.andM;''When you tell people that the tools will help them be more productive andimprove the quality of their work, they believe they are being told theyaren't doing a good job,'' he added.andM;But, said Boyle, that's not the reason for the change.andP;  Corporate managementbelieves that CASE will eventually reduce the time spent reworking oldsystems, speed the development of new systems and control development costs.andM;Virginia Power is training 130 systems analysts and programmers to use CASEtools, structured analysis and design methods.andP;  For help in making the move,the company turned to Arthur Young's Information Systems consulting group ofWashington, which developed a manual that fully describes structural analysis-- the process of determining what the client needs from the application.andM;The manual describes the process in the same graphical terms -- pictures andicons -- that analysts will use when working with clients.andM;Using traditional development methods, programmers start writing code beforethey have a complete understanding of what the client wants, the manual'sauthor Richard Anderson observed.andP;  ''If your system doesn't reflect the realworld, the real world is going to come crashing in on your system,'' Andersonsaid.andM;According to Boyle, analysts are now using these procedures when they work onnew applications.andP;  With that in place, the next step is to developstandardized application-design procedures along the same lines as theanalysis procedures, he added.andM;To keep the analysts informed about how the design methods will be drafted,the company's Development Center has appointed a Design Review Team ofanalysts that will supervise the development of the procedures.andM;The Development Center's first project was to create 80286- and 80386-basedCASE workstation that the programmers and analysts can use to develop futureapplications.andP;  At its core, running under DOS 3.3, is KnowledgeWare's Inc.andO;Information Engineering Workstation (IEW) software, which automatesapplication planning, analysis and design.andP;  In addition, each PC is equippedwith such standard applications as WordPerfect, Lotus 1-2-3, Lotus' Freelancegraphics, and Symantec Corp.'s Time Line or Computer Aided Management Inc.'sViewPoint project-management software.andM;Boyle said the company would like to add multitasking capabilities by movingto OS/2 Presentation Manager when IEW supports the new interface.andM;The workstations will be used to develop any new corporate applications.andP;  Thedevelopment center has a couple of projects in the works.andP;  It has justcompleted systems analysis on a system that will perform security clearancechecks on employees.andP;  It is also beginning development of two large marketingand commercial operation applications, which will help the utility gaincompetitive advantages.andM;Future plans for the company include applying CASE technology to thecompany's existing applications, which analysts and programmers spend 65 percent of their time maintaining.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
