Under administrative proceedings begun yesterday, thriftregulators are seeking an accounting of Mr. Keating'sfinances as well as $40.9 million in restitution -- afraction of the $2.5 billion in losses stemming from thefailure of Lincoln Savings andamp; Loan Association.</LP><TEXT>   The regulators also are seeking to remove Mr. Keating aschairman of American Continental Corp., Lincoln's Phoenix,Ariz., parent, along with five other officers. In addition,the regulators also would require Mr. Keating to give themtwo days' notice before transferring assets in excess of$5,000.   &quot;We do not believe his statements to the press or to thepublic that he is broke,&quot; said Timothy Ryan, the director ofthe Office of Thrift Supervision. &quot;There was too much moneythat was available to him, and too short a time for it all todisappear.&quot;   The proceedings began on the first anniversary of thesavings-and-loan cleanup law and federal officials have beenputting the best face possible on the deteriorating mess in aflurry of recent speeches and news briefings.   &quot;This action is literally bolting the barn door after thehorse left,&quot; says Robert Litan of the Brookings Institution,a Washington think tank. &quot;The money is already long gone.This will join the many other cases in which they {theregulators} may get successful judgments, but not any money.&quot;   Lincoln, of Irvine, Calif., was seized by the governmentin April 1989, one day after parent American Continentalfiled for protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of theU.S. Bankruptcy Code.   The amount of restitution is the largest ever sought bythe thrift office, Mr. Ryan said. He added that he didn'tbelieve that 18 months was a long spell before getting agrasp of Mr. Keating's finances. &quot;I think it's promptaction,&quot; Mr. Ryan said, but he added: &quot;I've only been herefour months.&quot; Previously, Mr. Ryan was an attorney at theLabor Department.   An American Continental spokesman, Brad Boland, who is Mr.Keating's son-in-law, said that federal regulators areexplicitly familiar with Mr. Keating's finances through aseparate federal suit filed by the Resolution Trust Corp.   &quot;As usual, when they can't get the results they want in acourt of competent jurisdiction, they resort toadministrative fiat,&quot; he said, adding: &quot;They know everynickel he has.&quot; Mr. Boland said that Mr. Keating's extensivelegal bills are being paid through insurance companies.   The administrative case is being pursued alongside atangle of several other suits between the government and Mr.Keating, who has become a symbol of the high-flying thriftexecutive investing in wild land schemes.   American Continental is in the midst of bankruptcy courtproceedings in Phoenix. The company has sued the thriftoffice in an effort to overturn its seizure of Lincoln.American Continental bondholders have sued the companyalleging fraud. The Resolution Trust Corp. is in the midst ofa $1.1 billion civil racketeering lawsuit against Lincoln.And a grand jury in Los Angeles also is investigating Lincolnfor possible criminal violations. Throughout all of theseproceedings Mr. Keating has consistently denied anywrongdoing.   The administrative case focuses on three transactionsinvolving Mr. Keating and several associates of AmericanContinental. Regulators contend that these transactions piledup the $40.9 million of losses.</TEXT></DOC>
