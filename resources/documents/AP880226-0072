(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A researcher who conducted some of theearliest studies linking cigarettes to cancer was muffled by hissuperiors about the time a tobacco company began making donationsto his institute, according to a confidential document released ina cigarette liability trial.   In the document, a top Philip Morris Co. executive also praisedthe director of the Sloan-Kettering Institute, a leading medicalresearch center, for expressing ``his doubt that smoking isimplicated'' in causing cancer.   The opinion of the director, Dr. Frank Horsfall Jr., was``beneficial'' to the industry, according to the Nov. 23, 1964,memo, which was released Thursday in federal court here.   Morris decided to contribute $25,000 to the New York cancerresearch institute Nov. 8, 1962, and made $25,000 donations thefollowing two years, according to the memo written by James C.Bowling, who was identified in court as an assistant to thecompany's chairman.   ``Substantial contributions'' from five other tobacco companiesfollowed, the memo said.   In the fall of 1962, Horsfall and other institute officialsbegan subjecting the researcher, Ernst Wynder, to a ``more rigorousscreening procedure before letting him speak in the name of theInstitute,'' the memo said.   ``This has had a proper and pleasing effect,'' Bowling's memosaid.   Wynder, one of the first researchers to demonstrate that smokingleads to tumors on mice, was a leading anti-smoking advocate, thememo said.   The memo did not say that Horsfall's attitude or Wynder's``screening'' was a reason for the contributions.   Marc Z. Edell, an attorney representing Antonio Cipollone,introduced the document and about a dozen others in an attempt toshow that tobacco companies treated early studies of smoking'seffect on health as a public relations problem.   In addition, Edell said the companies performed or sponsoredresearch to deflect charges that smoking caused cancer and otherhealth problems.   Edell maintains that Philip Morris Co., Lorillard Inc. andLiggett Group Inc. were liable for the death of Cipollone's wife.Rose Cipollone smoked brands made by the three companies for 40years before she died at 58 in 1984.   Edell contends the companies were liable for her disease byfailing to do enough research, tell customers what they knew or puta safer product on the market.   He introduced the documents Thursday while questioning Morris'former president and chairman emeritus Joseph F. Cullman III for athird day.   The tobacco industry viewed itself as waging ``war'' againstopponents of smoking who linked cigarettes to health hazards in the1960s, according to another document.   That Feb. 12, 1963 memo from the scientific director of atobacco research group to a public relations official spoke of``two `fronts' in our war.''   The memo identified those fronts as activity by the AmericanCancer Society and Britain's Royal College of Physicians, and astudy by the surgeon general, Edell said.   Both the American Cancer Society and the Royal College ofPhysicians were concerned about the health effects of smoking, andthe surgeon general published a report citing the dangers ofcigarettes in 1964.</TEXT></DOC>
