Come and share your viewswith us on PC User's Letters page.andM;NO CURE FROM DRandM;I read with interest the letter from Richard Gibbs of Digital Research, abouthis company's appropriate response on DR-DOS 5.0 problems.andM;I purchased a copy of DR-DOS 5.0 for evaluation in August 1990 from MegatechSoftware.andP;  To begin with I was very pleased, as it seemed to do all thatcould be required of it and more.andP;  However, when I started to use it in aworking environment, it quickly came to light that it failed in many areas.andO;My particular environment consists of a NetWare network and many softwaretools.andP;  The problems seemed to centre around  'shells' and changingdirectories, and also with NetWare's 'MENU' program with a custom menu.andM;These problems were quickly reported to Megatech, complete with snippets ofvarious listings and so on.andP;  Megatech denied receiving the first fax of allthese problems but it did get the second.andP;  After a large number of phonecalls from me, Megatech said it had referred it all to DR. I must also sayhere that Megatech wasn't very helpful, saying outright that some of theproblems were caused by the Microsoft 'C' compiler making  dirty' calls intothe operating system.andP;  Any support team that can say this is, well!....andM;Of course nothing happened and I eventually had to make a report recommendingthat DR-DOS 5.0 not be used internally, especially in a NetWare environment,as it seems very flaky and helpful support seems non-existent.andM;In conclusion, I now do not recommend anyone to take this product onboard.andO;Also, support from the dealers is worse than non-existent, as one can wastemuch time in the process and in the end get nowhere.andP;  I must admit, however,to being disappointed, as the product seemed to have much potential and we'rein need of something like it.andP;  I expect we'll use the new MS-DOS replacementwhich is rumoured to have similar capabilities and hopefully will also work.andM;If DR would like to contact me directly then I'd be pleased, maybe, toexplain aH the problems again.andM;Brian CottonandM;SonyandM;HampshireandM;DEAD AS OLD DR-DOSandM;I've observed with interest the development and progress of DigitalResearch's DOS up to the current DR-DOS 5.0 and even went to the length ofbuying an earlier version which seemed to show advantages over the MS-DOS 3.2which was then in use.andM;DR-DOS is actually quite nice, but the claimed advantages when boded downwere essentially that one could have a king-size hard disk without needing alarge number of partitions.andP;  That advantage no longer applies with DOS 4.01,so very little is to be gained.andM;Few PC owners won't have a text editor in their WP if needed, and anyway isEDLIN really so bad?andM;On the con side are the dreaded incompatibilities.andP;  MS-DOS is what au DOSprograms have been written for and little glitches can cause considerablegrief.andP;  We had to abandon DR-DOS as our Networking software - Lansmart -wasn't supported, so DR-DOS plainly isn't DOS-compatible.andM;While we had it, it seemed worth a closer look.andP;  So, we set up a typicalconfig.sys invoking an expanded memory driver, ansi.sys, disk cache,himem.sys, installed share (for the big disk) bunged in a few files andbuffers, then loaded up Superkey and Sidekick, using a Taiwanese PC clone.andO;We then loaded Framework and ran DataEase in the DOS access mode from withinFramework - this works trouble-free on MS-DOS, even on the network.andM;We spent a merry afternoon un-hanging computers with DR-DOS and thenabandoned the exercise.andP;  I feel that even if it had worked we wouldn't reallyhave been any better off.andM;Still - keep up the good work; PC User is greeted with much enthusiasm.andM;Barry BakerandM;TremiverandM;BasingstokeandM;Digital Research replies: Thank you for giving us the opportunity of replyingto both Brian Cotton and Barry Baker's letters.andP;  In issue 148.3 we statedthat end users experiencing difficulties could expect an immediate andappropriate response from Digital Research.andM;I'm disappointed that this wasn't Mr Cotton's experience and would like toapologise.andP;  We're committed to resolving any customer concern, and providingtechnical support on DR-DOS 5.andP;  0 direct to the user, where that supportisn't available from a dealer.andM;Mr Baker's comments centre around DR-DOS 3.41.andP;  DR-DOS 5.0 bas been availablenow for eight months and leads the way in DOS technology, as PC User andother leading journals have readily acknowledged.andP;  One feature of DR-DOS 5.0is that it can solve the  'RAM cram' problem by freeing up to 620Kb of memoryfor applications.andP;  As it would appear that Mr Baker is unaware of thesignificant advantages of DR-DOS 5.0, if be would like to contact me direct Ishall be happy to send him an evaluation copy.andM;DR-DOS 5.0 is an extremely serious product Novell bas issued a data sheetdemonstrating the advantages of using DR-DOS 5.0 with NetWare.andM;I'm grateful for this opportunity to set the record straight'.andP;  Helen Tizard,Marketing Manager Northern Europe, Tel  (0635) 35304</TEXT></DOC>
