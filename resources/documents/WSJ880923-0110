Chemical, which said in May that it wanted to sell this operation, is &quot;very close to a deal&quot; with Dumenil-Leble, both sides say. Officials stressed, however, that Chemical is not selling its Swiss branches and in fact is beefing up its foreign exchange and money-market trading operations there.    The private banking activities sought by Dumenil-Leble are principally involved in fund and portfolio management, and handle assets of about 1.5 billion Swiss francs ($947.9 million). Started in 1984, the operation employs 35 people in Geneva, Zurich and Lugano. The value of the possible transaction, which would still have to be approved by Swiss banking authorities, isn't known.    The move would make a neat fit for both sides as New York-based Chemical is seeking to pare its private banking activities outside the Americas while DumenilLeble is trying to develop and expand internationally its presence in the field.    In May, Chemical announced plans to focus its world-wide private banking efforts on the U.S. and Latin America. Last month, it announced the sale of its Hong Kong and Singapore private-banking interests to Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring andamp; Pierson.    Under its new chairman, Jacques Letertre, Dumenil-Leble has been concentrating largely on trading, money management and acquiring influential stakes in companies since last year's stock market crash. Dumenil-Leble now considers money-management the backbone of its activities, and says it wants to double the assets it manages to 30 billion French francs ($4.71 billion) in two years.    The group, in which Carlo De Benedetti's French holding company Cerus SA took a 25% stake this year, has been in the news recently for a number of spectacular acquisitions and divestitures. Early this year, Dumenil participated with Mr. De Benedetti in his raid on Societe Generale de Belgique before selling its 10.8% stake to the Italian financier for a capital gain of 165 million French francs. More recently, it agreed to sell its 41% stake in Rivaud for almost double what it paid in 1987.    Dumenil is already present in Switzerland through GDL Capital Partners, a trading unit. </TEXT></DOC>
