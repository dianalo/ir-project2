The silver-haired arbitragerpaid $100 million in fines and restitution and agreed to pleadguilty to one count of lying to federal regulators to settle hiscase on Nov. 14, 1986. His cooperation with prosecutors has yieldeda mother lode of investigations and prosecutions. Now serving athree-year prison sentence in Lompoc, Calif., Boesky is eligible forrelease in April 1990.   _MICHAEL R. MILKEN, 43, former head of junk-bond trading atDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc., faces a 1990 trial on racketeering andfraud charges for a series of alleged schemes, most with Boesky.Milken, who is credited with creating the $200 billion market forjunk bonds, resigned from Drexel in June to form his own consultingfirm. He has pleaded innocent and plans a court fight, which isexpected to include testimony by his chief accuser, Boesky.   _DENNIS LEVINE, 36, was paroled last September after serving 17months of a two-year prison term for securities fraud, tax evasionand perjury. The original target in the recent crackdown, Levine'sconfessions about a broad insider trading ring led prosecutors toBoesky. The former Drexel managing director, who accepted satchelsof money and arranged deals from pay phones, pleaded guilty to fourfelonies and returned $11.6 million in alleged illegal profits.Levine told a group of business students this year he has formed amergers and acquisitions consulting firm. ``I'm sorry I broke thelaw,'' he said.   _MARTIN SIEGEL, 40, pleaded guilty in 1987 to illegal stocktrading and tax evasion while head of mergers and acquisitions atKidder, Peabody andamp; Co. He also agreed to return $9 million in cashand securities to settle civil charges for his role in illegaldealings with Boesky. Siegel, also a former Drexel managingdirector, named names for the government and is expected to besentenced by the end of the year.   _BOYD L. JEFFERIES, 58, the workaholic Los Angeles stockbrokersnared in the Boesky web, in July was placed on probation and fined$250,000 after two years of helping the government. He pleadedguilty to two felony counts in 1987 and then testified in the trialsof GAF Corp. and corporate raider Paul Bilzerian. Jefferies, whoadmitted to a stock concealment scheme with Boesky, was banned fromthe securities business for five years but plans eventually toreturn to the brokerage that bears his name.   _PAUL A. BILZERIAN, 39, the Florida investor with mutton-chopsideburns, in September was sentenced to four years in prison forhis conviction on nine counts of securities fraud, conspiracy andmaking false statements, and fined $1.5 million. The sentence forthe former Singer Co. chairman was the stiffest so far. Bilzerian,who seized control of Singer in a $1.06 billion deal but has steppeddown as chairman, continues to deny the charges and is free pendingappeal.   _STEPHEN WANG JR., 25, recently was released after serving eightmonths in prison for a September 1988 guilty plea to mail, wire andsecurities fraud. The former Morgan Stanley andamp; Co. junior analystallegedly made $200,000 from a multimillion-dollar insider tradingscheme. ``You had a brilliant future and you blew it,'' a judge toldhim at sentencing. Wang is ``trying to get his life back in order,''his attorney, Ira Lee Sorkin, said.   _ROBERT FREEMAN, 46, former head of arbitrage for Goldman, Sachsandamp; Co., was arrested along with two other executives for insidertrading in the most dramatic of the government's string of cases.Implicated by Siegel, Freeman negotiated for his future after thegovernment failed to bring an indictment. In August, he agreed toplead guilty to one felony count and is awaiting sentencing.

FOSTER WINANS, 41, is the former Wall Street Journal reporterwho was convicted of passing on tips from his ``Heard on theStreet'' column to a stockbroker in a failed get-rich-quick schemethat predated the Boesky era.
