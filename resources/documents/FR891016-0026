Each unit willhave an output of approximately 3 megawatts (MW).</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT: </T2>Joseph R.

The information supplied by NCEMC is containedin a Borrower's Environmental Report (BER) which was a primary source documentused by REA to develop its Environmental Assessment (EA). REA has concludedthat the EA represents an accurate assessment of the environmental impactsof the two proposed projects and that the impacts are acceptable.NCEMC proposes to install diesel electric generating units at existinggeneration sites which are owned by two member cooperatives. Initially,four units would be installed at the headquarters facility of Cape HatterasElectric Membership Corporation (Cape Hatteras) which is located withinthe town of Buxton on Hatteras Island. Space would be provided for a fifthunit. The existing power station building would be reconstructed to accommodatethe new units. The four existing diesel units at Buxton (not operating)would be removed. An above ground fuel oil storage tank with a capacityof 68,130 liters (18,000 gallons) would be installed adjacent to threeexisting fuel oil storage tanks. A new 34 kilovolt (kV) bus would be addedto the existing on-site substation.One unit would be installed at the district facility of Tideland ElectricMembership Corporation (Tideland) which is located within the town of Ocracokeon Ocracoke Island. A 1.2 MW diesel unit with associated facilities isoperating on site. These facilities would be retained. A building to housethe new unit would be constructed and a 56,775 liters (15,000 gal) aboveground fuel oil storage tank would be installed adjacent to two existingtanks. Additional 12.5 kV breakers would be added to the existing switchyard.All new facilities would be located within existing site boundaries atboth Buxton and Ocracoke.REA has concluded that the proposed projects will have no effect on importantfarmland, prime forest land or rangeland, wetlands, threatened or endangeredspecies or critical habitat, and properties listed or eligible for listingin the ``National Register of Historic Places''. The Buxton project willnot impact Buxton Woods or the Pea Island National Wildlife Refuge. Neitherproject will impact the Cape Hatteras National Seashore. The placementof the generation facilities on Ocracoke within the 100-year floodplainis unavoidable, but raising the foundation will minimize floodplain impacts.Predicted worse case impacts from stack emissions are substantially belowcorresponding National Ambient Air Quality Standards on all averaging periodsat each site. No Prevention of Significant Deterioration Permit will berequired. The use of sound absorbing materials and noise silencers willensure that noise regulations are not exceeded. No other matters of environmentalconcern have come to REA's attention.Alternatives examined for the proposed projects included no action, highervoltage transmission lines, conservation and load management, alternativegeneration facilities and alternative sites. REA determined that thereis a need for the proposed projects and that constructing the facilitiesas recommended is an environmentally acceptable alternative for NCEMC tofurnish an isolated part of its service area with a reliable supply ofpower for peak shaving and emergency situations.Based upon the environmental support information provided, REA preparedan EA concerning the proposed projects and their impacts. As a result ofits independent evaluation, REA has concluded that approval for NCEMC toconstruct facilities would not constitute a major Federal action significantlyaffecting the quality of the human environment. Therefore, REA has madea FONSI with respect to the two proposed projects. The preparation of anenvironmental impact statement is not necessary.Copies of REA's EA, FONSI, and NCEMC's BER can be obtained from the officesof REA in the South Agriculture Building, Room 0250, 14th and IndependenceAvenue SW., Washington, DC 20250; or at the office of North Carolina ElectricMembership Corporation, (Wayne D. Keller, Interim Executive Vice President),3400 Sumner Boulevard, Raleigh, North Carolina 27611, during regular businesshours. Copies of the documents are available for review at Cape Hatteras'office in Buxton and the Tideland's office in Ocracoke.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: October 5, 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">John H.
