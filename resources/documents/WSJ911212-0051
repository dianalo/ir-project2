Most peoplewanting to display photos on their computer screens, orinclude them in printed documents, had to first take thephoto with a regular camera, then place it into a &quot;scanner,&quot;a specialized copying machine that translates photos intocomputer digital code. The two-step method works, but can betime-consuming, costly and tricky.</LP><TEXT>   Now, two companies have begun selling versions of a small,portable, one-step &quot;digital&quot; camera -- a simple device thatcreates a computerized photo image and transmits it to acomputer using no film, tape, floppy disks or separateequipment. The cameras, which share the same basic design andare both U.S.-made, list for under $1,000, and at least oneversion is expected to be available soon from discounters foras little as $600.   Operating one of the new digital cameras couldn't besimpler: Charge up its battery, take it wherever yoursubjects are and snap as many as 32 pictures. You then popthe camera into a small base unit plugged into your computer,and launch the special software (included with the camera)that extracts the pictures from the camera's built-in memorychips and sends them to to the computer's memory.   In a flash, the pictures appear on the screen, at first aslittle thumbnail images, then as fullsize photos. You cansave the images as standard graphics files on your hard disk,edit them to alter their appearance and print them out on alaser printer. Once saved on a disk, the pictures can be usedby any software programs -- such as the newest wordprocessors -- that can mix text and graphics in a singledocument.   That means businesses and individuals producingnewsletters, reports and other material on their computerscan include photos of their products, people, buildings oranything else. Pictures of objects in inventory can be storedon the computer for insurance purposes. Employees' picturescan be stored on disk with personnel records. Realtors canstore pictures of houses.   The two cameras are essentially the same product soldunder different names. Dycam, a small Chatsworth, Calif.,company, developed the camera and sells it as the Dycam I,with a list price of $995. The company says it's availablefrom dealers for about $900.                                                                                                          Logitech, a big computer products company in Fremont,Calif., has licensed the camera design from Dycam and begunits own production line. It recently began shipping thecamera as the Logitech FotoMan, with a list price of $799,and estimates discount dealers and mail-order houses willcarry it for about $600.   For now, both versions are hard to find. Dycam isn't adistribution powerhouse, and many dealers don't carry itsversion. Logitech has a broad distribution network, but hasonly been shipping its FotoMan for a few weeks, so the camerais still scarce at stores and mail-order houses. That shouldchange in coming months.   Though the cameras are twins, they come with distinctsoftware and connection options. Dycam's version includessoftware and cables that enable it to be used withIBM-compatible computers -- either with or withoutMicrosoft's Windows software -- and with Apple's Macintoshcomputers. The current Logitech FotoMan works only withIBM-compatibles running Windows, but the company promises toship a Macintosh version early next year.   The cameras, being first-generation devices, do havelimitations. They take only black-andwhite pictures, and inseveral weeks of testing both cameras, I found their photosto be far grainier and less satisfying than regular photos.On a typical laser printer, the photos were good enough formost newsletters, but professional photographers will turn uptheir noses.                                                                                                          The cameras' optics are primitive. There's a single,fixed-focus lens (telephoto and wide-angle adapters areavailable at extra cost). And, even with an included sunlightfilter, pictures often had badly overexposed and underexposedareas. Extreme close-ups are impossible, and some of my shotswere out of focus. The Dycam unit attached to my Mac keptshooting pictures by itself, in the middle of the night.   To get a decent picture requires extensive use of touch-upsoftware to lighten and darken various areas, sharpen images,increase contrast, and crop and resize photos. Both camerasinclude such software, but Logitech's program -- calledFotoTouch -- is far more elegant, powerful and easier to use.Dycam owners are likelier to need to buy separate, costlysoftware.   For more technically minded computer users, an older,nondigital camera technology is available. Canon sells aspecial &quot;still&quot; video camera called the Xap Shot, whichrecords images, black and white or color, on a tiny internaldisk. But it requires a two-step process, involving the useof a separate device called a &quot;digitizer&quot; that translates theimage into computer code. This indirect method can hurtpicture quality and intimidate average computer users.   Based on its price, simplicity, and software, the LogitechFotoMan is the best choice for putting photos into computerdocuments, provided you have an IBM-compatible PC capable ofrunning Microsoft's Windows. Macintosh owners must either buythe Dycam or wait for Logitech's promised Mac version.</TEXT></DOC>
