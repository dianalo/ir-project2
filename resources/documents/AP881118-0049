The prisoners have completed their sentences and are beingdeported only because they arrived in the Mariel boatlift in 1980,Penalver said.   But George Calhoun, director of the Justice Department's Marielreview program, said the 15 prisoners have been convicted in theUnited States of crimes ranging from murder and armed robbery toarson and rape, and can legally be deported as undesirable aliens.   The detainees were among 125,000 people who came to the UnitedStates in the 1980 boatlift, and most have become law-abiding U.S.residents. Many were criminals and mentally ill people released byCuban President Fidel Castro.   The Justice Department said Thursday it would wait at least 72hours before deporting the detainees, who are being held in strictlockdown in a prison in Talladega, Ala. They will be flown to Cuba``in the fairly near future,'' Calhoun said.   Attorneys said they would file a lawsuit today in federal courtin Birmingham, Ala., charging that the deportations would violateU.S. guarantees of due process under the law.   The task force, organized by Miami's Roman Catholic AuxiliaryBishop Agustin Roman, met to plan further action to stop thedeportations.   Roman and Penalver were credited with negotiating an end to thefederal prison riots a year ago in Atlanta and Oakdale, La. Therioting began after announcement of a U.S. agreement with FidelCastro to resume deportations.   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has paroled about2,400 of 3,822 detainees held at that time. About 400 others havebeen approved for parole and are awaiting release, said INSspokesman Duke Austin. Those denied parole received a special review.   Cary Copeland, a deputy associate attorney general, said thedepartment is reviewing the cases of about 500 more federal Marieldetainees, and several hundred more serving sentences in state andlocal jails will receive reviews.</TEXT></DOC>
