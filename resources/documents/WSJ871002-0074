The failed banks were: Western Bank-Westheimer, Houston, which had assets of $290.9 million; Western Bank-Westwood, Houston, which had assets of $46.9 million; Western Bank-North Wilcrest, Houston, which had assets of $44.8 million; Security State Bank, Oxford, Neb., which had assets of $11.3 million; and Clay County State Bank, Dilworth, Minn., which had assets of $10.5 million. The three Houston banks were under the same ownership.    Western Bank-Westheimer held $259.9 million in 14,459 deposit accounts. The FDIC said its insured deposits will be transferred to Charter National Bank, Houston, and its only office will reopen Monday as a branch of Charter National.    The insurance agency said Western Bank-Westheimer held $35.9 million in 621 accounts that exceeded the $100,000 federal insurance limit. Of that, $27.7 million was funds from the other two affiliated banks that failed yesterday. The FDIC said uninsured depositors will share proportionately with the FDIC in proceeds from the liquidation of the bank's assets.    The FDIC said depositors of both Western Bank-Westwood and Western Bank-North Wilcrest, both closed by the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency, automatically will become depositors of Texas Commerce Bank, also of Houston. Western Bank-Westwood held deposits of $44.8 million in 1,942 accounts. Western Bank-North Wilcrest held $43.8 million in 2,301 deposit accounts. The failed banks' offices won't reopen.    A total of 42 Texas banks have failed so far this year.    Security State's sole office, closed by the Nebraska director of banking, is to reopen today as a branch of Union Bank andamp; Trust Co., Lincoln, Neb. Security State, which held $11 million in 2,909 deposit accounts, was the first bank to fail this year in Nebraska.    Clay County State's two offices, closed by the Minnesota commissioner of commerce, are to reopen today as branches of Northwestern State Bank, Ulend, Minn. Clay County State held deposits of $10.2 million in 3,700 accounts, and was the ninth Minnesota bank to fail.    The 141 bank failures nationwide so far this year eclipse the previous record of 138, set last year. FDIC officials expect as many as 200 banks to fail by the end of this year. </TEXT></DOC>
