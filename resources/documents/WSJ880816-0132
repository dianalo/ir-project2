Browning (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> EUROP </CO><IN> PET </IN><DATELINE> PARIS  </DATELINE><TEXT>   When Louis Prudhomme began exploring for oil within the Paris city limits two years ago, some people questioned his sanity.    &quot;One morning at about 3 a.m., when we were making seismic tests in a residential neighborhood, a lady came down in her nightgown and curlers,&quot; recalls the Elf Aquitaine S.A. engineer. She asked what all the trucks and men were doing. When she found out, says Mr. Prudhomme, &quot;she came up to me and said, 'you must be out of your mind.'&quot;    Crazy or not, Mr. Prudhomme and his Elf colleagues went on with their geological research, conducted primarily overnight to avoid disturbing Paris's already horrific traffic. They sent seismic signals deep into the earth's crust and mapped the locations of likely oil deposits throughout the Paris metropolitan region.    Last week their nocturnal explorations paid off. In a vacant lot on the outskirts of this centuries-old city, Elf began drilling the Paris region's first oil well.    The well is still exploratory, and it will be two weeks more before Elf learns if there is oil to pump. As a rule, only one exploratory well in 10 produces oil, Elf officials note. Even if this one is a gusher, no one expects to find enough to make this city Riyadh-on-the-Seine.    But Elf officials can barely control their excitement. Geological studies suggest they may find oil not only in a large swath on the city's southern edge, but also at Orly and Charles de Gaulle airports.    &quot;Before now,&quot; gushes Mr. Prudhomme, &quot;no one dared to explore in the Paris region, with its 10 million people, its subway lines, its gardens, homes, sewers and monuments. But our geologists were convinced and we went ahead.&quot;    The new rig stands 150 feet tall in the industrial suburb of Ivry, just outside the city's southeast border. It may not be chic, but for the rig workers, who are used to the heat of Angola, Indonesia and the Middle East, even gray Ivry has its charms.    &quot;From the platform you can see the Eiffel Tower -- or at least part of it,&quot; says Jean-Jacques Hastoy, who recently returned from Angola.    It would have been more efficient to drill about two-thirds of a mile farther east, in a more residential area. But to avoid disturbing people as much as possible, Elf went to industrial Ivry, which means that it has to drill at an angle, under the Seine River. Even the Ivry location is opposite two apartment houses, whose residents aren't pleased with the derrick's continuous screeching.    &quot;Sure they've complained about the well,&quot; says Arezki Aziz, who runs a cafe around the corner. &quot;They complained about the noise when Le Monde built its {nearby} printing plant, too.&quot;    Mr. Aziz, who seems to have caught oil fever, says he doesn't mind the disturbance. &quot;I hear that Paris is full of oil,&quot; he says. &quot;I hope they find it here. Maybe I'll get a discount. Or maybe they'll find it in my back yard. If so, they'll have to pay me a pretty price for it.&quot;    Not everyone thinks oil wells in Paris are such a great idea. Elf officials say the keeper of the Vincennes Zoo, in southeast Paris, worried that seismic testing would disturb the ostrich eggs the zoo was trying to hatch. The manager of a public aquarium expressed worries for his fish.    Meanwhile, Elf employees seem to be enjoying the task. After dining on &quot;the best frog legs in Paris,&quot; Lars Froybu, a Norwegian who specializes in exploratory drilling, says: &quot;This is civilization. For me, this isn't really drilling.&quot;    When the exploration here ends in October, he expects to be sent to Gabon. </TEXT></DOC>
