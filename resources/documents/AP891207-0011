In the Soviet Union, East Germany, Hungary and Poland, there aresigns of nationalism and anti-Semitism that suggest the fourdecades of Communist rule suppressed traditional hatreds instead oferadicating them.   Since Mikhail S. Gorbachev allowed more openess and lifted ironcontrols on dissent, ethnic and racial hatreds have resurfaced inMoslem Central Asia and in the Caucasus republics of the SovietUnion. Ethnic violence there has killed more than 300 people.   Azerbaijan and Armenia are in conflict over the Nagorno-Karabakhregion and the Baltic republics are gripped by growing nationalistsentiment.   Writing in the current issue of Foreign Affairs, ZbigniewBrzezinski says that although communism ``proclaimed itself to be adoctrine of internationalism, communism in fact intensified popularnationalist passions.''   The former U.S. national security adviser noted that whilePoland and Hungary are the most ethnically cohesive countries inEastern Europe, Yugoslavia and Czechoslovakia are diverse societiesand both Romania and Bulgaria have substantial national minorities.   ``Moreover, all these states have borders that are potentiallysubject to revisionist aspirations on the part of theirneighbors,'' he wrote.   In the Soviet Union, activity by Pamyat, a nationalist Russiansociety, also has picked up in this new era. Pamyat, with itsextremist, xenophobic outlook, is operating openly in a number ofmajor Russian cities.   In Vienna, Soviet artist Tanya Loskutova said in a recentinterview that Gorbachev's campaign of openness had succeeded inunearthing hatreds that had lurked under the surface for decades.   ``Anti-Semitism has become much more obvious, because there isnow a great opportunity to spit out the dirt that people hadinside,'' said Ms. Loskutova, a Jew who emigrated in October andhopes to settle in the United States.   The sudden removal of constraints on freedom of expression haspermitted organizations like Pamyat to step up anti-Jewishcampaigns.   In Hungary too, overt anti-Semitism appears to be morepronounced since the country initiated reforms about two years agothat are meant to transform it into a full democracy.   But representatives of Hungary's Jewish community of 60,000 seemto feel the racist sentiment _ expressed through the desecration ofsynagogues and in anti-Semitic outbursts at soccer matches _ is noton the rise.   They say it's just becoming more visible.   ``Anti-Semitism has been with us all these four decades, but itwas forbidden to discuss it openly,'' Chief Rabbvi Alfred Schoenersaid in an interview.   More worrying to Jews is that political reforms have beenaccompanied by the kind of growing nationalism that in the past hasbeen linked to the persecution of Jews.   The popularity of the Hungarian Democratic Forum, a mainopposition party that has gained support by exploiting tensionswith Romania over Transylvania and the fate of ethnic Hungarians inthe Romanian territory, is therefore a cause of worry for some Jews.   Gyoergy Konrad, a writer of Jewish origin, likes to relate howhis mother once told him: ``My boy, be careful, because once theystart talking about Transylvania, they'll be deporting Jews soon.''   Government figures and the Hungarian media have also raisednationalist themes in an attempt to gain popularity. The result isembarassing some members of Hungarian minority groups living inneighboring countries.   ``The media in Budapest are hurting us here with false reportsof a mass autonomy movement in Slovakia,'' Andras Szemere, a memberof Czechoslovakia's 500,000-strong Hungarian minority told aWestern visitor to Bratislava recently. ``Sure, we have ourproblems _ all minorities do everywhere _ but right now we're moreinterested in working with the Czechs and Slovaks and getting ridof the Communists.''   In Poland, there have been scattered incidents of anti-Semitismpreceding elections that gave the country its first government infour decades not dominated by the Communists.   People scribbled the word ``Jew'' on campaign posters ofSolidarity activist Jacek Kuron, who is not Jewish.   There are also reports that prominent Solidarity activist andintellectural Bronislaw Geremek was passed over for the Polishpremiership because he is Jewish.   In East Germany, where decades of isolation have fallen awaywith the opening of the Berlin Wall, fears focus on the importationof racist sentiments.   At a meeting with Jewish community leaders Nov. 27, East Germansecurity officials contended that leaflets distributed by WestGermany's ultra-rightist Republican Party have appeared withincreasing frequence in East Germany since border controls wereloosened Nov. 9.   ``Since the opening of the borders to the West, a rise inactivities of neo-Nazi groups in the direction of East Germany canbe noticed,'' the official ADN news agency said in a report on themeeting.   Even Romania, the last bastion of Stalinism in the Soviet bloc,is exploiting some of the unsolved ethnic problems.   In an apparent attempt to deflect attention from his owncountry's economic and human rights record, President NicolaeCeausescu recently suggested the return of the former Bessarabia,now Soviet Moldavia, which Romania lost during World War II.</TEXT><NOTE>EDITOR'S NOTE </NOTE><TEXT>   George Jahn has covered Eastern European affairsfor the AP since 1982 and is now stationed in Vienna.</TEXT></DOC>
