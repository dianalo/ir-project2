The lead singer for The Pretenders had infuriated the fast-foodchain by her joking reply when asked what she had done for theenvironmental group Greenpeace. ``I firebombed McDonald's,'' shesaid last week.   Police say they may want to interview Miss Hynde, who is a strictvegetarian, in connection with a firebomb attack on a McDonald's insuburban Milton Keynes last weekend.   McDonald's threatened to take legal action against the singer,who has frequently spoken out against McDonald's in the past, unlessshe gave assurances that she would not repeat the inflammatoryremark.   In a statement worked out by lawyers for the two parties, MissHynde insisted Monday that her remarks Thursday at analbum-promoting Greenpeace news conference had been taken out ofcontext.   ``However, I am prepared to give an unequivocal undertaking thatI will at no time suggest or imply that I have been responsible forfirebombing McDonald's or that anyone should firebomb or cause anyother physical or personal damage to the customers, employers,franchises or the physical property of McDonald's Restaurants Ltd.or any of its associated companies anywhere in the world.''   McDonald's said it was satisfied with the statement and wouldtake no further legal action.   No one was injured in Saturday's attack in Milton Keynes, andDetective Chief Inspector Alan Partridge said Monday he had notdecided whether it was necessary to interview Miss Hynde.
