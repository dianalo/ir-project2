Also instrumental in the release was a letter to Gorbachev writtenby former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, CBS said.;    The four talkedabout their ordeal Sunday on the network's news magazine show, &quot;60 Minutes.&quot;;   &quot;They beat us with canes, with sticks, on the legs, on the head, and theydid something that came straight from so many grade B movies that we have allseen,&quot; Simon said of his captors.;    &quot;I was in a room being interrogated. Iknew my three friends were outside the room in a hall. The door was closed. .. . But when they were getting to these important questions, they opened thedoor and they beat Juan, Peter and Roberto so they would scream and I wouldhear them scream while they were asking me questions and beating me at thesame time.&quot;;    Bluff, the producer and chief of CBS's London bureau, said: &quot;Iremember a couple of canes breaking over my head. . . . It's the shock of it.. . . You are in the dark because you're behind the blindfold. You've beenmessed around for probably eight to nine hours prior to that. It's dark. Evenif the blindfold came off . . . you wouldn't know where you were anyway, evenif it wasn't dark.&quot;;    The beatings were not severe, said a doctor whoexamined them in London.;    CBS had asked reporters covering the story ofSimon and his crew to withhold the fact that Simon was a Jew based in Israel,but his captors knew, Simon said.;    &quot;An army . . . captain . . . he grabbedme by the face and forced my mouth open and said, 'Yehudi, Yehudi,' (whichmeans Jewish), and then he spit at me and slapped me,&quot; Simon recalled. &quot;Ididn't think he would shoot me. (But) I could have killed him. I would havekilled him if I could. I would have killed him, and I would have had no moreremorse than I had when I . . . killed a cockroach in my room.&quot;;    The fouralmost were killed at one point by an allied bombing raid on Baghdad, theysaid.;    &quot;I heard the plane. Then I heard the bomb coming. The sounds wereincredible, and I knew it was coming to me. So I just crouched into a corner,&quot;recalled Caldera, who is a free-lancer, not a CBS staffer. &quot;Rubble fell allover me. Half the room was absolutely gone.&quot;;    Caldera made his way toSimon's room. Bluff, the producer, tried to ease their fears. &quot;We are notdead. We are not dead,&quot; he reminded them.;    For most of their captivity,time passed slowly, they said.;    &quot;(I) spent time talking,&quot; Alvarez said. &quot;Italked a lot -- whispered -- about everything: plans when I got out, myfamily, my son, about food.&quot; Alvarez's dreams of food became so intense he hadto finally force himself to stop them.;    Simon dreamed of food, too, in deepdaytime trances. &quot;At one point, I heard someone brought up onto the floor,&quot; herecalled. &quot;I heard him being kicked. Four times. But I was so deep at thatmoment -- I was walking down Broadway with an ice cream in one hand andpopcorn in the other -- that I couldn't pay attention to the kicking. Youdevelop defense mechanisms you don't know you are capable of.&quot;;    The fourwere captured Jan. 21 at the Kuwaiti border by three Iraqi soldiers whospotted them at an abandoned customs checkpoint and sped in a lone jeep acrossthe desert to take them.;    &quot;We weren't after the story of the war,&quot; Simonsaid, about why they had gone off without a military escort. &quot;We weren't afteran enormous scoop. We just wanted to check out what was going on.&quot;  </TEXT><BYLINE>  Los Angeles Times  </BYLINE><COUNTRY>  USA  </COUNTRY><CITY>  Washington  </CITY><EDITION>  Morning Final  </EDITION><CODE>  SJ  </CODE><NAME>  SAN JOSE MERCURY NEWS  </NAME><PUBDATE>   910304  </PUBDATE> <DAY>  Monday  </DAY><MONTH>  March  </MONTH><PG.COL>  7A  </PG.COL><PUBYEAR>  1991  </PUBYEAR><REGION>  WEST  </REGION><FEATURE>  PHOTO  </FEATURE><STATE>  CA  </STATE><WORD.CT>  768  </WORD.CT><DATELINE>  Monday March 4, 199100064091,SJ1  </DATELINE><COPYRGHT>  Copyright 1991, San Jose Mercury News  </COPYRGHT><LIMLEN>  1  </LIMLEN><LANGUAGE>  ENG  </LANGUAGE></DOC>
