Our national security requires that sensitive or defenserelated American technology be protected where necessary. However, Americantechnology is an essential part of this country's international trade.Together with other companies in the audience, Gilbert hopes to contributeto restoring a favorable balance in U.S. trade with other countries.This objective is, however, frustrated to a substantial degree by Americanregulatory requirements which are unnecessary, outdated, technologicallyunjustified, or duplicative. In the authors's view, the concerned governmentagencies should work with the American nuclear industry to bring applicableregulations up-to-date and to streamline procedures without sacrificingbasic non-proliferation objectives. By improving the reliability of Americansuppliers, such an effort could assist this country in realizing itsnon-proliferation objectives. At the same time, the competitiveness ofthe American nuclear industry could be substantially improved.</TEXT></DOC>
