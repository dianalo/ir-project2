STEICHEN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A major NATO dispute over short-rangenuclear weapons reflects a growing West German disenchantment witha defense strategy that would destroy this front-line nation if warbroke out in Europe.   The issue probably will be resolved with a compromise on what todo about the short-range missiles on West German territory. ButWashington cannot afford to ignore the stirrings of its strongestmilitary partner.   ``The days are over when you can sell a defense policy toGermans that clearly threatens to turn their country into a smokingpile of ruins,'' said Peter Danylow, a domestic and foreign policyexpert with the Bonn-based Foreign Affairs Institute.   There is growing public impatience with NATO demands on WestGermany, which has 400,000 foreign troops on its soil as well asconventional hardware and the bulk of the Western alliance'sshort-range missiles.   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, aware of the public mood and worriedabout his political survival, called on Washington and Moscow tonegotiate the reduction of short-range stockpiles.   U.S. and NATO strategists oppose a new round of negotiations onthose missiles until the Warsaw Pact has reduced its advantage inconventional armaments. Bonn has balked on that point, causing riftin the alliance.   Those charting public opinion say the majority of West Germanssupport the government.   ``The West German public has realized as never before that theseweapons would spell the certain destruction of their nation if theywere ever used,'' said Heinz Timmermann, a defense and foreignpolicy expert at the Cologne-based Institute for Eastern andInternational Studies.   ``In an era of warming relations with the Soviet bloc, many WestGermans cannot understand why this strategy should continue,''Timmermann told The Associated Press.   Most of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's shor-rangenuclear arsenal is deployed in West Germany _ 76 Lance missileswith a range of about 75 miles. Should war break out and Soviet-ledforces invade West Germany, those nuclear weapons would be usedalmost exclusively on West and East German soil.   They are part of what NATO officials say is a vital flexibleresponse strategy that combines conventional forces with the threatof using battlefield nuclear weapons.   But West Germans increasingly view the policy as obsolete,especially with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev offering friendshipto Western Europe. Bonn now says it believes the Warsaw Pactmilitary threat has diminished because of the reform and detentepolicies of Gorbachev.   Kohl's government has also said it wants to delay a decision onthe deployment of new missiles to replace the aging Lance systemsuntil at least 1991 _ after the 1990 election.   The new rockets would have a significantly longer range, up to300 miles, and West Germans to a degree share the Kremlin view thattheir deployment would constitute a rearmament step.   Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher have stood firmon the demand for prompt talks, insisting Soviet overtures be metwith a Western readiness to compromise.   Genscher, the architect of the current arms reduction effort,has won widespread public support for his contention that Gorbachev``should be taken at his word.''   The foreign minister, who was born in what is now Communist EastGermany, has argued consistently over his 20-year Cabinet careerthat it is as much in the West's interest as in the East's topursue all opportunities to improve ties between Europe's politicalblocs.   Still, President Bush said last week he opposes earlyshort-range talks. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain hastaken the American side in the dispute   Sen. William S. Cohen, a Maine Republican, said in Washingtonlast week the United States should reconsider its policy of keepinga large military force in West Germany.   ``I think if the West German people have come to the conclusionthey can place more faith and reliance on Gorbachev's words andassurances than they can upon sound NATO strategy, then it would bevery difficult for me to continue to commit the size of the forceswe have under those circumstances.''   While Kohl has said he is optimistic a compromise can be foundbefore a NATO summit in Brussels May 29-30, he has also made itclear that he wants West Germany's ``special situation andinterests'' acknowledged in an overall NATO policy statement.   ``The West German people want to see real progress indisarmament negotiations on issues that directly affect the fateand future of this country,'' said Renate Koecher, a researcher atthe national Polling Institute in Allensbach.   But pollsters and researchers say the overwhelming desire forprogress in East-West weapons talks has not seriously shaken thenation's commitment to NATO.   ``Most West Germans don't want their country to bolt fromNATO,'' said Koecher. ``But there is a strong sentiment in thecountry that NATO should be able to adjust to the changes that haveoccurred in recent years in East-West relations.''   Many see NATO's reluctance on the short-range missile issue aspart of a broader unwillingness to gradually shift to politicalsolutions to East-West issues.   Willfried Penner, a defense expert for the opposition SocialDemocratic Party, said U.S. and British intransigence on theshort-range missiles ``makes NATO look increasingly like a militaryfossil.''   Some analysts predict the conflict is only the first salvo inwhat promises to be a long and difficult debate over West Germany'splace in the alliance and its role in Europe.</TEXT></DOC>
