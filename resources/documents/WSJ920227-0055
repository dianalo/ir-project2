Federal, state and city tax collectors -- with claimsagainst Drexel totaling more than $350 million -- argued incourt papers that the plan unlawfully denies them the rightto sue Drexel's officers and directors after thereorganization for any unpaid tax bills. The reorganizationplan was filed in December.</LP><TEXT>   In addition, the IRS, which is slated to receive $183million on the confirmation date of the bankruptcy plan and$107 million in the course of six years, called the plan &quot;notfeasible&quot; because it &quot;does not show a realistic basis thatall the installment payments&quot; will be made.   Drexel said through a spokesman: &quot;We are attempting toaddress the objections . . . and we believe those issues willbe resolved either by agreement or by the court in sufficienttime so that the plan can be confirmed.&quot;   Individuals familiar with negotiations over the plan saidthat a settlement has been reached with the IRS and thattalks are progressing well with New York City taxauthorities. Less progress is said to have been made inconversations with New York state tax officials. The cityfiled its objection on a $201 million claim, while the statesays it is owed $48 million.   Details of the proposed settlements with the tax agenciesweren't available yesterday. A spokewoman for the governmentattorney representing the IRS said she couldn't comment onthe settlement talks. Attorneys for the city and the statedidn't return phone calls seeking comment.   U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Francis G. Conrad is scheduled toconsider approving the reorganization of the formerinvestment banking powerhouse at a two-day hearing March 5and 6. If the plan is approved, creditors are expected to getfrom 50 cents to 75 cents of every dollar owed, and a spinoffinvestment firm called New Street will be formed, chiefly tomanage Drexel's assets.   In addition to the judge's approval, the plan requiresendorsement of 50% of the creditors in each class,representing at least two-thirds of the dollar value of totalclaims in each class. Voting ends today.   Most of the objections to the plan have been filed byformer employees of Drexel, who argue that the plan doesn'ttreat them fairly. It will be up to Judge Conrad to weightheir complaints, but individuals close to the bankruptcynegotiations said that it's unlikely after two years ofplanning that he'll make substantial changes.   Other creditors filing objections include Citicorp'sCitibank, First Chicago Corp.'s First National Bank ofChicago, Chemical Banking Corp. and the National Bank ofYugoslavia. Lawyers said some objections were filed as acautionary measure to protect future interests, while otherschallenge the ban on future lawsuits against former Drexelofficials.   Judge Conrad rejected earlier arguments against thelawsuit ban by the National Bank of Yugoslavia, brought onseparate grounds from those of the tax agencies. The bank isappealing the matter to U.S District Judge Milton Pollack. Ifthe injunction is lifted, the reorganization plan could fallapart, but Judge Pollack has played an active role incrafting a settlement of Drexel-related suits and is unlikelyto brook any changes that might undo it.   One potential creditor not objecting so far is MichaelMilken, the imprisoned former Drexel junk-bond chief. Mr.Milken has filed claims worth hundreds of millions of dollarsbut has been given extra time to object. He's likely toobject only if a proposed $1.3 billion settlement of civilsuits against him and others by Drexel, investors and thriftregulators falls through. But individuals close to thosesettlement talks said they are proceeding on course.   The details of the proposed Milken settlement, which stillmust be approved by Judge Pollack, are expected to be madepublic at a news conference today.   ---   GAMBINO FAMILY settles organized crime case with New Yorkstate.   In a surprise development, Thomas and Joseph Gambino,heads of the reputed organized-crime family that controlstrucking in Manhattan's garment industry, pleaded guilty toone felony charge each -- restraint of trade and competition.   The agreement abruptly ended a three-week trial in NewYork state court in Manhattan, but its terms resembled morethe amicable settlement of a civil suit than a plea bargainin a criminal case. Under the terms, both Gambinos and twoco-defendants must submit four of their trucking companies tosupervision by a court-appointed special master, sell thecompanies within a year and contribute to a $12 million fundto compensate victims and repay the government for expensesin investigating and prosecuting the case.   But none of the defendants faces either prison orprobation under the agreement, and the Gambino family willretain control of its biggest trucking company, DynamicDelivery Corp. New York District Attorney Robert M.Morgenthau praised the agreement as an unprecedented andinnovative conclusion to one of the city's biggestorganized-crime cases. But defense lawyers for the Gambinossaid the only unprecedented aspects of the settlement wereits favorable terms to the defendants.   The Gambinos faced a 48-count indictment charging them,two of their employees and four of their trucking companieswith enterprise corruption, larceny, coercion and extortion.Each of the brothers could have been sentenced to 25 years inprison if convicted. Instead, said Mike Rosen, defenseattorney for Thomas Gambino, &quot;the defendants are walking outthe front door.&quot;   The case involved the Gambino family's monopoly oftrucking within Manhatten's garment district and the deliveryof &quot;cut work,&quot; or precut garment components, to sewing shopsin New York's Chinatown. The garment district is the nation'slargest apparel-manufacturing center, headquarters for up toa quarter of the nation's estimated 12,000 clothing makers.   Prosecutors alleged that Gambino monopoly practicesallowed trucks to charge up to 70% more than they wouldcharge if they had competitors. The net effect, prosecutorssaid, was a 7.5% &quot;mob tax&quot; on the final price of mostclothing made in the garment district. The Gambino familymaintained its control with threats of violence and illegaleconomic pressure, according to prosecutors, though noevidence of actual violence was submitted in trial.   Michael Cherkasky, the district attorney's leadinvestigator in the case, said the agreement will shut downthe Gambino family's most profitable operation, and the onlyone in which prosecutors have been able to prove illegaltrade practices.   But defense lawyers said the favorable terms of theagreement amount to a government concession that its criminalcase was falling apart. The agreement permits the Gambinofamily to continue picking up garments from sewing shops anddelivering them to shipping and distribution points outsidethe garment district. Mr. Morgenthau also agreed not to seekany civil forfeitures in the case or file state antitrustcharges.   ---   SUITS AGAINST DIRECTORS and officers grew costlier in1991.   Although the number of lawsuits against corporateofficials began to level off last year after several years ofincreases, payouts per claim were up. Insurance payments onclaims of more than $3.25 million increased significantlyfrom the year before, according to a consulting firm's annualsurvey of 1,501 companies.   About 4% of such so-called Dandamp;O claims resulted in paymentsto plaintiffs of more than $20 million, compared with 1% in1990. &quot;It goes up a little every year,&quot; said Phillip N.Norton, a risk management consultant at Wyatt Co., Chicago.   The survey also found that officials of companies involvedin mergers, acquisitions, takeovers or divestitures were morethan three times as likely as others to be sued. Theallegation by employees that they were wrongfully fired wasthe most frequent issue raised in suits.   Of the dozen industry groups surveyed, large banks andsavings and loan associations reported the most claims. Suchinstitutions also paid the highest Dandamp;O insurance premiums,with a median of $366,000. Utilities paid the second-highestpremiums, with a $351,000 median. The median for all surveyparticipants was $191,000.   Savings and loan executives will be hit by even morelawsuits this year as the Resolution Trust Corp. gears up itslegal efforts against them, said Stephen Sills, chiefunderwriting officer for Aetna/Executive Risk ManagementAssociates.   The report projects no significant changes for mostcorporations in 1992. &quot;The market is very hard tocharacterize,&quot; Mr. Norton said, noting that large financialinstitutions saw double-digit premium increases last yearwhile most industries had 5% to 8% increases.</TEXT></DOC>
