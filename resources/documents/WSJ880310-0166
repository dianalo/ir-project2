The accord, subject to the approval of the two companies' boards, appears to give the unit of the Kuwaiti government investment arm effective management control of Explosivos Rio Tinto. Sources said Cros would obtain 50% representation on the 20-member board by June and would have veto power over board decisions.    If confirmed, the pact is expected to end months of hostilities between Explosivos Rio Tinto and the KIO, which through Cros is the chemicals company's biggest shareholder with a 24.9% stake.    The proposal provides for the two companies to go ahead with plans to merge their fertilizer operations into a jointly owned company. Explosivos Rio Tinto's main defense operations would be transferred to a separate company in which it would have a minority holding. </TEXT></DOC>
