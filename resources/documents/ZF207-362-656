  That coveragewill include new developments in electronic retrieval and delivery, databasepublishing, commercial composition and prepress color production.andP;  Here, wewill focus on those new products that have sufficiently broad distribution tobe considered under the desktop moniker.andM;Composition.andP;  In the composition area, Frame announced FrameMaker 2.0, itsfirst release to incorporate commercial composition features.andP;  Quark showedXpress 2.1, with greatly improved typographic controls.andP;  Interestingly, twocompanies demonstrated composition engines available to be incorporated intoother vendors' products.andP;  These engines, from Stonehand and DeucalionResources Group, will be covered in the Publishing Systems report.andM;Mac dominates image processing.andP;  There were a raft of image processingannouncements, many of them for processing color images on the Macintosh.andO;Barneyscan formally introduced Barneyscan XP, the retouching software it isbundling with the Macintosh scanning software that drives its scanner.andO;Letraset showed an early version of ColorStudio.andP;  Other developments includednew scanners from Microtek, new scanning software from Pre-Press Technologiesand Truvel, OCR products from Xerox and Color Extension for PageMaker.andP;  Wealso took a closer look at several recently released products: Adobe'sStreamline and Silicon Beach's SuperCard.andM;CompositionandM;Frame adds 100 new featuresandM;Frame Technology unveiled a software release that achieves nearlyacross-the-board improvements in functionality: from typography to graphics,from book pagination to math, from spot color to facilities for launchingother applications from within FrameMaker--plus significant additions to theediting facilities.andP;  The release, called 2.0, was demonstrated in preliminary form, running on the Next Computer as well as on its traditionalSun workstations.andP;  The new release is scheduled to be available this fall.andM;All told, there were more than 100 new features, a list so long we had tofocus on getting a quick view of the most significant ones, rather thantaking an in-depth look at any of them.andP;  We'll highlight the main areas here.andM;Typography.andP;  In the area of typography, where FrameMaker has been seriouslydeficient, the program is now quite respectable, exceeding the capabilitiesof most desktop products and rivaling some of the higher-end systems.andP;  Thejustification routine targets the optimum interword space and then worksfirst toward the minimum then towards the maximum, with the option ofautomatic letterspacing if desired.andP;  Four dictionaries are supported forhyphenation: a 130,000-word list supplied by Proximity, a site dictionarycreated by the system administrator, a personal dictionary for the usercurrently logged on, and an exception list created for the current document.andO;The user can look up any word and see how the program would break it.andM;The operator has control over the number of consecutive lines that may behyphenated, the shortest word that may be hyphenated, and the number ofcharacters that must precede or follow a hyphen.andM;In type sizes and leading, FrameMaker exceeds most other systems inflexibility, supporting increments of a thousandth of a point.andP;  The screenshows true fonts and true sizes, scaled on the fly.andP;  Sizes can be changedfreely within lines of type, with the system adjusting leading based on thelargest size on the line.andP;  Taking a feature from the quality compositionsystems, FrameMaker calculates automatic leading by considering the sizes ofascenders and descenders on the adjacent lines.andM;One thing the new release doesn't do, however, is expand and condense type,which will be a significant limitation for some applications.andM;Other new features include automatic kerning, suppression of double spaces,&quot;smart quotes&quot; that convert inch marks into quotation marks, baselinealignment of adjacent columns, and the ability to switch between languages ona paragraph-by-paragraph basis.andP;  FrameMaker supports hyphenation, spellingchecking and fonts for American and UK English, French, German, Dutch,Italian, Swedish, Norwegian, Spanish and both European and BrazilianPortuguese.andM;Interactive page layout.andP;  The program now supports multiple master pages thatcan be applied to any page or set of pages.andP;  Formats can be applied while inthumbnail viewing mode so that the operator can see the results displayed onall pages.andP;  Frames can be named and applied when graphic elements repeat(rules, etc.).andP;  Other new features include scrolling across page boundaries,zooming in and out (chaning the zoom factor from 25% to 1600% on the fly),and automatic numbering.andM;Editing  features.andP;  There is a batch spelling checker that generates a fileof questionable words, which then can be inserted into the dictionary.andP;  Inaddition to checking spelling, the interactive spelling checker can be askedto flag bad capitalization, double punctuation, repeated words and unusualhyphenation.andM;The search/replace routine has been enhanced to enable searching on sets oftypographic characteristics, such as finding a text string in 10-point TimesRoman and changing it to 12-point Helvetica.andP;  It also supports wildcards,whole-word searches, case sensitivity/insensitivity, and searching for tags,cross-references, variables and so on.andM;Book building.andP;  Automatic footnoting supports column-width footnotes, withuse-definable numbering style, spacing, separator and maximum height on apage.andP;  But it won't break a long note and put the rest on the next page.andP;  Afootnote longer than the space available is truncated at the bottom of thepage; succeeding footnotes are moved to the next page.andM;The program generates running headers and footers based on master layouts forleft/right/custom pages, with multiple lines and graphics supported inheaders and footers.andP;  Cross-referencing can be implemented across multipleopen documents.andP;  Version 2.0 generates &quot;system variables&quot; (such as the date adocument was modified or the current date) and embeds them in the document,as might be appropriate in inserting chapter name, subheads, etc.andP;  on a page.andO;User-defined variables include text strings that appear repeatedly in adocument.andM;Revision tracking has been added, but it isn't competitive with the betterproducts on the market.andP;  It generates a change bar anyplace text has beeninserted, deleted or replaced, with the bar extending the height of thechanged area in the text.andP;  The user can control the thickness of the bar andits placement with respect to text.andP;  But there is no means of tracking whomade the changes, aside from keeping a separate version for each editor.andP;  Anice feature is the ability to remove change bars that are generated forinsignificant changes, such as correcting typographical errors.andM;Math.andP;  The math program is perhaps the flashiest of the new features.andO;Developed with the cooperation of a graduate student in physics, it providesa nice user interface, operator control over sizes of symbols andinferior/superior characters for  multilevel math, and the ability to solvethe equations.andM;The user interface supports the mouse as well as the keyboard for performingany operations.andP;  A palette is displayed for selecting Greek characters,atomic symbols, operators, diacritical marks, etc.andP;  Selecting parts of anequation to operate on, such as the expression for the denominator, is easilyaccomplished by adding elements incrementally until the desired ones arehighlighted.andP;  Some parts of equation building are automated, includinggeneration of a second parenthesis to balance a first one.andP;  For creatinginline equations, the system provides a convenient editing area and thenmoves the equation into the text line when it is completed.andM;Perhaps the most remarkable part of FrameMath, as it is called, is theability to manipulate the data and solve equations.andP;  It can solve forunknowns, take one equation and apply it to another, transpose matrixes, andsolve integrals and derivatives.andP;  (We didn't get out our college calculusbook to see if FrameMath got the right results, but they looked good.)andM;Graphics.andP;  FrameMaker already had the ability to draw objects from geometricprimitives or freehand, smooth polygons, group graphic objects and manipulatethem, import graphics in a variety of formats, etc.andP;  It has added the abilityto rotate text and graphics in 90-degree increments, flip them, zoom aportion of a drawing for editing or to fit an area, create and edit Beziercurves, specify spot color, import and display Encapsulated PostScript files,fill objects with patterns, and use a gravity function in line drawing.andP;  Alsoadded are import filters for MacWrite, MS-Word and TIFF.andM;File management.andP;  A user-definable automatic save option also provides theability to revert to the last manual save rather than the automatic one.andO;File locking has been implemented for multiuser situations.andM;Live links to other programs.andP;  Another nice feature is the ability to importdata from other programs and update it &quot;live&quot; by clicking on the item, whichlaunches the program on the screen.andP;  The user has the choice of changing acopy of the data or changing the original.andP;  Other vendors currentlysupporting this function include Autodesk, Caseware, IDE, Informix, Polygen,Qubix, SPSS and Sybase.andM;What's missing?andP;  We've mentioned a few items that aren't included in theFrame release (expanding and condensing type, true revision tracking tohandle multiple editors and the ability to split a footnote), and there are afew more.andP;  CALS hasn't been addressed yet.andP;  As Frame says, it has &quot;laid thegroundwork for CALS compliance in a post-2.0 release.&quot;andM;The tables program is ordinary, supporting ruler-based tabs, decimalalignment and positioning in thousandths of a point.andP;  There also is noprogram for setting ragged text aesthetically, although none of itscompetitors handles this much better.andP;  (Frame calculates each ragged linebased on the user-specified spaceband and breaks it at the convenient point,regardless of how the previous line may have broken.)andP;  And rotation of textand graphics is limited to 90-degree increments.andM;But, in general, Frame has dealt with most of the weaknesses in the existingprogram and produced a package that looks as if it will be very competitivewith documentation systems at all levels.andP;  It isn't out yet, so we obviouslyhave to wait for the final release to be sure all of these items are includedand that they all work as planned and as demonstrated at the Seminars.andM;FrameMaker 2.0 will sell for $2,500, the same price as earlier versions.andM;Quark offers more typographic powerandM;Quark brought the forthcoming version 2.1 of Xpress, which was scheduled tobe shipped immediately after the Seminars.andP;  We like the emphasis that thecompany is now placing on aesthetic typography.andM;Xpress 2.1.andP;  Xpress 2.1 offers greatly enhanced typographic controls.andP;  Itincludes user-customizable automatic kerning and tracking tables; independentcontrols over the minimum, optimum and maximum interword and intercharacterspace; improved control over the quality and frequency of hyphenation(minimum size of hyphenatable word, number of characters that must precedeand follow a hyphen, maximum number of consecutive lines that can behyphenated); optional automatic justification of lines whose ends fall withina definable &quot;flush zone&quot; (which we would call a justification zone);conversion of inch and foot marks into quotation marks; baseline shifting bycommand (for such needs as sub- and superscripts); and the ability to createan invisible &quot;grid&quot; and lock text baselines to it.andP;  Handamp;j parameters can now beapplied to text blocks as small as a paragraph rather than only to the entiretext file.andM;These enhancements represent a strong step forward for Quark toward therequirements of professional typography.andP;  We hope that it will soon implementexpanded and condensed type and hung punctuation, Xpress's greatest remainingtypographic deficiencies.andM;Font rendering.andP;  A new feature that packs a visual wallop--its results wereevident a couple of booths away--is &quot;font rendering.&quot; Xpress can now generateoptimized screen images of fonts, at any size, based on the PostScriptprinter font description.andP;  The user specifies a point size above whichrendering should occur.andP;  This proprietary process did not noticeably slowscreen repainting.andP;  The rendered type was superior anywhere above text size,but in headlines the contrast with the crude existing letterforms was likenight and day (see illustrations).andM;Xpress cannot render encrypted fonts; its rendering function currentlysupports only Type Three fonts from Bitstream, Compugraphic, Casady,MacTographer, The Font Company, ImageClub and others.andM;A few of the other significant improvements in Xpress 2.1 are the ability todisplay halftone screen patterns and to print halftone images to aLaserWriter (using the &quot;Ordered Dither&quot; screen pattern); color and gray-scalebalancing patches for color-separated pages with registration marks; theability to increase or decrease an existing document's page size; and rulersthat can be specified as inches or picas.andM;Island on the SunandM;The editing/composition/layout, drawing and painting software Island Graphicsdeveloped for Sun Microsystems (sold as SunWrite, -Draw and -Paint) wasdemonstrated running within the Open Look environment in the Island booth.andO;We had seen it at UniForum, where we reported that its strength lies partlyin the nice integration of the three packages.andP;  At the Seminars, there wasprobably more talk about market positioning than about features.andP;  This waspartly a result of Frame's blitz through the event with its flashy 2.0software, and the possibility of its going head-to-head with Island'sproducts, which are priced lower and provide some of the same functionality.andM;We don't think that the two products will often compete head-to-head, atleast not yet.andP;  The Island suite is an easy-to-use, comprehensive packagethat should provide appropriate facilities for people getting started andneeding good, general-purpose tools, emphasizing flexible layout andintegration of graphics, but not strong typography.andP;  For applications withstricter technical documentation requirements, FrameMaker will be well worththe extra money.andP;  (It costs $2,500, including word processing and graphicscapabilities, compared to Sun's price of $995 for the SunWrite/Draw/Painttrio.)andM;Within Open Look, the Sun products look a little snazzier than they have intheir other guises (such as in AB Dick's Inprint), with little push pins to&quot;pin&quot; sub-menus to the screen and exploding message windows.andP;  But much of thefunctionality is similar.andP;  SunWrite, the word processing and layout program,focuses on interactive layout of pages, with containers for flowing text.andO;Containers can be linked in any order.andP;  The system even has the ability offlow text around--and jump text over--irregular shapes.andM;Layout is based on two master pages plus exceptions, with user-selectablenumbering schemes, automatic creation of new pages to flow text onto, movingof containers to the front or back, indenting by moving points on a ruler,snapping to grid for alignment, a status window to report the font, size,position, etc., of the character at the cursor, and cut-and-paste for movingelements--nice features for interactive page layout.andM;Typographic style is applied to elements (paragraphs, words or even singlecharacters) through a library of styles that can be changed later to changethe global characteristics of the document.andM;Notably, SunWrite supports layout of multiple articles within a document andgood search/replace and spelling checking routines.andP;  We didn't try to do anyediting within the program, but Island says its editor is good enough to bethe primary editor used in document creation, although it also imports ASCIItext.andM;Typographic controls aren't as strong as layout functions.andP;  Word spacing isspecified as a single value (a percentage of the value for the font), as ischaracter spacing, and the system lacks good controls over how hyphenation isachieved, aside from the existence of a large dictionary.andM;SunWrite can import graphics in EPS and Sun raster formats, as well as thosefrom SunDraw and SunPaint.andM;SunPaint is a one-bit-deep raster graphics program with brushes, a lassofeature, and the ability to invert, flip, rotate, copy and move elements, aswell as make them transparent.andP;  Text functions are currently limited to8-point system fonts, but they will be enhanced later.andM;SunDraw supports the same fonts as SunWrite, sized to 72 points, withadditional scaling beyond 72.andP;  Drawing functions include creating lines froma variety of geometric primitives, filling polygons with patterns, rotation,locking angles to a fixed size, smoothing lines, grouping elements, aligningitems, and so on--a good set of features.andP;  A coordinate readout tells thecurrent location.andP;  The screen can be zoomed from 10% to 500%.andP;  Drawings canbe anchored to a page.andM;Image ProcessingandM;Aldus introduces Color ExtensionandM;Aldus is by far the leading vendor of desktop publishing software, butPageMaker has lagged behind its Macintosh competitors Xpress and ReadySetGoin one crucial area: color.andP;  Last year, PageMaker added support for spotcolors in Version 3.0.andP;  What it lacked was a means to handle color images.andO;Quark and Letraset made the most of their temporary advantages in 1988 bynegotiating agreements with Scitex and Crosfield for passing files over tothe prepress system.andP;  Not to be outdone, Aldus announced at the Seminar itsremedies: Color Extension for Mac PageMaker 3.0 and OPI.andM;Color Extension is aptly named, because what it adds are a few extensions tothe spot color support included with 3.0.andP;  The extensions are in the form ofmore color models from which to select colors (notably Pantone's colors), anew flat tint separation capability, the ability to display color TIFF imagesand the ability to output color pages in Encapsulated PostScript format.andP;  Autility for separating color pages is being cooperatively marketed withPre-Press Technologies, which developed the tint and four-color separationsoftware.andM;Color models.andP;  Color Extension offers four models for color selection.andP;  Thefirst three--RGB, CYMK and HLS (hue, lightness and saturation)--were alreadyin 3.0.andP;  New is support for the Pantone Matching System, including both flatand process Pantone colors.andM;The use of Pantone's colors is quite useful for specifying color from amonochrome Macintosh.andP;  Even though the color will not show on the screen, ifyou have a color PostScript printer that Color Extension supports (TektronixPhaser or QMS ColorScript), you can get a proof that shows a reasonablefacsimile of the colors that the printer will actually use on the press.andM;When working on a color screen, the PMS colors do not match the colors of theprinter any more precisely than those of the other models, but they stilloffer a standard reference point (the color swatches) that is often quiteuseful.andM;Flat tint separations.andP;  A second new capability is separation of flat tintsas well as spot color in text.andP;  Aldus has integrated a subset of Pre-PressTechnologies' SpectreTint package, so that any object may be given adesignated color that may be output separately.andP;  Unfortunately, Aldus hasfollowed the path of least resistance taken by most Mac vendors and notimplemented chokes and spreads, which are necessary to produce qualityseparations for use by the printer.andP;  We will watch with interest theacceptance of this level of separation, because we believe it is only amatter of time until users discover the limitations of this level ofseparation and demand such capability be added.andP;  The flat-tint separationutlity, called CE Separator, is bundled with every Color Extension package.andM;Display of color TIFF.andP;  Color image processing software arrived on the marketlast year, and Aldus' 24-bit color TIFF format is one of two formatsconsidered a de facto standard for displaying such files.andP;  (The other isEncapsulated PostScript.)andP;  PageMaker for the Mac--with Color Extension--isable to display color TIFF files on either 8- or 24-bit monitors.andM;The user has the same tools for manipulating color images as for monochrome:cropping, scaling and placing images are done interactively on the screenusing the mouse as the control.andM;Separating color images.andP;  Consistent with the competition, Color Extensiondoes not include tools for producing four-color separations ofcontinuous-tone images.andP;  But rather than sign an agreement with one or moreprepress vendors (a la Quark and Letraset), Aldus chose a more broad-basedapproach.andP;  First, it asked Pre-Press Technologies to develop a subset of itsSpectrePrint color separation software that would be specific to PageMaker.andO;This product, SpectreSeps/PM, is offered to every Color Extension customer asan add-on that is purchased directly from Pre-Press Technologies.andM;SpectreSeps/PM is about as simple a color separation program as you'll get,with virtually no controls or operator intervention required.andP;  It producescolor separations for people just starting to learn about color--the marketthat wants to move into color but is not ready for manual color correction.andO;Aldus estimates that as much as 50% of its Mac PageMaker customers base wantsto move into color separations, and this product will enable them to do thatwith a minimum of expense and effort.andM;The quality of such separations may vary considerably.andP;  Unlike theSpectrePrint product, SpectreSeps/PM uses the same default values for allseparations.andP;  There is no way to override those defaults if you don't likethe separations it produces, except to go out and purchase the fullSpectrePrint software for $5,000.andP;  As with flat tint separations, it will beinteresting to see whether Aldus will be pressured to improve the quality ofSpectreSeps/PM once thousands of users begin making their own separations.andM;OPI.andP;  But SpectreSeps/PM is only half the story.andP;  The other half--for thosewho want to lay out pages in PageMaker but still want a color trade shop tomake the separations--was Aldus' proposal that other vendors adopt itsapproach to incorporating image placement and manipulation information as aheader in an Encapsulated PostScript file.andP;  This format, which Aldus callsthe Open Prepress Interface (OPI), has been endorsed by three prepressvendors--Crosfield, Dainippon Screen and Diadem--although none has stated howand when it intends to incorporate such support into its own systems.andP;  It wasalso endorsed by Adobe and numerous Macintosh software developers (see page10 for a discussion of OPI).andM;Aldus is betting that by establishing a de facto standard for interchange ofcolor images, it will eclipse Xpress and Ready-SetGo as the prefered pagecomposition program for interchange with prepress systems--or that Quark andLetraset will join in supporting the OPI standard.andM;Look for Color Extension toward the end of the second quarter, at a retailprice of $195.andP;  SpectreSeps/PM should be available in the same time frame for$395.andM;Furtures.andP;  Aldus gave the Seminar attendees a glimpse of what to expect inthe future in an interesting demonstration of color editing software runningon a Mac II.andP;  Aldus showed the same image displayed on two monitors--one8-bit, the other 24-bit--displayed side-by-side in its booth.andP;  The differencein detail was dramatic enough to believe that 24-bit monitors may beessential for color retouching.andP;  Aldus is aware that several companies, mostnotably Avalon, Letraset and Barneyscan, are already selling such software,but the company was clearly hinting that image processing is an applicationit might offer in the near future.andM;Letraset's ColorStudioandM;ColorStudio extends the retouching and image-manipulation functionality ofLetraset's monochrome image-manipulation package, ImageStudio, into the colorrealm (see Vol.andP;  2, No.andP;  1).andM;ColorStudio takes advantage of the new Macintosh 32-bit color technology.andO;(In fact, the product will not be shipped until Apple officially releases32-bit QuickDraw, which should occur very soon.)andP;  In the 32-bit environment,ColorStudio uses 8 bits each for red, green, and blue; the remaining 8 bitsper pixel are used for masking data.andP;  Therefore, masks need not be opaque:they can have 256 levels of transparency.andP;  That permits effects such as oneimage &quot;showing through&quot; another.andM;Masking is one of the fundamental tasks in ColorStudio.andP;  The mask defines theregion of an image on which an operation will be performed.andP;  When placing animage on top of another one, a mask must be created which defines the imagearea being placed.andP;  Masks can be created freehand (at a high magnification)or automatically by color.andP;  (This only works when the area you want to maskis significantly different in color from its background.)andM;ColorStudio has lots of tools for adjusting the color of an image, and thereare retouching and painting tools for local changes.andP;  Many of the toolsavailable in ImageStudio have been extended.andP;  For example, the &quot;water drop&quot;blending tool has been enhanced to provide local sharpening as well asblurring.andP;  The approach to image cloning has been made easier to control.andP;  An&quot;airbrush&quot; tool with a wide variety of parameters has been added.andP;  Multipleimage files can be open simultaneously, which isn't possible in ImageStudio.andM;Color requires lots of data.andP;  Letraset recommends a minimum configuration forColorStudio of a Macintosh II with 4 MB of RAM and a 40-MB disk.andP;  But weexpect you'll want several times that disk space if you intend to use thisproduct seriously.andP;  If you don't have your own color output capability,you'll need to transport your data to the output site.andP;  ColorStudio supports9-track tape drives for image storage and transfer; for the rest of us, theproduct also supports output of an image to several floppies.andM;Initially, only color PostScript printers will be supported as outputs.andP;  Butinterfaces to high-end color systems should follow.andM;ColorStudio is to be released in the first half of 1989, depending on Apple'scolor QuickDraw announcement.andP;  No pricing has been set.andP;  The company willonly say the price will be &quot;under $5,000.&quot;andM;Microtek: Sun scanners, new colorandM;Along with the first complete retail scanning packages for use with Sunworkstations, Microtek brought a last-minute surprise: the MSF-300Z 24-bitcolor scanner.andP;  This model, expected to be released at Macworld Expo andshipped in late summer, will first be configured for use with Macintoshes,then for PCs, then for Sun workstations.andM;Like the other models to be mentioned here, the MSF-300Z can scan up to 81/2&quot; x 14&quot; originals.andP;  It makes three passes (one for each color); it canalso make a single pass to read 8 bits of gray-scale data.andP;  Its list price,described for now only as &quot;below $4,000,&quot; will include a color image editingprogram--probably something like Letraset's ColorStudio or Avalon's PhotoMac.andM;The ScanVu-300 (300-dpi) and ScanVu-400 (400-dpi) desktop flatbed scannerssupport Sun-3 workstations; by the end of May, they will also work with Sun-4and Sun-386i models.andP;  By that point, they will also support Unix V4.0; theycurrently operate under V3.5.andP;  Both scanners recognize 256 gray levels.andP;  The300-dpi unit costs $4,000; the 400-dpi one, $5,000.andM;Microtek is selling for $1,750 a ScanVu Interface Kit that brings Sunfunctionality to the MSF-400G or GS and the MSF-300G, GS, Q, QS, A or C.andP;  Thekit must be installed by Microtek.andM;A final newcomer in the Microtek booth was a low-end ($1,495),small-footprint, sheet-fed, 300-dpi scanner intended for OCR work, the MS-II.andO;It comes with a 50-sheet automatic document feeder.andP;  Scanning insingle-bit-per-pixel mode, it can use dithering to produce 64 shades of gray.andM;At a press conference, Astral Development announced that its PicturePublisher monochrome image editing program would henceforth be bundled withall Microtek gray-scale scanners for use with IBM-compatible PCs.andP;  Microtekrecently began bundling Silicon Beach's Digital Darkroom and Super-Paint withits gray-scale scanners for the Macintosh.andM;Pre-Press TechnologiesandM;Pre-Press has been at the forefront of desktop color separations since theintroduction of SpectrePrint (color separations) and SpectreMatch (colorcorection) last year.andP;  Even though it is relying on the halftoning of thePostScript RIP, Pre-Press has done its best to optimize the quality byoffering the user as much control as possible.andP;  At last year's Seminar, wenoted that these controls were done blind (Vol.andP;  17, No.andP;  15 of the SeyboldReport on Publishing Systems).andP;  Throughout the year, we traced its progressas it added on-screen feedback, ported its software to the Mac, and developednew releases of its software.andP;  This year, Pre-Press announced newcapabilities at the low and high ends of its product.andP;  With these releases,it has become the current leader in a market just starting to accelerate.andM;SpectreSeps/PM.andP;  In conjunction with the introduction of Color Extension forMac PageMaker, Pre-Press announced a PageMaker-specific version of itsSpectrePrint color separation software.andP;  Aldus will be including an ordercard for SpectreSeps/PM with every shipment of Color Extension, anarrangement that could dramatically boost Pre-Press's sales.andM;Unlike the color separation software that Pre-Press sells, SpectreSeps/PMoffers no color correction or visual feedback and few controls over theseparation process.andP;  The idea is to offer the customer the simplest colorseparations possible, which means using default values for all jobs.andO;Variables include type of press, stock and adjusting highlights and shadows.andM;For those who are unhappy with the results obtained this way, Pre-Pressoffers two solutions.andP;  First, you can take your SpectreSeps/PM file to anauthorized Pre-Press service bureau (of which there are currently a halfdozen in the U.S.), and the service bureau will read your file intoSpectreMatch Print, show you an on-screen proof, which may be colorcorrected, and generate new separations that will hopefully be more to yourliking.andP;  Those who would prefer to take control of the process themselves arewelcome to upgrade to the Pre-Press flagship products.andM;No samples of SpectreSeps/PM were available at the Seminars.andP;  The sample weran in our January issue was done with SpectrePrint, not the PageMakerversion.andM;SpectreScan.andP;  Pre-Press has added a software module for driving the Eikonixdesktop color slide scanner that the company hopes to use for other scannersin the future.andM;The most noticeable difference in SpectreScan when compared with otherscanning programs is that it incoporates color correction on the fly as theimage is scanned.andP;  Like other programs, SpectreScan enables you to scan animage and make color corrections based on what you see on the screen.andP;  But inother programs, those color corrections are made to the original image data.andO;In SpectreScan, you can save all of you corrected values and then rescan.andO;Scanning controls such as exposure time and focus, in addition to adjustmentsto color values, are taken into account as the new scan is made.andP;  Theresulting color-corrected file is produced much more quickly, and in somecases it contains more detail than you could get by color correcting aninferior scan.andM;Several interesting features of SpectreScan are its bias and gain control,which is used to calibrate the scanner; an on-screen digital oscilloscope,which shows the actual RGB values as the scan is made; an on-linedensitometer; and the ability to vary the level of subsample for the screendisplay, from 1:1 to 8:1.andP;  In addition, any color modifications may be madeto selective filters of the scan (for example, to blue only), rather than tothe entire image.andP;  The program saves files in several formats (Targa, TIFF,EPS) and provides cropping and scaling tools similar to other scanningprograms.andM;SpectreScan is scheduled to be available from Pre-Press for both Mac and PCin 60 days.andP;  The company is an authorized VAR for Eikonix, and the price forSpectreScan as an Eikonix driver is $7,500.andP;  A version is also beingdeveloped for Sharp scanners.andM;SpectreMatchPrint II.andP;  Pre-Press is developing an advanced version of itsbundled color correction and separation software running under MS-DOS.andO;SpectreMatchPrint II is a superset of SpectrePrint and SpectreMatch, withseveral special features we have yet to see in any other desktop colorprogram.andM;Color correction has been enhanced with the addition of a software zoom,which goes back to disk to retrieve more data.andP;  The hardware zoom provided bythe Vista board is still present.andM;Color correction may now be applied inside as well as outside of a mask.andM;In separations, SpectreMatchPrint II offers a &quot;neutral window,&quot; which is usedto specify more pecisely where and to what degree black will be appliedduring the RGB-to-CYMK conversion process (see photo).andM;Pre-Press plans to offer SpectreMatchPrint II as a turnkey system, but it isstill evaluating the exact configuration it will offer.andP;  We think it is safeto say it will be at least an  80386-based PC running at 25 MHz or faster,with plenty of memory, disk storage, color monitor, slide scanner and maybeeven a Mac for page composition.andP;  Details should be forthcoming this summer.andM;A step ahead.andP;  For global color correction, Pre-Press is still a step aheadof the pack nipping at its heels.andP;  Barney, Letraset and Avalon are alllearning the color image software business, and Aldus and others will soonthrow their hats into the ring, too.andP;  It will be a highly competitive market.andO;We wouldn't be surprised to see Pre-Press negotiate OEM arrangements withother graphic arts suppliers that are anxious to get into the colorseparation market as a means of establishing its presence for good.andM;Truvel: Color TruScanning on IBMandM;Historically a Macintosh supporter, Truvel introduced the color version ofits TruScan scanning software to run on an IBM-compatible PC under MicrosoftWindows.andP;  It was using this software to perform 24-bit color scans using theTZ-3BWC, a combination black-and-white and color scanner.andP;  The user canperform a prescan, define the area to be scanned and control the aspectratio.andP;  TruScan supports images as large as 12&quot; x 17&quot;, at resolutions from 75to 900 dpi, and saves them in TIFF, Targa or PCX format.andP;  A VGA display cardand an external RGB analog monitor are needed to display gray-scale or colorimages.andM;Truvel was also demonstrating the T-35BWC 35mm slide scanner, which it hadfirst shown at Macworld Expo in January (see Vol.andP;  3, No.andP;  6, p. 8).andM;The Zebra image processing board ($995), which mounts in the TZ-3 or TZ-3BWCscanner, was improving scanned line-art images.andP;  Scanners usually process anentire line-art-original using a fixed threshold setting, a measure ofdensity that determines whether each pixel is recognized as black or white.andO;The Zebra board adjusts this setting dynamically in response to changes in aregion's relative lightness or darkness.andP;   In a predominantly white area,Zebra would alter the setting so that more pixels would be recorded as black,and vice versa.andP;  These adjustments fill in perceived midtone subtleties thattypical line-art scans would miss.andP;  Because Zebra handles processing on thefly, the scanning process is not slowed.andM;Xerox Imaging Systems: Dueling OCRandM;Not surprisingly, Xerox Imaging Systems (Datacopy and Kurzweil) was focusingon optical character recognition.andP;  Kurzweil showed the K5000 &quot;intelligentscanning system,&quot; while Datacopy was represented by the new AccuTextsoftware.andM;Kurzweil 5000.andP;  The K5000, which succeeds the K4000 atop the Kurzweil productline, combines a 400-dpi scanner with a PC-compatible coprocessor card andrecognition software.andP;  The scanner handles pages up to 8-1/2&quot; x 14&quot;, scans256 gray levels and comes with a 50-sheet document feeder.andM;Kurzweil claims that the K5000 accurately reads text from 6 to 24 points,including bold, italic and underscored characters.andP;  In our tests (using atabloid newspaper page), it did quite well on body text but had trouble withsmall headlines (possibly because the type was too heavy) and with italiccharacters.andP;  In some cases, entire paragraphs were recognized correctlyexcept for italicized words.andP;  The software is also supposed to separatecolumns automatically; it handled most of them properly but sometimes putsubhead text into the wrong column.andM;The K5000 has dictionaries against which it checks identified words.andP;  TheEnglish-language dictionary has 40,000 entries, to which the user can add10,000 more; the standard package also includes dictionaries for Dutch,French, German, Italian, Norwegian, Spanish and Swedish.andM;Using the document feeder, the K5000 can read through a stack of pages, readthrough them again after they have been turned over, and then properly orderthe resulting text file.andP;  It offers automatic formatting in DCA, UDF orInterleaf (optional) format and can save graphics in PCX, TIFF, IGF(Interleaf) or RES (Xerox) format.andP;  The system sells for $15,000.andM;AccuText.andP;  A beta version of Datacopy's AccuText program, slated for an April15 release at a price of $995, didn't perform quite as well as the K5000 butwas still quite respectable.andP;  The program runs on a Macintosh II (or SE witha 68020 accelerator card) with at least 4 MB of RAM.andP;  It can use Datacopyscanners as well as the Hewlett-Packard ScanJet, the Apple Scanner or theMicrotek MS-300A.andM;Our first AccuText run turned out poorly, probably because the document hadbeen skewed more than the allowable 5% (the same figure as for the K5000).andP;  Asucceeding attempt gave far better results.andM;After a prescan has been performed, AccuText enables the user to define textareas (by creating boxes around them), then link them in any order.andP;  Aninteractive display shows the dimensions of the area currently beingselected.andP;  Graphics and text can be scanned together, but graphics are savedin a separate file and hence cannot be linked to text.andP;  The operator usedsome of the five display magnification levels to ensure that thetext-defining boxes encompassed all the desired areas and no extraneousmaterial.andM;AccuText has a 50,000-word built-in &quot;lexicon&quot; and a 10,000-worduser-definable one.andP;  A graphic display, which is optional and slows theprocess slightly, shows a thumbnail sketch of the page, with the amountprocessed represented in reverse video.andP;  Text (scannable from 8 to 24 points)can be saved in Microsoft Word, MacWrite, ASCII and Excel formats; graphics,in TIFF, PICT and MacPaint formats.andM;Like the Kurzweil K5000, AccuText had trouble with small headline text andwith italicized words.andP;  It also had occasional problems with spaces--deletingthem, adding them or putting them in the wrong place.andP;  Apart from those items(and ligatures), it seemed to be about 98-99% accurate.andM;Other TechnologiesandM;Adobe: Streamline revisitedandM;As an update to our announcement of Adobe's new products in our January andFebruary issues, we took another look at Streamline, a raster-to-vectorconversion program for transforming scanned line art into Adobe Illustratoror Encapsulated PostScript files.andM;Streamline.andP;  Streamline, the first retail raster-to-vector conversionprogram, looks at first glance to be a few rungs above the automatic tracingfacilities found in Illustrator '88, Gem Artline and Arts andamp; Letters.andP;  Forstarters, Streamline works as a batch process, so you don't have to trace byhand.andP;  The process may be invoked for multiple files in one pass, so you canrun Streamline while away from your Mac (while at lunch, for instance).andO;However, Streamline is not a background task, which means it ties up the Macwhile making its conversion.andM;Images may be TIFF, PICT or MacPaint formats, black-and-white, with no graylevels, meaning all shading or filling must be black.andP;  The specificationscall for the program to save files in Encapsulated PostScript as well asIllustrator format, but this feature was not being demonstrated at theSeminar.andM;Three tracing methods are available:andM;* Outline tracing--finds the edge of the bit map and creates filled areas;andM;* Centerline tracing--locates the center of a line, then prints lines insteadof filled areas; andandM;* Combination tracing--uses both methods to handle both filled and line artdrawings.andM;In addition, you may convert only a selected portion of an image; you havefive levels of &quot;bit-map match tolerance,&quot; as with Illustrator '88; and youmay choose between creating straight lines, curves, or both.andP;  Together, thesecontrols help focus the conversion on the particular job at hand to achieve aresult closer to what you wanted than when using a general-purpose conversionalgorithm.andM;The demonstrations showed Streamline flawlessly tracing prescanned art andsaving it in an Adobe Illustrator folder.andP;   Because the software works as abackground task and Adobe had no scanner to accommodate live jobs, we willwait until we've tested the software to pass judgment on its accuracy, but ithas an intuitive interface and appears to be reasonably quick.andM;We have yet to receive a copy of the program, but we offer a word of cautionbased on Adobe's literature, which claims that &quot;you may never have to tracean image by hand again.&quot;andP;  Artists may certainly save some of the tracing timewith Streamline, but the resulting file will probably not have grouped thevectors in a way that is useful for manipulation.andP;  A map of the U.S., forexample, would have all of the lines that mark state boundaries, but none ofthose lines would be grouped to treat states as separate objects.andP;  In CADapplications, logical grouping of vectors is done as part of the tracingprocess, and the better raster-to-vector programs attempt to consolidatevectors in logical groups, something Streamline does not do.andP;  How long ittakes to clean up the file after it is &quot;streamlined&quot; is something we hope toreport on in the future.andM;Streamline is available now for a suggested retail price of $395.andP;  Theprogram requires a Mac SE or better with at least 1 MB of RAM; 2 MB arerecommended.andP;  Also required is Illustrator or other software that can importEncapsulated PostScript files.andM;The Font Company: Faithful to designandM;The Font Company offers the URW type library as unhinted, downloadablePostScript type for the Macintosh.andP;  It currently has more than 300 families(out of about 1,500) available and claims to be adding roughly 150 eachmonth.andM;Instead of using the PostScript &quot;set line&quot; command as an approximation ofcurves and adding hints, as Adobe does, The Font Company uses the &quot;set cuve&quot;command.andP;  This approach makes a difference at resolutions greater than 300dpi; small but significant design elements such as curved serif ends arepreserved.andP;  The price for this greater faithfulness to the original is diskspace: The Font Company's font files are about 50% larger than thecorresponding Adobe ones.andM;The Font Company also sells its fonts in Encapsulated PostScript form formodification in Adobe Illustrator or Aldus FreeHand.andP;  Each family of fourweights costs $149.95, or $129.95 for the EPS outlines; families of twoweights generally run $129.95, or $99.95 for the EPS.andM;The Font Company, 12629 N. Tatum Blvd., Suite 210, Phoenix, AZ 85032; phone(602) 996-6606andM;Linotype: RIP IIIandM;The Seybold Seminars marked the first showing of Linotype's Concert Seriesfont bundle, the announcement of a faster PostScript RIP, and a number ofenhancements to the Series 2000 composition system.andM;RIP III.andP;  A faster PostScript controller is always welcome news, and Linotypeplayed the announcement of its RIP III to the hilt.andP;  The machine uses afaster 68020 chip and new interpreter code, and it is claimed to triple thespeed of processing certain halftone images.andP;  Average improvements over arange of jobs containing text and line art will be on the order of 30% overthe RIP II.andP;  The RIP III will sell for the same price as the current RIP IIand will be packaged in the same way.andP;  That is, for the L300 and L500imagesetters it will fit into the outboard tower cabinet, and it will beinboard in the L200.andM;The RIP III, also known as the Saturn controller, was developed and built byLinotype itself, in contrast to the previous Redstone and Atlas controllersthat were Adobe board designs.andP;  It uses a 25-MHz 68020 central processor.andP;  Onthe L300 and L500 machines, it has 8 MB of RAM and a 135-MB disk as standardequipment, allowing much greater font bitmap caching.andP;  (It also allows muchgreater font storage, but right now all of Linotype's PostScript fonts wouldfit on a 20-MB disk.)andP;  The L200 model will have 4 MB of RAM and either a40-MB or 80-MB disk, depending on whether it is in the 1200-dpi A version orthe 1700-dpi B model.andM;The largest improvement in speed is due to various optimizations in thegraphics-handling code, particularly for screening halftones.andP;  However, thedifference in the speed of handling text and line art will be modest, sincethose routines were already highly optimized.andM;Upgrades.andP;  For current owners of these imagesetters, Linotype is offering agenerous upgrade option.andP;  The L300/500 controller can be upgraded for $9,950;this includes the new controller and a new 90-day warranty.andP;  Users who have aLinotype service contract on their RIP II will get a $1,000 discount on theupgrade price.andM;Linotype also wants to protect users who bought a RIP just before the RIP IIIannouncement.andP;  If the 90-day warranty on the RIP II has not yet expired,Linotype will grant a $5,000 discount, bringing the upgrade price down to$4,950.andM;The policy for owners of the L200P is similar, but the prices areproportionately lower.andP;  The basic upgrade of the inboard controller is$5,950.andP;  The discount for service contract work is still $1,000, while thein-warranty discount is $3,000andM;PostSaturn.andP;  We wonder whether the Saturn design will have a long lifetime,since Adobe is widely rumored to be working on its own RISC-based successorto the 68020-based Atlas RIP.andP;  But even more than that, we wonder what asuccessor would be called, since there are no rockets bigger than a Saturn.andM;RIPS: Faster and higherandM;RIPS showed several interesting developments at the Seybold Seminars: a new,faster controller, higher resolution on Canon laser printers, and the abilityto download Adobe fonts.andM;* Fonts.andP;  The most significant development for the entire PostScript marketwas a demonstration of downloading and printing encrypted Type One Adobefonts.andP;  Adobe has managed to keep its font format secret for several years inorder to protect its controller business, but that era has now ended.andP;  (Thetrouble with trade secrets is that they cannot be protected by patent orcopyright, since those legal rights require disclosure.andP;  once a trade secretgets out, there is no protection.)andP;  The samples we saw, which were run on a400-dpi engine, looked quite good.andM;* Speed.andP;  RIPS has redesigned its controller board to use a faster processor.andO;The old design (which was no sluggard itself) used the Weitek 8100 chip set;the new board will use the Intel 80960KB chip.andP;  The 80960 is a family of RISCprocessors designed to be used not as general-purpose  microcomputers, but asdedicated embedded controllers.andP;  The KB version includes on-chipfloating-point math support.andP;  The first generation of 80960's is rated at 10Vax MIPS (that is, relative to a Vax 11/780, which runs at 1 MIPS).andP;  Thisshould make the new RIPS board 50% faster than its old design.andP;  Moreover,Intel has promised faster parts in the future.andM;At the same time, RIPS has moved the PostScript interpreter code into ROMs,which means that it will no longer be necessary to load code from your PC'sdisk each time you boot the computer.andP;  It also means that more of thecontroller RAM memory is available for fonts, page description files andpage-image bitmaps.andM;RIPS said that the new controller would be deliverable in May.andM;* Resolution.andP;  RIPS now supports the 400-dpi version of the Canon SX printerand offers resolution-doubling for both 300- and 400-dpi engines.andP;  That is,it can drive a 300-dpi laser printer at either 300 x 300 dpi or, by doublingthe rate at which it switches the printer's laser diode, at 600 x 300 dpi.andP;  A400-dpi engine can be run at 400 x 400 dpi or 800 x 400 dpi.andP;  The only catchis that the controller needs more memory to form the page bitmap at thehigher resolutions: 3 MB of RAM are provided on the basic 300 x 300 board,but that must be increased to 4 MB for 600 x 300 or 400 x 400, and to 6 MBfor 800 x 400 operation.andM;We expect that 400-dpi printers will become much more common in the nearfuture, and that the falling prices of memory and processing power will maketheir controllers quite affordable.andP;  The improvement in quality isnoticeable.andM;Silicon Beach: SuperCard updateandM;SuperCard is an enhanced version of HyperCard.andP;  HyperCard, the hypertexdatabase software bundled free with every Macintosh, has attracted a widernage of users and developers.andP;  HyperCard uses the metaphor of filing cards:each record is a &quot;card,&quot; and a group of them is a &quot;stack.&quot;andP;  These cards canbe customized, linked and managed in myriad ways, and many features areimplemented so that customization can be done without any programming.andP;  Forthe ambitious, there is a powerful, easily acessed &quot;scripting&quot; (programming)language.andP;  HyperCard has a lot of exciting features, but it has a number oflimitations which are problems for specific applications.andM;SuperCard is a superset of HyperCard that which addresses some of theselimitations.andP;  Here are a few examples:andM;* HyperCard &quot;buttons&quot; (active areas of the screen that can run &quot;scripts&quot; orlink to another card) can only be rectangles.andP;  In SuperCard, anything on thescreen, including irregularly shaped objects, can be a button.andM;* HyperCard doesn't handle object-oriented (&quot;draw-type&quot;) graphics.andP;  (Ithandles scanned or painted bit-maps.)andP;  SuperCard handles both object-orientedand bit mapped graphics.andM;* SuperCard supports font and style changes within a text field (whichHyperCard does not).andP;  This is important in many database-publishingapplications.andM;* In HyperCard, you deal with one stack at a time.andP;  In SuperCard, you canhave several stacks open on the screen at the same time.andP;  This permits morecomplex applications to be developed.andM;Silicon Beach has added many other features, including a set of animationfunctions.andM;SuperCard will be available in the second quarter of 1989 at a list price of$199.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
