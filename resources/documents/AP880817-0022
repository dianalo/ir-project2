SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Rising temperatures across America areoverwhelming vulnerable people and could kill thousands, accordingto an authority on health and the environment.   ``This will probably emerge as one of the largest naturaldisasters of this century ... and it will have just whispered itsway by,'' said W. Moulton Avery, executive director of the Centerfor Environmental Physiology in Washington.   By ones and twos, the poor and elderly are succumbing to theheat, which overtaxes their bodies, he said. But most of thesetragedies will pass with little notice, being recorded ingovernment statistics as heart attacks or strokes, rather thanheat-related fatalities.   In the end, Avery warned Tuesday, this summer's stiflingtemperatures threaten to exact a higher death toll than the 1980heat wave that killed an estimated 15,000 Americans,   ``If I had in my hand right now the number of people that havedied this summer (from heat) it would be front-page news all overthe country, but I don't have that number,'' said Avery, whosenon-profit center researches the effects of heat and cold on humansfor government agencies and other clients.   He has argued for a reporting system to record heat deaths, butstatisticians must depend on comparing deaths during heat waveyears with ``normal'' years and calculating the excess fatalities.That was the system used to determine the 15,000 extra deaths in1980.   ``What we're living through now is the same thing we were livingthrough in 1980,'' and is worse than many other hot summers, hesaid.   Normal death rates nearly doubled from Oklahoma east during a1966 heat wave _ with deaths jumping to five times normal in St.Louis _ according to the National Oceanic and AtmosphericAdministration.   The Senate Special Committee on Aging later reported that heatwaves in 1963 and 1966 claimed a total of 11,000 lives.   And a University of California at Berkeley study found that hotspells in Los Angeles in 1939, 1955 and 1963 each produced moreexcess deaths than any recorded natural disaster in that state,including the San Francisco earthquake and fire of 1906.   Those most vulnerable to heat stress are the elderly, whoalready may suffer various ailments, Avery said. In 1980 theelderly accounted for 70 percent of the excess deaths in the hotweather, he said.   After a few days of a heat wave, the elderly begin to arrive athospitals with heat-related problems, said Dr. Keith Sivertson,director of emergency medicine at Johns Hopkins School of Medicinein Baltimore.   Older people, he said, ``are more vulnerable for a variety ofreasons. Mostly because their physiologic reserve is gone with age.Their heart function tends to be just enough, their mental functiontends to be just enough, all of their organs are functioning justenough. For some folks, it's not quite enough on some days, andthey end up in the hospital.''   In addition, he noted, the elderly use more prescriptionmedications, and many of those drugs can increase sensitivity toheat.   Heat-caused deaths do not arouse the concern they should becauseof the lack of a reporting system, Avery said.   As a result, only classic cases of heat stroke get reportedofficially as heat deaths to the Centers for Disease Control, andthose amount to perhaps 200 in a normal summer and 1,500 to 1,600in a hot summer such as 1980, he said.</TEXT></DOC>
