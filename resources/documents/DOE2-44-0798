<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-44-0798 </DOCNO><TEXT>Evolution kinetics of electron transverse energy band populations, whena monocrystal moves in axial channels, is investigated taking into accountall factors changing the population. Almost all electrons are shown toleave the channel at the relatively small depth (about 3 {mu}m). Thekinetic problem solution permitted to calculate the linear electron radiationspectrum.The form of the line irradiated in different cases is investigated. Thedetector function is shown to be able to distort noticeably the lineform. Comparison of calculational and experimental radiation spectrais carried out, and good agreement is reached. The possibility to receivethe information about the crystal by the linear radiation spectra ofchannelled electrons is discussed.</TEXT></DOC>
