Twenty-nine of the42 chemicals are highly toxic and over one third might possibly be foundat hazardous waste land disposal facilities. In some instances, short-termexposure to the 29 chemicals in pure form could lead to death or permanentinjury. In addition to toxicity, some of the chemicals are known or aresuspected of having other harmful effects on humans or animals. Owners/operatorsof hazardous waste land disposal facilities are required to initiallymonitor the characteristics of groundwater for detection of contamination.Despite this requirement, the Environmental Protection Agency proposeddeleting the 42 chemicals from testing - a proposal which elicited queriesfrom two congressional committees. So far, EPA's final regulations onthe proposal have not yet been issued.</TEXT></DOC>
