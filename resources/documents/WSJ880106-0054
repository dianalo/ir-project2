Barbed wire still rings the old detention center south of the city, a low building now used as a school. Children hunch over picture books in what used to be the torture chamber. Outside, hibiscuses bloom where, survivors say, the gallows once stood.    But are bad memories enough to guard against a return to -- even a desire for -- military rule? Recent events in Tucuman show how quickly Argentina's idealistic new voters, voters who elected civilian President Raul Alfonsin on a human-rights platform just four years ago, can start yearning for the rigors of martial law when the economy sours.    Tucuman province, one of the nation's poorest, was the birthplace of a leftist guerrilla movement in the early 1970s. In 1975, it was the first place in Argentina to come under military law. Hundreds of reports are on record here of illegal detentions, torture and assassinations from 1976 to 1977, when a blue-eyed, iron-fisted general named Antonio Bussi governed the province.    Though Argentina passed a law last spring exonerating hundreds of subordinates, the 61-year-old Gen. Bussi, now retired from the military, still faces prosecution on charges of abusing human rights. So what did long-suffering Tucumanos do at last September's gubernatorial election? Nearly 100,000 of them voted for Gen. Bussi. And he hadn't even campaigned.    &quot;People are always complaining about Bussi's authoritarianism,&quot; explains Lucrecia Mirande, a lawyer and a Bussi supporter. &quot;But the authoritarianism of this false democracy that we have now is a thousand times worse.&quot; It is Mrs. Mirande's opinion that the province's civilian politicians are liars and thieves who never keep their promises.    Tucuman (pronounced too-koo-MAHN) was the only province in Argentina unable to elect a governor that September day. Nineteen candidates split the vote. Gen. Bussi and three civilians were the frontrunners. While the three civilians bickered for weeks and tried to make a deal, Gen. Bussi held himself aloof from the brokering and simply declared that he should be the governor.    Public opinion, fed up with the bickering, swung behind the general. When the civilian candidates finally struck a deal and named Jose Damato, a 69-year-old Peronist, as governor early last month -- he was inaugurated Dec. 10 -- Bussi supporters declared the decision &quot;absolutely null.&quot; Pro-Bussi riot police called in to quell the protests started a brawl.    The general's popularity demonstrates more than Argentines' ambivalence about strong leadership. It also demonstrates this nation's inability, a decade after the military's &quot;dirty war&quot; against subversion, to come to terms with that era. Argentina is so divided that the president has called it &quot;close to civil war.&quot; Many Argentine civilians feel that the military went overboard in the 1970s, secretly jailing, torturing and executing people who had only the most tenuous links to dissidence -- or no links at all. But military men feel they saved Argentina from communism in those days and should be honored, not put on trial.    &quot;The crisis of Tucuman isn't just a crisis of Tucuman,&quot; says local historian Loni Pinto. &quot;It's a crisis of the whole country.&quot;    Tucuman, about 600 miles northwest of Buenos Aires, is a city of half a million people, of chuckholed sidewalks, moldy colonial houses, drooping spider webs of pirate telephone lines. The vast city park, filled with white stone maidens and laurel-wreathed discus throwers brought from Europe a century ago, is mute testimony to better times long past. Sugar cane was king here once, but cane prices have been down for years, and now Tucuman's youth unemployment rate is 24%.    The military has controlled Argentina for 28 of the past 57 years. Between dictatorships, whenever Tucumanos have had a chance to vote, they have picked Peronist governors. They always had good luck with the mass-based, populist Peronists. Farm prices were higher in those days, Argentina was richer, and Peronist officials could spend a lot of money giving out houses, jobs, food, even Christmas presents to their supporters.    The last military government ruled Argentina from 1976 to 1983. When democracy returned and Tucumanos could vote once again, they had little to go on but their pre-junta memories. So in 1983 they elected another Peronist governor, Fernando Riera, an old-time party boss who had governed the province in the 1950s.    Unfortunately, Argentina had no money for Peronist patronage anymore. And Mr. Riera was a very old, sick man who by the time his term ended last month could barely read, speak or move. At a time when the nation has no margin for economic error, Tucuman is paying dearly for its uninformed vote.    &quot;Everybody knows it, but no one wants to say it,&quot; Carlos Dionisi, once finance minister under Gov. Riera, said during the final days of the Riera administration. &quot;The governor is a man with 20% of the capacity of a normal human being.&quot; Mr. Dionisi says he used to take the ailing governor decrees and try to explain them to him. &quot;I felt he had to understand them if he was to support me,&quot; he says.    But other government officials took advantage of the governor's failing health to do whatever they pleased. &quot;They would just bring him documents and he would sign them,&quot; says Mr. Dionisi. &quot;Every minister governed for his own account. One minister would commit funds without the consent of the others. There wasn't really any government.&quot;    In a matter of months, Tucuman came unglued. The runaway ministers raised provincial employees' pay. They lowered the legal retirement age. They raised pensions so much that Mr. Dionisi himself retired. The provincial budget deficit, which had never topped 3% of total outlays in the early 1980s, vaulted to 24% in the civilian government's first year. The government put thousands of people on the payroll.    &quot;In the government offices, there aren't even chairs for all these people,&quot; says Fernando Hevia, a local businessman. &quot;They had to make shifts, just so that people could come to work and sit down.&quot;    Then the ministers had to pay for it all. They printed some new money, called &quot;debt cancellation bonds.&quot; When those proved insufficient, they created yet another currency, called &quot;letters of exchange.&quot; Even then the province couldn't meet its bloated payroll. It started delaying paydays. Strikes broke out. The government started paying again, but inflation had shrunk the value of the money. Frustrated teachers, doctors and police were soon burning tires and chanting slogans in the plaza.    The province, poor to begin with, hit rock bottom. &quot;Several children have died for lack of food,&quot; says Reynaldo Mamani, a resident of the San Roque slum on a riverbank south of the city. He and others there say the food-relief agency that used to feed them stopped last April. In the city itself, says economist Ramon Medina, the hospital is full of sick children whose mothers have given them nothing but tea and sugar for days at a time.    Across the street from the imported statuary of the city park stands the Bernabe Araoz grade school, low and blue-shuttered. Women teach here in sultry little classrooms with crumbling ceilings. Pay is about $90 a month. Teachers say they can't recall a single week in the past four years when they didn't go on strike.    In the courtyard, under a corrugated metal roof, a score of mothers wait in line for their children's report cards. &quot;I have three children and they're completely disoriented,&quot; complains Juana Rodriguez de Galub, a short woman in a yellow summer dress. &quot;It's the government's fault. If they don't pay the teachers, of course they're going to strike. Nobody works for free.&quot;    Who got her vote last September? &quot;Gen. Bussi,&quot; she says. &quot;I think we need a hard hand.&quot;    No one exemplifies a hard hand like Gen. Bussi. Today his years as military governor are shrouded in legend. People say he never slept. They say he reconnoitered the province every day by helicopter, turning up at hospitals, construction sites and sugar mills in full combat garb. He ordered all public employees out to the plaza every morning at 7 for a daily flag-raising and patriotic songfest.    &quot;He was in the Government House from 7 in the morning to 11 at night,&quot; marvels Miguel Jose Elias, the general's minister of the economy. &quot;Many officials got sick and quit. They couldn't keep up.&quot;    The general bulldozed the national government into raising controlled sugar-cane prices. Then he taxed the cane growers' windfall -- and used the money to pave Tucuman's boulevards and line them with statues of martyred soldiers. He walled off the slums. He ordered townspeople to paint their rooftop water tanks sky-blue and white, the national colors.    &quot;He wanted to hide everything that was bad,&quot; says housewife Perla Noe de Cohen.    Were there beggars in the streets? Gen. Bussi rounded them up, trucked them over the border and left them to blight the neighboring province. Were peasants in the mountains sheltering guerrillas? Gen. Bussi built four whole new towns from the ground up, posted watchmen atop the water towers and transplanted the peasants.    &quot;In front of the Government House, there were four huge palm trees, right by the doorway,&quot; recalls Dora de Man, an innkeeper's wife, as she has coffee and cookies in Mrs. Noe de Cohen's living room. &quot;One night he was walking by at 2 or 3 in the morning -- because he didn't sleep -- and he noticed that one of the palm trees had died. So at that very moment, 3 in the morning, he called the director of parks and gardens and said, 'I want a palm tree, the same size as the other three, and I want it now.' The park director said, `Yes, sir, but you can't just transplant a full-grown palm tree. You have to plant it when it's small, and wait for it to grow.'    &quot;But Bussi insisted. So at that hour of the night, they went to the park with the fire truck and dug up a palm tree, and they carried it over to the Government House and replanted it in front. Naturally, it died. That's Bussi.&quot;    &quot;Terrible things happened, but we didn't dare open our mouths,&quot; says Mrs. Noe de Cohen. Her brother disappeared in 1976, 10 days before his wedding day. &quot;He and his fiancee had already rented an apartment,&quot; she says. &quot;He was supposed to meet her at a furniture store one afternoon at 2 o'clock. He never arrived. So she went back home and found that their apartment had been raided. They had taken out seven suitcases. It was as if a moving company had come through. But none of the neighbors saw anything. There was so much fear.&quot;    &quot;I spent those years in terror,&quot; says Mrs. de Man. &quot;I had two sons in the university then, and young people were disappearing every day.&quot;    &quot;People saw all this, but they have forgotten,&quot; says Mrs. Noe de Cohen. &quot;It would take a psychiatrist to tell you how hungry people have to get before they can forget a thing like this.&quot;    Across town, in another colonial house flanked by sky-blue and white flags, Gen. Bussi is addressing a meeting of his followers. Gen. Bussi says a Bussi government would overhaul Tucuman, but he doesn't say how. His economic program boils down to making everyone work harder. &quot;The ultimate synthesis of life is work,&quot; he says.    Waiters pass out hot empanadas and Mrs. Bussi serves red wine from a tray.    &quot;Children are running in the streets without any education,&quot; says Mrs. Mirande, the lawyer. &quot;Loose! No one pays any attention. Everyone just wastes time on political games.&quot;    &quot;They're always playing the game of democracy, while people are dying of hunger,&quot; says Oscar Paz. He was the mayor of Tucuman when Gen. Bussi was governor.    &quot;The whole project of government has fallen asleep,&quot; says Mrs. Mirande. &quot;There has been a complete absence of brains. This is anarchy.&quot;    &quot;Incoherence,&quot; says Mr. Paz.    &quot;When they say democracy, they mean letting everyone do whatever they want,&quot; says Mrs. Mirande. &quot;To me, democracy means order.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
