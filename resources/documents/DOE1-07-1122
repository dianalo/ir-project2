<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-07-1122 </DOCNO><TEXT>A medical radiodiagnostic system prising the GKS-2 scintillation gammachamber and the on-line data processing system is described. The gammachamber consists of a detector, a two-channel control console, a microprocessorsystem for correction of distortions,system of photographic recordingof images from an oscilloscopic display, a digital display-monitor and6 accessiory collimators with trucks. GKS-2 has the increased spatialresolution, fast response and image homogeneity. Application of GKS-2together with the SAORI-01 specialized on-line system,comprising themeasuring computerized system, the colour-graphic display controllerthe polarizer photographic recording device for scanning image from thedisplay screen and a system of base software, expands substantially diagnosticpossibilities of equipment.</TEXT></DOC>
