<DOC><DOCNO> DOE1-69-0490 </DOCNO><TEXT>Purpose: To easily attain equilibrium arrangement of doughnuts type plasmashaving a longitudinal non-circular cross section with vertical asymmetry.Constitution: The device of this invention comprises means for generatingvertical asymmetry adapted to generate signals in proportion to the changewith time of vertical asymmetry of plasmas during electric discharge,a standard plasma position calculation means for calculating the standardposition of plasmas based on the vertical asymmetry and a current calculationmeans for cross sectional shape controlling magnetic field coils adaptedto calculate the current supplied to the cross sectional shape controllingmagnetic field coils based on the vertical asymmetry. This device controlseasily the positions and shapes of plasma, and gives plasma having largecross sectional shapes and good confinement properties. (Kamimura, M.).</TEXT></DOC>
