Orenstein, a XeroxCorp. attorney, at a GCN-sponsored conference in Washington on procurementintegrity.andM;A top Agriculture Department official agreed.andP;  &quot;We've approached this fromthe standpoint that this is something we've always tried to do,&quot; said GlennP. Haney, director of the Office of Information Resources Management.andP;  &quot;We'renot sure that it's broken so we may not need to fix it.&quot;andM;When the new statute first was proposed, many observers said it would hindergovernment technology buys.andP;  But that attitude is changing.andM;&quot;I don't think anyone in Agriculture thinks now that they won't be able toget what they need,&quot; Haney said.andM;Agriculture officials prepared new guidelines about the law and are trainingemployees on an ad hoc, need-to-know basis, he said.andM;&quot;We probably have not approached that as thoroughly as we should have,&quot; hesaid.andP;  &quot;There's not been as much top-down direction in the training andguidance as there should have been and as some people wanted, but I thinkit's working.&quot;andM;But both agency and industry speakers said that until they have moreexperience with the law, they would interpret its mandates conservatively.andO;&quot;All of us have seen the evidence all around us that there is a need for morevigilance in procurement,&quot; Haney said.andM;Parts Are UnclearandM;Another reason for caution is that many parts of the law are unclear.andP;  TheOffice of Management and Budget recently released draft regulations whichcreated further questions and debate.andM;But OMB officials assured the House Government Operations Committee the finalregulations would be issued next month.andP;  Committee members hope theregulations will answer any lingering questions, said William S. Coleman Jr.,andO;the committee's assistant counsel on procurement.andP;  If not, Congress could actto further clarify the law, he said.andM;The confusion over how the law should be carried out has made even theJustice Department a little wary, said Stephen R. Colgate, deputy assistantattorney general for information and administrative services.andM;&quot;At Justice we're in an unusual position -- we're Caesar's wife -- we have tobe beyond reproach,&quot; he said.andP;  &quot;So we have taken a very strict interpretationof how we should deal with this.&quot;andM;But officials cautioned that companies and agency contracting personnelshould use common sense and avoid &quot;silly notions&quot; that result in stiflingtechnology.andM;&quot;If you carry these laws to the extreme you sound foolish,&quot; Orenstein said.andM;Some vendors, though, questioned whether the laws are needed at all.andP;  &quot;Wereally hope to turn off the adverse legislation,&quot; said Robert Trimble, vicepresident of contracting for Martin Marietta Corp. Trimble's own statisticsshow an average of 55 congressional actions each year since 1974 thataffected DOD procurement processes.andM;Trimble said he thinks there is no greater threat today from fraud in theacquisition process than when he first started work in the government in1955.andP;  &quot;In my judgment, the procurement integrity provisions were notnecessary,&quot; he said.andM;Other vendors said it will not be difficult to adhere to the laws.andP;  &quot;For manycompanies, it's not a matter of creating a procurement integrity program,it's a matter of publicizing and perhaps fine-tuning a current policy,&quot; saidMarc Rigrodsky, an attorney with the Federal Systems Group of DigitalEquipment Corp.andM;The laws do not break much new ground either, speakers said.andP;  Other than thecertification requirement, which mandates that agencies and companies trainand certify all employees working on procurements of $100,000 or more, thelaw covers issues found in many other statutes.andM;Congressional research staff members found, however, the laws on the booksbefore procurement integrity all dealt with criminal offenses, said a staffmember of the Senate Governmental Affairs Committee.andM;The procurement integrity law broadens the scope of ethics laws by includingcivil penalties, he said.andM;Origins DebatedandM;Much conference debate centered on when a procurement begins, because the lawrequires agencies to protect source selection and proprietary information.andO;Agency officials have tended to strictly regulate agency-vendor relationsonce this arbitrary line is crossed.andP;  The industry speakers warned againstagencies being overly conservative and stifling discussions with vendors tooearly in the procurement preparation process.andM;Haney and Colgate said that on some procurements they think procurementaction begins long before a request for proposals hits the street.andP;  Grahamsaid the Air Force uses the RFP release as a working date.andM;But vendors said it is important not to define too strictly the time anaction begins.andM;&quot;It's very, very important on the part of the government to allow thecommunications to continue during the request for information and draft RFPstages,&quot; Trimble said.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
