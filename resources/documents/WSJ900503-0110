He says the jury ruled that Sylvia Seegrist's &quot;crime wasthe fault of the shopping mall.&quot; In fact, the jury found thatthe mall and its security staff were &quot;negligent&quot; in failingto take reasonable precautions that would have prevented theSeegrist rampage. As a professor, he should know thedifference between the two.</LP><TEXT>   Semantics aside, judge for yourself the facts of whatoccurred at the Springfield Mall prior to and on Oct. 30,1985, the day Sylvia Seegrist shot and killed three peopleand seriously wounded seven others.   As Prof. Sherman notes, Ms. Seegrist had been a nuisanceat the mall over a period of time. But after the mass murderof 21 people at a McDonald's restaurant in San Ysidro,Calif., in 1984, her behavior turned belligerent, she madedeaths threats on several occasions, donned battle fatiguesand combat boots, and acted &quot;bizarrely.&quot; He also noted thatshe had been committed to mental hospitals 12 times and thatduring one such commitment she stabbed a hospital employee.   What he didn't mention was that:   -- Just two weeks before the shootings, Ms. Seegrist wasin the McDonald's at the Springfield Mall threatening to killpeople.   -- No one on the mall's security staff ever bothered tofind out Ms. Seegrist's mental state or her police record.   -- No one on the mall's security staff ever called thelocal police to notify them of the threats Ms. Seegrist hadmade. If they had, she probably would have been banned fromthe mall and possibly recommitted. The local police knew shewas dangerous and the chief of police testified to thateffect at the trial.   -- There was no notification from one security shift toanother of Ms. Seegrist's activities so that some securitypeople had no idea who she was or what she did. No photo hadever been taken of her by security to identify her as aproblem person, something routinely done with anyone whoshoplifts a few dollars' worth of merchandise.   -- There was virtually no training for the security staff,whose main focus was on protecting the premises and propertyof the mall tenants, not the customers' safety.   -- One of the mall security staff saw Ms. Seegrist,dressed in battle gear, take a rifle from the back of her carin the parking lot that fateful day, but took no actionbecause it was the day before Halloween and he thought it wasa prank.   -- Security never called Ms. Seegrist's mother and toldher of her daughter's behavior. If it had, she would havetaken steps to keep Ms. Seegrist out of the mall because sheknew she was dangerous. She had been struck by her daughteron more than one occasion.   -- One forensic psychiatrist testified at the trial thatMs. Seegrist picked the Springfield Mall not by coincidence,but because she felt &quot;comfortable&quot; there. Why? Because shetested the limits of what the mall would let her get awaywith and found there were no serious limits on her outrageousbehavior.   In his article, Prof. Sherman said &quot;foreseeability&quot; was a&quot;crucial legal question&quot; in this case. He reasoned that ifthe mall's security staff could not foresee what happenedthat day, the mall should not be held negligent and liable.To prove his point, he cited statistics that the odds on whathappened in the Springfield Mall were &quot;1 in 156 million&quot; andthe &quot;prior rate of such crimes by women nationwide was zero.&quot;   Now it's all well and good to cite probability in acourtroom, but can you imagine a $3.75-an-hour security guardstopping and computing the odds on mass murder when heencounters a person making terroristic threats? Of coursenot. But one can reasonably expect a security guardconfronted by someone in battle gear holding a rifle to stopthat person, and say, &quot;Pardon me, but guns are not allowed inthe mall.&quot; And then to call the appropriate authorities.   The reality is that an underpaid, poorly trained securitystaff at the Springfield Mall did not take &quot;reasonable care&quot;as is specified by Pennsylvania law for public places, i.e.to exercise reasonable care to discover that intentionallyharmful acts of third persons are being done or are likely tobe done and to give warning to enable visitors to avoid theharm or to protect them against it.   Is it any wonder the jury took less than three hours tofind the Springfield Mall and its management guilty ofnegligence?   Rodger L.
