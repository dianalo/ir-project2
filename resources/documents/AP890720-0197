The chairman called the collider project the most importantscientific effort in the nation.   But the chairman, Sen. Bennett Johnston, D-La., said anamendment may be introduced in the full Appropriations Committeethat would hold up the $4.4 billion project until foreigngovernments agree to participate.   Johnston, head of the Appropriations Committee's energy andwater development subcommittee and also of the Senate Energy andNatural Resources Committee, said he would oppose such a condition.   ``There's sentiment in our committee to adopt report languagewhich will, in effect, say don't give away the great technologicalcontracts to the Japanese or to any other participant,'' Johnstonsaid.   Committee reports are not binding, but the reports are veryinfluential in guiding administration decisions.   Explaining his support of the collider, planned for a site 30miles south of Dallas, Johnston said, ``It unlocks the secret ofwhat we're made of, what the universe is made of, what energy andmatter and all of the basic stuff of the universe is made of andit's exciting.''   He said he has ``limited enthusiasm'' for enlisting othercountries to share the cost: ``I think this research is soimportant we ought to do it in this country if we can and not farmit out to have somebody else build the most important technologicalparts of it.''   While President Bush had sought $250 million for the fiscal yearbeginning Oct. 1, Johnston said budget constraints forced him tosettle on $225 million. The House has voted $200 million, and ifthe project survives, the two Houses will have to agree on anamount.</TEXT></DOC>
