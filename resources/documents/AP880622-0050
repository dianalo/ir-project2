Nevertheless, Reagan, who came to office pledging to crack downon waste, fraud and abuse, said Tuesday ``all of us aredisappointed and upset that such things happen.''   But he appeared to excuse himself of any responsibility.   The president commented at a news conference in Toronto at theend of the three-day economic summit of major industrialdemocracies. Later, he delivered a speech urging economic allies toexpand free trade and resist protectionism.   After celebrating his last summit with what he said was a``measure of pride,'' Reagan returned to Washington, where themushrooming Pentagon case and lingering fallout from theIran-Contra scandal are likely to occupy much of the seven monthsthat remain of his term.   At the news conference, his second this month, Reagan fieldedonly a few questions about economics. Instead, the focus was onother issues.   About the drought now plaguing much of the United States, Reagansaid it was too early to say what the government could do to helpfarmers recover.   ``Outside of praying for rain, there isn't anything I can do''until a government task force submits a report on the problem nextweek.   The president also suggested he favors restrictions on handgunpurchases, so that buyers would be required to take some trainingbefore they can buy a weapon.   Reagan said he would like to see states adopt a system in whichpeople have to have a background check ``of any crimes or anymental problems'' before they can buy guns.   The gun ownership issue arose in response to a question about anincident in which columnist Carl Rowan shot a teen-ager whoallegedly was trespassing in his swimming pool late at night.   Speaking about the allegations of scandal at the Pentagon,Reagan said, ``I have to say that I think it should beunderstandable how such things can happen in something as big asour government is.''   Federal prosecutors this week revealed a widespreadinvestigation into corruption in the Pentagon weapons purchasingsystem and disclosed that wiretaps had been used to record morethan 4,700 telephone conversations.   Reagan said that in something as complex as Pentagon buying,``you can't be down there watching several million people and thetotal of all of the companies and the Defense Department every dayand what they're doing, or what phone calls they're making.   ``And I'm quite sure that no one would think that we should betapping all of those phones and listening in on conversations ofeverybody just on the suspicion that someone might be out ofline,'' Reagan said.   The president largely excused former Defense Secretary CasparWeinberger for any problem that occurred in his seven years at thePentagon.   ``For him to take some responsibility _ of course he was headingup there, and I suppose I could do the same thing,'' Reagan said.   However, he said the whole affair was uncovered by thegovernment, and that ``they've been tracking this down to finallythe place where they have come to the point in which they feel theycan serve indictments.''   On other matters:   _Reagan said he doubted that huge losses in the savings and loanindustry would add up to a crisis. ``I certainly hope not and Idon't think so,'' Reagan said. However, he acknowledged ``there isa problem there and we're trying'' to deal with it.   _The president said ``there's no scandal'' in the Iran-Contraaffair which has resulted in several indictments, including thoseof former White House aides Oliver North and John Poindexter. Thefederal judge in the case has indicated he wants to begin thetrials shortly, starting with North.   Asked if he would pardon North and Poindexter before theirtrials, Reagan said their case in court ``has to go forward or theywould live the rest of their lives under a shadow of guilt. So Ihave no intention of''... . He did not finish the sentence.   _Reagan, discussing the American hostages in Lebanon, said, ``totell you the truth, I don't know whether they're alive today.''</TEXT></DOC>
