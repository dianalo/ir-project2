By contrast with fossil fuels, nuclear fuels are energy resourceswhich can be used practically only for the provision of energy, and thusdirectly affect the conservation of more valuable resources. On the basisof the boundary conditions with respect to worldwide energy supply, thecontribution of nuclear energy to electrical energy supplies will beillustrated in terms of national and world figures. Prospects will beconsidered as to the future possibility of further development of provensystems for nuclear energy utilization, while appraising the developmentand significance of advanced systems which will also open up new marketsin the interconnected energy system for the primary resource nuclearenergy.</TEXT></DOC>
