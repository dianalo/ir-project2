An Armenian dissident said``thugs'' beat and knifed Armenians as the ethnic hatred kindled bya territorial dispute spread in the Caucasus republics.   A Soviet deputy prosecutor general said over the weekend thattwo people in another region of Azerbaidzhan had been killed in``disorders'' sparked by Armenian demands that a part ofAzerbaidzhan be reattached to their republic.   Street demonstrations, in which some witnesses said more than 1million people participated, took place in the Armenian capital ofYerevan last week to call for the annexation of theNagorno-Karabakh region in Azerbaidzhan, whose 157,000 inhabitantsare mostly Armenian.   Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev appealed Friday to the peopleof Armenia and Azerbaidzhan for ``civic maturity,'' but state-runmedia reports and accounts reaching dissident circles in Moscow onMonday indicated he had failed to quell the dispute.   The official Tass news agency said a ``group of hooligansprovoked disturbances'' Sunday in the industrial city of Sumgait,1,150 miles south of Moscow on the Caspian Sea. ``Rampage andviolence followed,'' it said.   The Tass dispatch on the unrest in Sumgait was the firstofficial report of civil disturbances in the Soviet Union since itreported that 3,000 people rioted in Alma Ata, capital of theCentral Asian republic of Kazakhstan, in December 1986. Two peopledied and hundreds were injured in those riots.   Tass gave no indication what led to the violence in Sumgait, achemical and steelmaking center that is Azerbaidzhan's mostimportant industrial city after its capital, Baku.   A Moscow-based dissident said the disturbance was sparked bytensions between Azerbaidzhan's dominant ethnic group, the Azeris,and Armenians. Azeris are predominantly Moslem, while Armenians arepredominantly Christian.   ``Thugs in Sumgait went up to people and asked them if they wereArmenian or not,'' said Sergei Grigoyants, who is of Armenianorigin. ``They started to beat up people who said they wereArmenian. Several people were knifed.''   Grigoyants, who said he had received information on the unrestfrom sources in Yerevan, said apparently no one was killed in theSunday fracas. He said ``several dozen'' Azeris reportedly wereinvolved in the attacks.   Tass indicated that authorities in Sumgait, a city of more than160,000 people, fear a resurgence of violence.   ``Measures have been taken to normalize the situation in thecity and safeguard discipline and public order,'' Tass said, addingthat an investigation was under way.   The watch officer at the Ministry of Internal Affairs in Baku,reached by telephone Monday evening, said he had no information onthe disturbances in the city 22 miles to the northwest. AnAzerbaidzhan government official in Moscow refused comment.   Sumgait is 150 miles northeast of the disputed region ofNagorno-Karabakh, a region smaller than the U.S. state of Delaware,which traditionally had been part of Armenia until the Sovietgovernment put it under the jurisdiction of Azerbaidzhan in 1923.   Deputy Prosecutor General Alexander Katusev was dispatched fromMoscow last week to investigate reports that the clash overNagorno-Karabakh had led to ethnic bloodshed between Azeris andArmenians.   In a weekend report on Baku state-run radio, Katusev said twopeople in a district of Azerbaidzhan that borders the contestedregion ``fell victim to murder'' in disorders linked to theterritorial dispute.   Katusev identified the dead as Bakhtiar Uliyev, 16, and AliGadzhiyev, 23, both of the Agdamsky district. Several other people,he said, ``suffered bruises, beatings and injuries that do notthreaten their life and health.''   The prosecutor spoke over Baku radio on Saturday, in a reportthat was monitored by the British Broadcasting Co. in London.   ``There are no other victims or people who were maimed either inNagorno-Karabakh or any other part of the republic (ofAzerbaidzhan),'' Katusev said.   However, Valery Senderov, another Moscow-based dissident, saidFriday that there had been street scuffles in Baku when Armeniansdemonstrated outside three downtown movie theaters last week todemand that Nagorno-Karabakh be made part of Armenia.   ``Blood was spilled,'' Senderov said, citing telephone reportshe received from sources in Azerbaidzhan. He said no seriousinjuries were reported.   Gorbachev told the party leadership in a Feb. 18 speech thatrelations among the more than 100 ethnic groups that make up theSoviet population is the country's greatest problem. He said theparty Central Committee would hold a meeting to discuss thoserelations.   Armenian broadcasts Friday also said the Central Committee wouldreconsider whether it should reattach Nagorno-Karabakh to Armenia.It refused such a request in January.</TEXT></DOC>
