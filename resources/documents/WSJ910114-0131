Alongside the provocations that preceded the crackdown inLithuania, which has been trying to declare itselfindependent of Moscow since early last year, the Sovietleadership has been drifting toward a harder line for severalmonths. President Mikhail Gorbachev's increasinglyconservative decrees and political appointments have come intandem with an ominous choking of glasnost. Official printand television coverage of the events in Lithuania evokesimages of old-style Soviet manipulation of the facts.</LP><TEXT>   The drift away from liberalism started as far back asJuly, when two key liberal Gorbachev supporters resigned fromthe party Politburo. The influence of both men, AlexanderYakovlev and Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, began todecline.   Hopes for a coalition between Mr. Gorbachev and popularRussian Republic leader Boris Yeltsin were dashed in October,when the president abandoned a joint economic program infavor of a more cautious version. A series of conservativepolitical appointments and increasingly hardline presidentialdecrees followed. In December, Mr. Gorbachev's last liberalminister, Mr. Shevardnadze, resigned his post, warning of acoming dicatatorship.   Liberals held out some hope that Mr. Gorbachev's newcabinet appointments would prove he is still trying tobalance right against left rather than drifting firmlyrightward in an attempt to consolidate his power. The fullpicture still isn't clear, but so far his choices indicatethe latter.   The new vice president is Gennady Yanaev, a longtimeCommunist Party bureaucrat widely viewed as a natural &quot;yesman.&quot; A delegate to Saturday's meeting of the FederationCouncil of heads of republics said Mr. Gorbachev disclosedthat his first choice for prime minister is Finance MinisterValentin Pavlov, who has worked hand in hand with currentPremier Nikolai Ryzhkov in guiding the economy through itsdecline. &quot;Pavlov comes from the same mold as Ryzhkov,&quot; saidradical democrat Igor Chubais. &quot;There's no difference atall.&quot;   That nomination still must be approved by the SovietParliament, but it isn't expected to encounter anydifficulty. Mr. Gorbachev is scheduled to present othercabinet nominations to the Parliament today.   Mr. Shevardnadze's resignation marked a turning point inanother aspect of the repression: a tightening of pressure onthe media. The most outspokenly critical television programon the state channel, Vzglyad, was canceled by the head ofthe state television station for trying to air a segment onthe resignation. It has since been ordered off the air, forfive weeks so far, although the producers have offered topull the offending segment.   &quot;We are afraid this is one of the indications of change inthe political course in this country,&quot; says Andrei Shepilov,producer of VID, which includes the Vzglyad program. &quot;I'mafraid that everything that's happening to us is just thefirst stage.&quot;   On Saturday, the nation's only major independent newsagency, Interfax, was kicked out of its offices in the stateradio and television building, allegedly for not paying itsbills. The agency is resettling with the help of Mr. Yeltsin.   Several mainstream newspapers that often printedanti-government articles earlier in the year have in the pasttwo months begun calling for a strong central power. Only onedaily, Komsomolskaya Pravda, is still taking a clearlyliberal line.   Last week, the party daily Pravda brought back memories ofthe pre-glasnost decades as it printed a long philosophicalletter supposedly written by Oleg Gusareivich, a mechanic ona collective farm outside Moscow named for the 50thanniversary of the October revolution. The letter attackedthe &quot;democratic mass media&quot; for fostering crime, prostitutionand violence. &quot;Glasnost more and more becomes the tool of acivil war,&quot; he wrote. &quot;It's already not freedom of speech buta means of ideological violence of the owners' class.&quot; Pravdahas been known to concoct such letters in its own offices.   The coverage of the Lithuanian crisis has been the mostblatant and disheartening example of this fading of freespeech. When the crackdown began, the official Vremyatelevision news program mentioned no military activity,instead highlighting pro-Moscow demonstrations in Vilnius.Last night the show insisted that Lithuanian resisters werethe first to fire shots. Likewise, Pravda, after the firstLithuanian deaths were known, printed a small front-page boxsaying only that a national salvation committee was takingover and that 1,000 people had demonstrated in favor of thecentral government.   Meanwhile, a late-night news program that is regularlymore outspoken than Vremya has been postponed for severalhours each night and sometimes not shown at all. Saturdaynight, two hours late, it aired footage from Lithuaniantelevision and said it had been forced to censor it inMoscow.   The official news agency Tass all along has read likesomething out of &quot;1984.&quot; It has strictly maintained the linethat the trouble in Lithuania is all due to internal disordercaused by the ineffectiveness of the local government andthat the people there are calling for central authorities tostep in.   &quot;The situation in Lithuania became sharply aggravated inrecent days as a result of the heightening of tension by therepublic's leadership,&quot; Tass said yesterday after the long,bloody night in Vilnius. &quot;This led to the authorities' losingcontrol.&quot;   Republican leaders and reformers are worried that withouta free press, the public will be thrust back into theignorance that kept it safely under control for generations.People &quot;don't know what's going on and believe that inLithuania people were fighting because of inter-ethnicconflicts,&quot; Lithuanian representative Nikolai Medvedev saidat a solidarity rally in Moscow yesterday. &quot;Each of us shouldtell the truth to at least 10 other people so that everyonein the Soviet Union will know this truth.&quot;</TEXT></DOC>
