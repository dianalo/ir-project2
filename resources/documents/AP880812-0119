The amendment, backed only by the governing Motherland Party,passed 284-95 in the 450-seat legislature a week ago.   Turkey's 1982 Constitution, written under military rule,requires at least five years between local elections. That meantlocal elections could not be held in Turkey before March 1989.   The amendment calls for local elections nationwide on Nov. 13.   But the nation must vote on any constitutional amendment adoptedby fewer than 300 votes in Parliament.   The referendum is expected to take place Sept. 25.   Political analysts say the governing party wants early pollspartly because they do not want to give the main opposition SocialDemocrats time to organize under new leadership.</TEXT></DOC>
