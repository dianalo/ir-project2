(most valuable players)</TITLE><AUTHOR>Bermar, Amy.andM;</AUTHOR><TEXT><ABSTRACT>The aim of test engineers is to detect potential flaws in aproduct before it ships, by writing the software that will guidethe testing devices through every aspect of the product.andP;  Toooften, though, test engineers are only allowed access to theproduct after it is completed.andP;  At this late stage in thedevelopment process, any problems they may encounter can lead toextensive product delays.andP;  One way around the problem is to engageengineers in the design process at an early stage, architectingthe product so testing can begin at its infancy and structuring adesign strategy that incorporates testing.andP;  Although conflicts mayarise in the sacrificing of performance or size, testing early canprevent expensive and lengthy re-designing in the latter stages.andM;</ABSTRACT></TEXT><DESCRIPT>Topic:     TestingEngineering ServicesProduct DevelopmentPlanningTeam ApproachManagement StyleComputer-aided engineeringResearch Design.andM;</DESCRIPT></DOC>
