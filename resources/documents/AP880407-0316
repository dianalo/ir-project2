ROSENFELD</BYLINE><BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Dairy farmers complained Thursday theyare not sharing in the agricultural economy's rebound from thedevastating farm recession of the mid-1980s.   ``Dairy farmers are facing a rough year while the rest ofagriculture is prospering,'' a farmer told Sen. Charles Grassley,following the Iowa Republican's remarks to the annual meeting ofthe Mid-America Dairymen Inc.   The farmer, who rose from the audience at the meeting of themilk marketing and processing cooperative to question the senator,complained that the price of grain for feeding herds had climbedwhile the price paid farmers for their milk has declined.   ``I can't say I don't disagree,'' Grassley replied. But he noteda ``healthy turn of events'' and added that in all his years as afarmer and member of Congress, he'd ``never seen a time when allsegments of agriculture do well at the same time.''   The government this year reduced dairy price supports by 50cents a hundredweight and another cut is possible next year becauseof surplus production that continued despite an earlier governmentherd buyout program.   Grassley told the meeting that the dairy industry may yet beable to provide alternatives to future cuts in price supports,despite efforts to reduce huge federal budget deficits.   He encouraged dairy farmers to work with cattlemen, as theyrecently did in supporting a beef promotion referendum.   ``The agriculture bloc has become fragmented in recent years,leading to a dangerous reduction in agriculture's politicalsupport,'' the senator said in his speech to the group. ``Thediverse chorus of voices representing agriculture creates difficultchoices for Congress. As Ben Franklin warned competing factionsmore than 200 years ago: `We must all hang together or we shall allhang separately.'''   Despite the call for unity, delegates later amended a resolutionthat would have encouraged members of the cooperative, with assetsof nearly $367 million, to support the beef referendum. Instead,the group voted to be neutral on next month's beef vote.   Tom Townsend, a senior vice president of the cooperative, saidthat change in position will be a bargaining chip in negotiationswith cattlemen to seek their support for dairy programs.   One recent example of unity in the dairy industry was aunanimous recommendation from its National Commission on DairyPolicy, presented March 31 to Congress and the Secretary ofAgriculture.   The proposals by the 18-member panel of dairy farmers fromaround the country was the first unified industry proposal in morethan a decade, said Clyde Rutherford, a Syracuse, N.Y. farmer whois chairman of the commission and president of Dairylea Milk.   ``Everything we've done in the past has been a quick fix,''Rutherford said in an interview after he addressed the Mid-AmericaDairymen. He said the commission tried to come up with a dairypolicy to carry the industry through the end of the century.   ``The commission concluded federal policy should create aneconomic environment that makes profitability possible _but notguaranteed _for the nation's milk producers,'' he told theconvention. ``Those who are efficient, innovative and industriouswill benefit under the commission's plan.''   He also noted that while the recommendations were unanimous,they also were controversial, adding, ``There is something foreveryone to dislike.''   For example, it favors an end to California's separatemanufacturing allowance for milk made into butter, cheese andnonfat dry milk.   Among its major proposals, the commission recommended:   _Giving the secretary of agriculture discretionary authority toraise or lower dairy price supports by 5 percent, with a one-yearlimit of 50 cents a hundredweight.   _Giving the secretary of agriculture discretionary authority toimpose production controls when government purchases of surplusmilk exceed 5 billion pounds in one year, and requiring productioncontrols if surplus stocks rise to 7.5 billion pounds.   _Providing the secretary of agriculture with two options forfuture production controls: a herd buyout program similar to theone that removed 1.1 million cows and heifers from the nation'sherds in 1986-87 or a ``two-tiered'' price system that wouldprovide a reduced price for any milk marketings above a set quota.   _Support of quotas to limit imports of dairy products to keepthe United States from becoming a dumping ground for world foreigndairy surpluses.   Delegates at the 20th annual meeting of the Mid-America Dairymenlater adopted their own legislative goals that included a call forde-emphasizing the use of price supports as a means of controllingdairy supplies.</TEXT></DOC>
