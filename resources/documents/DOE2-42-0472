<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-42-0472 </DOCNO><TEXT>A catalyst composition is described prepared by a process comprising:(a) calcining a crystalline aluminosilicate Y zeolite having crackingactivity in the presence of added steam at a water vapor partial pressuregreater than about 5.0 p.s.i.a. under conditions such that the unit cellsize of the zeolite is reduced to a value between about 24.32 and 24.45Angstroms and the sorptive capacity of the zeolite for water vapor isreduced to a value between about 5 and about 15 weight percent of thezeolite at 25{sup 0}C and a p/p{sup 0} value of 0.10; (b) extruding amixture of the steam calcined aluminosilicate Y zeolite and a porous,inorganic refractory oxide component to form extrudates; (c) calciningthe extrudates in the presence of added steam at a water vapor partialpressure greater than about 5.0 p.s.i.a. under conditions such that theunit cell size of the steamed calcined aluminosilicate zeolite; and (d)impregnating the calcined extrudates with at least one hydrogenationcomponent selected from the group consisting of Group VIA metal componentsand Group VIII metal components.</TEXT></DOC>
