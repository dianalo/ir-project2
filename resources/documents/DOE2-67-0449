(x = 0.00, 0.025, 0.05,0.075, 0.10, 0.125, 0.15, 0.20, 0.25, 0.275, 0.30, 0.325, 0.35, 0.375,0.40 for M = Co; x = 0.025, 0.05, 0.075, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20, 0.30 for M= Zn). The crystallographic data show that an orthorhombic-tetragonalphase transition takes place as Co content increases, while the crystalstructure exhibit drastic changes with Zn content. The measurement ofresistances indicates that a metal-semiconductor transition occurs atcertain x for Co dopant but not found for Zn dopant. The hole carrierconcentration reduces with Co content monotoneously but varies nonmonotoneouslywith Zn content, giving a maximum at about x = 0.15. The concepts oflocalization and acceptor are used to explain these phenomena. The suppressionof T/sub c/ for both systems is discussed with various possible suppressionmechanisms.</TEXT></DOC>
