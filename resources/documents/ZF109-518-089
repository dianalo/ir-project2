 It makes it a PCin disguise.andP;  But not everyone will be able to tell the difference, and manyof those who can tell won't care.andP;  Considere the first-time buyer who walksinto a store and sees two machines.andP;  On both screens are windows and icons.andO;Both machines use mice.andP;  And both are running more than one program at atime.andP;  But only one of the computers has a color screen, and it's cheaper by$1,000 or more.andP;  And that one isn't the Apple.andP;  So, what should our friendsin Cupertino do?andM;In ancient times, back in 1984 when the Macintosh was introduced, a graphicalenvironment was a big deal.andP;  Anyone could see the difference.andP;  And it foreverchanged the computer world.andP;  Next month, however, Microsoft is expected tointroduce a version of its Windows shell program that finally will provideother personal computers with a close approximation of the look and feel of aMacintosh.andM;You remember Windows 3.0, the rpoduct that Microsoft isn't talking about buthas managed to get everyone else talking about.andP;  Now, some people will tellyou that this new Windows release is but the reinvention of a technology thatMicrosoft has been trying for five years to get right.andP;  That's true.andP;  As aninterface, it also falls short of the Mac in several ways.andP;  However, the factremains that this secret software that so many people seem familiar with isquite good and, as a result of it, the PC world be able to position itself asequivalent to the Mac: &quot;They got widnoes, we got windows; they got mice, wegot mice...andP;  Not only that, we got color, we're cheaper, and we let you runall those DOS programs you brought.&quot;andP;  Apple, as a consequence, is forced todifferentiate itself on the basis of less obvious advantages.andP;  Should it failto do so, Apple might not only not gain market share after Windows 3.0 but itmight actually lose share.andM;To date, there's little evidence that the company is picking up thechallenge.andP;  We believe, however, that it can, and hope that new Apple chiefoperating officer Mike Spindler responds with changes in the company'spricing, products, and marketing.andP;  In our tradition of offering advicewithout being asked, we happen to have a few such changes to recommend.andP;  Forconvenience, we'll talk about marketing here, and devote separate spaces tothoughts about the intertwined issues of pricing and product.andM;Marketing is one of the most common subjects for complaints about Apple,which is ironic for a company headed by a marketing man.andP;  One group ofresellers we know recently sat down for a presentation on the &quot;AppleAdvantage&quot; theme that the company has been using lately and hooted the poorpresenter out of the room after his first slide.andM;To these resellers -- and to many others, we believe -- it's no longer enoughto be &quot;friendly&quot; and &quot;fun to use,&quot; and the other benefits that Applesometimes promotes, such as ease of installation, seem like minutiae.andP;  Whatthese people would like to see is a strong marketing campaign built aroundsuch areas of Apple strength as networking and applications.andP;  We, too, aredisturbed by Apple's marketing.andP;  In our view, here's what the company coulddo:andM;* Get the story straight.andP;  For some time, Apple's marketing message has beenmuddled and rapidly changing.andP;  Apple has been moving for a couple of yearsnow to push the marketing burden out to the regional operations groups, andthe recent shrikage of U.S.andP;  corporate marketing had the effect of puttingmore people into the field.andP;  That's all well and good, but the corporatemessage has lacked the focus and urgency that it had a few years ago, whenthe company was in trouble and everybody recognized the need to unite behinda message that easily distinguished the Mac from its competitors.andM;The big campaign on desktop media that started last summer, for example,wasn't much help in the Midwest and South, where design and media accountsare less important than on the coasts.andP;  Apple president John Sculley used hiskeynote address at the recent MacWorld Expo to promote multimedia, whichindeed was the star of this otherwise lackluster trade show but still lookslike a niche to the mainstream Mac community.andM;In the recent past, Apple advertising stressed technical specifications.andO;That, we presume, was for the benefit of the MIS manager in corporateaccounts who was working from a check list of required features.andP;  Fine.andP;  Butspecs don't matter that much in such markets as small business.andM;Apple needs to figure out what its advantages really are, and then stick tothe story.andM;* Downplay the Karma.andP;  Emphasize the practical benefits of owing a Mac, anddwell less on the Mac experience.andP;  This isn't really Coke versus Pepsi wherethe products are all but identical and differences are matters of taste.andO;Between computer brands, differences are real and Apple doesn't do enough tohighlight them.andM;* Boaden the &quot;ease of use&quot; idea.andP;  A personal computer running Windows 3.0 maybe as easy to use as a Macintosh -- once you get it running.andP;  Windows 3.0,however, won't make PCs as easy to set up or to connect to printers ornetworks as a Macintosh.andP;  This is not a subtle idea we're talking about here.andO;Showing a video clip of side-by-side installations or setups on the Mac andthe PC gets the point across in a few seconds.andM;* Use the transition time.andP;  Buyers will only be able to take full advantageof Windows with those programs that are clean and use the additional memoryin the proper way.andM;The introduction of Windows 3.0 is only one milestone on a lengthy route thatthe industry has been traveling for years.andP;  Since the introduction of theoriginal Mac in 1984, an increasing number of computers have been introducedwith windowing systems, iconic interfaces, and pointing devices.andP;  Windows 3.0may change the way in which computer systems distinguish themselves, but itneedn't mean an end to distinctions.andP;  Remember, buyers believed thatimportant differences existed among brands of automobile, even after allbrands had automatic transmissions, fuel imjectors, or whatever the latesttechnology happened to be.andM;* Stress Windows' shortcomings.andP;  Underneath all the fine new address ofWindows, users still must deal with DOS and it awkward file conventions andmemory restrictions, but we don't expect Microsoft to talk much about that inits advertising.andP;  So Apple should.andP;  Once it's running, Windows helps the usercircumvent DOS, but programmers still must deal with extended or expandedmemory schemes, segment registers, and modes.andP;  Windows doesn't make life thatmuch easier for the programmer.andM;* Point up the aggravations of DOS.andP;  The Macintosh is not only easier to use,it's easier to get working.andP;  Now, those who are employed by largecorporations and have the luxury of a technical factotum or two can forgetabout all this.andP;  But anyone who has to do his own installations and setupswill have to be concerned with incredibly tedious details, such as DIP switchand mode settings.andP;  Not to mention memory configurations and interface carddriver configurations and AUTOEXE.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files.andM;To give an example from our small business, we recently upgraded our TOPSnetwork.andP;  The Macs required one disk each; the DOS machines, seven.andP;  Upgradeinstructions in the Mac manual were contained on two pages; the process tookfive minutes.andP;  Before doing the DOS upgrade, two 19-page manuals had to beread; the DOS upgrade took 45 minutes.andP;  Says our staff member who did thejob, special projects director Claudia O'Neill, &quot;DOS is enough to make mecrawl under the desk and suck my thumb.&quot;andM;There's a philosophical difference at work here that Apple should be drawingattention to.andP;  Of course, computers can imitate each other.andP;  Many shells areavailable that hide DOS from the user, and we expect to see the advent ofwhat we'll call Windows Machines, personal computers that bypass the DOSprompt and interact with the user solely through Windows from the moment theyare turned on.andP;  Similarly, Apple and others make available such utilities asResEdit that enable experienced users to redesign the Mac interface to suitthemselves and to make modifications in its operation that are very bit asfundamental as those that can be done on a DOS machine.andM;The Macintosh operating environment, however, presumes that customers beginas novices and that, although they may become experts with an interest in thetechnical details of computers, most of the time they would prefer not tohave to think about those details.andP;  By contrast, DOS presumes that most usersare willing to master at least a moderate degree of technical trivia beforebeing able to do anything of significance with the machine and that thesurest path for anyone who wants computers that are easier to use is to learnmore about computers.andM;Could Apple say something like: &quot;Given a choice, most people would rather usea Mac.andP;  Too bad more people aren't given a choice.andP;  They work in companieswhere someone else decides what brand of computer everyone will use.&quot;andP;  Inretrospect, that infamous &quot;1984&quot; commercial made some valid points.andM;* Focus on extensibility.andP;  Apple will be the only company with a consistentinterface across its entire product line -- well, almost.andP;  There's still thesmall problem of the Apple II.andP;  And the fact that, although the Mac Plus willrun the new operating system it won't run it well, even with two megabytes ofmain memory.andP;  Take two steps to resolve this confict in favor of consistency.andO;First, and the easier of the two, eliminate the Mac Plus so that all Macofferings (as delivered from the factory) will run System 7.0.andP;  Secondly,devise a way in which Macs can run Apple II software.andM;Also, most Mac applications will work under 7.0 with only minor changes, asopposed to the complete rewrite required for Windows.andP;  Another reason forapplication richness that Apple should be stressing.andM;* Rewrite the rules of the game.andP;  Apple could draw attention away from thecost of purchase and toward the cost of ownership, where Apple's advantageslies.andP;  Although we believe Apple's pricing at the low end must be closer tothe competition's, Apple shouldn't try to compete on the price of the systemby itself, because at least in some markets, whatever a customer may serve inhardware costs is likely to be minimal in comparison to what must be spent onsoftware and training.andM;* If you get it, flaunt it.andP;  We expect microsoft and IBM to portray Apple'sforthcoming System 7.0 as a middle ground between Windows and OS/2.andP;  Inresponse, Apple should potray Windows and OS/2 as more promise than product,and emphasize the benefits that System 7.0 can deliver today.andP;  To do so,Apple has to restore the enthusiasm of the developer community -- waningbecause of the slowdown in unit shipments and lack of excitement at the entrylevel -- and pull them tegether on applications that use the power of AppleEvents and Inter Application Communications to produce workgroup and networkexcitement.andP;  The hope is that Apple's traditional hard line on conformity tothe Mac standard will pay off with more applications that play togethernicely than Microsoft's somewhat looser rules of the road provide.andP;  ThenApple could claim to deliver the richness of OS/2 today.andP;  That will be a hardmessage, however, to condense into 30 seconds.andP;  First Apple has to get 7.0out (June now seems to be the target for release to developers).andP;  And it mustcontain most of the goodies that Apple has been promising.andP;  No fair cuttingback the features list in order to ship the system.andM;* Stress application integration.andP;  Thanks to the intolerance of the Applereligion, Macintosh applications work together more closely than Windowsapplications are ever likely to do.andP;  In this regard, Apple should get theword out that mice and icons aren't all that set the Mac apart.andP;  Microsoft,however, can minimize this advantage through special promotions on itssoftware.andP;  The message: If you want all your programs under Windows to worktogether wel, buy then all from Microsoft, which designed them with that goalin mind.andM;* Court developers.andP;  Recognize that the snazzy new programs are no longeronly on the Mac.andP;  Witness multimedia, which Apple has extensively promoted.andO;Microsoft is spending $10 million a year on multimedia issues, and IBM may bespending more.andP;  At MacExpo, Macromind gave a breakfast demo of Director on aCompaq 386 under Windows 3.0 which looked pretty good.andP;  Macromind's goal isparity on 16 MHz Macs and PCs.andM;We expect most of the major publishers of Macingosh software to make productsavailable for Windows.andP;  That is not, of course, much of a prediction because,at an estimated $155 million in annual Macintosh software sales, Microsoftitself is the largest single vendor of Mac applications.andP;  The Number Twopublisher of Mac software, Claris, will surely begin developing for Windowsonce it has sold its shares to the public.andP;  Most of the other major Macpublishers already have DOS products, many of which are moving or have movedto Windows.andM;Apple can't stop the migration of its developers, but it can keep theirprimary allegiance if it acts quickly.andM;Price Competition: What's really walking out the door?andM;Apple has said that cutting prices on its products deosn't raise demand, andwe believe it.andP;  Apple customers aren't asking for a better deal onyesterday's machines.andP;  They want value; they want excitement.andP;  Lately, theythink, Apple hasn't been offering either.andM;One way to understand the issues is to look at pricing trends for entry-levelMacintosh systems.andP;  For several years, prices were consistently about $2,000.andO;Recently, however, entry-level prices have gone up a lot.andM;Sure, Apple has been putting a suggested retail price of only $1,800 on theMac Plus, which has resulted in actual prices of about $1,400.andP;  And, yes,there was a special promotion last Christmas in which the Plus could be hadfor only $999.andP;  But these prices don't represent the true minimum system.andO;Does anyone walk out of a computer store these days with a single-floppy,one-megabyte Plus?andP;  Nobody we know.andP;  What Macintosh customers are actuallybuying now are SEs and SE/30s, with hard disks and often more than a megabyteof memory.andP;  That's the minimum usable system, and Apple's product line shouldreflect that fact.andP;  In other words, customers want performance approaching anSE/30, but want it for the price of today's Mac Plus.andP;  So Apple should figureout a way to give it to them.andP;  Our suggestion isn't to reduce prices at thelaw end but, through redesign and manufacturing efficiencies, to create newproducts that would supplant both the Plus and the SE.andP;  In our view, Appleshould no longer be selling systems without at least two megabytes of memoryand a hard drive.andP;  The one exception would be systems designed for use solelyon networks.andP;  These systems would nave to be bootable from the networkserver, which Macs at present aren't.andM;We think Apple could take such steps and still retain its lofty profitmargins.andP;  Most of what's required is reducing manufacturing costs throughfurther circuit integration.andP;  Surely that's what Apple must be doing withthat Cray supercomputer.andP;  In addition, at the highe end, Apple should leavewell enough alone.andP;  Its Mac llfx is very competitive and should be popular.andM;Overall, for comparable peformance, Apple should be able to charge comparableprices at the low end as it does at the high end against other well-known,branded systems, such as those from IBM and Compaq.andP;  If it does its marketingright, it can charge more.andP;  We aren't recommending that Apple compete withsecond-tier brands or the PC clones -- and it doesn't have any clones of itsown to worry about.andM;Apple Polishing: Possible product improvementsandM;Herewith, some steps we think Apple should take in systems and software.andM;* Install System 7.0 at the factory.andP;  If the entire Macintosh product linecan be revised so that all new Macs run the same operating system, then allnew Macs should be shipped with that operating system already resident on aformated hard drive, which would increase Apple's ease-of-use edge over thecompetition.andP;  No manual to read.andP;  No disks to fumble with.andP;  Get going in justthree steps: Open the box, plug in the Mac and turn it on.andM;* Give the schools color.andP;  Windows is heading for the education market withinexpensive 286-based color systems that outclass Apple's IIgs and are on theorder of 40% less expensive than a monochrome Macintosh.andP;  Thre real threathere depends on how quickly developers write educational applications thattake advantage of Windows, which gives Apple time to respond with a lessexpensive, modular color Macintosh.andM;* Give the schools somewhere to go.andP;  Apple should find a way for educators toprotect their investment in software for the Apple II family.andM;Emulation is one possibility.andP;  Given that even the Mac Plus runs faster thanthe Apple II or the Apple IIgs, and that the IIgs and Macs now have floppydrives in common, it ought to be practical to emulate an Apple II on a Macwiht little performance penalty, if any.andP;  Or perhaps Apple could developsomething like a translator or cross-compiler that could be fed Apple IIprograms and produce native-mode 68000 code.andP;  After all, the 6502 inside theApple II and the 68000 in the Mac are both descended from the Motorola 6800,and the instructions aren't that dissimilar.andM;If we're wrong on this, another approach is suggested by consumerelectronics.andP;  We note that such dinky digital doodads as the Sharp Wizardhave as much processor power and memory as our first Apple II, purchased morethan a decade ago, and sell for about a tenth of the price -- on the order of$250.andP;  Why couldn't Apple do something similar, reducing all of an Apple IIexcept for the disk drive and video circuits to a card that could be pluggedinto a Mac?andM;Whatever option it selects.andP;  Apple should make it clear that the companywon't abandon the schools when the Apple II finally is allowed to die.andP;  IfApple fails to provide an inexpensive path to the Mac, it gradually will losethe schools to IBM and Tandy, and that loss will cost Apple more thanproviding the upgrade.andM;* Give the interface a face-lift.andP;  The Mac look and feel has been with us sixyears now.andP;  Why not spiff it up?andP;  NeXT did.andM;* Do a laptop.andP;  At the least, redo the Macintosh Portable, which was amistake.andP;  It's so big and heavy that it seems two years behind thecompetition, although it's ahead in some ways.andP;  The principal error was thescreen.andP;  It's too dim and should have been backlit.andP;  (Even in the presentcase, there's space enough for lighting behind the screen.)andP;  If backlightingis too much drain on batteries, the simple solution is to provide a controlpanel option that permits a user to balance contrast and brightness againstthe time between recharges.andM;* Consider servers.andP;  Apple is telling the world that its new Mac IIfx is agreat graphics machine.andP;  It is, indeed.andP;  The fx, however, also could beconfigured as the center of a great office network -- the equivalent of theCompaq SystemPro but without the effort Compaq has to go through to traindealers to install and support it.andM;* Build and Ethernet.andP;  LocalTalk was fine in its day and still serves mostusers well.andP;  But now that network computing has become part of theconventional wisdom, Apple could add to its connectivity advantange overother personal systems by incorporating another, higher speed networking portin its more powerful systems -- if it can be made easy to use.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
