County Judge Morton Perry cleared Officer Efrain Grillo after atwo-day fact-finding inquest used in investigations of policeofficers.   ``I am on the record here and now as saying this officer usedpoor judgment,'' Perry said. ``If there are many more like himaround, I'd be very concerned.''   Grillo is currently relieved of duty for allegedly fondling aprostitute in September in an unrelated incident.   On Thursday, Perry said there was insufficient evidence todisprove Grillo's account of the shooting of Larry Davis, a homelessman who earned small change by washing car windows in traffic.   Grillo, who had arrested Davis earlier in the day but found himback at the same window-washing spot later, said the two argued andDavis lunged at him with a knife.   One witness, Turner Williams, who also washes windows, claimedthe knife belonged to Grillo, not Davis.</TEXT></DOC>
