You need someone who is alert,'' Jacksontold about 700 people at a shipyard labor rally.   ``When I become president, you workers will have a friend in theWhite House.''   The rally in a parking lot across from Todd Pacific Shipyardbegan an hour late, after a speaker announced from the podium thatthe delay was due to Jackson being hospitalized in San Franciscowith a stomach ailment.   Rick Roberts, his local campaign spokesman, also confirmed thehospitalization report, but Jackson immediately denied it when hetook the platform at noon.   ``Let me set the record straight. This morning in San Francisco,we sat on the runway for nearly an hour and it threw our planelate,'' Jackson said.   ``There was some rumor about my health. My health is fantastic.Ain't nothing wrong with me; feel so good, I want to jump off thestage. Feel so fine,'' he said.   ``He was not hospitalized. That's not true. He was late becausewe couldn't get off the tarmac,'' said national Jackson campaignspokeswoman Delmarie Cobb.   Cobb said somehow there was miscommunication between SanFrancisco and Los Angeles, and the report of hospitalization shouldnot have been announced.   She said Jackson had received no medical attention in SanFrancisco and did not know how the report originated or how why itwas announced.   ``We don't know the genesis of it all,'' Cobb said.``Apparently, from what I heard, someone stood up on the stage andsaid that.''   Cobb said she learned of the announcement when she was met by arush of reporters when she arrived with Jackson. After eatingdinner in Oakland Friday night, Jackson and the staff returned totheir hotel, she said.   ``We were up bright and early this morning and nothing happenedin between,'' she said.   At San Francisco General Hospital, a nursing supervisor whorefused to identify herself said Saturday that a man named JesseJackson was admitted to the hospital Friday evening, but it was notthe candidate.   ``It's not the presidential candidate. He is not here and hasnever been here. Our poor gentleman just happens to have the samename,'' the nursing supervisor said, refusing to release additionaldetails.   Parents hoisted children on their shoulders to see Jackson, andthere was enthusiasm despite the smaller-than-expected turnout.Organizers had predicted that thousands would attend the rally.   ``I wish there would have been more people,'' said E.J. March,36, a 10-year veteran of Todd. ``He's always supported labor, andwe've never had anyone who's supported labor.''   According to speakers and flyers handed out at the rally, theworkforce at Todd has decreased from 5,000 to 900 in less thanthree years, mainly due to business going to cheaper yards overseas.   In the afternoon, Jackson appeared at a rally of 1,500 homecareworkers at the Los Angeles Trade Technical College.   The mostly minority and female crowd of workers who care forelderly and disabled people in their homes yelled ``Jesse, Jesse''and clapped their hands as Jackson told them he identified withthem.   ``I stand with working people,'' Jackson said. ``At the plantgate, I stand with you. At the bus stop, I stand with you. In thekitchen, I stand with you. At the hotel, I stand with you. Pushingother people's babies down the street, trying to make a living, Istand with you. Raising other people's children; can't raise yourown, I stand with you.''</TEXT></DOC>
