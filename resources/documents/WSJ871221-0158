Harris Jr.Staff Reporter of The Wall Street Journal</HL><DD> 12/21/87</DD><SO> WALL STREET JOURNAL (J)</SO><IN> ILFC BAAEROSPACE (ARO) </IN><DATELINE> BEVERLY HILLS, Calif.  </DATELINE><TEXT>   International Lease Finance Corp. said it will complete soon a $500 million agreement to buy a total of 13 Boeing Co. 737, 757 and 767 jetliners.    The purchases, expected to be completed before year's end, would raise the total of 1987 commercial orders for Boeing, the Seattle-based aerospace giant, above last year's record $19.2 billion. Boeing last week announced a $2 billion sale to Air France that brought total aircraft orders so far this year to 347, valued at a total of $18.9 billion.    Steven Udvar-Hazy, president of International Lease, an aircraft leasing concern, said its Boeing order would consist of six 737-300s, five 757s and two 767s.    International Lease also said it sold an older 727-200 aircaft for $10.3 million, and leased on a multiyear basis a Boeing 737-300 and two McDonnell Douglas Corp. MD-83 jetliners for a total of $51 million.    International Lease said that it already had signed up customers for the 13 Boeing aircraft, and that the airlines to receive the planes will be announced later. The leasing company didn't indicate when the planes in its latest Boeing order would be delivered.    A Boeing spokesman, who said only that final discussions with International Lease still are being held, said completion of the order would result in a record year in commercial orders.    Boeing, which still could announce further orders before the end of the month, so far this year has shown an increase in jetliner purchases, despite a smaller number of its high-priced 747 jumbo jets being ordered this year. Last year, Boeing took orders for 83 of the four-engine 747s, selling for as much as $125 million. This year 747 orders have totaled 67.    In New York Stock Exchange composite trading Friday, Boeing shares closed at $37.875, up $1.625. </TEXT></DOC>
