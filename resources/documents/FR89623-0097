Reasons for Final Finding of No Significant Impact</ITAG>An environmental assessment of the well-field restoration was preparedby the staff at the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) and issuedby the Commission's Uranium Recovery Field Office, Region IV. The environmentalassessment performed by the Commission's staff indicated that the groundwater had been successfully restored. Soil sampling at the site has shownthat no radiological release took place during the operation. The followingdocuments were used in assessing the environmental impacts at the site:andbullet; Environmental and operational information submitted by the licenseeto the NRC during the operation of the research and development facility;andbullet; Discussions and written correspondence with the Wyoming Departmentof Environmental Quality; andandbullet; Information derived from professional papers, journals and textbooks;U.S. NRC regulations and regulatory guides; Federal, State and local agencies;and independent consultants.Based on the review of these documents, the Commission has determined thatno significant impact will result from the proposed action.The following statements support the final finding of no significant impactand summarize the conclusions resulting from the environmental studies.A. Site reclamation and decontamination will be incorporated as a requirementin Malapai Resources Company's commercial solution mining license, whichhas been amended to cover the site. B. The ground-water quality at the site has been restored to required concentrations.However, future mining plans associated with the commercial operation ofthe Christensen Ranch Satellite facility will mine through the restoredwell fields. Therefore, Malapai Resources will be required to seek regulatoryapproval of the proposed activities.In accordance with 10 CFR Part 51.33(a), the Director, Uranium RecoveryField Office, made the determination to issue a final finding of no significantimpact in the Federal Register. Concurrent with this finding and in accordancewith NRC regulations, Source Material License SUA-1337 will be terminated.This finding, together with the environmental assessment of ground-waterrestoration, is available for public inspection and copying at the Commission'sUranium Recovery Field Office at 730 Simms Street, Golden, Clorado, andat the Commission's Public Document Room at 2120 L Street, NW., Washington,DC.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated at Denver, Colorado, this 13th day of June 1989.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="21">For the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Edward F.
