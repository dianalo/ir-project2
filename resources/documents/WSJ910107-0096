Yields now average 7.65%. That's down about three-quartersof a percentage point from the year-ago yield on money funds,those cash-like investments that hold very short-term debtinstruments. Yet the funds' assets are up more than $50billion from a year earlier.</LP><TEXT>   Yields could tumble another three-quarters of a percentagepoint in 1991 in response to falling short-term interestrates, says Jacob Dreyer, chief economist for the InvestmentCompany Institute, a mutual funds trade group. But hepredicts that assets will rise at least as much as they didlast year, because money funds will still compare favorablywith other investments.   Money funds were among the top performers in the lastyear. The estimated average 7.82% yield on taxable moneyfunds for the year sure beats the 3.1% decline in theStandard andamp; Poor's 500-stock index.   In the past two years, average yields on taxable fundshave fallen more than a full percentage point, and assetshave surged about $150 billion. About a quarter of Americanhouseholds now own money funds and the assets of taxablefunds alone total $422 billion, according to the latestfigures from the Investment Company Institute.   &quot;Ever since the end of 1987, there's been a segment ofinvestors who aren't willing to put any principal at risk,&quot;says Neal Litvack, vice president for marketing of FidelityInvestments, the Boston-based mutual fund giant. &quot;Thosepeople will continue to be money-market investors.&quot; Mr.Litvack estimates that Fidelity's consumer money-fund assets,currently about $25 billion, will rise 20% to 25% this year,compared with a 30% increase in 1990.   The biggest percentage growth this year, as it was in1990, is expected to be in funds that invest only in Treasurybills. &quot;I wouldn't be surprised to see {assets of}Treasury-only funds double,&quot; says William E. Donoghue,publisher of IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, a Holliston,Mass., newsletter that tracks money funds.   Assets of Treasury-only funds soared by 82% in 1990, to$28.48 billion. Assets of &quot;government-only&quot; funds, whichinclude funds that invest only in Treasurys and funds thatalso buy government agency securities, jumped nearly 65% to$61.64 billion, even though they typically offer lower yieldsthan other taxable money funds. The average seven-daycompound yield for government-only funds, for instance, was7.40% in the week ended Jan. 1, compared with 7.65% for alltaxable funds, Donoghue's reported. (Compound yields assumereinvestment of dividends.)   &quot;People want a safe harbor they can count on. It sureisn't banks or savings and loans or insurance companies thesedays,&quot; Mr. Donoghue says.   Money funds generally are considered among the safestinvestments. Unlike other mutual funds, they are structuredso their share price remains constant, usually at $1, andonly the yield fluctuates. No money-fund investor has lostmoney in the last decade.   Still, commercial paper, or short-term corporate IOUs,accounts for about half the assets of taxable money funds. Inthe last two years, defaults on commercial paper held byseveral funds has forced management companies to buy thepaper from the funds to keep the share price from droppingbelow $1. Portfolio managers generally have upgraded thecredit quality of the paper they hold and the Securities andExchange Commission is considering a proposal tighteninginvestment standards for the funds.   Money funds also invest in such things as bankcertificates of deposit and repurchase agreements, or repos,which are essentially short-term loans collateralized bysecurities in which the borrower agrees to buy back thesecurities at a fixed price at a specific time.   Yields jumped and assets fell in the week ended Jan. 1, ina typical year-end pattern, and some funds reported unusuallyhigh yields. Issuers of many short-term securities boostrates at the end of the year in a push to raise cash. Somefunds take advantage of the highest rates on very short-termsecurities to increase their own yields. The averageseven-day compound yield of 7.65% was almost a quarter of apercentage point higher than the previous week.   Much of the drop in assets came from funds open only toinstitutions, which tend to move cash out of funds whenyields are higher on direct investments.   Yields and assets usually return to more normal levels bymid-January. &quot;We may see record inflows, especially ifsomething happens in the Middle East,&quot; says Martha Wittbrodt,editor of Donoghue's.   Growth also is expected in assets of tax-free money funds,which now total $83.5 billion, according to Donoghue's. Thenewsletter's latest average seven-day compound yield of 6.41%on tax-exempt funds, up more than half a percentage pointfrom the week before, is equivalent to a taxable yield of9.29% for someone in the 31% tax bracket.   ---               Monitoring Money-Market Funds                                                                                                          A look at consumer-oriented taxable funds and some oftheir holdings on Jan. 1 Yields assume reinvestment ofdividends.
