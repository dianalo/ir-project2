Discussion on Third World debt dominated two days of meetingsthat wrapped up Friday between finance officials of thenon-communist world's seven most powerful economies _ the UnitedStates, Japan, West Germany, Great Britain, France, Canada and Italy.   The meetings had been billed as a get-acquainted session for thenew Bush administration as it completed its second week in office.   Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady, who was host for thediscussions along with Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, saidthat a review of conditions around the world showed the globaleconomy was performing reasonably well, an opinion that was secondedby his fellow finance ministers.   Tatsuo Murayama, the new Japanese finance minister who wasattending his first Group of Seven meeting, said that he believedprospects for the world economy were brighter than they were fivemonths ago because currency fluctuations had stabilized andinflation appeared to be moderating.   Brady said that the seven countries had a ``thorough discussion''regarding Third World debt with no decisions being taken.   ``Several ideas were discussed for strengthening the agreed-onstrategy based on the same principles we consider valid,'' Bradysaid. ``Growth, economic policy changes and reforms in the debtorcountries, the continued need for external financing (by debtornations) and continued observance of the case-by-case method.''   These were all goals of the Baker plan, drafted in 1985 byBrady's predecessor, James A. Baker III. Baker, who is secretary ofstate in the Bush administration, crafted an approach to Third Worlddebt that stressed increased loans in exchange for economic reformsmade by the developing countries.   While the United States repeatedly rejected calls to forgive someof the debt, America has found itself increasingly isolated on thedebt issue as political stresses have risen in debtor countries.These nations are suffering falling living standards because of thegrowing burdens they face in servicing their huge debts.   While Brady made no mention of any modifications he would like tosee to the debt plan, other finance ministers said they believedchanges would be proposed and possibly adopted at the group's nextmeeting, in early April, when the International Monetary Fund holdsits spring meeting in Washington.   Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said the officialsexamined a number of options, including proposals made by the Frenchto create a new international fund to guarantee interest payments bythe poorer nations and a Japanese proposal to provide more money forloans.   Bush has pledged to review the American policy on Third Worlddebt, but so far the administration has not revealed anymodifications to the Baker plan that it would consider acceptable.   The meetings of the ``Group of Seven'' are generally held threeor four times a year to review economic conditions and search forways the countries can better coordinate policies to promote globalprosperity.   At present, the issues of concern are efforts to stabilizecurrencies, lower the still-huge trade imbalances which exist andprovide relief to Latin American nations straining under a heavydebt burden.   Participants said that Brady assured the other nations ofPresident Bush's commitment to lower the budget deficit, a longtimematter of concern with U.S. allies who believe America's hugeborrowing needs have deprived their economies of needed capital.   Brady said that Bush was seeking to cooperate with Congress tofind a way to reduce the U.S. budget deficit by $60 billion in thenext fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, officials said.   Participants said that finance ministers were generally pleasedwith how the effort at greater policy coordination was working,including the drive to prevent wild fluctuations in the value of thedollar. In contrast to past meetings when the U.S. greenback wasunder heavy selling pressure, the dollar at present has beenrelatively stable.</TEXT></DOC>
