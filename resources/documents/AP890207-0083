Ice covered vast parts of the Southeast and Texas, causing poweroutages, filling hotels and causing hundreds of auto accidents onglassy roads. New Orleans went ahead with its soggy Mardi Gras, butother Louisiana towns decided that this Fat Tuesday would be spentindoors.   At least 78 deaths have been blamed on the weather since Jan. 31,when frigid air broke out of Alaska.   Among the latest was a 59-year-old Chicago man found frozen todeath Monday outside a metal shop where he often sold aluminum cans,police said. In Washington state, divers found the body of a53-year-old orchard worker whose car broke through the ice inOsoyoos Lake. Two young brothers drowned in Kentucky after fallingthrough thin ice on a pond. And an 84-year-old woman died ofexposure in Dunnville, Ky., after slipping on an icy sidewalk andfalling into a ditch.   With the cold front stopped in its tracks, no immediate relief isexpected. The cold continued to plague virtually the entire nation,but especially the western third.   In Idaho, Gov. Cecil Andrus declared a state of emergency Mondayin rural Clark County, and two dozen National Guard troops helpedranchers today as they searched drifts as deep as 15 feet for buriedcattle and sheep. They also helped clear snow from streets inDubois, blocked since last week by drifts up to 8 feet.   Guardsmen used a helicopter to drop hay to stranded cattle andsheep, said Ross Mayfield, operations officer for the Idaho stateBureau of Disaster Services. ``We're talking hundreds'' of animalskilled, he said.   County Commissioner Ab Laird said he lost more than 600 sheep,700 cows and dozens of heifers and bulls on his property near Duboisin eastern Idaho.   ``They were all young cows, all pregnant, all ready to calve,''Laird said.   The Idaho Department of Fish and Game is working to save nearly500 trumpeter swans that have been unable to feed on a frozen forkof the Snake River. At least 20 of the swans have died so far. Theflock represents a quarter of the species' population in NorthAmerica.   In California, Texas and Arizona, citrus farmers fretted astemperatures dropped below freezing in usually temperate growingareas.   ``If the weather forecast is correct, we're looking at a highprobability of serious damage,'' said Ray Prewett, executivedirector of Texas Citrus Mutual, a McAllen-based growers'organizations.   Growers brought out smudge pots and turned on giant fans to keepcrop-damaging frost from settling. In California's San JoaquinValley, one grower reported temperatures dipping to 19 degreesMonday.   Today's low at 2 a.m. EST was minus 37 degrees in Craig, Colo.   More than 40 record lows were set Monday, and the record coldcontinued today in several cities. Sacramento, Calif., broke a106-year-old record with 26 degrees, and San Francisco, which hadits coldest February day ever with 31 degrees on Monday, rose to 32today, a record for the date. Colorado Springs, Colo., was 11degrees below zero. Las Vegas hit 16 degrees _ its coldest Februaryday ever _ and Winnemucca, Nev., tied its record low of minus 18.Milford, Utah, had its coldest February day ever with minus 29.Seattle-Tacoma International Airport was a record 23 degrees.   Chicago's low of minus 4 marked the first subzero readings of theyear there, and helped fill homeless shelters.   In New Mexico, a fierce snowstorm dumped so much snow at Taos SkiValley that it couldn't be measured. The resort's gauge only goes to110 inches _ just over 9 feet _ and it was lost somewhere under thesnow.   More snow fell early today over northeast New Mexico and Texas'panhandle. Snow also fell from northern New York state acrossnorthern Ohio, the upper Great Lakes, Minnesota and North Dakota.Buffalo, N.Y., had 8 inches of snow overnight.   Freezing rain continued to fall over a vast stretch of theSoutheast, where icy roads have created havoc.   ``We're on our way to a deadly Mardi Gras in terms of traffic,''said Lt. Ronnie Jones, a spokesman for the Louisiana state police.Two more people died in weather-related traffic accidents inLouisiana on Monday, bringing the state's total to six.   Although New Orleans planned to go ahead with its Mardi Grascelebrations today, parades were canceled in the little Acadiancommunities of Grand Marais and Loreauville. Temperatures were inthe upper 40s, but the wind made it feel closer to 30.   Still, bundled-up enthusiasts early today began lining St.Charles Avenue for a good spot to catch trinkets tossed from MardiGras floats.   ``We're acting like idiots,'' said Stacy Winck, 19, wearing earmuffs and a down parka. ``But it's all in the fun.''   In Arkansas, video shop owners were grateful for the dreadfulweather. ``It's amazing how many people can't get to work but cancome get movies,'' said Lisa Laffoon, manager of Look Video in NorthLittle Rock.   The weather was blamed for a 21-car pileup in Huntsville, Ala.,on Monday. In Jackson, Miss., a power outage that resulted from icywires left about 60,000 people without electricity and helped fillhotels. Mississippi Gov. Ray Mabus ordered all state offices closedtoday because of the cold.   ``The North Pole has opened its front door and is pushing thecold air straight toward us,'' said Ray Young, a National WeatherService meteorologist in Birmingham, Ala. ``The next cold air willreinforce the cold air that is already here. All of this is justsitting on top of us.''</TEXT></DOC>
