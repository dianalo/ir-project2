Thegovernment acknowledged that U.S.-backed guerrillas surround Khost,a strategic town near the Pakistan border.   Other rocket attacks around Kabul wounded five people, thegovernment said.   A government source and two witnesses said rebels captured SoreKalli, the hometown of Afghanistan's first Marxist ruler, NoorMohammad Taraki.   The guerrillas also maintained their 10-day blockade of Kabul'sfour major highways, causing food and fuel prices to rise.   Military officers of the Soviet-backed government fear thefractious rebel front has begun to unite, a government source said,quoting military officials.   Lack of unity hurt the rebels in their attempt to oust the Kabulgovernment after Soviet forces withdrew from their decade-longmilitary intervention in Afghanistan. The Soviet withdrawal wascompleted last February.   The source, speaking with the condition he not be identified,said Moslem rebels loyal to moderate Ahmad Shah Massoud and othersled by fundamentalist Gulbuddin Hekmatyar were coordinating the10-day blockade of Salang Highway, the northern route out of Kabul.   Diplomats quoted government officials as saying Massoud's menand the government were negotiating. Massoud was said to beoffering to open the road in exchange for food.   Several united guerrillas forces reportedly were fightinggovernment troops around Khost, 25 miles from the Pakistan border.   Government spokesman Mohammed Nabi Amani said rebels wereshelling Kabul from all sides.   Government sources and diplomats have reported that aKhost-bound convoy carrying weapons and food turned back towardKabul after fierce fighting outside of Gardez, which lies betweenKhost and Kabul.   Khost has relied on air shipments since January 1988.   Soldiers at Kabul's airport reported it was closed after beinghit by at least 12 rockets.   They said air shipments from the Soviet Union had dwindled toabout 10 a day from about 30.   In Kabul, the prices for flour, mutton and rice continued to goup and sugar could not be found.   More than 2,000 trucks carrying suppies for Kabul were said tobe blocked on the highway. Private truckers entering Kabul fromother roads said those routes, too, were closed to governmenttraffic.   Government officials have estimated that Kabul's food and fuelstocks would last about a month if land and air routes were cut.Silos holding 50,000 tons of flour were said to be full and thegovernment has also stockpiled gasoline.   But most of the flour would go to government employees and theirfamilies, comprising about 800,000 of Kabul's estimated 2.2 millionpeople.   A goverment source said rebels seized Sore Kalli, the hometownof Taraki, founder of the Democratic People's Party of Afghanistan.   Last week thousands of rebels attacked the city in Ghazniprovince south of Kabul. A government source and two truck driverswho said they witnessed the battle reported that by Friday theguerrillas had routed the 3,000-strong garrison.. The truck driversreported 10 rebels killed and 80 wounded. They had no informationon government casualties.   Taraki set up the garrison after he seized power in a coup inApril 1978. Althoug he was ousted and killed in another coup inSeptember 1979, the garrison remained one of the most powerful inthe province, the government source said.</TEXT></DOC>
