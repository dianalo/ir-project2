LOUIS -- Directors of Interco Inc. were delighted tohire Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella as anti-takeoverstrategists in 1988. The investment bankers were famed WallStreet warriors, and their &quot;reputation was such that you gotthem if you could,&quot; recalls Lee Liberman, an Intercodirector.   What Interco wound up getting from Wasserstein Perella andamp;Co., however, was a series of financial maneuvers and arecapitalization that did fend off a raider, but left itstaggering under $1.8 billion of debt.</LP><TEXT>   These days, Interco is hardly alone, with many companiesstruggling with the debt legacy of the leverage-happy '80s.But the story of how a conservatively run furniture and shoecompany such as Interco got into trouble helps explain why somany companies are stuck in similar binds.   In retrospect, Interco desperately needed someone in late1988 to rein in the optimism of its top executives andfee-hungry investment bankers. No one did, despite amplewarning signs. Interco turned into a case study of how badlyWall Street advice can misfire.   Now Interco has defaulted on bond payments due June 15.Its stock has sunk to fractional prices that sound likedrill-bit sizes: 5/16ths, 9/32nds. The company is talkingabout filing for bankruptcy protection against creditors. Itschief executive has quit, and Wasserstein Perella has beendropped. Cash is so scarce that Interco's new chairman brokehis predecessor's office in half with gray drywall partitionsso he could cram executives into smaller quarters and save onrent.   The story is laid out in court documents, includingInterco board minutes, financial forecasts from Interco andWasserstein Perella and the investment firm's presentationsto Interco directors, plus numerous interviews. Thedocuments, filed in Court of Chancery in Delaware, show thatthe company's fate was decided, to a remarkable degree, by afew number-crunching financial people operating with littleoversight by top officials at either Interco or WassersteinPerella. They created &quot;Project Imperial,&quot; a fantasy-landversion of what Interco assets could bring at auction, howmuch its Lane and Broyhill furniture units and its Conversesneaker and Florsheim shoe operations could earn, and howmuch debt Interco could tolerate.   Interco &quot;secured a lot of very, very bad advice from itsWall Street advisers,&quot; concludes 81-year-old Nathan Ancell,an Interco director at the time. &quot;They put a lot of wildfigures together.&quot; Another former director, Charles J.Rothschild Jr., agrees: &quot;We were given rather poor advice.&quot;   Wasserstein Perella, through a spokesman, says its advicewas based on Interco management's own budget data and seemedappropriate at the time. Yet Wasserstein Perella's financialanalysts -- including one just a year and a half out ofcollege -- spun out 10-year projections of cash flow andearnings and recommended a new capital structure, all withoutdoing much basic research.   This spring, Interco agreed to pay $18.5 million to settlea shareholders' lawsuit charging that directors had breachedtheir fiduciary duty by approving the recapitalizationinstead of letting an outside suitor buy the company.Wasserstein Perella was a co-defendant in that suit, filed inthe Delaware court, but was indemnified by Interco. Oneshareholder attorney, Robert Harwood, says he would haveliked to press for larger damages but saw little hope ofcollecting. &quot;This company has been squeezed dry like araisin,&quot; he says.   Interco's troubles started in the spring of 1988, whenHarvey Saligman, then its chief executive, feared that itmight become a takeover target. Mr. Saligman turned to Mr.Wasserstein, whom he had liked when they worked together onInterco's acquisition of Converse in 1986.   &quot;Bruce Wasserstein was brilliant,&quot; says Gene Smith,Interco's chief financial officer. But Interco executivesseldom saw him except at board meetings. Detailed work onInterco was left largely to Scott Mohr, the 34-year-old headof Wasserstein Perella's Chicago office, and to youngerpeople who worked for him.   Soon after being hired, Wasserstein Perella begancounseling Interco on ways to ward off a takeover bid thathad arrived -- via fax -- from Steven and Mitchell Rales ofWashington, D.C. The Raleses, both then in their 30s, didn'tknow much about Interco's businesses. They once dismayed ananalyst group by talking about the appeal of furniture&quot;galleria&quot; stores; the industry term is &quot;gallery.&quot; Butinvestors took them seriously because their bid was backed byDrexel Burnham Lambert Inc., then the junk-bond powerhouse.   Within two weeks of the Raleses' initial bid of $64 ashare, Messrs. Mohr and Wasserstein decided that the offerwas inadequate, that Interco was worth $68 to $80 a share, ormore. Just as they were en route to deliver that appraisal toInterco's directors, the Rales brothers raised the ante to$70 a share -- a figure Wasserstein Perella also deemedinadequate. Two weeks later, Messrs. Wasserstein and Mohrtold Interco directors the company was worth $74 to $87 ashare or more. The two investment bankers suggested thatInterco fight the Raleses with a recapitalization packagethat would spew out $1.5 billion or more of cash and junkbonds to shareholders.   Such recaps -- a short-lived fad on Wall Street -- enabledmanagements to beat junk-bond-financed raiders at their owngame, by loading up a company with debt but keeping alow-priced &quot;stub&quot; of its stock publicly traded. WassersteinPerella valued the package of cash and securities, includingthe stub, at $76 a share. Interco's board approved the planin September 1988.   Although piling up a lot of debt can wreck a company,Interco's managers and investment bankers weren't deterred,even when two corporate-debt experts concluded that thecompany couldn't handle the massive borrowing required tobeat the Rales offer, which eventually rose to $74 a share.Kohlberg Kravis Roberts andamp; Co., which sent a 17-personreconnoitering team to Interco's St. Louis headquarters, andMerrill Lynch andamp; Co. each considered a leveraged buy-out ofInterco but decided against it, the court papers show.   &quot;I don't think this company is worth anything that startswith a 7,&quot; a KKR partner, Paul Raether, says he told Mr.Wasserstein. When Mr. Wasserstein insisted that Interco wasworth more than $70 a share, Mr. Raether says he replied:&quot;Bruce, don't whip us around. Our valuation of the company isdifferent.&quot;   However, such skepticism never crept inside the 19-storyInterco Tower in St. Louis. Interco's controller, StanleyHuck, began working until midnight compiling forecasts of howmuch each division could earn. Division managers offeredtheir own estimates, but Mr. Huck decided that some were toopessimistic. He later said, in a deposition in theshareholders' suit, that he bounced some projections back todivision managers and asked for higher ones.   Mr. Huck didn't return repeated phone calls seekingcomment. An Interco spokesman says Mr. Huck &quot;is as straight aguy as you'll ever meet. He didn't do anything wrong.&quot;   At Wasserstein Perella's 41st-floor offices in downtownChicago, the investment bankers lofted Mr. Huck's optimisticprojections to new heights. Interco itself was mostcomfortable forecasting only a year or two ahead and didn'tmake any projections beyond four years. But Robert W. Medway,a Wasserstein Perella analyst just 15 months out of college,helped spin out 10-year projections on computer spreadsheets,forecasting 9.2% profit growth as far away as fiscal 1998.There wasn't a single declining year for any division. Mr.Medway declines to comment.   The biggest leap of faith by Interco and WassersteinPerella involved the company's Converse division. Theathletic-shoe business is noted for booms and busts, as mostretailers and midlevel Converse executives knew. &quot;One yearwe'd be going like crazy, and the next year everything wouldslow down,&quot; recalls Jackie Granus, a former Conversemarketing official.   But contrary to usual investment-banking practice,Wasserstein Perella didn't visit any of Converse's plants orits North Reading, Mass., headquarters or even contact itsbig customers. &quot;{Mr.} Wasserstein and others relied on thecompany's commitment that it could achieve its operatingtargets,&quot; a Wasserstein Perella spokesman says.   After a few talks in St. Louis with top Converseexecutives, Mr. Mohr and his analysts punched nonstop-growthestimates for the athletic-shoe maker into their computer.Converse executives thought they could post a record $70million of operating earnings in fiscal 1990, thanks tothen-popular items such as green canvas sneakers and Conasaurshoes for children.   The Wasserstein Perella men &quot;sprinkled holy water&quot; on theforecast, says Steve Encarnacao, a former Converse seniorvice president. &quot;No one put it under the kind of scrutinythey should have.&quot;   When Wasserstein Perella did send analysts to an Intercodivision, financial ebullience still prevailed over the viewsof experienced local managers. Wasserstein Perella initiallyvalued the Ethan Allen division at $587 million, then loweredits estimate to about $500 million after realizing that thefurniture maker's profits were deteriorating.   Even that sparked criticism. &quot;The values they put on EthanAllen were preposterous,&quot; says Mr. Ancell, the former Intercodirector and Ethan Allen chairman. &quot;We told them they werecrazy. There were loads and loads of nice young kids {fromWasserstein Perella} who didn't know much who were analyzingfigures&quot; at Ethan Allen's Danbury, Conn., headquarters, Mr.Ancell says.   Ethan Allen was eventually sold for only $388 million. AWasserstein Perella spokesman blames &quot;an unfortunatedouble-whammy&quot; -- Ethan Allen management kept lowering itsprofit forecasts while the junk-bond market's collapse madeit hard for potential acquirers to find financing.   When it came time to talk fees, Mr. Wasserstein gotpersonally involved -- and he got angry. He wanted $7.5million for five months of work by perhaps two dozen people,most of them working on Interco only part-time. That was toomuch, Mr. Saligman, Interco's chief executive, countered.Messrs. Wasserstein and Mohr got &quot;quite upset,&quot; Mr. Saligmanlater testified. Interco and Wasserstein Perella finallysettled on a $5.5 million fee.   On Nov. 16, 1988, the Rales brothers dropped out of thebidding, even though they had just won a Delaware courtruling that aided their Interco offer. &quot;They astutely decidedthat the company wasn't worth it,&quot; a former Drexel adviser tothe brothers says. &quot;Some of the operating businesses seemedsofter. And they thought the whole merger environment wasgetting worse.&quot;   Interco still had time to scuttle its high-debtrecapitalization plan, and by then alarm bells should havebeen ringing. A business downturn at Ethan Allen and the Lanefurniture business was so evident that Wasserstein Perellalowered its estimate of operating profit at the four corebusinesses for the year ending Feb. 28, 1989, by $5 million,or 3%, to $161 million. Converse's sneaker inventory waspiling up -- a worrisome sign that the green-sneaker boommight have peaked. The sneaker company soon would report acollapse in third-quarter earnings.   But Wasserstein Perella stayed bullish about Interco'sfiscal 1990 outlook. It predicted a 61% surge in operatingprofit at Interco's core businesses, thanks to $75 million ofcost reductions that supposedly wouldn't hurt sales.   Some directors later testified that they weren't aware ofany financial reason Messrs. Mohr and Wasserstein would wantthe recap to be carried out. But a confidential fee lettershows that once the Rales brothers dropped out, WassersteinPerella could collect the final two-thirds of its fee, thelast $3.7 million, only if the recap was completed.Otherwise, Wasserstein Perella would get only $1.8 million.   Mr. Wasserstein evidently wanted this contingent fee keptsecret. &quot;For cosmetic reasons, Bruce Wasserstein was veryconcerned about filing public documents with a fee of $5.5million,&quot; Mr. Saligman testified. A Wasserstein Perellaspokesman says the investment bank's judgment wasn't swayedby the fee's structure. Nevertheless, if Interco hadabandoned its recap in late November, &quot;the fee that we wouldhave received would have been less than we would have feltappropriate,&quot; Mr. Mohr later testified.   At Interco's Nov. 22, 1988, board meeting, Messrs. Mohrand Wasserstein dazzled directors with 26 pages of elaborateanalysis designed to make the recap seem feasible. Theyprojected a blizzard of statistics on a big screen in theboard room. The math was so intricate that Mr. Mohr laterreferred to some of it as &quot;optics&quot; -- Wall Street slang forfinancial wizardry. Messrs. Mohr and Wasserstein outlinedpossible gains that Interco shareholders might enjoy afterthe recap; the worst case was a 20% annual return.   Messrs. Mohr and Wasserstein did hint that theirnumber-crunching might not be based on rock-solidfoundations. A single page of their Nov. 22 presentation saidthat they had assumed that management earnings projectionswere right and that Interco could sell $1.15 billion ofassets in 18 months to repay a temporary &quot;bridge loan&quot; frombanks.   Nowhere did Wasserstein Perella acknowledge, however, thatInterco's most recent 12-month operating earnings, at $227million, fell far short of the $350 million needed annuallyto service its debt. A Wasserstein Perella spokesman saysthat risks of the recap were &quot;extensively discussed&quot; at theNov. 22 directors' meeting. Yet board minutes show that onlytwo of directors' 24 questions pertained to what might happenif Interco failed to meet its targets. Wasserstein Perelladidn't present any downside forecasts to illustrate the risksof a slump in sales.   Directors embraced the recap plan despite some misgivings.&quot;This is getting tight,&quot; Mr. Liberman testified that he tolda fellow director during a break in the Nov. 22 boardmeeting. Nevertheless, Interco management affirmed that itcould meet its earnings targets. The board unanimouslyapproved Wasserstein Perella's plan -- allowing Messrs.Wasserstein and Mohr to collect their full fee.   Mr. Saligman, who declined to be interviewed for thisarticle, had predicted in September 1988 that the asset saleswould be a snap. He called the banks' 18-month time limit a&quot;luxury,&quot; adding: &quot;We're going to start immediately. We'relooking at weeks, hopefully, to get this job done.&quot;   Instead, Interco's finances quickly started to unravel.The Ethan Allen division wasn't the only division sold forfar less than Wasserstein Perella predicted. The CentralHardware division, appraised at $312 million, brought in just$245 million. Although an eroding junk-bond market may haveheld down bids, observers say Wasserstein Perella's saleprojections would have been difficult to achieve in anythingbut the best of financial times.   Converse, meanwhile, turned into a disaster. It had fiscal1990 operating profit of $11 million, far below the predicted$70 million. Its green canvas sneakers, which management hadthought would be a big seller at $35 a pair, ended up in suchoverstock that they were dumped at flea markets for $6 apair.   The cash and junk-bond package that Wasserstein Perelladevised never approached its stated values. The package wassupposed to be worth at least $76 a share. But the closest itcame was $72.50 in February 1989. After that, its value fellsteadily, reaching as low as $42 a share this spring. Mr.Mohr's &quot;optics&quot; proved an illusion. Even some Intercomanagers dumped the recap-related junk bonds.   Interco's hard times brought a series of resignations anddismissals. Mr. Saligman quit in May 1989 and was replaced aschief executive by the former Converse chairman, RichardLoynd. Later last year, Mr. Loynd dropped Wasserstein Perellaand hired J.P. Morgan andamp; Co. to advise Interco on how tohandle its debts. For the fiscal year ended Feb. 24, Intercoreported a $48.6 million loss -- instead of the $18 millionof net income that Wasserstein Perella had predicted.   Now, Mr. Loynd is struggling to undo the damage from the1988 recapitalization. &quot;These are fine {operating}companies,&quot; Mr. Loynd insists. &quot;It's a crime if this goesinto bankruptcy.&quot;   J.P. Morgan and Mr. Loynd have devised a plan to cancelmuch of Interco's junk-bond debt and let the bondholders own70% of the company instead. Interco is circulating newprojections, including a cautious &quot;downside case,&quot; in hopesof persuading creditors to trade in their bonds instead ofpushing the company into bankruptcy proceedings orliquidation.   But some creditors, who have seen the bond prices fall asmuch as 90%, haven't forgiven a company that could stumble sosoon after taking on so much debt. &quot;Why should we believeyou?&quot; one testy bondholder asked Mr. Loynd at a meeting inNew York June 4. &quot;Your last set of projections was soinaccurate.&quot;   &quot;That's a reasonable question,&quot; Mr. Loynd gamely replied.&quot;But these projections are a lot lower. And we've spent a lotmore time on them.&quot;   ---                    INTERCO's Tale of Woe                                                                                                                           Contribution to sales                                                                                                                             1988                       1990                  $3.34 billion             $1.65 billion                                                                                                        Furniture            33%                        55% Footwear             27%                        45% Apparel manuf.       24% General retail       16%                                                                                                           Projected versus actual sales, in millions of dollars                                                                                                                               Projected             Actual                                                                                                        Ethan Allen            $550-625               $388 Central Hardware       $300-325               $245 Apparel Group          $425-475               $278 Other units            Not available          $ 61                                                                                                                                                                                                               Long-term debt (including current maturities and debenturesissued in recap) in billions of dollars                                                                                                              PRE-RECAP        POST-RECAP      LATEST AVAILABLE         $0.3             $2.5                $1.9     Feb. 29,1988      Feb. 25,1989       Feb. 24, 1990</TEXT></DOC>
