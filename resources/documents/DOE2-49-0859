<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-49-0859 </DOCNO><TEXT>The capability of fiber-optic light guides to transmit a variety of opticalsignals simultaneously has been exploited to construct an optical fibersensor for measurement of both oxygen and carbon dioxide. The oxygen-sensitivematerial (a Kieselgel-adsorbed fluorescent metal-organic complex) andthe CO{sub 2}-sensitive material (an immobilized pH indicator in a buffersolution) are entrapped in a gas-permeable polymer matrix that is attachedto the distal end of the fiber. Both indicators have the same excitationwavelength (in order to avoid energy transfer) but quite different emissionmaxima. The two emission bands can easily be separated with the helpof interference filters and give independent signals. Oxygen can continuouslybe determined in the 0-200 Torr (0-26.6 kPa) range with +/- 1 Torr accuracyand CO{sub 2} in the 0-150 Torr (0-20 kPa) range with +/- 1 Torr. Theaccuracy is higher at low partial pressure, so that the detection limitsare at {similar_to} 0.5 Torr in both cases.</TEXT></DOC>
