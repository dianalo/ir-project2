It was prepared by the Battelle Pacific NorthwestLaboratory (PNL) for Bonneville under a Related Services Agreement withthe US Department of Energy, Contract AC06-76RLO1830. Manufactured homes(commonly called mobile homes) represent a significant lost conservationresource in the region. Manufactured homes are required to meet nationalenergy standards that do not reflect the recent increases in energy prices,and the preemptive nature of the national standards prevents local jurisdictionsfrom establishing stricter requirements. Bonneville has undertaken severalprograms to analyze the efficiency of manufactured homes and encouragethe industry to produce more efficient homes and consumers to increasetheir demand for efficient units. This study constitutes one portionof Bonneville's overall strategy. 45 refs.</TEXT></DOC>
