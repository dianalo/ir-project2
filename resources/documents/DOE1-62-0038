The combustionunits examined were a circulating bed combustor, a cement kiln and asulfuric acid regeneration furnace. These units were operated in sucha way as to produce optimum as well as poor combustion conditions. Althoughthe combustion units were purposely selected to differ from one another,a number of surrogate compounds used to &quot;spike&quot; the wastes were commonto all tests (CCl/sub 4/, C/sub 6/Cl/sub 3/H/sub 3/). This procedureallowed limited comparison of the units and identification of the inducedfailure conditions which resulted in poor POHC destruction efficiency(DE) and formation of products of incomplete combustion (PICs). Thesedata, in light of recent combustion research on models of thermal destructionfailure, have provided some bases for selecting appropriate surrogatecompounds for use in evaluation of liquid injection waste incinerators.A selection of surrogates based upon a range of volatility, anticipatedPICs and difficulty of destruction as measured by several incinerabilityranking indices is recommended.</TEXT></DOC>
