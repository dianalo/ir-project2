A postulated referencerail/legal-weight truck transportation system is defined that would usecurrent transportation technology, and provide a breakdown of activitiesand time/distance/dose-rate estimates for each activity within the system.Collective doses are estimated for each of the major activities at thereactor site, in transit, and at the repository receiving facility. Annualindividual doses to the maximally exposed individuals or groups of individualsare also estimated. The dose-reduction potentials and costs are estimatedfor a total of 17 conceptual alternatives and subalternatives to thepostulated reference system. Most of the alternatives evaluated are estimatedto provide both cost and dose reductions. The major conclusion is thatthe potential exists for significant future reductions in radiation dosesto the public and workers and for reductions in costs compared to thosebased on a continuation of past practices in the US.</TEXT></DOC>
