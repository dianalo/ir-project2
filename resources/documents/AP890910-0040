The Senate Appropriations subcommittee on defense votes Tuesdayon the president's package that stresses big-ticket strategic itemssuch as Star Wars, the B-2 stealth bomber and the MX and Midgetmannuclear missiles.   Last month, the full Senate largely endorsed the president's planin passing a $305 billion defense authorization bill _ $295 billionfor the Pentagon and $10 billion for the Department of Energy. TheAppropriations subcommittee is expected to do the same.   The Senate version of the authorization bill trimmed thepresident's $4.9 billion fiscal 1990 request for the Star Warsantimissile shield by $400 million and made a modest cut of $300million in the $4.7 billion earmarked for the B-2 bomber.   The Senate also left intact Bush's request of $1.1 billion forthe rail-garrison, multiple-warhead MX and $100 million for thesingle-warhead Midgetman.   While the Appropriations subcommittee crafts its blueprint, theHouse is expected to select its conferees who will thrash out adefense authorization bill with the Senate.   The House version of authorization legislation ``pretty wellshredded George Bush's strategic programs,'' Armed Services ChairmanLes Aspin, D-Wis., said after the chamber vote.   The House bill slashed $1.8 billion from the president's StarWars request; limited production of the B-2 bomber, the bat-wingedaircraft designed to evade Soviet radar; cut $502 million from theMX budget and eliminated all funds for the Midgetman.   The House restored money for conventional programs Bush sought tokill, including the Navy's F-14D jet fighter, and the Marine Corps'V-22 Osprey, the vertical-takeoff plane.   The House later approved a spending bill that largely mirrorswhat the authorization plan does. The appropriations bill alsoslashed $2 billion from classified programs that include theadvanced tactical fighter and the advanced cruise missile.   In other congressional action this week:   _The full Senate on Tuesday considers Bush's choice of Donald P.Gregg as ambassador to South Korea, a nomination dogged by chargesGregg lied about playing a role in the Iran-Contra affair. Gregg hasrepeatedly denied under oath that he was involved in Oliver North'ssecret operation to resupply the Nicaraguan rebels while serving asnational security adviser to then-Vice President George Bush. ThreeDemocrats on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee joined nineRepublicans in recommending approval. The panel's vote was 12-7 tosend the nomination to the Senate floor.   _The Senate takes up an $11.9 billion transportation spendingbill for fiscal 1990 that includes a provision permanentlyprohibiting cigarette smoking on all domestic airline flights. Thecurrent ban on smoking aboard flights lasting two hours or less isscheduled to expire in April.   _The House on Tuesday considers a statute to ban flag burning inresponse to the Supreme Court ruling this spring that said thepractice was constitutional. That decision raised the ire oflawmakers and the Bush administration, which has pushed for aconstitutional amendment rather than a statute.   _Disputes are expected this week as the House Energy and Commerceenvironment subcommittee on Tuesday takes up Bush's plan to ridcities of smog, control poisonous chemicals and stop acid rain.Issues expected to cause disagreement include anti-pollutionrequirements for cars, who foots the bill for acid rain cleanup andhow thoroughly the government should clamp down on toxic substances.   In a speech Thursday, Bush said the House bill is ``totallyunacceptable'' and ``contains unneeded programs costing nearly $20billion from 1990 to 1994, holding our defense budget hostage toprojects that will strip money from programs crucial to strategicmodernization.''   In light of the major disparity between the House and Senatebills, and the president's complaints, a conference bill is notexpected to be hammered out until after Oct. 1, the start of thefiscal year.   Lawmakers and congressional aides have indicated that after acontentious session, the tenuous MX-Midgetman missile compromisewill likely survive while the spending level for Star Wars may bearound $3.5 billion, less than the $4 billion spent on the programin fiscal 1989.   There were few predictions on the eventual fate of the B-2 bomber.   Both the House and the Senate restored money for the V-22 Ospreydespite Bush's cancellation plans, a healthy harbinger for thetilt-rotor aircraft. The F-14D, however, faces an uphill fight.   The Senate endorsed the president's decision to kill the carrieraircraft manufactured by Grumman Aerospace Corp., of New York. TheHouse earmarked $1 billion for 24 planes over the next two years.   The F-14D's cause may have been helped by recent reports ofproblems for the advanced tactical fighter, which is considered thelate 1990s replacement for the F-14D and the Air Force's F-15.   Last week during a confirmation hearing, Sen. Sam Nunn, D-Ga.,chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, questioned thesix-month slip in the ATF and why some Air Force programs are havingdifficulty in the latter stages of development.</TEXT></DOC>
