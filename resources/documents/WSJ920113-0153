Memos and other corporate documents from 1975 to 1985depict the nation's largest breast-implant manufacturer asrushing a new silicone-gel implant to market in 1975 andfailing to do certain safety tests for years. The documentsportray the company as misleading plastic surgeons about therisk that silicone could ooze out and spread to other partsof the body. In one memo, a salesman expressed his opinionthat a decision to market a &quot;questionable lot&quot; of &quot;greasy&quot;implants &quot;has to rank right up there with the Pinto gastank.&quot;</LP><TEXT>   Before reading the documents, Dr. Kessler had been leaningtoward adopting the recommendation of an FDA advisory panelthat -- without having access to the documents -- voted inNovember for keeping silicone implants on the market. But tothe distress of many women with implants, Dr. Kessler lastMonday called for a moratorium on the sale and use ofsilicone implants. He said the FDA didn't know enough tovouch for their safety.   Last week, according to FDA officials, the agency alsosent investigators to the company's Dow Corning Wright plantin Hemlock, Mich., to start going through corporate files forany evidence that the problems and practices of the pastmight have continued into the 1990s. The investigators are toreport back before the advisory panel meets in mid-Februaryto consider, among other things, medical reports possiblylinking silicone to immune-system disorders and othercomplications. There have been no broad-based medical studieslinking silicone to such problems. Moreover, only a tinyproportion of women with implants have developed immunedisorders.   Rep. Ted Weiss, (D., N.Y.), also is pressing for a JusticeDepartment investigation. Dow Corning officials vehementlydeny any suggestion of corporate misconduct and contend thatthe internal documents are being misconstrued. On healthquestions, the documents &quot;don't even come close to beingcredible scientific evidence,&quot; says a spokeswoman for DowCorning, a joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. and CorningGlass Works.   The company's Silastic implants introduced in themid-1970s were &quot;state-of-the-art products,&quot; asserts RobertRylee, head of Dow Corning's health care businesses. &quot;We'reconfident they met the known requirements for safety andefficacy.&quot;   Dow Corning brought the implants to market in a differentregulatory environment. It wasn't until 1976 that Congressempowered the FDA to regulate medical devices, and not untillast summer were manufacturers required to submit datashowing breast implants to be safe.   The documents Dr. Kessler read were produced in a Michigancase and a recent case in which a federal jury in SanFrancisco awarded $7.3 million to a woman whose implant burstand who says she developed a malady called mixed connectivetissue disease as a result. Dow Corning says the woman hadthe disorder before receiving the implants, and it plans toappeal. The San Francisco Examiner was the first newspaper toreport on the contents of many documents from the SanFrancisco case.   In January 1975, according to court documents, Dow Corningwas in a great rush to develop a new silicone gel as well asa new line of breast implants. Two upstart companies werecapturing market share with newer fluid-gel implants that hada more natural feel. And Congress, in writing legislation,was likely to exempt medical devices already on the marketfrom safety tests.   &quot;We had a crash program,&quot; says Thomas Talcott, then amaterials engineer for the company. &quot;Dow Corning didn't havea soft-gel product on the market . . . We wanted to beat thedevice legislation so that our products would be`grandfathered.'&quot;   Top management gave a task force only five months to dotwo years of research-and-development work, according tominutes of the task force's Jan. 22 and Jan. 24, 1975,meetings. It set July of that year as the launch date for thecompany's first &quot;flo-gel&quot; product, dubbed the &quot;Silasticlow-profile round implant.&quot;   On Jan. 23, researchers began a 90-day study of flo-gel'seffects on rabbits, and subsequently began a four-week monkeystudy. But even before preliminary results were in, themarketing department began distributing samples of the newimplant to plastic surgeons for a clinical trial in humans.By Feb. 3, according to memos, surgeons were inserting it inwomen.   Over the next month, the clinical trial expanded rapidly.&quot;Eight pair of sterile mammaries are in patients,&quot; accordingto task force minutes of March 7.   By this time, the monkey study was concluded with somewhatdisconcerting results, according to memos. Injected siliconewas found to &quot;migrate,&quot; or spread, to the lymph nodes ofthree monkeys. Meanwhile, a researcher had reported findingan &quot;inflammatory reaction&quot; in rabbits, which he believed wascaused by the injection needle, rather than the gel itself.But the study was halted at 80 days. The marketing departmentwanted to have the report in time to &quot;take advantage ofregional {sales} meetings and an aesthetic {surgeons'}meeting to get word out and start taking orders,&quot; accordingto minutes of March 21.   Dow Corning's Mr. Rylee says the company's decision torush research and development was entirely justified. &quot;Itwasn't like we were starting from ground zero with brand X,&quot;he says. &quot;The purpose of the clinical {trial} was toascertain efficacy,&quot; Mr. Rylee says. &quot;The presumption ofsafety was already there because of the long history ofsilicone use in humans.&quot;   According to documents, Dow Corning's productiondepartment began churning out thousands of the new-modelimplants even before technicians had resolved a key technicalquestion: Will the new gel &quot;bleed,&quot; or leak, through therubberized shell at an excessive rate? On May 16, the taskforce contemplated reformulating the new gel. But the companyhad 10,000 pounds of flo-gel &quot;ready to go,&quot; according to themeeting minutes. And so it was decided that a memo should besent that day to the field, giving salesmen tips on how towash off &quot;oily&quot; demonstration models before calling onsurgeons.   Frank Woodside, an attorney for Dow Corning, says hedoesn't believe there was any documentation that the Silasticflo-gel model leaked excessively. &quot;I happen to think it was amarketing concern, as opposed to scientific concern,&quot; hesays. But Mr. Talcott says there was evidence of excessivebleeding at the time. &quot;I tried to warn them that the gel wastoo fluid, but I was squelched,&quot; says the Laguna Niguel,Calif., consultant, who resigned in protest.   By May 1976, there were complaints about implants slippingout of place and preventing the healing of surgical sutures,according to a salesman's report. He said a St. Petersburg,Fla., plastic surgeon &quot;postulated&quot; that &quot;greasy implants&quot;were to blame. Dow Corning's Mr. Rylee insists that thecompany would have acted on any such complaints.   In 1983, questions about the safety of Dow Corning'ssilicone gels continued to come up. &quot;To our embarrassment, wewere unable to {cite} more than tissue culture and heavymetals analyses,&quot; James Matherly, a quality control manager,said in a Sept. 23 memo. &quot;Furthermore, our product literatureon these gels imply that safety testing to qualify them asimplant materials does exist.&quot;   Mr. Matherly referred to a memo by scientist Bill Boley,who wrote that by extrapolating from 1968 research work doneby Industrial Biotest Labs and some other animal tests, &quot;itis possible to infer that our two major commercial gels forimplants are safe for long-term implant.&quot; Dow Corning's Mr.Rylee says that Mr. Matherly wasn't aware of studies beyondthe ones he cited.</TEXT></DOC>
