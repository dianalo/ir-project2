The neighborhood of 6,000 Palestinians, crowded into the oldmarketplace known as the Casbah, now has 14 ``martyrs,'' men andteen-age boys shot by Israeli soldiers along the narrow streets.   Yasmina has seen all the many sufferings and the few smalltriumphs of the ``intefadeh,'' the uprising that began on Dec. 8,1987, to demand Israel end its occupation of the West Bank and GazaStrip.   Flag-waving demonstrations, stones, firebombs and the killing ofsuspected collaborators have been common in Yasmina, Arabic for thefragrant Jasmin flower.   The Israeli response has been tear gas, gunfire, arrests, thedemolition of houses. The latest example came Dec. 2 when soldiersshot to death four men blamed for killing fellow Palestiniansaccused of collaborating with Israel.   Some Palestinians and Israelis question whether the uprising islosing its steam after two years of suffering with no realpolitical gains. But in Yasmina, the talk is of defiance, revenge,carrying on the battle for a Palestinian state.   ``We don't want the blood of our sons to go for nothing,''replied Yusra El Masri, 42, when asked if the revolt will persist.On the wall opposite hangs a blurry enlargement of a familysnapshot that shows her son, Bashar, dead at age 20.   ``He was trying to throw two firebombs,'' she saidmatter-of-factly.   Another son and a son-in-law are in jail, accused of taking partin the uprising, Mrs. El Masri said. She complained angrily ofdozens of visits by Israeli soldiers to question her other fivesons.   Pulling her youngest son, 3-year-old Fuad, close to her, Mrs.Masri said: ``I hope he will grow up and avenge the death of hisbrother.''   It's uncertain how much the defiance expressed by Mrs. Masri andothers in Yasmina is mere bravado. One former Nablus policeman,long familiar with the Casbah, was asked if residents were not worndown by the long revolt.   ``They are tired, of course, but I'm not sure they admit it evento themselves,'' he replied, asking that his name not be used.   After two years, there is reason for weariness. The Palestinianeconomy, never well-developed, has been further hurt by thethree-hour store hours and almost weekly general strikes ordered bythe PLO-backed leaders of the uprising.   By army estimate, more than 40,000 Palestinians have beenarrested and at least 8,900 injured in the uprising in the WestBank and Gaza. Palestinians say the numbers are higher.   In Nablus, with a population of about 100,000, the death tollfrom Israel is 66 in the past two years.   Throughout the West Bank and Gaza, where 1.7 million peoplelive, 625 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis. At least 154others have been slain by fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators.Forty-three Israelis also have been killed.   Scars of the violence are visible on Sharea Lulu _ Street of thePearl _ where the El Masri family lives. Near their home stands thewreckage of a house partly demolished by the army after a concreteblock was dropped from its roof last February, killing an Israelisoldier, Binyamin Meisner, 24.   An Israeli reservist who has served in Nablus said the cityholds both dangers and frustrations for soldiers.   The 29-year-old corporal, whose name could not be used underarmy regulations, said patrolling the Casbah means staying alert toevery motion atop the two- and three-story buildings.   ``At any moment, you can have rocks or bottles all over you,''he said, adding that troops also must constantly decide when theycan open fire under regulations allowing use of live ammunitiononly if a soldier's life is in danger.   ``It's a frustration. You're a soldier with a weapon,'' he said.``It's a very difficult thing. It's spur of the moment.''   Despite the many deaths in Nablus, the soldier added, ``thenumber of casualties is in line with the rules.''   Abed El Sayeh, whose 13-year-old brother died in army gunfirelast year, has an understandably different view of soldiers' rules.``Here they shoot at anything that moves,'' he said.   El Sayeh lives on Sharea Lulu, only steps from the memorial tothe ``two martyrs: his brother, Samir, and a 14-year-old neighbor,Khaled Tubeleh.   The families of both can recite a litany of deaths, injuries,arrests and humiliations at the hands of Israeli soldiers.   Abed, 21, said he has been jailed four times in the uprising.Another brother, age 11, broke his arm falling from a roof assoldiers chased him. The fiance of a 16-year-old sister, Bahia, waskilled Sept. 2 in an army raid.   Abed expects the stone-throwing and rioting to go on ``until thePalestinian state is here and the Palestinian flag is flying.'' Hehinted that guns may replace stones if the uprising fails toproduce real results.   ``We are waiting for peace,'' he said. ``If there's no solution,there are other means. ... People here would be glad if it turnedto armed struggle.''   So far, Abed said, the uprising's success has been in forgingPalestinian unity and focusing world attention on Israel'soccupation.   Israeli officials maintain, however, that Palestinian unity isoften maintained by fear.   Lt. Gen. Dan Shomron, Israel's armed forces chief of staff, saidlast week the army's task in Nablus was stopping gangs of uprisingenforcers who have been blamed for most of the deaths of 23supposed collaborators.   ``I would say our main effort is not directed against thegeneral public, but against the terror squads that are using forceand pressure on the large groups of population in order to get themout on the streets,'' he said.   A day later, a 35-year-old woman was shot to death as an allegedcollaborator in the Casbah. Nearby, a reporter encountered severalmembers of a gang called the Black Panthers, including one man witha bulky bag he said held an M-16 assault rifle.   Another man said the group was ready to expand its activities tokilling Israelis if PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat ended his order tokeep the uprising a ``revolution of stones.''   ``This is the time for punishing collaborators. When we haveorders from Arafat, we'll finish the others,'' said the man,wearing a pendant in the colors of the Palestinian flag.   Eight days after he made that threat, the man and his friendwith the bulky bag were among four Palestinians killed by soldiersoutside a barber shop in the Casbah.</TEXT></DOC>
