(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The United Auto Workers and ChryslerCorp. reached tentative agreement Wednesday on a job-protectingcontract covering 66,000 employees in 15 states.   The two-year agreement was reached after about 40 hours ofnon-stop bargaining. It would replace a three-year contract thatruns out Sept. 14.   The new pact would expire on the same date in 1990, puttingChrysler's contract in sync with the rest of the Big Threeautomakers for the first time in a decade.   Negotiators adapted to the No. 3 automaker the so-called patterncontract established last fall at Ford Motor Co. and General MotorsCorp.   The agreement will be presented Friday to the UAW's 140-membernational Chrysler council for approval before it is put to aratification vote next week.   The pattern contract protects jobs by requiring companies tokeep on the payroll workers whose jobs are eliminated for anyreason except slow sales. It also requires hiring of one worker forevery two who leave the company.   The pattern forbids plant closings except for those announcedbefore negotiations began.   In addition, the agreement includes $1,000 signing bonuses andlump-sum payments of 3 percent in 1989 and 1990, and providesprofit-sharing for the first time. Profit-sharing will follow theformula in place at Ford and GM.   The Chrysler agreement also includes the union leadership'scommitment to encourage its local unions to consider acceptingso-called Modern Operating Agreements _ Japanese-style practices inwhich workers are organized into teams.   Talks began April 18, two to three months earlier than normal,in an effort to mend three months of discord between the companyand its workers over various job security and retirement issues.   ``We achieved the full pattern settlement we set out to achieve,and we accepted no deviations from what we have in effect today atGM and Ford,'' union President Owen Bieber and Vice President MarcStepp said in a statement.   Anthony St. John, Chrysler's chief bargainer and vice presidentfor human resources, called the agreement ``affordable andequitable'' and said the bonus is ``in recognition of the UAW'scontribution to Chrysler's productivity and profits during the pastfew years.''   Unlike the GM or Ford contract, the Chrysler contract alsoincludes the company's commitment that executives will receiveneither cash nor stock bonuses in years when the profit-sharingformula produces no payout for workers.   The two sides negotiated through the weekend to settle separatebut related contracts covering about 7,000 former American MotorsCorp. workers in Wisconsin.   The national contract will cover workers left on the job after aformer AMC plant employing 5,500 in Kenosha, Wis., closes.</TEXT></DOC>
