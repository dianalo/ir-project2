The Treasury Department had refused to allow thebroadcast, claiming that ABC's agreement to pay Cuba $6.5million for exclusive rights to televise the event violatedthe law. The Treasury Department told the network it wouldallow the broadcast only if no substantial amount of moneywas paid to Cuba.</LP><TEXT>   ABC sued the Treasury Department in federal court inManhattan in December, alleging that the prohibition violatedthe network's freedom of speech and was an illegal attempt torestrict news coverage.   CBS Inc. and General Electric Co.'s National BroadcastingCo. network filed a friend-of-the-court brief supporting ABC.   Judge John Sprizzo, however, said the restrictions wereconstitutional and dismissed ABC's lawsuit. He said that inthis case constitutional concerns about free speech wereoutweighed by the executive branch's right to conduct foreignpolicy.   A. Douglas Melamed, an attorney for ABC with Wilmer,Cutler andamp; Pickering in Washington, said, &quot;While no decisionhas been made, it is likely we'll appeal.&quot;   To win rights to broadcast the sports event, which is heldin a different member nation every four years, ABC agreed topay the Pan American Sports Organization $8.7 million, withthe understanding that 75% of the money would be passed on toCuba. The network said that the Treasury Department'sproposed alternatives, which called for paying only minimaltravel expenses in Cuba, were unacceptable to the PanAmerican Sports Organization, which includes a grouprepresenting the U.S.   The judge rejected arguments that the broadcast agreementwas protected by a 1988 law adopted by Congress to exemptinformational materials from trade embargoes. The judge saidthe law's legislative history was too vague to determinewhether such agreements were protected, and he left it to theagency to interpret the law.   Floyd Abrams, an attorney for CBS and NBC in theirfriend-of-the-court brief, said the 1988 law was meant toinclude such broadcasts, and Congress's intent in passing thelaw will be an important issue if the case is appealed.   ABC also argued that the Treasury Department wasmisapplying its own regulations because the restrictionsallow newsgathering activities to proceed without priorapproval. But Judge Sprizzo said the agency has the right todecide whether the broadcast agreement fell under thecategory of news gathering.   Mr. Abrams said he was also concerned about why theTreasury Department would take a hard line against thebroadcast. &quot;At a time of cooling rhetoric around the worldand a decrease in international tensions, it is difficult tounderstand why First Amendment interests must be trumped byCold War ones,&quot; he said.</TEXT></DOC>
