This ''mean square deviation per nucleon'' has a lower bound,{sigma} /sub min/ which is reached when the uncorrelated many-body wavefunction is constructed with the natural orbitals. It is shown that inthe case of nuclear matter this minimum can be expressed in terms ofthe momentum probability distribution. In a nucleus the expression of{sigma}/sub min/ involves the occupation probabilities of the naturalorbitals. The value of {sigma}/sub min/ is evaluated in the case of variousmodels which have recently been introduced in order to study the effectof correlations on the density and momentum distributions of protonsin /sup 208/Pb. We investigate how the latter quantities are modifiedwhen previous approximations for the natural orbitals are modified byperforming either a scaling transformation or by changing the Woods-Saxonpotential from which these natural orbitals are generated. Two sets ofsingle-particle orbitals are found which yield good agreement with theexperimental values of both the charge and momentum density distributionsof /sup 208/Pb when realistic occupation probabilities are introduced;the latter correspond to a 11.6% depletion of the Fermi sea, of whichonly 3.6% arise from long range correlations as described by the randomphase approximation.</TEXT></DOC>
