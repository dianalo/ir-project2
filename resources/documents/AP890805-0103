The statement quoted an unidentified ``responsible source'' atthe party as saying:   ``Since the entity of Zionist terrorism committed the crime ofkidnapping the imam of Jibchit _ struggling Sheik Abdul Karim Obeidand his two relatives _and the ensuing repercussions and globalreactions that cornered the criminal Zionists in an impasse, thisentity has tried to cover up its terrorist act and big crime whichviolated the security and sovereignty of others and played havocwith international human ethics, values and norms.   ``So this entity launched what it called readiness to trade the(Israeli) prisoners of war and the (Western) hostages for SheikObeid and Shiite prisoners in the jails of Zionist occupation.   ``It also returned today to propagate anew that negotiationswith Hezbollah in this regard were possible.   ``We assert that Hezbollah has nothing to do at all with thehostage issue or any negotiations related to this matter. Thisissue concerns the kidnappers only. Everybody knows this by now andknows the way to them (kidnappers) if they wanted to.   ``Regarding the prisoners, any discussion is out of thequestion. The Zionist entity has to understand it has miscalculatedand that the abduction of Sheik Abdul Karim Obeid has blockedchances for a swap.   ``Therefore, the Zionist enemy should free Sheik Obeid first andnot promise itself and public opinion with what is impossible inlight of the crime it has committed.   ``We are very eager to release all the Lebanese and Palestinianmujahedeen (holy warriors) in the prisons of the Zionist enemy,irrespective of their sects and affiliations because we considerthat any prisoner with the Zionists belongs to the resistance.   ``We are as eager to obtain the release of other detainees likeNidal Zaloum, Itaf Aylan and Abdul Hadi Suleiman, who belong to theuprising heroes, and Anwar Yaseen and Soha Bishara, who belong tothe heroes of the Lebanese resistance, as much as we are eager toobtain the release of the sons of Hezbollah.   ``What the enemy is trying to leak about the beginning ofnegotiations with Hezbollah is a sheer, false and baseless rumor.It is a deceptive attempt to extricate itself from the greatimpasse in which it has fallen as a result of its latestfoolishness whose consequences it did not foresee. It is also partof a wicked plan to frustrate the morale of the strugglers of theIslamic and nationalist resistance in Lebanon as well as theintefadeh (uprising) in Palestine.   ``Hezbollah.''</TEXT></DOC>
