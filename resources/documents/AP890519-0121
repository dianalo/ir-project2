The Army said it had so far pegged last week's storm damage toalmost 200 helicopters at $585 million. Damage to buildings andother facilities was put at $15 million.   ``Detailed, exact cost repair figures are not available,'' saidLt. Col. John Chapla, an Army spokesman who provided thepreliminary estimate.   The storm, packing heavy rain and winds of 95 miles per hour,ravaged the area on May 13. Although there were no fatalities, thestorm forced 25 military families from their quarters and damagedthe helicopters and at least 20 percent of the fort's buildings.   The damage occurred even though the Army said about half thehelicopters had been placed inside hangars as the storm approachedand the remainder were tied down.   Especially hard hit was the Army's new fleet of AH-64 attackhelicopters. Fort Hood is home to the Apache Training Brigade, andthe damage forced the base to downgrade its state of aviationreadiness.   About 100 of the fort's 150 Apaches were damaged to some extent,and 30 or more were ``extensively damaged,'' according to the Army.   Each Apache, made by McDonnell Douglas Helicopter in Mesa,Ariz., costs about $13.4 million new. It is designed to replace theVietnam War-era AH-1 Cobra as the nation's premiere tank-killer andbattlefield helicopter. It can carry laser-homing Hellfire missilesor Hydra 70 rockets and has a 30mm chain gun.   While the Apache fleet was hardest hit, other choppers damagedby the storm included UH-60 Blackhawk transports, UH-1 Hueytransports, OH-58 observation copters, AH-1 Cobra attack coptersand CH-47 transports.   Chapla said the Army had no timetable for repairs, nor did itknow where the money would come from. Some discussions have beenheld on Capitol Hill about a supplemental appropriation, but thosetalks are in a very preliminary stage, Chapla said.   ``We also don't have a whole lot of experience in storm-damagerepair. We have experience in crash repairs and repairs of wardamage. Fixing all of these aircraft is not going to be a quickthing,'' he said.   The spokesman said the dollar estimates could climb since ``justdetermining everything that's wrong is going to take time.''</TEXT></DOC>
