Duane H. Cassidy, head of the U.S. TransportationCommand at Scott Air Force Base in Illinois.   If Warsaw Pact troop reductions lead to the withdrawal of someU.S. forces from Europe, those transporation needs may multiply, hesaid. Meeting that requirement is among the problems facing John G.Tower, President Bush's nominee for secretary of defense.   Senate Armed Services Committee confirmation hearings on Towerbegin Wednesday.   Officials say the United States keeps about 320,000 troops inEurope, and the plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization callfor a massive movement of forces in wartime. If NATO conventionalforces are unable to halt a Soviet-led advance across Europe, NATOwould resort to nuclear weapons, officials say.   Cassidy told reporters Tuesday that since the 1978 exercisecalled Nifty Nugget, the military has modernized its fleet of C-5and C-141 cargo airplanes and is adding a new C-17 cargo plane.   Additionally, the military and most U.S. civilian carriers andcharter commercial aircraft have agreed to transport troops tomaneuvers in Europe, the Middle East and Asia, he said.   The Pentagon also has placed supplies in areas where they mightbe needed in wartime.   In 1987, under pressure from Congress, the Pentagon created thecommand placing Air Force, Navy and Army transporation units underCassidy.   In an exercise scheduled later this year, he said, the Pentagonplans to demonstrate it can handle 46 million to 48 million tonmiles per day, the unit used to measure transporation capacity. By1998, he expects capacity to rise to 66 million ton miles a day.   To meet its goals, the command should be able to move between 75million and 125 million ton miles per day, he said.   ``If we had 125 million ton miles, I could make the (militarycommanders in chief) around the world some guarantees that I can'tmake them today,'' Cassidy told reporters.   A weaknesses in U.S. military transport is the American merchantmarine, which has shrunk over the years.   U.S. owned and operated cargo ships carry only 4 percent ofAmerica's martime commerce, said Cassidy.   ``Our industry is not playing on a level field,'' he said,arguing that other governments are building, subsidizing andoperating merchant marines that are gaining an increasing share ofthe world shipping trade.   Cassidy called on Congress, the administration and privateindustry to work to raise the volume of shipping carried on Americanvessels to 9 percent. If that is done, he said, ``I'll have enoughships to do the job.''</TEXT></DOC>
