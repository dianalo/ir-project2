Industry optimists think that just one or two fields in the area, located in the Chukchi Sea, could contain more oil than the entire Gulf of Mexico has ever produced.    However, even if a large strike is made, the extremely hostile environment would probably preclude production until the turn of the century, and only if oil prices at least double, industry officials say.    More than a dozen oil companies made bids totaling $666 million at last week's federal oil and gas lease sale for the Chukchi Sea (pronounced chuck-chee), located off the northwest coast of Alaska and near the nation's largest oil fields in Prudhoe Bay. Despite the currently uncertain oil-price outlook, the sale drew the highest number of bids ever outside of the Gulf of Mexico, with high bids totaling $478 million.    By far the most aggressive bidder was Royal Dutch/Shell Group's Shell Oil Co., which put in the high bid, in some cases with partners, on 165 of the 351 tracts that received bids. Those bids totaled $390 million. A Shell spokeswoman said company officials weren't available to discuss the company's strategy.    Texaco Inc. lodged the second-biggest total of high bids, $49 million, but had sought much more acreage than it obtained. &quot;It's probably one of the last U.S. frontiers where you've got the potential for multibillion barrel discoveries,&quot; said Clarence Cazalot, general manager of Texaco's Frontier Exploration department. &quot;It's the sort of thing where one or two discoveries can make a significant impact on your company.&quot;    Even though not a single well has been drilled in the Chukchi Sea, competition for leases was intense. Amoco Corp. bid a total of $63 million on 112 blocks, but came away as high bidder on only 23 blocks, totaling $12 million.    &quot;We were disappointed we didn't get more,&quot; said J.C. Burton, a vice president of Amoco Production Co. &quot;This is the first chance you get and the last chance you get to bid on the prime acreage.&quot;    There are few areas left in the U.S. to find sizable oil reserves, industry officials say. The Gulf of Mexico is one, though fields there are relatively small except possibly in waters so deep that technology doesn't yet exist to produce at such depths. Offshore California is another, but environmental regulations make it a high-cost area.    New areas in Alaska have great potential, though the harsh climate makes it a costly region as well, and the risks in the Chukchi Sea are high, geologists say. The companies' reserve estimates are based primarily on seismic data and extrapolations from the nearest wells onshore -- 60 to 80 miles away from the nearest potential fields.    &quot;You don't really know until you drill,&quot; Mr. Burton said. &quot;You may have a big structure indicated but it may be only half full with hydrocarbons.&quot; One of the oil industry's most spectacular dry holes, at a well called Mukluk, was drilled in Alaskan waters in 1983.    But geologists claim that the Mukluk prospect contained just one, huge geological structure in which oil might be found. The Chukchi Sea, they say, contains a number of potential sites for oil fields as well as a variety of geological &quot;traps&quot; in which oil could be found.    &quot;The beauty of the Chukchi Sea is that we have a diversity of structures,&quot; said Mr. Cazalot of Texaco. &quot;They're all basically big enough that if productive, they could stand on their own.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
