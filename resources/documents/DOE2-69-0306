The radiatively active gases in the infrared are naturallyoccurring water vapour, carbon dioxide and ozone. The effect is beingincreased by release of CO{sub 2}, N{sub 2}O, CH{sub 4} and CFC fromhuman activities. The sources of these emissions, their atmospheric concentrationsand annual increases are detailed. The complex feedback effects in theclimatic system are explained for projections of climatic change, withemphasis on the role of the oceans. The results of climatic models arein agreement for a global warming but not for regional patterns. Theglobal temperature trend, seawater/ice distribution and changes in precipitationare consistent with model results although not conclusively related tothe increased greenhouse effect. The inertia of the system means thata climatic change would continue for several decades even after the concentrationsof greenhouse gases in the atmosphere are drastically reduced. It isconcluded that climatic change might not be even but pass through a periodof instability between climatic extremes. The effect on the climate inEurope would be a cooling if the temperature gradient between the tropicsand Arctic is reduced, thereby weakening the Gulf Stream which transportswarm water to the north. 5 refs., 2 figs.</TEXT></DOC>
