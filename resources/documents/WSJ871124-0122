He had lost track of several million barrels.    In preparing his report on oil prices, the government policy adviser found that National Iranian Oil Co. consistently exported 10% more oil than Iran's treasury receipts indicated. He was then quickly pulled off his line of inquiry -- but not before discovering that proceeds from this &quot;hidden oil,&quot; perhaps $2 billion a year, were going to special &quot;discretionary&quot; accounts, of unknown purpose, in New York.    Now an international oil expert at Harvard University, Mr. Mossavar-Rahmani believes that such &quot;skimming&quot; goes on routinely in many oil-producing nations. &quot;Much more oil enters the system than is being reported,&quot; he says.    For a variety of political and other reasons, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries today is producing far more oil than it officially acknowledges. In fact, nobody, including OPEC itself, knows how much oil OPEC produces.    That's no way to run a cartel. And OPEC's phantom oil production is now causing big problems elsewhere.    Calculating the outlook for the world's most widely used commodity is a critical element of economic and political planning for nations, companies and investors everywhere. Just one series of bad production statistics renders other petroleum figures suspect, too, including estimates of inventories and demand. Thus, traders swap billions of barrels of oil, speculators trade billions of dollars in futures contracts and oil companies make huge business expenditures based partly on statistics that are likely to be erroneous.    &quot;It's daft,&quot; says M.S. Robinson, the recently retired president of Shell International Trading in London. &quot;The world's most important industry is flying blind.&quot; As a consequence, he says, &quot;we don't know whether too much oil is being produced until the market breaks&quot; and prices fall.    The uncertainty has made oil-barrel counting a growth industry. Time was when major oil companies, government intelligence agencies, trade publications and others had ready access to reliable production reports country by country. But that was before producing countries nationalized their oil industries. Now, several consulting firms have had to resort to counting tankers as they sail from Mideast oil terminals and to cultivating informants within oil-producing countries. In some future oil crisis, U.S. intelligence satellites -- capable not only of counting tankers but also of judging how low vessels are riding in the water -- may provide the most reliable measure of world oil production.    For those who try to anticipate trends in the market, nebulous production figures are a worrisome matter now. The International Energy Agency in Paris, for instance, monitors world oil supplies and demand so as to prepare industrial countries to withstand a prospective oil shock and to supervise any necessary oil-sharing arrangements. The agency has access to all of the official oil statistics in the world -- and the figures do not add up.    To make world-wide demand and stockpile figures equal production figures, the agency has to use what it calls a &quot;balancing item.&quot; The bulk of this unreported production -- which averaged 1.5 million barrels a day, or 3% of total world-wide supplies, in the third quarter -- is assumed to be afloat in tankers at sea, but no one really knows for certain.    &quot;The bigger that number gets, the more guesswork we put into it,&quot; says George Quincy Lumsden Jr., the agency's petroleum director. &quot;If it's small, I don't worry about it,&quot; he says. &quot;But when it goes over one million, I get nervous.&quot;    This major and relatively new uncertainty -- particularly noticeable since OPEC started this year's production-quota system -- is unsettling to world oil markets. When information is complete, oil prices tend to rise and fall according to the perceived level of available supplies relative to demand. When information is incomplete, traders grasp at even the smallest reliable fact. That was the case in 1986, when oil-platform cooks went on strike in the North Sea. The brief walkout interrupted an infinitesimal fraction of world oil production, yet it sent oil prices soaring.    &quot;When there isn't good information, prices tend to be more volatile,&quot; says Lawrence Goldstein, the executive vice president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation in New York. &quot;You get more blips up and down.&quot;    The blips were particularly apparent last summer. In July, with concern mounting over a potential cutoff of supplies from the tense Persian Gulf, oil prices surged on spot markets by more than $3 a barrel, to nearly $23. In response to the near-panic buying, OPEC increased production -- though by how much no one could be sure. Suddenly, in the marketplace, perceptions changed. Traders guessed that OPEC might be producing far too much oil, perhaps 20 million barrels a day, or 3.4 million barrels above OPEC's self-imposed ceiling of 16.6 million. Prices promptly skidded to near the pre-panic levels.    In their planning, oil companies are increasingly having to take such pricing volatility into account. &quot;We have learned to live with swings of $3 to $4 a barrel on prices over time because of the uncertainties on production,&quot; says Constantine Nicandros, the president of Conoco.    This uncertainty about pricing has caused oil companies to approach drilling projects more cautiously even as non-OPEC supplies are dwindling. For instance, Ray Hunt, an independent Dallas oil man who is developing fields in North Yemen, is spending exclusively on projects that would be economic with oil prices at $15 a barrel, even though he believes oil prices will remain at about $18.    The problem of counting OPEC oil barrels is of relatively recent origin. Back in the days when oil companies controlled the bulk of the world's petroleum output, production statistics were considered reasonably accurate. Even after the oil companies' foreign interests were nationalized, production figures continued to be available -- so long as demand and petroleum prices were increasing.    &quot;Until 1981 or 1982, we had a pretty good handle on production because there were relatively few players,&quot; says Thomas Burns, a Chevron Corp. economist. &quot;Since then, about one million barrels a day seem to be consumed but apparently not supplied.&quot;    Even outside OPEC, accurate tabulations of oil production are at best difficult. In the U.S., for instance, various federal and state agencies as well as oil associations track output. Yet, in September, the American Petroleum Institute's estimates of domestic production averaged 78,000 barrels a day lower than those of the U.S. Department of Energy. That difference equals nearly 1% of U.S. oil production, which, according to the API estimate, now totals about 8.2 million barrels a day.    The world's energy planners can cope with such discrepancies. And planners generally are comfortable with the production statistics put out by European nations and even by certain OPEC members, namely, Indonesia and Venezuela. Production statistics for the Soviet Union and China are considered reliable.    But for about one-third of the world's oil -- that produced by OPEC, particularly its Middle East members -- production levels are anybody's guess. Obviously, each of OPEC's 13 members knows its own production; at least, chiefs of state know. But for a variety of reasons, members keep such data secret from one another.    For warring Iraq and Iran, oil production is a military secret. It is treated as such in several other Persian Gulf countries, too. The four U.S. oil companies that operate Aramco in Saudi Arabia, for example, are prohibited from discussing the kingdom's production. In some cases, as a result, even the companies' own planning departments have to rely on outside estimates of Saudi oil output.    To confuse the issue further, the very definition of &quot;production&quot; varies from country to country. Several nations don't count oil as produced until it is sold. Thus, Kuwait can insist that it is within its production quota even though lines of loaded tankers sailing through the Persian Gulf would suggest otherwise. The United Arab Emirates exempts 150,000 barrels a day of Upper Zakum oil from its production reports because, it says, the field is being tested. That &quot;testing&quot; has been going on for years.    Saudi Arabia doesn't count some 200,000 barrels a day of &quot;war relief&quot; crude produced in the so-called Neutral Zone. The Saudis at one time produced the oil for the account of Iraq, to help finance Iraq's war against Iran. Now the oil is produced for the Saudis' own benefit, but it is still classified as war-relief crude.    OPEC concedes that production exceeds the cartel's ceiling of 16.6 million barrels a day because of certain &quot;leakage&quot; -- for instance, Iraq's refusal to accept or abide by its quota, since it is at war with Iran. But how much extra oil is OPEC producing?    People at OPEC's Vienna headquarters note that many of the production reports submitted by members are a joke. &quot;There's a lot of lying going on,&quot; one says.    Officially, the cartel puts the best face possible on the uncertainty. Analysts have &quot;various methods of estimating, guesstimating and postulating, but we have a very good idea of what we are producing,&quot; says Rilwanu Lukman, Nigeria's oil minister and the president of OPEC, &quot;and we try to give it out as faithfully as we can.&quot;    Mr. Lukman estimates that current output totals 18 million to 18.3 million barrels a day. But companies doing business with OPEC -- and planners who make it their business to follow the trends -- estimate that OPEC is producing 18.5 million to 19 million barrels.    OPEC certainly deserves credit for trying to get a grip on its numbers. It has hired outside consultants -- paying $3 million for a study by the Dutch accounting firm Klynfeld Kraayenhof -- to make on-the-spot checks of production. But many of the countries suspected of violating their quotas wouldn't cooperate.    Now, OPEC is trying to police itself. To curb overproduction, which became particularly serious last summer, a committee of three leading oil ministers riding herd on quota violations is appealing directly to heads of state of the member nations for production caution.    Some of these chief executives, including King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and President Suharto of Indonesia, are eager for new approaches to measure OPEC production because of the problems that quota cheating has created for the cartel. Although it isn't certain that all 13 nations will abide by it, OPEC is looking anew at establishing an on-site monitoring system if members agree at their Dec. 9 meeting. &quot;We are working on the idea of physically inspecting production on the spot,&quot; says Mr. Lukman, &quot;but it has political and security implications.&quot;    Although OPEC has toyed with voluntary quotas for several years, it didn't really become serious about production curbs until after last year's collapse in oil prices. Member countries continue to argue, however, over the fairness of their 1987 quotas, and each has reason to report less than it is producing. &quot;The problem,&quot; says a senior OPEC official, &quot;is that rigid quotas are incompatible with a flexible oil market.&quot;    All of this means that the rest of the world may have to accustom itself to analyzing the oil markets by other means. Says one oil economist: &quot;The only valid numbers on world oil today are prices.&quot;    ---                How Much Oil?
