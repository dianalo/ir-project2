With this battery utilizing compounds generatedbetween graphite and bromine layers (graphite used is made from vaporgrowth carbon fiber being treated at a high temperature) as electrodesand the aqueous solution of saturated bromine KBr as electrolytic solution,the electric discharge continued for more than 1,500 hours not causingpowdered layer compounds. The electromotive force of a battery with PANsystem carbon fiber (PAN-CF) graphite and nitrate electrolyte solutionwas 150mV when the cathode temperature was 88.2{sup 0}C and the anodetemperture was 0{sup 0}C. In an endurance test of a PAN-CF-nitrate batteryutilizing hot waste water as a heat source, the power has lowered tozero after 70 days of test due to the oxide nitrate corrosion on theelectrode material. The oxidation treatment of PAN-CF-graphite has causedno corrosive abrasion nor power reduction for 190 days. While this improvedLalancette battery is characterized by its maintenance-free exhaust heatrecovery unit having no moving elements, its small electromotive forceis a problem. It is only one tenth of the force required for practicaluse under the normal temperature difference of exhaust heat from hotwaste water. (10 figs, 13 refs)</TEXT></DOC>
