Loss of the exemptions would mean future contributors could notclaim tax deductions for donations to those ministries.   The IRS investigated 23 TV ministries during the last quarter of1988, the agency said in a report to Rep. J.J. Pickle, D-Texas,chairman of the House Ways and Means oversight subcommittee. Picklemade parts of the report public on Monday.   ``The service is continuing to devote significant examinationresources to media evangelist cases,'' Robert I. Brauer, assistantcommissioner for exempt organizations, said in a cover letter toPickle. He identified six of those cases as involving prominent TVevangelists.   ``We anticipate that several ... cases involving prominent mediaevangelists will move to the final stages of the examination processthis year,'' Brauer wrote. ``We also anticipate that some of thesecases will present serious issues relating to continued federalincome tax exemption.''   The report names none of the 23 ministries; privacy laws prohibitsuch disclosure. However, it is known that one of those being probedby the IRS is PTL, which is fending off the IRS and several creditsin bankruptcy court.   The report uses numbers to refer to the cases. No. 15, PTL, isunder investigation for allegedly failing to pay tax on some of itsunrelated income, including rental of part of its satellite network;for not reporting some of its income; and for allowing part of itsfunds to be used for the benefit of private individuals.   In public proceedings, the IRS has alleged that PTL paidexcessive salaries to founder Jim Bakker and some of his associates.   PTL foundered and the IRS intensified its scrutiny of TVministries after Jessica Hahn charged that Bakker associates paidher to keep quiet about allegations that she had been seduced byBakker.   Pickle, in releasing the IRS report, said the agency and oneprominent evangelist had reached agreement that led to theminister's payment of back taxes, interest and penalties totalingmore than $1 million over a four-year period. Key issues in thatcase were the minister's pay, housing and transportation.   The IRS said the cases under review also involve allegations ofpolitical activities, not fully reporting income, allowing earningsto benefit officials of the ministry, or failing to pay employmenttaxes on employees' wages.   Brauer's cover letter said two organizations connected withformer Republican presidential candidate Pat Robertson have refusedto provide records of the type that other TV ministries haveprovided voluntarily.   Because the Freedom Council and the National Freedom Institutewould not cooperate, the letter stated, the IRS had to go to federalcourt in Norfolk, Va., to seek to enforce a summons for the records.   Highlights of the report:   _Ministry No. 1 was engaged in a lifestyle that led the IRS tobelieve some income was not reported. Acting on an informant's tip,the Criminal Investigation Division prepared a case that has beenreferred to a federal grand jury.   _No. 4: IRS agents are reviewing content of TV broadcasts todetermine whether they were primarily political.   _No. 8: A team of auditors and a computer specialist areinvestigating allegations of political activities, lobbying andpersonal enrichment from ministry funds.   _No. 11: As a result of a newspaper story, the IRS is auditingthe minister's individual tax return; the minister is notcooperating.   _No. 12: A computer picked this minister's return for audit ongrounds of unsubstantiated deductions. The case was closed withpayment of $3,000 tax and penalties.   _No. 16: The IRS has completed review of the books and recordsfor this ministry for 1984 through 1986; the chief issue is whethertax-deductible contributions to the ministry flowed to the benefitof the founder and his family. Alleged political activities also arebeing reviewed.   _No. 20: The minister's personal tax return was audited; he wasalleged to have channeled church assets to personal use. The casewas closed when he reported additional taxable income.</TEXT></DOC>
