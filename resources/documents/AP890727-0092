The New Bedford ship, the Bountiful, stopped briefly thismorning off Nantucket, after the Canadian vessel broke off its140-mile pursuit and then headed in to port, officials said.   The Canadian government denied the patrol boat Cygnus permissionto fire warning shots across the Bountiful's bow after the Americanfishing vessel allegedly rammed it Wednesday afternoon, the CoastGuard said.   Coast Guard officials said they planned to board the Bountifulwhen it docked, and Petty Officer 1st Class Greg Creedon saidrepresentatives from the National Marine Fisheries Service alsowould investigate.   ``We're interested in talking with the vessel to find out whatexactly happened and collect documentation,'' he said.   The Bountiful was allegedly seven nautical miles into Canadianfishing waters, about 165 miles east of Nantucket, when it wasspotted by the Cygnus Wednesday, the Coast Guard said.   The U.S. territorial limit is 12 miles from shore.   Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Jack Mason said about 10 U.S.fishing boats have been accused of poaching in Canadian waters thisyear.   Such incidents are on the rise because fishing stocks on theU.S. side of the U.S.-Canadian fisheries line are being depletedand the Canadians are aggressively patrolling their waters, he said.   One New Bedford boat was pursued by the Canadians for 14 hoursrecently, and last year, Canadian patrols fired on another NewBedford scalloper, the Donna Lynn, after its captain refused to letofficials board. The American skipper claimed the boat was in U.S.waters.   With tensions mounting, the State Department on Monday invitedCanadian diplomats to meet in Washington next week to resolve thetense disputes between the fishermen and the patrol boats.   Petty Officer Ellen Marie Harrington said the service radioedthe Bountiful advising it to stop for its own safety, but thefishing boat did not respond.   Once inside the 12 miles, Mason said, a Coast Guard cutter would``escort'' the Bountiful to New Bedford, where it would be boardedand inspected. If the vessel were found to have been fishingillegally, it could be fined and its permit lifted.   The Canadian boat was allowed to pursue the Bountiful into the200-mile U.S. exclusive economic zone.   Mason identified the Bountiful's owner as Edward Perry of NewBedford.</TEXT></DOC>
