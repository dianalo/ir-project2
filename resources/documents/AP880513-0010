DALE NELSON</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   A presidential panel says race should not be abarrier to adoption but that homosexuals should be prevented fromadopting children.   ``It is preferable to place a child in a family of his ownracial background,'' the Interagency Task Force on Adoption said ina report made public Thursday. However, said Mary Sheila Gall, headof the 13-member panel, ``when minority homes are not available,those children should not wait for long periods.''   ``They shouldn't grow up in foster care because there isn't afamily of the same skin color for them,'' Ms. Gall said.   Ms. Gall, counselor to the director of the Office of PersonnelManagement, is a single parent of two adopted Hispanic children.   She said one organization suggested expanded rights for gay menand lesbians to adopt children, but ``we feel that the Americanpublic is not ready to give, and we are not ready to give, supportfor homosexual adoption.''   The 54-page report devoted only one sentence to the issue,saying, ``The task force does not support adoption by homosexuals.''   President Reagan appointed the task force last August. Itsreport was released after being presented to representatives ofprivate agencies at a meeting in the Oval Office.   Ms. Gall said Reagan, one of whose four children is adopted,``cited what a special way this is to build a family _ to have anadoptive child.''   Michael Reagan is the president's adopted son.   The task force said about 40 per cent of the 1 million Americanteen-agers who become pregnant each year have abortions. Of theteen-agers who give birth, it said, at least 90 per cent end upraising them.   ``A prevailing view appears to be that if a woman does not getan abortion, she must want to have a baby and take care of himherself,'' the panel said. ``The option which gives life to a baby,while offering hope to the biological parents and joy to adoptiveparents, is too often forgotten, ignored or misunderstood.''   The task force recommended that other states consider a lawadopted in California that reimburses licensed, non-profitmaternity homes for the costs of care and services necessary for awoman under 21 to carry her baby to full term.   The panel also supported pending federal legislation under whichthe adopted child of a retired or disabled worker would be treatedthe same as a biological child in determining Social Securitybenefits.   The panel included representatives from the White House, JusticeDepartment, Treasury Department, Department of Health and HumanServices, Department of Education, Department of Defense,Department of Agriculture, Department of Labor and CommodityFutures Trading Commission.</TEXT></DOC>
