Tsutomu Ohshima, Toyota executive vice president, confirmed reports that the Japanese company has discussed with GM the idea of building Toyota trucks at the New United Motor Manufacturing Inc., or Nummi, plant, the two auto makers' Fremont, Calif. joint venture. That plant currently builds cars for both companies.    Mr. Ohshima said Toyota also is considering other sites but that the Nummi plant is attractive because the West Coast accounts for most of Toyota's U.S. pickup truck sales. He added that Toyota wants to reach a decision as soon as possible, although it would need GM's permission to build trucks at Nummi.    If Toyota builds trucks at Nummi, the plant could be more profitable for both companies. The cars built at Nummi haven't sold well, and the plant has cut production several times since it began operations. But GM and other U.S. auto makers have enjoyed surging light truck sales as the rising yen and a 25% tariff have pushed up the price of Japanese trucks. GM could surrender some of its advantage by allowing Toyota to produce trucks in California. </TEXT></DOC>
