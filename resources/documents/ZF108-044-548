 Originally developed at the MassachusettsInstitute of Technology with the help of various manufacturers, X has beenadopted by every major workstation vendor as well as by more than ahalf-dozen independent terminal vendors.andM;In addition to its graphics and windowing power, X offers other advantages tosystems integrators that have to deal with heterogeneous systems andnetworks.andP;  For one, the X Window System operates independently of anyparticular operating system.andP;  As a result, you can buy--or write--Xapplications that run with any major operating system, including UNIX, DOS,OS/2 and VMS.andM;Likewise, X is hardware-independent: You can run X applications on anythingfrom a supercomputer to a personal computer to a terminal, provided it isequipped with the appropriate X code.andM;Even more important for systems integrators is the fact that the X WindowSystem is network-independent.andP;  It works with a variety of protocols, such asTCP/IP and DECnet; physical topologies, such as Ethernet and token ring; andnetwork file systems, such as RFS (Remote File System and NFS (Network FileSystem).andM;Another benefit of network transparency: The display and the applicationsdon't have to be running on the same system.andP;  Integrators can distributeapplications and displays to take advantage of different hardware platformcapabilities.andP;  Moreover, users can run multiple concurrent applications inoverlapped windows--even multiple windows per application--on a single node.andM;In effect, the X Window System opens up an entire network's resources toindividual users: You can access an application from any node on the network,even though you're not running the application on your node.andM;Digital Equipment Corp. supplies the following example: Consider anULTRIX-based workstation displaying in one window the results of a stressanalysis program for an automobile part.andP;  The analysis is coming from acompute-intensive program running on a Cray Research In.andP;  supercomputer.andP;  Asecond window might display a drawing of the part, which is being designedwith a CAD program running on a remote ULTRIX-based computer.andM;A third window displays a parts list from a database on a VAXcluster runningthe VMS operating system.andP;  A fourth window displays electronic mail.andO;Although these applications are separate entities, users could, for example,cut out text from the parts list window and paste it into a memo in thewindow running E-mail.andM;The combined advantages of the X Window system have lead to rousingaccolades.andP;  For example, Smokey Wallace, director of SQL*NET development atOracle Corp., calls X &quot;the most significant breakthrough in networking sincethe invention of Ehternet.&quot;andM;Client-server architectureandM;To understand how to fit the X Window System into your applicationsenvironment, it's necessary to comprehend the X architecture.andM;The X Window System is based on a client-server architecture.andP;  Unliketraditional client-server relationship (see &quot;Gentlemen, start your serverengines&quot;), in the X Window System the client system handles applicationmanagement tasks while the server machine takes orders from the clients.andM;If that seem confusing, consider a simple X-based environment that includes aDigital VAX minicomputer, a Sun Microsystems Inc. workstation and a TektronixInc. terminal, all equipped with X Window software.andP;  The systems are hookedup via Ethernet with TCP/IP protocols.andM;Assume that your're sitting at the workstation, and you want to displayapplication A in one of your windows.andP;  Application A is running on the VAX.andO;Let's say that the X terminal is displaying application A and application B.andM;In this simple scenario, your workstation and the terminal are X serversbecause they control physical displays; the VAX ia an X client because it isrunning a client program (application A).andP;  In effect, the client is theapplication.andM;An X terminal is always a server because it can only display programs; itcan't, er, serve programs.andP;  A workstation can be a server and/or a client.andM;Basically, there are two key components of the X Window System: X library(Xlib), a graphics subroutine library, and X Server.andP;  A client machineincludes the Xlib portion of the system.andP;  The server machine includes the XServer portion of the system code.andP;  Both the client and server must have XNetwork Protocol software.andP;  All device-dependent code is in the server; theclient part of the X code is device-independent.andM;The client and server communicate via asynchronous stream-based interprocesscommunication, whether the client software and server software are on thesame platform or on different platforms.andP;  If the client and server are ondifferent machines, the X architecture allows you to run an application onone system and display it on other systems.andP;  In fact, any X-based application(client) can display its output on any remote workstation running X Serversoftware.andM;Because X seems to reverse the standard concept of client-serverrelationships, it's difficult for even industry veterans to grasp.andP;  DavidWilliams, product manager for the X Window System at Hewlett-Packard Co.,andO;syas.andP;  &quot;X is counter-intuitive to what we've grown up with.&quot;andP;  However,Williams adds, &quot;The client-server model gives X some of its greatest power inthe development arena: You can send data anywhere and display it anywhere.&quot;andM;Xlib passes screen-display information from the host application to the XServer and passes user-input information from the X Server back to the hostapplication.andP;  The X Server translates screen-display information anduser-input information between Xlib and the workstation in which the X Servercode resides.andM;Many versions availableandM;The X Window System is available bundled with vendor-supplied platforms ordirect from the MIT X Consortium, based at the school.andP;  The consortiumdistributes X on three nine-track half-inch tapes.andP;  The code runs onplatforms from HP (including its Apollo division), Sun, Apple Computer Inc.andO;and IBM Corp.andP;  The X Window System from MIT includes all the X componentsplus rudimentary sample applications.andM;Release 4 of the X Window System (Version 11.4) was due out from MIT latelast month; it adds a variety of features to Release 3.andP;  For example, at theserver level, Release 4 &quot;uses roughly half the memory of Release 3 and ismuch faster, particularly in color,&quot; says Jim Fulton, a member of theresearch staff at MIT.andM;At the Xlib level, Release 4 now supports the interclient communicationsconventions manual (ICCCM), a set of rules that specify how windowed programson the server interact.andM;Fulton also says that Release 4 includes sample implementations of themultibuffering extension, as well as new widgets and additional fonts.andO;(Examples of widgets: pop-up menus, scroll bars, window borders and dialogboxes.)andP;  Most importantly, perhaps, Release 4 also corrects a lot of the bugsin Release 3.andM;The terminal approachandM;X runs on any level of machine.andP;  If the price of a full-blown workstationloaded with X Windows is too expensive, consider X terminals.andP;  They rangefrom under $1,000 for a basic monochrome model to around $10,000 for a fullyloaded color platform.andP;  Early entrants in the X terminal market includeDigital, Tektronix, Acer America Corp., C. Itoh Electronics Inc., GraphOnCorp., Human Designed Systems Inc., Network Computing Devices Inc. (NCD), NCRCorp., Spectragraphics Corp. (X plus IBM 3270 connectivity) and VisualTechnology Inc.andP;  Tektronix has an OEM relationship with NCD.andM;Even PCs are getting into the X act.andP;  To use a DOS-based PC as an X server,you need only buy X terminal-emulation software, which is available from ahandful of suppliers.andP;  According to Dataquest Inc., a San Jose marketresearch firm, current leaders in providing PC-based X Window support includeGraphic Software Systems (GSS), Interactive Systems Corp. and Locus ComputingCorp.andP;  Interactive's software targets 80386-based PCs, while GSS and Locusproducts run on 80386 or 80286 machines.andP;  PC-based X servers provide anobvious advantage: You can combine DOS and X applications on a relativelyinexpensive platform.andM;Dataquest predicts that X terminals will eventually face formidablecompetition from PC-based X servers.andP;  For the time being, however, Xterminals have a price-performance advantage over X-equipped PCs.andM;System connections made easyandM;Once you understand the basic architecture of the X Window System, you'reready to hook up the various workstations and terminals.andM;Here's how the X Window System achieves network independence: The Xlibportion of X--the lower layer--includes network-dependent code.andP;  Currently,that code provides support for TCP/IP and DECnet protocols.andP;  As a result, ifyou want to send data over a network using either of those protocols, youdon't have to worry about writing additional network code.andP;  Networking overTCP/IP or DECnet is also transparent to users.andM;Regarding DECnet support, MIT's Fulton explains, &quot;X currently compiles onlywith Digital's DECnet interfaces.andP;  So if you have DECnet ULTRIX, you can useX over DECnet.&quot;andP;  What if you have, say, an HP workstation with X and you wantto use DECnet protocols?andP;  &quot;If you have the DECnet libraries on the HPworkstation, you probably could convert it, if it used the socketsinterface,&quot; says Fulton.andM;Calling interfaces reside inside Xlib and the server code.andP;  Modules fornetwork protocols, such as TCP/IP and DECnet, plug in below the callinginterfaces.andP;  Clients can establish connections with any number of servers:Clients can make requests of servers via Xlib graphics library calls.andP;  Theservers, in turn, handle graphics and windowing functions (called X serverprocesses).andM;Currently, the X Window System from MIT does not include support for otherprotocols such as Systems Network Architecture or Open SystemsInterconnection (OSI).andP;  However, if you want to extend X for either of thoseprotocols, you can write additional Xlib calls.andP;  HP's Williams says thatadding support for additional network protocols is &quot;a fairly trivial task.&quot;andM;Alternatively, your platform vendor might supply support for networkprotocols other than TCP/IP and DECnet.andM;If you need X Windows as well as a window into the IBM mainframe world,consider Spectragraphics' X terminal line.andP;  The company's LanSet 800 providesfull X Windows software along with IBM 3270/3179G/3192G compatibility.andM;When market demand for additional protocol support becomes strong enough, MITwill include support for those protocols.andP;  MIT's Fulton: &quot;Clearly, a lot ofpeople are interested in OSI.andP;  Once there are OSI implementations available,you'll see OSI support in X Windows.&quot;andM;Easy application portabilityandM;Still another key advantage of the X Window System, particularly inheterogeneous environments, is its ease of applications portability.andP;  Say youwant to port an X application from an HP workstation to a Digitalworkstation.andP;  According to Williams, &quot;If you just stick to the standard Xlib,portability should be a snap: It will most likely just requirerecompilation.&quot;andM;The XT intrinsics portion of the X Window System sits on top of the Xlibcode: If your application adheres to the XT intrinsics standards, then itshould be also easy to port it between most platforms.andM;In fact, some application developers marvel at X's portability.andP;  &quot;Xapplications are very portable: It's amazing,&quot; says Tom Hite, a seniordevelopment engineer at Computer Aided Design Software Inc.andP;  CADSI used X todevelop a user interface for its Dynamic Analysis and Design System (DADS)application package--a UNIX-based dynamic-simulation package that includes asophisticated animation generator.andM;CADSI ported its X application to platforms from Digital, HP/Apollo, Sun,Tektronix and Silicon Graphics Inc.andP;  In each case, the port only requiredrecompilation, according to Hite.andM;DADS runs in networked environments using TCP/IP protocols.andP;  No additionalnetworking code is required.andP;  To develop its X-compliant user interface,CADSI used the code from MIT as well as the X code supplied with eachvendor's workstation.andM;Why did CADSI choose X?andP;  &quot;Purely for portability reasons,&quot; says Hite, adding:X being supported by a multivendor consortium was also important.andM;Some developers disagreeandM;Not all application developers agree that X applications are easy to port.andO;Here's the view of Guy Blair, engineering manager at Environmental SystemsResearch Institute Inc. (ESRI): &quot;Unfortunately, an X application does notport that easily between platforms, because each vendor does their ownimplementation based on the MIT code.andP;  For example, some have differentquality standards, some add value.&quot;andM;Blair contends that porting an X-based application from one platform toanother is far from a mere recompilation job.andP;  How long can a port take?andP;  &quot;Itreally depends,&quot; says Blair, &quot;If it's a brand new platform, it could be asix-month process [for one programmer].andP;  If it's an upgrade of our Arc-Infoon a platform we've already ported to, it's maybe three or four months.&quot;andM;ESRI developed an X-compliant graphical user interface for its Arc/Infoapplication package--a 2-D geographical-information system.andP;  Why X?andP;  &quot;Becauseit's a standard, it was the only way we could support the 18 or so platformsthat we run on,&quot; Blair explains.andM;Additionally, Blair says that when porting Arc/Info from one platform toanother, ESRI doesn't have to rewrite its X driver every time, but theidiosyncracies of each platform can cause porting problems.andP;  Usually,idiosyncracies are synonymous with bugs.andP;  In other words, the portability ofX applications depends largely on how well the platform vendor has debuggedthe MIT code.andM;Higher layers may present problemsandM;The higher layers of an X implementation may pose some porting difficulties.andO;For example, consider an application developed on an HP workstation thatconforms to the Open Software Foundation's Motif graphical user intereface,which includes components such as widgets.andP;  It should be easy to port thatapplication to another machine that conforms to the Motif standard.andP;  However,if you want to port the application to, say, an NCR machine running the OpenLook graphical user interface--which was developed by ATandamp;T and Sun and is notcompatible with Motif--you'll run into problems.andM;You'll have to rewrite user interface code, even though both Open Look andMotif are based on the X Windown System.andP;  To minimize such problems, HP'sWilliams suggests keeping the user interface part of your application code asseparate as possible from the rest of the code.andP;  That will facilitate portingbetween machines with different, incompatible user interfaces, he says.andM;Discussing a port from a Digital-Motif environment to an NCR machine runningOpen Look, Jake VanNoy, a DECWindows architect at Digital, says &quot;Either yourewrite code, or you use Motif on the NCR box, which is the way we see a lotof people going.&quot;andM;Getting a B+ gradeandM;So far, it would seem as though there are few drawbacks to the X WindowSystem.andP;  Not so.andM;Because X is designed for bitmapped, networked graphical platforms, you can'tuse it with standard character-based dumb terminals.andP;  Similarly, computersbased on anything less than an 80386 processor may be too slow--or many nothave enough memory--for some X applications.andM;In addition, X does not currently support 3-D graphics and imaging, although3-D attributes may be included in future releases or developed by independentsoftware developers.andP;  In fact, the PHIGS Extension to X (PEX) is one of the Xextensions currently in progress.andP;  Other extensions include live video,support for additional input devices, and non-rectangular windows, andimaging.andM;And vendors can add extensions on their own.andP;  Digital, for example, offersDisplay PostScript compatibility in its X-based DECwindows environment.andP;  (SeeSystems Integration, October 1989, page 58.)andM;You can, of course, run 3-D graphics applications in an X server workstationwindow, but you can't ship the graphics between servers and clients.andP;  Inother words, you can't achieve network transparency with 3-D graphics in an XWindow System environment.andM;For high-end graphics-application developers, the lack of built-in supportfor 3-D is a serious drawback.andP;  &quot;They have to come up with 3-D graphics,&quot;says CADSI's Hite, who considers lack of 3-D as the only drawback to the XWindow System, at least for his company's application.andM;To get around the problem, CADSI does 3-D by using its own hierarchicaldatabase manipulator.andP;  &quot;We need something like PHIGS--something that'sprewritten as a graphics database manipulator,&quot; says Hite, who isanticipating the arrival of PEX.andM;The only other complaint that Hite has about the X Window System is itsgraphics speed.andP;  &quot;But vendors are taking care of that,&quot; Hite says.andP;  &quot;Forexample, Tektronix binds their hardware graphics engine to X Windows in a waythat speeds up overall graphics processing.&quot;andM;Another possible drawback: It may be tough to program with X, depending onyour previous programming experience.andP;  &quot;It depends on how used to objectorientation and windowing systems you are,&quot; says Hite.andP;  &quot;If you haven'tprogrammed with windowing or message-based systems before, it's a littledifficult.andP;  [But] it was no problem for me.&quot;andM;Most X proponents will encourage you to program using the toolkit, a clientlibrary that provides subroutines for building user interfaces.andP;  The toolkitcomes with your X-based platform and interfaces to the Xlib code.andP;  Althoughyou may be able to get better performance by programming directly with theXlib, it's a difficult task.andM;However, the biggest drawback to the X Window System is a lack ofoff-the-shelf applications.andP;  As a result, it's likely that you'll have toroll your own, which can be a formidable task given the complexity of X.andM;Fortunately, now that all major vendors have embraced X, developers arerushing to write X-compliant programs.andP;  There are a few dozen available now,with more being added each month.andM;Mike Harrigan, vice president of market development at NCD, expects about1,000 X-based off-the-shelf applications to be available by the end of thisyear.andP;  In addition, Harrigan notes that a lot of companies are developing Xapplications for in-house use or for their captive customers.andM;X may not be, as Oracle's SQL*NEt chief Wallce claims, the greatest thingsince Ethernet, but for open networking it certainly has the potential toease siginificantly the systems integration burden.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
