Boster, the agency's assistant administrator for automatedinformation services, is enthusiastic about the program.andP;  &quot;This is one of themost brilliant automation training programs ever developed,&quot; Boster said.andO;&quot;This is a 200-hour development program that teaches about technology,systems analysis, development and management skills and self-awareness.andP;  Ittruly develops your life.&quot;andM;Rice said the curriculum covers seven areas on which coordinators are rated:problem solving and decision-making, perception and analytical ability,organization and planning, use and support of software packages andapplications, application of systems analysis methods and design techniques,use of project management methods, and oral and written communication.andM;Ratings range from a low rating of zero to the highest training of five.andM;During the first of three phases, the formal training phase, coordinatorsattend a week of classes five times over a period of six months.andM;The other two phases are the self-development phase, which includes carrercounseling, a mentorship program and home study, and the on-the-job-trainingphase, where coordinators undertake mobility assignments.andM;Out in the FieldandM;Rice said the OJT training phase is different because coordinators act asproject managers at a local bank for five days with no direction or advicefrom FmHA, but with complete control to manage any project they feel isnecessary.andP;  It is an experience that Rice said coordinators do not at firstlike, but that by the end they appreciate.andM;&quot;Because there is a similarity between FmHA and banks, teh mobilityassignment gives the coordinator a look at things like the guaranteed loanprogram and the relationship between what we do and what the bank does,&quot; Ricesaid.andP;  &quot;You're forced to use your time wisely.&quot;andM;Rice said coordinators in several states came up with solutions to problemsin their host banks during their mobility assignments.andP;  She said thecoordinator from Maine helped to bring on line an effective IRM programduring the five days she was on the site.andP;  The coordinator in Wyoming starteda cetralized record-keeping system used by the Wyoming secretary of state.andM;Rice said the returning-to-learning phase of the program is not for everyone.andO;Still attrition was low, she said.andP;  Of 46 coordinators, 42 completed theprogram.andP;  a poll taken of the coordinators that completed the program showedthat 36 of 42 left motivated and 30 wanted more education.andM;&quot;They have a clearer perspective on the politics and dynamics of theirposition.andP;  Many are returning to school, and we are really excited aboutthat,&quot; Rice said.andM;&quot;I'm a litte bit nervous about feeling capable of doing a big project myself,but at least I now have a better idea of how it should be done,&quot; Harris said.andM;&quot;I've started taking into account not only the program and administrativeside, but everybody's perspective.andP;  What that's done is opened up all kindsof doors, because everything that happens, especially here, has an effect onsomebody else,&quot; Pfaffenberger said.andP;  &quot;In a few cases I've been able toidentify problems that had nothing to do with automation.&quot;andO;</TEXT></DOC>
