But the reportplaces most of the burden for responding to the Japanesechallenge on the private sector.   The report shows declines in the U.S. share of worldmarkets even in such fields as personal computers,supercomputers and microprocessors, which the U.S. has longdominated. The study also notes that practically all capacityfor fabricating silicon wafers, the basic material formanufacturing semiconductors, is now in Japanese and Europeanhands.   Moreover, Japan outspends the U.S. in X-ray lithography,the most promising method for printing themultibillion-transistor memories of the future, the reportsays.   In 1987, the latest year for which reliable global-tradefigures are available, Japan already led the world inelectronic exports with shipments valued at $38 billion. TheU.S. trailed with $35 billion in exports, followed by theEuropean Community with shipments of $26 billion.   A comparison of corporate growth rates between 1983 and1987 shows Japanese electronic producers to be outpacingtheir U.S. rivals; the Japanese companies' sales grew 27.9%,compared with 10.8% for the U.S. companies.   In another indicator of how industrial strength isshifting, three Japanese companies won more U.S. electronicpatents in 1987 than any other companies -- Canon Inc.,Hitachi Ltd. and Toshiba Corp. General Electric Co. was nextand N.V. Philips of the Netherlands was No. 5.   In the past few years, the Japanese have invested heavilyin U.S. electronic capacity, partly to avoid additionalimport duties imposed on their personal computers,semiconductors and electric typewriters. Although theseJapanese-owned operations create U.S. employment, they alsocontribute to the U.S. trade deficit because the value oftheir imports of components exceeds that of their exports offinal products, the report said.</TEXT></DOC>
