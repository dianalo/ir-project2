If you add any more graphicsterminals, the system response time begins to plummet.andP;  Of course, the PC cancarry a greater load if some stations don't run graphics.andM;TWO BASIC APPROACHESandM;This review covers two basic types of systems.andP;  The first high-performancecolor graphics terminal on the market-one that uses a unique technology-comesfrom SunRiver Corp. Its stations use a bus-extension architecture thatextends the PC data bus from the host computer to the local workstation.andO;Linking host and workstation is a fiber-optic cable operating at 32 megabitsper second.andP;  The I/O circuit components themselves reside on the desktop, andsignals pass to the shared CPU over the high-speed link.andM;The second approach, favored by AMR and Viewport Technology, uses specialintegrated circuits to extend the keyboard, video, parallel, and serial portcables far beyond their normal limits.andP;  This long-cable architecture combinesall the graphics, keyboard, and serial ports of the workstation into circuitscontained on an adapter card in the host PC.andP;  The integrated signals then goout over a multiconductor copper cable to a small station controller box, oneat each desktop, with connections for a keyboard, monitor, and serial port.andO;One advantage of the fiber-optic technology is that the workstations can beup to 1,000 feet from the host.andP;  Other advantages of fiber-optic cableinclude its small size, immunity to radio-frequency (RF) interference fromfluorescent lights or AC- wiring, and high data-rate capability.andM;Its disadvantages include its minimum bend radius (usually about I inch), andits somewhat greater fragility and higher cost than coaxial cable.andP;  A100-foot fiber-optic cable costs $199 versus $147 for a 13twisted-pair cable.andO;At 250 feet, the costs are $369 for fiber-optic and $282 for the twistedpair.andM;The cables used for long-cable systems-about the diameter of a parallelprinter cable-may seem cumbersome for weaving around the nooks and cranniesof your office.andP;  This type of cable is also not totally immune tointerference, so plan carefully before you run it beside motors, relays, orRF-producing devices.andP;  The maximum length of cable is 250 feet for theViewport system and 100 feet (500 for Hercules monochrome) for the AMR's.andO;That may limit how far you can place your workstations.andM;WHICH MULTIUSER OS?andM;When choosing a multiuser graphics terminal, a deciding factor is whichmultiuser operating system is to be used with it.andP;  As the features tableshows, not every terminal can be used with every multiuser system.andM;And the choice of an operating system depends on which applications you want.andO;If you want to run multiple copies of Microsoft Excel under Windows or usesome other application that people in your organization already know, you'llchoose one of the multiuser DOS operating systems instead of somethingtotally different like Unix (see &quot;Building Workgroup Solutions: DOS and theMultiuser Operating System,&quot; PC Magazine, September 12, 1989).andM;Another option in running DOS-based programs, however, is to choose a systemthat allows your favorite application to run under Unix: VP/ix, fromInteractive Systems, is one that does (see &quot;An Alliance of Convenience: DOSUnder Unix,&quot; PC Magazine, April 11, 1989).andM;Finally, you might not care what program or what operating system you use aslong as the total system has the functions you need.andM;TERMINAL PERFORMANCEandM;For our performance tests, we ran each hardware system on a Dell 386/25 withIntelligent Graphics Corp.'s VM/386 operating system.andP;  We chose the VM/386operating simply because it has drivers for all the hardware platforms.andP;  It'sworth noting that the different hardware products will perform verydifferently with other operating systems.andM;We can, however, make some generalizations.andP;  Overall, even the heaviestAutoCAD shop will be happy with a four-node system running on a single 386PC.andP;  None of these systems, objectively, gave quite the throughput of asingle user on the 386 machine running under DOS.andP;  But outside of the tests,our team was hard-pressed to tell the difference.andP;  The only point we reallynoticed a slowdown was when more than one terminal used the host's hard diskdrive at the same time.andP;  Slowdowns due to disk I/O are common to allmultiuser systems-even LANs and mainframes.andM;Color graphics terminals teamed with multiuser operating systems offereconomy, ease of installation, small size, and security.andP;  If you are anarchitect, interior designer, realtor, or security agent, there are CAD,design and visual database programs available to meet the needs of yourorganization on multiuser systems.andM;Your system choices come down to the kind of job you need to accomplish.andP;  Ifyou have a small team of heavy graphics users and you want to equip them withthe most economical yet workable system, the long-cable architecture may bejust what you are looking for.andP;  If, however, you have an environment thatneeds the distance or noise immunity of a fiber-optic cable, then SunRiver'sbus-extension architecture may be preferable.andM;PC MAGAZINE EDITOR'S CHOICEandM;* AMR VIDEO GRAPHICS NETWORK ADAPTORandM;You won't maka a mistake selecting any of the three multiuser terminalsystems reviewed.andP;  They all install easily and deliver excellent graphics onmultiple workstatios.andM;It's easy, however, to award the Editor's Choice to the AMR Video GraphicsNetwork Adapter.andP;  The system furnishes excellent VGA-quality video with fastresponse and low cost.andP;  the VGNA hardware isn't compatible with everypossible operating system, but you'll still have good operating systemsoftware choices, including both DOS- and Unix-compatible products.andM;If you must run cables between the terminal and host systems that are over ahundred feet or so, it may pay to consider the SunRiver workstations instead.andO;SunRiver makes sophisticated, high-quality products, but its prices limit theappeal of its products to those who have specific requirements to meet or whowant the flexibility to mix Sunriver's video adaptors.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
