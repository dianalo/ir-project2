(chart)andM;</DESCRIPT><TEXT>OPTi bas begun sampling its EISAWB chip set, the first EISA system logic tocome from a vendor other than Intel.andP;  Previously, OPTi has been best knownfor their high-end AT-compatible chip sets with integrated cache controllersfor the 386DX and 486DX processors.andP;  More recently, they have also introducedsingle-chip products for mid-range AT-compatible motherboards based on the386SX.andM;The EISAWB is a four-chip solution for high-end systems based on the 386DX,486SX, 486DX, and 487DX.andP;  Initially it will be offered at 33 and 40 MHz (thelatter for use with AMD's Am386DX), with plans to offer 50 MHz when Intelreleases a formal specification for processors at that speed.andP;  OPTi hasdemonstrated systems running at 50 MHz, using conventional 486 parts cooledwith Velox's ICECAP Peltier-effect module.andM;When EISA was first introduced, the members of the EISA consortium agreed touse Intel's 82350 chip set to guarantee a high degree of hardwarecompatibility in the first generation of EISA systems.andP;  (Intel has recentlyintroduced an updated version, the 8235ODT, see [micro]PR 5/1/91 p. 15.)andO;Perhaps it was Intel's head start or the daunting complexity of the EISAspecification, but up to the present there have been no other vendors of EISAsystem logic.andP;  Chips and Technologies and Texas Instruments are said to bedeveloping EISA chip sets, but data sheets and silicon have yet to appear.andO;This lack of competing vendors for such a critical technology has raiseddoubts about EISA's long-term future, making OPTi's embrace a significantevent in EISA history.andM;Figure 1 is a block diagram of a system based on the EISAWB chip set.andP;  Aswith most chip sets that have an integrated cache controller, the cache tagand data memories are implemented in external SRAM.andP;  The direct-mapped,copyback cache can range in size from 64K to 512K bytes.andP;  Like most OPTicache controllers, snooping is not supported.andM;At 33 MHz, the SRAM speed requirement is 20 ns for the tag memory and 25 nsfor data; at 50 MHz it is 15 and 20 ns, respectively.andP;  Ib achieve thenecessary speed at reasonable cost, the data SRAM is 2-way interleaved.andP;  The486DX's burstmode can be handled at2-1-1-1 when reading from the cache(3-1-1-1 is optional, for slower parts).andP;  At 33 MHz, the burst speed is3-2-2-2 when reading from DRAM (assuming 80 ns RAMS).andP;  These numbers refer tothe clocks-per-transfer for each word of a burst, 2-1-1-1 being the fastestburst supported by the 486DX.andM;Up to 256M of DRAM is supported, using one to four banks of 1M, 4M, or 16MDRAM chips.andP;  Page mode is supported, but not interleaving.andP;  There are no EMSregisters.andP;  EMS registers are a useless feature for 386- and 486-basedsystems since their function can be performed by the MMU, but they persist inmany chip sets for purely marketing reasons.andM;The Integrated System Peripheral (ISP) includes the standard peripheralfunctions (DMA controller, interrupt controller, and timers), but a real-timeclock and CMOS RAM must be supplied externally.andP;  The latter can be providedin a single package using a product such as Dallas Semiconductor's DS1488.andM;The chip set is packaged in four 160-pin plastic quad flat-packs (PQFP).andP;  Tosave pins, the configuration registers in the Memory/Cache Controller (MCC)and the EISA Bus Controller (EBC) only implement the low four bits, so theyonly need to connect to four bits of the XD bus (the on-board 8-bitperipheral bus).andM;The Data Bus Controller (DBC) buffers both the XD and MD buses.andP;  The latteris a 32-bit memory data bus.andP;  The standard EISA buses (i.e., the SD, LA, andSA buses) are buffered externally.andP;  In addition to its buffering functions,the DBC provides decoding for the keyboard interface, real-time clock,configuration SRAM, and two general-purpose chip-select outputs.andM;ConclusionandM;It is inevitable that designers will compare the EISAWB against its onlycompetition, Intel's 82350DT.andP;  The main difference between Intel and OPTI isthat the latter is more oriented toward desktop PC's.andP;  Intel's solution ismore oriented toward server machines, which have many high-bandwidthperipherals and lots of DRAM.andM;With its wide 128-bit memory bus and rich support for tweaking DRAM timing,an 82350DT chip set combined with a cache controller can be expected to reachsomewhat higher levels of performance than the EISAWB, especially in systemsheavily loaded with I/O activity.andP;  In particular, the EISAWB lacks supportfor interleaved DRAM, which is important for efficient main memoryperformance at higher clock rates.andP;  Fortunately for OPTi, the most common PCbenchmarks are small enough to fit within the cache, so they aren't sensitiveto DRAM performance.andM;In OPTi's favor is their smaller form factor, synchronous design, and price.andO;At the same 1K-unit quantity, OPTI beats Intel by $50 per chip set.andP;  And whenthe cache controller is considered-included with the OPTI chip set, butexternal in the Intel design-the price gap increases by another $100 or more.andO;</TEXT></DOC>
