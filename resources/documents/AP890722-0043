Andreotti was expected to form the government today, presentinga list of Cabinet ministers to President Francesco Cossiga. Thecoalition would succeed one led by Christian Democrat PremierCiriaco De Mita that fell two months ago.   Leaders of the five parties that have governed in a coalition inrecent years met with Andreotti Friday and approved his proposedprogram.   ``After this evening's meeting, the crisis can be considereddefinitely resolved,'' Socialist Party leader Bettino Craxi toldreporters after the three-hour session.   No major changes in policy were expected.   The last government fell when Craxi criticized De Mita'sleadership shortly before the European Parliament elections. Mostobservers said Craxi expected his party to make electoral gains andwanted to be able to parlay them into a stronger position ingovernment. However, the Socialists recorded only a slight increase.   The Socialists are the second-largest party in the governmentafter the dominant Christian Democrats. Also in the coalition arethe small Republican, Liberal and Social Democrat parties.   Italy's second-largest party, the Communists, have been kept outof government for four decades.   Andreotti, a Christian Democrat, was asked to form a governmenttwo weeks ago after De Mita failed to revive the 13-month-oldcoalition that collapsed on May 19.   Andreotti, who served as foreign minister in the De Mitagovernment, was premier twice in 1972-73 and three timessuccessively in 1976-79.</TEXT></DOC>
