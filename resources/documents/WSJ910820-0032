The deposition of President Gorbachev deprives theDemocrats of one of their most seductive messages: the notionthat the U.S. now needs a president whose focus is at homerather than on foreign-policy questions. At the same time,the Democrats' clamor to slash defense spending and step upsupport for social programs seems suddenly less appealing inthe wake of the apparent rise of Soviet hard-liners.</LP><TEXT>   Though the stunning ouster of Mr. Gorbachev undercut Mr.Bush's Soviet dealings, the president still towers above allof his potential rivals in his experience and fluency inforeign policy. Even before the current crisis, the latestWall Street Journal/NBC News poll showed Mr. Bush enjoyed farhigher public confidence than a prospective Democraticpresident on foreign-policy issues.   One result of this week's upheaval in the Soviet Union isto underline the weaknesses of all of the Democraticcontenders, declared or undeclared. &quot;Foreign policy isordinarily a Republican advantage, but it's even more so withthis group of Democrats,&quot; says Larry Bartels, a University ofRochester specialist in presidential campaigns. &quot;It's hard tothink of a Democrat, running or not, who could even make agood shot at a credible campaign in this atmosphere.&quot;   Still, Mr. Bush could face important hurdles tore-election, especially if the Soviet events precipitate aneconomic downturn just as the U.S. recession shows signs ofending. &quot;The big danger for Bush is a crisis that createsenough stress on everything he's put in motion -- not onlythe Soviets but the Mideast and the economy as well,&quot; saysKevin Phillips, a Republican political theorist.   The president also will be under pressure from all sidesto take a tough stance toward the new Soviet leadership. &quot;Theworld has got to move in unison and isolate&quot; the Soviets, &quot;Imean total isolation of the Soviet Union,&quot; says Sen. ConnieMack (R., Fla.). He says the U.S. should warn the Soviets of&quot;grave reactions&quot; to violent crackdowns on the Baltic statesand the republics.   &quot;The United States should not continue business as usualwith Soviet dictators who deny citizens their democraticrights and follow a path of brutal repression,&quot; says Sen.Bill Bradley (D., N.J.). &quot;Still, under all circumstances, weshould continue to maintain nuclear and conventional armsagreements.&quot;   With the summer nearing its end, Democrats were girdingfor a late-beginning presidential race that would emphasizesuch issues as health care and the economy. &quot;For weeks we'vebeen talking about how we have to turn our attention todomestic issues and the economy,&quot; says Ned Helms, a formerDemocratic party chairman in New Hampshire. &quot;Well, that wasyesterday.&quot;   In an instant, Democrats are deprived of the idea thatdefense spending could be pared even more, with the peacedividend siphoned off for a health-care program or newinitiatives on child care.   &quot;Anyone talking about taking money away from defense isn'tgoing to get much of an audience, whether this coup sticks ornot, whether there is a civil war or not,&quot; says JamesReichley, a Brookings Institution political scientist.   Even so, many Democrats vowed to stay the course with aprimarily domestic political appeal. &quot;I continue to believethat the 1992 election will focus on domestic issues -- onthe economy, on the fact that Americans feel insecure onhealth care, housing and the environment,&quot; says DemocraticParty Chairman Ronald Brown. &quot;Americans are increasinglyconvinced that this administration is bored by domesticissues.&quot;   &quot;Underneath, there is still grave concern about domesticissues,&quot; says William Hamilton, a Democratic pollster.&quot;People still think the country is going in the wrongdirection, and that's not going to go away.&quot;   Former Sen. Paul Tsongas of Massachusetts, the onlydeclared Democratic presidential candidate, indicated that hewouldn't adjust the character of his campaign, whichaddresses economic issues. &quot;My argument will not change,&quot;says Mr. Tsongas, who nonetheless will emphasize his serviceon the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. &quot;I'll argue thatwith economic instability, things happen -- and that we haveour own economic instability to worry about.&quot;   Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who is expected to enterthe Democratic race next month, says, &quot;We ought to give thepresident a decent breathing space here,&quot; adding, &quot;I thinkpeople like me shouldn't say much right now.&quot;   Mr. Clinton, like potential candidates Gov. Douglas Wilderof Virginia and Sen. Tom Harkin of Iowa, had mapped campaignsassailing the president for his lack of attention to domesticaffairs. Another potential Democratic contender, Sen. AlbertGore of Tennessee, has been outspoken on foreign-policy anddefense issues, generally taking a more conservative viewthan many of his Democratic colleagues.   &quot;The gods of politics have dealt this guy {Mr. Bush}another race,&quot; says Harrison Hickman, a Democratic politicalconsultant. &quot;None of the people in the field can arm-wrestlewith the president on these kinds of issues unless they growan awful lot very fast.&quot;   Mr. Brown, the party chairman, says Democrats would probeMr. Bush on foreign-policy issues, raising questions aboutwhether U.S. interests have actually been advanced under thepresident's stewardship. &quot;There are a lot of people who arewondering what this `New World Order' is and how much moresecure we're supposed to be,&quot; he says.   Democrats yesterday took solace in the fact that theSoviet coup occurred more than a year before the U.S.election.   &quot;If this were October 1992, Bush would go up almost asmuch as Gorbachev went down,&quot; says Ann Lewis, a longtimeparty activist.   Mr. Brown and House Majority Leader Richard Gephardt ofMissouri both raised questions about the performance of U.S.intelligence officials assigned to monitoring Soviet affairs.Others already are toying with an attempt to portray Mr. Bushas a passive observer on the carousel of world events, eitherunable or unwilling to give direction to a world intransition.   &quot;The best we can do is argue that Bush is a man watchingthe world go by, sitting in Kennebunkport hoping for thebest,&quot; says Natalie Davis, a Birmingham-Southern Collegepolitical scientist and a member of the Democratic NationalCommittee. &quot;He's not the player in all of this. Everybodyexpected but didn't expect this, and the way to get at Bushis to portray him as surprised, too.&quot;   Mr. Bush has vulnerabilities, political analysts say, butthe Democrats have potentially more serious ones,particularly with the uncertain shape of the Soviet Union.&quot;As things crumble, Bush could be hurt,&quot; says Gary Orren, aHarvard University expert on public opinion. But one problemfor the president's political rivals, he says, is that&quot;people may not want any of these Democratseyeball-to-eyeball with anyone.&quot;   ---   John Harwood contributed to this article.</TEXT></DOC>
