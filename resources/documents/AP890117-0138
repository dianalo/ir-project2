Police had no clues Tuesday about the conflicting claims from thethree groups in the Saturday abduction of the 69-year-oldconservative politician and businessman.   A parliamentary commission on Tuesday was to have beguninvestigating allegations that Vanden Boeynants accepted bribes whenhe was a defense minister for seven years in the 1970s. Theproceedings were suspended because of his disappearance near hishome in a posh Brussels neighborhood.   One of the groups, which called itself the RevolutionarySocialist Brigade, said Vanden Boeynants, is ``a corrupt person ...who has stolen large public funds for his own profit.'' Thepreviously unknown group said in a letter it would put him before a``People's Tribunal.''   Also on Tuesday, a man claiming to represent the left-wingterrorist Fighting Communist Cells said in a taped telephone messageto a news agency that Vanden Boeynants would be killed in three daysif four of its militants were not released from prison.   The third claim of responsibility was made to a radio station inthe Netherlands. The radio station said it received a call from aperson purporting to represent the notorious leftist Frenchterrorist group Direct Action.   None of the groups offered proof they held Vanden Boeynants.   Justice Minister Melchior Wathelet said investigators are sure ofonly three things: Vanden Boeynants was the victim of awell-prepared but violent kidnapping; he felt threatened before hewas abducted; and a ransom has been demanded.   There actually were two claims from the group identifying itselfas the Revolutionary Socialist Brigade, one in telephone call andthe other in letters sent to two newspapers demanding the $790,000ransom.   The letters demanded that two-thirds of the money come fromVanden Boeynants' political and business allies and be distributedto the poor through five relief agencies.   The remaining third of the ransom would fund the brigade'sprogram ``to motivate the people,'' the letters said.   The phone call, also purportedly from the Revolutionary SocialistBrigade, and related by deputy prosecutor Andre Vandoren, said:``You will never see him again. We will return him in small pieces.''   Wathelet said on national television that many unansweredquestions remain.   ``Anything is still possible as regards the (identity of the)kidnappers,'' he said.''   Officials have expressed concern about the health of VandenBoeynants, who needs daily medication for a heart ailment.   He was prime minister between 1966 and 1968 and again from late1978 until early 1979.   In 1986, he received a three-year suspended sentence for taxfraud as head of his meat packaging business. That conviction forcedhim to drop a bid to become mayor of Brussels in October.</TEXT></DOC>
