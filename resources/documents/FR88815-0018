(Section 706.1)<T3>Comment: </T3>Three commenters suggested changes to the provisionson special activities awards. The commenters were concerned that specialactivities awards would be used to fund small grant competitions, createunnecessary competitions among laboratories or centers, and reduce theamount of funding available for institutional operations awards. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary has proposed special activities awardsto allow needed flexibility to provide supplemental funding to existinglaboratories or centers to carry out additional research and related activitiesthat are consistent with the mission of a center or the long range planof a regional laboratory approved by the Secretary. Special activitiesawards provide the Secretary with flexibility in supporting additionalresearch and related activities not addressed by currently funded centersor laboratories. Special activities awards may be supported from fundsset aside for laboratories and centers pursuant to section 405(g)(1) (A)and (B) of the General Education Provisions Act, as amended (GEPA). Fundsfor special activities may reduce the amount of funding available for institutionaloperations awards. However, the Secretary intends only to use a minimumamount of funds to support special activities awards. <T3>Change: </T3>None. Who is eligible for an award? (Section 706.2) <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters questioned the proposed changes to theeligibility provisions for regional educational laboratories. One commentersuggested that the proposed changes were beyond the scope of the authorizingstatute because they included public agencies as eligible applicants fora laboratory award. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary has not changed the eligible partiesfor this program. Section 405(d)(4) of GEPA specifically provides thatthe Secretary supports regional educational laboratories established bypublic agencies or private nonprofit organizations. Under these regulations,these entities are eligible to apply for an institutional operations award.The revised language makes clear that an eligible party may apply for alaboratory institutional operations award without first establishing alaboratory.<T3>Change: </T3>None. What priorities may the Secretary establish? (Section 706.3) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended two additional priorities:the implementation and effects of educational policies, and the relationshipbetween education and the economy. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The regulations include a priority that addressesthe commenter's concern about the relationship between education and theeconomy: Education, work and careers. However, the Secretary agrees withthe commenter's recommendation to add a priority concerning the implementationand effects of educational policy. <T3>Change: </T3>The list of research priorities has been amended to adda priority on the implementation and effects of educational policies. What regulations apply? (Section 706.4) <T3>Comment: </T3>Two commenters expressed concern that technical changesproposed concerning the applicability of the regulations to contracts suggestedthe Department's intent to support only grants. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The technical changes do not affect the Department'sauthority to award contracts. The Secretary may make awards under contracts,as well as grants. These changes have been made to be consistent with theDepartment's policy that contracts not be governed by program regulations.While these regulations no longer govern contracts, requirements substantiallysimilar to pertinent provisions of the program regulations will be incorporatedinto any solicitation for a laboratory or center contract, to the extentthat the requirements are consistent with applicable contract regulations.<T3>Change: </T3>None. What definitions apply? (Section 706.5) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the change in the definitionfor ``mission'' to mean the priority or priorities for the laboratory orcenter established by the Secretary. The commenter felt that under thisdefinition the Secretary rather than the regionally representative governingboard would establish the laboratory's regional agenda. Another commenterasked why the definition of ``educational research'' had been changed toeliminate dissemination, policy studies and technical assistance, and whetherthe elimination of these terms meant that regional educational laboratorieswere no longer authorized to carry out these activities. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary did not intend to limit the role ofthe regionally representative governing board to set the regional agendaof the laboratory. The definition of educational research has been changed to be consistentwith the definition in section 405(a)(3)(C) of GEPA. Regional laboratoriesare authorized under andSection; 707.20(d) to carry out research, developmentand related activities. <T3>Change: </T3>The definition of ``mission'' has been changed to clarifythat the Secretary does not determine the agenda of a laboratory. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part 707_Regional Educational Laboratories </ITAG>What geographic regions do the laboratories serve? (Section 707.2) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter asked for clarification about how serviceswould be provided to the Pacific Trust Territories. The commenter alsorequested clarification of the role of the regional educational laboratoriesin providing services to the Pacific Trust Territories. <T3>Discussion: </T3>Until the effective date of its Compact of Free Association,the current Pacific Trust Territory, Palau, will continue to receive technicalassistance. After the effective date of its Compact of Free Association,Palau will be situated similarly to the Marshall Islands and the FederatedStates of Micronesia. These entities may receive technical assistance froma laboratory, to the extent approved by the Secretary. Assistance wouldbe provided pursuant to the Compacts of Free Association with these entities,and the role of the laboratory in providing this assistance would be determinedby the Department and the regional governing board of the laboratory. <T3>Change: </T3>A technical change has been made to clarify that afterthe effective date of its Compact of Free Association, Palau may continueto receive technical assistance, to the extent approved by the Secretary.What are the selection criteria for laboratory awards for planning? (Section707.10(d)_Plan of operation and Section 707.10(e)_Quality of key personnel)What are the selection criteria for laboratory awards for institutionaloperations? (Section 707.11(d)_Plan of operation and Section 707.11(e)_Qualityof key personnel) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter objected to the removal of provisions inthe selection criteria for laboratory planning and institutional operationawards related to an applicant's commitment to ensure that ``traditionallyunderrepresented groups'' are served and employed by the project. The commenterbelieves that the removal of these provisions may be interpreted as anabandonment of the principle that an important goal of the Regional EducationalLaboratories Program to provide equality of educational opportunity forpoor and minority children. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The removal of the provisions in the selection criteriaconcerning traditionally underrepresented groups does not mean that theSecretary intends to support laboratories which ignore the needs of underrepresentedgroups. The selection criteria in andSection;andSection; 707.10(a) and 707.11(a)concerning the extent to which the applicant understands and is responsiveto the needs of the region to be served, would include the needs of underrepresentedgroups. In addition, these regulations require applicants to provide assurancesthat they will provide training for individuals, emphasizing training opportunitiesfor women and members of minority groups. The Secretary has replaced thelanguage in the selection criteria concerning the employment of underrepresentedgroups with selection criteria addressing the extent to which the applicantuses nondiscriminatory employment practices. The Secretary believes thatthese changes are consistent with efforts to provide equal access for specialpopulations to participate in the projects and with ensuring nondiscriminatoryemployment practices. <T3>Changes: </T3>None.What are the selection criteria for laboratory awards for institutionaloperations? (Section 707.11(g)_Evaluation plan) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter requested clarification of the term ``evaluation.''The commenter also asked whether the provision concerning the adequacyof an applicant's ``peer review process'' means external review and ifit does, how the peer review will affect the prerogatives of a laboratorygoverning board to make adjustments in laboratory programs. The commenterasked whether the provision addressing methods of documenting the laboratory'simpact on the needs of ``those served'' in the region referred to director indirect audiences. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The evaluation plan is a description of how the applicantwould assess the degree to which the objectives of the application arebeing achieved and how the applicant would use the results of the selfevaluation. The laboratory's governing board is expected to participatein the evaluation process and the examination of the results of the selfevaluation. Peer review refers to the process that the applicant proposesto use to judge the adequacy of laboratory products, research instruments,and self evaluation designs. Peer reviewers are generally investigatorsor scholars external to an organization in the same or comparable fieldsor disciplines. The term ``those served'' refers to those audiences proposed in the laboratory'splans as the recipients of service. Those served may include audiencesthat participate directly in the laboratory's activities, such as classroomteachers participating in an inservice training program, or those studentswho receive laboratory services indirectly as a result of the trainingreceived by their teachers. <T3>Change: </T3>None. <ITAG tagnum="84">Part 708_Research and Development Centers </ITAG>What are the selection criteria for awards for center planning? (Section708.10(b)_Potential to influence practice) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter suggested expanding this criterion to includepotential to influence policy. The commenter recommended that proposedresearch should address critical issues of relevance to policy as wellas practice. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The Secretary agrees with the recommendation of thecommenter because the purpose of planning awards is to support center activitiesthat have the potential to influence both policy and practice. <T3>Change: </T3>The criterion has been expanded to include the potentialto influence policymaking. What are the selection criteria for center awards for institutional operations?(Section 708.11(d)_Technical soundness) <T3>Comment: </T3>One commenter recommended incorporating technical soundnessas a subcriterion under the selection criteria for mission and strategyand plan of operation (andSection; 708.11 (a) and (c)). The commenter suggeststhat technical soundness is a relevant and significant factor that shouldapply to the proposed mission and plan of operation. <T3>Discussion: </T3>The criterion, technical soundness, is intended tobe a separate criterion used to judge whether appropriate and adequatemethodologies are employed in the research of the center. The mission andstrategies criterion addresses an applicant's understanding of a center'smission but does not address the actual means by which the research andrelated activities of the proposed project may be carried out. The criterionfor the plan of operation is intended to assess the adequacy of the overallmanagement plan for the center and the institutional roles and responsibilities.These criteria are independent factors to be considered in judging theoverall merit of an application for a center award. <T3>Change: </T3>None. <ITAG tagnum="40">[FR Doc. 88-18365 Filed 8-12-88; 8:45 am] </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="68">BILLING CODE 4000-01-M</ITAG></ITAG></ITAG></TEXT></DOC>
