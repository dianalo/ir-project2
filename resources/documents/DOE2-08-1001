For ease of understanding,a brief summary of the Model is included. The model is presented in twovolumes. Volume 1 contains a systematic collation of maintenance informationand assembles the maintenance data available within the community. Itindicates the confidence that can be attached to this data, and showsup areas of unreliable data and, where necessary, provides a set of assumptionsthat can be used as a consistent basis until better data becomes available.Volume 2 provides a method of costing the maintenance of a wave energysystem. The data from Volume 1 can be used as the input to Volume 2 toproduce an annual operating cost for a 2GW array based on a particulardevice.</TEXT></DOC>
