The ministers of the Organization of Petroleum ExportingCountries planned to return tonight to Vienna to resume their winterconference in hopes of formally approving a pact to slash thecartel's rampant oil production from more than 22 million barrels aday estimated now to 18.5 million barrels daily.   In response to the tentative accord, futures price for Januarydelivery of Brent, the benchmark North Sea crude, jumped $1.65 abarrel to $14.42 Friday in London trading.   U.S. petroleum exchanges closed early Wednesday for the four-dayThanksgiving holiday, but analysts said U.S. markets would match theEuropean gains if the OPEC ministers signed a final accord over theweekend.   Futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange closedslightly higher Wednesday in anticipation OPEC would reach some sortof agreement. The contract for January delivery of West TexasIntermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude, closed 11 centshigher at $13.97 a barrel.   One of the key provisions of the pact would grant Iraq productionparity with its Persian Gulf enemy Iran, something Iran had foughtbitterly. However, the proposal also reportedly would allow Iran toincrease its production and maintain its 14 percent share of OPECproduction.   Analysts said they expect an agreement to bolster prices in theshort term, but said they doubted the accord would last long enoughto boost prices to OPEC's target of $18 a barrel.   Iranian Oil Minister Gholamreza Aghazadeh flew Friday to Tehranto consult with his government, which signed a cease-fire with Iraqin August to halt their eight-year war.   Aghazadeh said in Tehran today that he will consult with Iran'sCabinet on Sunday about how to respond to the proposed OPECproduction ceiling, Tehran Radio said in a report monitored inCyprus.   Even if the 13 nations sign the plan, analysts are uncertain itcould hold.   Recent cheating on cartel quotas has added to the glut of oil onthe market, driving down prices.   William Byers, an analyst at Bear, Stearns andamp; Co. in New York,said, ``We don't know if OPEC nations are going to adhere to anagreement.''   ``If so,'' he said, ``prices could go higher, but that's anassumption that's premature to make.''   Steve Hanke, economics professor at Johns Hopkins University inBaltimore, said, ``Cheating could occur right from day one. And infact, there's every reason to believe it will.''   Fergus MacLeod, an oil analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd inLondon, said he doubted whether the price of West Texas Intermediatewould climb beyond $17 a barrel.   Each rise of $1 in the price of crude oil theoretically means apickup of 2.5 cents a gallon in retail gasoline prices, although oilcompanies do not always pass along the full increase.   MacLeod said, ``In terms of its impact on prices at the gas pump,you may not get a direct feedthrough from the increase in oilprices. It's difficult to pass on the full increase,'' he said.   Ian Graham, an analyst at the London brokerage County NatWest,noted companies had not reduced gasoline prices when oil pricesslumped.   ``There seems little justification for increasing them on the wayback up,'' he said.   The ministers began their winter meeting Monday and then recessedfor closed-door negotiations to try to end a bitter dispute betweenrivals Iran and Iraq.   Iraq had been demanding an equal production quota in any newaccord with Iran, but Aghazadeh had said no.   It appears that the production agreement will give each countrythe same quota at 2.64 million barrels a day.   Iran now has a cap of 2.4 million barrels a day.   Iraq was given a ceiling of 1.5 million barrels in the currentpact, but has ignored it. Analysts estimate its production at 2.7million barrels a day.   To cut the deal, the ministers agreed to let Iran pump more oil,while paring other countries' output levels to meet the new quotas.   The other countries agreed to give up some of their productionshare to make up Iraq's quota, but details were not disclosed.   OPEC members are Algeria, Ecuador, Gabon, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,Kuwait, Libya, Nigeria, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emiratesand Venezuela.</TEXT></DOC>
