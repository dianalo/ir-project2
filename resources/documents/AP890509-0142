ROSENTHAL</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The environmental group Greenpeace accused theAgriculture Department on Tuesday of failing to ensure that milkprovided in its school lunch program is free of the cancer-causingchemical dioxin.   The group has asked for a meeting as soon as possible withofficials of the department's food and nutrition service, whichturned down an earlier Greenpeace petition to require that milkcartons used in the school lunch programs be made of material thatwon't put dioxin in the milk.   Gene Vincent, an Agriculture Department spokesman, saidofficials scheduled a department meeting on the subject later inthe day.   Greenpeace contends a Canadian government study shows paper milkcartons made of paper bleached with chlorine can contain traceamounts of dioxin, the most powerful cause of cancer ever tested inlaboratory animals.   ``They have basically disparaged scientific findings,'' JanetHieber of Greenpeace told a news conference. She signed the group'sletter to Geroge A. Braley, deputy administrator for SpecialNutrition Programs, asking for a meeting.   ``Newly available scientific information shows that milkpackaged in chlorine-bleached cartons poses a clear health threatto children because these bleached cartons are contaminated withdioxin that migrates into the children's milk,'' she wrote.   On Feb. 13, Greenpeace petitioned the department to start aformal rule-making proceeding to forbid bleached cartons for thenearly 5 billion half-points of milk that USDA pays for each yearunder five programs. It also asked temporary regulations to requiremilk be provided in unbleached cartons, returnable glass bottles orthe like.   In response, Braley said further study of the Canadian tests isnecessary and studies are being conducted by both the EnvironmentalProtection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration.   Braley said that to take Greenpeace's action without furtherstudies ``would be extremely disruptive'' and alternative half-pintcontainers for milk in glass or containers bleached without usingchlorine were not available.   Ms. Hieber was asked how much milk a child would have to drinkfrom the current packaging to be harmed.   ``From what we have seen in animal testing, even drinking acarton a day is unhealthy,'' she said.   ``We have not found any amount that is not toxic. Most of theeffects are latent ... you won't see the effects for 10 to 20years, maybe 30 years.''   She said alternative bleaching methods are available that won'tleach dioxin into milk.   Asked what parents might do, she replied ``write to legislators,the Secretary of Agriculture. In essence, you have no choice asparents. I think parents should definitely be talking to theirschool boards about this.''</TEXT></DOC>
