On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the June contract for WestTexas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of U.S. crude oil, settled32 cents higher at $19.76 a 42-gallon barrel. The contract haddeclined 58 cents Monday.   Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange,wholesale unleaded gasoline for June delivery rose 0.54 cent to65.52 cents a gallon, after losing 2.52 cents Monday.   June heating oil, which declined 2.12 cents the previoussession, settled at 46.99 cents a gallon, up 0.30 cent.   William Byers, an energy analyst with Bear, Stearns andamp; Co.,attributed Tuesday's price increase primarily to internal forces ofsupply and demand in the market, in the absence of any fundamentalchanges.   ``There was a feeling that the market was oversold,'' Byers said.   He said the market remained concerned about an oil glut amongOPEC producers.   Monday's selloff was triggered by a report that showed membersof the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries had boostedtheir daily production last month to 20.9 million barrels.   OPEC's self-imposed quota is 18.5 million barrels a day.</TEXT></DOC>
