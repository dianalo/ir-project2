Daimler, whose largest unit is Mercedes-Benz AG, reportedprofit of 880 million marks ($505 million) for the firsthalf, up 4.8% from 840 million marks the year earlier, on an8.6% increase in revenue to 43.84 billion marks from 40.38billion marks.</LP><TEXT>   Volkswagen confirmed earlier estimates of a 1.2% climb infirst-half net income to 433 million marks from 428 millionmarks a year earlier on a 12% increase in sales to 39.56billion marks from 35.24 billion marks.   Both companies predicted full-year earnings would be aboutunchanged from year-earlier levels as decelerating domesticsales growth and tight profit margins eat into gains fromfavorable exchange rates and recoveries in key exportmarkets.   The German Automobile Industry Association said thedomestic market for personal and commercial vehicles hasbegun to &quot;return to normal&quot; after nearly a year of recordsales.   Just as most other European auto makers went intotailspins amid weak economies in mid-1990, German producersbegan to benefit from the economic and monetary unificationof the two Germanys. Eastern Germans, tired of Trabants andeager to sit behind the steering wheels of western Germandriving machines, caused a run on both used and new vehicles.   But while most German manufacturers can still boast offilled order books for the second half, the local economy hasbegun to slow. Achim Diekmann, an auto association director,said he &quot;wouldn't be surprised&quot; if domestic order inflowsfell 10% on a full-year basis.   German companies are hoping that key export markets,especially the U.S. and U.K., will begin to kick in aroundthe same time German growth is slowing.   &quot;Some major markets are picking up,&quot; Mr. Diekmann said,citing the U.K., France and Italy.   He said there was a chance that improvements in those andother markets might keep German factories producing atcurrent levels.   Daimler noted that first-half statistics didn't show anysigns of a recovery afoot in the U.S., where group revenuefell 6.1% to 5.55 billion marks.   Sales of Mercedes-Benz cars were up 17% in Germany and 9%in Italy. About 75% of Daimler's group revenue and most ofits profits are attributable to sales and leasing ofMercedes-Benz luxury cars and commercial vehicles.   Volkswagen also noted a continuation of higher domesticand lower foreign sales. In Germany, group sales rose 12% inthe first half, but abroad they fell 13%. Sales in the U.S.fell 30% to 58,565 units, Volkswagen said.   South America remained a trouble spot. In Brazil,inflation outpaced price increases allowed for auto makers.While sales of Volkswagen's Autolatina unit rose 8.3% in thefirst half, the profit margin was pinched.   Mexico was one of the few happy chapters in the company'sforeign adventures. Volkswagen de Mexico reported a salesgain of 12% for a 37% share of the market for personal cars.Exports of Mexican-made Volkswagens to the U.S. and Canadaincreased 16%, the company added.</TEXT></DOC>
