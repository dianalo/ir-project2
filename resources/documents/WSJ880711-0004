The Agriculture Department, in a report set for release tomorrow, is expected to project less damage to the corn and soybean crops than most private analysts believe is certain to occur. That is stirring controversy among farm groups, traders and merchants who say the widely publicized report will merely muddy the outlook.    Nevertheless, the official crop estimate is anxiously awaited as a benchmark indicator of the drought's cost so far and its potential impact on food prices. The report also should provide clues to the Reagan administration's future stance on disaster relief to farmers, export-subsidy programs and other crucial aspects of farm policy.    Among other things, the report may signal such a sharp drop in the nation's grain stockpiles next year that the department might later abandon or modify its planted-acreage restrictions. Currently, wheat and corn farmers are required to idle land in order to qualify for government subsidies and income-support payments.    The report is unusual, not only because of worries about the drought, but because it includes assessments of spring-planted crops, such as corn and soybeans, a month earlier than usual. Typically, the government withholds those estimates until August, when yields are better established.    The government's estimate is expected to be conservative because it has such serious implications for policy and the farm economy. It is also early in the season, and forecasters will have several opportunities to lift their damage estimates in subsequent reports, when the outlook becomes clearer.    The department is widely expected to project a 25% reduction in the corn harvest, less than a 10% cut in wheat production and a relatively small reduction in the soybean crop, which hasn't yet reached its crucial stage of development.    Many private economists and analysts think such numbers fail to reflect the severity of the worst drought since the Dust Bowl. &quot;The government historically has a record of not appreciating the severity of changes,&quot; said Conrad Leslie, a private crop forecaster in Chicago. &quot;They lean to a lack of boldness.&quot;    The outlook among many private-sector observers is much grimmer. If the drought continues through Friday, as expected, many analysts see the corn harvest dropping to four billion to five billion bushels, a reduction of 31% to 45% from a projected harvest of 7.3 billion bushels, based on normal yields. Last year's corn crop was 7.1 billion bushels.    Such a drop in corn production would rival the percentage declines recorded at the end of the two worst Midwest drought years of this century, 1934 and 1983. Agronomists are particularly alarmed because several weeks are left in the growing season, opening the door to big increases in damage.    What's more, the report will mask the severity of damage in the hardest-hit states. The Indiana corn crop has lost 40% of its yield potential and is losing more each day, state officials say. In some sections, entire fields have died, said Dave Mengel, a Purdue University agronomist. &quot;It's scary. We'll talk to our grandkids about the drought of 1988.&quot;    Corn, the nation's No. 1 crop in terms of market value, is the most vulnerable among major crops right now. Most of the plants are pollinating, a process of a few weeks during which hot and dry conditions can stifle fertilization and dramatically reduce yields.    Soybeans, a hardier plant, can regenerate more readily than corn and don't reach the crucial development stage until later in the summer. Also, many farmers have planted soybeans amid their ruined wheat crop, possibly bolstering production.    Nevertheless, without significant rainfall by Friday, Mr. Leslie, the Chicago crop forecaster, sees the soybean crop shrinking by one-fifth to 1.45 billion bushels from a normal harvest of 1.88 billion bushels. Last year's soybean harvest was 1.91 billion bushels.    Government forecasters are warning that tomorrow's projections will be highly tentative. Later in the season, the Agriculture Department bases its reports on extensive field surveys, which have a reputation for unusual accuracy. Tomorrow's report, however, will be based on models instead of field surveys, which won't begin until next month.    &quot;August('s report) will give us a better indication&quot; of actual crop damage, said Jim Donald, chairman of the department's World Agricultural Outlook Board, the source of tomorrow's report.    The report reflects the extreme difficulty of projecting crop damage this year. In years past, the Agriculture Department based its early-season crop estimates on the number of acres planted and the historical trend in yields per acre.    This year, though, the unusually early and intense drought already has invalidated yield trends as an analytical tool. &quot;We feel the trend yields are no longer achievable,&quot; said Mr. Donald of the outlook board. </TEXT></DOC>
