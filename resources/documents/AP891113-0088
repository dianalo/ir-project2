The measure, similar to a bill pending before the Senate, wouldrequire the president to choose from a variety of penalties if hedetermines that a country has used such weapons, such as in Iraq'sactions during the Persian Gulf war and against its own Kurdishminority.   Possible actions include prohibition of U.S. arms sales to theoffending nation, export of goods and technology which could beused to make chemical weapons, restriction of imports from thecountry, a cutoff of any foreign aid, opposition to loans frommultilateral banks and suspension of diplomatic relations.   Proponents said they recognize that U.S. sanctions alone wouldbe relatively ineffective because arms and chemicals are availablefrom other sources, and the bill urges the administration toencourage other countries to join in any sanctions it imposes.   The measure allows the president to waive the sanctions if theywould not be in the national security interests of the UnitedStates.</TEXT></DOC>
