Rabin, speaking Thursday on Israel's Arabic television, promisedhe would bring his proposal to a Cabinet vote if Palestinians in theterritories accepted it, even with reservations. He said army troopsmight be withdrawn from the occupied lands on voting days.   ``We recognize in you a possibility of a political entity,''Rabin told Palestinians. ``Let us be partners for peace.''   Rabin did not elaborate on what he meant by a ``politicalentity,'' but his wording seemed to suggest he was expanding on theidea of limited Palestinian self-rule or autonomy once offered byIsrael.   In the occupied territories Thursday, Israeli soldiers shot andkilled a 25-year-old Palestinian, Issam El Bulbul, during astone-throwing clash in the occupied West Bank town of Nablus, Arabdoctors said. Eight Palestinians were wounded in clashes in the WestBank and occupied Gaza Strip.   The army said El Bulbul ``intended to throw a large brick at asoldier'' when he was shot.   Nablus residents staged a one-day general strike today to protesthis death, which brought to 381 the number of Palestinians killed inthe 14-month rebellion against Israeli rule. Fifteen Israelis havealso been killed.   In clashes today, two Palestinians were wounded in the West Bank,Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed one casualty.   On Thursday, Israeli legislators, including one from thecenter-left Labor Party, caused new tensions in Israel's coalitiongovernment when they met with a prominent Palestinian activist.   Aides to Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir of the right-wing Likudbloc said the recent dialogue between some Israelis and Palestinianslinked to the PLO could reignite violence in the occupied lands andonly strengthened the Palestine Liberation Organization.   Labor leader Shimon Peres expressed support for the meetings ofhis party members with Palestinians and indicated he would join at alater stage despite the opposition of party hawks.   ``I support meetings with the representatives of Palestiniansfrom the territories who are not involved in terrorism,'' Peres saidon Israel Army radio. ``When I have time I'll meet them too.''   Two widely publicized meetings took place earlier this week inJerusalem involving three prominent pro-PLO figures and leadingLabor members.   On Thursday, Amnon Rubinstein, head of the centrist Shinui partyand Labor legislator Avraham Burg met Faisal Husseini, the head ofJerusalem's Arab Studies Center who is closely identified with thePLO.   But a growing uproar over the meeting prompted two reserve armygenerals, Shlomo Gazit and Aharon Yariv, to back out.   Husseini, 48, who has been held in detention during most of theuprising, said he joined in the talks to explain the PLO's positionsto the Israelis.   ``It's time to go and talk to these people, and let them see themonster face to face, and see he is not a monster,'' Husseini said.</TEXT></DOC>
