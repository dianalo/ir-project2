Yang (WSJ Staff) </AUTHOR><SO> </SO><CO> FORGN </CO><IN> MON </IN><G> CNG </G><DATELINE> WASHINGTON  </DATELINE><TEXT>   The Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation expanding opportunities for professionals and skilled workers to immigrate, despite criticism of a provision giving preference to certain large investors who start businesses in the U.S.    The bill, approved on an 88-4 vote and sent to the House, would allow a total of 590,000 immigrants to enter the U.S. each year, 100,000 more than the current level of immigration.    Sponsored by Sens. Edward Kennedy (D., Mass.) and Alan Simpson (R., Wyo.), the measure would more than double openings for professionals and those with special skills or talents who aren't related to U.S. citizens, raising the annual quota for that category to 120,000 from 54,000.    The measure also would limit the number of relatives of U.S. citizens who may move to the country each year to 470,000. Under current law, an unlimited number of spouses and children of Americans may immigrate, and the number of other relatives is limited to 216,000. In fiscal 1987, 220,000 spouses and minor children entered the U.S. Refugees and those seeking political asylum aren't covered by the bill's limits.    A similar measure allowing somewhat more immigration is pending in the House.    Advocates for U.S. immigrants are strongly critical of a provision in both the House and Senate bills that would reserve 4,800 conditional visas annually for immigrants who invest at least $1 million in a business that creates jobs for 10 U.S. citizens or legal residents.    If the investment continues to provide that employment for two years, the investor would become a permanent resident alien and, later, a citizen. Otherwise, the investor would face deportation.    &quot;It is basically selling entry into the United States,&quot; says Margaret Chao, a vice president of the Organization of Chinese Americans. &quot;It reverses the principles that we have traditionally stood for,&quot; says Charles Wheeler, director of the National Center for Immigrant's Rights.    In addition, some argue that the move could accelerate the drain of capital from developing countries. &quot;We do want to encourage investment in the United States and job opportunities, but there are other ways of doing it,&quot; says Martha Jimenez, a policy analyst for the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund.    Backers of the measure disagree. &quot;If you're going to invest money here and employ workers, you ought to have a right to become a citizen here,&quot; says Rep. Charles Schumer (D., N.Y.), sponsor of the House bill. But, he adds, application of the provision must be watched carefully to make sure that &quot;the purpose of the immigration is the investment, not the other way around.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
