Their program differs from that of U.S. auto workers, who are expected to concentrate on job security when they begin their own talks with General Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. later this month. Chrysler Corp.'s U.S. contract doesn't expire until next year.    Robert White, president of the Canadian Auto Workers union, said better pensions will encourage earlier retirement by older workers and thus would reduce the number of lost jobs if auto payrolls shrink in Canada as they have in the U.S. &quot;There is no way we can handle it (job losses) all through pensions, but we can handle a fair amount of it,&quot; he said.    The CAW represents 64,000 workers and 17,000 pensioners at the Canadian units. Mr. White said the union wants an increase in current benefits, plus regular cost-of-living adjustments. Members currently receive a maximum monthly pension of 1,205 Canadian dollars ($912.19) after thirty years' employment.    The union also wants to restore the 3% annual raises that figured in Canadian auto-industry contracts until 1981 and to prohibit workers from being forced to work more than 40 hours a week. The companies currently can require workers to put in 48 hours in a week.    Spokesmen for all three companies said they oppose tying pensions to the cost-of-living index. &quot;We already have a program that encourages people to retire. It's as liberal as any pension scheme in Canada,&quot; said William Fisher, chief negotiator for Chrysler Canada Ltd.    The companies declined to estimate the cost of the union's proposal. But when a committee of Ontario's legislature discussed the possibility of compulsory pension-indexing in April, Ford Motor Co. of Canada said its profits during the past 10 years would have been eliminated if indexing had been required.    Union officials wouldn't estimate the cost of their proposal either, but said it would be less costly to index pensions in Canada than in the U.S., because a smaller percentage of Canadian auto workers have retired.    The union also says the companies can afford to be more generous in Canada, because their hourly labor costs are $7.50 to $8 less than in the U.S. This is because in recent years Canadian dollars had a lower value than U.S. dollars and provincial governments help pay for workers' health insurance.    The CAW talks begin with General Motors of Canada Ltd. today, with Chrysler tomorrow and with Ford Thursday. Each side is expected to exchange opening statements, then adjourn for bargaining over local issues. Formal negotiations on the national contracts will resume early next month. Current contracts expire Sept. 14.    Mr. White said his union isn't coordinating its strategy with the United Auto Workers. &quot;There really isn't much dialogue going on right now,&quot; Mr. White said. He said he expected the two unions to share some information as talks progress.    The CAW withdrew from the U.S. union after Mr. White refused in 1984 to go along with the UAW's willingness to accept profit sharing in lieu of hourly wage increases. The Canadian union struck the GM unit for 13 days over the issue. The strike, which caused the layoff of 51,900 U.S. workers, led to Canadian workers winning more hourly compensation through an increased cost-of-living allowance. Mr. White said he will continue to oppose profit sharing this year.    The CAW currently is in a stronger position than its U.S. counterpart. Employment in the Canadian industry is at an alltime high, and Canadian car sales are only a little below the record pace of two years ago. Mr. White said this summer's talks may be his last chance to win general pension gains before the Canadian units begin to feel competitive pressure from Japanese and South Korean plants in Canada.    Company spokesmen were less forthcoming about their agendas. Chrysler and Ford said they want the negotiations to cover a reduction in the number of job classifications at their Canadian plants, giving them more freedom to move workers from job to job. Ford and GM said they want to talk about higher absenteeism in Canada than in the U.S. None of the companies would say whether they plan to press for profit sharing this year.    Despite the widespread U.S. perception in the industry of Mr. White as the militant leader of a militant union, he recently has made significant concessions to avoid the possible loss of union jobs. Early this year, the CAW agreed to reduce the number of job classifications at GM's plant in Ste. Therese, Quebec, after GM talked of closing it. He even has exempted GM's Windsor, Ontario, trim plant from strike action until Oct. 9, instead of Sept. 14, so the company can build inventory. Mr. White said GM threatened to move jobs out of the plant if it didn't get this concession. Windsor is the sole supplier of certain parts to many U.S. plants, and the strike there in 1984 caused many of the U.S. layoffs.    Mr. White declined to say which company would be the likeliest strike target if talks fail. &quot;I can make an argument for all three,&quot; he said. </TEXT></DOC>
