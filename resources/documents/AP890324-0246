The Occupational Safety and Health Administration said it isalso starting a ``wall-to-wall'' inspection of the entire Burbank,Calif., facility because of the more than 400 violations uncoveredduring a four-month investigation of a classified area where thefighter is assembled.   Under OSHA procedures, Lockheed has 15 working days to contestthe proposed fine. Lockheed spokeman Jim Ragsdale said the companyhad no immediate comment on the alleged violations and likely wouldnot comment until its management had an opportunity to review thecitations.   OSHA cited 251 instances in which it said Lockheed AeronauticalSystems Co. willfully failed to record illnesses and injuries toemployees and 88 alleged willful violations of federal regulationsrequiring employers to inform workers about the potential dangersof chemicals they work with and instruct them on proper safeguards.   In addition, the company was cited for another 99 violations ofvarious OSHA standards, including alleged mislabeling or failure tolabel chemical containers and alleged failure to include healthwarnings on information the company was required to provide to itsworkers.   Other alleged violations included failing to list suspectedcarcinogens on safety sheets provided to workers, overexposingworkers to asbestos and failure to provide workers with glovesimpervious to a hazardous chemical used on the fighter.   The proposed fine follows a highly publicized OSHA inspectionthat followed numerous complaints from workers at the plant, whichemploys about 14,000 people.   In October, a month after the inspection began, John C.Brizendine, the president of the division, said: ``We have seennothing to indicate the materials we work with are fundamentallyunsafe of pose a health hazard provided proper procedures arefollowed.''   A month later, the government for the first time publiclyacknowledged the existence of the stealth fighter, a single-seat,dual-engine jet that resembles a bat and is formally designated theF-117A.   The Defense Department has ordered 59 stealth fihters; 52 hadbeen delivered as of the November announcement.   The fighter uses so-called stealth technology to help it evadeenemy radar, including radar-absorbing materials and other coatings.   Seventy-five employees at the Burbank plant have a suit pendingagainst Lockheed and companies that make and supply the chemicalsused to help the fighter avoid radar detection. More than 100workers have filed workers compensation claims alleging they sufferfrom injuries caused by the chemicals.   The suit and the claims allege composite materials used in thefighter and chemicals used to mill and clean those materials causerashes, nausea, dizziness, memory loss and concentration problems.   OSHA spokesman Frank Kane said the $1.49 million finerepresented the ninth-largest in the agency's 17-year history andthe largest ever levied in California. The record fine was $5.1million against two companies involved in an April 1987 Bridgeport,Conn., building collapse.</TEXT></DOC>
