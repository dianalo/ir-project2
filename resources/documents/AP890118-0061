(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The debut of the Delta 2 space rocketnext month and that of the powerful Titan 4 a few weeks laterhighlight the Air Force's busiest launch year here since 1983, anofficial says.   The Pentagon is counting on both rockets to help orbit a backlogof about 25 national defense payloads that have been grounded sincethe 1986 explosions of the space shuttle Challenger and an unpilotedTitan 34D rocket.   Problems that have held up the two launches for months are beingresolved, Air Force Col. Lawrence L. Gooch, commander of the EasternSpace and Missile Center, told reporters Tuesday.   The Delta 2 will carry two military navigation satellites on itsfirst flight Feb. 7 and the Titan 4, which will be America's mostpowerful expendable rocket, will hoist a classified payload a fewweeks later, Gooch said.   The 1989 launch schedule calls for seven military Delta 2s, twocommercial Delta 2s and one Delta 1; two Titan 4s, two smaller Titan34Ds and two commercial Titan 3s; two commercial Atlas-Centaurs andone with a Navy communications satellite; and six to eight submarinetest launches of the Navy's powerful new Trident 2 nuclear missile.   The missile center also will support seven National Aeronauticsand Space Administration space shuttle launchings during 1989,starting with Discovery on Feb. 23.   The schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since1983, when there were 60. There were 26 in 1987.   Launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold the totaldown, Gooch said. ``With luck we could support that rate, but if wecan get 70 percent up, we will have earned our pay.''   The Air Force decided to build the Delta 2 and to significantlyincrease its Titan 4 order after space shuttle Challenger explodedon Jan. 26, 1986.   The Pentagon and NASA had been phasing out unpiloted rockets andhad been putting all their launch eggs into one basket, the shuttle.The Challenger disaster convinced officials that strategy had been amistake, and they ordered expendable rockets to ensure Americanaccess to space.   Gooch estimated 40 military, commercial and NASA space payloadshave backed up as a result of the 32-month standdown after theshuttle accident and because of the Titan 34D grounding for severalmonths. About 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense,he said.   Cape Canaveral range may have problems supporting the schedule ifthere are delays in a lot of the missions, Gooch said.   A shortage of people to handle launches could be another problem,Gooch said. The colonel said he has asked the Pentagon for about 100people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operations group.</TEXT></DOC>
