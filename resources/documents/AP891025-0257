The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was off 6.35 to 2,652.87in the first half hour of trading today. But in the broader market,rising stocks held a small edge over losers.   The Dow average plummeted as much as 85 points on Tuesday beforerebounding and closing down 3.69 points at 2,659.22.   Analysts said the tone for Tuesday's market gyrations was set bytwo factors: speculation that a collapsed deal to buy UnitedAirlines parent UAL Corp. signaled a continued ebbing of thetakeover tide, and concern that a slowing economy would lead toweaker corporate profits.   On Wall Street, program trading strategies involving millions ofshares of stock helped accentuate wild declines and rebounds instock prices, some analysts said.   ``It was almost all computerized program trading that gave ustremendous violent price swings,'' said Dennis E. Jarrett, atechnical analyst for Kidder, Peabody andamp; Co. ``I don't think youcould put your finger on any underlying economic statistic.''   In other financial markets Tuesday, the dollar ended loweragainst most major currencies, moving in tandem with the stockmarket and reflecting concern from foreign investors about theshakiness of the U.S. financial markets.   But U.S. Treasury bonds posted moderate gains, with thebellwether 30-year bond up { point, or $5 per $1,000 face amount.Treasury bonds, which are guaranteed by the government, areconsidered a safe haven at times of financial instability.   Stock market observers initially attributed the downturn to thedecision late Monday by UAL to forego an employee-management buyoutfor the time being, and a surge Tuesday in computerized programselling involving stock-index futures.   In such program selling, traders using sophisticated computerprograms take advantage of minute price discrepancies betweenstock-index futures and the actual stocks on which the futurescontracts are based.   The UAL buyout group's Oct. 13 announcement that it couldn'traise financing for its $6.75 billion bid, and program selling thatfollowed, were considered key factors in the Dow's 190-point plungethat day. Stocks regained much of their losses last week, however.   ``It's certainly reminiscent of Friday the 13th ... althoughit's not a replay,'' said Hugh Johnson, chief investment officerfor First Albany Corp. in Albany.   Analysts said program trades dominated Tuesday's buying andselling.   ``I didn't see a lot of individuals, or even institutions,participating,'' said Johnson. ``By and large they seemed to befence sitting.''   Gene Jay Seagle, vice president and director of technicalresearch at Gruntal Financial Inc., said program trading wasaccelerating the current bearishness apparent in the stock market.   ``What we have here is an intermediate correction in anotherwise bull market,'' he said. ``(But) we've just seen it happenin a matter of days instead of weeks as we normally do.   ``We're getting compressed moves both on the upside and thedownside ... due to program trading.''   Johnson said the fixation on the collapse of the UAL buyoutrepresented concerns about the future of leveraged buyouts.   ``It's not the final nail in the coffin of leveraged buyouts oracquisitions, but it's pretty darn close to it,'' he said. ``TheLBO business had been the principal drive of the stock market formost of 1988 and 1989.''   Analysts also pinned the blame on the lower stock prices onweakness in the economy and its effects on corporate profits. Thoseconcerns were magnified by a government report Tuesday showing thatorders for ``big ticket'' durable goods declined 0.1 percent duringSeptember.   ``The economy's heartbeat is not very strong and that isn't goodnews for stocks,'' said A.C. Moore, director of research at ArgusResearch in New York.</TEXT></DOC>
