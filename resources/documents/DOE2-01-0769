Twoof the four bacteriochlorophylls, BChl{sub 2}, form the primary donorspecial pair and one of two bacteriopheophytins serves as the primaryacceptor. One of the extra bacteriochlorophyll molecules, BChl/sub B/,bridges the special pair donor cation and the primary acceptor bacteriopheophytinanion. The authors have investigated the cation, the triplet, and theinitial radical pair associated with the process of photoinduced chargeseparation in photosynthesis using fourier transform electron paramagneticresonance (FT-EPR), electron spin echo (ESE), reaction yield detectedmagnetic resonance (RYDMR), and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR)in protein single crystals and model compounds.</TEXT></DOC>
