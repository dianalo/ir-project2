Before the market plunged, the company estimated that more than half of its 58.4 million shares were in the hands of arbitragers betting on the company's breakup value. As Allegis stock tumbled from a high of 105 7/8, many of those holders sold, largely to meet margin calls. Last week alone, more than 23% of the company's shares changed hands as the stock skidded more than 20 points, to a low of 55 in third-market trading.    At yesterday's closing price of 71, up 9 1/2, some analysts and investors say the stock isn't far above the special dividend alone, which is to be paid from the sale of the company's non-airline assets. That view became even clearer yesterday, when Allegis announced the third big step in its restructuring: a definitive agreement to sell its Westin hotels unit for $1.35 billion, plus the assumption of $180 million of Westin debt.    First Boston, which is handling the asset sales, has indicated to analysts the dividend would be a minimum $55 a share. But some big investors expect more. They put it at more like $60 to $65 a share, and conclude that the United Airlines unit, which will remain after the dividend is paid, effectively sells at the bargain price of $6 to $11 a share.    &quot;Of any arb stock, that's probably the most secure,&quot; says an arbitrager for a New York brokerage firm who adds that he is holding his shares. He and others speculate that other, cash-strapped arbitragers used yesterday's strong rebound in the stock to sell even more shares.    Reasons for the stock's weakness go beyond the selling by arbitragers. Fears that the Westin sale would yield substantially less than expected were eased with yesterday's announcement. But there are still worries that the sale of as much as 49% of the airline's Covia/Apollo reservations unit could bring in less than previously expected because of the stock market's plunge. There are also fears that the agreement to sell Hertz could unravel and that a stand-alone United Airlines could fly into a recession after the asset sales are complete.    Nancy A. Hobor, director of investor relations for Allegis, says some arbitragers have even asked whether the check has cleared from the already completed $1.07 billion sale of the Hilton International unit. It has. Other fears may be overdone.    Both Allegis and Ford Motor say the agreement for Ford to buy Hertz is still on. And even if the $1.3 billion price seems high after the market's tumble, analysts and industry officials say Ford wants make sure Hertz remains a major showcase for its cars.    The remaining, though smaller, piece of the puzzle is the sale of as much as 49% of the Covia reservations unit. While the company's secrecy over that unit's performance makes it hard for analysts to put a value on it, Jeffrey R. Perry of Cyrus J. Lawrence pegs it at $360 million. That works out to about $6 a share for each of the 58.4 million Allegis shares.    Mr. Perry uses similar arithmetic to arrive at special dividend estimate of $60 a share. After subtracting expected taxes on the sale, he pegs the Westin proceeds at $1.2 billion, or about $20.50 a share. Hertz and Hilton, he says, each mean $1.05 billion after taxes, or a total of $36 a share. His $60-a-share special dividend estimate comes after subtracting about $2.50 a share for legal and investment banking fees.    Like other analysts and traders, Mr. Perry was too optimistic a few weeks ago, when Allegis traded over 100. That, he says, was before &quot;the world turned over.&quot; But even after revising his estimates, he thinks that United Airlines alone is worth $25 to $30 a share, and that the stock should trade at 85 to 90 &quot;after the dust settles.&quot;    Although Steve Lewins of Citicorp Asset Management uses a different method to estimate the special dividend, he reaches a similar conclusion: &quot;Even with the haze out there, it looks like you've got more value than the current stock price in the current airline market.&quot;    Of course, United Airlines would be hurt by a recession, especially if it emerges from the restructuring with a higher debt load. But it is currently the company's star performer, accounting for most of the parent's third-quarter earnings. The company said yesterday the airline continues to show improved traffic from last year.    Still, the market's erratic behavior is enough to keep some bulls on the sidelines. &quot;If I had any confidence in the market, I'd say (Allegis) is probably the biggest screaming buy in the airline industry,&quot; says an analyst for one institutional holder. &quot;But I have no confidence&quot; in the market.    ---   Allegis   (NYSE; Symbol: AEG)   Business: Airline, hotels and car rental*    Year ended Dec. 31, 1986:   Revenue: $9.20 billion   Net income: $11.6 million; 25 cents a share**    Third quarter, Sept. 30, 1987:    Per-share earnings: $1.41 vs. $2.43**    Average daily trading volume:   694,000   Common shares outstanding: 58.4 million    *Non-airline assets are being sold    **1986 figures include pretax gain of $81 million fromsale of two hotels</TEXT></DOC>
