Human Rights Commission Condemns South Africa</HEAD><DATELINE>GENEVA (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Denouncing what it called South Africa's``escalation of acts of terrorism'' against blacks, the U.N. HumanRights Commission has renewed its call for mandatory sanctionsagainst the white-led nation.   The 43-country panel, at its annual meeting Monday, urged thatSouth Africa be economically isolated.   It said children were increasingly being targeted for repression.   The United States, Britain and West Germany dissented in the36-3 vote. Belgium, France, Japan and Portugal abstained.   The resolution accuses South Africa of continuing ``gross andcruel violations of human rights'' under apartheid.   It calls for the immediate release of Nelson Mandela, imprisonedleader of the outlawed African National Congress guerrilla movementand freedom for all political prisoners in South Africa.   ``Massacres and daily killings of defenseless men, women andchildren have become the order of the day,'' the resolution says.   It says human rights violations have risen under agovernment-imposed state of emergency that went into effect in June1986, and urges the U.N. Security Council to impose mandatorysanctions on South Africa.   Separately, the commission asked all governments to immediatelycut trade, manufacturing and financial ties with South Africa andNamibia, or South-West Africa, the territory ruled by South Africain defiance of U.N. resolutions.   The vote was 32-7. The United States, Britain, Belgium, France,West Germany, Italy and Portugal opposed the draft. Spain, Ireland,Japan and Norway abstained.   On Namibia, 34 delegations voted without dissent to accuse SouthAfrica of wide-ranging oppression there and to call anew forNamibian independence. Nine Western countries abstained.   By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregatedsociety in which the 26 million blacks have no vote in nationalaffairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintainseparate districts, schools and health services.</TEXT></DOC>
