Even in their squalor, many are under constant threat ofeviction. How to deal with the squatters, and with a severenationwide housing shortage for blacks, is one of the apartheidgovernment's most difficult dilemmas.   In theory, the country's white leaders favor blackhomeownership, believing it promotes middle-class values andundercuts support for revolutionary change. In practice, thegovernment is providing only a small fraction of the land, housesand funds needed to resolve the crisis.   ``The desperate lack of homes for those in the lower incomegroups is like a time bomb,'' The Sowetan, the largestblack-oriented daily newspaper, said in a recent editorial.   Squatting and homelessness are decades-old problems in SouthAfrica, but the situation has worsened since 1986, when thegovernment abolished the so-called pass laws that restricted therights of blacks to live in urban areas.   Tens of thousands of blacks who previously feared arrest orforced removal have set up shacks on the outskirts of the bigcities, where job opportunities are better.   The population of the Mofolo squatter camp in Soweto,Johannesburg's main black township, has mushroomed to an estimated40,000 since it was established in 1986. Soweto's blackadministration charges the squatters rent but provides virtually noservices.   In Soweto and other similar townships, black local officialsoften have initiated efforts to evict squatters and demolish theirhomes.   The Black Sash civil rights group has called for a moratorium onsquatting arrests and demolitions until alternative sites areprovided.   ``These people have nowhere to live,'' said a recent Black Sashreport. ``They are not living in these illegal and hopelessconditions because they want to.''   The government professes concern about the squatters' plight,yet it is toughening anti-squatting laws.   Constitutional Development Minister Chris Heunis sayslegislation is being drafted to increase the maximum penalties forillegal squatting to a $5,000 fine or five years in jail.   He said provisions would be made to allow for compulsory,summary evictions of squatters, even those who contend that theyhave permission from a landowner.   Along with these proposals, the government has appointedplanning experts to identify white-owned land in theJohannesburg-Pretoria area that could be allocated for new blacktownships. But this endeavor is complicated by protests from whiteswho do not want large black settlements near their homes.   Weiler's Farm, one of the few squatter camps formally recognizedby the government, is due to be eliminated later this yearfollowing complaints by whites that the presence of blacks hasboosted crime and depressed property values.   ``The squatter problem is like measles _ it spreads all over,''said Koos van der Merwe, who represents the area for the far-rightConservative Party in Parliament.   Weiler's Farm, 25 miles south of Johannesburg, has grown in twoyears from 2,000 to more than 8,000 residents. They are due to bemoved in October to a site further from Johannesburg.   The government estimates South Africa's housing backlog at morethan 700,000 units. Some experts calculate that 5 million blacks,almost one in every five, are without a permanent, legal home.   It is estimated that by the year 2000, about 2 million new homeswill be needed, or more than 200,000 a year at an annual cost ofroughly $2.25 billion.   The private sector has assumed a major role in trying to reducethe housing backlog. Last year, the South African Housing Trust wasformed, with the government providing the rand equivalent of $200million on the understanding that business groups would contributetwice that amount.   But even if this program is sustained through the end of thecentury, it would supply barely one-fourth of the funds needed tomeet black housing demands.   The Housing Trust seeks to provide homes at a cost of about$7,000, to be purchased with installment payments of $58 a month.   However, experts estimate that only 25 percent of South Africa'sblacks can make a meaningful contribution toward housing costs.Most squatters, and many other blacks, earn no more than $100 amonth.   Asked if they could provide homes at less than $2,500, a costperhaps within reach for a majority of black families, officials ofthe Housing Trust reported: ``The odds are against us havingsuccess.''
