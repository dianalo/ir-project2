Even before this year's season opened, ski makers saw an insidethreat, as industry giant Salomon S.A. - a powerful force inbindings and boots - edged into the market with a new line of skis.   Combined with the slower business, it helped fuel a stir in theski industry, which is offering all sorts of bargains and high-techequipment to bring more people into the port.   Figures compiled by the ski association reflect the sluggishtimes facing the industry. In the 1989-90 season, U.S. resortsrecorded 50 million skier visits, a 6 percent drop from the yearbefore. Prior to then, skier traffic had been flat for a couple ofyears.   Officials say the situation has been more bleak in Europe, whichhas been plagued by little snowfall.   Also, the drop off at ski lift lines has had a ripple effect inthe equipment industry.   ``If fewer people are going out skiing, they will tend topurchase less equipment,'' said Marvin Kottke, a retired Universityof Connecticut economist who conducts annual studies of the skiindustry.   U.S. equipment sales increased last season by 2 percent to $675million, but industry experts say that was explained by higherprices. The number of skis sold, for example, declined by 3 percentto 1.1 million pairs.   This year, the equipment industry is bracing for another threatin the sagging U.S. economy. The economic troubles have hitparticularly hard in New England, home to many major resorts.Still, ski area operators are optimistic, saying their biggestconcern is not the economy but the weather.   At the retail level, die-hard skiers will still buy newequipment, which can cost up to several hundred dollars, said ChrisLeake, vice president of merchandising for Ski Market Ltd., whichoperates a chain of stores in the Northeast.   ``But most people are saying, `I think I'll make my boots lastanother year. I'll make my skis work another season,''' he said.   ``I think it would be crazy to think the lack of confidence inthe economy has no impact on the ski business,'' said StuartRempel, a marketing and communications executive for Salomon's U.S.headquarters in Georgetown, which is about 30 miles from Boston.   Nonetheless, Salomon, based in France, has introduced a ski thisyear that the company spent five years and $40 million to develop.Rempel said the ski has a unique design that gives skiers morecontrol and more speed.   The new line is targeted for top-level skiers, and the companyis making no concessions to what might be a tight market. Each pairof its skis will cost a whopping $595.   That high price could cause some problems, given the currenteconomic slump, Leake said.   ``Potentially, Salomon's timing is poor,'' he said, but added:``They've made a major commitment. Salomon isn't making skis forone year.''   In fact, Salomon plans to introduce a lower level ofrecreational skis next year, Rempel said. ``Our intention is to bea major force in skis,'' he said.   This strategy is not lost on other ski makers. Salomon alreadydominates the world market in bindings, with a 45 percent share,according to Rempel's estimates, and is vying for the top spot inboots.   ``If I was a competitor, I'd be nervous,'' said Ingemie at theski industries association.   Rossignol S.A., a world leader in the ski market, has come outwith its own new skis this year, which also incorporate significanttechnological improvements to make turning easier, saidJeanne-Marie Gand, a company spokeswoman.   ``You can't sit back on your laurels,'' she said, adding thatthe French company next year will introduce another ``incredible''line of skis.   Still, she said companies are working harder to make skiing a``viable activity'' for people facing tight budgets. Some resortsare offering special family rates and free skiing for beginners toattract more people.   Rossignol is working with some resorts and retailers to offercustomers free lift tickets if they buy a pair of skis.   ``We see much more of that this year,'' she said.</TEXT></DOC>
