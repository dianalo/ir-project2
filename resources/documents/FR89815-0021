Included with the regulations wasevidence that the hearing requirements of 40 CFR 51.102 had been met bythe county. Additionally, the IDNR provided an opportunity for public commentand hearing concerning the state's intent to submit the Polk County rulesas part of the Iowa SIP. Air pollution control activities in Polk County, Iowa, are a function withinthe Polk County Physical Planning Department. The county air program operatesunder a letter of agreement with the IDNR. This letter of agreement isrenewed annually. The letter of agreement authorizes the local agency to enforce its ruleswithin the city of Des Moines and Polk County. The local agency is requiredto maintain rules consistent with the state rules. The Polk County agencyacts as an agent of the state and is responsible for reviewing new sourcepermit applications following IDNR construction permit guidance. Additionally,the Polk County agency is responsible for inspections of major facilities,tracking emissions data, air quality monitoring, and compliance at majorand minor facilities within its area of jurisdiction. The revised Polk County permit rules submitted by the IDNR on February3, 1988, are the most recent revisions adopted by the Polk County Boardof Supervisors. The revisions were adopted to make the county's permitrules approvable by EPA. When approved as part of the applicable Iowa SIP,these rules would become enforceable by EPA. The revised ordinance wasadopted after the third reading of the ordinance on September 29, 1987.Two previous readings were made on September 15, 1987, and September 22,1987. The revised ordinance became effective after the third reading. Article I of the ordinance contains the definitions applicable to the countyrules. The definitions listed in section 5-2 include a glossary of abbreviations,i.e., ASME, ASTM, and Btu, as well as definitions of terms. The more significantdefinitions are discussed below. Air Pollution is defined as the presencein the atmosphere of air contaminants which are or tend to be injuriousto public health, safety, or welfare. This is approvable. The county'sdefinition of construction is a combination of EPA's definitions of ``construction''and ``modification'' found at 40 CFR 52.01 (c) and (d). This is approvable.The county's definitions of emission limitation and emission standard areidentical to EPA's definition at 40 CFR 51.100(z) and are approvable.Major stationary source is defined as one which emits or has the potentialto emit 100 tons per year of any regulated contaminant, or any physicalchange that would constitute a major stationary source. A major stationarysource of volatile organic compounds (VOC) is considered a major sourcefor ozone. This is approvable. The county's definition of particulate matter is acceptable for total suspendedparticulate matter, but should be revised to be consistent with the definitionpromulgated on July 1, 1987. EPA's definition of particulate matter isfound at 40 CFR 51.100(oo) and means airborne finely divided solid or liquidmaterial with a mean aerodynamic diameter smaller than 10 micrometers.The county's definition of start-up is consistent with the EPA regulations.The county's definition of volatile organic compound is consistent withEPA's model definition for VOC. Article II describes the duties, authority, and responsibility of the healthofficer.Article X contains permit requirements for new and modified sources. Section5-28 in Article X prohibits construction or modification of an air pollutantsource without the proper permit. Section 5-29 identifies the basic informationneeded in a permit application and makes an allowance for the health officerto request additional information that may be necessary to carry out theduties of that office. Section 5-30 provides for notification of applicantswhether or not an application is approvable. Notification must be no laterthan 60 days after application is made. The health officer is also requiredto publish a notice of intent to issue a permit to construct to a majorsource in a newspaper 30 days prior to issuing the permit. This is approvable.Section 5-31 provides for issuance of permits after the agency determinesthat the source can be reasonably expected to comply with the appropriateemission limits. The ordinance prohibits emission limits based upon stackheights which exceed good engineering practice or any other dispersiontechnique. The Polk County agency adopted the Iowa stack height regulationsby reference. EPA approved the state's stack height rules on October 24,1988 (53 FR 41600). Section 5-32 provides for denial of permit applications.Section 5-33 provides for exemption of certain sources from the permitrequirements except where permits are required under the state's preventionof significant deterioration regulations. Exempted sources include indirectheating fuel-burning equipment of less than 50 million Btu per hour heatinput which burn natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas exclusively. Fuel-burningequipment using No. 1 or No. 2 fuel oil exclusively and less than one millionBtu per hour heat input are exempted. This is approvable. Section 5-34 prohibits any county political subdivision from issuing anypermit for erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, or occupancyor any building or structure until the health officer has approved anyfuel-burning or refuse-burning device to be included in such building orstructure. Section 5-34.1 contains a schedule of fees for filing permitapplications and a review fee. An appropriate fee is charged if the countyis required to perform a modeling analysis for the applicant. This is consistentwith section 110(a)(2)(K) of the Clean Air Act, as amended. Section 5-35 provides for annually renewable permits, permit fees, andinspections. The permit fee schedule is consistent with the requirementsof section 110(a)(2)(K) of the Clean Air Act, as amended. EPA is approvingthe county's operating permit program with the provision that any permitwhich changes any requirement of the Iowa SIP, including requirements inany construction permit, must be submitted to EPA, and approved, as a SIPrevision. Section 5-39 exempts certain sources from permit requirements. These aretypically small fuel combustion sources such as gas-fired units less than50 million Btu, No. 1 or No. 2 fuel oil-burning units less than 1 millionBtu, and single- or two-family dwellings. Section 5-40 establishes a maximum time period for returning annual permitrenewal applications. Section 5-41 provides for permit denial. Section5-42 states that permits are not a license to pollute. Annual inspectionsare required by Section 5-43. Section 5-44 provides for permit suspensionswhen a source is found violating the permit terms and conditions. Reinstatementof permits is provided for in Section 5-45. The health officer is authorizedby Section 5-47 to request additional information of a source, not specificallyincluded in an application, which is needed to perform the duties of thatoffice. Section 5-48 prohibits installation of devices which are intendedto circumvent an emission limit rather than reduce actual emissions. Polk County adopted by reference state rule 567-22.5(455B), Special requirementsfor nonattainment areas, in Section 5-50.1. That regulation was adoptedby the state of Iowa to satisfy the requirements of part D of the CleanAir Act, as amended. The state's rule was approved by EPA on September12, 1985 (50 FR 37177). The county's adoption is approvable. The Polk County permit rules are not yet revised to include the particulatematter definitions promulgated by EPA on July 1, 1987 (52 FR 24634) pertainingto PM<T2>10</T2>. The state of Iowa and Polk County provided written assurancesthat the local permit rules will be revised in a manner consistent withEPA's promulgation. Under terms of the authority granted by the state,the county air program operates as an agent of the state and enforces stateregulations. The state revised its SIP in a manner consistent with EPA'sPM<T2>10</T2> promulgation of July 1, 1987. EPA is approving the state'sPM<T2>10</T2> SIP revision elsewhere in the <T4>Federal Register</T4>. Until the local agency adopts the required PM<T2>10</T2> revisions and those revisions are approved by EPA, the statewill remain responsible for approving permits relating to PM<T2>10</T2> emissions sources in Polk County.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>Action:</T2> EPA approves the Polk County, Iowa, permit regulationsubmitted by the IDNR as part of the Iowa SIP. This includes the purpose,definitions, authority, and permit requirements. EPA is approving the county'soperating permit program with the provision that any permit which changesany requirement of the Iowa SIP, including requirements in any constructionpermit, must be submitted to EPA, and approved, as a SIP revision. EPA is publishing this action without prior proposal because the Agencyviews this as a noncontroversial amendment and anticipates no adverse comments.The public should be advised that this action will be effective October16, 1989. However, if EPA receives notice within 30 days that someone wishesto make adverse or critical comments, this action will be withdrawn andtwo subsequent notices will be published prior to the effective date. Onenotice will withdraw final action and another will begin a new rulemakingby announcing a proposal of action and establishing a comment period. Ifno such comments are received, the public is advised that this action willbe effective October 16, 1989. Nothing in this action should be construed as permitting, or allowing orestablishing a precedent for any future request for revision to any SIP.Each request for revision to the SIP shall be considered separately inlight of specific technical, economic, and environmental factors and inrelation to relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. Under 5 U.S.C. 605(b), I certify that this SIP revision will not have asignificant impact on a substantial number of small entities. (See 46 FR8709.) This action has been classified as a Table 3 action by the Regional Administratorunder the procedures published in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> on January 19, 1989 (54 FR 2214-2225). On January6, 1989, the Office of Management and Budget waived Table 2 and 3 SIP revisions(54 FR 2222) from the requirements of Section 3 of Executive Order 12291for a period of two years. Under section 307(b)(1) of the Act, petitions for judicial review of thisaction must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriatecircuit within 60 days from date of publication. This action may not bechallenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements.
