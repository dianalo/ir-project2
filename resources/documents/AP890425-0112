Families from the minority Tonga tribe recently settled andplanted crops on the edges of the Chirisa game reserve in theMidlands, said Claudius Hove, the Department of National Parks andWildlife's chief warden in the province.   In past weeks, they beat tribal drums to keep stray elephantsfrom their plots. Instead, the drumbeats attracted the animals,Hove told the Zimbabwe Inter-African News Agency.   ``These people have been settling in and around the game parkand the elephants have been increasingly attracted by crops intheir fields,'' Hove said.   The settlers will be moved from the reserve and game rangerswill try to drive the stray elephants back into the park, he said.If the animals don't budge, they will be shot, he added.</TEXT></DOC>
