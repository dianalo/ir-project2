EPA issuedits Model Plan in the <T4>Federal Register</T4> of April 30, 1987 (52 FR 15820). The Model Planwas designed to provide States with a standard for developing their ownaccreditation programs. In fact, the Model Plan recommended that Statesshould consider additional requirements beyond those specified in AHERAfor certifying accredited personnel as a way of increasing the stringencyof the qualifications necessary for doing abatement work. AHERA requiredthat all States adopt an accreditation program at least as stringent asthe EPA Model Plan within l80 days after the beginning of their next legislativesession. This deadline has passed for all State legislatures.Although EPA will no longer accept training courses for review and contingentapproval for AHERA accreditation after October 15, 1989, EPA will continueto conduct full approval audits of courses contingently approved and reviewfor contingent approval and subsequent full approval courses postmarkedon or before October 15, 1989. The review and approval of new courses forAHERA accreditation will now be a responsibility of the States as was intendedin AHERA. This action will mean that decisions about asbestos abatement trainingrequirements will be made at the State level, a situation that EPA hasalways believed was the most desirable from a risk reduction standpointand also for pragmatic considerations. Under AHERA, States have discretionto determine the level of stringency of their accreditation programs aslong as they are at least as stringent as EPA's Model Plan. Because ofthe large number of asbestos abatement projects and the short-term natureof many of these projects, use of State-certified contractors and Stateoversight of projects increases the proximity of the enforcement authorityand enables tighter controls to ensure that abatement work is done properly.Since April 1987 when the proposed AHERA schools rule was issued in the<T4>Federal Register </T4>including a final Model Accreditation Plan, theAgency has moved to assure that trained abatement personnel would be availableto meet the demand generated from the enactment of AHERA and to prepareStates to take on their responsibilities under AHERA in the area of accreditation.EPA functioned in this capacity to assist States and local education agenciesthrough the critical period after the initiation of AHERA. EPA believesthat this period has ended. During this time, EPA has approved 1,362 trainingcourses and 15 State accreditation programs, of which 9 include all disciplines,to develop the nation's infrastructure of accredited inspectors, managementplanners, project designers, contractors, supervisors, and workers. Allthese courses and State programs maintain their EPA-approved label forAHERA accreditation purposes. Almost 2 years have passed since the effectivedate of the AHERA rule, the demand for accreditation courses has decreasedsomewhat, and those States which have not already done so should be preparingto meet their legal requirements under AHERA. EPA has financed and implemented several projects in addition to the ModelPlan to increase the States' capacities in this area. EPA, through theNational Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL), provided the States withmodel legislation to assist them in developing contractor certificationprograms and fee-based funding options to support these programs; awarded$2.5 million in grants to 39 States for the purpose of establishing abatementcontractor and worker certification programs; granted more than $1 millionto 17 States to help them develop inspector and management planner accreditationprograms; and, through a State Enhancement Program, plans to allot additionalfunds for State activities which will include accreditation programs. As States begin to build on the existing infrastructure of accreditation,EPA will redirect its resources to other responsibilities it has underAHERA, other concerns related to asbestos risk reduction, and State assistanceactivities. EPA will focus on: AHERA compliance efforts; enhancement andapproval of State accreditation programs; aggressive audits of approvedcourses; audits of courses with contingent approval; and continued developmentof guidance materials and the provision of technical assistance for managingasbestos in public and commercial buildings. EPA will also continue to provide assistance to States through its agreementwith NCSL and the Agency's State Enhancement initiative. NCSL has focusedon ways to improve the quality and effectiveness of State legislatures'efforts in developing programs, policies and standards to address asbestoshazards in buildings, and assuring that State legislatures will have astrong, cohesive voice in the federal system on asbestos issues. Additionally,several on-going EPA projects will be major efforts of the Agency overthe next year and a half: State enhancement activities; the developmentof a Model Reciprocity Plan in cooperation with the National Asbestos Councilto enable inter-state accreditation; and, the development of model coursesfor workers and project designers. In conclusion, EPA has recognized that it is now appropriate for the Agencyto move aside and allow the States to assume the lead in approval of trainingcourses for AHERA accreditation as the law intended. EPA will now increaseits focus on those elements of AHERA that are Federal in nature, but, willat the same time continue to provide resources and services to States forthe development of their accreditation programs.<ITAG tagnum="21">Dated: September 14, 1989.   </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="6">Charles L.
