(AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Feminists are readying a second try atratification of the Equal Rights Amendment, but this time they'llhave to do it without the help of former congresswoman MarthaGriffiths.   It was Griffiths, now Michigan's 77-year-old lieutenant governor,who stalked the halls of Congress to get the 218 signatures neededto pull the ERA out of a House committee and onto the floor fordebate, clearing the way for its eventual overwhelming approval byCongress in 1972.   But the amendment was ratified by only 35 state legislatures,three short of the number needed to add it to the U.S. Constitution.   ``I think part of the problem is that it's also associated withrights for minorities and you'd be surprised how much racism therestill is in this world,'' says Griffiths, a Democrat.   ``Another thing, some men resent tremendously the idea of a womancoming into their offices and really having a chance at promotion.''   Griffiths predicts the amendment will be ratified this century asyoung women become more aware of discrimination.   The next time around, she says, the case for the amendment shouldbe presented in economic terms. ``I never had anybody objecting tomy trying to get more money for their working wives.''   She says women themselves are partially to blame for not beingmore aggressive in seeking promotions and asking for equaltreatment. ``I think a lot of women just won't do it,'' she says.   Griffiths, now in her second four-year term as lieutenantgovernor, never displayed such reluctance when it came to fightingfor women.   Born Martha Wright in Pierce City, Mo., on Jan. 29, 1912,Griffiths is descended from a family that homesteaded in the area.   ``My father thought that girls were as smart as boys and heencouraged me,'' said Griffiths, who grew up going squirrel huntingalongside the boys, out-shooting them because of her steady hands.   She attended the University of Missouri, where she met her futurehusband, Hicks G. Griffiths. They attended the University ofMichigan law school together, graduating in 1940 as theinstitution's first married couple.   After working together for a Detroit insurance company, the twoestablished their own law firm in 1946. They worked on thesuccessful gubernatorial campaign of G. Mennen ``Soapy'' Williams in1948.   Griffiths was elected to the state Legislature and in 1952 ranfor Congress. She lost, but won the seat two years later and becamethe first woman to serve on the House Ways and Means Committee.   ``There is where you find how badly women have been treated,''she says of the tax-writing panel.   One of Griffith's early targets was Social Security, which shesaid required women to pay in as much as men but paid women andtheir children less benefits when they retired or died.   ``What kind of nonsense was that?'' she asks rhetorically.   Griffiths wrestled with the complexities of Social Security andinheritance tax laws, but her greatest achievement involved addingthe word ``sex'' to the 1964 Civil Rights Act.   The effect was to outlaw discrimination against women, blacks andmembers of other racial minorities and create the basis forcountless lawsuits.   Her amendment caught potential opponents flat-footed and itpassed before members of Congress knew what they had done.   ``It was a glorious accident,'' she says. ``It really changedAmerica.''   Feminist leaders revere her.   ``She's a legend in her own time,'' says Marian McCracken, formerpresident of the National Organization for Women and Michigan'srepresentative on NOW's national board.   ``She understood sex discrimination way before her time, waybefore other people did and tried to use her position to dosomething about it,'' says Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund fora Feminist Majority, whose goal is to elect more women to publicoffice.   Griffiths says the push for the ERA changed women's lives eventhough the amendment did not pass.   ``Scores, if not hundreds, of acts were passed at the state,local and federal level, eliminating the worst of thediscriminations,'' she says, adding that ERA opponents thought suchconcessions could blunt the drive for the amendment's passage.   Griffiths surprised the state in 1974 by deciding againstreturning to Congress after her 10th term. She said she had tired ofcommuting after two decades.   She was serving on a number of corporate boards, earning $360,000a year, when then-U.S. Rep. James Blanchard picked her to be hisrunning mate in 1982.   Critics say Griffiths is getting too old to preside over thestate Senate, where she has been known to hush noisy senators duringdebate.   ``Reagan, who just left the presidency, is a year older than I,so what are they really talking about? What they're really talkingabout is a woman. They object to a woman doing anything,'' she says.   ``That's really it. But when you put it to a vote, the peopleaccept me.''   Despite her crusty comments, Griffith has the air of agrandmother with her white hair, wrinkled face, and slow walk. Shehas grandmotherly feelings, too, carrying pictures of hersecretaries' children in her purse and lining her office halls withpaintings of children. Griffiths had no children.   ``I suppose you don't regret what you've never had, but I haveenjoyed other people's children,'' she says.   Despite her age, Griffiths keeps a heavy schedule. Once whenBlanchard's office asked for a list of her engagements since takingoffice, Griffiths' staff needed three days to compile an 80-pagelist containing 900 speeches.   Griffiths hasn't decided whether to remain on the ticket ifBlanchard runs again for governor in 1990.</TEXT><NOTE>End Adv for Sunday, March 12</NOTE></DOC>
