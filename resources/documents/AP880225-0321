William Genoese, responding to questions at a news conference,said the union was studying the possibility of leveraged buyouts orfriendly takeovers of Pan American World Airways, NorthwestAirlines and USAir.   But he characterized any employee-led buyouts as merepossibilities under the Teamsters' long-term strategy rather thanas certainties.   Also, two investment bankers mentioned by Genoese said they werenot working on any airline takeover proposals with the Teamsters.   Genoese said discussion of union-led buyouts was not a ploy, buthe conceded that ``the threat of it will help you in negotiations.''   Negotiations between Pan Am and the Teamsters, which represents4,500 Pan Am ground employees in 14 cities, over $35 million inconcessions broke down on Sunday.   Although the union had set a strike deadline for that night, itsmembers have continued reporting to work. Genoese has said a strikeremains possible and has threatened to disrupt Pan Am groundoperations.   Pan Am has said it needed a total of about $540 million inconcessions from all its unionized employees during the next threeyears to ensure its survival.   Northwest is negotiating with its flight attendants on a newcontract an faces a midnight EST Friday strike deadline. Genoesespoke at a news conference about the likelihood of a strike byNorthwest attendants, who also are represented by the Teamsters.   Genoese said he had spoken recently with experts at theinvestment firms of Salomon Brothers Inc. and Drexel BurnhamLambert Inc. about how to finance airline buyouts.   Drexel was an adviser to the coalition of four Pan Am unionsthat unsuccessfully attempted to find a buyer for the financiallytroubled airline last year, but says it has not dealt exclusivelywith the Teamsters in that regard.   Robert Salomon, a managing director of Salomon Brothers, said hewas unaware of any contact between the Teamsters and Salomonregarding airline buyouts.   Genoese also said he had spoken Monday with Jay Pritzker,chairman of Braniff Inc., about a possible joint bid for Pan Am.Braniff in January dropped a proposal to acquire major elements ofPan Am Corp., the airline's parent, after the Pan Am pilots uniondecided to oppose the plan, which called for $800 million in wageconcessions over four years from the company's unions.   Pritzker, through a spokeswoman at his Chicago office, declinedto comment.   Genoese said that by considering employee-led buyouts the unionsimply was examining the same financing techniques used by WallStreet takeover artists.   ``You can do the financial end as well as (takeover strategist)Carl Icahn and be good to the people,'' Genoese said. ``You'regoing to see some of these moves pretty soon in the papers.''</TEXT></DOC>
