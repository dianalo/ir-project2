Since grand jurors deliberate in secret, they rarely have tocontend with dozens of reporters outside their meeting room. ButWednesday was different.   Before the jurors arrived at the federal courthouse, rumors hadspread through Washington's press corps that indictments wereimminent against the major players in the Iran-Contra affair.   When independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh entered the buildingin the morning, he told reporters to stick around. That was allthey needed to hear. The vigil was on.   Dozens of reporters gathered behind rope barriers outside thenormally quiet hallway used by the jurors.   Reporters didn't know the jurors' names, but studied their faceseach time they emerged for a break, straining for signs that 14months of grueling work had ended.   ``This is it,'' someone would yell from the sometimes noisypress area, setting off a false alarm.   During six hours of on-and-off deliberations, Walsh and hisprosecutors repeatedly entered and left the jury room, setting offnew speculation that it was over.   By late morning, Walsh told reporters, ``These things can take along time.'' He didn't say what the ``things'' were. He didn't haveto.   Then, Walsh was called down to the grand jury at 3:54 p.m. EST.The jurors filed out, and their deadly serious faces sent reportersdashing to a fourth floor courtroom.   Twelve minutes later, the grand jurors and Walsh were seated inthe courtoom, and in came federal Magistrate Jean Dwyer.   ``Your honor, this is grand jury 87-4, empaneled Jan. 28,1987,'' courtroom clerk Maureen Lawrie said.   After the grand jury was polled, Ms. Lawrie said, ``Mr. Foreman,have you anything to report to the court?''   ``I do,'' said the foreman, who then handed the 101-pageindictment to the clerk.   The indictment was not read aloud.   Dwyer thanked the jurors for their service and reporters ranfrom the room like a thundering herd.   The jurors left quietly _ thankful, presumably, that their longordeal was over.</TEXT></DOC>
