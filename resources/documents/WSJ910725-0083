During the 1988campaign he pledged there would be &quot;no net loss&quot; of thenation's swamps, bogs and marshes. Under Jimmy Carter's&quot;moral equivalent of war&quot; we were faced with energy-policysocialism; with George Bush's swamp thing we're threatened bywetlands-policy socialism.   Wetlands can of course play a valuable role in containingfloods and maintaining the quality of the nation's watersupply. The problem is that not all &quot;wetlands&quot; areecologically valuable. Some are wet for only a week or so ayear. Others are glorified potholes. Nonetheless, federalbureaucrats have seized on the President's well-intentionedstatement to pursue a fanatical enforcement campaign thattreats all things wet as equal. The Environmental ProtectionAgency and the Army Corps of Engineers are turning wetlandsenforcement into national zoning and land-use direction.</LP><TEXT>   In the process, inevitably, they are engaging inuncompensated takings of someone's property. If this soundsabstract, the list of victims hosed by the wetlands police isa long one:   A nonprofit group in Juneau, Alaska, wanted to build ashelter and workshop for the handicapped, and won citypermission to use some low-lying land that was easilyaccessible. But permission to build was denied, and theproject had to wait until a private party donated anotherproperty. That parcel was just as &quot;wet&quot; as the first, butbecause it had been tilled it didn't count as a wetland.   The city of Hampton, Virginia, was forced to stopconstruction of a new educational and recreational centerafter the Corps of Engineers declared the land a wetland --even though it sits on some of the highest ground in thecity. The project has already cost $12.8 million, but nowappears to be stalled permanently.   In 1988, Irma and Joseph Phillips invested their lifesavings in a 44-acre Maryland farm. They planned to build aretirement home with the proceeds from the sale of part ofit. The Corps of Engineers said they had bought a wetland andrefused to let them build. Because the Phillipses had soldtheir home to buy the property, they soon became homeless andhad to move in with their daughter's family.   An elderly woman in Wyoming has been barred from plantinga bed of roses on her land for fear it will lead to waterpollution.   As outrageous as these cases are, it is even moredisturbing to learn that Congress has never written awetlands-protection law. The current crackdown is based on acourt ruling that the 1972 Clean Water Act protecting &quot;thenavigable waters of the United States&quot; could be interpretedto cover isolated spots of wetland miles from any waterway.   Federal regulators have extended this to mean that anyactivity that disturbs a wetland -- even if no pollutant isinvolved -- can be prosecuted under the Clean Water Act.Bernard N. Goode, the former chief wetlands regulator for theCorps of Engineers, admitted to Reason magazine that &quot;It wasnot the original intent of Congress to enact a wetlandsprotection statute, but a water quality act.&quot;   Outraged property owners have convinced the White Housethat the regulatory manual defining wetlands should berewritten. A key reform would define as &quot;wetlands&quot; only areasthat are covered or saturated with water for at least 21 daysa year, contain vegetation that can grow only in a wetenvironment and have soil of a certain type. Currently, apiece of property can be labeled a wetland if it meets onlytwo of these criteria. While this simple definition would enda lot of petty tyranny, we would go further, requiringcompensation for any change in property values from newwetlands regulation -- as indeed the courts should requireunder our 200-year-old Constitution.   Wetlands fanaticism has its defenders in the Bushadministration. Bob Grady, the author of Mr. Bush's &quot;no netloss of wetlands&quot; statement, is now an OMB associate directorworking on the new manual and seems determined to protect hisbrainstorm at all costs. EPA Director William Reilly, alongtime champion of wetlands, recently went so far as torelease EPA's version of the new wetlands manual despiteexplicit warnings it had not been cleared by theadministration. Ironically, Congress is now scrambling tofinally write a wetlands policy into law. It may wind upproviding more protection for property rights than the WhiteHouse's &quot;reforms.&quot;   Despite his concern for wetlands preservation, PresidentBush also supports an end to excesses in their regulation.&quot;You've got zealots in various levels of the bureaucracy,&quot; hecomplained to a group of journalists last year. &quot;I think wecan handle it pretty well at the top.&quot;   But the problem is that the resistance to wetlands reformbegins in the highest circles of the Bush administration. Theadministration's wetlands policy is well on its way towardbecoming a symbol of mindless and crippling central planningimposed from Washington, and changing its course may takeintervention from the top man himself.</TEXT></DOC>
