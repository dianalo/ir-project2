This intense, realistic movie about Vietnam has guts and soul.    However, the picture that drew the biggest crowds the weekend it opened is &quot;The Golden Child.&quot; This mystical-action picture has many special effects worth very little and one special effect worth a lot, and that's Eddie Murphy.    Mr. Murphy plays an investigator who finds lost children. It isn't clear whether he's a detective or a social worker, or how he gets paid, but of course that doesn't matter. He's &quot;the chosen one,&quot; targeted by an ancient Tibetan cult to track down the cult's god-child who's been kidnapped by a satanic prince.    Far Eastern hocus-pocus flies. So does lots of acrobatic karate. There is also a beautiful Tibetan mystery woman played by a non-actress. Her thespian limitations don't matter much; why she was cast is amply demonstrated when some bad guys throw water on her flimsy blouse.    Mr. Murphy fast-talks his way through this solemn adventure story. He is funny; even his weird cackle is funny. But why is this superstar, who could pick any script he wants, wasting his time on this half-baked hocus pocus?    He seems to recognize just how dumb the material is; he pokes fun at the story as it goes along. Maybe Mr. Murphy figures he shines best when he's floating above the material. It would be nice to see him tackle a story that's as good as he is.    ---   The cheeriest Christmas picture by far is &quot;Little Shop of Horrors.&quot; This musical about a plant that craves blood has a smart and snappy score -- and Steve Martin in a hilarious bit as a dentist who gives himself laughing gas as he treats his unanesthetized patients.    The picture is an adaptation of the clever Off-Broadway play that turned an old Roger Corman horror flick into a bouncy musical. Director Frank Oz hasn't much altered the stage version for the screen, though a &quot;happy&quot; ending has been tacked on.    The story takes place in a deliberately fake-looking Skid Row, and is narrated with '60s pop rock by a chorus of Supremes lookalikes. Seymour (Rick Moranis) is a nice nerd working in a down-and-out flower shop. He's in love with Audrey (Ellen Greene), a dim, darling blonde who wears tight dresses, push-up bras and squeaks instead of talks. She likes Seymour, too, but is dating the deranged dentist (Mr. Martin), an Elvis Presley lookalike and torture freak.    Seymour becomes famous when he introduces the Audrey II, an exotic plant, to the world. This hyperpituitary hybrid spurts to monstrous proportions, and soon thirsts for more blood than Seymour can squeeze from his finger. Using Four Tops' singer Levi Stubbs's voice, Audrey II booms her requests -- &quot;Feed me, Seymour!&quot; -- in rambunctious, bluesy song.    Howard Ashman's sly, campy lyrics are a delight: &quot;I know Seymour's the greatest, but I'm dating a semi-sadist,&quot; warbles Audrey. This is funny stuff.    ---   Neil Simon's &quot;Brighton Beach Memoirs&quot; -- the first of his Broadway autobiographical triology -- doesn't fare nearly so well in its transplant to the big screen.    Gene Saks, who directed the play on stage, doesn't have a clue about how to make Mr. Simon's one-liners work on film. Jonathan Silverman, who plays the young man growing up in Brooklyn who narrates the story, does an irksome imitation of Matthew Broderick, who played the role onstage.    This is an old story filled with stock Jewish characters: the overbearing mother, the weary and wise father, the sex-obsessed adolescent boy. Miscasting runs rampant. Imagine Blythe Danner as a relentless Jewish mother and you will immediately understand all that is wrong here.    ---   Quick Picks: &quot;Something Wild&quot; is a quirky romantic romp with a dark side. Melanie Griffith is appealing and unsettling, a shadowy Judy Holliday.    You can still catch &quot;Peggy Sue Got Married,&quot; Francis Coppola's lovely, heartfelt movie about a middle-aged woman who suddenly finds herself reliving her senior year of high school. Kathleen Turner is great.    For the kiddies, Disney has re-released two cartoon classics: &quot;Song of the South&quot; and &quot;The Lady and the Tramp.&quot; And there's a charming new cartoon movie from Spielberg and company: &quot;An American Tail.&quot; </TEXT></DOC>
