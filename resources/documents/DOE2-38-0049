<DOC><DOCNO> DOE2-38-0049 </DOCNO><TEXT>A characterization study of Co-Re-Sr/SiO{sub 2} catalysts, which are desirablein C{sub 2}-oxygenates synthesis, was performed to clarify both the stateof Co and the roles of Re and Sr additives, using high pressure in situFT-IR spectroscopy. Linear-CO species was present predominantly on Co/SiO{sub2} catalyst prepared from Co(NO{sub 3}){sub 2} precursor. On the otherhand, few CO species were observed on Co/SiO{sub 2} catalyst preparedfrom Co(OAc){sub 2} precursor, which indicated that cobalt ion on Co(Ac)/SiO{sub2} catalyst was not reduced to metallic state by H{sub 2} reduction ateven 450{sup 0}C. When modified with Re additive, a large amount of COspecies was observed including both linear CO and bridged-CO species.Addition of Sr to Re/Co/SiO{sub 2} catalyst suppressed the reductionof CO ion to its metallic state, and linear-CO species considerably decreased.It is supposed that Re and Sr sites contributed little to the CO conversionreaction.
