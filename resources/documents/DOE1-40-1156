Combination chemotherapy,fluorouracil, adriamycin and cyclophosphamide was administered in conjunctionwith local ultrasound and/or radiofrequency hyperthermia (H). H was appliedfor 1 hr daily x 5 days per course at 3 wk intervals aiming at a steadystate average temperature andgt;42{sup 0}C. An overall mean (M) temperatureof 44.8{sup 0}C (range 41.4-48.0) was achieved. Multiple point thermometrywas used for breast lesions (L) (M of 4 points) and 1 point for axillaryL. Each L was given a M of 15 treatments (Tx) (range 5-28), a total of415 Txs. A M volume shrinkage of 81% was observed (range 54-100), howeverin 3 the post treatment size was larger due to fat necrosis in 2 axillarymasses and post necrotic swelling in 1 breast mass. Tumor shrinkage tendedto be more along its thickness. Extended simple mastectomy was performedif feasible, including 21 TC treated Ls, 4-6 wks after the completionof Tx. Four L showed total necrosis, and minimal microscopic residuewas observed in 17. The authors conclude that TC is effective to treatbulky breast tumors. However a residual mass post TC is an inaccurateparameter to evaluate response. Moreover, fat necrosis related to H cancomplicate the clinical picture.</TEXT></DOC>
