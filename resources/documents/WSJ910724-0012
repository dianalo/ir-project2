President Bush didn't confirm published reports that theU.S. would support a temporary lifting of the United Nationsembargo to allow controlled exports of crude oil by Iraq forthe purchase of such urgently needed supplies as medicinesand food. But he did say he wouldn't permit continued U.N.sanctions to harm innocent Iraqi women and children, and aWhite House spokesman said some sales of crude oil may bepermitted for humanitarian reasons.</LP><TEXT>   Even if allowed, any resumption of oil exports by Iraqwould be limited. Although Iraq has pressed the U.N. forpermission to sell as much as $1.5 billion of oil, it isassumed that the maximum amount Iraq could export would be nomore than one million barrels a day. Iraq now produces anestimated 350,000 to 450,000 barrels of oil a day fordomestic use and for some shipments to Jordan.   Still, widespread price declines were triggered in oilmarkets yesterday in the wake of the weakening on Monday. Apossible contributor to the declines was the failure of NorthSea oil output disruptions to materialize as rumored,according to the Dow Jones International Petroleum Report.But the main catalyst appeared to be the prospect of more oilcoming into world markets from Iraq.   &quot;Clearly, the largest factor has been the reports thatIraqi oil sales might start up again,&quot; said Ann-LouiseHittle, a senior oil and gas analyst at Shearson LehmanBrothers.   In U.S. futures trading, crude oil for September deliverydropped 55 cents a barrel to settle at $21.32. October crudewas off 52 cents to $21.24 a barrel. In London, Brent blendcrude oil futures closed lower by as much as 48 cents abarrel on the International Petroleum Exchange.   In petroleum products traded on the New York MercantileExchange, August heating oil plunged 1.48 cents a gallon to57.68 cents. Gasoline also fell but not nearly as much.August gasoline dropped only a fraction of a cent to settleat 65.22 cents a gallon.   The chief reason for gasoline's relative strength was theanticipation by traders that the industry's latest weeklyreport on U.S. oil statistics would show a decline of as muchas one million barrels in inventories of the fuel. Accordingto the American Petroleum Institute report, released lateyesterday after futures trading had closed, gasolineinventories fell a further 327,000 barrels last week -- lessthan had been generally expected.   In other commodity markets yesterday:                                                                                                          GRAINS AND SOYBEANS: Grain futures prices soared as raincontinued to elude deteriorating crops in a parched swath ofthe Corn Belt. The dry area in north central Illinois andIndiana is a major corn and soybean producer. &quot;The crops inthis region have deteriorated very quickly,&quot; said Daniel W.Basse, director of market research for AgResource Co.,Chicago. &quot;In this particular region, it's actually drier thanit was during the drought of 1988.&quot; The corn contract forDecember delivery rose the daily limit of 10 cents a bushelto $2.50, while the November soybean contract climbed 29.5cents -- just shy of the daily limit -- to $5.695 a bushel.The December wheat contract rose 10.25 cents a bushel to$3.0250. The soybean crop, while more resilient than corn, isalso beginning to show deterioration in some areas from lackof rain. In many cases, the size of the soybean plants issmaller than normal, probably ruling out a record yield. Ifsoybean plants get rain, however, the crop could stillrebound strongly, analysts said.                                                                                                          PRECIOUS METALS: Silver prices weakened again, with silverfor September delivery falling 6.7 cents an ounce to $4.29.&quot;We've been saying the bullishness in silver was a little bittired and thought prices would come back down,&quot; said JeffreyChristian, managing director of CPM Group. Commodity fundsare waiting to see how low silver will go, he said. If priceshold above $4.20 to $4.24 through the rest of July andAugust, he said, the funds will return to silver. But, headded, if prices fall below that range, a fresh wave ofselling could be triggered. Mr. Christian said he is leaningtoward the view that prices will hold above the $4.20 level.Bernard Savaiko, senior metals analyst at PaineWebber, saidhe wonders whether mining companies have hedged all thesilver they had planned to when prices were higher. &quot;If not,they may start to compete with long investors {who bet theprice would rise} heading for the exits as the market goesdown,&quot; he said. If that happens, silver could suffer a swiftsell-off with prices possibly falling to $4.                                                                                                          CRB FUTURES INDEX: Fueled by the rally in grain prices,the index of 21 commodity prices has run up more than threepoints. Yesterday, the index traded as high as 213.14 beforefalling back to end at 211.93, up 2.17. Analysts noted therise was driven almost entirely by the strength in grains,primarily corn and soybeans. Because the rise wasn'tbroad-based, the index is vulnerable to a setback, an analystsaid. Mr. Savaiko of PaineWebber said even if the strength ingrains is justified, the money pouring into them is going tohave to come from somewhere else, such as other commodities.The CRB will have trouble rising above 213 to 214, hepredicted.</TEXT></DOC>
