The demonstrators lifted up a grey casket into which NAACPexecutive director Benjamin Hooks said he was imprisoning thepolicies of apartheid, segregation, hatred, discrimination, unjusttreatment and inequality.   He led the crowd in a pronouncement over the coffin, saying,``dust to dust, ashes to ashes _ apartheid you'll never riseagain!''   The coffin was placed into a white hearse as the demonstratorssang ``Oh, Freedom,'' a song from the civil rights movement.   Hooks prayed that ``those white folk in South Africa that callthemselves Christians may start acting like Christians andrecognize that they are their brother's keeper ... that we are allone blood.''   ``We come here today in the spirit of Walter White, Roy Wilkins,Martin Luther King ... to say that we won't be satisfied until thewalls of segregation, apartheid and oppression are brought low inSouth Africa,'' said the Rev. Jerry Guess, communications directorfor the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.   ``We come today praying that our own pharaoh, who sits at 1600Pennsylvania Avenue, will hear these voices (and realize that) wecannot exist in this world, half slave and half free,'' Guess said.   The group gathered at the embassy after a half-hour march inwhat was the culmination of South Africa Day at the 79th annualconvention of the NAACP.   In morning sessions of the conference, Sen.
