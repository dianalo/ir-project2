No pickup.^By JANICE FUHRMAN</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   Japan has formally asked the United States toexplain a 1965 accident in which a U.S. carrier lost a hydrogenbomb in the Pacific near a Japanese island while bound for aJapanese port, officials said Tuesday.   ``This happened in international waters so we have no right tomake a loud demand,'' said a senior Foreign Ministry official whodeclined to be named. ``We are just asking the United States togive us an explanation.''   Japanese opposition politicians and citizens' groups claim theU.S. government covered up the accident. Japan is the only countryever attacked with nuclear weapons, and popular sentiment isstrongly against nuclear arms.   The bomb was aboard an A-4 Skyhawk jet that fell off the carrierTiconderoga about 80 miles from a small island in Japan's Ryukyuchain and 200 miles east of the heavily populated island ofOkinawa, a U.S. military spokesman in Japan said.   The carrier was on its way from Vietnam to the Japanese port ofYokosuka and the plane's pilot was killed in the accident.   After a report in the current issue of Newsweek magazine raisedthe issue, Japan asked Monday for a U.S. explanation.   ``We are interested and concerned (about the details),'' theForeign Ministry official said.   Other officials said Japan's government does not know thelocation and condition of the B-43 bomb, and there had been nodiscussions with the United States about how to deal with it.   The magazine report, quoting nuclear expert William Arkin of theWashington-based Institute for Policy Studies, said the U.S. Navykept the incident secret until a 1981 Pentagon report that listedaccidents involving nuclear weapons.   But at the time of the 1981 report, the United States ``did notbring it to our attention,'' said the Foreign Ministry official.The report said only that the accident occurred 500 miles from theAsian mainland.   Arkin said there was scant danger the bomb would detonate,although the 33 pounds of plutonium in the bomb could threaten theenvironment as it deteriorates.   The Ticonderoga was on a mission that included readiness tolaunch a nuclear strike, a declassified U.S. Navy document releasedby Arkin and the environmental group Greenpeace said.   The disclosure raised the possibility that the carrier enteredYokosuka with nuclear arms, despite Japan's ban on nuclear weapons.   ``There is no doubt in my mind that U.S. ships still transitJapan with nuclear weapons aboard,'' Arkin said in Washington onMonday.   The Navy declined comment on Arkin's findings.   Opposition parties and citizens have charged that Navy shipsroutinely visit Japanese ports carrying nuclear bombs with thetacit agreement of the Japanese government.   Japan has said the United States is not permitted to bring innuclear weapons without prior consultations, and there have been nosuch consulations.   The United States refuses to confirm or deny the presence ofnuclear weapons in specific locations.   The lost one-megaton hydrogen bomb was about 70 times aspowerful as the bomb that fell on the port city of Hiroshima inAugust 1945 in the closing days of World War II, Kyodo News Servicereported.   Disclosure of the 1965 accident has stirred the ire of citizenson Okinawa, the site of one of the bloodiest battles in World WarII, and the continued presence of some 35,000 U.S. troops has ledto tensions and frequent protests over such problems as targetrange accidents.   Leaders of Okinawan citizens groups protesting nuclear armsdenounced the way the incident has been handled, news reports said.</TEXT></DOC>
