Flood warnings remained in effect along the Nooksack River andthree other rivers in northwestern Washington, with the NationalWeather Service predicting warm weather and occasionally heavy rainin the Cascade Mountains.   The worst problems were in Whatcom County, where the loss of abridge over the Nooksack cut off access to about 10,000 to 11,000people, although some could be reached overland through Canada,said Gary Myers of the county's Department of Emergency Services.   Two days of warm rain melted snow on 10,775-foot Mount Baker,filling the river's three forks.   Low pressure moving across southern Canada also brought strongand gusty winds to the eastern slopes of the Rocky Mountains inMontana and Wyoming, where high wind warnings were in effect.   Winds gusted above 100 mph at Choteau, Mont., early Friday, upto 72 mph at Cutbank and 61 mph at Cody, Wyo.   Mild temperatures prevailed in the Pacific Northwest.
