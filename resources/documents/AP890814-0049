More than a billion people will have a chance to watch as themoon appears to be slowly nibbled away, changing from the normalbright reflected light of a full moon into the colorful glow ofeclipse.   The celestial show starts at 8:23 p.m. EDT over the UnitedStates and will end about 5{ hours later. The eastern United Stateswill get the best viewing and Alaska will miss the eclipsealtogether.   Visible eclipse phases will vary for the central and westernparts of the country because of the difference in sunset andmoonrise. In Los Angeles, for instance, the eclipse will havestarted before the sun has set or the moon has risen. By the timethe sky has darkened completely in California, the moon willalready be in the deepest part of its eclipse. For Seattle, themoon will still be below the horizon at mid-eclipse, but will riseduring the totality phase.   Clouds, of course, could ruin the viewing at any location.   With clear skies, though, some phase of the celestial spectacleshould be visible to observers in North and South America, westernEurope and Africa, and the Antarctic. Sailors at sea in theAtlantic and in the eastern Pacific Ocean also will be able to seepart of the eclipse, weather permitting.   A lunar eclipse occurs when the moon passes through the shadowcreated by the Earth blocking the sun's light. The moon, in itsorbit of the Earth, usually passes above or below this shadowline,but every few years it follows a path that puts it completely inshade for a time. When the whole moon passes through the shadow, itis called a total eclipse.   The last total lunar eclipse visible over most of North Americaoccurred in December 1982, and the next one is not until December1992.   Astronomers are forecasting that Wednesday's eclipse may be abright one.   The moon can appear during an eclipse to be a bright coppery redif there is clear, clean air between the lunar surface and theobserver on Earth. If smoke or dust obscure the view, the moon willdiminish to an orange color or perhaps even fade from viewaltogether.   Volcanic eruptions historically have dimmed eclipse viewing bydumping tons of dust into the atmosphere. But astronomers sayenough time has passed since the last major volcanic eruption thatmost dust has settled.   The eclipse starts when the moon enters what is called thepenumbra. This outer fringe of the Earth's shadow will show up onthe moon as a grayish shading. After about half an hour, the moonwill edge into the umbra, the dark, central part of the shadow.Total eclipse, when all of the moon is covered by the umbra, willbegin at about 10:20 p.m. EDT and last for one hour, 36 minutes.   When the moon leaves the umbra, the events will occur in reverseorder. The eclipse ends about 1:53 a.m. EDT when the moon edges outof the shadow altogether.   While a lunar eclipse occurs when the Earth blocks sunlight fromthe moon, a solar eclipse is caused when the moon blocks sunlightfrom the Earth.   To experts, a solar eclipse is more interesting because itpermits unique measurements of the sun.   ``Solar eclipses attract a lot of scientific attention,'' saidJohn Bangert, a U.S. Naval Observatory astronomer in Washington.``A lunar eclipse is just a good show.''   Here is when the various phases of the eclipse will occur. Alltimes are Eastern daylight.   Moon enters penumbra: 8:23 p.m.   Moon enters umbra: 9:21 p.m.   Moon enters totality: 10:20 p.m.   Middle of Eclipse: 11:08 p.m.   Moon leaves totality: 11:56 p.m.   Moon leaves umbra: 12:56 a.m., Thursday.   Moon leaves penumbra: 1:53 a.m.   Because of the differences in sunset and moonrise times, viewingwill start at different eclipse phases in the western parts of thecountry.   Here are times for the local events that affect eclipse viewing.The first hour is for local sunset and the second is for localmoonrise. The best viewing will follow twilight which ends about 25minutes after sunset. Local time zones apply in all cases:   Baltimore: Sunset at 8 p.m. Moonrise at 7:53 p.m.   Boston: 7:43 p.m. and 7:36 p.m.   Chicago: 7:49 p.m. and 7:43 p.m.   Cleveland: 8:25 p.m. and 8:18 p.m.   Houston: 8:01 p.m. and 7:55 p.m.   Kansas City, Mo.: 8:12 p.m. and 8:06 p.m.   Los Angeles: 7:39 p.m. and 7:35 p.m.   Philadelphia: 7:56 p.m. and 7:48 p.m.   Salt Lake City: 8:24 p.m. and 8:20 p.m.   San Francisco: 8:01 p.m. and 7:58 p.m.   Seattle: 8:20 p.m. and 8:16 p.m.   St. Louis: 7:54 p.m. and 7:47 p.m.   Washington: 8:01 p.m. and 7:54 p.m.</TEXT></DOC>
