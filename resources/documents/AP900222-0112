SCHMID</BYLINE><BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE><DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE><TEXT>   The familiar figure of Ronald Reagan flickeredacross television screens in a pair of federal courtrooms Thursdaybefore one of his smallest audiences ever.   Several dozen reporters _ enough to pack one courtroom at onepoint _ watched and listened, took notes, drifted in and out.   The occasion was the first showing of the former president'svideotaped testimony, taken last weekend and intended for use inthe Iran-Contra trial of his one-time national security adviser,John Poindexter.   Reagan testified about Iran and about the Nicaraguan Contras,about former aides Poindexter and Oliver North, about weapons andabout hostages. But, perhaps most strikingly, he testified over andover during eight hours of questioning about how much he didn'tremember.   ``I don't recall that,'' Reagan responded when asked about theTower investigative commission's report that North and the NationalSecurity Council were involved in aiding the Nicaraguan rebels.   When lawyers read him that part of the commission report, Reagancontinued to deny recollection, saying his interest had been inother findings.   He was asked about American contacts with Iranian dissidents whohe had hoped were in a position to form a government to succeed theAyatollah Khomeini.   ``I can't recall the dates,'' he said.   When he was hospitalized for cancer, did government officialscome to Bethesda Naval Hospital to inform him of negotiations?   ``I recall I had visits at the hospital. I have to tell you, Ican't recall just what they were all about,'' he responded.   Looking relaxed, Reagan allowed an occasional smile to cross hislips, and chuckled once when lawyers began arguing about a question.   Another time he thanked the judge for interceding duringquestions about his having quoted Abraham Lincoln. Through a smile,Reagan remarked that such questions just increase the jokes abouthis age.   But again and again _ indeed 10 times in one 30-minute stretch _Reagan said he didn't recall events.   Was he ever told that it would be better to have Israel handlethe delivery of missiles to Iran?   ``No, I don't recall that.''   Did he recall being told that private individuals were involved?   ``No, I don't.''   Did he know the details of providing spare parts for Hawkmissiles for Iran?   ``I just don't recall.''   Had he ever discussed with Poindexter what to say if the storycame out?   ``I don't recall, I don't recall that.''   Did he meet with Poindexter between two news conferences inNovember 1986.   ``I don't recall.''   When he met with congressional leaders, was Poindexter present?   ``I don't recall.''   Did he remember when he was informed of the Hawk missileshipment.   ``I actually don't. I don't recall when I was told or who toldme.''   Was that information given to him in Geneva, when he waspreparing for a meeting with Soviet President Gorbachev?   ``I don't have a clear recollection of what was discussed. Therewere so many meetings in so many different places.''   In the courtroom of Judge Harold Greene, hours of tapedtestimony ground on, starting before a packed house that eventuallydwindled to a handful.   Across the hall a couple dozen reporters drifted in an out ofJudge Louis Oberdorfer's courtroom, where they were allowed to seeexcerpts they had requested.</TEXT></DOC>
