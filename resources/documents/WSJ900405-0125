At a court hearing, Judge Tina Brozman awarded five of thechain's 16 stores to a group led by developers Donald Trump,Alfred Taubman, Phil Palevsky, and Pyramid Cos., for about$21 million.</LP><TEXT>   Three of those stores will be liquidated, as will eightothers around the country, putting most of the chain's 1,800employees out of work. Late last year, Bonwit's sister chain,B. Altman andamp; Co., was entirely liquidated. The two chains'parent, L.J. Hooker Corp., filed for bankruptcy lawprotection last summer.   Pyramid, a Syracuse-based mall developer, will operate theBonwit Teller stores in Buffalo and Boston and has acquiredthe rights to the Bonwit Teller name. In an interview, asenior Pyramid executive said that Pyramid intends to open anew Bonwit Teller store this fall in Syracuse. He estimatedPyramid's cost at $8.2 million plus the assumption of certainemployee liabilities.   Mr. Trump has acquired the lease to the Bonwit Tellerflagship at Trump Tower in New York for about $5 million. Inan interview, he said he intends to close the store and leaseit to at least two new tenants. Possible tenants includeChanel Inc. and Tiffany andamp; Co., he said.   &quot;We wanted the lease back because it has another 14 yearsto run,&quot; said Mr. Trump. &quot;I'm very happy, and I have nodoubts we'll be able to attract several prestigiousretailers.&quot;   Mr. Trump said that Mr. Taubman bought back the lease tothe Bonwit Teller store at the Mall at Short Hills, which isbased in Short Hills, N.J., and that Mr. Palevsky bought thelease to the Bonwit Teller branch in Manhasset, L.I. Bothstores also will be closed.   Judge Brozman awarded the Bonwit Teller store in PalmBeach to Frances Brewster, a southeast Florida specialtyretailer that currently operates four stores. FrancesBrewster will operate the Bonwit Teller store under its ownname.   &quot;We're very pleased that the name will go on, but we'requite disappointed that it won't be in more locations,&quot; saidElayne Garofolo, senior vice president of marketing at BonwitTeller. &quot;The employees are taking it as well as one wouldexpect. They are being professional.&quot;   An attorney for L.J. Hooker said in court yesterday thatformer Bonwit Teller President William Ruben had indicated hewas attempting to arrange financing to buy l3 stores.However, Mr. Ruben didn't make a formal bid, and JudgeBrozman moved the case forward.   &quot;We should have had more opportunity to save thisbusiness, because we had the financing,&quot; said Irwin M.Rosenthal, a senior partner at Baer, Marks andamp; Upham, and anattorney for Mr. Ruben and his group of investors. &quot;If theywould have given us another hour, we could have saved thecompany and the jobs of its employees. It's tragic and atravesty of justice.&quot;   One of the country's oldest retailers, Bonwit Teller wasfounded in 1898 and soon became one of New York's mostfashionable stores. Its former flagship on Fifth Avenue,since demolished, was for years a Manhattan landmark. BonwitTeller had losses of approximately $30 million over the pastthree years, according to a spokesman for L.J. Hooker.Although it appeared to be turning around, it foundered lastspring when L.J. Hooker stopped providing it with cash fornew merchandise.   In addition to Boston and Buffalo, two other Bonwit Tellerbranches will continue to operate, at least temporarily. L.J.Hooker has reached a licensing agreement with Pyramid thatwill allow it to operate stores in Hooker-owned malls inCincinnati and Columbia, S.C., under the Bonwit Teller name.But L.J. Hooker currently is trying to sell the two stores.   L.J. Hooker is owned by Sydney-based Hooker Corp., whichis being managed by a court-appointed provisional liquidator.</TEXT></DOC>
