Background</ITAG>Section 1842(b)(3) of the Social Security Act (the Act) requires that allpayments under Part B of the Medicare program must be reasonable.Reasonable charge determinations under Part B generally are based on customaryand prevailing charges derived from historic charge data. The reasonablecharge for a service is generally the lowest of (1) the actual charge,(2) the customary charge made by a particular supplier, or (3) the prevailingcharge, which is set at the 75th percentile in the range of customary chargesfor similar services in the locality. For nonphysician medical services,the reasonable charge is the lowest of four factors. These include thethree factors cited above and an inflation-indexed charge. An economicindex limits the annual increases in prevailing charges for physicians'services.This standard method of determining the reasonable charge for a servicecan, in some instances, result in payments that may not be reasonable.This may occur, for example when (1) the marketplace is not truly competitivebecause of a limited number of suppliers; (2) the Medicare and Medicaidprograms are the primary source of payment for a service; (3) the chargeinvolves the use of new, expensive technology for which there is not anextensive charge history; (4) the charges do not reflect changing technologyor increased facility with that technology (for example, when first done,a medical procedure may require considerable skill and entail substantialrisk, but becomes more routine with additional experience); (5) prevailingcharges in a locality are clearly out-of-line with prevailing charges inother localities; or (6) charges are grossly in excess of acquisition orproduction costs.In recognition of these circumstances, a new section 1842(b)(8) was addedto the Act through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of1985 (COBRA) (Pub. L. 99-272, enacted April 7, 1986). Section 1842(b)(8)requires that the Secretary describe in regulations the factors to be usedin determining the cases in which the application of the reasonable chargemethodology results in a charge that is grossly excessive or grossly deficient.It also requires the Secretary to provide in regulations the factors tobe considered in those cases in establishing a reasonable charge that isrealistic and equitable.To implement the statute, we published, on August 11, 1986, a final rulewith a 60-day public comment period (51 FR 28710). The final rule amended42 CFR 405.502 that sets forth the criteria to be used in determining reasonablecharges. In accordance with section 1842(b)(8) of the Act, we specifiedin the final rule the circumstances under which HCFA or its Medicare PartB carriers will consider establishing special reasonable charge paymentlimits for services (including supplies and equipment) reimbursed underPart B of the Medicare program. The rule also described the factors thatHCFA or a carrier will consider and the procedures it will follow in establishingthe limits. The limits would be either an upper limit to correct a grosslyexcessive charge or a lower limit to correct a grossly deficient charge.In either case, the limit would be either a specific dollar amount or aspecial method to be used in determining the reasonable charges allowedfor a particular service or category of service.Subsequent to the publication of the final rule, section 9333 of the OmnibusBudget Reconciliation Act of 1986 (OBRA) (Pub. L. 99-509) was enacted (October21, 1986). Section 9333 amended section 1842(b)(8) of the Act and addednew paragraphs (9) and (10). As amended, the law specifies the distinctprocedures under which the Secretary may establish special reasonable chargelimits for physicians' services. It also provides for a limitation to theamount that nonparticipating physicians may charge for a service if a specialreasonable charge limit is established for that physician service. Thischarge limitation is scheduled to expire for services furnished after theearlier of December 31, 1990 or one year after the date that the Secretaryreports to Congress on the development of a relative scale for physicians'services.We believe that the provision concerning special reasonable charge limitsfor physicians' services requires conforming changes to the regulationsand, therefore, we are setting forth these changes below. However, becausethe regulations follow the law very closely, and we have not exercisedour discretion in interpreting the law, we are not publishing a prior noticewith opportunity to comment. This is consistent with the AdministrativeProcedure Act (5 U.S.C. 553(b)) which does not require notice and opportunityfor public comment for ``interpretative rules''. We believe that theserules are interpretative because they merely reiterate the explicit statutoryobligations and are grounded firmly in statutory language.We are not developing implementing regulations on the provision concerningthe limitation to the amount that nonparticipating physicians may chargefor a service if a special reasonable charge limit is established for thatphysician service in view of the fact that the provision is time limited,and we consider it to be self-implementing. The methodology for establishingthe limitation on nonparticipating physicians' charges set forth in thestatute is very precise, and we believe that no regulations are requiredto interpret the provision.The provisions of the August 11, 1986, final rule, the comments we received,our responses to those comments, and the changes we are making to conformthe regulations to the new provisions of sections 1842(b) (8) and (9) ofthe Act are discussed below.<ITAG tagnum="84">II. Provisions of the August 11, 1986, Final Rule</ITAG>In the August 11, 1986 final rule, we revised andSection; 405.502(a)(7) thatdescribes the use of ``other factors'', rather than the standard methodology,in making a determination of inherent reasonableness. We clarified thatthe other factors which may be considered include the special reasonablecharge limits that we described in a new paragraph (g) of andSection; 405.502.Under andSection; 405.502(g), we specified that HCFA or its Medicare PartB carriers may establish reasonable charge limits for a category of serviceif it determines that the standard procedures for calculating reasonablecharges result in grossly deficient or excessive charges.<ITAG tagnum="21">(<T4>Note</T4>._A category of service might contain only one particularservice.)</ITAG></ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">We specified that the special limit on the reasonable charge is anupper limit to correct a grossly excessive charge or a lower limit to correcta grossly deficient charge.Under paragraph (g), we described examples of the circumstances in whichthe application of the reasonable charge methodology results in eithergrossly excessive or deficient charges and under which HCFA or a carriermay determine the need for a special limit. We also specified the factorsthat HCFA or a carrier will consider in establishing the special limit.The final rule specified that we will publish any proposed national limitas a notice in the <T4>Federal Register </T4>and provide an opportunity for public comments.Then, we will publish our response to those comments and our final determinationin the <T4>Federal Register. </T4>The rule provided that each notice publishedin the <T4>Federal Register </T4>also will set forth the criteria and circumstances,if any, under which a carrier may grant an exception to the specific limit.Thus, beneficiaries and suppliers may request an exception to the limitif the criteria and circumstances for an exception, issued with the noticeof the limit, are met.We also specified that when carriers propose to use their authority tomake inherent reasonableness determinations, they must inform the affectedsuppliers or physicians of the factors considered in establishing the limitand solicit comments. The rule provided that after evaluating the commentsreceived, the carrier must inform the affected suppliers or physiciansof any final limit established. We stated that the limit will be effectivefor services furnished no fewer than 30 days after the date of the carrier'snotification.<ITAG tagnum="84">III. Discussion of Comments</ITAG>The August 11 final rule invited comments only on the material that concernsreasonable charge amounts that are deficient and special limits set bycarriers. We received 11 timely items of correspondence. The comments werefrom one individual physician, one national association representing beneficiaries,one Medicare carrier, one State Medicaid agency, and State and nationalassociations representing health care professionals. The specific commentsand our responses to these comments follows:<T3>Comment</T3>: Several commenters suggested that it was not the intentof Congress to give the Secretary or HCFA legislative authority to setnational reasonable charge limits.<T3>Response: </T3>As we explained in detail in the August 11, 1986, finalrule, we believe that the regulations are completely consistent with HCFA'sstatutory authority.<T3>Comment</T3>: Several commenters expressed concern that the regulationwill ultimately reduce the level of care to Medicare beneficiaries.<T3>Response</T3>: We do not belive that this regulation, which reflectscongressional intent to establish a framework for setting special reasonablecharge limits for health care, will constitute a lesser commitment to qualityhealth services. The purpose of this regulation is to assure reasonablecharges for physicians' services. We believe the industry will continueto provide needed care as long as Medicare charge screens are reasonable.<T3>Comment</T3>: Several commenters expressed concern that the sectionof the final rule on ``grossly deficient charges'' is too restrictive andprejudices any determination relative to raising a deficient charge level.Specific concern was expressed about the statement in the preamble to theFebruary 18, 1986, proposed rule (51 FR 5726) that situations in whichcharges are grossly deficient are virtually non-existent.<T3>Response</T3>: This comment has been overcome by subsequent events.Section 9333 of OBRA of 1986 added section 1842(b)(8)(B) to the Act. Thatsection sets forth specific factors to be used in determining cases inwhich a reasonable charge amount for a physician service is not inherentlyreasonable by reason of its grossly excessive or grossly deficient amount.In view of the statutory change, which applies the list of factors forgrossly excessive and deficient charges, we have modified the August 11,1986, final rule to provide identical criteria and factors to be consideredin determining whether a charge is grossly excessive or grossly deficientand in establishing a limit. We have made this change for physician andnonphysician services, although the statute prescribes these factors onlyfor physician services.<T3>Comment</T3>: One commenter recommended that we consider the followingadditional circumstances in determining whether a charge is grossly deficient:andbullet; Cases in which payment levels do not appropriately reflect theresource requirements (time, complexity, risk, overhead and productioncosts) required to provide the service.andbullet; Cases in which Medicare's approved amount is at a level that isbelow, equal to, or nominally above the overhead costs associated withproviding a service.</ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10">In reference to the first circumstance, the commenter indicated that,unlike most procedural services, time and complexity often are the mostimportant factors in evaluating the appropriateness of payment levels foroffice and home visits.The commenter also recommended that the factors to be used in establishinglower limits for grossly deficient charges should be expanded to include:andbullet; Differences in resource requirements_HCFA or a carrier shouldconsider differences between services in resource requirements in establishinglower and upper limits.andbullet; Overhead data_HCFA or a carrier should establish lower prevailingcharge limits for services to bring reimbursement up to a level that providesa fair return for services currently priced at a level that is below, equalto, or only nominally above average overhead costs required to performthe service.<T3>Response:</T3> This rule implements a provision of the statute thatrequires consideration of resource requirements and cost data in determiningwhether a charge is either grossly excessive or grossly deficient and inestablishing an actual limit. Furthermore, we have specifically added a``catch-all'' category for other relevant factors that would encompassthose enumerated by the commenter. Both of these provisions are locatedin this final rule at andSection; 405.502(h)(4)(ii). Additionally, we arerevising this rule at andSection; 405.502(g)(2)(iii) to clarify that in consideringcosts for the purpose of establishing a limit, HCFA or a carrier may considerresource costs as well as acquisition and production costs.While we have essentially accepted the comments offered, we want to makeit clear that we do not believe that the underlying law was intended toalter any historical imbalance in charging practices that may exist between``cognitive'' and ``procedural'' services, nor do we intend to use theseregulations as a means to do so. Achieving this would probably requirea major legislative overhaul of payment levels for physician services andwould require development of a relative value scale (RVS) reflecting thetime, complexity, risk, etc., for various services. We believe that Congressintended for the Secretary to use this authority to establish limits orgrossly excessive or grossly deficient charges in a much more selectivemanner and not as a means of making sweeping and fundamental changes inthe reasonable charge payment system. This view is supported by section1845(e)(3) of the Act that expressly requires the Secretary to developa resource-cost-based RVS and to report to the Congress on recommendationsfor the application of the scale by July 1, 1989.In addition, we have received correspondence indicating that the natureand contents of some services (as described by HCFA's Common ProcedureCoding System) has changed over time by the introduction and inclusionof new and/or additional services that previously were billed, coded andreimbursed as separate services or not provided at all. Because of thesechanges, it was suggested that physicians and other interested individualsbe able to produce evidence that a service is paid at a grossly deficientlevel because it is no longer the same service upon which the historicalreasonable charges are based. It is our judgment that this situation iscovered by the following circumstances and factors enumerated in thesefinal regulations:andbullet; In making a determination that excessive or deficient chargesexist, HCFA or a carrier may consider circumstances in which the chargesdo not reflect changing technology, increased facility with that technology,or changes in acquisition, production or supplier costs (andSection; 405.502(g)(1)(iv)).andbullet; In establishing a special limit, HCFA or a carrier may considerresources (overhead, time, acquisition or production costs, complexity)required to produce a service or product (andSection; 405.502(g)(2)(iii)).andbullet; In making a determination that excessive or deficient chargesexist or in establishing a special limit, HCFA may make a comparison betweenthe charges for a service and the resource costs of the service over aperiod of time (andSection; 405.502(h)(4)(ii)(B)).<T3>Comment: </T3>Another commenter suggested that ambulance services shouldbe excluded from inherent reasonableness determinations because some ambulancecompanies receive government subsidies that enable them to set chargesso low that nonsubsidized companies cannot compete with them.<T3>Response:</T3> We believe that the concept of inherent reasonablenessis applicable to all services. How special limits are to be applied ina given circumstance can be addressed only in the context of a specificproposal. This is why we structured the regulations to include a noticeand comment process for each proposed special limit.<T3>Comment: </T3>One State Medicaid agency expressed concern that whenMedicare carriers propose special limits, 30 days advance notice and commentperiod would be provided to affected physicians and suppliers but not toMedicaid agencies or their agents. Since some States use the Medicare reasonablecharge in their Medicaid programs, it was suggested that any State Medicaidagency in a carrier's service area be given 30 days advance notice whenspecial reasonable charge limits are proposed.<T3>Response: </T3>We are revising the regulations to provide State Medicaidagencies with advance notice and the opportunity to comment on any speciallimit proposed by a carrier. The regulations also will require the carriersto provide the agencies with advance notice of any final limit established.These changes are found at andSection; 405.502(g)(3) of this final rule.<ITAG tagnum="84">IV. Provisions of this Final Rule </ITAG>In order to respond to the public comments received, and to make the August11, 1986 final rule conform to sections 1842(b) (8) and (9) of the Act,we are making the following additional changes as well as revising theparagraph headings within andSection; 405.502 to more accurately reflectthe contents of those paragraphs. We are revising the regulations so that the list of circumstances thatmay result in grossly excessive charges will apply to grossly deficientcharges as well. Thus, we are deleting the list of circumstances relatingto grossly deficient charges at andSection; 405.502(g)(1)(ii) and are settingforth one list at andSection; 405.502(g)(1) that pertains to both grosslydeficient and excessive charges. We are revising andSection; 405.502(g)(1) to specify that HCFA's determinationmay apply to the services of any suppliers; however, a carrier's determinationmay apply only to nonphysician services. This is because section 1842(b)(9)(A)(ii)of the Act requires the Secretary to publish in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> a notice of any proposed limit on reasonablecharges for physicians' services. Since our Medicare carriers have littleexperience in this area and there is no procedure in place by which thecarriers can publish notices in the<T4> Federal Register</T4>, it would be administratively burdensome forthe Department to handle all the proposals for reasonable charge limitsfrom all of Medicare's carriers. Thus, we have decided that HCFA, not thecarriers, will be responsible for establishing the limits on reasonablecharges for physicians' services. This means that any limit on reasonablecharges for physicians' services will be national in scope. We are revising andSection; 405.502(g)(1) further to incorporate the provisionsof section 1842(b)(8)(B)(ii) of the Act, added by OBRA. Section 1842(b)(8)(B)(ii)of the Act specifies factors that the Secretary will use in determiningcases in which the standard rules for calculating reasonable charges forphysicians' services result in grossly excessive or deficient charges.Although the statute specifies that these factors are to be used in determinationsinvolving physicians' services, the factors are essentially the same asthe examples currently listed at andSection; 405.502(g)(1) that could resultin a determination of a grossly excessive charge for any supplier. Thus,we decided to continue to apply the factors at paragraph (g)(1) to allsuppliers, including physicians. In order to conform the regulations moreclosely to the statute, we are revising the language of some of the currentfactors and adding two additional factors specified in the statute. Thetwo new factors that we are adding follow: andbullet; There have been increases in charges for a service that cannotbe explained by inflation or technology. andbullet; The prevailing charges for a service are substantially higheror lower than the payments made for the service by other purchasers inthe same locality. We are revising the regulations at andSection; 405.502(g)(2)(iii) to clarifythat in considering costs for the purpose of establishing a limit, HCFAor a carrier may consider the resource costs (overhead, time, complexity,etc.) required to produce a service or a supply. We are redesignating andSection; 405.502(g) (3) and (4), which concern givingpublic notice for both the national limits set by HCFA and the carrierlevel limits, as andSection; 405.502(g)(3) (i) and (ii) respectively. Weare adding a new andSection; 405.502(h)(5) concerning HCFA's public noticefor limits applying to physicians' services. Carriers will not be establishing limits on the reasonable charges forphysicians' services. Thus, we are revising the current andSection; 405.502(g)(4)(which we are redesignating as andSection; 405.502(g)(3)) to delete the referencesto physicians in the provisions that require the carrier to: (1) Informany affected suppliers or physicians of the factor considered in establishinga limit and solicit comments; and (2) inform the affected suppliers orphysicians of any limit established. Also, we are revising the regulationsat andSection; 405.502(g)(4) (andSection; 405.502(g)(3) of this final rule)to specify that in addition to the affected suppliers, the carrier mustinform State Medicaid agencies of any proposed or final special reasonablecharge limits. Carriers also will be required to solicit comments fromthe State agencies on proposed limits. We also are adding a new andSection; 405.502(h) to set forth special rulesthat apply to physican services. In accordance with section 1842(b)(8)(C)of the Act, we are including language at andSection; 405.502(h)(1) to specifythat in determining whether to set a special reasonable charge limit fora category of physician service, HCFA also will consider the potentialimpact of the limit. This rule states, as does the statute, that HCFA willconsider the potential impact on quality, access, beneficiary liability,assignment rates, reasonable charge reductions on unassigned claims, andparticipation rates of physicians. At andSection; 405.502(h)(2), we are adding provisions that reflect section1842(b)(9)(A) of the Act concerning physician consultation. Under theseprovisions, HCFA will consult with representatives of the physicians likelyto be affected by any change in the reasonable charge before making a determinationthat a charge is not inherently reasonable by reason of its grossly excessiveor deficient amount.At andSection; 405.502(h)(3), we are adding provisions that reflect section1842(b)(8)(B)(v) of the Act that requires that if special limits are establishedbased on a comparison of prevailing charges in other localities, an adjustmentmay be made only if differences in practice costs have been taken intoaccount. At andSection; 405.502(h)(4), we are including additional factors that mustbe considered when establishing a limit on physicians' services. Specifically,we are including at andSection; 405.502(h)(4)(i) a paragraph to incorporatethe provisions of section 1842(b)(8)(B)(iv) of the Act. As specified inthe statute, these revised regulations state that regional differencesin fees will be taken into account in establishing a special limit unlessthere is substantial economic justification for a uniform fee or a uniformpayment limit. We are adding a new andSection; 405.502(h)(4)(ii) to reflect the provisionsof section 1842(b)(8)(B)(iii) of the Act that permit the Secretary to comparecertain factors when establishing a limit. Thus, these final regulationsprovide that, in establishing the specific dollar amount or special methodof the limit to be applied, HCFA may compare the charges for a categoryof service to the_ andbullet; Resource costs (for instance, in cases concerning physician services,factors such as the time required to provide a procedure, including pre-procedureevaluation and post-procedure follow-up; the complexity of the procedure;the training required to perform the procedure; and the risk involved inthe procedure) for related services; andbullet; Resource costs for the service over a period of time; andbullet; Charges for the service in different geographic areas; andbullet; Payments for the service allowed under Medicare Part B and byother payors; and andbullet; Other relevant factors. We are adding a new andSection; 405.502(h)(5) and giving it the title, ``Publicationof national limits'', and are incorporating into that paragraph the provisionsof sections 1842(b)(9)(A)(ii), (B), (C), and (E) of the Act that concerngiving notice when setting a special limit on the reasonble charge fora physician service. Section 1842(b)(9)(A)(ii) of the Act specificallyrequires the Secretary to publish a notice in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> of any proposal to set a limit on the reasonablecharges for physicians' services. Sections 1842(b)(9) (B), (C), and (E)of the Act set forth the procedures for giving that notice. In accordance with the statute at sections 1842(b)(9)(B) and (C) of theAct, these revised regulations state that the proposed notice that HCFAwill publish in the<T4> Federal Register</T4> will_ andbullet; Specify the proposed charge or method to be used to determinethe charge with respect to a service; andbullet; Explain the factors and data that HCFA took into account in determiningthe charge or method to be used; andbullet; Explain the potential impacts; and andbullet; Allow no less than 60 days for public comment on the proposal.The proposed notice, as well as the final notice, also will include theeconomic justification for a uniform fee or payment limit if it is proposedor established. The requirement that the proposal contain this informationis found in the Act at section 1842(b)(8)(B)(iv) and the requirement concerningthe final notice is found in section 1842(b)(9)(E) of the Act. In accordance with section 1842(b)(9)(E) of the Act, these regulationsrequire that the final notice will_ andbullet; Explain the factors and data that HCFA took into consideration;and andbullet; Respond to the public comments and any comments made by the PhysicianPayment Review Commission described in section 1842 of the Act. <ITAG tagnum="84">V. Regulatory Impact Statement </ITAG>Executive Order (E.O.) 12291 requires us to prepare and publish a finalregulatory impact analysis for any final regulation that meets one of theE.O. criteria for a ``major rule''; that is, that would be likely to resultin: An annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more; a major increasein costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State,or local government agencies, or geographic regions; or significant adverseeffects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation,or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-basedenterprises in domestic or export markets. In addition, we generally prepare a final regulatory flexibility analysisthat is consistent with the Regulatory Flexibility Act (RFA) (5 U.S.C.601 through 612), unless the Secretary certifies that a final regulationwill not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number ofsmall entities. For purposes of the RFA, we treat all physicians and othersuppliers of medical services as small entities. Since these regulations are required by sections 1842(b) (8) and (9) ofthe Act, and since the regulations merely establish the framework for determiningreasonable charge limits, this rule itself will not have a direct impacton the overall economy or on small entities. As noted in the previouslypublished proposed and final rules (51 FR 5726 and 51 FR 28710 respectively),we will include initial and final impact analyses of the specific effectson the economy and on small entities that we believe would result whenwe publish any limits under these rules. For these reasons, we have determined that a regulatory impact analysisis not required. Further, we have determined, and the Secretary certifies,that this final rule will not have a significant economic impact on a substantialnumber of small entities. We, therefore, have not prepared a regulatoryflexibility analysis. <ITAG tagnum="84">VI. Paperwork Requirements </ITAG>This rule contains no information collection requirements.

The criteria fordetermining what charges are reasonable include: <ITAG tagnum="37">* * * * * </ITAG>(7) Other factors that may be found necessary and appropriate with respectto a category of service to use in judging whether the charge is inherentlyreasonable. This includes special reasonable charge limits (which may beeither upper or lower limits) established by HCFA or a carrier if it determinesthat the standard rules for calculating reasonable charges set forth inthis subpart result in the grossly deficient or excessive charges. Thedetermination of these limits is described in paragraphs (g) and (h) ofthis section. (g) <T3>Determination of reasonable charges in special circumstances: General.</T3>HCFA or a carrier may establish special reasonable charge limits fora category of service if it determines that the standard rules for calculatingreasonable charges set forth in this subpart result in grossly deficientor excessive charges. The limit on the reasonable charge is an upper limitto correct a grossly excessive charge or a lower limit to correct a grosslydeficient charge. The limit is either a specific dollar amount, or is basedon a special method to be used in determining the reasonable charge. (1) <T3>Determination of excessive or deficient charges. </T3>HCFA or a carriermay make a determination that the standard rules for calculating reasonablecharges set forth in this subpart result in grossly deficient or excessivecharges. HCFA's determination may apply to the services of any supplier;however, a carrier's determination may apply only to nonphysician services.Examples of the circumstances which may result in grossly deficient orexcessive charges include, but are not limited to the following:  (i) The markeplace is not competitive. This includes circumstances in whichthe marketplace for a service is not truly competitive because a limitednumber of physicians perform the service. (ii) Medicare and Medicaid are the sole or primary sources of payment fora service. (iii) The charges involve the use of new technology for which an extensivecharge history does not exist. (iv) The charges do not reflect changing technology, increased facilitywith that technology, or changes in acquisition, production or suppliercosts. (v) The prevailing charges for a service in a particular locality are significantlyin excess of or below prevailing charges in other comparable localities,taking into account the relative costs of furnishing the services in thedifferent localities. (vi) Charges are grossly lower than or in excess of acquisition or productioncosts. (vii) There have been increases in charges for a service that cannot beexplained by inflation or technology. (viii) The prevailing charges for a service are substantially higher orlower than the payments made for the service by other purchasers in thesame locality. (2) <T3>Establishing a limit.</T3> In establishing a limit, HCFA or a carrierconsiders the available information that is relevant to the category ofservice and establishes a reasonable charge that is realistic and equitable.The factors to be considered in establishing a specific dollar amount orspecial method may include the following: (i) <T3>Price markup. </T3>This is the relationship between the retail andwholesale prices or manufacturer's costs of a category of service.
