Payload Systems Inc., a Wellesley, Mass.-based consulting concern, has contracted for some clients to conduct experiments involving protein crystals aboard the Soviet Union's Mir space station, a Commerce Department official said. The government approved the contract after reviewing it for the possible transfer of sensitive technology.    This will be the first time a U.S. experiment has been conducted aboard the Soviet space station. U.S. facilities generally haven't been available since the explosion of the shuttle Challenger in January 1986.    The Commerce spokesman explained that the experiments will be designed to learn more about the structure and production of protein crystals by growing them in the weightlessness of space. Protein crystals are used in making pharmaceuticals.    Anthony Arrott, research director of Payload Systems, said the company's clients were interested in using the Soviet station because it provided the opportunity for protein crystal manufacture over a longer period of time than would be afforded on a U.S. space shuttle.    Mr. Arrott said Payload is bound not to disclose terms of the contract with the Soviets. He said the company aimed to begin the experiments in 1989. </TEXT></DOC>
