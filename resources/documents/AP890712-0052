If the figures given Tuesday by Gen. Humberto Larios in hisannual report to the legislature are accurate, the casualtiesrepresent about 40 percent of the guerrilla army _ estimated at6,000 to 7,000 combatants.   Furthermore, if the general's figures are correct, the FarabundoMarti National Liberation Front has been extremely successful inattracting new recruits because its fighting force is not consideredto have diminished.   The insurgents maintain a constant and active presence in about athird of this Massachusetts-sized country.   Last year, 2,766 guerrillas were killed, wounded or captured,according to government figures. Larios said 455 government soldierswere killed in the year prior to June 1. He gave no breakdown ofguerrilla dead and wounded.   Foreign journalists and other independent observers consider botharmy and rebel figures on enemy casualties inflated.   Reporters have found that official and insurgent figures rarelycoincide with the number of bodies discovered following combat.   Larios, named to his post last month by President AlfredoCristiani, said the six nationwide elections held this decadedemonstrate ``rejection of the communist delinquents' hypothesisthat economic, political and social problems can only be resolved byviolence.''   Cristiani, of the rightist Republican Nationalist Alliance, tookoffice from Jose Napoleon Duarte of the Christian Democratic Partyon June 1. Duarte is terminally ill with cancer and was prevented bylaw from seeking re-election.   The Salvadoran military receives $85 million a year in aid fromthe United States, more than any armed forces in the WesternHemisphere.   Cristiani is trying to form a commission to represent thegovernment in talks with rebel representatives. Non-rightist sectorshave declined to participate, contending the proposed commissionwould not have sufficient authority to negotiate peace.   The rebels have said they will not participate in talks with anycommission that does not include sectors other than the governingparty and that does not have authority to negotiate. They sayCristiani is trying to engineer their surrender through theproposals for a dialogue.   An estimated 70,000 people, most of them civilians, have beenkilled in the nearly 10-year civil war.</TEXT></DOC>
