Food prices skyrocketed 1.2 percent _ three times the Augustrate and notice to consumers that the effects of the summer droughthave not yet played themselves out.   Much of the momentum for the gain in food costs came fromescalating beef prices as producers ended the herd liquidationsthat had depressed prices earlier in the drought cycle.   Countering that was a 3.3 percent drop in energy prices, whichreflected declines for all major fuels. Gasoline prices, up 3.8percent in August, fell 3.3 percent last month. Natural gas pricesfell 2.5 percent in September; home heating oil costs were down 4.6percent.   Labor Department analysts said these declines _ which sentenergy prices down at their steepest clip since January _ reflectedthe current battle among oil-producing nations over productionquotas.   The 0.4 percent September increase in prices for goods one stepshort of the retail level represented a moderation from the overall0.6 percent August advance.   The September gain translates to an annual rate of 4.5 percent.For the first nine months of 1988, wholesale prices rose at anannual rate of 4.3 percent, nearly double last year's 2.2 percentgain.   Many private economists believe that Americans will benefit fromthe world oil glut and say that, for all of 1988, inflation willaverage around 3.4 percent.   ``The basic balance is fairly clear. We have lower energy pricesoffsetting higher food prices,'' said David Wyss, an economist withData Resources Inc. of Lexington, Mass.   Wyss said falling energy prices along with a slowdown in thegeneral economy should help put a damper on inflationary pressuresfor the rest of the year.   Two other reports released by the government today providedevidence that the economy was slowing from a faster-than-expectedpace turned in during the first half of 1988.   The Commerce Department said that retail sales fell for a secondconsecutive month, dropping by 0.4 percent in September, indicatingsome slowing in consumer demand.   In the other report, the Federal Reserve said that industrialproduction remained unchanged in September, the first time it hasfailed to increase since February.   The wholesale price report showed higher prices for a variety ofgoods, not all the result of the drought.   In addition to the 4.2 percent gain in beef prices, fruit costsjumped 10.0 percent and vegetable prices jumped 16.5 percent.Prices also rose for coffee and dairy products, both up 1.5 percent.   Prices fell, however, for eggs, down 8.5 percent; pork, down 4.2percent, and rice, down 3.6 percent.   Department analyst Craig Howell said beef prices should risethrough the coming months as depressed supplies will keep costshigh.   In fact, prices paid to farmers for live cattle, the first stageat which wholesale prices are tracked, rose 1.1 percent inSeptember after a 1.5 percent August gain.   Another factor pushing prices higher in September was a 1.8percent increase in new automobile prices. Analysts said thisreflected lower end-of-the-model-year incentives to buyers thanwould normally be the case.   The September changes put the Labor Department's Producer PriceIndex for finished goods at 108.6, meaning that a hypotheticalselection of goods costing $100 at wholesale in 1982 would havecost $108.60 last month.   Unlike the percentage changes, the index numbers are notadjusted for seasonal variations, a process designed to removeperiodic, predictable effects from the calculations of pricemovements.   The government will release on Oct. 21 its report on pricechanges at the consumer level. Through August, consumer prices wererising at an annual rate of 4.6 percent, only slightly higher thanthe 4.4 percent gain for all of 1987.</TEXT></DOC>
