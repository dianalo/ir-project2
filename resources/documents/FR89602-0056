(2) Continue Analysis of availability data collected at FSEC and use thisto verify and extend existing theoretical models of daylight availability.(3) Continue to perform analyses, write papers, and develop improved designtools based upon the data collected at FSEC and elsewhere. (4) Continue supporting Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory (LBL) work in designtool development and evaluation. (5) Evaluate the relative merits of daylighting and energy efficient electriclighting in now-residential applications, for the benefit of the U.S. populationand electric utility operations. <T3>Eligibility: </T3>Eligibility for this renewal award is being limitedto FSEC an institute of higher education because of their high qualificationsin the fields of optical physics and fenestration system design and evaluation.2. The FSEC has experience in the design, development, testing, and useof an integrating sphere spectrophotometer for the measurement of the solaroptical properties of various materials. The Center, also, has experiencein developing and using a solar calorimeter for fenestration solar radiantheat gain measurements and a specialized fast-response, multi-channel photometerfor performing a variety of illumination measurements. This experiencewill be valuable in Task 1 and 4, assiting LBL in analyzing fenestrationphotometry data, and in improving the method of performing these measurements.The FSEC has an optical laboratory designed for both indoor and outdoortests of the solar radiant heat gain and light transmittance and distributionof various fenestration materials and components. This laboratory willbe valuable for the performance of tests required to accomplish Task 1,3, and 4. The term of this renewal shall be from January 1, 1989 through December31, 1989. </ITAG><ITAG tagnum="10"><T2>FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:</T2>U.S. Department of Energy, Officeof Procurement Operations, Attn: Rosemarie H.
